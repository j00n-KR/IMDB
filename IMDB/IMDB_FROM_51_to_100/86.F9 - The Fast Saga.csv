0,SnoopyStyle,Leprechaun 4,6,6 August 2021,The gang receives a transmission with Mr. Nobody. He had captured Cipher but the plane has crashed. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is reluctant to go on another mission and risk his family but Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) convinces him. There is a MacGuffin and Dom's newly revealed brother Jakob (John Cena). Family...The full title is Leprechaun 4: In Space. It's a bit of an insult to tag your movie In Space. Leprechaun is a campy horror-comedy franchise and its self-mocking humor uses the insult to its advantage. F&F has been approaching that line over the years and it may be a moment of jumping the shark. F&F started originally as a semi-serious fun cars & babes franchise. The action has gotten more and more ridiculous to the point of superhero unreality. Tyrese Gibson is doing a meta commentary while questioning his invulnerability. It's fitting that he and Ludacris are the ones going into space. Tyrese is the silly comic relief but it's getting out of hand. This series is being so ridiculous that it is almost critic-proof in that respect. No nay-sayer is going to win an argument by pointing out the outlandish non-sensical action scenes. We already know and it's why we watch the movies. It is what it is at this point.,F9 - The Fast Saga
1,Prismark10,Fast & Furious 9,6,4 August 2021,This time it's personal for Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel.) A cryptic message from Mr Nobody puts Dom head to head with his younger brother Jakob (John Cena.)Dom blames Jakob for the death of their father who died in a racing accident.Jakob went into the spy game. He is now trying to obtain a gadget split into two halves the key to activate it.F9 is simply a ludicrous high octane action movie.Most of the stunts defy gravity. There is a segment set in space. The story makes little sense with another character coming back from the dead.Even the younger versions of Dom and Jakob look nothing like their older counterparts.At least as a popcorn film it is magnetic fun.,F9 - The Fast Saga
2,nogodnomasters,Peace is Chaos,6,13 June 2021,"The crew once again comes together and saves the world. They had to create a past and make John Cena the brother of Vin Diesel and the bad guy. Jordana Brewster is back and Helen Mirren in a cameo. No Jason Stratham, but we do get Charlize Theron as the bad girl.The plot is immaterial. There is more car wreckage than what Bruce Willis did to Moscow. Roof top jumping becomes bus/truck top jumping. There is a scene which pokes fun at the FF series by discussing the infinite impossible missions that they go on and they don't die, or even get a scratch.And of course all ends well with the extended family meal.I learned you can drive through a mine field but you must be going 80 MPH or more. If you zig-zag when running away from someone shooting at you with an automatic weapon, you never get hit. Nobody know how to shoot out a tire. The Pontiac Fiero (plot spoiler) is rated for the icy vacuum of outer space. And Yoda was a puppet. Grab the popcorn, leave your mind at the door.",F9 - The Fast Saga
3,kosmasp,Cannot delete,6,18 July 2021,"Why did you come here? What do you expect? The fast Saga - a movie that makes not much sense, but is pure ""popcorn"" if there is such a thing. We have new ""milestones"" ahead of us though. One is family related - pun intended, as is the cliche we get served here. Talking of cliches we get a beloved character back ... like they used to do in soaps ... because ... there are no rules.Well no rules that the real world would set - boundaries and all that. I mean even Paul Walkers character is still alive in this - even if we never see him. He is family - and family holds together and never dies (are they Goonies?).80s movie reference aside this is what fans should and probably will expect. Including the long awaited and completely insane ... well out of this world moment! And then add some of the most insane stunts and this should be one of the craziest (best?) movie/theatre experiences you can get.Again it doesn't make much sense (or any to be fair), but it is fun to watch. And why should you not have fun ... the soundtrack is hot, the muscles and the cars are hot ... the players are hot ... there is literally nothing that is below ""hot"" ... well there is one moment that is described as cold ... fair enough, but other than that: Hot! Even new additions to the cast - ones that probably are going to return and some that are just flavor of the month/fan service ... get with it or leave it seems to be what the movie is suggesting ...",F9 - The Fast Saga
4,jboothmillard,Fast & Furious 9,5,8 July 2021,"I'm a bit 50/50 when it comes to the Fast & Furious franchise, they are over-the-top, and I can't keep up with which one is which (apart from Furious 7 which suffered the sad death of Paul Walker). On the other hand, tut they are kind of fun because they are so ridiculous, and the speedy and cool looking cars chasing and getting smashed is good. This ninth instalment was the first film in the franchise I went to see at the cinema, directed by Justin Lin (Fast & Furious 5, Star Trek Beyond). Basically, it opens in 1989, where Jack Toretto (J. D. Pardo) participates in a race, with his sons Dominic (Vinnie Bennett) and Jakob (Finn Cole) in his pit crew. After a pit stop, and Dom arguing with rival racer Kenny Linder (Jim Parrack), Jack returns to the race and is clipped by Linder's car. This causes his car to crash into the wall, flip and explode, killing him. After the crash, Dom fights with Linder and nearly beats him to death, he is arrested and serves time in prison. In the present, two years after confronting cyberterrorist Cipher (Charlize Theron), Dom (Vin Diesel) is retired, raising his son Brian (Isaac Holtane) with his wife, Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) on a farm. Dom's former team members Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) arrive to tell him that Cipher was being transported by intelligence operative Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) on a plane. But the plane was attacked by rogue agents, crashing in Montecito, Central America, and the team need Dom's help finding Mr. Nobody. The team track the location of the plane from a distress signal. They also find part of a device named Ares, which can hack into any computer-controlled weapons system. They are then ambushed by a private army led by Dom's brother, Jakob (John Cena), who Dom realised is involved. There is a perilous through the wilderness and at the edges of the high cliffs, with Jakob managing to steal the device, and be picked up in his car by a large magnet on a helicopter. The team team rendezvous with Michael Stasiak (Shea Whigham) on the way to their safe house. Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) wishes to help, and Dom reluctantly lets her join the team. Letty and Mia investigate when the team are told that Han Lue (Sung Kang), thought to be dead, has something to do with Ares. Meanwhile, Jakob meets with his associate Otto (Thue Ersted Rasmussen). Cipher is still incarcerated, being held in a glass containment unit; she has failed to sway Jakob and tells Otto that the other half of Ares is in Edinburgh. Dom meets Buddy (Michael Rooker), his father's former mechanic, who took Jakob in after his exile, and learns that Jakob is in London. Letty and Mia find Han, still alive, in Tokyo, along with his ward Elle (Anna Sawai). Roman and Tej recruit Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), Twinkie (Shad Moss, aka 'Bow Wow'), and Earl Hu (Jason Tobin), who have been working on a ""rocket car"". In London, Dom meets Queenie Shaw (Dame Helen Mirren), who gives him Jakob's location. Dom confronts Otto and Jakob, who tells Dom to leave. Otto has Dom apprehended by Interpol agents, but he is rescued by old friend Leysa (Cardi B) and her squad of mercenaries. Tej, Roman, and Ramsey join Dom in Edinburgh, where Jakob uses a highly powerful electromagnetic weapon to generate field to steal the second Ares device. Tej and Roman find the truck containing the electromagnet. They fight Otto's men, while Ramsey commandeers the truck to chase after Otto. Dom pursues Jakob and the two of them fight throughout the city. Before Otto can pick up Jakob, Ramsey runs his car off the road, and uses the electromagnet to capture Jakob. Cipher is recruited by Otto to help him find Jakob. At the safe house, Han reveals he was assigned to protect Elle and Ares, as Elle's DNA is the key to the weapons activation. When one of Mr. Nobody's agents went rogue, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) helped to fake Han's death, for Elle's protection. Otto attacks the safe house and frees Jakob, who was the rogue agent. Dom had always believed it was Jakob that was the one responsible for causing their father's car to crash, after tampering with it. Jakob reveals that their father was in debt, he instructed Jakob to tamper with his car so he could intentionally throw the race, but this went wrong with Linder's interference. Jakob and Otto kidnap Elle and take the second Ares device. Otto then launches a satellite into orbit, while Jakob has Elle activate Ares. They begin uploading Ares to the satellite, moving in an armoured truck throughout Tbilisi. Despite its previously failed tests and some complications, the rocket car seems ready for launch, and Tej and Roman enter orbit. Dom, Letty, Mia, Ramsey, and Han chase after the truck to stop the upload. While Mia and Han try to breach the truck, Otto reveals he has no more use for Jakob, and throws him off the truck. Dom and Mia save him, and Jakob decides to help. In the rocket car, Tej and Roman ram themselves into the satellite, stopping the upload. An attack jet, being piloted by Cipher. Arrives and bombs the trucks, Otto is killed while the jet is trying to kill Dom. It is revealed that Cipher was flying the jet remotely when it is destroyed by Dom using the ricocheting truck to collide into it. Dom and Mia reconcile with Jakob and allow him to escape in Dom's car. A spaceship returns Tej and Roman to Earth. The team celebrates their success with a barbecue, and they are surprised when Brian O'Conner (unseen) arrives in his car. During the credits, it is revealed that Deckard is alive, and Han arrives at his door. Also starring Don Omar as Rico Santos, Siena Agudong as Young Mia, Azia Dinea Hale as Young Letty, Juju Zhang as Young Elle. Diesel remains reliable as the leader of the gang, Cena is a good new addition as the initial baddie, Theron has fun being back as the villainess, and the other cast members are all fine. There is no doubt this is the most over-the-top and ridiculous sequel (a car going to space!?), but with cool cars, high speed chases filled with crashes and explosions, and a good number of stunts, at least it is not boring, a reasonable action thriller. Worth watching!",F9 - The Fast Saga
5,paul_haakonsen,This movie was so bad that it became a joke...,5,29 July 2021,"As Tej (played by Ludacris) says in the movie: ""as long as we obey the laws of physics, then we'll be fine, okay?""Yeah, that concept is right out the window in this movie. Literally. But hey, at least this 2021 movie titled ""F9"" made for some really good laughs.Granted, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from director Justin Lin's movie here, as the franchise has been one steady downhill ride since after the first movie. And with each movie things become more and more outrageous and out of hand. In fact, by now the movie franchise ought to be renamed into ""The Outrageous and Ludicrous"".Still, I had the opportunity to watch ""F9"", and so I did, as I hadn't already seen it. And yeah, ""F9"" was as laughable as I had anticipated it.Actually, Cipher (played by Charlize Theron) actually summarized how I was feeling throughout the entire movie here, with one single line that she uttered in the movie; ""you got to be kidding me.""Visually then ""F9"" was good. Yeah, I will say that much, because the visuals definitely are top notch and help carry the movie, as basically everything else in the movie wasn't doing much for the movie.And yeah, they had a very impressive cast ensemble for ""F9"", I will admit that much. What does amaze me, however, is that people on the cast list don't stop up and go ""really?"" when they read the script. But I guess, a dollar is a dollar, huh?If you sit down to watch ""F9"", you have to put aside anything called laws of physics and realism. Because all those concepts are non-existing in this movie. And the abundance of things that was downright laughable and outrageous in ""F9"" is countless, but at least they provided me with a heap of laughs. Yeah, I couldn't help laugh throughout the majority of this movie, because it was just so bad.""F9"" is a watchable movie, but it is essentially just another testimony to why the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise should have stopped after ""Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift"".I am rating ""F9"" a very bland and mediocre five out of ten stars. This is a movie that left no impressions on me, and it is one that will just quietly fade into oblivion, given its ludicrous over-the-top lack of respect for laws of physics, gravity and realism.",F9 - The Fast Saga
6,CinemaSerf,F-No!,6,14 September 2021,"Well they did sub-title this a ""saga"", but I wasn't quite expecting something this poor. Things didn't auger well when the cinema screen broke down and we were turfed out after thirty minutes. Next week, back for part two - complete with ""an opportunity to refresh our memories"" as the cinema lad put it... Sadly, though, the first half hour provides us with easily the most entertaining elements of this otherwise weak story bereft of just about everything bar some super stunts/visual effects and Charlize Theron locked up in a plastic cage. There is some effort made to create some characters, and Vin Diesel does bring a certain degree of charisma to the screen, but after an initial flurry of decent motor sport action, we drop from a great height into a family revenge/melodrama that has only one, entirely predictable, conclusion. It is a piece of harmless escapism that serves to divert us from reality for an extremely overlong 2 hrs and 20 minutes but this franchise really misses Paul Walker and although I'm sure nobody will listen, this is not much of a testament to his memory and ought to be the last unless someone is going to revamp the concept thoroughly and invest in solid stories and characters to compliment the endless, and increasingly sterile, visuals. I want one of those planes, though....",F9 - The Fast Saga
7,zardoz-13,"""F9"" Flies Off of Handle But Is Fun!",5,20 July 2021,"Hollywood film franchises that rack up double digit numbers are rare. Counting the Dewayne Johnson & Jason Statham spin-off saga ""Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"" Universal Pictures has released ten installments in this four-wheeled fantasy franchise since the initial ""The Fast & The Furious"" (2001). Purists may argue only those with Vin Diesel should be counted. Remember, Diesel skipped ""2 Fast & 2 Furious"" (2003) and showed up strictly for an end credits cameo in ""The Fast & The Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006). Meanwhile, the exclusion of one star need not spoil a franchise. Remember Paul Walker's character Brian O'Conner? After Walker died in a real-life car crash, the producers supplemented CGI footage of his two brothers Cody and Caleb standing-in for him. Actors have come and gone throughout this franchise. Michelle Rodriguez co-starred in the first film as Letty Ortiz. She reprised her role for ""Fast & Furious"" (2009) but got cremated in an off-screen car crash. Rodriguez made a still photo cameo at the end of ""Fast Five"" (2011). Eventually, Letty returned for ""Fast & Furious 6"" (2013), after suffering from a bout of temporary amnesia. The same holds true for other characters, like Matt Schulze's Vince in the first ""Furious."" Surviving the original, Vince died eventually in ""Fast Five."" Han Lue (Sung Kang) co-starred in four ""Fast & Furious"" films before he died early in ""Fast & Furious 7"" (2015). Mind you, few film franchises have weathered as many upheavals as ""The Fast & The Furious."" Inevitably, the stories have shifted their focus from domestic to international crime. During those twenty years, audiences have changed, but ""The Fast & The Furious"" has never slowed down. Reportedly, a double-header ending is in the works, with the finale stretched across two films.Sibling rivalry fuels the latest entry in the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise, ""F9: The Fast Saga,"" with Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Vin Diesel) battling in a life and death clash with his estranged younger brother Jakob (John Cena of ""Blocker"") over the acquisition of a globular gadget split into two halves. Everything in ""F9"" rides on this MacGuffin, and it is referred to simply as Project Aries. Basically, any item, object, or idea the heroes and villains fight over qualifies as a MacGuffin. Typically, once the MacGuffin is exposed and explained, the characters contend with its aftermath. This DNA-coded digital doomsday device enables its' user to hack into any computerized weaponry platform and control it from a satellite. Jakob and his affluent accomplice Otto (newcomer Thue Ersted Rasmussen), the son of a dictator, has his own deep pockets and an army of anonymous commandos clad in black helmets and Kevlar suits. The origins of Dom's feud with his baby brother Jakob began in 1989, when both served their father, Jack Toretto (J. D. Pardo of ""Supercross""), as members of his pit crew at a California speedway track. Jack died under bizarre circumstances. Dom suspects Jakob had a hand in Jack's demise. The elder Toretto collided with another racer. As it tumbled skyward over other race cars, Toretto's car burst into flames, and he died. Afterward, Dom whipped Jakob in an illegal street race, and a disgraced Jakob left L. A. and vanished into exile.""F9"" alternates the prequel part of its plot, which brings audiences up to snuff on the Toretto family history, casting entirely different actors as their youthful counterparts, with the contemporary sequel plot featuring Diesel and Cena at odds after their father's demise over Project Aries. Along the way, in a race to seize the two Aries spheres and its key, another member of the old Toretto gang returns from the dead-Han (Sung Kang of ""Bullet to the Head"")--with the DNA key to Aries. Predictably, everybody is surprised and shocked at Han's return. Mind you, Dom isn't exactly eager initially to come out of hiding from his isolated ranch to help Roman (Tyrese Gibson of ""Baby Boy""), Tej (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges of ""John Henry"") and cyber specialist Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel of ""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"") search the ruins of Mr. Nobody's crashed plane. Kurt Russell shows up momentarily as Mr. Nobody in a cameo on a computer screen where he sends an emergency message to Ramsey about the MacGuffin. Letty leaves Dom to join Roman and company, and this prompts Dom into action. Writer & director Justin Lin, who helmed four earlier ""Fast & Furious"" sequels: ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"" ""Fast & Furious,"" ""Fast Five,"" and ""Fast & Furious 6,"" knows the franchise from bumper to bumper. Unfortunately, most of the entertaining sequences, with cars literally going airborne, are hopelessly outlandish. The attack on an armored truck, which resembles an armored train, careening through a major city, with bullets swarming around it like locust, involving the use of incredibly powerful electromagnets, is just as far-fetched. Far from its street racing origins, ""F9"" delivers high-octane, adrenalin-laced stunts that look reasonable but are impossible. Despite being the least believable ""Fast & Furious"" entry, ""F9"" raises the bar impossibly high for the future of the franchise.",F9 - The Fast Saga
8,neil-476,Highly entertaining nonsense,7,1 July 2021,"Despite having settled into domestic harmony with Lettie and his curly haired son who I thought was a daughter, Dom is called back to carry out further stunt-based shenanigans in pursuit of foiling a criminal conspiracy involving old foe Cypher and also his brother (his brother? Yes, that's what the rest of the cast asked. Well, all except Lettie and sister Mia).As usual, the plot is little more than an excuse for a succession of ever more outrageous car-based stunts mixed up with homilies about the importance of families. Family in this case includes the cast, with upwards of 10 members having appeared in earlier episodes.The stunts are, as usual, an absolute hoot, especially the final one. You thought outracing a nuclear submarine across pack ice was ridiculous? Just wait until you've seen - no, I won't spoil it.Vin Diesel's acting limitations show - he can't do Holding A Grudge Against His Brother very well - but this doesn't matter in the slightest.",F9 - The Fast Saga
9,trashgang,completely over the top,6,20 August 2021,"This franchise moves further and furtheraway from what it should be, car chases and all about cars. They do things with cars but it becomes all a bit exaggerated and laughable.Effects are above mediocre that's for sure but the story is sometimes a bit over the top even so, car in space and the bridge scene, that you can't take it all that serious and if you does then you will hate this one.If you can stand the unbelievable story then you will like F9. Still there are a few muscle cars to watch here and there and again, german cars are the big losers here, it's all about US cars and Japanese cars.Gore 0/5

10,siderite,An average FF movie. Car junkies in spaaaaace!,7,30 July 2021,"OK, so this film not only doesn't take itself seriously, but is constantly mocking itself, with jewels like ""If this were a movie..."" or ""as long as we obey of laws of physics, then we'll be fine"" or ""We've taken out
cars, trains, tanks. And yet we're still here"". Almost no scene makes any reasonable sense. I guess if you watched all the other Fast and Furious movies you will watch this one, but the degree of ridiculousness that they got to deserves... a lot of praise. I mean, one just has to admit that few people would have thought of the things they thought of. Things make so little sense that they need a huge degree of creativity and imagination to conceive.There are two scenes that really rubbed me the wrong way. One of them is that with Cardy B and ""her crew"" of girls. She just appears for a minute in what seems to be a promo for a never to be made (hopefully) all female Fast and Furious. And it shows that she can never be an actress no matter what she does. The second is when they go with a car with rocket engines attached to it in space. I mean, there are more things wrong with those few minutes than with the rest of the movie, and that is saying a lot!Bottom line: turn off your brain COMPLETELY and enjoy the ride. Because it does feel like a ride for children. When Disney drives Star Wars into the ground and people forget about Pirates of the Caribbean, they can easily turn F&F into a car themed rollercoaster ride.",F9 - The Fast Saga
11,thesar-2,Mission: Very Possible,3,27 June 2021,"At least they didn't F-up the franchise, but they were definitely on Fumes with no gas station in sight.It took me two-thirds of the movie before I realized what the title was referring to and it was: the nine flashbacks. It wouldn't even be unfair to say: 1/3 of this movie is freaking flashbacks - almost as if they really didn't have enough story (spoiler, they didn't) to fill the unnecessary 2½ hour runtime.Obviously, you can't expect much from this series that was originally a remake and began one way and then became the weakest and most generic Mission: Impossible rip-off. But, about half of the 10 (including the highly superior spin-off, Hobbs & Shaw) had enough charismatic characters, depth and humor to make them watchable. This one had thee most sleepy and phoned-in actors and I kept envisioning Vin yelling cut on his own for his every two-hour nap.The ""Family's"" back and with a DC-Level mission of getting the McGuffin before a madman controls the world. And the stakes could never, ever be...lower. You learn real fast (in the franchise, really) that no death is forever, except, comically, for the one character they purposely, and foolishly, kept alive when he died in real life.Yeah, yet another character from the dead reappears with a Saw-like recon explanation. I don't even have to spoil it for you as he's right on the movie poster. So, why that was such a reveal in the film was kinda unintentionally hilarious.I know I'm talking down about a part 9 in a bruh franchise, but admittedly, I liked a few scenes, minor characters and unbelievably, it didn't feel 145 minutes EVEN with the stale, slowed down monologues. The opening action scene was nice (with the exception of the bridge. I KNOW I'm supposed to suspend disbelief for the impossible stunts performed, but I almost wanted to walk out when the bridge was used twice, and was progressively eyerolling - and that was only 20 minutes in!) and the movie was saved by the fun climax and great use of magnets. Also, Sung Kang is just so breathtakingly gorgeous, he was good enough eye-candy for the brief scenes he was in.Sadly, the great set-up characters from the past: Kurt Russell's Mr. Nobody, Helen Mirren's Queenie (though her scene ROCKED) and the extremely talented and gorgeous Charlize Theron and her character, Cipher, were all sidelined so we could get more of Sleepy Diesel. I was most disappointed in Cipher who was mostly reduced to a Hannibal Lecter/Magneto/Raoul Silva (from Skyfall) guest star.Overall, it was very run-of-the-mill almost like they were contracted to make 10 films and they just ran out of ideas when Paul Walker tragically left. It's worth watching if you're a fan of the series, but if you're not, it's best just to get this free on Netflix.***Final Thoughts: I've only seen this entire franchise once each. Never, ever had a desire to see one twice. So, this ranking is just from memory:Best...to worst Fast & Furious movies:1. Hobbs & Shaw (2019) 4/5 Stars

(9) hobbs and shaw 2/10...in my review for hobbs and shaw, i said i hope f9 doesn't continue with the madness introduced in that movie. And in a way it doesn't. There are no super soldiers. And it doesn't switch to the sci-fi genre (for the most part). But in another way, it continues exactly where hobbs and shaw left off. Completely ridiculous action that is not the least bit believable and disregards the most basic laws of physics.And i could tell from the first action scene. I tried to be patient, but it got worse and worse. This series has always pushed the limits, but they've lost all restraint and do whatever they want, no matter how stupid. I groaned and rolled my eyes so many times. Some parts were so dumb that i straight up closed my eyes for 5 seconds cause i couldn't handle it. And it's not just a random thing here or there. It's the majority of the action.A quote from my hobbs and shaw review: ""I always say the best action movies toe the line between improbable and impossible. To quote joey from friends, 'you're so far past the line that you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!' lmao.""On top of that, none of it is good. Even if you suspend disbelief, nothing about the action is impressive. Not one scene wowed me or gave me goosebumps. Even the fight scenes are crap. At one point i stopped caring about the action at all. And this is coming from an action junkie. By comparison, f8 had multiple BEASTLY action scenes that had my jaw dropped.Aside from the action, this movie just isn't good. The story is useless. They tried to have character moments, but they didn't work for me. Which is odd because i'm already invested in all these characters. Most of the comedy doesn't work. And some of it is done at the expense of realism (they do something that makes no sense so they can joke about it).My other biggest gripe: rewriting history. Apparently the trailer spoiled this, which is why i don't watch trailers. But they are pooping on their own franchise by changing past events. And you can argue that the franchise has done this before, but it was more of adding on to the story. Whereas with this movie, it really feels like they were pulling stuff out of their buttsdid i mention it's really dumb? Unfathomably dumb. You know the overused phrase ""i could feel myself getting dumber""? I really really could. I found myself mouth-breathing with my eye lids half shut lolWhat a waste of charlize theron. I was so happy she survived f8. She's a BEAST of an actress (FURIOSA!), and i liked her villain. But she was literally in a box for the majority of the movie. Also, the Rock has become a staple of this franchise. Why is he not in this movie? Instead we get john cena. Sigh.Racking my brain trying to come up with a positive. All i got is the musical score. Or at least one track was awesome. They played it during the end credits.My entire theater clapped when it finished. Ppl are stupid. But that means we'll probably get another one. Hopefully they can right the ship. But i don't have much confidence in that happening.There is so much more i can talk about. I can't remember it all. But i'm sad and disappointed. My wait for good post-pandemic movies continues. So far i can think of one (a quiet place 2). And that's out of like 15-20 movies i've seen. (1 viewing, 6/24/2021)",F9 - The Fast Saga

It was well paced by a veteran of a series Justin Lin - at running time 2 h 20 min i barely was bored. I liked the craftsmanship of this movie - you can clearly see that a lot of money were spent into making this one. The last action sequence alone was made in a daylight - those cost way more so i have to give a credit for it. Sure, the story is your typical stuff about saving the world, i just kinda went with it and had fun.Overall, definitely not a worst in a series (4th i think is still the weakest one), but far from the best (i love 3rd and 5th parts), F9 is big, very dumb but skilfully made movie that is entertaining. Sometimes that is all you want to see.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Then add in the usual baddies out to get the super weapon to conquer humanity - again. No acting required; no intelligent dialogue needed, just a good personal trainer to get muscles for tight T's. 2 & 1/2 hours (thank you ff) as a litmus test on how we use our time to better our selves.",F9 - The Fast Saga
18,The-Sarkologist,You Get What You Expect,6,24 June 2021,"The Fast and the furious has definitely changed a lot since the original films, and this one is no exception. Mind you, I do wonder how they managed to get up the previous film in the series, and also continue to pump out films in the way that they have, but they seem to be able to do this. Another thing is that this film is something like two and a half hours long, but despite that it certainly doesn't disappoint, and it even drops some hints as to what is coming in the next film (though I suspect that we won't be seeing Dwayne Johnson returning - I can see how he and Vin Diesel will end up clashing).The film pretty much follows the formula that we have from the previous films, namely that they happens to be some off the books black ops who go around solving problems, and driving cars. Sure, they started off with some pretty hot cars, but they seem to pretty much go for anything these days, and it has ended up being more of an action film than a car racing film, it is just that they still have lots of car chases in it. As for the action sequences, as you can expect, they are pretty off the wall, which is another thing one comes to expect from this franchise - sure they are unrealistic, but we don't come to the cinemas to see realism.We also get to learn more about Dom's backstory here, namely because his brother is introduced, and if the previous films are anything to go by, we know what ends up happening with his brother. We also have Cypher brought in from the previous films as well, though I'm not entirely sure what happened to Nobody, but then again, when it comes to Fast & the Furious, people don't tend to stay dead (which means that Nobody is probably around somewhere). In fact, it is revealed that one of the characters that we thought was dead, actually isn't dead.Look, this film isn't bad, and as I've mentioned multiple times, it isn't serious, and it is just a typical action film, and a pretty good one at that. The story is interesting, but fairly similar to what we have come to expect from the previous ones, which means traveling the world and driving fast cars, and playing with some interesting hardware. In fact, they all decide to use magnets in this film to devastating effect. Oh, and we end up smashing up a lot of things as well.Mind you, I don't want to give too much away, though when I watched the trailer I sort of felt they were doing a pretty good job of giving the whole film away anyway. However, it turns out that they don't, and all the best scenes aren't in the trailers. Yeah, if you like the franchise, or if you just like a good old action flick, then this film will not disappoint.",F9 - The Fast Saga
19,UniqueParticle,Saw in IMAX which was quite epic!,8,25 June 2021,"I think the people in charge of IMDB should add Sci-Fi to the genres and I understand the hate. Regardless of the flaws especially one being there's probably 20 parts where some of the characters should've died I hope I'm not the only one to feel this way otherwise Fast 9 is exhilarating fun most of the way of through. A hilarious side note the theater I go to has recliner seats and someone fairly fat broke the seat to the right of me lol! The best aspects are the action, comedy, and the cinematography; the story is kinda cheesy. Like my review or don't but I'm being nice with my rating.

20,Thanos_Alfie,Below average...,4,10 October 2021,"""F9"" is an Action - Crime movie and the ninth movie of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, in we watch the crew getting back together for another mission but this time we find out that Dom and Mia have another brother who is an international terrorist.I have watched all the previous movies and my favorite still is ""Fast Five"". I believe that the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise lost its way and this was obvious in this movie. I am not saying that ""F9"" is not an entertaining movie, I am just saying that is not the best of it and it was a bit confusing. The direction which was made by Justin Lin was below average and I think that he did not reach his potential. He also lost his way when he failed to present something at least realistic as it was in the previous movies. All in all, I have to say that ""F9"" is not the best movie and I suggest you to lower your standards or your expectations before watching it otherwise you will be disappointed.",F9 - The Fast Saga
21,cruise01,Ridiculous over the top action but a lot of fun.,10,28 June 2021,"5 out of 5 stars.F9 takes the action to a whole new level of ridiculous. Always going big and insane. If your looking for a mindless summer action flick. Definitely the film for you. It is big, loud, and fun.The story is great. Following Dom going after his brother Jakob played by John Cena. Who is a fun addition to see him going head to head with Vin Diesel. The film does give some flashbacks to Dom and Jakob earlier years which was interesting to see. Which helps give that background story to these characters. The film concept does mess with powerful magnets which can cause cars to flip.A lot of characters return which was fun to see. A lot back in action. The cast ensemble is great. Only getting bigger through sequels.The action sequences are over the top and awesome. It can be cheesy. But this film is just trying to entertain which it does it well. Justin Lin direction is great. He can deliver action and lots of car destruction.A great action film and fun addition to the series. Plus a mid credit scene which would be fun to see where they go next.",F9 - The Fast Saga
22,SAMTHEBESTEST,This Furious ride is visually stronger than before but has weakened drastically in storytelling and writing.,5,29 July 2021,"F9 : The Fast Saga (2021) :-
Movie Review -When this franchise The Fast And The Furious begun in 2001, nobody had imagined that it will go on long and become so Big globally. The earlier films in the franchise couldn't score big but were recieved fairly by critics as well as audience. After some time, people got used to it and then the 7th Film went on to do huge business at box because by the boost of an ultimate tribute to Paul Walker. Even the last film, the 8th one opened big at box office and the spin-off did well too. F9 was struck because of pandemic but finally it came out after an year and here we are. The fact can't be denied that the franchise has fallen drastically with its content and storytelling in last couple of years and the Visual expansion of Cinematic experience was the only thing which has kept it alive. With F9, the franchise is stronger than before with some insane car stunts and super explosions but the storytelling has weakened by the courtesy old school filmmaking. To be honest, there was or is nothing much left in this franchise as for the narrative because they have used almost all the elements before. Now, it's just about stunts, action and breathtaking visuals and nothing else. Not a cent more than that.F9 has a very outdated storyline that should be lashed out by smart viewers. Cipher enlists the help of Jakob, Dom's younger brother to take revenge on Dom and his team. It all begins without any clues, without any concrete theories just to make things look dramatic. All of sudden, we travel way back to Dom's past, his father's death and abandoned brother who appears quite as a shock in the opening scene with his own army and high-tech plans. Once a mission, it suddenly becomes a rivalry of brothers but for what? No clues there. Unauthentic is the word. It might just annoy you some times with those same old cliched dialogues and punches and for the new heights it goes on to find references from the 'Star Wars' franchise. Overall, it's Terribly outdated and boring.Furious franchise has never been known for the acting and this one is no different. All the actors does the same what they have been doing since forever but what saddens is the improper use of characters. A Fast & Furious film without Dwayne Johnson? Seriously? Why? Vin Diesel had to show off his muscles because of Dwayne's absence and that too against John Cena, are you kidding? Just imagine the face off between Dwayne Johnson and John Cena in the film, outside WWE rings. Wouldn't it have been freaking amazing??? I wonder, how makers didn't think about it. A big loss. Rest, there is nothing much to talk about Rodriguez, Thereon (more like a cameo), typical Gibson and Brewster.Coming to the best parts of the film, the action, the stunts and the visuals everything is top notch. Few stunts are completely unimaginable and even though they are illogical, the entertainment value is sky high. This time the ride has gone higher, i mean in space, yes believe it if you could. Unfortunately, it has forgotten to stay on ground. Justin Lin lacks the conviction while showcasing those out of the world sequences. It may sound crazy but like I said before, this franchise was never meant to make much sense so, just seat tight and ride on it. Keep your brain on the backseat and enjoy the humongous and unbelievable entertainer. Not that bad to be slammed completely, but yes the drastic fall can be noticed and can't be ignored. Overall, a watchable ride but nothing new except for the sky-high imagination and practicals of cinematic visuals.RATING - 5/10*",F9 - The Fast Saga
23,Vartiainen,"Slightly sillier and more repetitive than I'd prefer, but still pretty good",6,22 October 2021,"F9 once again takes us on a crazy journey across the globe as Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family of misfits are once again threatened by someone with a bone to pick with them. This time that someone is one closer to home than you'd expect.What can I say? It's yet another Fast & Furious film. You're going to get fast cars, great stunts, good music, exotic locations and a whole pile of quips as these already familiar characters interact with one another.And it works. It's why this franchise has managed to last this long. The formula is a good one. I'd only wish I wasn't as aware of it as I was with this film. This is very by the numbers kind of franchise film. Which is not always a bad thing, but rarely is it a good one either.I'm also getting a little concerned about these stunts. They're starting to get... silly. I mean, it's a good thing that the franchise is supposedly soon ending. Because at this rate they'd be jumping from galaxy to galaxy by film fifteen.Still, I can't say I didn't enjoy myself. These are some of the best popcorn films currently being made and you should not expect anything different.",F9 - The Fast Saga
24,subxerogravity,"I think the ""Carvengers"" are running on fumes",6,26 June 2021,"As a fan of the franchise, I liked it but this one didn't click for me like the others.One thing the Fast and The Furious has going for it for the last 20 years is that the squeals get better. With maybe the exception of Tokyo Drift (which in fairness I just have not seen in years) each sequel is better than the last one. I feel that each sequel steps up the game and adds something (like how John Singleton simply added fancier cars that turn corners to make 2 Fast 2 Furious better than The Fast and The Furious or how Fast Five shifted that franchise from street racing to a heist film and Furious 7, as I love to say turn them into the ""Carvengers"").As much as I love Fast nine as a fan of the franchise as this movie gives you some great Fan service all Fast geeks are going to be into. I can honestly say this is not my favorite Fast film. My favorite Fast film is usually the last Fast film, but that does not hold true here. The Fate of the Furious is still my favorite (actually, Fast Five is my favorite, but the point I'm making is...) I don't know where I rank this film but it's not close to the top at all.From the start it was not Fast enough. That's ironic considering that the plot of the movie happens pretty Fast (I would explain it but its one of those useless plots to get the action going). Now all the Fast movies have those slow moments that allows Dom to give his speech on how family is everything but in this film those speeches feel flat. The banter between Tej and Roman was pretty weak as well. Ramon did not get to be his funny self at all.I felt this movie did not know where it wanted to go. On one side it felt far more dramatic than any Fast movie I've seen. On the other side...every Fast movie has the moment of super heroics that takes you out of the reality of this universe (and into the reality of the Carvengers). It's usually one spontaneous feat of strength that makes you raise an eye brow in the instant because of how reflectively cool it is but becomes stupider as the excitement wears off. Fast Five was bold enough to attempt an entire third act on this moment and though I appreciate that fact that they allowed Tej and Roman to have this moment over Dom they held if for far too long. It was a great and interesting attempt to allow Tyrese to grow up in the film when he really did not have to. Plus, the ridiculousness of it all contradicted the seriousness of some of these scenes and just did nothing for me.In it's attempts to bite the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it becomes over bloated with fanfare. It's not the first movie to do this but it feels really force here. Unlike at the end of Avengers: End Game where it seemed unbelievable, they got all these people in one room when they did, fast 9 is very believable that no one was in the same room even if they were. It was like who can we get for this amount of money and time and it shows to the point that Fast 9 has plot holes they could not hide with good action.Fast and Furious already proved in this universe dead does not need to be dead which explains one's character's overrated comeback (Sorry but it's true they could have done this way better). As much as I love John Cena in an action movie, they are really pushing the limits of what the core audience will process. The Fast and the Furious maybe a silly action movie focus around cars but you don't make billions at the box office attempting to squeeze in plots and characters that contradict who your main character is. If you wanted to add John Cena to your ever-growing cast, they're had to been an easier way to pull if off.Man, I know it sounds like I hate this movie, but I did not, l swear. The action sequences were Steller, I loved the little moments they allowed the character Ramsey to have and they continue to honor the legacy of the late Paul Walker in this movie, but more than any of the other films you can tell this was all about making money. I can't tell were Fast 9 ranks among the 10 (if you include Hobbs and Shaw which was better than this film) Fast movies just yet, but it's on the lower half. Sorry to say one of the greatest Franchises in movie history may have to put this car in park.",F9 - The Fast Saga
25,DarkVulcan29,This franchise is running out of gas.,3,29 June 2021,"Now I know the suspension of disbelief can go on a high note with this film series, but F9 goes into a level of cartoonish, I mean you have a car that gets shot into space. I always had a sense of fun with the series, but I was not having that here. Has the film went on I was losing interest on the gangs mission.John Cena does ok has Dom's younger brother Jakob, who is the bad guy, but very little is done with his character. And if you're expecting an awesome showdown between Vin Diesel and John Cena, you will be disappointed , it ends before it starts. Charlize Theron reprises her role, but she is wasted here, her scenes look like they where filmed in one day. Vin Diesel looks like he is sleep walking through this, I just see no interest in his acting. There is also plot point in this film, that just brings the movie down.Now there are good moments in this movie, we get an good look into Dom's past, some chase scenes are watchable, and some humorous moments give a little chuckle.

26,stevendbeard,Entertaining Fable,8,26 June 2021,"I saw ""F9:The Fast Saga"", starring Vin Diesel-Bloodshot, The Pacifier; John Cena-Playing With Fire, Trainwreck; Charlize Theron-Bombshell, Hancock and Thue Ersted Rasmussen-Sunday_tv, The Way to Mandolay.This is the 9th in the series and while it's not always mandatory to see the previous entry in this series before seeing the newest installment, it would be a good idea to have seen the last one-2017's 'The Fate of the Furious'-before seeing this one because this one has the return of Charlize, plus a couple of new villains to add to the mix. Thue is a rich playboy that wants to rule the world by hiring the best money can buy to help him do so. He gets Charlize and John on board and Vin and his crew try their best to stop them. This movie-like most of the rest in the series-is like an entertaining fable. You won't be bored but you might as well throw logic out the window. There are magnets that attract and repel-I don't remember much from my school days but I don't think they can repel-and Vin must have all his cars made out of vibranium with all the punishment they can take, and still be able to drive and do more stunts. They even have a car make a trip into outer space, but like I said, that's not why you come to see these movies; it's to be entertained and they accomplish that in spades. There are flashbacks showing Vin growing up-and a few other things. There are cameos from people that were in previous movies, which is nice. And just as the end credits start, there is a scene that is a little teaser for the next movie-and it has a cameo in it, too-but there is nothing at the very end of the credits.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, action and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 25 minutes.I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",F9 - The Fast Saga

28,alindsay-al,A Below Average Explosion Fest,4,27 June 2021,"After a really long delay, the time has finally come for the new Fast & Furious film to hit cinemas and today I saw the 9th film in the main franchise and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees the crew bought back into the action when Dom's brother Jakob comes after them hunting for a device to take over.Main Character
Vin diesel has become the poster child for the fast and furious and it feels like he could play Dom Toretto in his sleep and he does that here. He is functional but uninspiring, it feels like he sleepwalks through the film, just doing about enough but not pushing himself at all to raise his standards and that is kind of how this whole film feels and he is a large part of that.Supporting Characters
The cast look like they are having some fun with the roles, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster & Nathalie Emmanuel are all decent in their roles and provide some exciting and fun moments. Even though its a small role one of the best parts of the film is seeing Charlize Theron back as Cipher and Theron does a great job and it makes me wish she was a larger part of this film. Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson are back in their roles and there are occasional funny banter between the two but they just became to much for me and transitioned from entertaining and funny and became truly annoying. John Cena plays Jakob and they really tried to make me care about his character but it just didn't really work, the flashbacks try but he is just a bland villain and does nothing to stand out. The issue is that Cipher is in the background and it makes me wish she had been the main villain of the film instead of Jakob which is a large issue. Sung Kang makes his big return as Han and it let me down, all these years there has been this campaign for him to be bought back and the way they explain that doesn't really make sense and Han is such a small part of the film that it makes you wonder why they even bothered with it.Story
The story doesn't work, Fast and Furious has always struggled with its plot but this is one of the weakest yet. There are the flashbacks that try and build the relationship between Dom and Jakob but it doesn't work and I think that is because the film gets bogged down with too much going on. Over the years the franchise has become more and more absurd with this one being the most crazy to date and it just doesn't work at all. Bringing Han back and the absurd maguffin device that is there just to drive the plot forward back just feels really contrived with a generic ending that feels like it truly lacks effort.Script
The script is also pretty bad but it really knows it and plays it up. Some of the humour had me chuckling for sure and when on screen the flashbacks do bring some heart, but it is just not enough. Overall, the drama falls flat and the humour becomes so contrived and basically addresses the stupidity of the whole franchise which doesn't work as well as some other films have done before.Style
It is crazy to see how the Fast and Furious franchise started and how it looks now. Cars explode and things explode everywhere, the film doesn't obey the laws of physics and is just there to see absurd action scenes that sees people survive things that they should never ever survive. But there comes a time when those things don't matter because none of the characters seem to be in any real danger so it is just explosions for the sake of explosions. Also the film is way too long, it is nearly 2 and a half hours and it has no right to be that way at all.Overall
Overall, Fast and Furious 9 is a below average film. It seems like this franchise is hitting the end of the road and Fast 9 is just a film where things explode and not much else so give this one a skip unless you are a huge fan of the franchise.",F9 - The Fast Saga

The other problem is the emergence of Toretto's long forgotten brother, played by series newbie John Cena, which is backfilled in numerous flashbacks (maybe too many!) & turns out not to be the most incredulous fact the films are asking us to swallow. Not going into the minutiae of the plot, all the actors are back (the trio from Tokyo Drift are back: Lucas Black, Jason Tobin (an old school Justin Lin guy going back to his feature debut Better Luck Tomorrow along w/Sung Kang) & Bow Wow (who looks like ate too many of his namesake) looking more like Bow Whoa) w/Kang coming back into the mix (in a complex, 'making it up' as we go along fashion!) so that the entire entourage can come together at film's end in an extended chase sequence where an armored vehicle needs to be stopped before the device is activated by pseudo European villains & Charlize Theron (in a haircut which my viewing mate called Moe-esque). Not as bad as the ridiculous Hobbs & Shaw but the one component missing from this new film is stalwart scribe Chris Morgan (who has written all the films from Drift on) which needed a little more of his realistic pruning (Lin had co-writer credit here when usually his ideas involve the action set pieces which, according to his audio commentaries, he comes up w/before a script is drafted) & also the notion of 'loss' gets deluded every time an old character, who was killed off, keeps coming back because fans demand it (really!

We get a look into the two brothers' past together and learn a little bit about their history racing cars.This movie has tons of action sequences with racing stunts never before seen. The characters do things with their cars that are out of this world, like for example, flying a car to space. How crazy is that? This film is packed with so many good actors such as Vin Diesel, John Cena, Michelle Rodriguez, Charlize Theron, Ludacris, Helen Mirren, Michael Rooker and special guests, Cardie B, Bad Bunny and Bow Wow. My favorite is Tyrese Gibson who adds so many comical scenes to this movie. The graphics are amazing. The cars are super expensive sports cars and supercharged muscle cars. The film takes place in different places all over the world.The moral of F9: The Fast Saga is that family is everything. Siblings can become rivals, but blood is thicker than water.

42,Abdulxoxo,Good as per the franchise's standards,7,26 June 2021,"Anyone who has followed the 'Fast and Furious' franchise from the 5th film onwards will know how preposterous they have become. If you expect the ninth instalment to be anything other than a big dumb action movie then you would be mistaken. The triumph of this film though is how knowing it is in the way it just embraces its absurdity. The action sequences in this movie are off the charts, there were some stunts and chases which were literally jaw dropping. Of course many of them made no sense whatsoever. This is certainly one of those films where you need to suspend disbelief. But the execution of these sequences was so good that you couldn't help but just roll with them and enjoy them for what they were. There are also plenty of comedic moments, particularly from Roman. Overall, The key to enjoying this movie is to go in already knowing that it has a weak narrative, a feeble script and outrageously unbelievable action sequences. What this movie offers instead is pure, unadulterated, adrenaline fuelled entertainment.",F9 - The Fast Saga
43,arungeorge13,Couldn't get myself to like this one! [+43%],4,30 July 2021,"The Fast films have stopped making sense for a pretty long time now. What we watch them for is pure popcorn entertainment. Even on that level, F9 fails to deliver. Justin Lin, the director who basically revived the franchise, strikes that very sensitive action film nerve with a totally bonkers (not in a good way!) instalment that stretches the plot and its protagonists way too thin. When Tej and Roman have discussions of the team possibly being invincible, it's not funny even in a meta-referential way because the series has run dry. I've gotten tired of saying ""no effing way!"" every time the team pulls off some ludicrous stunt or the other. I don't care about them as much because they're already superheroes without the suits or the cool names. The space set piece was just taking it one step too far.And with zero things to worry about, the set-pieces wear out their atrocious welcome rather too quickly. Dom and his crew go about doing business as usual, with the addition of Jakob (John Cena, minus his usual charisma or screen presence) into the mix. The Helen Mirren cameo got me smiling, but the Cardi B one did just the opposite. The flashback scenes also added nothing to the overall proceedings, with Jakob coming across as a poorly written character overall. Han's return also adds nothing but whatever. While F9 didn't put me to sleep, it never got my adrenaline pumping like some of the other entries did. The only scene that got me to sit up was when they teased Brian (at the very end!). Looks like we've got more precious sequel-money on the way, with that mid-credits scene.",F9 - The Fast Saga

46,Holt344,"F9 has Justin Lin back in the director chair and his direction needs praise, the action sequences were unsatisfying and unrealistic but still a truly entertaining film",6,16 July 2021,"Justin Lin returns to the Fast Saga with F9 or Fast and Furious 9, it's also the first time he have co-written a script and it was Daniel Casey who helped pen the screenplay. F9 is a continuation of the whole Saga but notably a direct sequel to The Fate and the Furious in how the spy subgenre is in the spotlight. The writing were actually pretty good and great that they keep continuity after 20 years. That's right, the franchise is that old. Justin Lin's direction was one of the highlights, simply fantastic. Dialogue was cheesy, yes. But I liked the dialogue a lot, mostly because of the actors execution is perfect. Justin Lin knows these characters so well, and so does the actors.F9 stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Helen Mirren, Kurt Russell and Charlize Theron. In the film, Dominic Toretto and the team come together to stop a world-shattering plot headed by Toretto's brother, Jakob. New characters that gets introduced are obviously John Cena as Jakob but other actors are Michael Rooker and Anna Sawai. Jakob Torreto is actually a really nice addition to the cast, I can't wait to see more of him. In smaller roles there's Lucas Black, Don Omar and Shea Whigham who reprise their respective roles as Sean Boswell, Santos and Agent Stasiak from previous films, while Shad Moss and Jason Tobin also reprise their roles. Seeing characters return in small or big roles is one of many things I love about this franchise, you get the sense that it's a whole universe, and there's also so many likeable characters so it's important for us to see them.I will be completely honest here, the action with the magnets didn't work for me, the first action sequence was great though. It wasn't very entertaining but I hope it worked for some. Critics said that the film was unrealistic and I agree with that, the magnet stuff and the space sequence is silly and unrealistic but come on this is Fast and Furious, it's a franchise that breaks physics and has a single goal and it's to top the action and entertain us which Justin Lin did with F9. The space sequence worked for me because of Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson and the chemistry they share, and their characters works so damn well together. From 2Fast2Furious, their chemistry and banter have put a smile on my face and those two were the right choice to put up in space.What I'm grateful for is how Justin Lin made the film more character driven and how the writers and producers decided to show the backstory of Dominic and Jake's father and his death, it did hurt the pacing but for fans like myself, it left me satisfied and I kinda want a standalone racing movie with J. D Pardo as Jack Torreto as that would mean going back to basics and racing movies now days are quite popular simply look at Ford V Ferrari. But overall, F9 is a good Fast and Furious movie but for an outsider who haven't seen any other films in the Fast Saga I can't really recommend this film as there's so much story and character arcs in this 9 films and it's tied up so nicely. Justin Lin will be directing the two final installments and I seriously can't wait to see what they have in store for us, but I really hope they go back to basics with more practical stunts.",F9 - The Fast Saga
47,Hollywood_Yoda,Outrageous and Odd,7,24 September 2021,"The fact that the film loses Dwayne Johnson is quite the setback, as he and Diesel led the cast for years in previous entries. Adding John Cena as another Toretto brother so late in the storyline also makes little sense as he's obviously never mentioned ever before. The saga of Fast & Furious is starting to seem like a racing/heist daytime soap opera.The story is outrageous, in the fact that two characters are launched into outer space in a car! Come on, now, really? However, the magnet cars storyline was pretty interesting. It was also great to see that Justin Lin was back in the director's chair. Fast & Furious 9 could have been better, but it lacks the best writers. The early films of the franchise were better thought out and directed.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Also, I definitely miss Dwayne Johnson's Hobbs character, in this movie. The visual effects are fantastic. Vin Diesel is superb as Dominic Toretto. Michelle Rodriguez is excellent as Letty. Jordana Brewster is brilliant as Mia. Tyrese Gibson is hilarious as Roman. Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges is great as Tej. Nathalie Emmanuel is amazing as Ramsey.

49,bankofmarquis,Enjoyable...enough,7,24 July 2021,"If you have any interest in checking out F9:THE FAST SAGA, then you have seen at least 1 (if not more) of the other 9 films in this series - and you pretty much know what to expect.And this film delivers on that expectation - no more, no less.Director Justin Lin - a veteran of these films - knows what needs to happen in this series. So we get fast cars, macho men, kick-ass women, super villains and over-the-top stunts and situations. All brought to us with a wink and a shrug. Unapologetic about the absurdities that we are viewing (not to spoil, but I don't think magnets really work the way they work in this film) and ""upping the ante"" at every turn.This film largely delivers...if not spectacularly. The action sequences (which is really why we watch these films) are ""good enough"". Nothing really new here, but I caught myself cackling at the events on the screen from time to time.The ""family"" is back together and Vin Diesel & Michelle Rodriguez are the pseudo Mom and Dad of this ragtag group of heroes that include the smart one (Game Of Thrones' Nathalie Emanuel) and the wise guys (Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges and Tyrese Gibson) - who know exactly what type of film they are making and what their roles in this film are as well as the ""emotional center"", Jordana Brewster. All of these deliver their wooden lines with gritty resolve while clenching their jaws during their close-ups during the action scenes.There also is a boatload of cameos from veterans of previous Fast and Furious films from the likes of Kurt Russell, Helen Mirren, Lucas Black, Shea Wigham and Charlize Theron as well as brief appearances by ""newcomers"" like Michael Rooker and Cardi B. They all join in on the fun at the appropriate level and look like they are having a good time.The biggest disappointment for me was John Cena as the main villain in this piece. He just wasn't ""villainous"" enough and came off pretty generic and ""meh"" - never a good thing for a bad guy in these types of films.Oh...and there is a ""surprise return"" by a presumably thought dead character, that is no surprise at all, since his face is shown prominently in the advertisements for this film. I won't spoil it for you here, but he does bring some needed energy to this film. Which leads me to speculate that Gal Gadot will probably show up in the next film (her character was killed off many Fast and Furious films ago when she started becoming a SuperStar).Ultimately, what is missing from F9 is some ""fun energy"". Something that...oh...a good villain...or someone like...Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson would bring. But, alas, ""The Rock"" and Vin Diesel did not get along in their previous outings together, so we will need to limp along with what we have.Which is what the 10th film in this Universe ultimately does - limp along just good enough to be enjoyable, but not more than that, which makes F9 neither Fast nor Furious.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",F9 - The Fast Saga

A car in space! Taking it just that little too far!

52,abisio,We wait two years for this ?,3,9 July 2021,"Fast and the Furious was remake of Point Break; a far better movie but without car chases (only surf and skydiving) so it was not a big success.2F2F was a better movie and incorporated Tyrese Gibson one of the biggest assets of the series after the late Paul Walker.Tokyo Drift had nothing to do with the series; only a Vin Diesel cameo at the end and introduced a couple of characters.The fourth instalment, other than the return or Diesel and Walker was a good but not memorable action movie.It was on the fifth heavy mayhem was introduced plus the Rock and the movie become a global sensation.Sadly, Walker's absence after the 7th part leave a hole very difficult to fill up.The 8th movie centered around saintly Diesel's history was a complete let down. Charlize Theron as the bad woman, and some very spectacular action scenes compensated somewhat.Now comes 9th part again around Diesel's family conflicts; however what in the 8th could be somewhat believable; this time is totally absurd and the resolution is frankly stupid and uncompromised.Yes, the worse part of this movie is not the car going to outer space to crash a satellite; the real problems here are:
Lack of good action scenes (the electromagnet is almost every car chase).The absurdity of a car jumping on a rope like Tarzan without a minimum sense of physics or gravityThe too long dramatic scenes of young Toretto (luckily the guy is better actor than Diesel and able to sustain the long and boring scenes).And above all the stupid writing that does not make any sense. Bad characters are betrayed and become good in 5 minutes. Or a conflict that does not justify anything like driving a two wagon trunk in the middle of the city or catching a car from a stealth jet.Tyrese Gibson is the only actor / character worth seeing; the rest; even the charismatic Han are underwritten. Even Michelle Rodriguez a decent actress is tied up to an empty character.In brief; perhaps somebody read this and get a better writer and perhaps a different director; but do not waste your time with F9.

53,bob-the-movie-man,Magnetic BS that will no doubt attract Fast-fans,4,24 June 2021,"Positives:
Glossy locations, fast cars and beautiful women: the usual Fast stuff.When the stunts are ""real"", they are good and exciting. But it's often difficult to tell when there's been a 'computer-assist'.Negatives:
I complained in my review for ""The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" about it having a childish and ludicrous plot. This movie makes that look like bl***y Shakespeare! There's an attempt to add a smidgen of family tension into the mix, based on Dom's childhood trauma. But aside from that element, the 'story' (I use the term in its loosest possible sense) bounces (without any rational logic most of the time) from ludicrous situation to ludicrous situation without pause. Most of these are linked by Ramsey (the very British Nathalie Emmanuel) stating a random fact such as ""Well, now he's going to need to launch a satellite"". And off we go again. (That particular crazy story arc even sees them 'doing a Musk' and flying a car into space: I kid you not!)It's not even the 'big stuff' that's unbelievable. Everywhere you look, there are inconsistencies and things that don't make sense.-- Tej (played by Ludicris - an appropriate name here) takes dodging a brigade worth of machine gun bullets to nonsensical limits.-- Generally, the cast gets blasted, dropped, crashed, burned, and otherwise put through more fatal situations than you can imagine, only to walk out without a scratch.-- And if you can show me a single delivery lorry in Edinburgh that has an automatic gearbox, I'll be amazed!At one point, Roman (Tyrese Gibson) mutters some line about ""Trusting in the physics and the numbers"". Well, let me tell you, it's like no physics that I studied on this planet. A lot of the set pieces involve huge magnets attached to trucks and cars. Now - correct me if I'm wrong - but if you turn a massive magnet on in a truck then as well as ripping the car you are chasing through the adjacent building (as if), you will also force the truck to be pulled into that building too. OK, perhaps not as much.... but the lorry ain't going to stay in its driving lane, I know that much! And magnets attract metal - they don't repel it!At 145 minutes, this is well over 2 hours of my life I will never get back.Summary Thoughts on ""F9"": It's just such a formulaic and contrived piece of fluff that it makes me cross that they can spend $200,000 on a movie and not make it better. Part of this involves the lazy use of CGI to create obviously nonsensical stunts that devalue true action films. Yes, the stunt team was busy, and impressive, here - but always going for ""one better"" has led to extensive use of CGI. That's why I liked the 2014 'knock-off' film ""Need for Speed"" - - at least they did all their stunts old-school, in camera, and not in the computer.But whatever I say here, this movie will unfortunately get its audience. At the time of writing, it's already made nearly $300K at the box office on its $200K budget. Which means there will inevitably be an F10, no doubt involving a driving battle on the planet Mars. Sigh.By the way, before you dive for the exits to relieve your bladder (it is 145 minutes after all), there is a mid-credits scene that re-introduces an old favourite.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

56,kjproulx,It's Starting to Lose What Made it Fun in the First Place,5,16 July 2021,"I have been a fan of the Fast & Furious franchise since the release of the original film in 2001. I enjoyed 2 Fast 2 Furious and The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, but it seemed like the franchise had more than fizzled out at that point. In 2009 the series made a comeback with the original cast and again I was back on board. I like these characters and will always watch a new film with them all in it. After the fourth installment, everyone knows how the series took off. Five and Six are easily the best two films in the franchise, but then again, losing Paul Walker seemed to drain it all once again. This series has been a roller coaster for me, but I've had a blast with every installment to varying degrees. F9 is now in theatres, and sadly, this was the first film in the franchise (although still enjoyable) that I'm very torn on. Here is why I believe this is the weakest in the franchise.This franchise began with illegal street racing and now they're basically superheroes without calling themselves that. F9 begins with the team needing to track down Cipher (Charlize Theron) once again, but Dom (Vin Diesel) soon realizes that his younger brother Jakob (John Cena) is working with her. Having devised a plot that will in turn cause global destruction, the team must find a way to disarm a satellite in space. On top of that, the film brings Han back (Sung Kang) back as one of the main characters and the action is more than over the top. It's hard for me to describe this movie without wanting to chuckle.What I admired about this film is that it wanted to expand on Dom's backstory and we receive many flashbacks to younger versions of these characters. The fact that Dom's speech from the first film now has some visual context was kind of nice. Tej (Ludacris) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) are once again enjoyable when they are teamed up, but their subplot here was pretty much the end of the very long line this franchise has been stretching. To say the very least, this film just goes way too far. John Cena is fine as Dom's brother, but the fact that it took nine movies to introduce the brother of your main character, made me not care. Fast & Furious has basically become a high-action soap opera and it has worked every time until now. Again, this is coming from someone who loves this franchise.It goes without saying that the laws of physics being played with are what made these films so much fun. Pulling bank vaults down the street, tugging a plane out of the sky, and battling a Submarine on ice were all basically not possible in reality, but they still found a way to keep the story grounded and not quite push it too far. This time, not just one, but every single action scene deals with moments that could never physically happen and these people are all human. They poke fun at the fact that they never get injured or die, but that isn't enough when looking at just how dumb the action is here. From street racers to superheroes, the Fast & Furious franchise is now running on fumes for me, even though I'll be there for the two-part finale they're planning.Overall, F9 is a fun movie to watch on the big screen, but only if you're able to completely suspend all of your disbelief. If it wasn't for these characters all being enjoyable, I probably would've hated this film. What the most puzzling thing to me is, is the fact that Justin Lin came back to direct and will be doing the next two films as well. He is the one who probably understands this franchise the most and easily made it what it became in Fast Five and Furious 6, but it's almost like he's taking too many notes from the ridiculous suggestions on the internet. F9 is the movie everyone joked about when Fast Five was in theatres, but I don't mean that in a good way. Even if you're a huge fan of the franchise, I can't see many people loving this one. F9 is now playing in theatres, however, waiting to rent it is just fine.",F9 - The Fast Saga
57,Movi3DO,Still fun. Let's see how they would outdo this,7,28 June 2021,"As long as we obey the law of physics, we'll be fine. The numbers don't lie.Ludacris actually said that. No joke. F8 required a good amount of suspension of disbelief, but this one pushed the level of suspension into space. People were legit bouncing around, getting hit, thrown through walls, and none of them had any mildly serious injuries. However, I still enjoyed the ridiculousness and blatant defiance of the natural law.In the same old FF fashion, cars were destroyed, but this time, also pulled and repelled my magnets left and right. The car chases were still the best part. The final action scene was awesome with long chases. People, normal and armored cars got thrown like mayhem.The main villain was still trash like in previous FF, but the relationship between Jacob, played by Mr. You Can't See Me, and Dom had potential to be investing. However, it still became good old cliche family stuff. Han coming back was meh. He didn't do much, and the movie would be the same without him.I had one thing to say about Charlize Theron's character. She looked great as usual, but that bowl cut hair was just hilarious. Her character was the same thing as in F8.Overall, it wasn't as fun as F8 even though there were more crazy stunts.

Justin Lin ignores the little balance that the saga still possesses in previous installments, delivering insanely dumb moments throughout entire set pieces, contrary to having a somewhat acceptable action scene with the occasional suspension of disbelief in a specific situation. Daniel Casey and Lin are also unable to create a compelling narrative around Dom's lost brother, ultimately damaging years of character development for Vin Diesel's role. Bringing back Han was as unnecessary as the unconvincing explanation for his return, hurting not only this movie's pacing and extended runtime but also the emotional weight of previous films. The original cast members and the exceptional production value are enough to save this installment from being a massive disaster. If you're able to (really) shut down your brain for over two hours, this might still be an entertaining time at the theater.

What started as an elementary concept fixated on Cars & Racing, slowly turned into Action Extravaganza throughout these years. And the trend persists and it will until & unless they decide to put an end to all of this. Which isn't likely to happen anytime soon!Customary physics-defying Action, same old cheesy Performances, a similar mushy melodrama about family; broadly speaking, the template of these movies has become so predictable now that there's actually no room for surprises! People already figured out what's in the offing and you know what? The majority of them don't bat an eyelid anymore.Talking of F9, the narrative layout is precisely the same! Dom living in peace > approached by some agency to do some unimaginable stuff > Thereafter he amasses the entire crew > Lots of Fights, Car Chases, Explosions take place > Successfully carrying out the Mission by triumphing over the bad guys > Sort of a Happy Ending I guess?Aargh! Can you not go down the same road every freaking time, please?Make no mistake, I'm not opposed to repeating resembling concepts many times over nor do I have any issues with the actors reprising their roles for the hundredth time; provided that they bring some much-needed creativity into the process. Which, they are so reluctant to by the way!Nevertheless, the technical sides are yet again extremely impressive; perhaps the only thing that is entitled to some much-deserved accolades. Whether it be the grandness of the Cinematography or the indefatigable Score; things have been tight in this regard.The amount of hard work and Perseverance put into all those Action pieces is commendable and there's no denying it but be warned, they do not comply with any kind of Logic or Justification. So my word of advice would be to just suspend your disbelief, and you will be good to go.When it comes to Performances or for that matter the Script; there's not much to talk about. In the former times, these things were accustomed to having utmost importance; that is no longer the case! Matter of fact, F9 appears to be more like an Action Montage with Characters and the Plot being nothing but expository tools. I believe, the writers needed something to bridge the gaps and they eventually managed to find a reasonable way out.",F9 - The Fast Saga
65,0w0,"200 million dollars, and this TERRIBLE movie is the result",4,10 August 2021,"This is EASILY the worst 'fast and furious' movie yet.... EASILY....This movie is laughably bad and EASILY the most unrealistic movie that I've ever watched. It's so unrealistic, that you'd swear the director of the movie was a 7 year old boy, and the script was written with crayons.Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. Go watch a more realistic movie, like Starship Troopers or something.",F9 - The Fast Saga
66,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,25 June 2021,"Something obvious in theory but surprising when it materializes in practice: no American blockbuster today is immune to being influenced by the success of Marvel and its formula. This happens in The Fast and the Furious 9. It's an influence that is felt in the film in many ways. And it happens first of all because, just like in the MCU, the Velozes franchise has offered the same film over the years as if it were new - and it always needs to renew the public's expectation around it.The MCU retains its base by offering - as the comics have always taught - a continuity that promises itself minimally tied, film to film, and a central part of the pleasure of viewers and fans is precisely having their accumulated knowledge taken care of in this service. What Fast and Furious 9 has to give is not very different from an Avengers Ultimatum: a non-linear plot that goes from the present to the past, establishing relationships that convert into fan service, and that exist as a result.This time, we're going to the past not only to meet Dom's brother (Vin Diesel) that no one knew existed, played by newcomer John Cena. A continuity fix also involves reshooting a scene from The Fast and the Furious 6 to allow Sung Kang to return as Han. Likewise, you need to know the Fast and the Furious 3 to fully understand who Sean, Twinkie and Earl are, the trio that now promises to tune the Fast into outer space.In other words, after 20 years, in which the fast-paced cracks and slashes franchise has reinvented itself as a spectacle of international intrigue, The Fast and the Furious begins - like a physics lab experiment - to shrink after its spectacular expansion. This shrinkage doesn't happen on the scale of action (the scale even gets bigger after the Arctic submarine adventure in the eighth film), but on the very way Speedy deals with himself: in the characters' relationships, self-reference has become the rule .This can be boring or rewarding, depending on how the viewer relates to the franchise. At the same time that it unfolds as chases defined by cause and effect, the plot of Fast 9 is a succession of encounters, and in these scenes there is essentially nothing that ""happens"".Dom and Magdalene Shaw (Helen Mirren) cross paths in London? There is a brief exposition dialogue to justify the scene, but in practice it only exists for the pleasure of seeing them together. In other words, Fast and Furious becomes, to a large extent, a great get-together, like the obligatory sunny lunch that closes the films and always underlines the episodic character of the franchise.For those who understand that the biggest fan service is not knowing news about Dom's family, but the pyrotechnic action that defies physics, Fast 9 probes new CGI limits for the series, and the ""marvelization"" in this case happens so much in the beating scenes (Diesel and John Cena hit each other like superheroes, punching through walls) and in chases, with cars flying and jumping like real rubber action figures.As it would be no different, for the public to accept the agreement with these new levels of the improbable, it is necessary to place within the film an external commentator who accuses its own improbability. That's where the characters of Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson come in, who in addition to starring in the best scene in the film (Alfonso Cuarón crawled into orbit so that Velozes could fly) lend themselves to observers (not to mention the stereotype of the minstrel, the irreverent black) , questioning the limits of the film and this absurd accumulation of situations in which the franchise was built. The wear and tear of the formula is felt within the scene.It's not all that different - just for the MCU comparison - from Marvel's comic reliefs made to disarm seriousness or to sow via metalanguage (it's been almost ten years since we found out that Agent Coulson collected Captain America cards) the territory of self-reference and self-indulgence. What we will discover, in the films that remain in the future of the series, is whether in these last movements of Fast, self-reference will be enough to continue holding attention.I liked this review from the Omelete websiteFilm viewed on June 24, 2021.",F9 - The Fast Saga
67,TheTruthofItIs,Director Lin crushingly disappoints in F9,2,12 September 2021,"How does veteran F&F director Justin Lin go so far off the rails with F9?! We called time-of-death at 20-mins, it was cartoonish in it's over-the-top action with no consequences. Are our protags super-heroes now?! They blow through mine fields, dodge automatic gunfire and missile-firing helicopter gunships with NOT SO MUCH AS A SCRATCH! At this point they all should've suffered broken bones, concussions, lacerations, etc but not - one - scratch. And Dom's trademark gleaming white t-shirt - not marked one bit. Seriously, he must don (pun intended!) a new t-shirt every - single - scene. There's no point in watching anything like this since you know the protags are absolutely invincible - ala superheroes, and that's NOT what the F&F franchise has been about. Guess they feel the pressure from the Marvel studios, but it makes for a disappointingly poor film, and that's why you see 1 and 2 star reviews here 5X more than 9 and 10.",F9 - The Fast Saga
68,cardsrock,Getting to be exhausting,6,2 August 2021,"I'm someone who's continued enjoy these films even as they've increasingly gone off the rails. F9 is where I think I've reached my breaking point.The stunts aren't even crazy anymore, they're just stupid. It's gotten impossible to care about what's happening because anyone who dies comes back to life. There are no stakes. They're also basically superheroes at this point, which they even reference in the film.The magnets. My god the magnets. I don't even know what to say other than the logic and consistency of how the magnets work is flabbergasting.This isn't to say everything is bad. Cena is a fun villain, even though the flashback scenes for his character are cringe. The music is still great. Lin's direction is solid. The themes still resonate, but are becoming increasingly meme-able.I feel like a 6 is generous here and is mostly based on my previous enjoyment of this franchise. I hope this series can course correct or find a good ending because they're throttling towards a cliff.",F9 - The Fast Saga
69,rdoubleoc,Let me help Hollywood out...,5,21 August 2021,"I'm gonna do Hollywood a solid, and save them millions in intelligence gathering:The original fast and furious was good. Even the first few after that weren't bad. However, they were never as good as the original, or as good as people thought. Not every good movie needs to be made into a franchise.Why did everyone seem so gung-ho about the franchise, then? The same reason ""everyone"" liked Lord of the Rings and Games of Thrones even though they never talk about it anymore -- they were just saying that because they thought it was bad not to. Ever have a friend who told another person they like something that you liked, when they never even saw or read it? Yeah --- some people have to fabricate their lives, including what they like.If someone says they like something, ask why they like it. YOU'LL BE SURPRISED at how full of CRAP people are, and movie reviews are no different. I bet a lot of critics don't even watch the movie. Who's going to tell them they didn't? Is there a test at the end, like in English class?Hollywood needs better metrics on what people actually like. Or we would have ended up with a bunch of movies that are barely watchable. ""Watchable"" is the key word here, also.""Watchable"" and ""fake people"" are key terms Hollywood needs to learn, IMO.",F9 - The Fast Saga
70,ronakkotian,This is too much!,2,30 June 2021,"The Fast & Furious franchise is one of the biggest franchises to exist. I've been following it since the fifth one but now it's gotten to a point where it's become too much.F9: The Fast Saga continues the Fast & Furious franchise as Cipher enlists the help of Jakob, Dom's brother, to get revenge on Dom and his team.What this series has become since the first in unimaginable and F9 is one of the worst entries in the franchise. Justin Lin has made majority of the Fast & Furious films with Fast Five being my favourite. It's nice to see him return and he knows how to direct large action set pieces really well. The action sequences in F9 are absolutely ridiculous. They may be cool to look at but my brain couldn't handle how illogical they all were. These films may as well be science fiction at this point. Characters get thrown around, break through firm materials and even manage to get caught by cars with no injuries whatsoever. We see a man's head break through a metal street sign and he acts as if nothing happened. In a similar scene, we see another person's head smash through and break a door frame with no injury or concussion of the slightest. There are points where the film tries to make you believe one of the members of the team will die but I felt no tension because I know there's going to be a sequel in the future. The action is so insane that it's become laughable at this point.Aside from the final action sequence and the opening, the rest of the film is pretty dull. This film is 2 hour 20 minutes long and it really didn't need to be. The explanation of Han surviving wasn't believable at all, the actual confrontation between Dom and Jakob after witnessing their strained relationship through the flashbacks was so weak and short and the ending was some of the most predictable stuff I've seen. I could see it coming a mile away.This series is somewhat of a joke now. It seems like the main objective is to outdo the previous installment, forgetting about characterisation and the story. I can see people being thoroughly entertained by the action but for me, there's a line where it becomes too much and F9 crossed it. I cannot imagine how ridiculous and over-the-top Fast & Furious 10 will be.",F9 - The Fast Saga
71,Stanlee107,Fast and I'm furious,3,1 August 2021,I went in with an opened mind but somehow I was still disappointed?! They got rid of Dwayne Johnson (the Rock) & sidelined Jason Statham whose chemistry made this very watchable. They replaced them with John Cena & try as he can... He pales by comparison given that he played his role very straight. Try better if this Franchise gets another sequel!,F9 - The Fast Saga

74,sbweightman,"More of the same, but it's definitely lost its way.",3,26 June 2021,"The plot is over the top, the action scenes are spectacular and the stunts are destructive, but it gets too bogged down in its narrative, spending far too much time on the family drama side of things. There are loads of story strands and throwaway characters brought in for their pieces, which do create some funny moments, but overall, make the movie dull and drag on. The stunts are also often a step too far and come across silly and illogical, which doesn't fit with the more serious setting, and Diesel's flat emotional range makes his scenes painful to watch. The villains were great and the action scenes were fast and furious, but as a franchise, it's definitely lost its way.",F9 - The Fast Saga
75,lareval,Worst Fast Movie,1,27 August 2021,"I have tolerated the movies of this franchise as what they are: mindless fun and escapist entertainment.

What about the space stuff? What about the...? Ah, yeah. This has no plot whatsoever. Complete, utter rubbish.",F9 - The Fast Saga
76,ethanbresnett,Delivers everything you could ask for from a Fast movie,7,29 June 2021,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, the Fast franchise really knows its audience and leans into its ludicrous nature and self satire in such glorious fashion that its hard not to have a ball watching these films.Undoubtedly Fast 9 is the weaker of the latest instalments, in terms of plot, character, dialogue, but there was no expense spared on the action and the stunts, which is the main attraction after all. The whole film was just pure unadulterated fun.Does any of it make sense? No. Is the action insanely ridiculous? Of course. Should they all have died numerous times over before the film even hits the 20 minute mark? Absolutely. But if you are sat there rolling your eyes at the stunts then that's a you problem not a problem with the film. You need to suspend your disbelief to its fullest extent, turn off the logic switch in your brain and kick back and have a good time.I say suspend your disbelief because the stunts are more ridiculous than they've ever been in the franchise. They really excelled themselves with this one and should be applauded for that. I also like how self aware they are that what they are doing is insane. It's all presented as serious in the film but you do get the sense that the director is winking at the audience thinking ""yeah, we actually just did that"".Of course this film has its numerous flaws. I think the weakest point, as with most of the Fast films, is the plot. It was full of far too many flashback scenes which could have been condensed and which didn't add as much to the character development as was intended. The plot is pretty run of the mill, as our protagonists unite to track down a MacGuffin and drive their way to saving the world. Its all stupid and silly but the plot takes a back seat in these films so who cares?John Cena was a nice addition to the Fast family, and I'm hoping this means that we could see him square off with The Rock in a Fast film in the near future. Surely there has to be some thinly veiled wrestling references on the horizon? He was a pretty one dimensional character but was interesting enough to hold his own against the established cast.If you've enjoyed the previous 8 (9 included the spin off) instalments of the Fast franchise there's no way you'll come out of this disappointed. I had an absolute blast and seeing this in IMAX was quite a treat.",F9 - The Fast Saga
77,nikola17,Only way you can enjoy this movie is not to take this movie seriously anymore you just enjoy it for fun,9,6 September 2021,"I saw this film back in theatre back in May, but all sudden I have been taking breaks from writing movie review's. And yes I didn't hate this movie at all F&F franchise hasn't been taking it too seriously anymore since 5th film Fast Five hasn't been taking too seriously anymore it's gone over top witch I like that movies are escapable to get out of reality but yeah film has gone bit too far when they went to space that was too far ahead I agree it was but for me it doesn't kill movie. So what if they went to space? This movie was never about street racing anymore but you casuals keep yapping and crying about it. A lot of people are saying when it will be about racing? Never because F&F franchise has gone to different direction right now believe me it could go back the way it was before maybe but I don't believe that they gonna go to different direction just like with this movie. My only issue is with film biggest one is when they are bringing back characters from dead like Han (Sung Kang) character witch made Fast 7 now pointless doesn't make me to hate movie not kidding at all because every new F&F movies they will always set up story that includes John Cena playing Dom brother??Come on now Dominic never mention he had another brother or told him about his father death was accident because my brother killed him never was mention in first movie when he brought Brain to garage to show his Dodge charger 1979. Didn't mention nothing this back story origin story about Dominic younger brother Jakob played by John Cena where was his other brother Vincent?? That is missing part of movie where is Vincent younger brother of Vin the one who got killed off Fast Five?? Why wasn't he their in first place in origin story? That's how writers messed up. I like back story origin story of Dom past and showing his father that was played by (JD Pardo) Jack Toretto, now that actor is known for Mayans TV show surprised to see him playing Dom father. I like traditionally staff they used old classic style likeuniversal logo sign from 90's style from opening film it was original at start but they show some flashback scenes witch I liked something bit different rather then doing a prequel movie of F&F origins witch that would waste of space. Story follows In the present, two years after the confrontation against cyberterrorist Cipher that was Fate of Furious (2017) Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriquez) living in a peaceful life at a quiet place at village. Dom is retired and raising his son Brian with his Letty. Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Nathalie Emmanuel), Ramsey arrives they bring up with news that, shortly after capturing Cipher (Charlize Theron), Mr. Nobody's (Kurt Russell) character plane was attacked by rogue agents and crashed in Montequinto, Central America. Dom agrees to help them after realizing Jakob is involved that is (John Cena) later on you find it's his younger brother surprised that other brother Vincent didn't mention nothing about Jakob character in previous F&F that was confusing as F. You have Mia (Jordana Brewster) hottest chick back last time she was in F&F movie was Fast & Furious 7 witch she doesn't get to do much but in this movie she joins team she kicks ass I am like?? Since when does she kick's ass and learn how to shoot a gun? She never did it from previous F&F movies but you know movie is unrealistic and they can make characters to do anything. But it was something different for her character Mia rather then just actinglike girly who doesn't know how to fight and does that but hey you got Jordana Brewster to kick a lot of asses in movie. I thought John Cena was alright in movie but I am not biggest on John Cena as actor I use to be fan of John Cena back in WWE but then that's when he messed up industry people got tied of him when he became really famous I have nothing against John Cena him as actor his okay but I prefer Dwayne Johnson, Dave Bautista, Steve Austin but John Cena is alright actor I can handle him fine but they could just got John Cena character as villain because him as unknown brother makes so many mistakes because he never was mention in F&F movies. Bringing back Sung Kang was bad idea completely because they just made Tokyo Drift, Furious 7 just pointless their was no point of bringing back Han they just stop bringing back characters from previous F&F characters that got killed off just leave them their and make new characters that's all. Charlize Theron she is doing my head in, I am sick tied of seeing this boyish haircutstyle rubbish haircut style. Witch she looks like a butch style what's with her silly haircut looks?? I am just getting sick and tied of Charlize Theron wannabe looking like a guy, Butch haircut style. She has short Blonde hair she looks like wanna be Justin Bieber haircut type jeez would someone tell Charlize Theron to stop having Boyish haircut it doesn't even suit her it looks like one of hair dressers put a bowl on head and cut around haircut she must have bad taste of hairstyles nowadays I liked when she looked like a pretty girl and now she looks like butch. She will be other F&F movies can they just throw her off cliff bring new villain to movie. F&F is meant to unrealistic film escapable film witch I was fine with. Action scenes, new car models everything like that was great I thought action was really watchable it was fun entering never got bored out of it I fun moments tons of fun I love escapable moments movies can get away with it easy. But when they went to space was just over top silly first of all Sean (Lucas Black) and Earl (Jason Tobin) and Twinkie (Bow Wow) they were street racers now suddenly they are now engineering scientist Roman and Tej went in car that is design a rocket ship car they threw to space. That's your scene forks that's why you don't take this F&F movies anymore you just enjoy it for fun ride. If your die hard fan of F&F films. Also you have cameo people random forks like Cardi B was in it for 5 minutes, Michael Rooker like if he is playing role from Rowdy Burns from Days of Thunder, Martyn Ford was in movie as cameo, little role of Jason Statham made a cameo at end of film, Don Omar, Shea Whigham, Kurt Russell appears in film for little bit, UFC fighter Francis Ngannou You have tons of familiar faces in F9 jeez so many actors fits in 1 movie all together too many to name in list as goes on. I thought it was a fun dumb film to watch I was surprised I didn't hate it at all found it a fun movie I am die hard of F&F movies I never get sick and tied of them at all We all know the franchise has evolved, if you don't like the direction it's gone in, don't bother watching them. They're never gonna be going back to old school F&F films is about street racing, stealing VCR's they are not going back to that it's not about street racing anymore, F&F films has gone to new direction people still think oh F&Ffilms has gone to new direction now people still thinking it's not gonna be going back to old street racing films. This franchise has changed (2009) Fast and Furious 4. Action will keep you on spot doesn't get you bored at all I reckon if you love F&F films your die hard fan of it don't expect for this movie to go on seriously direction this film has changed like I said 9.10 this is one of my favourite films of this year and yes I liked this movie enough said.",F9 - The Fast Saga

However the filmmakers are also extracting the urine from the audience too. They've finally gone too far. We can't suspend our disbelief anymore. Some of the stuff that happens in this film is roll your eyes and tut levels of dumb. Indeed laws of physics do not apply.This is the ninth instalment not counting 'Hobbs and Shaw' and the franchise is tired. Worn out, ready for the car crusher!Trying to top what has gone before with even more ludicrousness to the point where the audience just switches off. None of the onscreen spectacle registers anymore. There's no tension or excitement because those onscreen are depicted as being invincible. They don't get hurt and if they die they just come back several movies later.I am a fan of the original 'Fast and Furious' believing that the franchise peaked with 'Fast Five'.Being released during the time where the pandemic has brought Cinema to its knees, COVID 19 isn't the biggest obstacle hampering the films box office potential. Sadly now the weight of this worn out franchise is too heavy for Vin Diesel's shoulders to carry by himself.Diesel's supporting cast are lacklustre to say the least. Without Dwayne Johnson, Paul Walker and Jason Statham there's a lacking of charisma. So much so that the producers have turned to John Cena as Jakob, Dom's never before mentioned younger brother to help replace a large rock shaped hole in the cast. This hasn't worked. In 'The Suicide Squad' Cena is allowed to shine. Here he gets little to do as does Charlize Theron.The most intriguing and entertaining part of the movie is the flashback scenes involving a young Dom and Jakob. This would have made a more interesting movie. Instead we get set piece after set piece of stupidness. I thought I'd tapped out with parachuting cars but this film takes it to new levels. I have actually watched more believable cartoon episodes of 'Roadrunner' than some of the tripe dreamt up in this film.F9 isn't the worst of the franchise.

Might as well have throw in a useless Kardashian! *Eye Roll* This whole movie had so many UNBELIEVABLE twists and turns it made for a total waste of 2 hours. It was neat to see Dom's son but that was about it. I will not be watching again, unless someone tell me that Jason Statham was in pr. 10 and it was at least a believable story.

Where can i begin, to be fair the movie is not as bad as they say, yes it's a little over the top but looking past those things there was some really good parts of the film that i really enjoyed. Seeing all the bad reviews i went into this thinking it was going to be the worst film I've seen this year but it does hold up in its own crazy witty kind of way. I wont go into detail about the movie but what i will say is wait a little bit after the credits as there is a little scene which i assume is for F10.I do think this is worth the watch, i wouldn't call this the greatest movie the franchise has made so with that note I'm scoring it a 5 out of 10 which is pretty low. Vin Diesel was exceptionally great in this, he hasn't lost his spark with the character Dominic Toretto and it was also good to see some characters come back, the stoey just didn't make sense and the space scene was way too far.Watch if you want, not a recommendatipn.",F9 - The Fast Saga

And as we get ""more of the same"", it becomes apparent on how shaky the scripts really are. It's still a lot of work, good choreographies and settings.. but most of the characters are now tiresome, and the dialogue is still cringey! All of it, without exception. Paired with unrealistic action (that takes you out) and CGI overuse, as well as a lack of genuine imagination to make something unconceivable.. you get something dull.Anyway,
Toretto family vs a bland rich villain with a bland side-stepped plan that we all know doesn't turn out as the bad guys expect. I'd say it's on the same level as ""Hobbs and Shaw"". It's kind of uninteresting, but you can watch it if you want. You can't really hate it, but you'd be hard pressed to be entertained. With no meaningful interactions, or that spark to give it life.. No amount of action will save the upcoming releases....

84,akshatmahajan,Overstretched and weak,5,3 August 2021,"F9 was expected to be fun and entertaining like previous parts. This one was also fun and entertaining but the movie was overstretched.The plot is senseless and characters are not that much connecting to the audience. Like previous parts, movie's writing part is weak and they all defy basic physics, but that's kinda the fun part. This part is for the audience who love action. Movie has dumber dialogue, laugh at/with it, but don't come into it expecting a masterpiece. One problem with the movie was that it was too long. They could have easily cut 30 minutes out of it.This franchise is no more like real story with real action.

F&F is known for going crazier and crazier with each entry, but I think it's gone too far for its own good. Not one action scene entertained me; none of the scenes were creative, they were just dumb. Some may find enjoyment from how ridiculous it is, but I was just left unimpressed.And the story was exactly the same as the last few F&F movies. They're so similar that you can literally predict what happens if you've recently watched F8 or F7. F&F has gone so far from it's roots that I've given up on the franchise. At least give one spin-off for the car guys and OG fans, maybe something similar to the first three F&Fs, it'll hurt nobody, Universal.This movie is just really bad. Tons of plot holes, ridiculous action scenes, and a story that disgraces what F&F used to be. As a huge and longtime fan of the franchise, I have now lost faith. This film is a disgrace, and I refuse to believe that John Cena is Dominic Toretto's brother.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Overall rating 74/100Cipher (Charleze Theron) enlists the help of Jakob (John Cena) Dom's younger brother to take revenge on Dom and his team and to retrieve a weapon that will control every single form of weapon across the globe.Despite some obvious big flaws. I had such a fun time with F9! I absolutely loved the flashbacks and character background for Dom and Jacob, it was very well done and welcome addition to the film. The cars and the racing elements were great as usual. I liked the surprising amount of emotional weight In parts. Of course the whole cast had fantastic chemistry with each other this is the 9th film after all. The film still had a great charm and theme of family at the heart of it, the franchise still does this so well. The movie was absolutely hilarious, and the action was incredibly entertaining, absolutely ridiculous and over the top but that's what I love about it. The cinematography was amazing. The performances were great especially from Charleze Theron, Michelle Rodriguez and John Cena who upped his game acting wise here. The film was very self aware which made it way more enjoyable. The character conflict was excellent. I liked the new elements they added to the film and franchise, they balanced this with some of the charm and racing from the first few films. I liked the plot twists and links between different storylines, the explanation into certain characters was well done. The final act was incredibly entertaining with a fantastic tease for the final instalment.However, the villain and a lot of the film was very generic. The script was very poor, the pacing was very messy in parts due to the film having way too many characters. A lot of the characters were underused and there was some bad creative decisions.Overall, Fast and furious 9 proves that the franchise is starting to run out of steam, and parts of the films like the characters and plot are wearing thin. But this was another incredibly entertaining from start to finish part of the franchise, with plenty of heart and chemistry showing that the franchise still has some gas left.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Regardless of complaining about physics and giving negative reviews here you can see John Cena show stealing performance but yes there wasn't any car moments like old days. The plot was great especially Jacob's return and all family reunion. Some things were stupid in this movie especially comedy scenes and that space travel. Lmfao this wasn't expected from this franchise. That thing was terrible . The action scenes were okay . Nonetheless the main attraction of this movie was emotions. Ending was average .

It is about Toretto's family past with his brother that was not talked about throughout the saga and how they are involved in espionage, which causes the sides to confront each other.Quality.Some performances good, others not so much.Totally crazy, more than the last two. Jumps and more jumps that defy physical laws.In these two or three moments the effects are not completely achieved, they are computerized, which lowers the quality.They destroy cars like in the other wholesale ones.Relive Han for the sake of it with a bland explanation.With flashback to tone down the forced story they created.In the end they put in too much car destruction that completely distracts you from the ones you are watching.They still come out alive without a scratch.The forced comedy moments.They travel into space and the effects leave much to be desired.They already got tech savvy when it was just street racing.The Rock and Jason are definitely missing.With that post-credits for the next installment.The actor who plays young Dom is very hairy and as an adult he is hairless.He is the least pleasant of the series.",F9 - The Fast Saga

At this point the fans still around know that and have already accepted it. With that said I have enjoyed all the movies up to this one.I'm not sure if it was that the pandemic effected it or the change in directors but this film was ok at best. Even me saying that I believe I'm being biased because im huge fan of the series.First the movie is all over the place. The plot is incoherent, the flow/direction of the movie is odd, the acting/dialogue is average at best, and without giving to much away some of the scenes are just completely unrealistic. The type of stuff you see out of a superhero or john wick esque type of movie. With that said the movie did have some decent action as well as the visuals were pretty good. It also was decent way to pass the time by but for sure isn't winning any awards and has zero rewatchability. I'd only recommend to die hard fans of this series and even so they'll be dissapointed.

95,movieman6-413-929510,The ninth Fast & Furious film can't even with a grain of salt be taken seriously.,4,1 July 2021,"Fast & Furious 9 is the latest movie from the Fast & Furious series. This film is directed in part written and produced by Justin Lin, who has also directed previous Fast & Furious films.In this film, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is haunted by his past, endangering his quiet life. His missing brother Jakob (John Cena) creates life-threatening situations for Dom and the rest of the world. Dom needs the help of his crew to take on his brother in order to protect his family and the rest of the world.The Fast & Furious movies are known for their entertaining, but unbelievable action scenes. Writer Chris Morgan, who was involved in the scripts of the films from the second part, managed to keep the films acceptable. As a viewer you had to take the action scenes with a grain of salt. Since Chris Morgan is not involved with the script of this film, it was written by the director and other unknown writers. This is reflected in the film, because even if you try not to take some moments too seriously, they remain difficult to accept. This film is more like a fabulous science fiction film. Although you can try to enjoy this film as a fan, it does lose the entertainment that the other Fast & Furious films had.The future movie planned for the series and possible other movies will have a hard time regaining the fun of the series. Maybe this will work if Chris Morgan gets back into the movies, otherwise the series seems to have bottomed out. The film loses its tolerable ridiculousness, leaving you with a ridiculous film just like other series that have gone on for too long.While the action sequences are unbelievable, Justin Lin does convey them in an appropriate way, just not as well as he has in his other Fast & Furious directed films.The entire film cast does show that they had fun making this film, but otherwise they do not deliver any special acting. In the other films in the series, they come out a bit better. A problem of the film cast is also the size, because many actors from the series have a large or small role in this film, but some also come across as unnecessary. That way you end up with a lot of characters that are just as fun for the fans to see again, but otherwise they have little value in the final film. Some characters who have died in previous films also return in the film series in a somewhat unclear way. Such decisions only make the film more unrealistic. Even Vin Diesel's character is written in a way that goes against how he comes across in the other films in the series.",F9 - The Fast Saga

The plot was just a typical Fast & Furious or any other action movie plot which although it had its ridiculous, unrealistic and cliched moments, I found it a bit entertaining and I was intrigued till the end. I thought the action scenes were good, however at times they were clearly unrealistic which I wasn't a fan of because I believe there should be a limit of how unrealistic action scenes should be so that they are not too ridiculous which they were in this movie. There's going to be at least two more movies in this franchise which I'm not excited about because it's just getting boring now and we know they won't be great as the earlier movies. There's nothing in this movie that you've not seen before, it's just your regular action movie which I would only recommend watching if it's on TV and you have nothing else to do.",F9 - The Fast Saga

104,FallenEye,Rushed Yet Not Fast and Silly Instead of Furious.,5,26 June 2021,"The closest this F&F outing managed to get to the franchise's thrilling and exciting DNA that kept us coming back for more, were the outrageous stunts, sadly though, even the stunts felt, empty, like a gimmick and, lacked that suspense and thrill; and this misfire of the stunts and action being the closest this movie continued along the franchise's legacy, pretty much sums up just how unimpressive this movie was.F9's pacing was off, many parts of it were rushed, other parts went on for too long, the story was overwhelmingly generic, and the team, didn't feel like the team we know from all the previous installments. The team felt disconnected and desolate.The trailers also did a good job at ruining this movie, and gave away really ALL the interesting parts of it.Fast and Furious 9 / Fast & Furious 9 / F9 / F9: The Fast Saga, which sounds a lot like ""The Infinity Saga"", while to some extent, even the team felt like they were mimicking The Avengers slightly; no matter what name its going by, all it is in the end is a let down, and to be honest, it doesn't even inspire a review.As for going into space - that would've worked wonderfully, by playing into many fan theories and jokes, and being amusingly self-aware, but unfortunately, for it to work wonderfully, the movie itself would've needed to be the absolutely exhilarating, enthralling, entertaining and engaging F&F we expected and hoped it would be, but, it just wasn't, and so the space journey just felt vacuous, much like space, and even stupidity itself.And lastly, Han's return to the land of the living was...

So much so that it seems the filmmakers have chosen to lean into the lavish fight sequences and cartoonish excess. But with the over the top action in the drivers seat, any plot development seems like unnecessary baggage. Dialogue about whatever government agency will be the excuse for the next car chase is tedious, and any swing at sentimentality is hilariously cheesy. At this point, the F&F series just needs to do away with talking altogether and just make good on 90 minutes of pure uninterrupted, mindless action.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Yea, multiply that with 9 and throw in some space-flying cars and you have this movie.But on the other hand it is kinda fun, kinda entertaining, it is goofy and silly in an over the top sort of way.In other words, if you can completely disconnect your brain for 2 hours and accept everything that goes on in this stupid movie, then you could perhaps maybe possibly like it.I give it a very, very generous 4/10 because there is something liberating with this level of stupid.

116,blrnani,Right for the times,6,23 October 2021,"F&F 7 was a beautiful tribute to Paul Walker. F&F8 was over the top in a slightly irritating way that probably left fans thinking the next one better be an upgrade or support is going to start eroding. But then the pandemic hit!F&F9 is even more absurdly over the top than the previous one, but I think it judged audience needs quite well, as we are all needing a bit of escapism that is actually fun entertainment. It is a bit reminiscent of the Bond movies that Roger Moore got saddled with, which often verged on slapstick and are now seen as a low point in the Bond franchise.So a word of warning to the producers and directors. Take some time over the next one. Make the script a strong one, with fewer long pauses for 'meaningful looks' that are supposed to ram home the F&F messages. Chasing the Avengers franchise after ever more humungous threats to the known universe is a dead end street, so keep it simple next time. There is no shortage of threats in our society and the real superheroes are the parents trying to bring their children up to be good conscientious young citizens.

119,totalovrdose,Going Off The Rails,5,24 May 2021,"The Fast and the Furious 9 is the Terminator Genysis of the franchise. The number of past incidents that have been subverted, corrected, altered or changed, to accommodate this narrative, will make your head spin. If you have to go back and alter key moments in your movie series to have the new one work, clearly something is amiss. Due to this, it can be very hard to follow, even for series veterans. I saw the newest instalment with a fan, who kept asking me questions to confirm what was happening - and to be honest, more than once, even I didn't have an answer.You will notice that Chris Morgan and Gary Scott Thompson do not have writing credits on this film, and believe me, their departure shows. The franchise had pushed the suspension of disbelief factor to its limits, but what happens in this film teeters on the edge of just plain silly. There is a running gag in the film, as characters point out how they constantly survive, theorizing they are 'immortal'. This only draws attention to the fact that characters are in one car wreck, explosion and shoot out after another, and constantly come out without a scratch. What originally made the Fast series so likable was that these were ordinary people, doing extraordinary things. They were mortal, and could be killed, which made it all the more exhilarating. Now, they are invincible, which makes every accomplishment that much less entertaining, because we know the outcome. This inevitably leads to predictability.As for the story, this is one of the weakest parts of the feature. Dom (Vin Diesel) has hung up his cape, so when Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris) and Ramsey (Nathaniel Emmanuel) come to him with a gig, concerning the disappearance of Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russel) and the re-emergence of Cipher (Charlize Theron), he initially ignores the call, wanting to instead focus on raising his child. That is, until he finds evidence suggesting that his long-abandoned brother, Jakob (John Cena) is responsible.The interweaving of Jakob into the plot, which is done non-chronologically over the course of the film, going back and forth between 1989 and the present-day, touching on past events merely spoken about in previous entries, is probably one of the best executed parts of the movie. The theme of love, family and friendship is ever prevalent, however, the clashing of two powerhouses; Diesel and Cena, is nowhere near as phenomenal as viewers may have hoped. This is not like the time when The Rock and Diesel had their confrontation in Fast Five, and the chemistry overall is less explosive. In fact, it's almost non-existent.Cena's Jakob is the only character in the film with a decent ark. This ultimately makes for a pointless story, for almost every character starts at the same place that they end up. There is zero growth. With that said, Cena does a good job with what he has; the problem is, there isn't much of it. There are entire scenes where he says nothing. He is severely underused. Worse still, is Cipher. Theron easily has the best lines in the movie; despite only having about 5 minutes of screen time. She is cold, calculating and menacing, and you truly wish she was the lead character. Instead, the film introduces Otto (Thue Ersted Rasmussen) as one of the lead antagonists; a young man with daddy issues, who wishes to take over the world. He is not taken seriously by the other characters, and his hyperbolic persona leaves him looking like a c-grade cookie-cutter Bond villain. Sheesh!Similarly, to its predecessor, F9 is bloated with an over-abundance of characters, some of which could have been removed from the film entirely, as they do little to move the plot forward. Bringing back Mia (Jordana Brewster) is actually one of the film's best decisions, and unlike instalments 6 and 7, she actually has a meaty chunk of things to do here. The always entertaining Sung Kang as Han is back, and this time he's accompanied by a cute ninja girl (Anna Sawai), because apparently, every Asian girl is a cute ninja girl.Seeing what has happened to Sean (Lucas Black) however, seems insanely out of character for him. This leads into yet another issue with the movie; the action set-pieces take precedence over character and story, and thus, many things just seem forced. Take Mr. Nobody as a further example, who has gone from a character, to a plot device; suddenly, half of the cast in the franchise are his agents, a technique attempted to explain away every bizarre decision in the film.Then we get to the editing. Let it be known, Justin Lin's fourth, fifth and sixth entries, are my favorites in this long-running franchise. That said, I don't feel his exceptional attention to detail in this film. Often, scenes sporadically cut from one thing to another, and it honestly feels like we, the audience, are missing out; as though the movie is so desperate to show the next confrontation or joke, that they gloss over everything else. By the end, I had so many unanswered questions. I know; it's a movie, but there was so much in this film that was not even addressed. Don't even get me started on the end credit scene; I'm still shaking my head nonsensically over that one.Moving on, nothing negative could be said for the score, which really intensifies the moments, though, what we see on screen rarely lives up to the impact the music touts it as. The stunts, though utterly bonkers, will often bring a smile, though there is noticeably less mayhem than in the previous few entries. Don't get me wrong - plenty of things are destroyed, but compared to past entries, there is a sizeable downgrade.Overall, that's just it; compared to the other movies, F9 does not measure up. So much has been changed to get us to where we are with this franchise, and after everything that happened, only to basically end up exactly where we were at the end of F8, I'm left wondering, seriously, what's the point?",F9 - The Fast Saga

There's no way you can expect to have any kind of fun if you don't. With that said, F9 offered more insight into the characters and sudden ""Dom's brother"" development with well-written flashbacks using different actors to portray their younger selves. This was refreshing and made the emotions of the movie feel less strained and more natural. Of course, don't expect any stellar performances Vin Diesel is still Vin Diesel and John Cena is, well, John Cena. The humor of Tyrese's character was great and other characters had moments too. Only a little disappointed that neither Statham nor The Rock made appearances, but the way it ended I'm actually excited for a sequel. The action was ludicrous (pun intended) but very entertaining, and at 2 and a half hours it honestly didn't feel as long.",F9 - The Fast Saga
121,Slarkshark,I'm a Sucker for this Franchise,7,26 June 2021,"But I know I'm not alone, up until this point at least. This has no business being rated a 7. The reason I gave it that was for the flashbacks/back story. By far the best parts of the movie; that's true Fast and Furious, and brought me right back to the one that started it all. The whole story that Dom has a brother I actually got on board with, which I didnt think I would when watching the trailers. Bringing Han back... not as much, even though I've always really liked his character.It's just gotten so ridiculous on so many levels. It really is in all actuality completely unbelievable in every literal sense of the word. To the point that they are even acknowledging it in the movie to a certain degree and making fun of how ridiculous and ""invincible"" they are. Not only that, the cheese level keeps getting cranked up as the franchise goes on as well. Another note, they blew up Francis! I'm not okay with that.The nod to Brian in the end was nice, but Paul Walker's death still stings and these movies will never be the same without him.",F9 - The Fast Saga

126,Spartan_1_1_7,Diminishing Returns and Franchise Fatigue is Really Apparent Now,5,8 August 2021,"Ah yes, back at it again with FAMILY. Fast and Furious 9 is the latest entry in this rollercoaster of a franchise that started from humble beginnings and ended up being a worldwide blockbuster juggernaut. I've loved this franchise since I watched the first two back in the day and I still hold the opinion that they should have ended it with Furious 7 as that would have been a perfect finale. The two entries after that, while trying to outdo each other and trying to be bigger and more ridiculous, are showing major signs of diminishing returns and franchise fatigue. There were signs even prior to that but now, it's very apparent.Now, they are aware of how ridiculous all of this has gotten and they do try to capitalize on that with a lot of self-referential remarks and whatnot but the writing and execution both fall short on an overall scale for it to come to fruition properly.For one thing, the characters are again just shallow caricatures of their former selves, only dishing out one-liners after one-liners which aren't even that well thought out. The performances even reflect that as many a times it's as if they are not even into it anymore. Characters such as Roman and his group have been the comedic relief for a long time but now it's not even that funny anymore and there is that CinemaSins voice at the back of my mind that keeps hollering (Earn that paycheck Tyrese) whenever there is a cringy attempt at humour, which certainly causes amusement, so there's that, and I still preferred it over the other stuff, especially when it got combined with the Toky Drift crew, something I wish they had given more screentime to.On the flip side, you have Dom and his FAMILY shtick which has been milked to death and I do get the meme appeal but they really gotta stop making it so melodramatic and serious and instead inject fun into it, especially when a lot of the movie is in that state. Even with John Cena coming into the picture now as Dom's long lost brother outta nowhere, I was enjoying the cringe humour a lot more than the cringe family melodrama trying to make things full circle again.Death has no power here anymore, neither does Physics. There's also a Supersoldier Serum that most of the characters got administered a few sequels back and it's stronger than ever here, kinda reminded me of Black Widow and how the ""normal"" humans had somehow Supersoldier Serum too. Sure, this is a result of trying to outdo what came before and in some parts, it works, but without much creativity put in on how to make the characters get out of those situations instead of just LUCK and SuperPowers, instead of having proper thrills, it just kinda turns into this mellow blur for the most part, which is disappointing. Fast 5, which is nothing compared to these sequels in terms of BIG action sequences is still so much more thrilling.Some of that has to do with the fact that the editing and pacing were just not good. The movie is about 2 hours and 15 mins long and while it does move fast, it does so in a haphazard way with scenes just happening one over the other without any proper sense of build-up or anticipation. It does, however, not get properly boring so there's that. The action scenes themselves just didn't have that energy for the most part. I don't know, there was this weird subdued nature despite all the noise and visual flare being thrown at you, for the most part. Some scenes were still fun.Having most of the characters from the franchise in some capacity I one movie had its own appeal. The themes of FAMILY banging you over the head a lot but the nostalgia for those characters is real and they know that.All in all, if you like/love the franchise and have stuck till now, you'll probably have a decent enough time, especially if you have a home theatre. Just don't expect the best entry yet or something along those lines, it's the weakest as far as I'm concerned. Didn't hate it, wasn't terrible, but wasn't good either. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 5/10.P. S We used to joke and meme about them going to space. They actually went ahead and did it, so that was ridiculous fun. XD.",F9 - The Fast Saga

128,jjburkekid,Fun but generic,6,25 June 2021,"I will admit, even with some stupid space aspects, I think these movies are a lot of dumb fun. The action is really good, with good effects and has lots of suspense in each one. The action may be good, but the story isn't all that great. The story is just a generic Fast & Furious movie, with so-called life ending stakes. The story with Don facing up against his brother sounds fine, and was fine, I guess. I liked how Han came back, but I bet it's only because of the fan base, if there is even still one. The characters are back, and they made a decent return. There the same they were, nothing really changed. Overall, F9 is a fine Fast & Furious movie, with nothing special added, unless you count the dumb space aspects.(P. S: this is my 100th review on IMDb).",F9 - The Fast Saga
129,hoernkeem,"F9: The Fast Saga (2021, Justin Lin) Fast Saga revs up more Furious than ever although they seem to be running out of plot",6,29 July 2021,"One of the only non comic book non Disney film franchise juggernauts returns with its ninth installment. It almost seems laughable, but they have really found a way to keep propelling the Fast movies forward on, at the very least, a spectacle scale even if the plot ideas are starting to become stale and derivative. Justin Lin returns to the fold for his fifth outing as 'Fast & Furious' director, but his first since 2013's 'Fast & Furious 6'. This film is a direct sequel to 'The Fate of the Furious' featuring characters such as Kurt Russell's Mr. Nobody and Charlize Theron as villain-in-chief, Cipher. Family, as always, remains a heavy melodramatic theme in these action films and to that end they add John Cena playing Vin Diesel's brother Jakob. Nature apparently abhors a WWE vacuum and the void that Dwayne Johnson left had to be filled by an equally larger than life wrestling persona.To start there is a lot of backstory and interspersed flashback scenes with Dom, his brother Jakob and their Dad setting up the relationships, and the bad blood and the misunderstandings that would form the core of this film because as the action plays out for the most of the narrative Jakob is the primary antagonist to Dom and his crew. Cipher, the villain from the previous film, is also in the mix but to a lesser extent at least until the end. The plot is too wonky to hash out in much detail as it just becomes an excuse for the ridiculous, balls out action set pieces which are amped up yet again for this outing peaking with Tyrese and Ludacris on a Pontiac Fiero spaceship. Basically there is a widget controller for some godlike weapons system and it is in two pieces and the race is on to collect these two pieces and an operational key. The bad guys want it to rule or destroy the world or some such, and the good guys are looking to prevent all that. Ultimately there are lot of car and weapons based showdowns up to and including using large magnets as new and fun innovative weapons. All of the action is ridiculous but they lean into it so hard that this is about the one franchise that we allow them all these bonkers trespasses. They are very aware of it too as there is a whole story thread with Tyrese's Roman recognizing how they may be invincible because they keep coming out of these encounters no worse for the wear. Of course Dom and friends triumph, but not before uber villain Cipher gets away to fight in another sequel. Predictably by the close of business the John Cena character may be coming around to the side of good because, as we know with many of these characters, even if introduced as enemies eventually they come around to the side of good. On that note we also get the return of tried and true 'Fast & Furious' character Han who was thought killed by Jason Statham's character once upon a time and since Statham's character is also now on the side of good that eases that character's conscience a bit as well.This is a pretty standard outing for the franchise and if you have been on board and a fan of the franchise for a while you will have fun and enjoy this outing as well. I do appreciate the ramped up action and car and weapons stunts each and every time. While I like the addition of Cena overall he is no Dwayne Johnson so it is a shame that Diesel and Johnson couldn't just learn to get along for a minute. While I didn't mind them adding more family into the mix with Dom's brother I was not a fan of all the flashback scenes. I thought they just took us out of the moment and weren't necessary. They could have communicated all that with some simple exposition. I applaud the return of Han as no one liked the idea of him not being around anymore. One odd plot point though was our heroes were initially following a signal to find Mr. Nobody's downed plane, but they never really explained what happened with that character. It wasn't clear if he was dead or missing or other. He was just gone and that stuck with me as a plot hole. I also found it interesting that they continue to forge a path with Paul Walker's character still actually alive in the narrative. I always assumed at some point the story would acknowledge him as deceased to match real life, but that is clearly not the path they want to go down so instead they keep coming up with clunky, awkward ways to not have him in the story. While not a film without issues this is actually one of the few instances where we don't care much about superfluous story stuff and as long as the action is large, loud and glorious then all is good, and this sequel lives up to that mantra and thus all is good in the 'Furious' world.Eric's Grade: B-",F9 - The Fast Saga

This is a movie made for pure enjoyment
It's hilarious but also very well directed
The action sequences were masterfully executed
The plot was insane but the actors were actually enjoying being there.Now the crew has supepowers.It's over the top funny
Vin Diesel at one point becomes Samson (without the hair)
Others can survive in space for weeks in a car
The have all become undead, and even the dead return.Nobody understand why Cipher is in a cage and when my kids asked me during the movies why she is in a cage I told them she had contracted covid19 which was the most reasonable explanation.John Cena is helping an evil dictator who the collaborates with Cipher so he wants to get rid of Cena . And then he acts surprised (even though he wanted to control the world) and remembers his bro and sis and suddenly everything is OK.It does not make sense BUT it surely is pure fun and enjoyment but definitely a movie made for theatres..

Oh, and did I mention they are wearing scuba gear from the 1950s while flying the car in space? I guess you don´t need real training for space nor astronaut suits according to F9. At least the Mel Brooks movie was a parody and it was really funny.F9 is like a cartoon from the Hot Wheels TV series only with real humans. Physics and intelligence don´t apply here.In F9 all of the characters are tech saavy, fly cargo airplanes and are weapons experts, without mentioning that now they somehow behave like superhumans in the action scenes and don´t even get a scratch.And the trailer gives away too much so when you watch the scene you basically know what´s coming.This has turned from a more realistic normal action-drama about street car racing to a sci-fi laughable mocking money grab movie.

I've never seen a car and a scuba diving suit survive the vacuum and subzero temperatures of space. I've never seen human beings bounce off concrete time and time again and just walk it off. This movie is so full of crap my screen turned brown.It would have been great to end the franchise by going back to the basics. Instead they actually thought doing overly outlandish stunts would make this pig of a movie fly.Fast and Furious has devolved into The Itchy and Scratchy Show, but not as good. It's just stupid now with no sense of continuity or semblance of reality. I advise against watching this shell of a movie until it's available to stream for free. You are not missing anything other than the feeling you wasted your time watching this nonsense.I feel that the loony tunes in Hollywood don't care about making a quality product anymore. They are just vomiting out movies as fast as they can for the sake of having a revenue stream.I wonder why stars put their names on such obvious garbage.

148,kaden_lewis,F9,10,5 August 2021,"Ok, I know a 10/10 is a little generous, but this was actually one of my favorite Fast and Furious movies. Sure, this movie was without a doubt THE stupidest, most unrealistic movie of the franchise and it isn't even close, but when I watch the Fast and Furious movies, I don't rate them based on that. I rate them based on how good of a Fast and Furious movie it was. How is the absurd action? Is it entertaining? How is the incredibly unrealistic plot? With this movie, I can say I was entertained with the action and the plot as silly and unrealistic as it was. This movie was the pure definition of what a Fast and Furious movie is. Something that is getting absolutely no recognition in this movie is how we got to see Dom's origin. The movie opens on a racetrack with Dom's dad racing a Nascar, we then see that his dad gets into a crash and dies. That then leads to a young Dom beating a man with a wrench defending his dead dads honor. I thought the addition to that was pretty cool because in the very first movie, they mention Dom almost beating a man to death with a wrench. I also liked how while at a street race still with young Dom, we also got to see a young Mia, Letty, Jesse, and Vince. I think the scenes with the younger versions of the main characters really helped bring the series together a little bit. I think they should have been in an earlier movie, but they fit great in this one. I personally though they did a pretty good job writing how Han didn't actually die in the car explosion, it was totally a Fast and Furious way to do it, and I just personally liked the fact that Han was working with Mr. Nobody for a bit. Finally, the end scene was just like any other ending to a Fast and Furious movie, a barbecue at the Toretto house, but this one was special. We got to see Han reunite with his Tokyo Drift crew, and we got to see a car pull into the driveway, implied to be Brian. I though that was an amazing way to end the movie. Another little thing I liked was how we got a classic 1989 Universal intro at the beginning of the movie because the opening scene took place in 1989. I though it was pretty cool.Some advice I would give to everyone, you need to know what you are going to watch when watching these movies, you know they are going to be stupid, but enjoy it, sit back and be entertained. I definitely recommend this to any Fast and Furious fan who is questioning going to see it based on its absurd 5.3/10 review (At the time of my review), it is a good Fast and Furious movie if you were willing to accept that it was going to be stupid.",F9 - The Fast Saga
149,T-ZER0,The Fast Saga,4,6 July 2021,"WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!!!So after a ton of delays Fast 9 is here. How is it? Good and bad. I'll say this, if you're a person who has enjoyed every movie so far, the action and the characters, you will like this one. However, for me, it's not terrible. But watching it reminds me of how much the franchise has changed and not for the better.I'm not ranting or saying this movie is awful, here's the issue I have. My favorite F&F movie was the first one. What I loved about it was the simple action, plot and great music. That is what drew me into the franchise. This film seems like it's repeating the same formula from the previous three movies. I can't tell you how many times Dom has nearly died in these films only to be alive about 30 seconds to 1 minute later.I also felt sad, because even though Fate of the Furious came before, this is the one movie in the franchise I felt desperately needed Brian (Paul Walker). I kept wondering, what would Brian do in this situation? But I don't want to wonder that, because I want Paul Walker here.They made the universe of F&F smaller in this film as well. Bringing back Han is okay, but it seems like they dulled down the villainous side of Deckard Shaw. Killing Han was the one thing that we were like, WOW! This guy is a true villain. Now it's like: ""Wow. He can't kill someone right."" Not to mention, Don's father's death was caused by his younger brother. To me this just makes the franchise seem like a small universe rather than a big one. Even Giselle worked for Mr. Nobody! I thought she was ex-military who did small jobs for Braga then joined Dom's crew. Not everyone has to be connected to each other.Everything does not have to have an explanation or backstory. Sometimes when a story does not have either is helps fans come up with their own story or possibility to guess what they story is, which makes it fun.Out of all the ideas they had to send Roman and Tej into space. Which no offense, I believe is really grasping at straws. But I guess they are trying to do EVERYTHING with cars now, so why not make them go to space? The reminder at the end where Dom says to Jacob, ""Someone once owned me a ten second car"", doesn't fill me with nostalgia. It still makes me sad because of Paul Walker. Speaking of which, showing a car pull up at the end to Dom's house is not the tribute to Brian I wanted.So, Cipher is back, and I for the record like Charlize Theron. But she got away again, when Dom destroyed the plane she was piloting, I literally thought she was in it and I cheered, but when I discovered she wasn't and got away, I was disappointed because this is literally the same ending as the Fate of the Furious. She gets away.But the movie ends as usual, with them saying grace and Brian showing up but not actually showing the actor. Then there's a end credits scene where Deckard Shaw comes face to face with Han.For me, the franchise has gone so far away from its roots and has become sort of like James Bond or Mission Impossible, but if that's enough for you, you will enjoy it. For me, I miss the days where it was just simply Paul Walker and Vin Diesel playing off each other in the films. Not John Cena and Cardi B, who for some reason, I could not understand a word she said in the film....",F9 - The Fast Saga

I went watching expecting nothing crazy that probably would have an exaggerated plot and some good action but I found something almost as boring as watching a black screen for two hours. And even worse than the boring aspect the movie is really bad: the action scenes are barely comprehensible, the acting is hilarious for the wrong reasons and the move is at least 30 minutes longer than it should have been. The only thing that it can be saved is the CGI but it's not enough to make this movie enjoyable or rewatchable for me.",F9 - The Fast Saga

S. and other markets.The film opens with a flashback to the 1980s where young Dominic and his brother experience an event that changes their lives and drives a wedge between them. Moving forward to the present day, Dom (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), are living in seclusion with Dom's son.When the crew shows up unexpectedly with a mission from Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell); who has gone missing, the crew venture out to retrieve a missing device which in turn puts them directly in the path with nefarious individuals and a ghost from Dom's past.As anyone who has watched any films in the series knows; the plots are often thin and a bit absurd as they serve simply as a device for the cast to assemble and chase a McGuffin to save the day. In doing so; the audience knows there will be an abundance of fists, bullets, cars, crashes, and outrageous stunts along the way.While reality and credibility are not words associated with the franchise, the cast eagerly plays along with the absurdity, action, and mayhem and gives fans what they want. While the middle portion dragged while the audience was given more of the setup and introduced to cast members old and new; the action sequences are the over-the-top show stoppers which have become a staple of the franchise.Director Justin Lin knows this and his return to the franchise does not attempt to invoke any new wrinkles and gives fans what they expect. The large ensemble works well with one another and John Cena is a very interesting addition to the cast.Audiences will want to make sure to stay seated for a bonus scene that sets up the next film or spin-off very well and opens up some very interesting possibilities.In the end ""F9 The Fast Saga"" gives audiences a dose of high-octane adrenaline and a return to no-brainer over the top action when it is needed the most. Check your brain at the door, strap in, and enjoy the ride.",F9 - The Fast Saga
155,chris_rowe-881-168820,Honestly just awful,1,9 August 2021,"This movie was possibly the worst film I've ever seen and I'm taking comparatively as the budget here makes it ridiculous this was so bad.Firstly Vin Diesel isn't an actor, he's a robot with a deep voice, can't show emotions and isn't a big enough guy compared to what we see these days, he has got by so fair play to him, but the constant need to do the reveals, end scenes and look invincible is pathetic, the faces he pulls and the cringe way he tries to look cool is just embarrassingFrankly outside of Theron and Helen there weren't any performances that were good Cena wasn't too bad and Natalie was good as usual but the rest either looked too old or just were wooden, none looked cool or badass and it was just lame.The dialogue to act cool and think anything was funny is beyond me, ludicrus and gibsons banter was 10 years out of date and it wasn't cool then, it tries so hard to seem cool by talking like morons and ignoring the ludicrous situations.Ok suspended belief is cinema and I get that and I'm good at that, the physics in this film were impossible, the scene in space and everything in between was just nonsense, it didn't work or look good because it had no link to reality, atleast the others however daft were just about plausible.They even joke about it in the movie, the one scene with Gibson in a cave with 12 guys and gets out unscathed is stupid, I hate how trained guys can't use guns in movies and miss everything, it's stupid, but they can hulk you and wipe out 12 people... okThe story sucked, the same family love rubbish mixed with spy rubbish and you get this rubbish, the chemistry was poor and film draggedIt became a parody and comedy quickly because it was honestly beyond terrible from one liners that make you want to punch the tv to bin diesels emotionless face trying to act like he's a deep sensitive guyLastly the name, they act like it's up there with James Bond or someone of that pull but it's just not, he's not an all time great, just a guy who manages to get in an action film series with cars that has coasted through 10 films, should've stopped when Paul died.Series is beyond saving, no cameos, stars or money can ever recover it, just let it die honestly it's just embarrassing seeing these old looking actors try and sound cool.Rubbish is being kind.Continuity and logic died after 5 minutes and every time I tried to think about how something existed I became angry.

163,theemuhammede,please stop,2,25 June 2021,"The Fast and Furious franchise has become something terrible. Its foundation was amazing with their first two movies. The movies were all about the cars and family. But sadly, it has turned into some of the most unrealistic storylines imaginable. Honestly, I do not consider F9 to be a Fast and Furious movie.Really the only things I enjoyed about this movie were the story behind Toretto's father being brought to life and John Cena's performance as Jacob Toretto. Although it is eight movies late, Toretto's father's story was finally brought to life on screen; previously in the first movie, it was only briefly talked about between Dominic and Brian. Cena's performance as Toretto was greater than I expected. I was worried that he would turn ""WWE"" in the movie, and I did not want to see that although I am a fan of WWE. It happened in Fast Five with Dwayne Johnson where his turning point was when he told Toretto that he would ride with him; at that point, his character went from being Hobbs to being The Rock, and I did not like that.It is so disappointing to see such a great movie franchise steer so far away from its roots. It is no longer about the cars. Is it too much to ask for a car being built on screen as the Supra was in the first one? That aspect is so important because a lot was learned about the characters involved. Now building cars is not even a thought. The movie just went from country to country with new cars with crazy tech in each cut. The movie took place in what seemed to be two days. Where are you getting all these new cars from and how are you replacing them so quickly? Come on.The action sequences were so out of this world that it was not believable. You mean to tell me a country's military is shooting at you point blank and they all miss. But then you can turn around with a pistol and randomly take down half their squad? Get out of here. Another one that got me was let us be shot at by missiles from a military aircraft and then jump out of the truck with not a single scratch. Get out of here.Han's return was so ridiculous. The trailers should not have shown that; in fact, the trailers revealed way too much for this movie. There were a few people in the theater that briefly clapped when Han returned, but it really was so poorly presented in the movie that it felt like ""oh, I guess he is back... cool"".Universal had a whole extra year to work with this movie because of the pandemic, and it still produced crap. They need to stop with this ""agents saving the world"" and go back to their roots. Make things about the cars again. Let's see a good race like the opening scene to 2 Fast 2 Furious. Make things about family and the relationships they build together. With the way this franchise is turning, I do not know if I will watch any future installments they produce.",F9 - The Fast Saga
164,arod_85,Dumb,6,27 June 2021,"I liked the franchise in the beginning, but as time has passed they began to take the movies less and less seriously. This one was just plain dumb. The plot was dumb, the constant use of a giant magnet was dumb, characters jumping off and landing onto speeding cars was dumb. Sending characters into space with a rocket strapped to a car was dumb. The return of a character we saw murdered on screen without a strong explanation was dumb. The constant coincidences that made zero sense was dumb. Come to think of it, I am dumb for sitting through this movie. Another thing I think is dumb is when sequels add last minute siblings with no mention of them in earlier movies. This annoyed me greatly with Hobbs and Shaw and it really annoyed me with this movie. Dom's brother was such an apparent after thought. Seems like the franchise was trying to send a message to Dwayne J. By casting John Cena after all the backlash DJ got from staring in a spin-off. Well, it backfired because John was not believable as a Toretto, speed racer, or a spy. He did not have the chops to pull off a character in the Fast universe like Dwayne J did. Also, when did these guys become highly trained elite heroes? The whole tone of the franchise has completely changed. I liked them better as thieves that raced. I can go on a rant about this movie for days so I'll spare you and end here.",F9 - The Fast Saga
165,alexscott-35299,For the love of god please end this already!,3,27 June 2021,"This movie is a task to sit through. I found myself with deja vu watching this as it is literally just the same as the last 4 movies just so much worse! The acting in this is genuinely laughable and sometimes I actually did laugh at some of the line deliveries, John Cena needs to quit acting ASAP as he is so so wooden and so boring. Not having the rock or Jason Statham in this really did hurt the film as they are by far the most enjoyable characters and that's why Hobbs and Shaw worked so well. The casting in this aswell was just terrible. I quite liked the casting of Finn Cole as young Jacob Torreto as he is a great actor and actually resembles John Cena, but for the casting of young Dominic Torreto it's a whole different story, the guy looks in his late 20s and looks absolutely nothing like Vin Diesel, how are we supposed to believe the character when he looks nothing at all like who he is supposed to be. The story is just the same crap they used for the last few movies, like seriously how many things have been made that can end the world and why is it always this group of people who have to save it. Also the action scenes look terrible, the way they were shot and choreographed just looks cheap and crap. I did like the space scene as it was actually well shot and looked good with the special effects. Tej and Roman save this film big time as they are the only interesting and funny characters in the whole film and every time they're on screen I was actually enjoying it but sadly they aren't in it enough. I did also like that Roman actually mentioned the fact that they must be invincible and actually referenced the whole joke of why and how do they survive all these missions without getting injured, I just thought it was a really clever and meta way to reference it. Please for the love of god do not make another one of these films unless it's a Hobbs and Shaw sequel as that was actually enjoyable. Don't see this movie and maybe if it flops they will stop this god awful franchise and save us the troubles. Absolutely terrible!",F9 - The Fast Saga

167,waltermwilliams,Fast & Furious 9 is out of this world literally,6,18 June 2021,"""Fast & Furious 9"" takes stunts out of this world 'literally' in the latest and penultimate instalment in this Franchise that started 20 years ago.The movies have always centred around the Toretto family headed by Vin Diesel (Dominic) and even more so in their newest action, adventure & crime film.And the other main player for most of those years Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner even gets a nod in the 9th movie although he tragically died ironically in a car crash on Saturday November 30, 2013 after attending a charity event.As Billy Joel so aptly put it ""Only The Good Die Young"".Death didn't put the mockers on Walker popping up in ""Fast &
Furious 7"" two years after he was buried.Talking stone cold another wrestler gets a guernsey in this latest edition, John Cena as Jakob, Dominic Toretto's younger brother.Meanwhile Dwayne Johnson did not return.Word on the street is Tyrese Gibson (Roman) and 'The Rock' did not play well together.Don't worry because some of your other faves make a return, but no spoilers here.In fact, ""F9"" is more like a reunion movie so watch out for some blasts from the past resurfacing and pleasing cinema audiences.Judging by the sighs from the crowd I sat with for 145 minutes.You heard right at 2 hours and 25 minutes this is the longest ""Fast & Furious"" film to date.It is a thing of beauty to watch on the big screen with all its locations looking amazing in Super 35mm film...another first for this franchise and with Panavision Panaflex cameras which in geek speak means it looks amaze balls.Car nuts watch out for: 2020 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Widebody driven by Dom and so much more Car Porn.One of the disappointments for me was writer Chris Morgan was not attached for the first time since ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" and the script is weaker because of it, and also it turns into Science Fiction like they are Superheroes who joined either the Marvel or DC Universe.Roman is self-aware that after all their world wide adventures and crazy arse stunts none of them have even a scratch on them.The upside is Justin Lin returns as director...last seen on ""F6"".If you've been a fan of the Fast Family forever buckle up as the Fast saga continues and don't leave before the lights come on or you'll miss the perfunctory BBQ and another Easter Egg.The plot for the tenth and final film of the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise is still under wraps, but it's going have to be mammoth to beat the trill ride that is ""F9""...Walker may have to come back as a Zombie and the Cars land on Mars...the bar has been set sky high...literally!

You will have also seen that I had less favour upon FF7 & FF8. Well, FF9 follows in line with the last two. This isn't a ""Fast and Furious"" film anymore. It's now turned into too much of ""Mission Impossible"" type movie.There's too much going on and too much of the impossible. Rocket man? Really!? Super powered magnets that push and pull multi ton vehicles? Really? Because the realism isn't there. The enjoyment isn't there. Too much CGI going on. Also, the jokes have become stale. They used to be funny, but now they're being rehashed so much that I sit there thinking, ""Yeah, you said that before and it was funny then that one time.""I will say that I enjoyed having the crew back together. They still bond and work of each other well. The addition of John Cena in this one worked, but his acting is still a little too rigid to truly enjoy. The only good part about this movies storyline were the flashbacks that show the connection between Dom and Jacob. Otherwise, as stated above, the story was too over the top to enjoy.If you were to ask me if I'd see this movie in theatres again knowing how the movie turned out. I would say only on a cheap movie night or a gift card. As nice as it was seeing this film in IMAX. It just didn't live up to expectations. I managed to avoid trailers for this film. If I heard rumours of anything is was because of word of mouth. I enjoyed the franchise up until 6, but it's time for it to end. Hopefully it will at 10, but for now Fast fans.

I don't understand why did they have to replace the strong female protagonist with some bald dude, but other than that - there are two black comic reliefs, there's slapstick humor, erotic humor and the action that makes Looney Tunes seem realistic. Two hours well spent if all you want is some stoner comedy. It doesn't really light a candle to the previous Scary Movie installments, not even to the fifth, but we all know it was fake, but it's still better than something cheap like Paranormal Movie. Well, maybe not, but it has the budget and some decent faces. They don't do much, but that's not why you watch Scary Movie now, is it? Oh, another fine addition are the superpowers. Marvel should really watch out, because Scary Movie is really branching into new territories now. Can't wait for Part 7 if this is how expensive these new parodies are going to be.And can someone explain what is a toretto? Does it have something to do with a tourette syndrome? Because the torettto character just kept spouting some random stuff that I suppose had meaning or I should have reacted to, but it was just so random. At least it wasn't cursing, like in South Park. From what I can gather - the movie is trying to revolve its comedy around disabled people and it's kind of uncool, but still funny.

It honestly shows this series is just a money grab and the director and producers no longer care about it. It's sad. As for the action, it was very over the top in every single moment.

F9 announcement was pleasantly surprising due to return of Justin Lin in director's chair after F6. He is the one who lifted up the franchise. But that hope was ruined with the release of F9. This is absolute mindless trash with sme shots that mock at the thinking capacity of viewers.The series has been given certain liberties considering it is a high budget action film but driving a car strapped to rocket in space is ridiculous.Often it was considered F7 as the bad film in recent times.

Which I expected to see since watching ""Hobbes & Shaw"".The other drawcard is the history with the original characters who bring their own entertaining personalities.Cars are still in the movie. But still unrealistically utilised like movies three through eight. It is almost like watching a superhero movie based on a comic book.Hobbes & Shaw also have nothing to do with this movie.I enjoyed watching it in the cheap seats.

218,iamianiman,"Enjoyably fun, but Fast 9 just doesn't respect the dead",3,25 October 2021,"Fast and Furious 9, hmm where do I start?😂😂Let's start with the good. One of it being Dom's backstory. Now we know how his father died and why he becomes what he is now. And I am glad Mia is back! Cause she has always been my favourite!😍I also love the first battle scene in the palm forest. That's the best one out of all the others in the film. It's fun, exciting and adrenaline rush.Okay, now let's move on with the not-so-great materials. Fast 9 feels like a cheesy parody trying to be on par with the previous films only to fail this time. It doesn't really feel like a pure Fast and Furious film. 😂😂 All the ideas are as if they have found all of them online; like they use all of the fans preposterous 'What if?' ideas, and made it into a film. A bad film.In terms of enjoyability and entertainment, previous F&Fs are better, this one lacks a little probably due to its ridiculous sequences. Don't get me wrong, it still manages to be enjoyable but the predecessors are better. The previous ones, we can still suspend our disbelief, but Fast 9 just takes everything to a different level. It breaks the threshold and expects people to swallow everything down our throat. Tyrese Gibson said, they are basically invincible, meaning there's no stakes anymore. We know by now everyone is gonna be alive.Fast 9 doesn't respect death or passing. Instead of revealing that Dom has a brother after 8 films and bringing back Hans, what they can do is recruit new people who don't have a family or have always wanted to become part of the family. In that way, it will be better.If you asked me which F&F is the best, James Wan's Furious 7 still stands strong, the only one that I saw 9 times in the cinemas. Others don't even get close. From the actions, cars and locations to cinematography, songs, costumes and ending are all absolutely menacingly impeccable.But whatever it is, the good thing about this franchise is even we know the movie is ridiculous, it will always attract people to watch it in one way or another.

I have personally loved them, I don't go into them expecting a lot I just enjoy the fun, heart, humour & cars! This is another brilliant one in an incredible franchise. I loved the start flashbacks of Dom & Jakob, learning about their Dad & seeing the moment Dom mentioned in a past film about why he got locked up. The first real action scenes with Roman getting out of that gun fight was truly ridiculous you just have to laugh but it sets in motion a running gag for the film about immortality. The film has a rather good story & it's nice to have Mia back + seeing the Tokyo Drift crew again. Ramsey is a brilliant character for this franchise & I'm glad she got more screen time in this one. Tej & Roman going to space is probably the most ridiculous thing the franchise has done but the chemistry those two have together makes it so entertaining. The franchise keeps the heart of old for the family & it's wonderful to watch. Letty & Dom share a few nice moments, which I love. The final scene is a really nice touch & I'm sure all fans of the franchise will appreciate it. There's a credit scene featuring Deckard Shaw that you should stay for!

FF series is getting more and more wild you could even call Dom a combination of Captain America and Wolverine. Specifically in this movie, aside from the science behind electro-magnets and space travelling, the film still did a poor job adding on characters to the series: Han's revive didn't affect the plot that much, and Jakob's motive to revenge Dom has been quite confusing the whole time.

It seems like they took all the memes about the saga on social media and drove them right in this film. The movie showcases normal human beings doing supernatural things! Are we watching G. I Joe or the Avengers? No we are not, this is simply not logical at all. Although the characters seem invincible, the film blatantly pokes fun at the over exaggeration.As far as the plot... the film chases emotional appeal by hitting the road with a flashback to Dom's dad. Yet as the film accelerates , I noticed there are so many moving parts that as the viewer I couldn't focus on what the films direction is. The anchor of the film is the concept of ""family"" which wasn't executed properly. That is a result of the amount of characters the forced plot, and unnecessary scenes! Why ... better yet how did they end up in space ?Of course there are some cinematic action scenes and Tyrese adds his comical element. But again logically speaking what heck!!!!Although fast 9 speeds through the plot and keeps switching lanes by adding over the top scenes , it is simply not enough to move the meter. If you are like me you are simply lost when it comes to this saga. You can skip out on this one. And for my die hard Fast and Furious fans.... this is not for you.",F9 - The Fast Saga

If you're looking for a sophisticated film, this isn't it. It's for action junkies and those of us who don't care how unrealistic the film can be most of the time. Vin and John Cena are awesome. I'm utterly shocked Vin hasn't won an academy award for his acting. He puts a lot of effort into his roles and after Paul Walker passed away he really stepped his game up. We still have a long ways to go this year so movie of the year may have been a bit of a stretch however after you lay your eyes on this beautiful film you will probably start thinking movie of the year. I'm glad the Rock isn't in it. He really ruined the chemistry with the cast. Maybe he'll be in the last 2 but I definitely won't hold my breath.

232,h-62007-26888,Pure craziness at this point,7,29 June 2021,"Remember when this franchise was simply built on crime and the dated yet entertainingly colorful theme of street racing? Well, I hope you said goodbye, because that was clearly a LONG TIME AGO.At this point, the whole franchise has gone from entertainingly fast to expect the unexpected with how insane some of these moments are. Don't get me wrong, the action scenes themselves are fantastic and several fight scenes are the highlights of the movie. It's just that the main issue with them is that most of them are just...fantastical. Like, this is set in the modern world and it ends up having the same sense as something from THE AVENGERS. Think about it, they send cars up into OUTER SPACE, they're able to front flip giant tanker trucks onto their sides, the weapons used are magnets that can pretty much destroy anything, and there's this whole thing with SWINGING from the rope of a bridge like TARZAN. Because apparently, if this franchise taught me anything important, it's that they know EXACTLY how to ensure audiences suspend their disbelief.But this is just the entertainment value. What about the story? What is this installment about? Well, in this film, Dom is retired and trying to raise his son Brian (yes, it's what you think) with his now wife Letty, but is then called back into action when a new device that can destroy the world ends up in the wrong hands. On the job, he discovers that one of their enemies is Jakob Toretto, his long-lost brother and the reason their father died when they were younger, thus forcing Dom to battle with his inner demons and ensure that he can make peace with his brother. In concept, this premise sounds awesome and like it holds so much potential to be a great continuation of the franchise. But if you ask me, in terms of execution, it came off as rather...weak. The biggest issue with the story is that it's very formulaic and despite all the crazy moments, most of the outcomes are kind of predictable where it can feel obvious on what they're trying to do. I know there are some awesome moments with the action that I already talked about with craziness, but this might not've been the best way for the issue to resolve itself. I say this because it does happen sometimes when certain parts of the plot are either pointless, poorly handled, or are just ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. But not everything about the story is bad. It does dive further into some character development and ring back some other moments from other installments to pay tribute, and there are plenty of heartfelt moments that are touching and might even get some audiences a bit teary-eyed.Another good thing this movie did was with how it wrote Toretto. Now that Jakob has returned, Dom finds himself haunted by his past and is now doing everything he can to hide it by being focused on the mission rather than to make peace with Jakob. Sure, some might not like Dom for this because he could seem rather selfish, but if you ask me, this works out well because we see Dom go through the development from fighting his demons to realizing what really happened and how most of his actions have consequences. By his side include Ramsey, who's still the hacker we know her today, Roman and Tej, who despite my initial worries, are actually well-needed comic reliefs, and Letty, who unfortunately ended up as the weakest of the bunch with her only trait just being emotional support for Dom. But hey! She's got a lit haircut! I'm sure that's a new image for Michelle Rodriguez movie nuts can't get enough of. I'd talk more about the other characters, but they are relatively mixed. Some are well-written like Jakob, others aren't really that great and are only there for an obstacle like Cipher and Otto, and there are a few that only show up just for a cameo like Nobody. That, and some of the characters could go into spoiler territory. All I will say about them is that once again, they are led by a great cast that did a fantastic job with their performances.This is basically the ninth installment of the Fast and Furious franchise. If you ask me, watch it once you want to see what insanity levels look like in a racing movie. Otherwise, this is only for fans of the franchise on its own. Actually scratch that. The Fast and Furious franchise is a franchise no more. Now it has walked into Star Wars territory as a SAGA!",F9 - The Fast Saga

I knew it would be sillier and I've accepted, and grown to like what these movies have become. Charlize Theron was solid (and I'm convinced that she's incapable of giving a bad performance), Vin Diesel was Vin Diesel, everyone did exactly what you expect them to, Nathalie Emmanuel disappoints me with how she's stooped to this low, and the marketing disapponted me with how much of the action (and plot) they gave away.On one hand, Cardi B got as much screen time as Jason Statham, which should never be a sentence I have to say. On the other hand, we got to see Jason Statham beat up some guy he trapped in a punching bag, so that makes it a little better.I guess the moral of the story is that Jason Statham automatically makes anything he's in 10% better, even if it's only in the end credit scene.Also, I personally liked that the Rock wasn't in this one. He gets to be almost insufferable over the span of a whole movie. He's not nearly as funny as he thinks he is, but since he is...well, the Rock, in both status and stature, nobody will tell him that.",F9 - The Fast Saga

I agree with most of the crappy ratings but I do think it's still an entertaining movie.I was laughing so hard just 20 minutes in, looking at how fake and unrealistic it was, but then what else would you expect from a fast and furious movie these days. After seeing the previous two movies, nothing surprised me, not even the illogical stunts they pulled. Though they overdid themselves this time, you really need to shut your brain off to enjoy this one because they've turned a racing movie into a superhero movie now. Almost nothing makes sense in the plot or the science behind the action sequences.",F9 - The Fast Saga

But in 2021 alone, this is by far the best movie I've seen. I have been let down by too many highly anticipated movies this year, that's why I have to give F9 a 10/10. Have to admit though, some scenes were a little strange, awkward and redundant, but at least there isn't anything that seems to be an annoying factor. Plus, story wise, I like the idea of the huge magnet and the idea of bringing back Han & Mia. Their car racing stunts are still as exciting as usual. Love it!",F9 - The Fast Saga

247,thechair,A Trudge,2,27 June 2021,"Trust me, I went into this film hoping to enjoy it. Since the franchise peak of Fast Five the series had plateaued to some degree. The action was getting bigger but the awful dialogue, Vin Diesel's hopeless, misplaced sincerity and generally bad acting were only being balanced by fun appearances by The Rock and The Stath. Bigger action, silly, fun stunts, awful acting, terrible dialogue, fun additional characters like The Rock and The Stath. Unfortunately with this installment we are only treated to the negative half of that equation. It's a Trudge. A laboured slog through action scenes I'd now seen much better versions of, boring, boring exposition and hokey, lengthy flashback sequences. Just no fun at all. Zero. I won't go and see another.

250,moviematthewh-60783,Awful writing,3,19 June 2021,"We do not need this movie as well as Fast 8. This movie was just unnecessary, I could not care less about what happened to the characters. The writing for the characters were so shallow, if something happened which was somewhat intense or risk taking, I could not care about what would a happen to them because there was no depth to the characters. The addition of Doms brother was so useless and made no addition to the story or characters in my opinion. He didn't seem like the threat the trailers made him out to be and that was also due to the ending The ending was very predicative, so I just got so tired of the movie about 3/4 of the way in. The series should of just ended with 7. Not because that Paul walker had passed away but because the way the 7th film ended was perfect for a series. The addition of 8 and 9 made no impact to the characters and their lives at all. Only things I enjoyed were a few action scenes and cinematography was good in some scenes as well. Overall, just bad, forgettable but predicable writing with bad character development and a dragging story.",F9 - The Fast Saga

After that, it was pretty much the same ole l same ole. Then it got a little bit ridiculous with some of the action scenes. Look, we all come to enjoy the characters in fast and furious and we each have a favorite. For them to make two more is like watching a bowl of ice cream after it's been eaten.

I cannot remember when this franchise took a turn to the ""we are superhero's that drive nice cars"" phase they are currently in, but my god how I wish it would end. Movie was enjoyable. A lot of reference from the first movie (happy 20th anniversary I guess). They brought some of the Tokyo drift characters back. That was kind of interesting, but the cherry on top was that these mofos went to goddamn space. Yes ladies and gents outer space. Tej and Roman end up going to space wearing diving suits. Yes.

However, this instalment is probably the silliest one yet and it makes for some phenomenaly exciting action sequences if you're willing to suspend your disbelief. The cast continue to shine as their characters, with Tyrese Gibson being particularly enjoyable this time round, almost as an audience substitute, questioning the movie's logic. However, while it obviously isn't what we're here for, the story is terrible. It relies on major retcons to the events of previous movies, as well as retconning the backstory of Toretto, all of which are incredibly convoluted. However, at this point, all we're hear for is to watch cars crash into each other and in that respect this film delivers and more. I recommend seeing this if you're a fan of the franchise or just a fan of dumb action movies.",F9 - The Fast Saga

We knew such gems never obeyed the physical laws of mechanics, but now even the sky is no longer the limit for the Immortals of F&F - even electromagnetism and space itself is no longer immune from their hijinks. Our intrepid protagonists' biologies render them not only impervious to shrapnel, bullets, knifes, broken glass, kicks, punches, but somehow rather endow them with the superhuman strength and intellect that only the genius possess and the insane lament. With F9, we have reached a dimension even Austin Powers would have trouble comprehending. Wait, reached? Hell, blew right past.This is not your usual explosion and bullet filled campy actioneer, where every bullet misses, cars rolled and crushed like blunts don't bruise the heroes, missiles create harmless explosions; this is something else entirely. Still don't know how exactly to describe the unholy mess I just witnessed, mouth agape, brain still trying to make sense of it.

The amount of crap they put in the movie to try to make it more appealing is astonishing. Everyone of the ""crew"" is basically bulletproof, cars ignore all laws of physics, and took them 9 movies to mention Toretto has a brother?

They were still using their racing skills but at the same time bringing their other talents to the table.However, they started to go too far with the insanely impossible stunts and just throwing reality completely out of the window. This is when the franchise lost me.This movie was just plain stupid. Driving a car into what was once a cable bridge in such a way that the cable connects to the bumper and swing across a canyon like tarzan and somehow releasing the cable once they were on the other side?Putting rockets on a Pontiac Fiero and flying into space wearing scuba suits?Guy being shot with multiple machine guns which put holes in his shirt but not him? He even comments that this is insane. Yeah, it is.Bringing old friends back to life crap.The stupid crap that they did with electromagnets was just moronic.Yeah, my brother tried to take over the world, but forgive him at the end of the movie because, you know...he's my brother.I hope they go back to their roots if another movie is made.

Yet again the action sequences and mostly unidentifiable usage of CGI/VFX sequences are the most praiseworthy thing this time. Coming to performances, every family member is given their own moments to cherish as the film progresses. Personal favourite was none other than Roman, Tej, Ramsey trio. Surprise cameos and post credits is yetw another factor to watch out in this movie that elevates it here and there. Last but not the least the light hearted moments somehow succeed in providing the flick the heart it has.Although F9 is 0.2 x better than its predecessor things doesn't elevate much as expected. The plot that has been used over hollywood for years felt too generic. F9 felt too much lengthy and dull at times that alienates the movie from the audience. Promising John Cena's role is sidelined as the story progresses which too felt disappointing. Unwanted reveal of the surprise return through advertisements only helps in ruining one of the major parts of the film.In the end, F9 from Fast Franchise tries to find its way up to the top but gets caught up in the wave of below average to average level due to numerous factors.Rating:57%",F9 - The Fast Saga

I mean that scene where Ludacris and Tyrese taking out the satellite with funny space outfits completely sucked, it was too much of an over exaggeration .. so it drops down to 7.2 . As a rating . And when Cypher and the others turn on Jacob .. and the Furious gang gets to know of it all of a sudden in the middle of the road with the action going on .. with no monologing subjectivity , that's pretty much stupid .

The size of your head, jaw size and shape can totally change naturally after your are 18+.3. You can catch people with flying cars, by shoving cars. And totally nothing will happen to them.4. You can drown and the whole building will crash on you. And 2 minutes later you are saved somehow.5. Most of the bad guys in Fast and furious can turn good guys for the next installment.6. You can be dead in real life and still take care of the kids and be late for a dinner.7. You can launch a car into space on 2 rockets and nothing will happen to it.8. You can crash a satellite with a car and still nothing happens to it.9. You can be shot by multiple auto rifles and nothing will happen to you. It's enough you are running and holding your head down.A minute later you can just pick up a gun and shoot all the bad guys that were too blind to shoot you.10. You can drive on a crumbling bridge, even though its already crumbling and nothing to hold the huge weight of the car. Basically its a flying car but who's checking.A probably could find more stupid moments in this movie. Like lame jokes that dont work. Or a lame reference to Star wars that ain't funny.Basically the people in this movie are invulnerable like super heroes from a comics movie. Just it doesnt make any sense. There is a lot of cgi that looks really bad when they jump on cars, building and what not. The plot is boring and unoriginal.

278,elvylanda,Cheesy Yet Still Fun.,8,31 May 2021,"Well, Fast 9 finally debuts in theaters after being delayed for a year due to the Covid 19 pandemic. The past couple of Fast and Furious films have been very confusing and absurd in storylines due to director Justin Lin not being behind the camera directing and not having the late Paul Walker anymore.But Justin Lin is back for F9 and he tries to connect the storylines from the previous Fast and Furious films into a cohesive film for F9. Since Justin Lin is back at the helm, it means the return of one of his favorite actors / characters from Tokyo Drift. In fact, there are a few characters from Tokyo Drift that make an appearance in F9. Amazing how Lin has gotten the most out of a film like Tokyo Drift that - not being commercially successful and only average reviews - paved the way for the rest of the Fast and Furious universe for years to come.Well, with F9, Lin tries to connect the absurdity of the storylines from the previous films where Dominic and company are subcontracted agents for the government of sorts. And he does it by giving you a backstory to Dominic which goes back to his teenage years along with a younger brother named Jakob (played by John Cena). And this prequel of sorts, he gives you a perspective of the Dom character, the relationship with his younger brother and what went wrong and why they remained apart which leads into the main plot of the story as Jakob is rogue / bad guy working for a previous enemy that killed the mother of Dom's son. And that is your basic plot for the film which is brother vs brother.Now, you don't watch Fast and Furious for the acting and storylines. You watch it for the action and F9 has plenty of action with car chases, explosions, crashes and all around excitement which is the nook and cranny of every Fast and Furious film and F9 gives you plenty of an adrenaline to rush as a viewer.I liked F9. Cheesy but always fun and to the people that keep complaining about the franchise, when people stop paying money to watch the films, they'll stop making it.

Putting that aside, the calibre of acting should be studied for all the wrong reasons. Was this done so on purpose? It was reminiscent of the Bold and the Beautiful, staring into space as the camera pans and dramatic music plays. There was no story other than people being brought back from the dead, inconceivable plot holes and irrelevant flashbacks. I was hoping for a decent action flick with humour and at least a interesting story. The other bonus was the movie was so loud no one could hear me passing gas all the way through.",F9 - The Fast Saga
280,azeezsmith-61542,F9 Review- A NEAR FAST SEQUEL,8,9 October 2021,"F9 Is A Fast Perfect Sequel That Takes The Franchise Even More Bigger Than Ever Before With Family By Your Side. I Love The Fast And Furious Franchise, But This Sequel Manages To Deliver With Tons Of Cool Car Action Scenes, Magnets And A Team Up Squad To Save The Day. Love The Action Scenes, Crazy Magnets That Are Used Well. The Cast Was Good And REALLY GLAD THAT THEY GOT THEIR SCREEN TIME. Lots Of Cool Cameos. 2hr Hours That Are Perfectly Enough To Fit The Fast Title. Loved Seeing Dom And Crew Again And John Cena Is A BEAST. Hans's Return Was Believable And Explained Well. Cypher Was Underused. I Loved That This Sequel Brings The Family Together And Has Its Good Moments And A Franchise That Owns The Family Title Till This Day. Plot Was Decent, The Music Was FIRE. Trailers Gave Away Too Much. Justin Lin's Good Directing And Skills And A Sequel That Definitely Is Not Really One Of He's Best Ones. STAY FOR THE END CREDITS ESPECIALLY!!I Had A Crazy Fun Time With F9 And Even = Excited For 10 And 11. If You Are A Fast And Furious Fan, Then You'll Definitely Have A Fun Time With F9. NEEDS TO BE EXPERIENCED ON THE BIG SCREEN. REALLY AMDE FOR THEATERS!!",F9 - The Fast Saga

I can honestly say that this was the most painful one, achieving a whole new level of bad. Who funds this garbage? Does anyone actually read the script first? Why do they keep giving Vin Diesel work when he's arguably one of the worst actors ever? So many questions, so many illogical decisions. Someone, somewhere thought it was a brilliant idea to make 9 of them. I can only pray there isn't a 10th otherwise a divorce may be in the cards!",F9 - The Fast Saga

Sadly it made back $700 million.None of these movies have been particularly good, however the first one was a curious, and interesting plot. Some car thieves got involved in some crime. Fast cars pretty girls some stunts and it was all over. How on earth we have gotten to a point where there is something like 10 movies related to the original plot is beyond me. There are starving people in the world and this amount of money could have been so much better spent. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. They should wake up in the morning and feel disgusted at what a waste of money this movie was. They could have done so very much with this amount of money. You could've fundamentally change the course of a country with this amount of money. You could've lifted a nation from poverty to the first world with this amount of money.I'm sorry but everyone involved in this should absolutely feel a blot on their conscience and deeply embarrassed and disgraced with how appalling this movie is. Nothing about this movie justify spending $200 million on 2 1/2 hours of very low grade entertainment.Many people will say oh it's just a car chase movie with a bit of action. I'm sorry but it is not that. This represents the waste of effort and waste of energy and the employment of so few for so much money. Everyone should feel very ashamed and very embarrassed.",F9 - The Fast Saga

And now there's a brother??What next, will the next movie show Van Diesel's mother was actually Wonder Woman, and his father really did not die in the car crash but was transported to another dimension.This was not Fast and it was not Furious , it was an embarrasment.",F9 - The Fast Saga

From jumping off a cliff and harpooning the other side to swing the car up to the road, to flying off another cliff and being picked up by a passing jet this groan of a movie still had just enough to hold my attention until..they ventured into outer space.

If you watch closely you can see the boot 'wiggle' when he steps, like any lady wearing high heels.Beyond unrealistic, Vin is 'strongest one there is', except when it comes to punching Cena, who after being punched by Vin in the face/head repeatedly has not a hair out of place.Um, if Vin punches you in the face, you are going to look like it.The term 'phoned in' definitely describes this.It is still sweet that they leave a chair open for Paul Walker's character even though the actor has passed.",F9 - The Fast Saga

It is like it was written by a kid who read only one comic book then said ""I can do that"": no training, no technique, no logic. Comics are based in reality with a supernatural element and this movie was like a comic. I did see the story, the intent, the lines to pull from the other movies, the reason this movie tied the others together. And Tysons character keeps saying ""like we are indestructible"" to mirror how ridiculous this is. I enjoyed it because it was total unrealistic bull, like a few of the Fast movies. I was totally in on the series till outright impossible stunts then it became the joke it is: the true stereotype of all action movies ""no character development, smash and grab, there's a bad guy so go get revenge"".

291,mayankfriend,Unrealistic this time,5,1 August 2021,"An awaited flick of 2021, which disappoint in most of the every aspect. Script was fine, most of the stunts were a bit unrealistic, although people won't mind b'coz that's the only quality of being an FnF fan. Script was OK, starcast on the other hand, won't excite you much - John Cena as a wrestler he's good but as an actor he won't make much impact liked his senior ""the Rock"", when he on boarded first time in FAST series. Seeing him in action with Vin Diesel- was refreshing experience. Then Statham comes- the whole game changed to a NEXT level. Both duo- Statham n Rock, takes the FnF series a new level. Now F9, won't make much impact by introducing -Cena. Few scenes were good n you were actually looking forward to it, when Han came, second when Cipher came with a new Bob hair cut 😉 looking as stunning in the previous one, third when Quinne come. Apart from it, movie doesn't give you any exciting thing. Ludacris n Tyler Gibson were also good. Nathalie Emanuel should just stick to the computer geek act, comedy is not her cup of Michelle Rodriguez is as usually like VinDiesel we can't expect her in any other movie. You'll get the relief - when you see the ""actor"", which you wanted to see in the ""END"".Watch this movie, only for being the FnF fan .",F9 - The Fast Saga
292,frankie-08908,What Did I Just Spend Money To Watch...,1,26 June 2021,"...A ""C"" movie at best. It was just really really bad. I know the difference between going to see a movie that's a popcorn flick and an Oscar contender. I'm willing to set reality aside and enjoy the popcorn flick. This movie is just way over the top bad. With all the money and popularity this franchise has earned the expectations of great CGI, decent but fun acting is understandable. What's not understandable is how they ruined the entire movie with horrible CGI, horrible acting, endless plot holes, confusing editing, locations that look fake (were they really in Tokyo?) Most of us are willing to understand many stunts are too dangerous so there's safety measures and CGI to help. The stunts here were so fake they looked cartoonish. There is so much bad I could go on forever, but I'll end it with the embarrassing Cena. His face looks fake (is there something wrong with his face, plastic surgery, too much makeup I don't know), the way he stands is weird, even his posture looks forced, zero acting ability, and the disrespectful, unpatriotic sucking up apology he made to China was a slap in the face of every American. He is so bad it's delirious. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Wait until it's on tv to witness trash.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Okay, that's wonderful; you can save the world; however, how can someone reach space in his car and survive?Seriously?I don't recall this being fast and furious. The plot was similar to earlier films and revolved around Hobbs and Shaw. The story was not exceptional in any way.And, when it comes to action, it was unrealistic and unbelievable.Thousands of cars followed Dom's crew, and thousands of guys with bullets and automatic weapons fired at them, but nothing happened to them. No one was hurt in any way. Are they immortals?I felt the absence of screenwriter Chris Morgan as the structure and storytelling were sloppier to the overall detriment of the film.",F9 - The Fast Saga

It is absolutely stupid which i would be fine with if it didn't take itself so seriously with all these flashbacks about doms life and Han resurrection and taking it deadly serious where instead of fun it's just really boring (plus the actors can NOT do drama). On top of that the action isn't good (ruined by shaky cam or terrible cgi), characters that are invincible so I don't care what happens and there is no tension, awful acting (wasted like Charlize Theron or Kurt Russell or can't act/do drama at all like vin diesel), the story.....what story it's just very very very thin threads to connect action with something kinda resembling a plot, a million holes and stupid moments, and there are so many stupid moments in its 2h 25m runtime so it gets boring (and btw this film is WAY TO LONG).

298,ryanwesthamfan,Not As Bad As People Say,7,24 June 2021,"The Good- All The action sequences are as great as always, that is something that you've come to expect from this franchise. This franchise depends heavily on the heat and family themes and although the previous film wasn't awful it did lack that soul, and in this one it still has them values and a lot of that is what they did with Dom's past. John Cena was fine in this film he wasn't a massive addition to the franchise but I did like what they did with his character and with Dom.The Mixed- This is one of them films where if you don't turn your brain off and disregard any logic you will not enjoy it.The Bad- The story isn't that great. There is a sequence in the final act which is so stupid even if you turn your brain off you still sat there thinking why are they doing this.Overall Thoughts- Although it's not the worst film of the franchise F9 is definitely wild. Overall I'm going to give ""F9"" a 7/10 and if you're a fan of the franchise definitely check it out but with reasonable expectations.",F9 - The Fast Saga

301,zwashington-32756,More Mature Storytelling From Wall-To-Wall Action Blockbuster,8,8 July 2021,"F9: The Fast Saga is one of the final installments of the action-packed, family drama, street racing films that we've come to know and love.Movie synopsis: The film follows Dom and his crew on their mission to stop a catastrophic weapon from ending up in the hands of highly-skilled assassin and Dom's brother, Jakob Toretto. If you've been watching the FF franchise for some time now, you'll know that these films usually run off of plot convenience. The dialogue is never as clever as the writers think it is and the storylines are always tied to some muddled family drama that results in a suicide mission, mindless action, and epic street racing. This franchise is BUILT on it's clichés and the theory that these characters are practically invincible. Any viewer that criticizes the film for being nonsensical is clearly a foreigner to the series. That being said, I did enjoy the film. It was refreshing to see a lot of familiar faces and some new ones. We also got to see a lot of Roman Pearce comeuppance 😂 and some interesting character arcs from the rest of the crew. In fact, I felt that this installment was more mature than its predecessors with more sophisticated action, nicely executed flashbacks, and impressive special effects. Though some of the film's action violence could have benefited from an 'R' rating, it was clear that writers and producers attempted quite a lot of fan service regarding the quality of the past FF film's storylines. A lot of this was done by making the stakes even more bizarre than usual, and by poking fun at the risky missions that the apparent immortals are made to go on. Other than a criminally underused Charlize Theron, I don't have many problems with this film. It's exactly what you would expect from a Fast and Furious film in a GOOD WAY. Fans of the series will be delighted. Haters of the series, may or may not be swayed. 78%",F9 - The Fast Saga

We all know the stunts are done by professionals and are put together in the editing room and in real life the drivers would be either killed or badly injured, but it ""used"" to be done so well that your mind sorta went with the flow and you believed it. Sort of. But this latest film I have go to say is dire. Gunmen with automatic rifles spraying lead at a man who is about 20-30 feet in front of them and not hitting him once? Travelling through a town, again automatic weapons fire and vehicles getting smashed left right and centre yet no one, not even stand byers getting injured? BUT, the best is left to last....

Well alrighty then.

I really enjoy these movies because I know they don't just half ass these movies. They put heart into making these movies and also they make em for us fans. So if you enjoy the Fast and Furious movies go out and see this! You won't be disappointed. It's better than 8 that's for sure.",F9 - The Fast Saga

331,supergye,Franchise Gives Us What We Really Want,8,12 July 2021,"The story was not as important as the absurd stunts. The franchise delivers another heavy serving of physics defying chases in survival that even Captain America would say WTF. At one point Tyrese character Roman recognizes this immortal aspect of the group, which quite frankly let's the audience in on the whole joke. They can make fun of themselves and that's a good thing.We really know why we are watching this. If the franchise wanted better writing they could make Shakespeare on wheels. They have the dough to do anything they want. But that's not what the people want. The Studio has made billions on this type of action story so why change it?I have to give a nod to actor Vinnie Bennet who plays the younger Dom (Vin Diesel). His performance was absolutely riveting. Rarely do I see perfection in acting. His piercing eyes and ability to convey emotions thru to the audience may have eclipsed his protégé of psychic apparatus- Diesel. In my opinion, this rarely happens in cinema. I hope his career continues to grow.These touching moments that came thru from the younger Dom we witness later, a tie in to his more mature self. How does ones abandonment of a younger brother Jakob played by Cena, in his early years influence their maturity? For an action movie meant to mainly titillate the adrenaline glands and serotonin receptors, I have to give them points for this exploration. The scene where the older Dom, in a state of unconsciousness, sees his father without the rose colored glasss. Nobody is perfect, everyone is flawed. Some more than others. Yes, it ends up a bit crazy, but super interesting to me in this universe.One Spoiler worth mentioning...Why on earth does Jakob get a complete pass at the end? He is basically a Bin Laden on steroids who gets kicked out of the bad guy's team. Then, and only then does he turn good. Which the team picks up on immediately by what seems like magic. The team decides to let him go. Second chances seem to be the theme of this movie even if it means apocalypse type crimes.",F9 - The Fast Saga

What I really liked and what really surprised here was the way they totally leaned into the sheer ridiculousness of it all.There's not even an effort to be realistic here. At this point the cast and crew are as aware as the audience of how absurd these movies have become so in this one they just say ""To hell with it"" and just go for it. There are Meta jokes , fieros in space and no one where's seat belts except for Ramsey, which is a meta joke itself.By dropping the seriousness the crew ends up leaning into the fun of the whole thing.

They leave the kid behind to go on a quest? Who is watching the child? I was able to justify it by pretending he dropped the kid off at his sister. But NO, his sister Mia finds them in their lair (how did she just know where they were???? & who is watching their kids??? Who would they trust enough to raise them because people die on these missions.Ok, kids aside, l think they've run out of realistic looking tricks. At one point they have a car driving across a rope bridge and then they are driving straight up a vertical rope bridge ... what about GRAVITY??? Or the strength of a bumper.

I don't think I'll ever be able to drink enough to erase this atrocity from my memory. Anyway, I'm gonna go take a shower now and see if I can wash the stench of this movie off of me.

342,mcummings-89092,So so bad,2,15 August 2021,"The first movie is fun perhaps even a cult classic that happened to make a lot of money on a modest budget. The next few movies were forgettable relative flops only for 5-7 to turn it around with some good enjoyable films, then somehow we end up here. I thought 8 was generally very forgettable but this is the opposite simply because it's so bad.A movie that started off as cops and robbers with some fast cars thrown in somehow sees all the characters as trained elite fighters with and without weapons. They regularly evade the laws of physics, travel around the world and source fast cars. You can sort of switch your brain off for some it but the plot of the film is even worse then there is no consistency with earlier films. Oh and try to forget that most of the cast have noticeably aged (vin diesal somehow less so) and look way out of place in these films.In hindsight they should have ended this when Paul Walker tragically died but money talked and now we have this travesty of a movie. My only hope is it sucks so badly they give up on the idea of a tenth movie.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Through all the collisions, fires, explosions and all the rest it remains perfectly white without a stain or a smudge on it. Nothing you see is real, it is more unrealistic than any comic book or fantasy film and if this franchise did not make huge bank in China it would have died long ago.And screw that magnet Justin Lin is to logic and physics what Deepak Chopra is to quantum mechanics.",F9 - The Fast Saga
348,crom-dubh,Disappointing,6,26 October 2021,"I say ""disappointing"" but I kind of knew I was going to be disappointed. My rating of 6/10 is probably generous because of my love of the series and finding it difficult to rate it lower. In my opinion, they really should have stopped with the 7th film. ""Fate..."" was mostly entertaining but you could see where things were headed, which is to say that while the 7th film definitely had some ridiculous physics-defying moments, they worked cinematically and felt exhilarating, whereas from that point on things just started feeling like they were intentionally trying to one-up themselves all the time and often in ways that felt really pointless. The problems the writers have had to deal with (in particular how to get around the fact that Brian is supposedly still alive but can't be in any of the movies) becomes more clumsy with each film.But ultimately the reason I feel this installment is so weak is that it was ... kind of boring. And this goes back to my earlier point about the film's attempt to one-up itself all the time. Forget that nothing that happens makes sense according to physics, but most of the stuff that happens here just doesn't feel like it makes sense in the movie. The first action sequence has a car driving over a collapsing bridge. That was kind of boilerplate F&F material, but then it needs to be superseded by a car miraculously attaching itself mid-jump to a giant cable from that bridge and swinging halfway around an island outcropping to crash safely on a narrow strip of road. It felt like nothing in the film was actually planned in advance, they just write it all in one draft and constantly had to invent crazy dumb sh** to bail themselves out of whatever situations they had written the characters into. By comparison, in the 7th film, I mostly felt like no matter how ridiculous things got, the stakes felt high. There was cinematic tension. Here, it felt like I didn't really care what happened because I knew some stunt would see them through. They even literally address this in a piece of dialog about probably being invincible.All of it is just so arbitrary. They invent one family member who's never been mentioned in the course of 8 movies about family, and bring back one character who was supposed to be dead because... fan service, I guess? The cast's chemistry, which was always one of the things that anchored these movies, wasn't even working in their favor half the time because everyone was split up mostly doing their own thing, with a few exceptions. It's sad that they have decided to take the franchise in this direction. I wonder if Paul hadn't died if they would have managed to keep things on track and not completely lose track of what made this series special. I am a big fan and actually love all the movies up through 7 (well... maybe ""love"" is a little strong for Tokyo Drift). At this point they're just kinda going through the motions.",F9 - The Fast Saga

350,alex-799-908199,well,4,4 July 2021,They certainly had ideas and making it into a film was never second guessed.From fast 4 till now the plot has been. A secret organisation is out to use a very dangerous tool to wipe a person out or take over country's. This one did all that and more. A so secret group that not even the secret secret organisations knew of.This had too many plot wholes and ideas that they wanted to explore. The fact that they sent out 2 people in a very old car into space basically raised the bar for stupidity and realism. And they blew up a satellite and survived proved it.The Tokyo guys entry into this was so out of place and not needed for the idea to go into space but they threw it in just it be added.Minefield chase was another odd set. The bad guys vehicles blew up on contact but never the hero's. They bounced around setting it up. Dom took on 50 plus guys and pulled down some foundations to wake up without a scratch or wound. He also lunged a car off a cliff to roll 5 times to sustain no injures .The film was a one hit watch.

The more conservative viewership may not like the extreme scenes, but after 20 years this franchise has dealt with all the earthly scenarios they could have imagined for a movie.Is it realistic that our lead characters are able to survive a number of crashes, explosions, shootings and environments adverse to human health? No, of course not. This one is a fictional script and not about a bunch of car enthusiasts who steal DVD players so they can pay for a car meet in the desert.But it nevertheless gives us enough entertainment to keep us interested.

Terrible slow-mo and special effects that are so OTT they look lov-budget-false even mid scene.I could go on, but I won't.I usually enjoy this brain dead action franchise but this was so bad it was insulting.We sat watching it and were more amused by pulling it apart while we watched than what the actual film was saying.I have no idea how much they spent making this (the effects and destruction must have cost a fortune) but I cannot imagine it earning enough to cover the cast lunch bills.They all look so old and worn out.

Not because he was wrong all along, but because he needed a car and needed Dom and his team to avoid being killed! Would Dom just say 'oh well, its all good'?On top of that, where TF did they magically find a car laying around that was prepped for space travel? Like really! If they had been working on a car that could venture into space, yes i'd totally get that BUT this is not the case! There was just magically a space car available! RUBBISH!",F9 - The Fast Saga

-The action is just too over the top and unrealistic. I don't know if they do it on purpose but come on, fully trained soldiers shooting an unarmed guy 10 metres away and missing every shot is a bit much
-Very unrealistic moments and over the top moments which will upset a lot of people
-Not a fan of bringing back Han, i feel its a little pointless. It feels like they did it to make another spin off movie with him
-What the hell happened to Mr Nobody?! They completely forget he exists which really annoyed mePositives:
-As usual with these movies, a lot of entertaining moments throughout
-The beginning was very good
-I loved what they did with the flashbacks

The self referencial, meta humor makes it a parody. Struggle to care about any of the characters because we know they are safe. The 9th film, and they took away the wrong lessons.

Suddenly, Dom has a brother? OK, fine! Why does he think he was living in his brother's shadow? Because someone said ""You're the useless one""? That's it? Why did Dom, the guy that uses the word ""family"" every 5 seconds is so easy to believe that Jakob killed their father? Why does Jakob suddenly turn good? Because his partner betrayed him? Why did Dom suddenly forgive Jakob? Because of a series of flashbacks that reveal nothing new? Why did Otto decide to take sides with Cipher? What did she have to offer to him? As a matter of fact, what did Jakob offered to him?The next insult is the story and the dialogues. I was getting a headache by some of the dialogues regarding family. What a nonsensical way to bring back Han! Using magnets in the way depicted in the movie was unbelievable even for a comic book movie. Driving to outer space? Why??! Every character in this movie should be recruited by the Avengers! As Roman stated in the movie, they are all invincible. Finally, Why did everyone get involved in the story at all?

Storyline....it was so weak and tried so hard that it measured up to a weak cup of tea compared to the mocca that first few movies was. There was not real ""feel"" to the way the story evolved, it was more like add this and add that and patch it together.In the end, it is an action movie and action there was a lot of, and humor, that is why it is 3 stars and not 1 starConclution: It was not worth the 15 euros to see it, and the movie makers are ruining the spirit of the Fast stories, they sell out to action cause of action part rather than go with a thick and actionfilled storyline, it feels rushed and it feels as if there is no soul in this.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Dominic is a straight I don't even know anymore. He's not human. He's superman. Its like he became Super Hobbs. Superman without the special abilities but definitely invincible, can't die, nothing can happen to this guy. So its like why would you care if he gets in a wreck? If he has to fight 50 soldiers, if a building collapses underneath him? You know he's going to wind up walking away from it without even a scratch. I mean even just a scratch would be like whoa... he can get hurt. And that's not even mentioning the fact... they went in space. They go to space. A car is driving in space because some guys are now rocket scientists... and ""numbers don't lie."" Its a ridiculous entry. And that's not even touching on the super heavy duty magnets INSIDE the car but doesn't effect the car that it is inside but instead effects cars at certain times, or cell phones, or light posts or a big ... tank thing? I don't know.Point is if this seems confusing... welcome to F9 The Fast Saga. If anything this will come off more coherent and make more sense than the movie.

442,chloeurc,The fast family isn't going anywhere,7,27 June 2021,"F9 review
Some spoilersPros:
The Fast Family is forever! The Fast and Furious franchise has always been centered around family and love and it doesn't end in this film. The characters and their love for each other is the heart of this film as it has been in the last 9 films as well. Brian O'Connor played by the late Paul Walker is not ignored but remembered, mentioned, honored and still apart of this franchise even after his passing. They also add in their faith in God, which is so refreshing to still see in movies today.Finally some back story! In this film you see the life Dom had before he meets his crew. You meet his family members as well as take a history lesson into his teenage life prior to the first film. It is always great to see some origin stories of a main character so the audience can dive even more into the life of Dom and his brother. Also, you may have noticed in the trailer that a character named Han comes back to life. In this movie they explain the backstory on that as well.Female characters are more respected! If you have seen the Fast and Furious movies you will know that there are many scenes of girls at parties or races wearing practically nothing, shaking their body parts while the camera doesn't bother to show you who you are even looking at. They are nobodies. This film does not do that. They wear dresses and pants like normal women and have better things to do. The main female characters Mia, Letty, Ramsey and a new girl Elle help drive, kick butt and provide assistance in getting the mission done without making them naked or manly in any way.Cons:
Bigger isn't always better! Since there are now nine movies the cast and writers have to keep the audience entertained. But making things more and more outrageous and crazy in terms of the plot and what these characters can do sometimes can take away from the story. In this movie that happens. There are scenes that are way over the top and ridiculous but then again we know this isn't a documentary.It's a long movie! The runtime of this movie is 2 hours and 25 minutes. This is the longest Fast and Furious movie to date. Not sure why it is the longest one either. There are scenes that could of been cut shorter.The family seems to be getting smaller? In Fast 5 (2011) there are at least 10 or 11 main characters but in this film there are maybe 7 or 8. Maybe it was just me but it felt like the fast family is shrinking. They are probably too late in the game when it comes to adding more characters to the family since they may be ending the franchise with the 10th movie but they kind of need to.All in all it wasn't bad, the Fast Family lives on!7/10.",F9 - The Fast Saga

The whole idea of these movies is to be ridiculous and to push the boundaries of suspension of disbelief.Yes, the science and physics in this movie are absurd.

And I'm here for it😂,10,28 June 2021,Remember when these movies were about racing LOL it's like they had a bunch of 15-year-old boys who drink nothing but monster energy drinks for a week straight write the script for this. It's entertaining if you're going for a movie that supposed to be Oscar worthy do not see this LOL. All I'm gonna say is they literally go out to space like what!?!There is without a doubt definitely going to be a 10th one and I'm definitely going to see it as I've seen every other movie in this franchise and loved every last one of them.

450,pasanjayasinghe,A real showpiece with a truly engaging storyline and Oscar worthy acting.,3,31 July 2021,"No. It's just not. I'm sorry I just headline-baited you.At this point, many of us walk in to a Fast & Furious movie with very low expectations anyway. It's the kind of movie you watch to just ease off. Nice cars, fast paced, action packed, stunt heavy and the classic dumbed down hero/villain story. This has been the Fast and Furious formula for over a decade now. While it definitely seems to be getting old, it still works (kind of) and hey, it's not a bad thing to still have movies like this around. Especially in this day and age where pretty much everything on screen is pushing some form of a political agenda. So, if you're that OG fan who still walks in to a Fast & Furious movie expecting an actual plot with a decent story like the first, third and fourth movies, well good for you. But you're definitely not going to find that here. Even the movie itself acknowledges this fact. So it's at least it's not the kind of film that try hard to be something that it's not. It just accepts what it is and delivers what the audience expects (At least most of us). Nothing more, nothing less.If you really want to know, the story, to simply put, is atrocious. There's no originality, no arcs, hilariously bad dialogue, numerous plot holes which even a 6-year-old can spot and it simply exists to supplement the action sequences. Not the other way around. Also be warned that if you're a fan of Tokyo Drift, this movie might potentially ruin that for you.It kind of shows that cast themselves are getting a bit tired of the repetitiveness and the milking of these stories and I too believe that it's about time they wrap this up after the 10th installment. Yes, there will be a 10th and it's not like I spoiled it anyway because everyone knew that before this movie was even announced.TLDR: It's just a very dumb movie with lazy writing and lot of CGI/stunt shots. But that's the exact point of it and if you still expect more of this franchise after all these years just don't waste your money and time on it.",F9 - The Fast Saga
451,Honodi,The Worst Movie in the Franchise by far.,3,9 August 2021,"I don't even really know what to say, this Movie is just so bad.The Story is not good, the Dialogues are horrible, and the cast at times feels like they are ""phoning"" it in.It lacks in every department and there is a line about how ridiculous a Story can be and still be entertaining. Unlike Movies like ""The Expendables"" (1-2) this movie did not only cross that line, but left it behind sa far , you can't even see it anymore.Cast wise , you can only have so many ""stone faced"" actors in a movie without others to offset the complete lack of facial expressions, a lesson this movie demonstrates but did not learn.There is hope that 10 will be better, but also a high chance that after 9 you won't be interested in seeing another Movie in this Franchise.",F9 - The Fast Saga

455,OwensDad1,This franchise needs to end,1,2 June 2021,"Have been a fan of a few of these movies in the series. And when it comes to Fast & the Furious, suspending disbelief has been necessary for awhile now. But this one, this is where it all goes south. Let's start with characters. Somehow everyone that exists in this universe is interconnected. They have to rewrite history and retcon almost everything to make it work. And, speaking of characters, why do the villains always have some redeemable quality at the end? They're never truly 'evil'. They're only evil until the next movie when it's revealed that they're less evil than the newest Big Bad to appear. Brian, Brian is relegated to a babysitter now? My god. Just kill the character off. All these others come back from the dead but the actor that really is dead somehow remains alive off screen?The set pieces have gotten beyond ridiculous. No one is ever bruised when a car jumps 500 feet across a ravine and flips 12 times. But get punched in the face by Don Toretto, and you're a bloody mess, scarred until the movie ends. Oh, and SPACE!! Seriously?These movies have become a vanity project for Vin Diesel to flex his muscles and show you what a 'man' he is. He somehow has to always get the beat down on the bigger, more muscular tough guy. They keep casting these big bulky ex wrestlers for him to beat down. I think Vin feels like this is all real. And that he really is some sort of a super hero. This is just plain garbage. Skip it, I wish I did.",F9 - The Fast Saga
456,theseventhstooge,Tired,5,4 July 2021,"Like others, I didn't like this movie as much as the others. The storyline with Cena was a missed opportunity and ended haphazardly; he was a weak bad guy.

Just characters and the same overall plot that's been used in the previous films.... nothing new. In fact, they don't even really bother with any development assuming anyone watching this already knows all the characters and they don't need to explain or develop ANYTHING.Miraculous twists do abound though... to bring back dead characters and introduce new, never before discussed, family members. It's really bordering on ""soap opera"" writing. F10 will most likely be one of the characters waking up from a dream imagining all 9 films happened.This is bad.

465,stevenrodz,The worst 2021 movie ever! please NO MORE!,1,28 August 2021,"For all the hype generated, F9 is not just disappointing but frustrating. Let me put this in short:The cast looks terrible except for Nathalie Emmanuel & John Cena. Cardi B? Yuck!Not a single action or fight scene is believable or interesting. Moronic sequences to waste people's time and money!Once again Vin Diesel fcuks everything up by trying to make himself look good at the expense of others as he's been doing after Furious 7 and as Sly Stallone did with The Expendables.The movie makes Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris look like clowns. And even though they're to provide the comedy element they end up looking pathetic. Literally monkeys in space.The villains display all the shine they absorbed from the goldmember of Austin Powers.Kids have no place in this movie. Yet someone with their extreme hormonal fluctuations decided that they'd bring kids for sentimental or emotional value. Pity.There is nothing for men in this movie - no hot girls, cars, action,story-line. Nothing!Martyn Ford is literally and absolutely wasted especially when you have John Cena in the same movie. Talk of wasting a chance to create an epic battle of 2 well-known musclemen if even for a minute à la Fast and Furious 6. Instead their confrontation was made an afterthought and pee wee Vin decides to fight everyone & somehow is the only guy in the entire movie who can beat everybody. Seriously FO!No Dwayne Johnson and no cops?(Georgian police driving flimsy cab cars doesn't count) Seems a little too woke to keep your biggest asset out of film.

YES! , but why show that in the previews? That could have been a great surprise to find in the movie and makes his hero shot that much better. On that note, I still want them to bring back Gisele, find a way to make it happen Vin and Justin.I think this movie would have been bettered serviced by having Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) in it, at least then Cousin Oliver doesn't seem so shoe-horned in to the franchise (no offense Kurt Russell). So in F10, figure it out, get over your egos, get Hobbs back in with the family.I guess my biggest issue is the the lack of stakes in the movie. Which was one of the hallmarks of the franchise. They've always been a bit ham-fisted in laying the stakes out, but this was a different level, like trying teach a monkey to type. The stunts were just there, they weren't really servicing the story like they had in the past (yes even the sub chase in F8 felt like greater stakes than anything in this movie). The stunt scenes look impressive from a 10,000 foot view, but with a lack of stakes, they are just there, especially the bungie jumping the car scene.All in all, I really wanted to love this film for all the insanity it brings to the screen, but that lack of stakes pulls this movie down from a solid 8 to a pathetic 3 stars in my book.",F9 - The Fast Saga

491,win_kk,Here are 10 reasons why it makes TOTAL SENSE.,9,29 August 2021,"OK, first I read at least 3 pages of reviews here and take note on what most of you have said about this movie. Then I watch it again, rewind, pause etc. If you watch the details, it does make sense and the director has thought about it almost everything. I don't understand what up with all the hates. I am genuine reviewer and not getting paid for this.First complain, land mine scene. You don't get hit if you drive fast enough cause the mine has a few seconds delay. Roman tank got hit a few times since his truck couldn't go fast enough and after a few hits, the wheels came off. So it does make sense.Second Roman didn't die by all these guns fire. Well the guy wore the bullet proof vest and he did get a few shots on his chest and his reaction was fast enough to shoot them before they shot at him. Luckily not his head but then again it is hard to get hit on the head if you are shooting aimlessly at moving target unlike a sniper. People just aim at the body where the biggest area to get shot at which is why you wear bullet proof vest to survive.Third, how the hell the plane can pick up the moving car in the air. So it is possible with strong magnet and fast jet. Not in the helicopter for sure. So again make sense to me.Fourth, how Dom could swing the car at the bridge scene. The bridge is crap and mostly made of rope or metal line. So the car hit the pole and got hook up underneath. Then swing due to high speed to the other side but won't hold strong enough to swing back because the bumper and a lot of the metal part were already damaged during car chase.Fifth, how Han came back. They explained it in details.Sixth, why Dom brother introduce now. Well if you watch F2, FBI explained and shown to Brain that he nearly kill the man with wrench. This movie link to first and second movie. Nice welcome to John Cena.Seventh, magnet. Watch the details. Red is attract. Blue push away. Every scene when they did it, they show which colour they use and how strong they put on. Totally makes sense and really cool and creative. How they pull the car and push away. Everything makes sense. They pull the cars, phone from a few meters or yard, not like miles away.Eight, they go to space. What wrong with that? You don't need NASA to train you. Elon and Virgin go to space. If you have smart people in the team and have money, it is possible. It makes sense that they can knock out the satellite but won't be able to get back unless some rescue them in the space. It's not like going to the moon or Mar. Just out to the space and back.Ninth, Brian look after kids. Some people are so sexist here. It's Dom and Mia brother. Their affairs. Why would Brian should get involved. I rather look after babies and it's not my business. Again make sense that Mia went instead of Brian. At the end, you saw Brian Skyline and saving a seat at the lunch.Tenth, lost all the street racing and girls. Every Fast and Furious movie maintain that scene. 2 scenes. Dom and Jacob race in the city. There were bunch of girls with music in the Jacob party.Seriously, I don't get all the complaints here. They are either uneducated or bunch of kids who don't understand anything. Yes it is a bit crazy with action but that the whole point of the movie. Showing something amazing and won't see it in other movies but it is all possible. I have seen every single movie that comes out every week. I do know when things don't make sense like Suicide Squad 2 for example. Walking star fish with one eye? Come on. Anyway hope that this review clear up all the complaints here. Still entertaining as ever and really fun to watch.",F9 - The Fast Saga

You just thrown away Tokyo Drift just to make some unnecessary, unfunny scenes with the characters. And why did you decide to forget about the physics and realism? A car in space?!

This latest one, was beyond ridiculous though, terrible storyline, even worse plot holes, completely abandoned any semblance of ""well it might just be possible"".

501,james-218-791197,The Bad and the Outrageous,1,23 October 2021,"*** Spoilers ***I have a difficult relationship with this franchise.The first film, a typical Rob Cohen flick, wasn't exactly genre busting, but it did set a precedent for what a car movie could be. Sure, some dodgy script writing, some cringey acting, and some dubious technical aspects (the metal plate flying off the bottom of Bryan's car mid-race?!), but for Point Break with cars it was highly enjoyable.2 Fast was a cop movie in the vein of the Bad Boys franchise, and Tokyo Drift essentially rebooted the series whilst cashing in on the popular Japanese drift scene.But all 3 were enjoyable in their own ways.Beyond that, it starts to get a little tedious. 4, 5 and 6 are watchable but feel a little like we're cashing in on the franchise. The stunts and action become less and less believable, the stories less and less plausible, the acting less and less credible.7 and 8 are horrific. Mr Nobody, God's Eye, remote controlling hundreds of cars, rattling on constantly about family, hacking a nuclear submarine...And as for Hobbs and Shaw? Let's not even go there. Dross.So where does 9 go, in order to validate its existence beyond the already extraordinary and unbelievable plot lines, characters, and sequences? Anything less than full on implausible nonsense and it can't trump the previous movies. In this regard - it doesn't disappoint.It actually starts off promising - recalling the story of his father's crash that we heard about in the first film. And then... we revert to type.Let's ignore the fact there's a weapon that will reset the world that is split in 2 halves and activated by a girl. Let's ignore the fact Han is actually still alive. Let's ignore the car jumping off a cliff and being caught by a stealth jet. Let's ignore Dom somehow driving a car off a cliff, hooking it on a rope, and landing on the other side. We have to ignore all that utter tripe because...?THEY FLY A CAR INTO SPACE TO DISABLE A SATELLITE.Fans of the franchise might lap it up. But ultimately, it is impossible to take this movie seriously. It's drivel. I hated it SO much, even seeing an orange Supra as a nod to the original didn't impress me.And they're making a 10th. Please don't. Let's just pretend Cypher gets a job working for Facebook and the rest of them go live in Mexico and be done with it.",F9 - The Fast Saga

508,carsontuscany,The Continuation of a Downward Tread,6,25 June 2021,"56/100F9 is somehow the most outrageous film in the F&F franchise, while at the same time being the weakest and least interesting of the batch. The film is just not what viewers come for, and unlike every other film in the franchise, it's not even a great ""turn your brain off"" action film, as there aren't many action scenes at all. Along with the lackluster plot and action scenes, as big of a budget as F9 has backing it, the special effects are at times brutal, looking comical and not for a single second realistic. The one saving grace of F9 that prevents it from being a complete waste of time through and through is that the final act pulls out all the punches and delivers outrageous action familiar to all of the other films. Over the last two or three installments of F&F, the films have continued to tread downward and get worse and worse, partially because with each new film released, they try to one-up the last and do something viewers have never seen before, and with now 9 films in, there's not much left to do. Given how much money these films make, I don't see the franchise ending anytime soon, and at this rate it might just dig itself into the grave over time.",F9 - The Fast Saga

It's like the writers and director think they can just acknowledge it's insane with a joke but then move on.We literally saw the guy we surrounded by dozens of men and shot point blank with bullets hitting him over and over. And he just shrugs it off and claims he invincible because his jacket has bullet holes in it but he did t get hurt.I thought they were going to say his clothes are a new type of bullet proof armour. That's at least logical for this franchise. But they just say nothing. We even saw a truck fall on him, and he walked around from the back as if it didn't land on him. Makes zero sense. This same guy also flies a car into space and survives in outer space wearing a scuba suit, like seriously wtf.Another scene they drive through a mine field, bad guy cars blow up as soon as they hit a mine, while good guys vehicles drive over them and they blow up after. Even when the cars are side by side doing the same speed.And the hacker who can't drive, struggles to turn on the truck, but then Instantly puts the truck into gear and drives off. A car would have been hard for her to drive, but a truck is way harder. How does she know gears etc.Dom can literally pull metal chains from solid concrete and collapse a building with his strength. Also he can hold back 12 guys with his arms stretch out wide.It's like he gets to write into the movies that he gets scenes that show he's stronger than everybody, taller than everybody and can do inhuman things.I do miss when the movies were about fast cars, realistic heists and some action.Now it's just superhero level bs with some charlies angles level bad movie scripts.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Overstuffed with characters from past movies. This and the callbacks to previous events would leave casual or incidental fans mystified.And then came the moment they took a car into space. Just ugh. That's when I realized this series had reached its Moonraker moment... that the series had become a parody of itself.Somewhere in there lip service paid to a family drama which consists mostly of two meatheads -- Diesel and Cena -- grimacing at each other.

I have always admired their use of practice effects but this one felt like a blue screen bonanza. The narrative really did feel like a photocopy of the movies that came before it, although I know this expected to an extent.I don't like to be negative about any movie as I appreciate how many people work really hard to get it on that screen.Also if I am being really honest it was evident what Dwayne Johnson actually brought to those movies.I hope they end with F10 ... don't make the mistake shows like The Walking Dead made.Watch it if you're a fan of the franchise but I would sadly expect to be underwhelmed.",F9 - The Fast Saga

The acting was also really bad in some scenes, especially in the flashback scenes that just feel drug out in a movie that's too long to begin with. The characters could have been digitally de-aged considering they were still adults in the flashbacks and they take place about 10 years before the first film. Everyone should win an Oscar compared to Cardi B's cameo though (It wasn't cool, it was cringy).

First he died in Tokyo drift in a car accident..then it turned out the accident was actually murder because the guy who killed him was out for revenge, but how did the guy know where Han's car would be in the first place?

547,mackcrocker,My thoughts on fast 9,8,11 August 2021,Fast 9 was a really fun and action packed movie. I had so much fun watching this in imax and that's how I recommend seeing it. It was way better than the last movie. It had some non believable things like cars swinging from ropes and people surviving car crashes without a scratch on them but this is a movie you go into and turn your sense of reality off and just have fun. John cena was really great and I think he's going too be a great action star. It has some really awesome cars and some really cool fight scenes . It had a pretty emotional ending kind of like the seventh movie. I can't wait to see what's next and SPOILERS! They actually go into space which I thought was a bit much but it was fun and a very enjoyable movie. I give fast 9 a 8/10.,F9 - The Fast Saga
548,firebrand81,"Barely watchable, but just because action sequences are so ridicolous that look fun",6,31 July 2021,"Oh well, where to start:
the plot makes no sense at all. But that was the same for all the rest of the franchise, so it's not even a major complaint.main characters after so many movies from street racers became the Avengers. Still don't get why or how is even possiblethe laws of physics are being made a constant joke. Always have been in this franchise, but this gets even worse in this movie (not an easy feat!)being a main character makes you invulnerable, so you never ever get even a bruise or a scratch. 30 people can shoot you from all around, or you can have an horrible car crash with no air bags and car turning upside down, but you're always as fresh and clean as after a good shower. This becomes so ridicolous that during the movie this becomes a running joke.when there's no action scenes, you'll get so bored that you'll fall asleep. Luckily, non-action parts last 10 minutes at most.So:
non-action parts of the movie: 0/10action parts of the movie: 8/10Since I made it to the end of the movie, and I didn't run away before the ending, I'm giving 6/10, which means ""barely watchable, but just because action sequences are so ridicolous that look fun"".",F9 - The Fast Saga

550,steven_kearns,Is it supposed to be a full blown sci-fi comedy?,1,15 July 2021,"From start to finish this is the stupidest film I have ever seen. I haven't enjoyed any of the movies since Paul Walkers untimely death but at least they still had a sense of the original feel to them. Dom is a superhero and can defy the laws of physics much like the rest of the cast; I know he has a contract stating he can't lose a fight on screen but in one particular scene he turns into the Incredible Hulk manages to smash 8 or 9 armed men whilst lifting and throwing them to then only confront a group of around 14 guys and manages to push them back, fight his way back up off the ground and use metal chains to tear down a building. If his ego is as bad as this movie clearly displays then I can see why he and the Rock did not get along.Jacob, who is the main protagonist throughout, redeems himself not by acting in a selfless manner or turning over a new leaf but simply gets double crossed by the crew he leads and that seems to be enough to forgive every single thing he has done during the movie including trying his utmost to kill millions of people.We laughed out loud during every action scene and the forced ott emotion between the main characters was so poorly acted it was like a straight to TV movie.If zero stars was possible it would still be too much.",F9 - The Fast Saga

557,mhert-69079,Devastated - big fan and of franchise,4,5 July 2021,"As someone who has come to really respect the game of FF franchise, this was a hugely disappointed experience.SPOILERS BELOWThe beauty of the franchise is that they take a simple premise like, ""Letty is working for the bad guys,"" and then get into all kinds of craziness. They make cool detailed methodical plans with absolutely insane things that come out of nowhere. Like the wrecking ball in F8 or the parachuting from a plane in F7. It is crazy and fun the whole time. They seem to be invincible but their constantly concerned about the real dangers involved.This movie took away all the cool plans, butchered a simple premise, and removed all the tension from action scenes.Rome literally dodging a thousand bullets and then talking about how it is crazy that they are still alive is so upsetting. They ""hung a lantern"" on the plot armor of their characters which undercut every cool thing they did. It totally ruined the movie.Not to mention there was just something missing the whole time. I did not have any good reason to believe the team would be interested in this mission. They hung their necks out for Mr. Nobody before they knew Don's brother was involved. They are not supposed to be the super friends. They are supposed to be street racing reluctant thieves.Not a single street race, apart from a flashback. Most of their plans didn't even depend on fast cars the cars were like an afterthought. No one got excited about their cars or equipment.The ensamble cast was lost because they didn't have a plan that required a team. Their plan did require a group but not a team. They didn't showcase any of their individual skills in order to complete a goal. They just needed warm bodies. Not the best racing/thieving team in the world.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Seriously, the series has raised the bar consistently each outing in a very organic way to get the the insanely fun madness that is F9.The characters, the callbacks the deepcuts (to a crooked nose on a returning character!) this one delivers. THIS IS THE WAY to return to the movies (no offense TENET)! Everybody is on point looking to be giving their all. We finally get justice first Han and flashbacks long overdue that nicely recon new and old threads (like introducing John Cena and making a compelling character arc too). Returns include Queenie & Cypher with an even more disturbing haircut but terrific scenery chewing performance. At about 2 1/2 hours it flew by, FAST & FURIOUSLY even to the final minutes which is a shot to the heart.Going in cold is fun, but if you're up to speed on the SAGA this has so big payoffs.

Of course each new film has to outdo the previous but this one has gone too far in my humble opinion. The inclusion of the impossible electromagnetic devices , that the ridiculous plot relies heavily upon, puts this film squarely into the ""Sci-fi"" / Action movie category which is a shame.

Like the american markets are opening while canadas and most other countries, can't even go to the cinemascurrently.I personally think fast five was the best, even though it didn't sell nearly as much as furious 7 did.I just think we need to see mia get violent a little more often, maybe with a fight scene of her own.I also still think stone cold or Goldberg would be lit in this series.Im reading all these reviews and honestly its nothing to me, people have an ideology of myth and real, are we creating a movie that grabs the audience, that's all that matters,I read reviews all the time and ill be honest with some, the people are sick, they want everything to be a true story or marvelmarvel is trash and I'd never consider working thereMarvel destroys there own story the comic creators made and ended in 1968Funny how children and the new generation only needs is to see or want fantasy and leo tards.Every fast movie has a turn point where somebody is in trouble and its up to the team to find out the whys and whens, the story is fiction because if anybody did these stunts they'd be in jail for life.The story is about a cop who fell in love with a woman and dom, mias brother, has a wreck less past.There, bond doesn't only shape who they are but the integrity of there livelihood, this story is about the ultimate heroDominic Toretto and Brain O'Connor surviving the ups and downs of there everyday life who they were as friends and what they're paths lead them too.Like stop bringing people back from the dead,gal gabbot should have brain injury and captured by terrorist.She didn't get shot in the head.Lastly I dont consider someone dead unless a bullet to the headand han should have scars on his face from the burns from Tokyo drift.Fast is an evolving franchise based on technology cars and stunts.Plus Dominic Purcell would of made a good brother to Dominic Toretto in the series.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Like most multi sequels of big budget films, the ramping up of stunts and action sequences was a given and only matched by genuine chemistry of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez etc. Fast 9 takes the crown that I don't think any other film this year will be able to knock off it's head for being the worst big budget film of 2021 so far.

We've got Dom's evil super spy brother, a backstory told through momentum killing flashbacks, Han is back from the dead(after faking his death with a hologram), the 3 guys from Tokyo Drift building spaceships and giant magnets. Dom and team survive seemingly impossible scenarios over and over and Roman even brings it up during the movie after a truck lands on him. Was that a 4th wall break? At one point one of the bad guys mentions X-Wing starfighters and the Milenneum Falcon. At the rate we're going F10 will be set on the Death Star with Dom facing off against Darth Vader.

So unless F9 is trying to be a parody of something this is just pathetic.If you can stomach the first 20 mins it might get better after that but for me it felt like same old same old with way worse writing.Please dont make any more of these or just turn it into a TV series1/10.,F9 - The Fast Saga

To the stunts, sorta try and make your mind think of any reasonable explanation on how it all could work and themselves not one mark on them,it's like gravity and realism doesn't exist. At least James bond and Mission Impossible films the stunts in theory could work in real life but in this film it's like some 10 year olds were tasked into thinking up new ways of entertainment.But why the 5? The magnets. First seen and copied from 6 Underground these make an appearence...and it's very entertaining.Won't mention the space bit.Switch off your brain and just admire the stunts.. don't question them, or relate to realism...

Im glad to see Han back but the way they did it was so unbelievable and so bad im not going to put spoilers but it was bad.

I'm very serious about my taste on the movies which are trying to be art, but when I know a movie is for entertainment at the beginning, I don't expect so much. Just show me some newest SFX, good music, a not bad story, and I believe a pass I'll give.Unfortunately, I got nothing from this movie. No impressive effects, awful story, and since I'm not a fan of hip-pop, make it even worse. I don't like the attitude producers toward fan. They have the budget($200m I saw), but just repeat the 'family' word.Anyway, It's amazing to see a series been there 20 years, and will still continue.",F9 - The Fast Saga

I get why because there doing it for Paul because Paul said he wanted to do 10 Fast and Furious movies, but man no disrespect to Paul or any of the cast and crew who made this franchise awesome, but to me this series has just gotten stupid.

The story was much better than the previous movies, a good plot but the action scenes ruined it.John Cena did a really good job but he was invisible throughout the movie.

Felt like a tribute to the familia more than as a movie. I get they are ending the series and I will be honest I did enjoy this one but the excitement was kind of left out in this one. The adrenaline rush that you get watching these movies was a bit missing here. I think I really missed tej and Roman in the climax as they were in space and they should've been with the team on the ground fighting which would've been more fun. John cena did real good in the movie though and was actually watchable and applauded. The rest of the crew was alright and this time tej and Roman took the charm from the whole crew. They literally wasted Han. He could've done so much more to the movie and Mia was also wasted here. F8 in my opinion was a lot better and was more fun going and traditional to the franchise. Cipher escapes once again which has gotten me excited as I loved her in f8 and I know she has a lot more to go for in this saga and I can't wait for what comes next but please, don't rush the next one and please be cautious of not getting to the space stuff again as it was a big blunder and did not make the movie feel big. Overall the movie was fun to watch but it will not be one of my favorite fast and furious movie. I rank this A 6 out of all the fast movies I have watched.",F9 - The Fast Saga

637,neelmani-66278,It's wonderfully amazing!!,7,1 August 2021,"The movie is very emotional and will take you to a feeling called nostalgia for the cast. I really felt the absence of Dwayne Johnson. He was neither in the 9th movie nor be going to be in both of the 10th part of the franchise. Movie consists of great action packed scenes but the return of Han was not potrayed with emotions and hence it lost its great power of making audience fall in love with him. The full star cast was the best.Now to the main point, I have read many reviews and people are saying that movie has illogical action scenes. I think they are those who haven't watched all of the movies because in neither movies there was logic in action, it was just the feeling to connect with the audience. I can say that it was too much in this film as compared to the others but I think we felt this because of the missing of most important person, Brian O'Conner, i.e. Paul Walker. He was the one who used to bring life to the character and was the major missing of the movie.",F9 - The Fast Saga

What the hell were you people thinking to have a black guy play a white guy, was there no other white guy interested in being apart of this stupid movie?The younger versions of Letti, Mia, Vince, and Jesse were a joke.I seriously can't understand how this movie made it passed production, what a sad sack of crap dumping such garbage over the Fast & Furious franchise.Do not watch this film ever!

Can be enjoyable if you're looking for some mindless action.Bringing Han back wasted the emotional weight and character motivations that were built in the previous movies, overplayed the use of magnets, the genre went from racing movies to mission impossible movies, The story was OK but didn't really hit the mark.

643,killianjoos,First one I saw,7,17 July 2021,To be completely honest with you this is the first fast and the furious movie I've ever seen and I thought it was pretty OK. I could tell there was a lot of inside jokes and references I didn't know but you can still understand the movie and the characters I thought the plot was pretty dumb (obviously I'm not gonna explain it because of spoilers) but you could tell they were trying to go for kind of a dumb fun plot and the action was flashy and Micheal Bay esc and that was a good fit. But remember you can't get 10 and 11 without 9. Overall I will definitely be watching it again and will watch the older fast and the furious movies.,F9 - The Fast Saga

Me, 45 years old, always liked the later series because of the nice cars, driven and acquired by the crew. This time, the most dangerous and valuable car was some Nissan, I guess. Also, many characters were just recycled in some stupid ""revival"" plot.I think, a series like this should retire and vanish in pride, don't make the Bruce Willis on it and make one stupid movie after another just to fill up the cash box.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Cars driving in the air under planes. Helicopters with missiles. They literally had a car flying into outer space and wearing astronaut suits. Absolutely horrendus fake studio towns. Car crashing and rolled 12 times and surviving without a scratch. Lifeless jokes while just destroying hundreds of cars. They have more access to technology than NASA and CIA themselves. The movie did not have a story to it whatsoever. Dom apparently has super strength as he fights off 13 trained men and tears down building blocks with his own arms.

666,Runrig,Even within the FF universe ... we jumped the shark,4,31 July 2021,"Going into this you know what you are about experience - over the top acting, forced family ethics and unity, gun fire that never seems to hit anyone in the main crew and cars that even the game RocketLeague would struggle to model.So there is a certain latitude you afford the team.However, this latest installment, was literally out of this world, and that is where we lost it. Though, if we are honest, we probably lost it the moment the car was swinging through cliffs like Tarzan.This was a good series, many moons ago.Even Cardi-B forced lines was cardboard and wooden - an actress she is not.It was fun to see them in Edinburgh (geography all over the place - some of those streets are not as long as they are portrayed!).",F9 - The Fast Saga

James Bond meets streetracing meets marvel meets whatever else is the flavor of the day?As bad as the Star Wars sequels or even Captain Marvel were, at least they had some sense of identity, whereas this is just empty calories that reek of studio desperation. Everyone involved should be ashamed.",F9 - The Fast Saga
668,francisdufort-75626,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!,3,27 June 2021,"That's the sound that I want to make after watching this movie.It's so bad, that it's hard to explain how bad it is. It's not even one of those ""It's so bad, it's good"" type of movies, just awful.First, the story is stupid: they are after a device that can control every electronic device on earth. They also need to get this device before Dom's yet unknown brother that finally decides to make an appearance in the ninth film of the franchise (10th if you count Hobbs and Shaw) to become the main enemy of the team, because... reasons. Apparently, this brother that comes out of thin air in the FaF lore is responsible for the death of Dom's father, which is why Dom hates him. I DON'T CARE. This movie is too long and it's because of stuff like this. So the team embarks on this journey across the world to find the two parts of this device and get clues, or something. But, they don't get the device, but instead find magic magnets that only work when the script needs it to. Because they can't get their hands on the magic device, they need to send two of them in space to stop the device from being activated in a satellite, while the rest chase the truck that contains the device. What???But honestly, this is nothing compared to the action scenes and the other problems of the movie. For example, this movie is full of clichés, terrible product placements, bad acting, dramatic poses, bad effects, etc. There is also no logic to how the magnet weapon works. Apparently, it's the strongest magnet ever, which would normally mean it catches or repulses everything around it, which is already impossible because of... you guessed it, physics, but nah, it only works when the script needs it to do so. Sometimes, it catches every single little thing, like phones, tools, cars, carts, guns, etc., sometimes, just the cars or guns. If it's the most powerful magnet, shouldn't it attract everything in every store and every pocket that it comes close to? But it also works without being attracted itself to other things, or destroying the cars that it's mounted to. This doesn't make any sense.Besides this, the movie also has the habit of saving the main characters from danger at the last second. EVERY SINGLE TIME. The worst example of this is at the beginning when the crew is about to get killed by this gang of militants, but Roman comes in to save the day by coming out of nowhere to ram into the militants. Oh wow, the main characters survived an encounter with terrorists that have a severe case of the stormtrooper syndrome, I wasn't expecting that. But they do this thing many more times, this wasn't the last. They survive every single thing at them, without a problem, it's really annoying.After this garbage formula to try and make action interesting and entertaining, they also add stuff that simply isn't possible. An example where Dom fights ten guys at once comes to mind. In that scene, the crew manages to stick all the guns and smoke grenades of the enemies on the wall with the magic magnet. The smoke starts to suffocate the bad guys, but not the good guys, because... physics don't count if you have a bald guy in his fifties fighting younger, more experienced soldiers in an action movie about cars, I think. They use this to their advantage to escape, while Dom tries to catch the guy with the device, but the soldiers catch up to him and fight him on this platform high above ground. He somehow manages to stand his ground in this clearly unfair fight, but he even manages to push every bad guy for second, to then use his muscles to pull down a concrete pillar, which destroys the platform and sends everyone in a pool below. The guy is literally strong enough to break off concrete from the ceiling.Hey, guess what, that guy that died a couple of movies ago, he's alive, because... reasons.Also, there is a scene where they are in japan, and while eating, the girls of the crew see a flag of Mexico. They think this is a reference to a sentence that was said before and decide to investigate the apartment. They are in Tokyo, there are probably thousands of flags of Mexico in Tokyo, but who cares about logic, let's enter without permission in this apartment, and of course, it's the apartment of the person they were looking for, but villains get in and they have this unrealistic fight, to get saved at the last section by the guy that everyone thought was dead. Seems legit.I also want to talk about the space stuff. It is so dumb, it makes no sense. Also, how did the guys in Germany manage to get access to a jet to carry the car-rocket close to space??Now, let's talk about the funky stunts. There is a part where Dom has to get across a bridge, but the bridge disappeared, so as he's getting chased by helicopters, he decides to run into a pole attached to a rope. The rope gets stuck to his car and he gets swung across the canyon. ???????? Bonus point, the helicopters even stop chasing him.There is also a scene right before this where the bridge gets destroyed and starts falling while a car is going across that bridge, and the car doesn't fall. ???There is also another scene where a Mustang jumps off a cliff and gets caught mid-air by a plane with magic magnets. What????Honestly, there is so much more awful stuff, but I can't name it all. It would just like to mention the scene where a car gets attracted through a wall because of the magic magnets. The magnets somehow don't attract anything IN the building, but they attract a car with enough force to make it go through a wall. How???With all of these horrible stunts, there is also a major lack of logic, boring characters, a switching of sides from the villain, bad physics, awful jokes, predictability, clichés, and the same ending as the other movies. There is even more than this, but it's too long to name it all.It's hard to explain how bad it is in a written review, but save your money and don't go see this movie.",F9 - The Fast Saga

On one hand this film is fun and takes a lot of risks. It's definitely entertaining and of course you love the characters because these are people who have been around since the beginning. But on the other hand it's absolutely unrealistic and nonsensical. Cars fly around without and people fly around without injuries. And characters do crazy things.

For me it's the baddest in the series and it's not because it's over the top, more-so because of the flat storyline and boring drama. Let me explain.Throughout the whole movie I felt like there was nothing at stake.Bringing back dead heroes takes away the emotional aspects of previous films and makes me feel like these movies don't have a thrill anymore.And the bad guy turning good scheme gets boring too. It's just more so of the same formula. It was innovative when they first did it and that's why we loved it. But repeating the same formula over and over is only a cash grab and big dissapointment.Please Lin, Diesel and Crew. If this gets a sequel, do it the right way.

F9 is a accidental masterwork in a long line of films from a franchise that anyone should enjoy watching cars go fast and action goes boom. Love and family, likeable characters and outrageous story plots, it's Indiana Jones in a fast car. What is wrong people, relax and enjoy yourselves sometimes, get out of your head.",F9 - The Fast Saga

I remember the days in past when we used to make memes about the direction of F&F series going forward, and guess what those memes have now become a reality with this one.Save yourself, don't watch it. And if you do so, then go and watch with a switched off brain, but i guess that's a difficult thing to do...If you're gonna continue the F&F series like this, please STOP!

They are really ruining what used to be about togetherness and a love of cars.I don't want to review adding a spoiler, but my gosh just don't watch it, don't buy it, don't even stream it, it was again a showing of impossible feats being achieved. It just shouldn't exist as a film, I've only ever been more underwhelmed by the Transformers Franchise. It has so many flaws, from believability, to plot, to setting lack of context, no ingenuity no real desire to be entertaining or promote cinematography of any kind.At this point if you asked a 5 year old to make a movie or what he/she would include in this film, the script, plot, scenes, clothes, cars and action would turn out 100% the exact same.

Pretty much all logic and physics is thrown out the window at this point.

Most films have unrealistic hints but this was over kill of CGI and the plot line was ... I'm not even sure what to sa. I hope this is the last film from the chain as this has been become more and more disappointing. Not only was it shockingly bad but let's say magnets have a big role in this film but the way they work makes no logical sense there's was 20 mins of driving the rest was terrible green screen.

Over the top, unrealistic and too much CGI.Seriously, who drives a sports car on jungle roads? And then the cable catch to swing the car over to the other side just did it for me.

E.g. Hobbs & Shaw was a good watch imho.This one is a shocker, and not as a result of the COVID virus restricting current movie making.It is very badly written, disjointed, zero commitment from the cast who just go through the motions, no exceptions unfortunately.By the way, in my view Vin is a good ""type"" actor with high personal work standards. However, his work as Dom in this entire franchise has been pretty average and he reaches a new low F9.Vin's forced smiles, overdone swagger and portrayal as the great Dom, the ""duke"" of speed, wisdom and gangs simply fail miserably. Sadly he is VERY disappointing, even rubbish, on this occasion.SUMMARY:
a poorly done Cash Cowdefinitely not worth paying even one buck to seesave your time to watch it on late night TV, rest assured that it won't be long before it's on free-to-air TV.FOR UNDER 13s ONLY, and just maybe for a few slightly older hard-core fans who just can't do without their F&F fix.",F9 - The Fast Saga

These films have reached a point now where there doesn't need to be any real actors. They just as well cgi everything. There was a chance for a genuinely interesting world of modified cars to be created in this franchise. And now we just get cars with rockets on, smashing into satelites whilst the two people in said car are patching thier 'spacesuit' together with duck tape.

It's just sad that crazy stunts and action scenes weren't as entertaining as in the previous installments. The tone just doesn't fit this level of craziness and it can't be treated seriously.

After 10 minutes in I thought this movie couldn't get any more ridiculous so let's keep going. Well...there is a bit of everything magnets, space and plenty of ""hey didn't that guy die"" moments. I think they forgot that Charlize was in the movie. It's a mess with too may back stories and plenty of insurance claims per scene.

At first I thought I must have missed some vitally important joke or piece of plot that explained why this was so terrible. He told me that,no, there was no explanation for this. It did make me laugh out loud quite a few times at the sheer stupidity, so I guess I could find one positive. Overall, it made me feel like I was dumber for having watched it.

791,sulepvp,Horrible acting horrible story and unrealistic,1,27 May 2021,This movie was horrible. I want to leave in the first 20 minutes but I stayed to finish my popcorn and drink and just decided to force my way through.The movie had terrible acting. The story line is just unbelievable absurd. And it's so unrealistic it's crazy. Fast and furious was a car movie with some visual effects. Not having one guy carry a car with his hand or kill 30 people at once or doge 500 bullets or jump to another island in the air. That may be accepted but the horrible storyline as well? I don't understand why this story was accepted. It was so bad.,F9 - The Fast Saga

797,TheActionBuff,I'll keep coming back for more but..(6.4),6,25 June 2021,"A lot of front loaded action in this movie. I really enjoyed how the beginning 30-60 minutes of the movie played out. The middle had some fluff and got a bit cheesy with the ""family"" aspect. Writing was pretty decent filling in gaps for questions I was having. I think they should keep cypher as the main villain and quit twisting in more family scenarios. By adding to prior storylines, it also dilutes some of the prior films value to me. Plus, although I love the cast, I am here for the cars. More cars please!",F9 - The Fast Saga
798,godsofdaut,MOST impressive part was they somehow made a fiero more deadly,3,11 July 2021,"This is definitely a film, It gets 2 stars because it was nice to finally be back in a theatre if I didn't pay money for it I probably would've left the theatre . The back story was awful , just so stupid and so over explained like 20% of the film is a flashback just to try to make you feel something for Cena and Diesel's relationship. The fight choreography is absolutely non-existent , the scene where they go looking for Han is especially bad. THE CG IS AWFUL , there is a shot where every single tree is the same , facing the same direction even just a single reused asset with 0 effort to hide it. Also this film tries very hard to be every other popular genre. Also what is up with all the references to other stuff ""hey here's a pop culture reference "" is never interesting. It gets the last star because for some reason Diesel keeps poking peoples chest like E. T and saying ill be here and that was kind of funny because I feel it was not intentional. Anyway , for a film of this magnitude there was very little that was enjoyable and the ridiculous space stuff might have been the most fun segment of this entire film. 3/10 watch ONLY if you live in a country with legalized weed.",F9 - The Fast Saga

And with that came a huge fanbase and that's all that matters to them right now.Like the Marvel films, people love to see crazy stunts combined with CGi and a straightforward plot. Nothing fancy, just guys saving the world.F9 definitely has what the fans are looking for but a change in director can maybe just give it a bit more style. Lin did a good job with 5, which is arguably the best one, but just stuck to the same formula ever since.Simply put, there is no WOW factor in this one and since it's fan base is so big and raking in the money, it's probably going to stick to the same formula for the last 2 films.",F9 - The Fast Saga

813,bspoorendonk,"Everything bad, yet amusing",4,4 July 2021,"So in my opinion, almost everything is bad about this movie. The story itself is absolutely ridiculous and predictable. The story about Han surviving is so bad, it wouldn't even work in a comedy. The whole catholic stuff with the kid is nonsense. The jets catching cars and the car hooked on a robe swinging to the other side.. why why why? But when you thought.. it can not get worse.. The flying through space with a car with a jet on top.. I am not even going to comment on that. The jokes don't work. The actors turned their characters in caricatures..Just make it about racing again. Please! Use normal race cars. A bit of action is okay.. a bit over the top is fine.. but don't ask a 10-year old to write the story please?So.. after all these bad things..

815,johnyoungphotos,It was good eye candy but that is it,2,14 August 2021,I think the key with the fast and the furious movies now (not the earlier ones) is to not take them serious at all. Turn your brain off and totally ignore physics and common sense and just enjoy them for what they are. Fast and furious now are super hero's but I did like how one of the characters even mentioned that as if acknowledging the silliness of it all.The first fast and furious movies were brilliant and all about car racing etc. That time has passed and now they are just silly action movies so enjoy them for that.,F9 - The Fast Saga

And as ridiculous as those were, I gave the franchise the benefit of the doubt because they always made it somewhat plausible and you knew you were watching a big, dumb, action pop corn movie and as long as the story was easy to follow you were in for a good time.The plot was and story were a mess. All over the place and made no sense. Just seemed like a bunch of jumbled up sequences stuck together.For almost a decade I joked with friends and family how eventually the Fast & Furious crew will be racing in outer space eventually, because that was the most farfetched and ridiculous joke I could think of... and then they actually went and did it!And to think all this started from stolen DVD players.",F9 - The Fast Saga

844,jer283,"The worst of the series, by a long shot.",1,6 September 2021,"I truly miss the earlier entries in the franchise. I didn't like Paul Walker that much as an actor before I saw the first movie, but slowly began to really enjoy the ""family"" dynamic once the characters came together and worked as one. Well, all except for Roman, who is only good for saying lines like ""this is crazy - I'm out."" Seriously dude, how many times can you complain and whine but still be found useful?Anyway, F&F did start out as a ripoff of Point Break's plot, but it was still captivating in a way, especially for action fans and those of us who really enjoy the camaraderie within the group. Except Roman - please erase his character. The guy is awful. I also find it hilarious that the big-Afro Ludacris from FF2 is suddenly the tech genius.Starting with FF7, the plots and action started to get WAY over the top. Sure, the precious films before 7 were a bit much in their own ways, but still didn't reach the ""completely unbelievable"" phase until...well, toward the end of FF6, when Dom launches himself out of a car, over a many a hundred feet of straight down, and catches Letty midair. Even that I could forgive, but when they dropped cars out of a plane in FF7, that's when the disbelief really started to wear away my loyalty to the series.Still, I watch them with the hope that they will drop the ridiculous, too crazy to believe stunts, and get back to the good ol' days of street racing or robbing corrupt people of their money. No such luck. Now, the world depends on the FF crew (sense of family nonexistent) to rescue the world and it's secret agents from a bowl cut terrorist. Sigh.I was still in for the ride though, that was, until I saw a car hitch a ride across a chasm on a swinging rope left over by an ancient bridge. I gave it up right there for a while.I came back to finish it up, honestly out of boredom and that nagging itch about leaving movies unfinished. Plus, I have this wish that they'll somehow incorporate Paul Walker's character back into the films (I know it's impossible, ugh). Anyway, it became even more ridiculous from there, and really hit the pinnacle of stupid when two guys got into a rocket powered Fiero to go disable a satellite (hey tech dude, if you and Ramsey are so brilliant, why couldn't you hack it from the ground?), and end up basically flying the damn thing around in space, with Roman suddenly being an experienced astronaut at controlling thrusters in zero gravity. Okay, a Fiero in space? And that's how you incorporate Lucas Black's character back into the film? He goes from being a drift champion to experimenting with crappy old cars and rocket engines? WTH? And Han? What the hell is up with everyone dying but not dying? Why wouldn't Han say anything to his ""family"" before this film? I was waiting for Giselle to come walking out with him, since death apparently has no meaning.The only kernel of good I saw in this movie was at the very end, when the Skyline pulled up into the driveway. That reminded me of the GOOD FF movies, back when Dom & Brian were like brothers. RIP Paul Walker - you really made these films so much better, man.I even watched Hobbs & Shaw purely out of loyalty for the franchise, which was also a disappointment. I think I'm done with FF, even as much as I don't want to be. I don't think FF10 could be any more ridiculous than a Fiero space ship or launching cars with magnets. This one took the cake.

The acting has never been good, but this is honestly hilarious in how bad everyone is, Vin Diesel's acting is like being tortured endlessly and he seems to get worse with each passing entry.Remember when they drove cars in a competitive setting?

The stunts are over the top. The acting is so forced and cringy. To watch it just makes me sad. And while we're at it can someone please stop John Cena acting also? That would be great.

849,arizefit,Even the directors and writers are laughing at themselves,1,20 June 2021,This movie is full of moments shrouded in sarcasm as the actors are used to portray the complete lack of substance and raw ridiculous nature if this movie. Yet amongst all the bad reviews lives the reason why the franchise continues... we all payed to watch. So it will continue. Definitely in my top 10 worst movies ever made. Not because of how bad it was but because it reminds me of the modern intelligence and understanding of the real people that view this as entertainment.,F9 - The Fast Saga

This film is one of the dumbest, most ridiculous and most boring film I've ever seen in my entire life! Jacob Torreto (John Cena)'s character was pretty much useless (due to the ending).

Sure.....Is it worth spending 20-30 dollars for? Probably not.... I would wait until this is on the streaming of your app or cable provider.

859,rileyesmay,"Solid, but not there",6,22 September 2021,"As we all are aware the FF franchise has been on a decline, well since the first move to be honest. I really felt like this was the first move that changed that. I honestly felt it was better than F8. It had a decent mix of action, racing, comedy, etc. Obviously with my 6 star rating it wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad, it was definitly worth watching, just not the best one, the 8th best to be exact ahead of F8.",F9 - The Fast Saga

861,fpratt,"Halfway decent, as long as you can suspend disbelief.",6,23 September 2021,"Yes, there are some truly unrealistic sequences in this movie, but this isn't all that much of a surprise for a group of quasi superheroes who have taken on heavy military-grade equipment (jets, tanks, submarines, etc.) with barely a scratch. The physics and science associated with some of the stuff in this movie doesn't make sense, but it's still not as unbelievable as half of the stuff that Tony Stark invented. If you're okay with the fact that Fast and Furious franchise is no longer about street racing, then this movie should be worth the rental price.",F9 - The Fast Saga
862,richpm-1,Enjoyable if you only want continuous action,7,30 June 2021,"F9 reminds me of the Roger Moore James Bond movies that became pure absurdity - like Moonraker but far far moresoThe script makes no sense, kind of like a story from an infinite pool of monkeys on typewriters having a chance at writing a great novel. But this was not a great novelJust enjoy the action and don't look for a story.",F9 - The Fast Saga
863,edmoy,"Big, Dumb, Loud, Cash Grab for Universal",5,30 June 2021,"This movie was definitely a CASH grab for Universal Studios. The Fast & Furious franchise should've ended after Paul Walker died but now they're just milking it for more moneyF9 felt like a big, dumb, loud soap opera. The story twists are just worn out tropes taken from old daytime soap opera scripts. Brothers separated by a family tragedy turn up on opposing sides of the law. A dead character shows up alive years later.Probably the most ridiculous part of the movie is when they strapped those rockets to a Pontiac Fiero, sending it into space where they smash into a satellite. Of course, the two characters miraculously survive and get rescued by the international space station!That whole rocket car space scene is even dumber than Fate of the Furious when Dom's car careens off the Russian Nuclear Submarine before the sub exploded and Dom somehow survived the blast..At least the actors are collecting their big paydays and residual checks so that's good for them but the audiences are the ones paying for this nonsense.Mostly Corny and Cheesy performances all around. At least the stunt ladies in the movie got plenty more action scenes and screen time.Han shows up alive again but explaining how he survived the car exploding in Tokyo Drift is too convoluted. Something about Gisele, Tokyo and Mr. Nobody hiring Han to steal a device and he ends up saving a little girl who is the daughter of the dead scientists that made the device. Then Mr. Nobody faked Han's death so he can disappear and apparently spend several years secretly training the little girl to become a badass fighter / ninja assassin?So basically, they retconned Han's death in Tokyo Drift, brought back 3 other characters from that movie to add more cartoony comic relief, while adding a new younger kick-ass Asian Female with ninja assassin fighting skills.It all sets up a potential spinoff movie for Han and the Asian girl along with the 3 comic relief car guys. But are audiences really gonna want to see that?Spoiler! Jason Statham also shows up in an end credits scene. Guessing he'll be back in F10 and/or F11?They even hinted at Brian returning at the end when his car is shown pulling up to the house that's being rebuilt after it got blown up in a previous movie.",F9 - The Fast Saga

There isn't even a word for it so I am gonna go with ridonkustupid! It's so beyond anything sensible it's hilarious.BUT and there a but! Firstly this is what we have come to expect. Haters gonna hate and people that love it will still watch. Secondly the film is constantly self aware of its stupidness as the cast jibes at it's ridiculousness constantly, which is funny.Thirdly though, and I have said this before, I don't watch these films for the action or even the cars anymore. As cheesy as it is it's about the ""family"" and ""sentimental"" stuff that I really enjoy and no.9 is stacked with this like usual.It's probably amongst the worst in the series but I still had an absolute ball watching and laughing at it.

As the movie progresses so does the entire concept of the film with unrealistic action set pieces which border on action parody.What was disappointing was the reveal of Han's survival.

Forget what you think Fast & Furious should be, it's not about street racing (being honest, it never was). If you don't like the way the franchise has gone, then don't watch it. It's not what you want, so don't watch it expecting it to be that and then complain when it's not.They have got to the point where they're embracing the memes, and poking fun at themselves. There's the scene when Roman is talking to Tej and Ramsey about how he thinks they're invincible. He is speaking for the audience here, acknowledging that the movie knows how unrealistic and crazy it is. We all know there's no way they could go through what they have in the franchise and come out relatively unscathed, and they've acknowledged that in the film and just said ""so what?"" And turned it into a comedic moment.And yes, they actually went to space. Everyone joked about it, so they turned round and just did it, you gotta love it.If you want a great plot, well developed characters, loads of detail about cars, racing and everything the first film in this franchise is perceived to be, then stay well away from this movie.If you just want to turn your brain off for two and a half hours and sit back and enjoy a wild action movie, full of crazy stunts and explosions then this movie is perfect for that.You've got to embrace the stupidity and don't take this movie too seriously because it's not meant to be.",F9 - The Fast Saga

It was so bad that I could not finish watching the movie. I liked all the previous movies of their franchise, but this one, I don't know what happened.A few of the scenes with no common sense..
Person chased by 14 people who have machine guns, tank and machine gun jeep, nothing happens to him and he kills all of them by himself. When the girl drives the van she would have crashed into at least 20 cars and that itself should have caused multiple fatalities. The super magnet thing has to be the dumbest thing. Initially the van runs with the magnet on and then small objects get attached to the van. All cars nearby are not affected. And then in another scene, they turn on the magnet and then the car they are chasing in the other street literally crashes into the van. Sometimes the Magnet makes even large trucks move towards their car in other scenes the car moves towards a truck, totally absurd. In another scene, a truck gets rolled over and over again and Vin diesel manages to run through it and start driving it. It gets hit by 4 missiles and nothing happens to Vin though he was in the drivers seat. In the end of that scene, he does not even have one scratch, his clothes looks as if they were ironed just then. And don't even get me talking about the space car thing.They should just fire the person who wrote this junk and send them to elementary school just to get the basics right.",F9 - The Fast Saga

'What?' 'Huh' ""So stupid', before you even have a chance of recovering from the laughable unrealistic moment you're than hit with another. It's nonstop dumb.For example...Gibson is running down a path and every bullet misses him the entire distance even tho he's maybe 50 yards directly ahead in the open?Not even 2 minutes later he goes crazy with a AK-47 and drops every single bad guy surrounding him like he's some sort of super assassin.Shortly after once again with 1,000 pound plot armor he dodges a land mine and a vehicle dropping on him.Meanwhile Michelle gets thrown up in the air which in real life would happen in about 2 seconds going from airborne to hitting the ground but Vin Diesel somehow manages to cover 100 yards and catch her on his hood.Queue 5 minutes later and Old Vinny launches off a bridge where apprantly he had it all planned out that one of his tires would somehow catch onto the bridge chain and perfectly swing him to another mountain where there just so happened to be a path as well.John Cena also flys off a cliff where some Avengers style jet catches it...I mean.....It's horrible people.At this point i was like ????????

They are able to our run bullets coming from a machine gun. But turn around with their revolvers and kill a dozen of highly rain military agents?A man is shot at by at least 10 odd machine guns comes off unscathed is then hit by a land mine, trapped in his car , gets out of the car and then said car falls on top of him ? He lands centimeters away from an active land mine and through ALL that walks away unscathed!!!Through this whole movie the cops are where exactly? All out on a lunch break ?The worst property damage and let's be honest London was left in SHAMBLES. I promise you civilians lost their lives but there's no report on the news? No police, FBI, CIA , Scotland Yard, Interpol, MILITARY???Dom manages to make a whole level UNDERGROUND made of CEMENT fall just with the sheer force of his biceps ??

Is the satellite revolving earth is easily breakable . Then the thing were bored of the villian same villian from part 8 no changes and the next part undoubtedly the villian will be the cypher only .

There are a number of related action sequences redone from past movies like when Letty is knocked on a motorcycle and Dom drives to cushion her fall just like he did with Ramsey in F7, there is also the stunt where Mia catches Jacob just like Hobbs catches Shaw's sister in the spinoff Hobbs and Shaw. I like the unexpected twist and explanation of how Hans came back to life. The spaceship thing was unexpected though I think it was an overstretch I guess due to pressure (hahahaa!) from the viewers but generally, its a typical fast and furious movie that will again stick you glued to the screen till the end.

But somehow people are bored enough to watch anything.Anyway, it is not awful. There is some action and someone who will remain unnamed thought he is still wrecking Star Trek!The biggest problem is that the scenes and the plot seem random. A bunch of scenes (here and in space) and then they said 'OK ship it out.'Bottom line: there is no reason to watch this movie other than to satisfy an addiction to franchises or the F&F franchise or to help the studio's cash position and stock price. If those are good enough reasons then go for it. The film is not a 1/10 and in fact is more believable than a high school in Tokyo Japan where every student is American for some reason rapping and talking smack (OK fine we did see a Japanese girl walk past I think once).They do not have girls being lesbonymphomaniacs either, Charlize is either having a mid-life crisis or lost a bet with her repulsive hair do and ... well, I cannot find any reason other than the above to watch this.",F9 - The Fast Saga

956,ramzyb,Visual spectacle that lacks meaning or reason,2,2 August 2021,"I grew up watching Fast and Furious films, and part of what made the films special, early on, was how much the movie focused on the cars and their individual personalities, as well as the interesting idiosyncrasies of car culture (tuning, modifying, racing, etc)F9 has thrown this all out and the cars have essentially become toys that exist to get crushed or blown up.Nothing about this movie really resembles the original Fast and Furious films from a decade ago, and the franchise now seems to parody the Marvel Cinematic Universe more than anything else.Early on in the movie Roman is surrounded by a dozen enemies that all fire on him from point blank range, and despite his jacket being riddled with bullet holes, Roman walks away from the encounter unscathed. Later in the movie, confused and irritated by the absurdity of what just happened, Roman approaches Tej and Ramsey, throws his jacket at them, and points to the fact that he's still alive and unharmed. Both Tej and Ramsey roll their eyes and brush it off, and that's all the viewers are given to explain what just happened.Fast and Furious has always been over the top, and the plot has always played second fiddle to the action set pieces, however the story, action, and set piece moments have now reached a point where the original characters could be replaced with Marvel heroes and the movie would actually become more believable. There is a scene in the movie where Dom literally takes on 20 fully armoured guards in hand to hand combat and manages to come out on top, then, to top it all off, at the tail end of the fight, Dom grabs a chain hanging from the roof, and with the sheer power of FAMILY he literally tears the reinforced concrete roof down with his bare hands. As I said above, we are at a point where Dom could be replaced by the Hulk to make the action slightly more believable and coherent.The action is loud, bombastic, and certainly fun to watch, but little respect is given to the viewer in the way of creating believable motives or character interactions. As mentioned above, Roman was shot multiple times by a dozen enemy soldiers, his jacket is literally covered in bullet holes, he raises this with his supposed ""family"", but it's simply ignored and turned into a funny oddity that Roman references in the movie a couple more times.Further, characters coming back from the dead completely invalidates the brevity and danger associated with life-threatening situations, as main characters getting hurt or dying is simply no longer in the realm of possibility.There are no stakes in this movie, main characters are covered in a thick layer of plot armour, and i honestly lost count of the number of deus ex machina moments where things magically fell into place, or were stumbled onto by happenchance, in order to advance the plot forward.The lack of stakes and real danger results in the movie feeling extremely bland and lacking any sense of suspense, which leaves you feeling empty when the credits roll.F9 has finally put the debate to rest, the series has finally jumped the shark.2/10, the explosions were cool I guess.",F9 - The Fast Saga

You've got an amazing cast with amazing chemistry and about everyone plays their roles very well.That's about it for the good stuff..This movie for me is an example of ""if it makes money, ..."". How are you gonna make Dom's motivation for everything ""family"" but it took 9 movies to mention his brother. That's the plot we're going with I guess.There are a lot of inconsistencies. Lazy writing. We've got magnets tech in this film now (okay?) but it only works in ways that are convenient for the plot. Sometimes it pulls everything metal, sometimes just 1 car and ignoring everything else. It's too obvious.Roman basicly admits they're in a movie. He literally says ""how is this possible, all those insane missions, but never a scar, not even a scratch"". Bruh how the writers not thinking that it makes all the action scenes pointless because there are no consequences whatsoever. Everyone lives. They all got 2-3 lives in em.Speaking about having no actual consequences. Han is back. They create this insane story about how and why he survived, where he is, what's his motivation, where's he been and still manage to fail to explain how he actually survived that crash or how he's still alive. Was that a fake scene of him in the previous film? Because we actually see Han die. Crazy writing. Laughable. Han also says when they faked the whole thing that it's ""like a magic trick"". (Movie laughing at itself)They don't pay off the tease of the rich and powerfull father of Otto.They're in space now. Yep. Rom and Tej just fly a car with a rocket attached to it like some space shuttle and crash it into a satellite. (They survive somehow)Look, I'm not harsh. I should be but it's a 5/10 for me. Enjoyment means a lot. I enjoy those insane over the top action scenes and funny dialogues between these characters we've know for so long. Doesn't make for a good movie, but an entertaining one?

The script was horrendous and the acting was what you would expect. There were no stand outs but a few that were not believable and were just there to tie into past movies in the franchise. If you go into this movie knowing it is just another franchise film that is slapped together with the aim of relying on nostalgia to sell seats and don't focus too much on character motivation or physics you will enjoy it. If you are expecting a well written and thought provoking film you will sadly be disapointed.

As I usually do I read some of the comments before going to see the movie. Someone said how science fiction had taken over the movie, I spent the whole movie looking for it and I didn't find any. I can see the scenes they mean like Dom fighting off all those guys but there's something called ADRENALINE and that's enabled women to lift when their baby is in trouble. It's also a MOVIE it's supposed to be ridiculous and outrageous. Basically if you're a fan of the series ignore the reviews and go see the movie, it's incredibly fast pace and engaging. My only recommendation is if it's been awhile since you've seen the movies, refresh your self on what's happened and who the characters are, I didn't and although I was caught up with in 20 minutes it would've been easier if I had done a refresh of the series before seeing the movie.",F9 - The Fast Saga

I'm exhausted after watching over 2 hours of the zaniest, most unbelievable, schlog of a movie. Physics are straight out of a cartoon, there is almost zero story or motivation for the characters except for drive, drive, drive, get McGuffin device, drive, rockets, space, barbecue, blah blah blah.

Isaac Newton would be rolling around in his grave at the complete misrepresentation of basic laws of physics. And magnetics. And flight. And computers. And DNA.

It's basically just a poorly directed, poorly written spy thriller with the cars/racing coming secondary to all the other nonsense happening on screen (including cameos no one asked for). Yes, the tone of the films started to change with Fast Five, incorporating more action and bigger story, but those were actually good because they kept the core of the movie still heavily focused on the driving.

But it's still fairly true to the typical F&F recipe. I EXPECT utterly unrealistic action scenes. I EXPECT ""cheap"" puns. I EXPECT them to, most likely, not get hurt at all. This is how the series works! They know this, and even showed that, by having Tyrese Gibson's character being skeptical about never getting hurt! That was a fun idea, I think. But anyway.. Cool cars, cool guys, cool girls, lots of mindblowing action. I was entertained!The people who rate movies 1.. I know we're all different, but come on.. Realistically, NO movie is as bad as a 1 out of 10 rating (unless it's like, an hour and a half with nothing but a black screen, or something..).

1014,klauke,The franchise has lost its fire...,4,29 July 2021,"I can forgive silliness... thats a hallmark of this series, but I can't forgive dullness. My biggest gripe with this film, was that it was really quite boring. Where are the insane setpieces from the previous films? That insane tank battle.. the escape across the ice... the bonkers plane sequence on the neverending runway... that heist chase with the massive safe that proved physics don't matter when it comes to fun! This film had nothing. Every action sequence either felt small scale, or was played purely for comedy, and all of them were generally poorly shot. 20 minutes in was probably my favourite action sequence (with a flash of that wonderful previously mentioned silliness) and it did give me hope for the rest of the film, but as the runtime ticked closer to the credits, it became clear that this film wasn't made with the same passion as the previous insane installments.Other issues I had, was that cena's character never felt like a threat - sure, you could create all sorts of narrative reasons in your head as to why that was the case, but the fact remains that ultimately he felt toothless, and as such was a waste of such a massive presence (which cena is).Finally... too many (often inconsequential) characters. Actors from the past as well as (probably) known actor/rapper cameos were thrown in with very little care and no worthwhile payoff, creating a very disconnected feel - more time wasted, when we should be getting down to the action...That said.. the mid-credits cameo scene? Possibly the favourite part of the film for me (and how sad is that! :( ), so yes.. I'll be back for F10!Finally, I won't complain about the space stuff.. I didn't feel it was THAT big of an issue for me, especially when there were so many other fundamental problems with the movie that spoiled my enjoyment - the 'space minions' honestly didnt bother me. It wasn't a highlight, but i didn't hate it. If anything, that sequence was more true to the franchise's insane spirit than the other 80% of the film was.",F9 - The Fast Saga

However i feel like this one jumped the shark a bit. The tone was very messy, since in one scene you have a dramatic flashback about Dom's past, and in the other you have a literal car going to space. I also didn't really like John Cena as Jakob, not only was he not in the film that much, but he also didn't have a lot of presence whenever he was on screen. The action scenes are more over the top than ever, and despite being very well constructed, i never felt like there were any real stakes since the characters at this point are basically superheroes. Still a fun movie though and i recommend it as long as you don't take it too seriously and just go in expecting a fun action movie.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Then the moment of adding in the most random and OTT stunt possible ... I know using NO2 to drive into a concrete post so the rope can wrap around the tyre to swing across a mountain to land the other side, followed by John cena's character driving off a cliff to be picked up by a spaceship in mid air haha.Are the writers on LSD writing this ?Should of stuck to the street racing story lines which is what made these films great.Would of rated 0 stars if it was possible.",F9 - The Fast Saga

If you care about plot, character development, realistic action, characters staying dead, the laws of physics, etc., well, you probably quit watching the Fast and Furious movies by the fourth one.

1034,maximemerz,It could have been better without the PG13 rating,7,21 May 2021,"I'm a die hard F&F and when I first saw Han the trailer I was hyped! After watching the movie i can tell you this though. The story was pretty good and very revealing about the toretto's family's past with flashback's ever now and again. I also think the way that they put Cipher back into the movie was a good idea since she didn't die in the 7th one even after what she did. The movie has a lot of pretty great action scenes in it that did not disappoint, I especially liked a scene were protected Letty and the others by closing the door and fighting the ton of men that were after them preventing them to get to the others. I think this movie would have been a lot a lot better though if it was a lot more realistic like previous F&F movies and also with a higher age rating to make it even more realistic (I can understand that the F&F franchise wants to attract younger audiences too though) and if they introduced Sean from F&F Tokyo Drift into the movie in a different way like seeing him win a race in Tokyo while they met Han would have been a lot better and also if they showed him drive cause not once in the movie did he drive which is quite disappointing since he's obviously really good. So my final thoughts on this movie are that it was quite okay but would have been a lot better if it had stayed more realistic.",F9 - The Fast Saga

They never got hit by a bullet, they go out of space in a fiero, they all keep coming back from the dead, the whole action which is more like a science fiction and way too exaggerated, even Vin diesel is looking too old to go up against 8 guys and beat them all up but he is more and more glorify and more immortal after every movie. Is like he is the one making his own movie and is superman (the torettos). Even the script is way too much and hard to take at times.

It was soo cool that they showed the actors in Tokyo drift, it was nice but I think they have been misused. They did their job best but still there is something Missing. Really I missed Paul walker.

I asked my younger siblings how they felt about the film and they thought it would be better off to pass on this one. Trust me you won't miss a thing. Dom has a brother and he joins in the franchise that's it, that is all you need from this film. The movie tries to be self aware and funny but it comes off so bad. Everyone in my theater room was silent or would laugh at the ""serious"" parts or action scenes in a bad way. It was like watching Sharknado but with cars. This was so bad, the only way I see it being fun is if you have a drink and laugh at how ridiculous the franchise has gotten. Vin Diesel is not the superstar by the way. Scenes with John Cena and Charlize Theron are much more superior then when it cuts back to Dom and ""the family"" it's like watching a SyFy show.",F9 - The Fast Saga

In my opinion, it does not matter how many more movies there are going to be in this franchise, but how to prevent the series from continuing to deteriorate.All we can do is hope for a good and realistic story in the next movie (which has been announced, as of this writing).My recommendation for those who have not yet watched it - watch it only if you have to.If you are new to the series, there is actually no reason for you to watch this movie, don't waste your time (you can watch the older movies instead, which are better).",F9 - The Fast Saga

F9 lacks the heart and soul of the franchises prior entries. The rehashed action was stale and the story boring. Dom has a brother now? How insulting to fans to throw that one out there along with Han's pathetic excuse for why he's still alive. Mia even clearly states in F4 that Dom is her one and only brother, and speaking of Mia - what is she doing here? Did they really expect us to swallow that Brian O'Connor was happy to let her go on some dangerous excursion to save the world while he stayed behind to 'babysit'?! What a total load of crap and a slap in the face to his character. It's becoming very clear that Brian's character is becoming a bit of a headache for writers.Dom and Letty's relationship has been pushed in numerous movies now, yet in this one she was willing to ditch Dom and his son at the drop of a hat to go risk her life and potentially never come home without so much as a discussion.And what's with the ramped up stupidity in this movie? Everyone seems to have injected Captain America's super serum and can smash through concrete walls and billboards without so much as a flinch?I could go on and on... I don't expect an Oscar worthy performance and story, but this was pathetic and insulting for the fans who have stuck by since the first movie and invested in these characters.

I mean we are supposed to suspend belief a little, but not that much!The team from 8 was pretty perfect, it misses the interaction of Hobbs, Shaw and little nobody, strength but also conflict from within.The movie has moved too far from a group to one character, that of Dom, which can be suffocating to everyone else, and it is.More balance and a return to older established characters is what is required. To end a story there needs to be continuity, and those characters who have had a significant piece of the whole storyline need to be able to see it out to completion.You don't bake a cake and forget significant ingredients expecting a reasonable result.Sorry but a let down for me.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Pretty sure if I put an hour of effort thinking, I could come up with great few cast adds that would maybe revive this franchise. Along with a whole new story that would bring it back. Maybe a paul walker type of character was needed. Maybe Vin D had a second brother that was never introduced and came in because of Cena. Idk. Just spitballing. I mean if your gonna keep making more, might as well bring a new paul walker. Vin D is not the same without a strong partner. Just some quick thoughts. This was just a few minutes of literally just writing this review. Bottom line, they should of used real people to rewrite this story.

I'm not going to rant about how terrible this movie was I'll just point out some serious lack of logic.1. Electromagnet. They switch it on and off with a dial which crushes other cars to theirs.. But their car doesn't get affected. Light poles don't get attracted to it until letty wants them to.2. The big ass truck/trailer. I think it's still moving ahead on its back. There's a scene when they are shooting it from the back.. BUT they don't shoot the Tyres..
3. Ludacris trying to explain how space works.4. When Dom reaches Jacobs palace.. Everyone seems to be dancing around cars.. But there's no music.. And makes no sense why they would be dancing around parked cars..
5. The space car - the windows do get iced.. But not the whole window..
6. Haha Roman actually steers the car in space (please NASA hire them)
7. Dominic more like DUMBnic.. Cant understand what the heck he keeps mumbling.. It will drive you crazy.8. Poor Han.. Sorry you had to come alive on this movie..
9. Charlize... Oh boy.. That hair.. Bowl on the head cut.10. You unfold the plot in the first 15 mins of the movie..
11. Next FF10 movie will be a inter galactic war..I could go on and on.. This is definitely the worst movie of all time. The horrible Tokyo sets to laughable Action scenes. Unbelievable physics..

1124,ms-hoofwijk,I felt myself getting dumber watching this,3,13 August 2021,"It is a weird feeling, to actively notice yourself losing braincells watching a movie. I've seen some bad movies over the years and some were good in their bad-ness, some were funny bad or at least told a good story. But this movie.... It is just bad. Bad all over. So here is my opinion as to why I say this.Lets start of by saying that the entire series should have ended after the fourth one, but that is not important now.The story is probably one of the flimsiest things in Hollywood since the Oscars. It is your classic, run of the mill, save the world from generic evil guy #31 because of generic evil plot #152. Nothing special to it.The actors are just... Done. The jokes feel stale. Interactions are not natural feeling. Their motives are just the same as the last 3 movies and that is just boring to watch.The action feels predictable. And for a movie franchise which so heavely depends on its action you would think the writers would come up with something worthwhile?? No this is like a couple of dudes got really high watched the fast and furious franchise and were tasked with writing a new script.""What if like... they went to like, space"" "" yeah and like, you know, Dom had like, a longlost brother??"" Whoooaaaahhh dude!I mean come on!!!!The special effects feel dated and generic. Just explosions and smoke. Nothing special there.The directing was also quite standard for an action movie. Every (fight) scene had to be shot of 26 different cameras all showing a slightly different angle of the action. I counted 4 different angles on 1 punch?!?! I hate this trend so much! It distupts the flow of the action, you lose sight of the story and overal it comes over as cheap way to simulate high-octane action. Just stop.What else is there to talk about? Well maybe the reason why I gave it 3 stars as opposed to 1. Well that is quite easy. Cars go vroom.",F9 - The Fast Saga
1125,orrdaniel398,Two Words - Space Car,6,3 July 2021,"Overall this film was pretty predictable - lots of fast driving, crashes, explosions, and unrealistic CGI. Vin Diesel and John Cena face off and battle each other repeatedly with some pretty forgettable dialogue. But what stands out for me the most is that they sent a car into *space*. That's right, 100 miles into orbit, with the drivers equipped with nothing but old scuba gear. You won't believe it until you see it and then you probably still won't believe it. That's worth the price of admission right there.",F9 - The Fast Saga
1126,richbaker5150,I can only suspend belief so much,1,16 August 2021,"I like the Fast and Furious franchise. I've seen them all, and they were ok up until the fourth installment (Fast and Furious (2009)). The next one, Fast Five, is where things got stupid, and progressively worse with each release.F9 is, in a word, stupid. Movies are meant to be a place where you might imagine yourself in the scene with the actors, or comedy relief, or a heavy drama. This movie makes one question the low standards of the actors. Can you imagine them reading the script, saying, ""This is so damn stupid. But you're paying me how much?? Sure, I'm a Hollywood whore. Why not?""The movie makes me wonder if it was written, directed and produced by dementia Joe and crackhead Hunter on a yearlong bender. What in the actual hell? If you lower your own standards and watch this dreadful installment, you risk coming away 25-40 IQ points lower than where you started. You're much better off watching Gigli or Battlefield Earth.

Granted, the last installment was pretty terrible too - Charlize Theron as Dr. Evil was just a bridge too far for me... Yet I was able to stick around and derive some entertainment from the cool cars & familiar characters. F9 on the other hand, felt like they just grabbed a copy of a Marvel/DC script where a mysterious cube with the power to destroy the world drops into their lap and causes bad guys to come after them. That is pretty much the entire ""plot"". It feels as lazy as the dialog, and it might as well be titled ""Car Chase Shoot 'Em Up for Asian Market many Explosion Buy Dodge"". The opening chase where you have a car chase THROUGH THE JUNGLE..just awful. I mean, you kind of expect the silliness, like why they each have to drive their own car, but seeing Letty become a bulletproof Ricky-freakin Carmichael on that dirtbike was pretty much it for me.

Maybe Han's girlfriend comes back in F10 as Wonder Woman...Apparently, it's possible to install giant magnets in vehicles, and use them to pull cellphones, that are mostly made of plastic and glass, from kids hands... Wait... whaaat...?!?!?!Still on the giant magnets subject, on F9, if you install those magnets on a jet fighter, you can catch cars, mid air, with them...On F9 cars are as soft as a mattress, so falling on top of them won't hurt you, this is not the first time they've done it, but in this movie, they really over play it, but, if you're one of the bad guys, even if you're bigger and stronger than Dom's Brother, those same cars, become as hard as concrete, and will actually kill you.They go to space, using a Pontiac Fiero, that's duct taped to a jet engine and survive, they even make fun about surviving, for as long as they have, without a single scratch.At one point, when Dom is easily fighting 20 plus bad guys, it became so ridiculous that, the only thing missing to turn this into a lame superhero movie, was for Thanos or Darkseid to make an appearance...Most of the movie cast doesn't ""act"" (most of them are basically playing themselves at this point) in anything else besides FF movies and, I genuinely believe that, because it's such an old franchise, both actors and producers, think that fans will go watch it no matter what, just because it's an FF movie but, ratings and reviews really tell you otherwise this time, making this the worst rated movie of the whole franchise.

1159,scottwill-75586,F-nein (Spoilers ahead),5,29 June 2021,"Sad to say I was thrilled going in about another Fast Movie into the saga but clearly the reservoir is running dry on the treads to the storytelling. Very choppy story and relied heavily on CGI stunts and Ludicrous attempt to take the Fast Crew past the barriers of limited creativity and lazy writing are as punchy as the Fast & Furious timeline. The film never got out of park until a would be Han's resurrection and intro of Elle was looking promising but fizzled out quickly. I am sure there will be a a F-10 but we can only hope they infuse some nitro in the writing and the story to elicit interest past what is the biggest flop of the Fast & Furious film saga. Keep the cars grounded and take us back to LA street racing is life and plausible possibilities of laying it on the starting line and keep the covert government agencies off the track. But now that we have gone this far I doubt we can go back. What seemed to be inline with a 007 has taken a sharp turn cheesy one-liners, a Fiero in space looked more like naked gun attempt at stopping a uber lame super rich villain and not so inspiring evil cypher that looks to be our lead for the next up getaway cash for clunkers movie.",F9 - The Fast Saga

I do think though there are some scenes with Terese Gibson's character that felt lazy. I have liked him in previous films, but he's boring this time. They could of concentrated more in Tokyo, Han and Kurt Russell, Sean. Bring in Deckard Shaw, this seems like a trailer for part 10. After the delay, this should of been better. Justin Lin I expected BETTER. Part 10 needs to be great.",F9 - The Fast Saga
1161,realmoviescout,I miss Paul Walker...,4,13 August 2021,"F9 (2021): Fortunately I didn't have to pay to go see this movie because like most of you, I'd be asking for a refund.I was a fan of this franchise early on. That had a lot to do with Paul Walker, the sick imports and street racing. Most of that is gone now. Today it's all stunts that if done in real life, 100 out of 100 times Vin Diesel would die. In F9 they send a Fiero to space to destroy a satellite, launch a muscle car off a cliff only to be caught by I believe a crane's hook? And use electromagnets for most of the action scenes, which quickly becomes repetitive.I rarely use the word cringe but my god was Vin Diesel so cringe in this. Just awful. The addition of John Cena didn't help. He was almost as bad. With a script full of one liners, you can't say these guys forget their lines. Tyrese Gibson as Roman is usually the one who brings most of the jokes to FF, however he mostly fails at doing that in F9. Seeing the return of Jordana Brewster (Mia) and Sung Kang (Han) was nice but they're at best secondary characters with little screen time.By now we know what to expect with these FF movies, crazy action stunts with a mediocre storyline, so it's not really surprising that this film was disappointing, yet they continue to make Hollywood a ton of money. Like a TON of money and with that will come more sequels to the franchise. 2 are in development as we speak.F9 ends with Brian's (Paul Walker) blue Nissan Skyline pulling up to the house where the entire cast/family is having their weekly bbq. Of course we don't see who's driving. That was one of the few bright spots. I'm not too sure where the story will go from here but I'll leave you with this...I miss Paul WalkerThanks for tuning in4.5/10.",F9 - The Fast Saga

This franchise has evolved from a Point Break kind of story to an action packed and world saving franchise. But this movie suffers from forced ties to previous movies, like they did in the sixth, where the bad guy, Owen Shaw, was behind the fourth film's bad guy. This also happens in the eighth movie, where Charlize Theron's character was revealed to be Shaw's boss.All of this aside, I enjoyed this movie for what it was, an action packed film where you turned your brain off for two and a half hours.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Too much of action and a bomb that will determine new world order doesn't sound a new concept at all.Apart from that the fundamental reason why this franchise has worked since FAST 5 is because how they handled HAN's storyline from TOKYO DRIFT and nicely blended it into FAST AND FURIOUS 6 for a good FURIOUS 7.I always thought FAST AND FURIOUS 8 was unnecessary but again they made it.But this one i think is big let down in terms of story and they really need to think where they are going because i don't think audience wants too much action any more. Come on Cars in Space now. And then no surprise elements.CLEARLY THE TRAILER OF THE FILM GAVE AWAY EVERYTHING.NO NOVELTY FACTOR for 200 MIL USD movie.Heard they are going to make 2 more.

1223,benjithemovielover,"Anti-climatic, clunky, and hilariously stupid",4,11 July 2021,"So I just saw F9 earlier and yeah, it kinda sucked. How can you be more stupid and ridiculous as this. As a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, I was more open minded than most people. This was the first movie in the franchise I've seen in the theater and it turned out to be the worst. I knew of the negative reviews on this website, but that still didn't stop me from seeing it in the theater. I went with my mom wanting it to being one of the best in the franchise despite what people said, but my god, this is so stupid. The other movies were a bit dumb, but at least they had a little bit of realism thrown in as well. Here, we have our protagonists being thrown into cars, as well as survive explosions, being incinerated inside flipping vehicles, and even traveling to outer space, and they barely make a scratch and break a sweat. They just go and pretend it never happened.We do get a nice flashback to Dom's father being killed in a car explosion but here comes the first plot hole and continuity error in the movie. In the very first movie, Dom recalled seeing his father getting in the car crashing and the car burning and his father screaming whilst being roasted alive in the flames. In this movie, the car immediately explodes when crashes, killing the father instantly. Did the writers even watch the first movie?? I call BS on that.And we get the biggest plot hole which is Han surviving the explosion in Tokyo Drift which makes the climax and the stakes of Tokyo Drift completely and utterly pointless. It means that Tokyo Drift didn't matter. We get an explanation that Mr. Nobody was there at the time of the explosion and Han SOMEHOW DISAPPEARED WHEN MR. NOBODY WALK PAST!! That's the explanation we get from how Han survived!! And guess what folks, it goes nowhere. We get another subplot about a young woman being saved by Han when she was 10 after seeing her parents killed in a car explosion and that goes nowhere. SO WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT TOO, HUH?!There's a hilariously bad scene where Roman kills some of the bad guys and he supposed gets crushed by a tank and its supposed this emotional scene, but guess what, he survived. This franchise has turned into a comedy now.John Cena falls into the left side of a car and he SOMEHOW SURVIVED!! Yes, we have got to the point where someone fall on a car and be perfectly fine.The most hilariously stupid scene in the scene and the entire franchise is when Roman and Tej are in a car that's attached to a plane and they put on astronaut suits before they actually get into outer space! They also get involved into a explosion in outer space and they SURVIVE!! A HUMAN (or humans) CAN GET TO OUTER SPACE WHERE THEY GET INTO AN EXPLOSION AND HAVE NO SCRATCH OR SWEAT!!! WTF, MOVIE!!! WERE THE WRITERS ON CRACK WHEN THEY WROTE THIS MESS?!!Anyway, that's enough for the review. This movie is unintentionally hilarious, stupid, pointless, and an absolute low in the franchise. Even this review is a better movie and more focused than the entirety of F9. Skip this one if you're a huge fan of the franchise.",F9 - The Fast Saga

I did see this in a larger theatre though and I can see it not being such a spectacle if you dont have a decent home theatre setupThe story surprised me and had a few genuinely emotional moments, Vin was the best he's been in a while and john cena surprised me in this, I can see him getting a few big budget starring roles out of this. Tyrese is lucky they're keeping him around, the dude is straight up not funny., only times I laughed at him was how bad his one liners were...ludacris on the other hand has a few funny momentsIf you can turn your brain off and enjoy a big budget over the top action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously then it's worth a watch.The score of 5.2 is just unfair for how entertained I was.",F9 - The Fast Saga

That's why I enjoy F9 as a entertainment movie, not something big realistic movie(never have been).I was a bit dissapointed that Deckard (Jason Statham) wasn't in it, because I enjoyed his screen-time on Fast and Furious a lot and with F8(my fav of all time), it gaves also a funny aspect to it.

The bad guys are blazing away at the main characters with automatic weapons and can't seem to hit them. They drive over hundreds of land mines ""fast enough"" to not be destroyed. Cars crash at 100 mph into rock and the occupants just get out and go on with their day. It just goes on and on. The plot is just a bunch of corny old tropes and plot lines. The huge electromagnets they use in the chase scene where they are driving down the main streets of Tiblisi are pulling cars off their wheels, but somehow not causing a hailstorm of metal objects, forks, knives, tools, plates and iron fixtures not go flying through the pedestrians bodies ripping them to shreds.It's all good fun but not serious.

They had soldiers shooting them from such a close distance and no one was even remotely hurt.It kinda killed the whole movie for me. Until they went to space. That broke me. Driving a car in space is just too freaking far in my book. I get that they wanted to honor the meme of them going to space but it could have been done with in much smarter fashion.They need to end this soon. Two more movies tops.

The film is probably ok for fans, but for someone who isn't up to date with the previous action the film is completely out of context. Although it is full of action, attention and interest very quickly subside and it becomes boring.

I love the F and F franchise so much. I saw the first movie at a sneak preview and still have the shirt I fought for that was thrown out amongst the packed house. It's with a heavy heart that I have to say this was pretty disappointing in everything except action.If you've watched FF1, you immediately know what the storyline this will follow. I was pumped. Let's go! I want to see some torque wrench face smashing.I don't exactly remember at what point I realized I was watching a disappointing movie. The dialogue and attempts at creating drama just fall flat. Characters from previous storylines are flying into every scene without much of a payoff. Did Lin have a checklist to complete perhaps realizing this movie was shaping up to be a steaming pile.To be honest, I was kind of rooting for characters to just start dying so something new would happen. I'm not even sure what the actual endgame of the villains going for with their new toy, but I wish they had succeeded. That would have been a much better movie. There was nothing new except the even more amped up actions scenes which are the only redeeming part of the movie and the minimum each of these movies owe their fanbase.Y'all knew they would be in space racing cars at some point.Also, magnets are awesome!John Cena??? Check. Dwayne Johnson!!! Nope. Seriously??!! Just stop.Why won't they just deal with Paul Walker's passing in the storyline? Every subsequent film after the one he didn't finish cheapens the sendoff that movie closed with. There is absolutely no way he would just be babysitting while the world was (maybe?) about to end.After 2.5 hours I felt bad for the actors and their obvious disengagemnt throughout the filming. I guess it was bound to happen at some point.You should stay for the post credits to catch a glimpse of the next Shaw v (I came back from the dead) movie.RIP FF.

That's why I expected from this movie to be over-the-top, but it still somehow surprised me.As I mentioned, after the 5th movie, I stopped taking these movies seriously, and just relaxed and enjoyed compilation of 'see what we can do when we have enough money' clips.I gave it a 6 for fun factor (and a lot of unintentional laughs).",F9 - The Fast Saga

1310,TheImmortalAbdi,F9 is a movie for the Fast Fans,10,6 July 2021,"I see a lot of people take shots at this movie even more than with the previous entries in the saga and I honestly don't understand why. Yes, this movie is fun silly, yes this movie has over the top action sequences, so what? This franchise long ago evolved into EPIC SUMMER BLOCKBUSTERS, with cars, action, fights, explosions, gunfire and now we even go to space, TO SPACE! Because the whole team behind this franchise know that we as fans want to be entertained, and if they do in this movie what a lot of people call ""unrealistic"" is because we as fans let them do it loooooooong ago. If any of the previous movies would've flopped in the box office, the saga wouldn't be what it is today, but since this franchise has die hard fans like me all over the world that go see the movies, it is what it is.Now into F9.Basically the movie follows the family fighting against Dom's long lost younger brother Jakob, who is working with Cipher to take over a device that would become a deadly threat to the whole world.The whole cast returns and it's such a delight to see everyone together after 20 years. Everyone gets their time in the spotlight and it's awesome and sometimes fun to see it. Han is back and it's great to see the story of how he managed to survive after Tokyo Drift.The new character of Elle is such a badass. She and Jakob are such good new blood for the team.Speaking of JakobJohn Cena is the best part of this movie for me, alongside all of the flashback sequences that let us know Jakob's troublesome past with Dom and their father Jack. Those scenes are very intense and emotional, and they did them so well that at one point I was actually crying.John Cena brings his A Game and delivers such an amazing performance as Jakob that I sometimes aren't too sure who to root for.This is the beginning of the end of the Fast Saga, with only two more movies left (three if we count the sequel to Hobbs & Shaw), I cannot wait to see where this franchise goes next, and most importantly, how they will end it all and they all can be damn sure I'll be at the theater with my popcorn and soda ready to see everything unfold on the biggest screen possible.Fast Family Forever.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Everything just goes to plan, no matter how ridiculous it seems. 2 characters go into space and crash into a sattelite in a jet powered car and in the next scene they're eating brunch..?

I enjoyed watching cars exploding and people screaming for the first half but I feel like I became to the accustomed to the style of action after awhile.

I think the next step in the franchise should be time travel. Also i don't understand the recent love for John Cena in everything. The dude is all muscles and very little acting ability.

Like them surviving a whole military shooting at them, driving through an active mine field, driving on a rope bridge, and them going in to space in a car that previously blew up???

I am now 25 minutes into the movie and every single member of dom's crew should already be dead 5 times over.

So the casting is horrible why didn't they choose that actor who played young Dom?You just need to put in mind that this is a fictional movie and don't expect it to make sense, then you will enjoy it .

1392,AshleighDillon91,It was better than expected,9,3 August 2021,I will have to disagree with the majority. I actually did enjoy the movie. As far as their survival it can be possible as people do survive the unthinkable every day. A car going to outer space has been done before also in real life so talking about physics and science it can be possible. However I wish they would put racing cars more back into fast and furious because that is what they were. I think if fast and furious went back to their roots to race more and do less action more fans would likely to go see it and not be so disappointed. I don't think getting rid of characters is the best alternative because the characters make the movie as well. So basically we need more fast in fast and furious.

1405,benjaminyaep,Seriously Over the Top and unrealistic,2,25 June 2021,"Grew up loving the Fast and the Furious franchise, and was excited about this latest instalment. I must say that I've left the cinema absolutely gutted of how ridiculous the entire movie was. Let's be real. The Fast and the Furious franchise has always been about the unrealistic and over the top stunts - that is what makes the franchise great, and nothing wrong with that.What becomes a problem is when these unbelievable stunts starts stretching reality. Just look at how Dom's Dodge Charger was able to somehow hook onto the rope of what remains of the bridge and swung accross the cliff like Tarzan, lands rolling on the ground, somehow lands upright, and Dom & Letty left the car with not even a scratch on them? Come on? Yes, stunts need to cool, but not even a scratch?And it is not just one scenario. Look at how Dom leaps off the crashing truck, rolling on gravel ground? Walk away with zero scratches? Is he the Hulk or something? Or has he been injected with the super soldier serum from Captain America? I mean even Captain America bleeds.I have not even touched on the plot. It is the same old plot all over again with zero creativity to it. In my opinion, the entire franchise either needs a reboot with different directors and screenwriters or just end. This latest instalment is by far the worse in the entire franchise.How in the world having a car going to space even a good idea? Roman Pearce & Tej somehow getting to space with car strapped onto a rocket in scuba suits. Somehow getting onto the International Space station, and ending up back on earth. What? Nasa sends space taxis and spaceships up to space that often that they can hitch a ride?I just couldn't comprehend how hilariously dumb the entire movie is. What was a movie that often ends up with movie goers at the edge of their seat, now becomes more of a laughing stock where everyone is laughing at stunts that are just hilariously unrealistic.Just keep driving guys, and never return!",F9 - The Fast Saga

Its a great action movie, not a car movie.The cars don't have new looks, aren't unique and some aren't even cars at all. They are not really even mentioned in the movie, its not about the car and its driver, its just about the driver which is mainly focused on Dom.It is a very well filmed movie, very good special effects and there are funny parts and great parts where you see the characters from older movies come back.The movie is still worth it and great for an action packed movie to enjoy.

Horrible roles, amazing actresses.Other than that... good God! What where they thinking?! That movie is a f... Frankenstein - put together hastily, getting bits and pieces from here and there, just to try and prove how great they are.... and hoping for the best!I hope that the next movie, cause sure there will be another one, will bring us back to the Brazilian vibes, the family moments, the real racing and just to the real world that needs simplicity and not ... whatever that was.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Why not show that in the movie?! And the worst part about the movie was the looks that actors gave to each other in every action scene: what's with the pause, why is it needed everytime someone saves someone else?

Even the explosions, racing, and comedy were a downgrade. The only good thing i got out of the movie was the story between brothers. It was hard to believe how there could be another torero without anyone knowing about it but i like how they play it out.Nonetheless, i don't regret watching this movie and i will continue supporting the franchise.

We finally get to see Dom's backstory (A+ for Vinnie Bennett & Vin Diesel) and of course some long overdue interaction between Letty & Mia! In general it is amazing how many tough women there are in this one (Michelle Rodriguez is the soul of this franchise)
It was nice to meet the Tokyo Drift crew again (even though I was never a fan of the third movie) and Han's resurrection was well written and left room for a more detailed storyline in the final instalments #JusticeForHan. I also enjoyed Roman's self-reflective comments that show this saga just knows exactly what it is!And of course that ending scene hit right in the feels (There's still an empty chair & that famous blue Skyline). It is such a beautiful and respectful way to honor Paul!Justin Lin has always been the backbone of Fast & Furious and this time he succeeds in righting some wrongs made by his predecessor (no offense F. Gary Gray).I waited over 4 years for F9 (thanks to Hobbs & Shaw) and I can truly say it was everything I wished for after such a long time!

Also how Han is the only one that knows that that girl is the key to the God of War device? Just doesn't make sense. The whole ending/climax to the film doesn't mean anything, it feels really rushed and you really couldn't care about what happens to Jakob and their whole plan.

I love all the characters, I've never really had a favorite because they all brought it!!! F9 is no different!!! I'd have to say Roman for the comedic aspect!!! Ever since 2 Fast 2 Furious Roman ""Tyrese Gibson"" has brought the comedy to the franchise with a bang!!! When Roman and Tej ""Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges"" go at it together it is priceless!!!Now I do have to say that I do love Han!!! Sung Kang has done a fantastic job playing Han!!! Ever since Tokyo Drift Han has had a place in my heart!!! Seeing Han alive again after ""dying twice, lol"" was total awesomeness!!!I will be definitely be adding F9 to my collection when it comes out on Blu-ray/Dvd!!!So go have some fun and go watch F9!!!If you are a true Fast and Furious fan you will not be disappointed!!!

The overall conclusion that I came to was that it did what a Fast and furious film does, that being expulsions, fast cars, some unrealistic stunts or actions, and something to do with family.To me the magic of the first films will never be able to be captured again and it is true that they are just becoming cash grabs but I personal don't mind that as long as the film is still entertaining and keeps me interested throughout.The only other annoying past is the fact that some of the 'big' revels are predictable and even in the trailers witch i do not like. Its for reasons like that that I tend to avoid trailers entirely.Besides the few annoying part with dialog, and the very unrealistic stunts, it is overall a decent film for a series that is as long as the fast universe is. So overall a 6/10.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Whoever is writing these films must really not understand why fans liked these films in the first place. Way too far fetched. Bring back the films that used to be all about the cars and the racing with action. This shamble of a film is not worth the watch. Awful.

(and this is a feedback from a writer..who recently watched every other movie before the 9th). Even tho it seems ""random"" that things happen as they are (this also means that character are just there without any context), they've brought the saga to a whole new level. Incredible car scenes, excellent fights, weird Roman dialogue and pure family vibes included. 5.5 /10 is way too underrated. Give it a try and watch one of the greatest.

No real story, no real heart, no real racing, no real feeling of family which is what this movie is supposed to be about! This was literally just to get a paycheck and to put a movie in the books. Every character was a cliche of who they were in previous films. Tej was a tech guy who didn't do anything but fancy himself a fighter, Roman was either worried or having a midlife crisis. Letty just doesn't know who she is anymore. Mia left one family to help family she left in the first place. And Dom has just lost all sense of who he is. I miss Paul Walker and what he brought to the franchise. I'm just glad he isn't here to see what has become of his legacy.

The outcomes of any gunfights or any action moments are so unrealistic that it really makes you tilt, even though I was pretty high at that moment.Athough there were a few nice emotional rewind moments that felt pretty much good.Music choices were pretty much on level.Acting was kinda bad as for me. It felt like I was reading a director's script rather than watching a movie. Every emotion felt like it was organically shown in a movie rather just shown like it simply has to be shown and that's it.In concluding want to remark, that I am not a fan of the sequel, but felt enoughly the emotional parts of the movie, however probably not knowing something important from previous parts.

1506,ypysmcyjx,So many memories....,8,28 June 2021,"This is my first review - EVER - but I felt I need too. The Fast Saga hold so many memories for my family and I. From the very first one! I dragged my husband to watch Moulin Rouge and in return he dragged me to watch Fast & Furious. From the moment that movie started - I was HOOKED. As our kids grew older we would have F&F marathons with their friends - and watch them in order! Fast Foward to this one!I wasn't exactly sure how I was gonna like the whole ""outer space"" scene- it just seemed so far fetched. As I was watching it - I started thinking back to Transformers, Avengers, even the original Superman with Christopher Reece. Every action movie has far fetched scenes- it is what makes them a MOVIE!!!!This movie delivered just what I needed. It shows the reality of loosing someone you love. The way a family comes together and helps each other. The comedy between friends. The way a family always has your back - even in dark times.I love the fact that the vulgarities were at a minimum (yes I am that person who doesn't like to be cussed at by a movie screen or tv) - I love the setup for a possible ""return"" of Brian. I love that I left the theatre talking with family and friends about everything in the movie that we loved.If you made it this far in the review and you are still reading this - DON'T base your opinion of wanting to see this movie or not based on the reviews. If you are a TRUE Fast Saga Fan - you will love this one as much as the others!Until next time - oh and make sure you watch the credits - there is a little set up for the next one!",F9 - The Fast Saga

1545,ueznlzczpch,"10 Is most likely ""Cheated""",1,1 June 2021,"There is no way this is legit 10. The movie is comparable to Transformers 5.(Rated a 2).Look I loved the following recent action hero movies. Spiderman (1-3), Dark Knight, Super 8, Iron Man(1-2), Transformers(1-2)I really don't dislike that many movies. I'm not being cynical. This movie really is just a cluster ..... There's no emotion to the whole thing. Its dull and flat. It also feels very ""PG""Its the definition of cliché when it comes to super hero movies. There's no bar being raised, there is nothing new being done. The entire script is just a bunch of predictable non sense jargon with no meaning. There's no event in the movie where i go wow, that is original. Or go wow this movie gives me emotion and it really immerses me in the experience(Watch the beginning of star trek).My only thoughts is that Walt Disney Pictures did black hat tactics to hype this movie through social networks. I cannot and will not believe people think this movie is worth an 10.I really did want to walk out of the theater. This movie is forgettable and I was very disappointed and let down. This movie really just feels like another ""average"" super hero movie. But the expectation of it being good just makes it worse.",F9 - The Fast Saga

I sincerely thought that with Brian's death it was going to go downhill a little but I then realized that in the Fast world he is still very much alive and is going to make a huge difference in this movie and the 10th installment as well. I also love the fact that women are taking on a larger role in the movie and being more active.

1548,Twisted_Chemist,Would rather forget,3,4 June 2021,"I wanted to like this and I've been a fan since the first one, but I just don't. The last few movies have this pattern of the villain becoming a good guy and while that is a feel good ending in the form of redemption, it leaves nothing desirable. Also, how many dead characters are we going to bring back to life? Letty died in a crash, Han died in a crash, Owen Shaw got thrown from a plane, etc.For simple, over the top action, I guess it is a cool movie. There is very little story line though that is compelling and it doesn't feel well put together. Actually, it is a lot like F6. I watched that one only to find out how Letty was alive and this one was only to find out about Dom's brother, plus how Han is alive (Han's 'death' has been redone too many times also and there was a pretty meager explanation for how he lived). The rest of the story wasn't very interesting.I still watch the movies as a guilty pleasure, but for me, I prefer to consider the end of the series with F5. Ignore the post credit scene and everyone had a perfect ending. That script was also compelling and well thought out. Something I can't say for the movies made since then.",F9 - The Fast Saga

His poor testimonial was an utter fallacy. Whilst it is not compulsory to watch Fast and Furious Nine, it is expected to be a dreadful experience. Following my last viewing of the series, Fast Five, I had to apply antibacterial hospital grade sanitiser to my eyes simply to attempt to forget what I had just witnessed. My hands have not stopped quivering since I shamelessly purchased the Fast Five tickets, similar to that adolescent stuck in a man's body, John Cena, with his quivering hand over his face.

1565,bissosh,It was a so so for a fictional movie that can pretty much be predictable,5,18 June 2021,"First of all the movie was okay not that hype not that comedy. As for action part the movie Roman Pierce have described themselves as invincible ( not a single scratch in movie it self) which some point shuts most of the movie reviewers.Although most of the fighting scene and car stunts were too fancy. The fight scene inside the magnetic truck seems a little bit realistic which was ruined at the end when magnetic function attract only Jacob's Car not surrounding object like it did before.Another thing was when they were inside the bunker and Dom stayed behind and lock the escape route and feel down into water how come. Letty came out when it was locked and save him?? If it was a two way door why didnt she came out at the first place when he was fighting alone? Ok whatever..So far the movie is just okay. I think the acting was kinda let down from the main actor (Dom, Cipher(maybe low screening time) ,letty,) where as John Cena (Jacob) did wonderful acting according to his Role.P. S. I thought Jacob as a double spy that acted as a Rouge agent who actually was under order of my NOBODY to track down Otto's Father (some kind of world leader or something)Lets see what happens in Fast and Furious 10.

But this one has to rank bottom for me so far which is disappointing.The visuals were great, the effects as flamboyant as ever and there were even a few legitimate chuckles. But there was just something missing.It had potential to really underpin a lot of the franchise's storylines, Dom's origins, the return of Han, bringing Tokyo drift which has always sat a bit disconnected to the side back into the mix.But the execution. The final chase felt a bit of a damp squib, a little predictable and borderline tired. They had conquered land, air and sea but I felt shooting roman and Tej into space was a bit of a stretch, even for a series that had always diverted so far from reality. But it never quite felt completely Sci-Fi until then. It detracted from the otherwise more 'serious' tones of the movies.It was also so far removed from all things cars being at its core that it really felt like a bit of a sell-out.An ongoing reference to Paul Walker was a warm touch and it was only the roaring Skyline that really reminded me that we were still watching the franchise and not a spin off such as Hobbs and Shaw.In fast 10, I Think they really need a return to the old-school street racing and authenticity that the first few and even some of the later movies captured which was all but absent in 9.That said I don't think it was 'that bad'. I think it was the first move to slip into switch-off-your-brain territory for me which isn't a bad thing as such but it was certainly the one that really didn't tickle my inner petrol head as I'd come to expect. Maybe expectations were simply too high.",F9 - The Fast Saga

The car chases were subpar and really a chase with a delivery truck. Come on. And well now apparently Dom has an evil twin(yes I know not literally). But has an evil brother that is still beefing about an argument from teen years that has now apparently made him now want to steal a secret weapon and dominate the world. But it gets even more corny. Apparently Twink, Sean and Earl are now rocket engineers. So they strap Tej and Rome into a hodge podge Pontiac Fiero with rockets attached and send them to space to destroy a satellite. Somehow they plow into it without killing themselves and run across a space station. There were a couple decent fight scenes but nothing to write home about. The best one being the scene where Dom takes on a horde of guys and somehow barely has a scratch to show. The end where all the characters reunited is pretty cool but it still fell a little flat with the insinuated Brian appearance in the blue Skyline. Why not have one of his brothers fill in and use the CGI like they did before. Still nice touch at the end but could have been better.",F9 - The Fast Saga

1598,chad_metcalf,The franchise has lost its touch!,5,30 June 2021,"This film was a massive disappointment! I'm a massive fan of the original three films; Tokyo drift being my favourite. I also thought 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were pretty good, whilst I would have preferred a bit more focus on the cars/street racing in the later films being a petrol head, I get that there's more money to be made turning the franchise into a more widely appealing action film. I felt 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 gave the hardcore fast and furious fans just enough of the original street racing focus to keep them happy with a reasonable storyline and humorous moments which made it possible for me to ignore the over the top unrealistic action scenes and CGI! I was very hopeful for this film with the return of Justin Lin as the director because he directed Tokyo drift, which I love! I was also excited to see the return of Lucas Black! Unfortunately the story line was weak, the acting was poor at times, the stunts were beyond ridiculous, the funny moments were forced and unoriginal, and yet again Lucas Black was only given a small role! I didn't like the way they portrayed the Tokyo drift crew as the lame rocket scientists! What happened to the cocky redneck who became the drift king? I think Justin Lin needs to rewatch the first 3 films to recapture the spirit of the franchise. I hope the next one is better and they finally give Lucas Black the role he deserves. I usually love the travel theme throughout these films, but they switch from one country to the next far too often in this film! It would be better stick to a few locations and capture the various cultures in more detail rather than glazing over ten different countries!! This is by far the worst of the franchise. Please don't try to top going into our space in the next one... this has unrealistic action has gone too far (sigh).",F9 - The Fast Saga

1600,kingaj-23114,9 is one too many,4,27 June 2021,"Some will say this should have ended after Paul Walker died, I am one of those people. Yet, F8 was a fantastic film. This one just didn't deliver. Action was tame, unrealistic at times, it just seemed like the same plot as the previous film but not as interesting. Charlize Theron was underutilised, Statham and Johnson were sorely missed and Cena just isn't convincing enough as a villain. Why are they making a 10th one?",F9 - The Fast Saga
1601,rkhan-64790,CRAP STORY LINE COVERED WITH CRAP ACTING,3,27 June 2021,"This franchise should have ended a while back now. First time back at the IMAX today in Manchester and we wished we hadn't gone. The story line is week, and they've tried to cover it up with unbelievable attempts at keeping your eyes at the screen and not nodding off(don't want to spoil it for anyone), inc a car flying to space, I'm not kidding, when it docks with the international space station, I was in stitches. It's littered with attempts of humour and CGI stunts that are ridiculous. Wow talk about milking the cow til it's death, it milked out money today though.",F9 - The Fast Saga
1602,drenchingnuggets,Absolute shambles,1,27 June 2021,"This movie was bare hyped. They forgot to buy cars for a fast and furious movie. Cardi B had the best acting by far, she should be the next John wick.Overall John Cena lost at Wrestlamania 28. He lost all respect when that happened. The rock would have been a better actor for the job. Poor work on the producers behalf.",F9 - The Fast Saga
1603,gprxm,More cars & needs to go back to the original storyline,6,27 June 2021,"I love fast and furious and will continue to watch it even if it's just over the top. I watched f&f 1-3 before watching number 9, I will be honest the parts I enjoyed the most was the flash backs and the ending. The only decent car was the r34 that ""Brian"" drove onto the drive at the end. I just wish they would link it back to how the franchise started in the first place, not with fancy expensive cars and a 3 minute clip of a car meet but people who built their own to race them. No more stupid magnets, submarines or tanks, cars that can fly or a car jumping off a cliff being hooked to a piece of bridge that we all know would of ripped the wheel clean off in reality. Let's get back to reality and not all this rubbish. Although I'd admit I will still watch them no matter what, I don't want to walk out the cinema each time and the best part of the film was the last 5 minutes and the best car that was on the screen for 20 seconds,",F9 - The Fast Saga

1605,cyxmvqt,Best one since Tokyo Drift!,10,28 June 2021,"This movie has some unrealistic scenes (not surprising if you've seen any of the prior movies).

1607,dahh-27270,Playing to be unreal,10,28 June 2021,"This saga began in a certain way and expanded until it is what it is now, for many it lost the essence, but the reality is that the title does it justice, they are literally fast and furious, if we stay in what began being not serious nothing more than seeing cars in races and nothing else. This saga evolved to the point of showing the viewer how a saga that has a lot to teach could go far, without losing the sense of family, an entertainment film that would be based only on that, I don't see why to look for coherence in a cut that only focuses on entertaining, depth of drama would not suit you, nor suspense, action, entertainment and fun is what Vin Diesel offers us and enjoys offering.",F9 - The Fast Saga

As much as I love the franchise it has become Less and less about the cars and the heists that initially drew people in and that's what made people wanna watch the movies. I'm not saying f9 is a terrible movie, you'd have to see it to judge it for yourself, it just wasn't one of my favorites and is definitely not the same from when the franchise first came out.",F9 - The Fast Saga

What would you expect?,8,29 June 2021,"There are 2 sagas that grew up with me and made me company in this journey from teenager to adulthood: ""Fast and Furious"" and ""American Pie""... Therefore, no matter how bad these movies are, it's very hard for me not to like them.F9 retrieves a loose end in the storyline: The death of Toretto's dad and it does it very well. It is also a bridge for something that brought another value to the franchise since F5: Family bonds. And it's where the movie shines: By showing the family meaning, the love, the friendship, the forgiveness, the grieve for a lost one. That's where the movie scores it's points. The ""rest"", it's typical Fast and Furious: cars, stunts, fights. Sometimes so non-sense that makes you think if F10 will have races on the moon or drifting on Saturn Rings.The acting can be awful (John Cena is not an actor), the scenes of humour are not that good, but hey... it's family. And you never turn your back on family. That's why it is so good.",F9 - The Fast Saga
1612,donzilla-84049,The most diconnect from the Fast franchise yet.,4,29 June 2021,"What can I say? I've always been a die hard Fast franchise movie goer, but in the last few films the series has just gotten farther and farther away from reality. The reason why this series became so popular is because of gearhead feeling connect that the movie could be plausible and relateable in real life... Fast forward to F9... Outer space? Really? I hope foe the final chapter F10 they bring the movie back to earth and make it relateable again.The film itself is just an OK action film, but as a car movie... Well it's not really a car film anyways. The cars were the stars before, now they are more of a supporting role.Get this series back on track!",F9 - The Fast Saga
1613,fangfacelucas,This movie is in my top 5 in the fast of furious saga,10,29 June 2021,I loved the stunts. I loved how they put together the story also I loved how they showed the women side of the fast and furious saga.,F9 - The Fast Saga
1614,gvtheobald,2 stars only because Jordana Brewster is so beautiful...,2,3 July 2021,"Bad. Bad bad. Even by Fast and Furious standards this is bad. It's like someone wrote (bad) dialogue for a bunch of random scenes, smashed them together with some car scenes and CGI, and hoped a coherent movie would appear. No plot. Bad dialogue. Incoherent plot. I kept hoping it would end....",F9 - The Fast Saga

Tokyo drift guys all turned into rocket science, tf they used to be cool and drift. The king of drifting became a living meme. But rocket scientist their body features too doesn't add up if they are in the military. Plain out outrageous, than from stealing cars and banks, and becoming rich. Turned into action hero's? They had no training or anything. They stole cars for a living and upgraded cars, I understand like maybe some guns, but they know how to drive a tank tf?

1616,luna-17767,10/10 For Entertainment,10,29 June 2021,"I had the lowest of the low expectations for this movie. I have seen bits and pieces of Fast and Furious before, but the movies didn't interest me. I mostly went to this movie because of my dad and because I got free tickets. I expected to be so bored because I don't even know the characters, or their back stories . . . And I don't care for cars at all. However, I was very entertained by the movie, and I loved that it didn't take itself seriously. They broke the 4th wall a bunch of times and even made references to things like Star Wars. The movie even made me cry a little. Yeah, no one should have been able to survive those stunts. It wasn't realistic. But what action movie even is? It was entertaining, funny, and had heart. I'm not a Fast and Furious fan, so maybe fans were disappointed or hated it. But, as someone who has never seen a Fast and Furious move from start to finish, I had lots of fun.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Some person created a technology that could take over the world. They knew the danger, so they broke it into pieces. Evil people seek out the technology to use it for their nefarious intentions. The good people stop it right at the last minute. One of the main antagonists turns out to be good. The end. I feel like I have seen a movie like this thousands of times.

Obviously, it is not going to match the level of the first 3 or 4 fast movies, we've all accepted fast hit it's prime a long time ago.However, to be fair this was a nice fast-paced watch with a unique storyline, all our favorite characters, a few good jokes and fast cars. It is definetly not one of the most inspiring or well-developed films ever created, but it definitely is not bad. It's a fun watch - just go into it with an open mind as we all are awful critics of everything (including ourselves) nowadays. :)",F9 - The Fast Saga

It blows my mind how the soldiers have the worst aim I've ever seen this is worse then the STORM TROOPERS!!! Also the scene where Dom fought all the soldiers and breaks the bridge with his hands and somehow gets revived by Letty although that door was locked. HE MUST BE SUPERMAN. IDK what's next fighting aliens in another galaxy.

1635,katelynisacat,who needs oxygen when you have family?,10,5 July 2021,"Absolutely iconic movie. First of all, every single action car scene was absurd and they gave Ludacris the line ""As long as we abide by the laws of physics we'll be okay,"" AS IF THEY'VE EVER ABIDED BY THE LAWS OF PHYSICS. They finally went to space, and they just drove through a satellite and ended up fine? Amazing, thank you. The actor who played young Vin Diesel looked nothing like him; it took my brother and I a full minute to realize it was supposed to be Dom, and it was only because of context clues. Also, John Cena is fully a white man and I'm not fully sure how him and Vin and Jordana are supposed to be fully biologically siblings, but I'm still on board. Please just suspend your disbelief, let go, and get into the only movie series who will bring back a character from the dead from 6 movies ago with barely an explanation.

Honestly it felt like the actors weren't even trying at this point.If you are going to watch the F&F you don't expect a realistic movie, but F9 was just too much. No one gets hurt, not ever. Everyone comes back to life. A car flying like Tarzan? They went to space, with a jet engine car? The action is way too much in this movie.Also, everything is predictable. You know how the movie ends 1/4 of the way.In conclusion it is just too much of everything. It is not worth your money!",F9 - The Fast Saga

This flick seemed to be a combination of a bad James Bond movie crossed with a Indiana Jones saga. Too many locations around the world which didn't make any sense. A woman standing in a clear box which was confusing. Too many unrealistic car chase scenes involving humans with super hero powers. A car turned space craft was laughable. Brothers hugging each other that you never felt any empathy for? The movie dragged on, and you felt glad when it finally ended so you could go home.

Starting to get unbelievable yes but within the realm of ok maybe. Now everything is out the window ,turning up in foreign countries within the hour with all the cars and equipment procured. Jumping off cliffs hoping to hang on a rope and don't even get me started on going into outer space with a goldfish bowl on your head,no,no,no.The problem has obviously arisen from the departure of 'Hobbs' ,they have struggled with a script to compensate for this and now created a back story of a never before mentioned brother, a ridiculous story of previous fan favourite 'Han' and a wasted opportunity of a storyline with charlize. My heart breaks for them. Yes it's a franchise and yes there is a pressure to turn out a movie every two years but it would be better wait an extra year for a quality script than to let the fans and the franchise down with this.There were 3 big franchise Bond, MI and FF and it breaks my heart to say they have dropped out of the top three and if they don't reassess they may be going straight to ppv.

We all knew the franchise was steadily worsening but this one takes the cake. I don't think you can make something utterly ridiculous even on purpose.Only question I would like to ask the cast is do they actually care about F&F like we the fans do/did or was it just a big lie right from the start?A person with some kind of self-esteem wouldn't embarrass him/herself this way.P.

Also, let's not forget that because of snow flakes, this movie is the literal DEFINITION of 2021 movies. Including people for DIVERSITY, not TALENT. This movie has been nothing but cringe and outdated memes with jokes that the ""writers"" (if they even had more than 1 that didn't do drugs whilst writting this) didn't even understood at the time of writting.

I love the cast as usual and the commentary makes you laugh.Spoilers below:Han is alive! Dom has a brother who is one of the villians, some of the actors from tokyo drift are here, and at the end they all end up at the original house at the backyard picnic table.. I love how they still act as if Brian is alive because as we know his spirit still is there with them, and you watch his car pull up at the end in his skyline, then the movie cuts.

1746,socialmedia-70368,"I don't write reviews, but this film... You need to be WARNED",1,17 August 2021,"I've watched the Fast saga from the beginning when i had my first car. Like many I was excited at the idea, the concept of a group of people mad about cars coming together and doing some street racing. I remember the Atomosphere the first time, and I remember the first time watching Paul Walker pushing the Green Eclipse to the max.What I can tell you is that atomosphere is completely devoid in this lastest instalment. I will admit it's been on a steady decline since Fast 4, but it's been gone since about 6 really, and 9 feels like the nails in a coffin.The story starts off with Dom and Letty living in a remote location in the US (best guess) with their son Brian. Who has at best a cameo part. No street racing lifestyle in sight bar a few Chargers laying about. In fact there is no street racing in it bar a flashback, which tries to tie in more BS.Then we have set action piece which is totally unbelievable, with many CGI elements looking wonky as hell to me, let alone we swing a car across to an island, which in reality would have ripped the front of the car off and dumped you in the ocean, but hell with physics and making something believable.The stage is set that this film is so far removed from reality that its hard to enjoy, if you have any sense of reality, perhaps you need to be on drugs to enjoy this?I watched the film out of some sense of loyalty to watching the past 8 films and being a diehard fan from the first 3 films, but honestly if this was a standalone film or something else I would have turned it off, it's that bad. Oh talking of past films they bring back part of the cast from Tokyo Drift, lets just say they're used as a comedy piece bearing in mind Sean is supposed to be the Drift King, he's a Clown in this. Han comes back from the dead with some real next level BS of how he's alive, the only thing I appreciate is the time they took to explain it.The end set piece is literally ridiculous, which exceeds the stupidty of the airport scene of a previous film with the 30mile long runway. Which then ends abruptly, with no real resolution leaving it open to the 10th film, but it didn't close out like previous films, it just feels like they went ""well we've done our runtime, lets call it a day and finish this off in 10""At this point to be disappointed is hard as it's so bloody ridiculous that it's hard to be, but if you're a fan of the films which started this, I believe you'll hate it like I did.Paul Walker must be turning in his grave, as he was a petrolhead and this is so far removed from car fandom that it just feels like a kids cartoon.",F9 - The Fast Saga

It sure started to get too exaggerated starting around the 6th movie, but I thought it's still worth watching since it's such a big story now.However, I couldn't stay positive about this movie after about an hour no matter how hard I tried. The scenes are so freaking random. And all of the jokes about the space when the 8th movie was out? It's as if the creators heard us and decided to make it happen. It was a joke, guys! I also would like to mention how awful the CGI is. The physics of the cars moving is only good for a 10 year old. I'm sure they had budget to hire better professionals. And of course they didn't ""end"" the movie and who knows how long they're gonna milk it.",F9 - The Fast Saga

But when you add more and more characters to the movie just to get the movie going and plus to bring back actual dead characters. I was horribly disappointed with the movie that i couldn't help but make an account just for this. The unwarranted humor that is not all the funny. The use of physics that does not make any sense. As mentioned by Mr. Gibson's character they are just gods at this point. Please just please. End the movie saga. It's insulting, infuriating. The only reason why i even watched it in the first place was because i have watched all the movies and grew up with it. And at this point after having watch this movie.

He told me that all the actions and stunts (including car related scenes that look extremely cgi) are in fact 100% real. Tyrese and Ludacris had to recieve special training for the actions they performed, and were actually rescued whilst filming by united international efforts. The acting is superb. In fact, Vin Diesel is able to deliver a line that is more than 10 words! (a whole 23 words!! Amazing) While Brian is not shown, we do see his little Brian. It was an amazing scene that had to be recreated using CGI to showcase his extremely accurate little Brian. However, it is based on photoscans of the real thing. If you plan on seeing this movie with your children, just know that a little Brian appears multiple times in this movie. Once again, I believe that this movie should recieve all awards at the Grammys, The Emmys, and of course the Oscars, except for the Best VFX as there was none. Except for the little Brian that we see multiple times. Oh and physics is so good, that newton himself would be jealous.

We want to see fast cars and explosions and people surviving situations absolutely no one would survive. Because that's funny and entertaining which is what movies are supposed to be.

I saw better things waiting online to order my popcorn. I then heard that this is not the last there is yet one more, which I will not be seeing. Then the 2 loser characters strap a rocket to a 2 door coupe or hatchback and fly into outer space to crash ito a satellite and get recused by Russian cosmonauts. Awful.

The dialogue is borderline insulting my intelligence. The action sequences looked like they were created by a 3rd grader. I heard that Justin Linn's 8 year old son came up with some of the ideas for the film. I don't know if that's true, but Justin should have let his son write the entire screenplay because it couldn't be any worse than what Justin created.Oh, one last thing , in case you are in the fence about seeing this film, they send a Pontiac Fiero car into outer space while wearing scuba diving suits.I can't warn you enough to not watch this movie.",F9 - The Fast Saga

This F9 movie is just a brainless movie with no sense, cars flying to space and dead people showing up alive again.

A piece of art? I don't understand the reviews above. You know what you are going to watch, and the truth is that it quite meets expectations.For me anyway, the one in Rio de Janeiro is and will continue to be one of the best, all subsequent ones have been forgettable.What I do find objectionable is that they still pretend that the character of Paul Walker is still alive, it really is ridiculous and gives a bit of cringe. If they really want to keep its essence, they could film it from behind, I don't know, but it's given too much screen.

It's so awkward to see Dom being such a sweet dad as if had grown up in some Disney featured family.Where did he learned to be such a sweet father?Family... he treats family like his soldier/employees.And his biological family means so much now. (Miss how agent Hobb use to call him ""brother"")I can take how street racers are saving the world, but just so sad to see how characters falling apart.Real people gets old, chubby, soft, whatever.

This installment however we felt as if they are jumping ship with the story and doing what ever they think is cool/ ridiculous to please new viewers, making it more ""hollywood"" if you will and not listening to there long time fans that fell in love with the franchise for its more realistic features and racing of cars. Some of the scenes were almost to cringe and didn't seem like a full effort was put into this movie by the actors and writers that we all know and love. I did how ever enjoy the throw back scenes to the back story of Doms life with his father, bringing back Han , and keeping Paul still in the universe in small ways.

1875,jsteffler2005,Worst of the series,1,1 July 2021,"As a die hard fan of the series, I wanted to like this movie. I went in knowing there would be some far fetched action scenes but this one took it to a whole new level.Its so bad that they even make jokes about how far fetched the action scenes are in the movie. With not wanting to give away too much. Here are some of my issues with this movie.First of all, the story line is awful. They maybe give a 5 minute build up before starting all the action stuff. Side note, I know Dom named his kid Brian out of respect for Paul Walker's character, but they still act like Brian is alive but retired. So why not name him Paul in the movie instead of Brian. Just a thought.Second, the bridge seen is way over the top. You stretched it with Tej, but the whole Tarzan swing by Dom is too much.Third, I understand wanting to keep Mia in the movie. Its not her fault Paul Walker died but bringing her in and saying Brian is home babysitting all the kids is laughable. Brian would not let his.wife go save the world and him just sit at home.Forth - Trying to introduce John Cena's character into the mix was ok. This movie would have been great if they would have just done a prequal with him and Dom growing up. Bring back some of the old style street races that made us all fall in love with this movie.Fifth - Cardi B doesnt need to make an appearace in this movie. Periodsixth, I understand wanting to keep some of the old characters relavent to cut them a check from this franchise, but did we need to make Lucus. Black and Bow Wow characters seem dumb and crazy?And Lastly, The whole flying a car into space was the worst. So many questions I could ask. How could the car survive space. The government just lets them basically board the spacestation, though they are able to make it back home for the barbeque and all get back to normal everyday living.Just please stop. The franchise should have just stopped with 7. You do not need to compete with Marvel if that was your plan.

It has emotion, action and total craziness, seriously what more could you wish for in this kind of movie? The characters are still all there in there glory behaving exactly how you expect them too.

1912,ItsBhoy,"A return to the main storyline, regardless of new characters & sequences",7,10 June 2021,"As a long time fan of the Fast Saga, I know die hard fans were disappointed with the last 2 films in the series (F7 & F8) because the story of Sean Boswell making his return was not carried on after the short scene he had in F7. Justin Lin's departure from directing was mostly the cause of that, and the storyline went way off track into the 8th film.I am pleased to say that Sean Boswell returns (as well as a couple other Tokyo Drift characters) and has a much bigger role (still not that big), and the main storyline seems to be back on track regardless of all the new characters and tech that have evolved into the series, like Cipher (probably the most useless character the franchise has ever seen)The action was... so-so. The film looked great and sounded great in IMAX but overall the action was over the top corny & sloppy, which I know is a staple to the fast franchise, but they took it way too far in this one. Some of the action scenes are fun and frantic but the CGI and plot convenience fall short in terms of being exciting. Didn't get on the edge of my seat with the action like I did on F5 and F6.In conclusion, the movie is very nostalgic and refreshing at the same time, it was cool to see the return of the Tokyo Drift characters and to see that the storyline is back where it's supposed to be with the inclusion of the newer characters.Also, there is an end credits scene, which was also pretty surprising! Overall 7/10 not the worst one in the franchise. 4 was probably the worst one.",F9 - The Fast Saga

What started in 2001 as a modestly budgeted ""Point Break"" ripoff has exploded into one a box office behemoth the size of James Bond, and Dom's crew has evolved from a gang of low-rent gearheads into an international unit of government-funded super spies or something.And that's awesome. Where these movies are going, they don't need roads. Or scripts. Or any pressing reason to exist. Sure, the last two installments of this hi-octane soap opera have fallen well short of the nigh-perfect ""Fast Five,"" and it's increasingly clear that ""Tokyo Drift"" will never be topped for sheer personality (or sick drifting, natch), but the series has weathered all sorts of ridiculousness - even amnesia! - because it's never betrayed the fundamental bonds that hold it together.",F9 - The Fast Saga

Whoever thought the car in space was a good idea needs kicking out of the movie business for good. They've totally ruined every film that went before this one sending the series into a parody of itself.

2012,joeyxennial,Ridiculous thrill ride of none stop action,7,25 June 2021,"The newest edition to the Fast and Furious franchise is a complete non-stop thrill ride with over the top ridiculously insane stuns...and it is GREAT.I persoanlly got with some of the backstory elements centered around Dom (mainly towards the end). It seemed to go against the over all narrative of what the movie had been working towards but again, it is a mindless over the time action fest.A lot of what the movie offers is similar to other movies in the franchise with attempts to have sudden plot twists and surprises that everyone can see coming a mile away.Personally for me, I didn't mind that. Sometimes I enjoy sitting down to watch a movie that I can just enjoy without much thinking. The acting is top notch like always and some surprise guests along the way.If you are a fan of the past installments of the franchise then it is a no brainer, GO SEE THE MOVIE! You will not be let down. I was entertained throughout the entire movie. There was one sequence that happens around the middle of the movies that felt unnecessary and caused an awkward pacing for the movie.Of course, this isn't a movie you plan to see for a powerful story. This is a movie where you have a beer in one hands with a burrito in the other being entertained by over the time unbelievable stunts that defy reality. And personally, I need more of these types of films in my life.Beside to stick around during the credits as there is a teaser scene with some surprises.What did you think of the movie?Is it the worst one in the series?What was one of your favorites scenes?I hope you enjoy summer blockbuster of madness!",F9 - The Fast Saga

This movie is 0% science fiction. Just action and dumb jokes. AND THATS OKAY. This is a fast and furious movie. It not meant to be scientifically accurate nor realistic. It is also the 9th movie in the saga, so if you're expecting originality you're just naive at this point.I honestly don't get all the angry reviews? What did you expect???? THIS. IS. A. FAST. AND. FURIOUS. MOVIE.

It was so incredibly ridiculous and absurd and bad that all we could do in the audience was laugh. I mean these aren't Oscar worthy movies generally, but they're at least enjoyable and have a heart. This movie, they tried to be meta and make fun of themselves for their ridiculousness but it didn't land. Vin Diesel is not a good lead actor and he didn't have Statham or The Rock to carry the movie for him this time (sorry Cena). The great actress that is Charlize tried to act her way out of the bad dialogue, so I gotta say ""we see you, girl."" The only times we laughed with the movie and not at the movie was from a few lines by Luda and Tyrese.Gotta say, Hobbs and Shaw was better.

From what started out as a cool, boundary stretching, fast cars, beautiful people and action packed movie franchise has ended in absolute rediculousness. F&F9 suffers massively from lazy writing, very poor acting and an aging cast that should probably think about saying no if approached for F&F10.

While not based on reality, most of the ridiculous stunts have at least a minute plausibility to them that allow you to suspend disbelief.But with this entry, they have taken that to all new levels. It's really just now an exercise of ego and how far they can push the envelope in ridiculousness.Strapping a Fiero to a rocket and launching it into space was just beyond stupid. And then ""driving it in space, only to be rescued by the space station? It's no longer a car movie, or a family movie, it's now a poor attempt at a lousy B movie.I've enjoyed all 8 of the previous entries, they are just fun, but this one just went way too far into the stupid to the point that there's probably no way back for the franchise.Maybe next time they'll put a nuclear rocket on a Pinto and launch it at Russia, or have Vin Disel Transform into a charger.",F9 - The Fast Saga

For me, the best moment is the last one, when we can see Brian's car. It really warmed my heart to know they keep remembering Paul and still make this small homages/tributes to him. This scene made me give one more star than what i think it deserved.Besides that, there are so many things wrong with movie...
First, by working with magnets...They should not attract only the things you want. They will also do it with the unwanted things and 'civilian assets' aswell, even if you don't want to. How they made it look like it always worked as they pleased...Secondly, they we're supposed to be the best at driving cars. They were hired to do so before...Now, I wonder how they get to be so good at everything, in a way that they survive a military attack (and so many other, that would require some abilities besides driving a car).At last, i think it got a bit dull for being a way too much ""Dom-centered"" movie. It has action, but until we get real action, there is Dom everywhere, and not much of the Fast Family.

But here's the thing, after being a long time fan of the franchise I feel like the movies have gone too far from what made the series so special. It was about fast cars and the feeling they give you. In the first movie Dom even says that nothing else matters during those ten seconds or less, including the shop and the family. Seeing where the series has gone hurts a little because it is no longer what i has fallen in love with. Yes, things change and evolve over time but because of that it is no longer what it was. Us fans are not hating on this movie because we like to hate, we hate that the fast and furious we grew to love is being left in the rear view mirror and no one seems to care. We just want to see the fast family come back to the streets racing around and getting into some trouble.Maybe Universal can capitalize on both groups of fans and make a new series. Reboot the Fast franchise and bring it back down to earth, to the streets with Dom and Brian's kids just getting their license. Make a separate new series that is all about having crazy fun to satisfy everyone who just wants to enjoy a movie at the theater. I know there are millions of dollars on the line with an idea like this but it would make a lot of people happy and I think that's worth it. It's like Han said in tokyo drift, you make choices and you don't look back.If you made it this far thanks for reading and happy movie watching.",F9 - The Fast Saga
2062,abhooshmand,Not too bad guys,7,4 August 2021,"It wasn't so bad at all. It's action movie, what do you want? You want some race cars, you'll see in the movie.",F9 - The Fast Saga
2063,dadomawad-20087,"Maybe they went too far, but it's def entertaining and worth the watch",9,21 July 2021,"Well, maybe they went too far with this one.Especially with the space trip (it shows that in the trailer - in case you think it's a spoiler)
But... It was an awesome movie.And as Joe Rogan would say:
""I'm real. I don't want to watch something that's real, too.""
And I think he's right in some way.What makes the movie exciting is this element of un-reality.The movie was very entertaining also,
I def recommend you watch it.It's filled with action and excitement.",F9 - The Fast Saga
2064,tediwanto,HINDUSTANI MOVIE,1,2 August 2021,"If u never seen a Hindustani Movie, then F&F are likely the same. So creative even your brain can't digest it. It will exceed your imagination to the most. What happened to F&F? Never expect this movie to be so unrealistic & totally not logic. Started to see unrelevant scene during at the jungle, and continue watching hoping there wouldn't be same kind of rubbish scene. Then Roman scene added up, the land mines and lastly I stop watching after Dom & Lety scene jumped the cliff with their car..ended up reading all the comments here and i found it more entertaining than the movie 😂🤣",F9 - The Fast Saga
2065,brsiddhantofficial,All I'm missing is Superman in this movie.,1,29 July 2021,This franchise is going Superhero day by day. I still remember the First movie and now we get this dumb movie? That's an insult to the franchise.Next they going to fight darkseid and defeat him before justice league! May be Dom will crush him with his car and use giant magnet to crash his spaceship!,F9 - The Fast Saga
2066,jmeredith-77564,"Pure and utter garbage, pure and utter rubbish.",1,22 August 2021,"I paused the film half way through to write this, it is that bad, really bad, worse than Howard the duck and Hudson hawk, avoid at all costs. Don't get me wrong I don't mind a bit of cheese and escapism but this is another level. No storyline, terrible wooden acting, it's just a demolition derby on the big screen. From crashes and falls no one could survive, dream sequences that are worse than Bobby Ewing in Dallas episodes, neither that suddenly are mentioned when we've we've not heard about them in the last 15 years, to a car being blasted in to space after being blown up 2 days before, with 2 guys wearing diving suits and duct tape meeting up with the international space station. Total and utter rubbish. End the franchise now before you're the laughing stock.",F9 - The Fast Saga
2067,fred_cruz-84269,Ridiculous.,2,15 October 2021,"Never wrote a review on any movie but considering the huge disappointment of this movie and the frustration of the wasted time in this ridiculous movie I feel like sharing it. Everything in this movie is TERRIBLE. From the characters, the story, the effects.. completely ridiculous. Destroyed the mystic around the whole saga and made everything a joke.",F9 - The Fast Saga
2068,cxbrown-85465,What more could you a-holes want?,10,25 June 2021,Did all you jabronies spend the last year getting dumber? This movie is fast AND furious. A true piece of art. People giving one or two star reviews don't understand cinema OR family.,F9 - The Fast Saga
2069,the_spawning,Was this written by a 14 yr old boy?,2,21 June 2021,"This movie is pathetic, easily the worst of the franchise n I've enjoyed at least half of these moviesIt's like they've written themselves into a hole to just go bigger n crazier every movie, as if they're trying for a Mission Impossible, or a Marvel movie but they just do not have the skill or talent to pull it offEvery character is 1 dimensional, believable physics are non existent, i tried to think of the movie as a live action cartoon but honestly I don't think it's self aware enough to even make that work2/10 n that's being generous.",F9 - The Fast Saga

2073,gladiator000777,Just enjoy it :),7,1 August 2021,"The only thing wrong, is that in the description "" FANTASY and COMEDY it's missing in addition to ACTION, ADVENTURE, CRIME"" beside that it's quite fun and also has a good past story.So stop trying to compare with the first 2, because that ain't gonna happen again, and it's quite better than some others 'episodes' in the saga :)",F9 - The Fast Saga
2074,huszaini-15182,Using car can travel to satellite?,3,1 September 2021,"It's like watching cartoon when we have seen travel to satellite by modified car? This screen really unrealistic that bring down my excitement, but i still enjoy the car chase and action.",F9 - The Fast Saga
