0,MartinHafer,"Not Mel Brooks' best film, but pretty close",9,10 June 2007,"The career of Mel Brooks is much like that of Woody Allen in that both of them did their best stuff in their earlier years when their films were just plain funny. After a few films, Allen's got too introspective and artsy and Brooks' became so juvenile and cheap that both ""geniuses"" became intolerable to watch to many past fans.Young Frankenstein is one of Brooks' earliest films and like THE PRODUCERS (his first and best), it is so hilariously funny that I don't mind seeing them again and again. So why did I like YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, exactly? Well, the acting was superb. I particularly loved Gene Wilder (particularly during his speech while holding a scalpel) and his sidekick, Marty Feldman,...though Cloris Leachman was also terrific as Frau Blücher. And while the film lacked the subtlety and grace of THE PRODUCERS, it was silly and dopey but still restrained compared to later Brooks films. Plus, it had a lovely black & white look that really was a wonderful homage to the Universal monsters of the 1930s.I know this will ruffle a lot of feathers, but his equally famous BLAZING SADDLES was, for me, the beginning of the end of Brooks' genius. While SADDLES had many wonderful moments, there was absolutely no restraint and the end degenerated into a horrific and stupid mess. Like Jerry Lewis, after a while his films were practically unwatchable, as there was no one on-hand to say ""enough"" or ""perhaps you might want to make this scene a little more subtle"" or ""doing a comedy about homeless people just can't work"".",Young Frankenstein
1,TheLittleSongbird,My personal favourite Mel Brooks film,10,14 September 2010,"I am fond of Mel Brooks' films, and for me Young Frankenstein is my favourite of his and also one of my absolute favourites of the genre. It is wonderfully loopy and an ingenious send-up of universal horror clichés. Young Frankenstein is wonderfully shot in a sumptuous black and white, while the costumes, sets and make-up are wonderfully kooky. The story is fun too, while the script is hilariously quotable and Mel Brooks' direction is great. What gives Young Frankenstein real staying power is the marvellously done Puttin' on the Ritz musical number, the brain depository(outrageous to the point of being hilarious), the scene with Igor behind the book-shelves when they were looking the skulls(the facial expression and the breaking into song kills me every time), the old dad speech(then he just starts eating again), the hermit setting the monster's thumb on fire and the performances, with Gene Wilder giving one of his best performances as the infamous baron's grandson, and Peter Boyle almost stealing the show as the monster. The supporting performances are also a delight, Madeline Kahn's bride, Gene Hackman's blind hermit and Marty Feldman's hunchbacked Igor are very memorable. Overall, hysterically funny and kooky. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Young Frankenstein
2,bkoganbing,"""AH, SWEET Mystery Of Life At Last I Found YOU""",7,2 December 2009,"Mel Brooks set his comic genius to satirizing the horror film genre by taking one of the classic Universal horror characters, the monster created by Baron Von Frankenstein. Young Frankenstein brings the saga of the monster saga into the first half of the 20th Century. After several generations of experimentation with the origin of life, do you think that in Young Frankenstein the current scientist has finally got it right?Well to find out you'll have to see Young Frankenstein and Gene Wilder's take on the mad scientist, the current 20th century version of that most misunderstood family of geniuses. Fascinating though that some of the same mistakes were made in bringing the monster played by Peter Boyle to life. Didn't they watch any of the old films?However when physical science fails, psychology takes over as Wilder just thinks it might be a problem of soothing his fevered brain. The monster is also given a sex life in Young Frankenstein as Cloris Leachman finds certain attributes most attractive. In the end though an operation on that electrically charged table seems to solve both Boyle's and Wilder's problems.Funniest scene in the film is when Wilder decides to take his show on the road after teaching him a few human type tricks. Puttin' On The Ritz was never done better on screen than that song and dance duo of Wilder and Boyle. It all comes to no good though when Mel Brooks borrows from King Kong to turn the event into a disaster.Kenneth Mars does a marvelous imitation of the maimed Lionel Atwill from Son Of Frankenstein, borrowing a little from his Nazi playwright from The Producers. Listen closely and some of the best lines are thrown away by Marty Feldman as the hunchbacked assistant Ygor, pronounced EyeGor in this film. Teri Garr has some good moments as Wilder's Valley Girl type assistant Inga and Gene Hackman in his one scene as The Blind Man is hilarious.Fans of the zany humor of Mel Brooks should not let Young Frankenstein get by.",Young Frankenstein
3,Leofwine_draca,Affectionate tribute to the Universal horrors of old,6,5 September 2016,"YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is a Mel Brooks horror spoof that's oddly unfunny and rather serious when watched in a modern light. As a film it's very difficult to criticise because it's certainly above average in terms of quality. The cinematography and the set design are all exemplary, a real tribute to the horrors of old. Mel Brooks's direction is assured and Gene Wilder is a natural fit for the befuddled mad scientist who finds himself undertaking a very strange odyssey.The only issue I had was with the script, which is never quite as funny as it should be. There are some very funny moments here but they seem few and far between in a film which is a bit overlong and repetitive in places. I'd rather take something sillier like SPACEBALLS than sit through this again, for instance. That's not to say that YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is a bad film, because it's certainly not. Marty Feldman is excellent as the hunchbacked Igor and everything that comes out of his mouth is funny. Peter Boyle makes for a memorable monster and the interlude with Gene Hackman's blind hermit is the highlight of the movie. I guess I was just expecting more from a film I had never seen with such a strong reputation.",Young Frankenstein
4,SnoopyStyle,"Lots of Mel Brooks zaniness, some work, some not so much",7,19 October 2013,"Dr. Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has been living down his infamous grandfather but finds he has inherited his castle. There he finds hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman), blondie Inga (Teri Garr), and the old housekeeper Frau Blücher (Cloris Leachman). Although he had dismiss his grandfather's work, he rediscovers the old experiments and recreates the monster (Peter Boyle).This is a daring gamble by Mel Brooks to shoot this in black and white. It worked out for him. I can imagine if this was in color, it would look cheap B-movie camp.There are some hilarious bits like Teri Garr 'rolling in the hay'. It's somewhat uneven with the zanny Mel Brooks jokes. They just keep coming. Some hit, but not all. Although Puttin' on the Ritz is incredibly hilarious.",Young Frankenstein
5,Hitchcoc,I Think I'll Watch It Again,9,7 November 2001,"I can't watch the original anymore without giggling. I personally believe it is Mel Brook's best, although The Producers is nearly equal. Taking the sad and scary Frankenstein original, using its sets, putting the reluctant Frederick into his precursor's milieu, is wonderful. Granted, every gag doesn't work, but there is so much that to list them all, would take forever. My favorites are--When Frederick asks Igor if he would like something done about his hump (which seems to change sides now and then), the reply is ""What hump""? The scene at the dinner table following the ""failure"" to revive the creature--followed by the ""said-a-give"" game of charades. Then, we have the monster visiting the old blind man (Gene Hackman) and practically being killed by him. Finally, the presentation of the monster to the pompous scientific community--""Puttin' on the Ritz."" This doesn't do justice because there are bits of schtick going on . Frau Blucher, Terri Garr and her thick German accent (Moochel instead of Mutual).Marty Feldman and Abby Normal. The list goes on. This is such a gem. With ""Blazing Saddles,"" Mel Brooks didn't seem to know when to quit. This is a masterpiece and deserves to be on the same shelf as the wonderful originals.",Young Frankenstein
6,Prismark10,Putting on the Ritz,8,8 September 2013,"Spoofs are ten a penny these days but Young Frankenstein had so much care and attention put in by Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder. It was fresh and innovative.What works is the atmosphere, filmed in Black and White and evoking the sets, location of the Universal 1930's Frankenstein films.You are easily brought into the atmosphere which gets regularly punctured with jokes, one liners and visual jokes such as the enormous knockers on the door as they arrive at the castle.The cast of Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman, Terri Garr milk the laughs for all its worth.Gene Hackman is a hoot as the blind hermit which sends the monster scurrying after he offers cigars. Feldman's Igor is the best and both Kahn and Garr are sensual and sexy.Almost 40 years later, it is still mad and funny.",Young Frankenstein
7,mark.waltz,Let's hear it for the Zipper Neck!,10,8 July 2019,"Everything is absolute perfection in this hysterically funny spoof of all of the Frankenstein movies that Universal made between 1931 and 1943, although other than a howl heard as Gene Wilder's grandson of the original doctor makes his way through the foggy mist after coming into Track 29 at the Transylvania Station, there is no mention of a werewolf. Mel Brooks and Wilder have lovingly taken pretty much every other detail from those films and utilized them one way or another, and the result is a comic masterpiece that became a classic immediately upon release. A superb ensemble cast of regular Brooks players deliver the goods, and many lines have come to live on in film immortality.Who can forget the horse's whinny every time the character of Frau Brucher (Cloris Leachman) is introduced or identified? The metalic arm of a local law officer (Kenneth Mars) ripped off by one of Frankie boy's previous creations when he was just a child? A show-stopping production number to Irving Berlin's ""Puttin' on the Ritz""? And of course, Igor's (Marty Feldman) declaration of ""what hump?"" when Wilder offers to fix it (and the funny way it moves from side to side to side......)The very same year, David Niven got to parody ""Old Dracula"" (done much better by Brooks several years later), and that film is lost in the time warp of bad horror spoofs, while ""Young Frankenstein"" is remembered by anyone who ever saw it. To see it again after along time, I got to see details I had missed before, and having seen all of the previous ""Frankenstein"" movies since that last time, I so much more appreciated everything that I had missed in previous viewings. The comic genius of everybody involved becomes more appreciated, with Madeline Kahn deliciously eccentric and Teri Garr outrageously sexy as WIlder's fiancee Elizabeth (so concerned about her taffeta dress wrinkling) and lab assistant Inga (who enjoys a good role in the hay), Leachman very dour as a heavily accented housekeeper (""Ovaltine""?), Feldman recalling his late grandfather who worked for Wilder's late grandfather, and of course, the presence of Peter Boyle as the monster (he ""with the abby normal"" brain) whose increased in size body parts bring on some delicious toilet humor from Brooks that even the ladies have fun with.To really pay tribute to the old movies, this was beautifully filmed in black and white, and credits mention that the original laboratory equipment was from the original film. The bit players are also very funny, from the village elders and angry townspeople, to the old man in Wilder's opening demonstration, to the kid at the train station offering Wilder a shoe shine, to the bickering couples speaking both English and (presumably) Hungarian on Wilder's train trip. This is the type of film you can watch over and over again and find new things to laugh at, as well as laugh again at jokes which have been repeated many times over the decades. (""Walk this way!"") Kahn disappears for much of the film, and Leachman's footage is somewhat limited, but they make the most out of their smaller parts, and the cameo by Gene Hackman as the blind hermit is a masterful piece of comedy and timing. I know that if I'm blue and don't know where to go to, I will slip out my DVD of this classic, and I too will be ""Puttin' on the Ritz!""",Young Frankenstein
8,classicsoncall,"""My grandfather's work, was doo-doo!""",10,11 September 2006,"I was all set to turn in last night when I saw ""Young Frankenstein"" in the TV listings for the Fox Movie Channel without commercial interruption. Can the movie really be over thirty years old? This flick is as refreshingly funny as when it first came out, and a wonderful showcase for the comedic talents of everyone involved.Even though the entire film is hilarious, I'm sure most viewers have their favorite bits. I bust a gut whenever I hear Igor's (Marty Feldman) 'take the bag response'. And for sheer genius, the 'Puttin' on the Ritz' number has me rolling each time.Not only does director Mel Brooks send up the original 1931 classic, but also it's offshoots, 1935's ""Bride of Frankenstein"" and 1939's ""Son of Frankenstein"". Horror fans will recognize the references, done to exaggerated but laugh out loud effect. It's a blast that Brooks was able to locate the lab equipment props from the original film to use in his spoof, how much more authentic can you get?There's not a single reason anyone should miss this flick. This is the standard by which all film parodies should be measured, with respect and a bushel full of laughs - Blucha!!!!",Young Frankenstein
9,gavin6942,Not Sure Why This Gets the Raving Appreciation It Does,7,23 August 2010,"Victor Frankenstein's grandson has inherited his castle and everything in it. Although at first hesitant of embracing his controversial work, he soon changes his mind when he realizes what this would do for his career and science. But, some problems arise when trying to revive the creature...""Young Frankenstein"" is hugely popular, scoring 8 out of 10 on IMDb and considered by many to be Mel Brooks' best and one of the funniest comedies of all time. Is it good? Yes. Is it worth seeing? Yes. But I neither think it's the funniest of Mel Brooks' work (""History of the World"", ""The Producers"" and maybe even ""Silent Movie"" are funnier) or one of the greatest comedies. Maybe it's not aging well or I just don't get it, but I just don't get it.The bulk of the jokes are vaudeville and slapstick takes on the classic Universal Studios version of ""Frankenstein"", even going so far as to use many of the same props. And while some of the scenes stand out as funny (the ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" scene, for one) the bulk of the plot is very nearly the same as the classic film. I respect the homage, even the use of the black and white film, but it does not deviate enough to be unique in my mind.In contrast, consider Brooks' ""Spaceballs"". Yes, it is a parody of ""Star Wars"". But it does not follow the plot too closely, deviates in almost every way, incorporates other plots and science fiction references... and has a whole variety of humor styles mixed in. While maybe not the best of Brooks' work, this film is a much more solid comedy and stands up better for a variety of audiences. (IMDB rates it lower, but I cannot agree on that.) Marty Feldman (Igor) is often overshadowed by his co-stars and Brooks, but he makes a strong Igor, and his eye condition could not have been better utilized. This character is the one clear improvement from the original film, and should not be overlooked.Gene Wilder (and Gene Hackman) were both great, of course. Many consider this to be Wilder's best role. I simply cannot accept that Frankenstein, as great a character as he is, somehow trumps Willy Wonka. As made clear when Johnny Depp -- a brilliant actor -- tried to be Wonka, there is no replacing Wilder, even by the best stars of our day.Don't get me wrong. The film is great, the directing and cinematography are excellent. The cast is amazing, particularly some of the supporting cast (like Teri Garr as Inga). But to say this is Mel Brooks' best film, one of the best comedies of all time or Gene Wilder's best role is just not correct, in my opinion. A second viewing might change my mind, but for now I would like to be convinced that this film is more than ""above average"".",Young Frankenstein
10,lee_eisenberg,"Pronounce it right, Herr Doktor!",10,11 October 2005,"Can you imagine the first time this movie came out? Everyone must have died laughing! The plot of course has self-deprecating Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder, and you know how to pronounce the name) suddenly deciding to carry on his grandfather's work with the help of wisecracking Igor (Marty Feldman, and you know how to pronounce it) and the very sexy Inga (Teri Garr). Peter Boyle is a hoot as The Monster, as is Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher (cue horse sounds), Kenneth Mars as Police Inspector Hans Wilhelm Friedrich Kemp (you may recall the screwy arm), and of course Gene Hackman as the Blind Man (espresso, anyone?). Mel Brooks really pulled off a great one here, spoofing every Frankenstein movie from the '30s. ""Young Frankenstein"" is a classic!",Young Frankenstein
11,jboothmillard,Young Frankenstein,8,3 January 2006,"From director Mel Brooks (The Producers, Blazing Saddles), I remember seeing this once before, but seeing it a second time really helped me appreciate it possibly even more. Basically young neurosurgeon Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder), grandson of the infamous Dr. Victor Von Frankenstein, has spent years living with the fact that his grandfather cut up bodies, made one and brought it to life. This looming over him he tries to live normally, ready to marry and settle with fiancée Elizabeth (Golden Globe nominated Madeline Kahn), and wanting his surname pronounced differently. Then he finds out he has inherited the castle of his grandfather where the infamous experiments were carried out, living with big-eyed hunchback servant Igor (Marty Feldman), pretty lab assistant Inga (Teri Garr) and old housekeeper Frau Blücher (Golden Globe nominated Cloris Leachman). Blücher by the way is German for ""glue"", which is why the horses always panic whenever anyone says the word. One night, Frederick and Inga find the secret passage way behind the fast revolving bookcase, and that is when they find the laboratory where the incident happened. Reading through his grandfather's books, Frederick is convinced that he could create a creature from dead tissue all over again and this time succeed. Obviously it was due to fail when Igor took the wrong brain and he misread abnormal for ""Abby Normal"", and when the Monster (Peter Boyle) wakes up it is chaos. The Monster does escape at one point and hang out with a Blindman (Gene Hackman), Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars) with the stiffly adjustable wooden arm starts the search for it. Frederick does get it back, and there is a big unveiling of the Monster on stage in front of a large audience to prove the creature is capable of carrying out orders, and they sing and dance as well. In the end though, the Monster is chased by a mob, and to save his experiment Frederick decides to sacrifice himself passing his soul into the other body, and vice versa, so imagine what happens when he marries Elizabeth. Also starring Richard Haydn as Herr Falkstein, Liam Dunn as Mr. Hilltop and Danny Goldman as Medical Student. Wilder makes a great mad scientist, Feldman has many fine one liners as the hunchback, Kahn gets her moments including as the ""bride"" with the big striped hair, and Hackman is good as the Blind Hermit. Filled with all the clichés from the great classic horrors to create the laughs, and a song and dance to go with it, it is a marvellous homage and a good fun horror spoof. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted From Other Material for Wilder and Brooks. It was number 89 on 100 Years, 100 Songs for ""Puttin' on the Ritz"", it was number 20 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and it was number 13 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!",Young Frankenstein
12,ccthemovieman-1,Possibly Mel Brooks' Best Film,10,11 March 2006,"Over 30 years later this film still provides a ton of laughs to audiences.It's always good to see the late Marty Feldman, whose face was hysterical and perfect for this film. In fact, he, along with the camera-work, really make this film one to watch and enjoy multiple times. Teri Garr was at her best and never looked as pretty as did in here. Add in the great talents of Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Gene Hackman, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, etc., and you have a memorable movie with a lot of memorable scenes.Looking at the Frankenstien ""monster"" in a tuxedo or sitting up in bed with a cigar reading The Wall Street Journal are just a few of the outlandish scenes, along Wilder entering the mansion commenting on the ""nice knockers.""Kudos, also, for Mel Brooks having the good sense to film this in black-and- white. It may have been his best film, although ""Blazing Saddles"" would give it a run for its money. My only complaint was Wilder's constant yelling, which becomes abrasive and can give you a headache after awhile! Still, this has to be considered one of the best ""comedy classics"" ever.",Young Frankenstein
13,rmax304823,Rude Desires,7,13 May 2006,"Mel Brooks is in touch with out deepest desires, no doubt about it. Fear, greed, lust, self aggrandizement, jealousy -- everything we enjoy denying that we have.This is illustrated in the opening scene, under the credits. A coffin is opened. There is a rotting skeleton holding a book. A pair of hands reaches in and tries to remove the book, but the skeletal digits seems to snatch it back. The human hands pull away, then tentatively reach again for the book, but this time they're trembling.None of Brooks' humor is elegant, revolving as it does around these primitive motives and human weaknesses such as farts. This isn't Woody Allan. Nobody is going to pull Marshall McLuhan out of a crowd and ask him to explain his theories. Nobody in Brooks' movie has ever HEARD of Marshall McLuhan.And yet when Brooks connects, he pops it out of the park. How can anyone watch the scene in which Peter Boyle's monster visits the blind Gene Hackman without laughing? The lonely Hackman, trying to please his guest, spills boiling hot soup into his lap -- twice. He smashes the monster's Bierstein and sets his thumb on fire. ""Where you going'?"" whines Hackman after the monster smashes out through the door. ""I was gonna make espresso."" If the jokes fail, as they do about three times out of four, it's still interesting to watch the actors. They seem to be having a lot of fun. Terri Garr looks like a luscious blond yummy from the Midwest. Maybe she has no glabella but she has a sly bosom that makes up for it. Madeleine Kahn has a small but funny part. She's a good singer too. Why do people die young? We saw this at a theater in the Tanforan Shopping Center in South San Francisco. You should see it too, especially if you are in some kind of Edgar Allan Poe-ish funk.",Young Frankenstein
14,ma-cortes,"This is one of Mel Brooks/Gene Wilder's best ; plenty of humor , entertainment and amusement",8,16 December 2013,"Dr. Frankenstein's (Gene Wilder has stated that this is his favorite of all the films he's made) grandson, after years of living down the family reputation, inherits granddad's castle and repeats the experiments carried out many years ago .

In the castle he finds a funny hunchback called Igor (Marty Feldman), a gorgeous lab assistant (Teri Garr) named Inga and the old housekeeper, Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman) . Later on , he successfully reanimates a body (Peter Boyle) which soon flees and creates wreak havoc . Hilarious Mel Brooks/Gene Wilder comedy filled with horror satire , amusing events , nice settings and lots of laughters . This spoof of the old Universal terror movies is fun from start to finish . The original cut of the movie was almost twice as long as the final cut, and it was considered by all involved to be an abysmal failure , it was only after a marathon cutting session that they produced the final cut of the film, which both Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks considered to be far superior to the original product ; at one point they noted that for every joke that worked, there were three that fell flat , so they went in and trimmed all the jokes that didn't work. Enjoyable support cast such as Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth , Cloris Leachman as Frau Blücher , Kenneth Mars as Inspector Kemp and brief acting by John Carradine , Leon Askin played a lawyer but was cut out , final film of Oscar Beregi Jr and of Richard Haydn , but most of his role was deleted from the final print . And uncredited Gene Hackman as the Blind Man, in fact parting line ""I was gonna make espresso"" was not in the script, but was ad-libbed by the same Gene Hackman during shooting . When Mel Brooks found that Ken Strickfaden, who had made the elaborate electrical machinery for the lab sequences in the Universal Frankenstein films, was still alive in the Los Angeles area. He visited Strickfaden and found that Strickfaden had saved all the equipment and had it stored in his garage. Brooks made a deal to rent the equipment for his film and gave Strickfaden the screen credit he'd deserved, but hadn't gotten, for the original films. Evocative as well as luxurious cinematography in white and black by magnificent director of photography Gerald Hirschfeld . Lively and agreeable musical score by John Morris , Mel Brooks's usual . Excellent makeup by artist Ed Butterworth, being helped by the classic William Tuttle as makeup creator , as just like in the original Frankenstein (1931), greenish face makeup was used on the monster to make his features more prominent . Perfect sets and impressive production design , in fact he electrical apparatus used in the movie was basically the same as the equipment used Frankenstein (1931) , including many of the same props and lab equipment . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Mel Brooks ((Blazing saddles , High anxiety , Twelve chairs , The producers , Spaceballs , History of the world). It was voted this movie as one of ""The 50 Greatest Comedies Of All Time"" in 2006 and at the 1975 Golden Globe Awards, Cloris Leachman was nominated for Best Lead Actress in a Comedy/Musical, while Madeline Kahn was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for their work in this movie.",Young Frankenstein
15,BA_Harrison,Mel Brooks fails to bring much life to his parody of Frankenstein.,4,3 October 2015,"Mel Brooks opens his 1974 parody of Universal's classic Frankenstein films with a suitably atmospheric scene in which the camera, having slowly closed in on the Frankenstein castle during the credits, glides across a rain-lashed courtyard and into a room where lies a coffin emblazoned with the name and crest of Baron Von Frankenstein. The coffin lid swings open to reveal a decomposed corpse clutching a box; at this point, Mel Brooks starts with his puerile comedy, a hand trying to snatch away the box, the corpse pulling it back. It's all downhill from here-on in, the dreadfully unsophisticated humour rarely hitting the mark.It's clear that Brooks has an affection for his subject matter, such is the attention to detail in the sets and the acute cinematography, but his gags simply do not do the concept justice, the material ranging from broad farce to puerile smut. To make matters worse, Brooks frequently has his performers break the fourth wall, giving knowing looks to the audience, which is plain embarrassing. While he was at it, he should have had some of his cast apologise to the viewers for their dreadful performances as well: Gene Wilder is particularly irritating, shouting his way through every scene, Marty Feldman simply mugs a lot and rolls his huge eyes, and Madeline Kahn is annoyingly shrill.The film's most credible turn comes from Peter Boyle, as the creature, who is far better than the dross he is given to work with. The movie's other saving grace is Teri Garr, as Frankenstein's sexy assistant Inga: her performance is Teri-ble, but at least she is Garr-geous to look at (believe me when I say that my awful puns are no less funny than any of Brooks' gags).",Young Frankenstein
16,moonspinner55,"Incredible cast and production design, erratic script",8,8 July 2001,"I would be hard-pressed to find another comedy with a cast this good. Everyone--Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr, Gene Hackman, Kenneth Mars--sparkles in their own realm of dementia here, especially Wilder, whose brand of mayhem uncorks at whim and sometimes sends us scurrying for cover! It's a very funny--and yet serious--spoof of the ""Frankenstein"" movies, with humor that derives from our nostalgia and the set replicas as much from the dialogue. The plot is (intentionally) familiar, but the script isn't always so predictable, throwing the audience a curve-ball now and then. The jokes range from terrific to terrible, yet the cast and director/co-writer Mel Brooks almost always manage to keep the movie on track. Wilder teamed with Brooks on the screenplay, and there was a small feud about who did most of the work; consequently, they never did another picture together. It was their loss as well as ours, for despite some OK films (Wilder's ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother"" and Brooks' ""High Anxiety""), neither reached the heights they climbed with ""Young Frankenstein"". *** out of ****",Young Frankenstein
17,paul_haakonsen,Wholesome fun...,6,31 December 2015,"This comedy spoof is actually a rather enjoyable movie, and it is the type of movie that can be seen multiple time and still manage to be good and entertaining. ""Young Frankenstein"" is exactly what you would expect from a Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder collaboration.The story told in ""Young Frankenstein"" is about a descendant of the notorious Victor Frankenstein who is also a man of science. He travels to his forefathers old castle and stumbles on the written work of his forefather, which leads him to the secrets of reanimating dead flesh.Don't get deterred by the movie being filmed in black and white, because it actually did help the movie in the right way. The black and white is a great contrast and amplifies the atmosphere of the movie.And the cast in the movie was really good. Gene Wilder was good as Dr. Frankenstein and Peter Boyle was awesome as the monster. Cloris Leachman also brought her usual charms to the movie. But best of all was Marty Feldman as Igor. And there was also a nice appearance by Gene Hackman.All in all, ""Young Frankenstein"" is a fun movie and equally entertaining.",Young Frankenstein
18,blanche-2,Hilarious send-up of the Frankenstein story,8,21 October 2007,"Gene Wilder is the scientist Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkenshteen) who returns to the family castle in ""Young Frankenstein,"" a classic, 1974 Mel Brooks comedy that is now enjoying a reincarnation as a Broadway musical. Besides Wilder, it stars Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, Teri Garr, Peter Boyle and Cloris Leachman, all of whom are hilarious. Kahn is the wealthy fiancée of Dr. F, who sees him off at the train station as he leaves to collect his inheritance of the Frankenstein castle and his grandfather's papers. There he meets Igor (pronounced EYE-gor) (Feldman), who has a hump that moves from side to side - not that he admits to having one (""what hump?""), the housekeeper Frau Blucher - every time her name is mentioned, horses can be heard neighing in the distance, and a busty lab assistant named Inga (Garr). As if genetically encrypted, he repeats grandpa's experiments and creates a monster (Peter Boyle). What follows is a take-off on the ""Frankenstein"" films as the monster escapes and meets a little girl and a blind man (the uncredited Gene Hackman in a ""Bride of Frankenstein"" moment), the scenes all the funnier if you've seen the originals. Frankenstein is recaptured, and in order to prove his genius, Dr. F introduces him to a crowd of scientists, and man and his creation perform ""Puttin' on the Ritz,"" the highlight of the film.The movie is complete insanity, which is its intent, with great characterizations, funny bits and humor ranging from side-splitting to silly to sexual. The performances are fantastic: Wilder plays it straight and dramatic, making his Dr. F even funnier than if he'd camped it up; Feldman also takes his part seriously and gives some deadpan line deliveries; Garr sports a German accent and is very funny as Inga; Leachman's Frau Blucher, who breaks down and admits the earlier Dr. F ""vas my BOYFWEND"" gives a truly classic performance in one of the best roles in the film. Peter Boyle's Frankenstein, when he finally speaks, has shades of Marlon Brando - Boyle is positively brilliant, first as a horny giant, then as a singer/dancer, and finally as a misunderstood misfit.The best performance, in my opinion, comes from Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth. It's a bravura performance with her every moment a comic gem, giving the role the magic touch that only she could. Feldman, Boyle, and Kahn are gone now, far too soon, but they all left wonderful comic legacies. Elizabeth is probably Kahn's best film performance. Who can ever hear ""Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life!"" in the same way again.",Young Frankenstein
19,Quinoa1984,"A funny comedy, one of Brooks' best",10,2 May 2000,"Mel Brooks makes one of the best parody films ever with this comedy about the gradnson of Dr. Frankenstein (Gene Wilder is terrific) who inherits his grandfather's mansion.  He like his old man is also a doctor, and sees he has a new assistant, Igor (pronounced as eye-gor in perfection by Marty Feldman).

Hilarious escapades in this goofy yet quotabe comedy parodying all the frankenstein movies and even creates some Brooksfilm cliche's.  Very funny every time I watch it.

20,Coventry,Mel Brooks ' comedy triumph !!,8,5 January 2004,"Creating a funny and light-headed comedy is one thing...but producing an effective parody might as well be the hardest thing to achieve in cinema. Because you need to have the talent to tell an already famous story in a tolerable and comic way. And, above all, you should always show respect for the original movie or classic story it is based on. And that's why most movies in this subgenre of cinema are a failure and the early movies of Mel Brooks are a triumph...Young Frankenstein is a series of brilliant scenes and hilarious highlights but the basic plot of Frankenstein is never mocked!! Thanks to Brooks ' writing talent and the terrific acting performances of the entire cast, Young Frankenstein is a magnificent cinema experience to observe. Brooks even manages to keep the horrific atmosphere in his movie and that's an achievement to itself. As mentioned before, the cast of Young Frankenstein couldn't be better. Gene Wilder is delicious as the baron but the show is obviously stolen by Marty Feldman as Igor...His facial expressions and small inside jokes are the absolute highlights. Acting legend Gene Hackman plays the role of the blind man. The classic sequence in which he invites the monster to his house stands as one of the funniest ones in modern cinema...in my humble opinion, at least. When talking about nowadays crappy movies in the genre (like the Scary Movies for example), I think it's safe to say that the genre of decent ""spoofs"" is dead and buried. Young and untalented directors turned it into a vulgar and uninspired genre. If you're looking for the titles that are worth the effort, you can't go wrong with the earlier work of Mel Brooks. Young Frankenstein of course, but also Blazing Saddles, High Anxiety and Silent Movie...",Young Frankenstein
21,studioAT,OK. Not fantastic though,2,2 December 2016,"'Young Frankenstein' - a film sadly brought back into the public's mind this year due to the sad death of Gene Wilder.It feels wrong to review this film. It belongs to another era, it's comedy was so different to ours now. In some ways that's a good thing, it's certainly more sharper than what we produce today, but there are moments that are dated and unfunny.It's a cult classic though, and you can see why. There are some iconic moments in amongst the run time, and that's why people watch it again and again.As a casual viewer though I couldn't quite buy into the madness in the same way I could with Wilder and Brooks' other project 'The Producers'.",Young Frankenstein
22,hitchcockthelegend,"For what we are about to see next, we must enter quietly into the realm of genius.",8,2 May 2012,"Young Frankenstein is directed by Mel Brooks who also co-writes the screenplay with Gene Wilder. It stars Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Teri Garr and Madeline Kahn. Music is by John Morris and cinematography by Gerald Hirschfeld.Filmed in black and white, Brook's movie is an affectionate spoof of the Frankenstein movies that came out of Universal Studios back in the 1930s.There wolf, there castle.You are either a Mel Brooks fan or not, there doesn't seem to be any middle ground. However, even his most ardent fans admit not all of his productions have paid dividends, but when on song, as he was in 1974 (Blazing Saddles also released), it's justifiable that those fans proclaim him as a spoof maestro. Ineviatbly a bit tame when viewed today, Young Frankenstein is still a picture of high comedy and clinical execution of the film making craft. Everything works, from acting performances, the gags that are both visual and aural delights, to the set design of the Frankenstein castle. It also boasts a smooth storyline, this is not a hodge-podge of ideas lifted from those Universal monster classics, it has a spin on the story and inserts its own memorable scenes along the way (Puttin' on the Ritzzzzzzzz, Oh my!).Of its time for sure, but still great entertainment for the Mel Brooks fan. 8/10",Young Frankenstein
23,Theo Robertson,Not The Greatest Comedy But Still Amusing,7,15 January 2006,"When I first saw YOUNG FRAKENSTIEN 20 years ago I rolled around the living room in fits of hysterical laughter , something that hasn't happened very often . In fact I would probably that throughout my life this has just got to be the funniest film I have ever seen in my life so when it was broadcast on BBC 2 over the Christmas period I went out of my way to watch it Hmmm . I have to amend my opinion chaps . Not only is it no longer the funniest film I have seen in my entire life I wouldn't even consider it the funniest film from Mel Brooks ( Which will remain now and forever BLAZING SADDLES ) which is a great shame . The problem is that much of the early part of the story seems to drag along with a fairly unfunny broad performance by Gene Wilder and he's not helped by Marty Feldman as Igor , though perhaps the screenplay is to blame since both characters have a running gag of getting their names wrong - "" Fronkonsteen "" and "" Eyegore "" . Some of the other failings might be down to the fact that my views of the original Universal horror movies that YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN parody have changed over the years . When I was a teenager I used to love these movies had very fond memories but after seeing them all again over the years I found them lacking and were nowhere as good as I remembered them That said where this film is at its funniest is when they directly spoof scenes from the original movie . The scenes with Inspector Kemp , especially when he is first introduced still make laugh as does the scenes culled from THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTIEN featuring Gene Hackman . It's just a pity the laughs are a long time coming and somewhat inconsistent and it's one of those movies that will have the audience remembering all the good bits while forgetting the more numerous unfunny bits",Young Frankenstein
24,Hey_Sweden,Great fun for comedy *and* horror fans.,10,15 November 2011,"Leading actor Gene Wilder and director Mel Brooks do a great job of spoofing the classic black & white ""Frankenstein"" movies, ""Son of Frankenstein"" in particular. Wilder is Dr. ""Fronkensteen"" (he's trying to distance himself from his grandfathers' legacy, hence the alternate pronunciation) who returns to the old family castle in Transylvania, not taking a very long time to develop an intense interest in Victors' plans to reanimate dead tissue. Both helped and hindered by ultra sexy assistant Inga (Teri Garr) and hunchbacked associate Igor, pronounced ""Eye-gor"" (the hilarious Marty Feldman), he gets to create his own Monster, played by Peter Boyle.With equally amusing work by Madeline Kahn as uptight Elizabeth, Cloris Leachman as conniving Frau Blucher (cue the horse whinny), and Kenneth Mars as sometimes unintelligible Inspector Kemp, who does some superb shtick with his artificial arm, the cast plays their roles to the hilt. Wilder goes delightfully over the top at times, always coming up with just the right delivery of his lines, Boyle is very endearing as The Monster, and Feldman does some priceless mugging.Many memorable set pieces, including the show-stopping ""Putting on the Ritz"" musical number, and much in the way of quotable dialogue. The spoof of the interlude with the blind man from ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is also fantastic, with an unrecognizable Gene Hackman playing the blind man, as is the sequence with the revolving wall. Hearing Kahn voice her sexual pleasure in song is a hoot, especially considering her choice of song. Utilizing the talents of people like composer John Morris, cinematographer Gerald Hirschfeld, and production designer Dale Hennesy, Brooks impressively recreates the look of those old movies, and for good measure also utilizes the original laboratory equipment designed by Kenneth Strickfaden.""Young Frankenstein"" has to remain one of the high points of Brooks's career (along with ""Blazing Saddles"", he had a real banner year in 1974), and although he returned to poking fun of classic horror with ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"", it just wasn't as effective. 37 years later, ""Young Frankenstein"" is still genuinely funny and atmospheric, and enjoyable upon each viewing.10 out of 10.",Young Frankenstein
25,Doylenf,"""Put the candle back!!""...Side-splittingly funny spoof of the original...",8,29 August 2006,"Mel Brooks wisely decided to film YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN in B&W to better duplicate all the richly detailed castle exteriors and interiors of FRANKENSTEIN ('31). His homage to the James Whales original goes much further than that. There isn't a gag in the newer flick that doesn't remind you of just such a moment from a dozen other horror films. But that's what makes it so side-splittingly funny, as one silly gag follows another! From the opening scene in a medical class where GENE WILDER insists on the correct pronunciation of his name, to the railroad scene where he is saying good-bye to his sweetheart (MADELINE KAHN), the sharp humor never lets up. Their elbow nudging good-bye (she doesn't want to get her hair mussed) is priceless comic gold.And that's just for starters. Once it gets to the castle, we meet CLORIS LEACHMAN as Frau Blucher (she's so hilarious, I can't understand how anyone kept a straight face) and eventually PETER BOYLE (playful as the monster), we know this is a comedy classic the likes of which we'll probably never see again--at least from Mel Brooks.Wonderfully entertaining, there's not a single dull moment--especially when we have scenes like Wilder and his assistant, curvy TERI GARR doing their candlestick routine by the secret bookcase panel.All the cobwebs, thunder and lightning and special effects are perfect for this kind of fun/scary treatment--and to top it off, we have a show biz routine with Wilder and The Monster doing ""Puttin' on the Ritz"". What more could you ask for?",Young Frankenstein
26,preppy-3,Easily Mel Brooks best film,8,21 February 2012,"The grandson of Dr. Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has been trying to ignore his grandfather's reputation. However he gets the grandfather's castle in Transylvania, finds the book on how he made a monster and decides to try his own hand at it.Now classic takeoff on the Universal Frankenstein movies. Mel Brooks obviously loved the old Frankenstein movies (unlike westerns that he crudely spoofed in ""Blazing Saddles"") and he cuts down on his crude jokes and makes this quite amusing. As an added plus it was shot in black and white which just helped the movie immensely. Also the cast is great--Wilder chews the scenery as Dr. Frankenstein; Peter Boyle is funny (and scary) as the monster; Marty Feldman is just hysterical as Igor (his looks to the camera alone are great!); Chloris Leachman is underused by still fun as Frau Bluchar; the same with Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth; Teri Garr takes the impossible sexpot role and makes it work.The script is quick and funny, the cinematography is beautiful and there's a wonderful score. Also there's a totally hysterical sequence between Boyle and Gene Hackman (as a blind man). It only gets an 8 because it DOES have its slow spots, not all the jokes work (I never found the ""Putting on the Ritz"" number funny--just surreal) and it falls apart at the end. Still this is well worth catching.",Young Frankenstein
27,LeonLouisRicci,More Here to Admire than Not,8,6 August 2013,"It helps immensely to not only be familiar with the Universal Frankenstein Series, but to know them implicitly. Because much of the best humor here is derived from direct parody of certain famous scenes.This is typical Mel Brooks with its broad and lewd fixation on Sex and Human Sexuality, but these don't work the best in this Film. But, it is consistently funny with some clever slapstick and wordplay. Some of it is quite refreshingly inventive (""Abbey Normal"") and Cloris Leachman's deadpan mugging.The Hunchback (what hunch?) Igor (pronounced eye-gore) also is a field day for Marty Feldman. Add to this the spot on mimicry of the one armed Captain from the Son of' Movie, and the inspired Peter Boyle's Creature, it all sums up for a great looking love-fest from Brooks and company. The one drawback is the relentless screaming of lines, when they would have been even more effective delivered a bit more restrained. But when Gene Wilder isn't shouting he is rather amusing wavering between straight faced Satire and unhinged psychopathy.",Young Frankenstein
28,poolandrews,Seems overrated to me.,5,1 January 2009,"Young Frankenstein starts as Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) a brilliant neurosurgeon & grandson of the infamous Baron Victor Frankenstein learns that he has inherited the ancestral family castle in Transylvania. Arriving there the quickly finds his grandfather's private library & notes which describe how he created & re-animated a dead body, inspired by this Frederick decides to carry on his grandfather's work & perfect it in the hope that he will be able to create a new life...Co-written & directed by Mel Brooks I came on the IMDb to comment on Young Frankenstein & I am greeted by various comments & user ratings that seem to suggest that this is just about the greatest & funniest spoof homage ever, having watched Young Frankenstein from start to finish mere hours ago I wondered if I had seen the same film as the users here who rave about it like it's the best thing since sliced bread because I have to say I thought it was average at best. Personally I think Young Frankenstein works better as a straight beautifully crafted homage to Universial Frankenstein films rather than a spoof comedy. For me the comedy more often than not misses the mark & even on the few occasions when it doesn't I didn't find it anything more than mildly amusing. The minor gags like when Frankenstein accidentally stabs himself in the leg, the scenes when the horses keep make a noise when a certain character's name is mentioned & a scene when Frankenstein has to pretend a dead bodies arm is his own when confronted by a policeman work quite well but when the film descends into total farce like the dumb inspector with a wooden arm, Frankenstein & the monster tap dancing on stage together & a silly bit when while being throttled by the monster Frankenstein has to play charades with his assistant's to get them to help him just feel out of place & to my eyes weren't in the least bit funny. Apparently the original cut of the film was twice as long as the released one & when viewed was considered terrible so all the unfunny jokes were cut (not all of them in my opinion) & that is the version that was released & became so popular.Young Frankenstein follows the Universal Frankenstein films quite closely & many scenes are lovingly recreated like the re-animation part, the girl by the lake scene & the part when the monster meets a blind-man. The one area where the two do differ is in the ending which here is very silly & again I just didn't find funny at all. The film looks wonderful, shot in black and white with beautiful atmospheric production design which gives the film a sumptuous look. The film actually uses many of the original laboratory props & equipment from the original Universal Frankenstein (1931) which someone had kept in their garage.With a supposed budget of about $2,800,000 the production values are great & the film looks great throughout of that there is no doubt & in a way the constantly unfunny jokes & gags got in the way for me & I thought Young Frankenstein worked best when it was a straight homage to the Universal Frankenstein films. The acting is alright, Gene Wilder apparently rates this as his favourite film that he has been in while Gene Hackman originally went uncredited as the blind-man.Young Frankenstein is not the best comedy ever, it's not the best spoof ever & it's not even Mel Brook's best film, I'm sorry but I just didn't find it very funny & apart from the tremendous production design & one or two mildly amusing gags I can't see why it's so highly rated. A musical version was adapted & premiered on stage in New York during 2007.",Young Frankenstein
29,CinemaSerf,Superbly creative Mel Brooks...,7,17 August 2020,"I'd probably best start by saying that I love the writing of Mel Brooks, but I detest the acting style of Gene Wilder - so my views on this are somewhat mixed. It is a spoof - and James Whale ought to be writ large in the credits, as should Glenn Miller and a host of others who have inadvertently contributed to the wonderfully paced script, that rarely draws breath whilst Wilder - the grandson of the famous mad scientist - decides to visit Transylvania where he stumbles upon a formula that might just bring the dead back to life. In my view, the acting plaudits go to Marty Feldman, who is great as henchman ""Igor"" trying desperately to foil the over-the-top antics of the star - who just seems to play each role he takes on in the same, super-hammy, fashion with big eyes and loud, grand gestures that I find most unfunny. Coupled with Brooks, they are, however, on cracking writing form and as parodies go this sets up the whole genre - sometimes overtly and sometimes subtly, but regardless - when you listen to the dialogue you can't help but laugh. For me, it could have done with a less annoying star - but the writing has stood the test of time well and is still very much worth a watch.",Young Frankenstein

Most of the jokes in the movie are extremely lame and often predictable but you're still laughing your butt off because of them. This is thanks to the comical genius that Mel Brooks is. With this movie he shows once more that he was quite probably the best comedy director of the 20th century.The atmosphere of the movie is totally fantastic because it was shot entirely in black & white. At times you really think you're watching the 1931 Frankenstein movie. This movie is an hilarious and brilliant spoof of that old classic horror movie.Billy Wilder is extremely good in this movie but person that blew me away was Madeline Kahn. What a talented comical actress she was! Kenneth Mars and Gene Hackman also show up, in extremely hilarious roles.The story works extremely well for the movie and it flows very well.

33,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Was I supposed to love this?,7,31 January 2010,"I haven't watched the 1931 original that this is a spoof of, and I'm not a fan of Wilder(in fact, I dislike his style; with that said, parts of his performance in this did work for me, though I didn't care that much for how over the top he was at points). Maybe that's why I can't quite chime in with the mass of people calling this one of the best of its kind. I just find it to be pretty hit and miss, and frankly, minutes passed several times without me enjoying any of the jokes(and I honestly did not bring a negative attitude to my viewing, intending to dislike it, nor am I disappointed from having come into it with too high expectations), including the very beginning. This pokes fun at horror movies and the typical film clichés, and there is silliness, black comedy, crude material, a little verbal and slapstick, as well. A lot of scenes from the story are incorporated, most to good effect, and Brooks definitely gets plenty of laughs out of the instantly recognizable grunting of the Monster. The cast do well, and this does a fair job of not overusing any of them. Boyle and Hackman are hilarious, probably my favorites of this, and you don't get tired of either of them. At the end of the day, I prefer Spaceballs and Men in Tights to this. There are many mild references to sexuality, and a little minor language in this. I recommend this to fans of those who made it. 7/10",Young Frankenstein

I thought that I had seen ""Young Frankenstein,"" but in re-watching it I realized that I'd only seen part of it. I also realized that it just isn't that funny, certainly not as funny as I wanted it to be.It's got funny moments, most of them supplied by Marty Feldman as Igor. But most of the humor feels fairly strained and a lot of it hasn't aged well, having a wocka-wocka old-fashioned vaudeville quality to it that's supposed to make us groan in a good way, like dad jokes. I was mostly struck by how slowly paced the film is. Jokes are oddly timed, with long pauses as if set to a laugh track that we can't here. The result is lots of dead air, with awkward moments waiting for someone to keep talking, as if the actors in the movie forgot their lines.To be fair, I think much of this is due to Mel Brooks' style just not being my cup of tea, as obviously millions of other people adore this movie and some of his others. I myself love ""The Producers,"" which I think is probably the best Brooks film. I just think this one is overrated.""Young Frankenstein"" brought Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was also nominated for Best Sound in the same year that saw another Mel Brooks comedy, ""Blazing Saddles,"" land three nominations of its own.

35,AlsExGal,What a great satire,10,10 October 2016,"Mel Brooks has yet to find a movie genre he hasn't enjoyed satirizing, and this parody of Gothic horror is no exception. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder)excuse me..FRONK-EN-STEEN, is a neurosurgeon who is also teaching at a medical school.Frederick has spent his entire life distancing himself from his infamous grandfather. He inherits his demented grandfather's castle in Transylvania and becomes curious about his experiments to the point that he is enticed into repeating them.Lending great support is Marty Feldman as Frankenstein's incompetent hump backed assistant Igor (pronounced EGOR), Madeleine Kahn as Frankenstein's seemingly frigid fiancée who comes visiting at the castle at an awkward time, Terri Garr as Frankenstein's buxom assistant, and Peter Boyle as the monster. Cloris Leachman almost steals the show as Frau Blucher, Victor Frankenstein's girlfriend who dreams of her dead beloved's experiments coming to fruition and whose name seems to scare horses. It is full of sight gags, slapstick, one liners, and an outrageous spoof of ""Puttin on the Ritz"" that should have brought an irate Irving Berlin, author of the song, rising from his grave were this an actual horror film. The only problem is, Berlin was still alive when this film was made. I really can't tell you anymore or I'd ruin it for you.Gene Wilder co-wrote this one with Mel Brooks, and I just can't see anybody but Wilder with his manic style of comedy that matches his wild hair starring in this one. Filmed in black and white to imitate the style of the 30's Frankenstein movies - and it borrows from all of the first three - Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein, I do make one suggestion. It borrows so heavily from 1939's Son of Frankenstein that I suggest that if you have not seen that film, that you watch it before this one. Otherwise you will find yourself breaking out into laughter in ""Son of Frankenstein"" where laughter was never intended.

This is an impressive translation by Mel Brooks who scored with Blazing Saddles the same year. He wisely opted for black and white filming to add to the classic film effect. Gene Wilder delivers one of his greatest performances as Frederick Frankenstein, a skilled professor who accepts his grandfather's will and travels to Transylvania much to his fiancé's disappointment. Peter Boyle plays the monster whom he brings to life only to discover that Igor had submitted the wrong brain. Dr. Frankenstein will attempt to civilize him, which leads to hilarious situations and encounters including a song and dance number. What really comes across is the willingness to sacrifice, which also has a funny payoff. Marty Feldman is hilarious even when he isn't the focus. He plays Igor who makes the mistake of grabbing the wrong brain at the lab. Teri Garr is a hoot as assistant Inga whose bubble-headed disposition brings many great lines. The invaluable Madeline Kahn is ravishing as the uptight fiancé to Dr. Frankenstein who has a hilarious monstrous encounter.

This is also a very funny spoof on Frankenstein movies as Mel Brooks was top notch in this film as he did nearly no wrong in casting and the story was to die for. The only complaint I have is not really all that big, but I just find this movie is most funny during the beginning and middle while the ending, while not weak, is not as strong. Gene Wilder plays the son of the notorious Dr. Frankenstein great, at times playing his role in a straight and serious manner, then he goes off on a demented rant the next. Other characters and cast are good as well, but for my money Marty Feldman stole the show as Igor (prounced eye-gor here of course). From his scene in the basement posing as one of the heads on display to his bad choice in brains, he was the highlight in this movie for me along with the brief, but also very memorable performance of Gene Hackman as a blind man who asks god for just someone to stop by and visit him. The story is very basic Frankenstein with the strange Mel Brooks flair added in for fun.

He travels to Transylvania after inheriting his grandfather's creepy castle and re-starts his mad experiments with the help of a hunchback (Marty Feldman), a hot lab assistant (Teri Garr) and a housekeeper (Cloris Leachman). Peter Boyle plays the Monster, Kenneth Mars the inspector and Madeline Kahn Frankenstein's fiancé.While there are a few laugh-out-loud sequences (the best being the one with the seesaw), the movie's mostly quietly amusing. Similar horror parodies had been done before, like Roman Polanski's ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" (1967) and ""The Vampire Happening"" (1971), but ""Young Frankenstein"" is just all-around better, mainly because of the outstanding cast.

40,SimonJack,Still somewhat funny these decades later,6,29 August 2019,"""Young Frankenstein"" retains some of the humor of the blockbuster comedy when it was released in 1974. But, compared to some of the best ""old"" comedies of the 20th century, it hasn't aged as well. The best of those comedies had scripts that were loaded with witty lines and funny antics. It was comedy that didn't lose it's humor by being dated. It evokes as many laughs decades later - in some instances, even more than on original release.Where this and many other comedies fail the test of time is in screenplays that are just peppered with humor here and there. While still funny in places, the rest of the story becomes flat.I have a sneaking suspicion that Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder, who co-wrote the screenplay, were emulating one off the characters that Peter Sellers played in the 1964 smash hit satire, ""Dr. Strangelove."" Inspector Kemp in this film, has some similar traits that Dr. Strangelove had in that earlier film. Kenneth Mars does well in the Kemp role.And, this still is a good film today, especially for adults and older teens who will recognize the innuendo. Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman and others do a very good job with their material. But, Marty Feldman is at least 50 percent of the film. Take him out, and most of the humor goes with him.

The other half is the glorious cast; not just foxy Teri Garr, but also Marty Feldman and Peter Boyle, who school us all on comic acting with little more than funny facial expressions and spartan dialogue.

Gene Wilder, of course, works very hard and has some marvellous moments, particularly in close-up. Some of the broader humour seems less funny to me now than it did originally but there is no denying the splendour of Peter Boyle as 'the creature' or the zoning performance from Madeline kahn, who really seems to make her role out of almost nothing. Biggest problem for me this time around was lack of continuity to the point that some parts of the film appeared little more than a series of sketches. For some reason i was particularly bothered by Wilder's sudden transition from wanting nothing to do with his grandfather to being all enthusiastic. The extras on the Blu-ray disc reveal all. The film was clearly cut down, presumably because considered over long and almost arbitrarily scenes were chopped. I assume it was decided to keep 'the funny bits' in and leave out the exposition, like the crucial reading of the will and its conditions. Personally I would have reduced the police inspector role, which can become somewhat tiresome.

45,Smells_Like_Cheese,"""Hearts and kidney's are tinker toys!""",10,24 November 2002,"I'm not kidding, this is one of the best comedies of all time! The 70's was one of the best decades of movies and Mel Brooks kicked butt in the comedy era. ""Young Frankenstein"" was obviously a parody on ""Mary Shelly's Frankenstein"" and I heard that Gene Wilder had wrote a script and just imagined being the grandson of Frankenstein. He and Mel Brooks together created a masterpiece of non stop laughs and a fun movie.""Young Frankenstein"" is great because it's an intelligent comedy that could make any adult or child laugh. I've been watching this movie since I was 5 years old and it still gets me today. My favorite scenes are ""Puttin' on the Ritz"", ""Now could you tell me who's brain I did put in?"", the monster and Elizabeth getting it on, and actually just the whole movie in general. The cast is just perfect, you can tell they had a blast making this movie. I think that's why people can enjoy it, because if the actors enjoyed it, so will the audience. Please, watch ""Young Frankenstein"", it's a great movie that will always bring a smile to your face.10/10",Young Frankenstein
46,MovieAddict2016,One of the funniest films ever made!,10,30 December 2003,"""The scariest comedy of all time!"" boasted the poster taglines for ""Young Frankenstein."" When a tagline pokes fun at itself, you know you're in for a real treat. Such is the case with Mel Brooks' ""Young Frankenstein,"" one of the greatest of all comedies and one of the only modern day films able to convince me from the start that I really was watching an old 30s film, and not a film made in 1974.Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder are both fans of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein,"" and so when they collaborated to write the screenplay for ""Young Frankenstein,"" I can only assume that it was a fun experience for both of them. They reworked the story of Frankenstein and his monster into a smart, occasionally hilarious, always enjoyable, classic comedy that helped put Brooks on the map after ""The Producers"" (""Blazing Saddles"" also helped quite a bit).Some fans of ""Frankenstein"" could consider the film almost sacrilegious, I suppose, but that wouldn't be fair. It's not a poke at any flaws in ""Frankenstein"" -- it's a well-thought-out continuation of Baron von Frankenstein's legacy, with an added pinch of slapstick comedy thrown in for good measure.Gene Wilder is Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (""Frahnk-un-steen,"" not ""Frank-en-steyn""), grandson of the crazy old loon Baron von Frankenstein, who attempted to re-animate dead matter in his creepy mansion in Transylvania years ago. Frederick is a successful neurosurgeon, eager to put his past behind him. When a student asks him questions about his grandfather and research into re-animation, he is quick to change the subject.Then he inherits his grandfather's castle in Transylvania and makes the long, weary journey there to acquire ownership. Greeted by Igor (pronounced ""Eegor,"" not ""Eyegor""), Frederick Frankenstein is soon haunted by his grandfather's interests. I guess the craving for re-animating dead tissue is just something that runs in one's blood!He stumbles upon an old chamber underneath the crumbling mansion, home to an assortment of odd inventions and textbooks (including ""How I Did It,"" by Baron von Frankenstein, which is a bit of an in-joke for readers of Mary Shelley's story -- they'll understand the joke, perhaps, more than most audiences).After finding a dead body in a graveyard and accidentally inserting an ""Abby Normal"" brain into it from the help of Igor (Marty Feldman), Frederick Frankenstein creates a new Monster (Peter Boyle), who is taken into custody by the townspeople and then escapes, finding an old blind man (Gene Hackman) in a cabin somewhere. He then kidnaps Frederick's bride to take her as his own and Frederick realizes that he must put an end to the Monster before everything in his life falls apart.There isn't much to say about a film like this. The comedy works, the style works, everything about it works. It's classic. Everything in it is classic Mel Brooks comedy.I suppose the accounts of Brooks' and Wilder's off-screen fights during filming are pretty well known. In one instance, Brooks got so mad at Wilder that he threw an object at him. Later he called Wilder and said, ""Who was that jerk that threw that thing at you today? He should be fired!""
It was because the two minds clashed together. Both being extreme fans of ""Frankenstein,"" I suppose both men had their own unique opinions as to what, exactly, the film should be about, and what, exactly, should happen in it. But for whatever the reason, despite all their arguments the film has turned into a masterpiece.Wilder's performance is extraordinary. After turning Leo Bloom (""The Producers"") into a nervous, paranoid, timid man, Wilder does a 180 here and makes Frankenstein into a self-assured, mean, forthright character -- giving us the feeling that he's been hassled his entire lifetime by nosy reporters researching into his grandfather's case, and he's tired of it.Filmed on-location in the original ""Frankenstein"" set, the film partly works because of its respect for the old horror films. The famous Universal horrors from the 1930s and 40s are spoofed in this film, and that is primarily is what truly makes it stand out from the other films in the genre. But Brooks and Wilder don't insult them. They compliment them and poke fun with them -- not at them.Brooks tried this formula once again in 1995 with ""Dracula: Dead and Loving it!"", which starred Leslie Nielsen as Count Dracula, although the outcome was not as smart as ""Young Frankenstein"" and not as convincing. Brooks did a great thing by filming ""Young Frankenstein"" in grainy 30-style black and white, reminiscent of old films such as ""Dracula"" or ""The Wolf Man"" or ""Frankenstein"" itself (not coincidentally, Brooks makes more than a few references to other Universal horror films, too). Part of the greatness of this film is the manner in which it is filmed. I can't imagine ""Young Frankenstein"" in color. But then again, I can't really imagine ""Spaceballs"" in black and white...5/5 stars.John Ulmer",Young Frankenstein
47,DKosty123,Hilarious- Mel Brooks @ The Top,8,18 September 2006,"This film is one of the great comedy take-offs from the classic monster franchise created by Mary Shelley's work. While Frankenstein has been spoofed more often than most, notably by the team of Abbott & Costello, this take on the them is the best. I am not sure how it could be done any better. Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, & Cloris Leachman are all great. Peter Boyle is well cast too.The difference between this and previous spoofs is that it follows through a parody of the original tail & mines it for almost every possible joke you can imagine. The mine seems loaded with golden ore too. With everything from Igor's moving hump, too Abby Normal, too Frau Bucher, & finally to topping it off with a classic endowment, this film is pure gold from start to finish. They managed to use the original lab equipment Universal used in Frankenstein which really gives it a classic look. It is so good, nobody ever complains about it being in black & white which gives it more of a visual feel dedicated to the original classic. Repeated viewings seem to be like working a stream with the pan, & finding more & more nuggets.",Young Frankenstein
48,lasttimeisaw,Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder's best!,8,7 November 2014,"My third Mel Brooks' comedy, after HISTORY OF THE WORLD: PART I (1981, 6/10) and HIGH ANXIETY (1977, 6/10), and I daresay it is his best! It is a monochrome homage to Frankenstein's monster franchise and magnificently crafted as a whole new parody with a sterling cast. Unfortunately I haven't watched any of Universal's classical horror series, so it is nonviable for me to discern how the homage aspect proceeds, nevertheless, it doesn't hamper my appreciation of this film. Wilder is Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (the self-claimed pronunciation is Fronkensien), a medical professor in America, whose grandfather is the notorious mad scientist Victor Frankenstein, is lured back to inherit his family estate in Transylvania, but as a scientist himself, Frederick is strongly repellent towards his grandfather's doings. After meeting his bulging-eyed hunchback servant Igor (pronounced ""eyegore"" here), who is played by a pronounced Feldman, the desirable personal assistant Inga (Garr with a ludicrous German accent) and the frosty housekeeper Frau Blücher (the haughty and drolly Leachman), he finds out the private journals left by Victor about the reanimation of dead tissues, cannot resist the temptation, he carries out a plan to reanimate his creature (Boyle), only later he is aware that the brain he uses in the transplantation is an abnormal one. Then, the storyline flickeringly stretches over the creature's encounters with a little girl and a blind hermit (a genuinely side-splitting episode with an uncredited Hackman) after his escape, then Wilder and Brooks' script takes a drastic turn to introduce Frederick and the creature's live-performance of Irving Berlin's musical number ""Puttin' On The Ritz"", which ends badly and the creature is captured, but it is pure fun. Frederick's fiancée Elizabeth (Kahn) arrives uninvited, and her consistent refusal any physical intimacy with Frederick in the name of keeping her chastity before wedding night, is comically disintegrated by sheer phallic-ism in front of the creature. And she bells out a riotous ""Sweet mystery of Life"" during the intercourse, with some splendid vocal inflections. Brooks opts for a merry finale for both Frederick and his creature, they both exchange some part of their advantages to each other and eventually, they can go out for a pleasant double date.Gene Wilder is priceless, superbly casts his deadpan humor with visceral gags, sometimes he is even affective. The sparkling chemistry between him and the scene-stealing Feldman using wisecracks and slap-sticks can effectively crack viewers up (from the ""walk this way"" spoof and on). Boyle's monster, although the make-up team is substandard, you can literally see the paddings and fake stitches in his head, is never ferocious or deliberately harmful, he is a slow-witted newborn has the primal fear of fire and fond of the euphony of violin, the caricature never transcends into scare-fest. Kahn and Leachman are two staunch comediennes, each clings to the stereotyped characterizations and builds on their own zest and zingers, so is Garr, but in a less vivid role as the bimbo and Kenneth Mars' Inspector Kemp, who is extensively lampooned for one stiff limb and inarticulate elocution. The cinematography and production design are sublime thanks to its retro polishing, the film holds extremely well for a first viewing 40 years later, it is a favorable comedy can be thoroughly enjoyed without any abashment in hindsight which prevalently resides in most of our present-day low-taste offerings, just go and watch ""the scariest comedy of all time!""",Young Frankenstein
49,Rainey-Dawn,Puttin' On The Comedy,8,29 June 2014,"Funny, funny, funny flick. If this comedy-horror does not get you laughing then you are already dead. It's a good film with a heavy salting of dry, odd-ball humor and lightly peppered of slap-stick. If you do not know the story of, or have never seen a Frankenstein film before then you should watch one in-order to get the humor in this movie.This is an all-star fantastic cast with a cute script.

51,OllieSuave-007,A Frankstenstein spoof that brought a few chuckles.,6,11 September 2015,"Director Mel Brooks' take on ""Frankenstein"" brings you some chuckles as you see Dr. Frankenstein's (Gene Wilder) inherit the castle that belonged to his late grandfather and decides to continue his research. He resurrects the body of a criminal into a Frankenstein Monster, a more twisted but funny version of the original monster played by the late Peter Boyle.Joined by a supporting cast of assistant Igor (Marty Feldman), love interest Inga (Teri Garr), fiancée Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn), housekeeper Frau Blücher (Cloris Leachman) and Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars), each brought some whacky performances and made the somewhat slow-moving plot a little more entertaining. However, I've seen more funnier stuff, though, as I expected that there would be more laugh-out-loud moments and slapstick fun in this film. Some of the dialog was campy at best, particularly the subtle sexual humor, and you could hardly hear what Kenneth Mars' character is saying. Overall, it's an average comedy. Fine to watch for some mild scares and some mild laughs. Grade C+",Young Frankenstein
52,Red-Barracuda,Loving and funny spoof of the Universal 'Frankenstein' movies,8,2 September 2013,"In his heyday, Mel Brooks was the most skilled specialist in parody films. He tackled all manner of genres but Young Frankenstein is possibly his best. In this one the target was 1930's Universal horror movies, or more specifically the 'Frankenstein' films. What makes this one work so well is that, aside from Brooks' typical crazed humour; there is a real attempt to capture the look and feel of those old movies it is satirizing. The sumptuous black and white photography and the elaborate sets all recall the Universal 'Frankenstein' outings. And overall there is an unmistakable loving care at work. Brooks is definitely respectful of the films he is parodying and this ensures that they have not only the laughs but a fine attention to detail. Quite a few of the funniest moments require audience familiarity with the source movies, so Young Frankenstein is not simply pandering to easy laughs but working in specific references as well.The other thing that really helps massively is the cast. Gene Wilder is undoubtedly the star of the show as the title character. This film really shows why he remains one of the funniest cinema actors of all time. Peter Boyle's portrayal of the monster is a good rival to Boris Karloff's original but with great comic timing – his performance of 'Puttin' on the Ritz' is inspired hilarity. While Gene Hackman is hilarious as the blind hermit, his scene with Boyle is comic gold from start to finish and is one of the undoubted highlights of the movie. To be fair, like all Brooks movies, this is still somewhat uneven in bits. Some of the humour doesn't really work so well. Marty Feldman, for example, looks really funny but his comic delivery is pretty poor. But in the main, the jokes still work more than they do not. On the whole it's a great looking, funny film.",Young Frankenstein
53,llltdesq,An incredibly funny and affectionate send-up of the horror film in general and Frankenstein films in particular,10,13 September 2001,There really isn't much I can say that doubtless someone else hasn't said. Brooks used the same location and sets that were used for the lab scenes in the original 1931 James Whale version.  Anyone who doesn't laugh at either the scene with Gene Hackman as a blind hermit or the scene where Marty Feldman and Gene Wilder are discussing the brain that Feldman brought for transplant has absolutely no pulse whatsoever.  Gloriously funny from start to finish.  Kenneth Mars is a hoot and Liam Dunn is a scream in one of the most painful-looking funny scenes in cinematic history!  Most Highly Recommended.,Young Frankenstein
54,thesar-2,Born Again,8,3 September 2016,"Wait. Who's ""young?"" I guess they all look ""young"" to us now, 42 years laterI guess it only took the same number of years since my birth to finally name my favorite Mel Brooks movie and my second favorite Gene Wilder film (the number one, See No Evil, Hear No Evil, always has a special place in my heart from Wilder.) While not every joke worked – this coming from someone seeing this over four decades too late for the first time, I truly laughed out loud many, many times. So much past humor has held up and it was nice to see how Brooks simultaneously made a spoof and a real Frankenstein adaptation. Grandson ""Fronkensteen"" does a 180 on his teachings against reanimation when he inherits ""something"" (they're never clear) from his grandfather, the original Dr. Frankenstein. Within moments of the grandson's arrival at his Grandfather's creepy castle, he recreates life and they all put on the ritz. It's funny speaking about this movie now, so late to the game, but it feels like I just discovered it back in the mid-70s. I love comedies that are so well crafted, no matter when they came out, that when I continuously think of them following, or see clips from the very movie I just watched, and I am laughing even more. I know this is a cult him for a bunch of people ever since it was first released. I believe it will become one for me now. Can't wait to see it again. ***Final thoughts: Part II in my tribute the wonderful comedian, Gene Wilder, who passed on earlier this week. So far, I've seen (both for the first time): The Producers and Young Frankenstein. I'm going to try and watch Stir Crazy, also for the first time. If, I can fit it in, I'll be revisiting See No Evil, Hear No Evil for the finale and probably my 20th time viewing. RIP Gene.",Young Frankenstein
55,cherold,Mel Brooks' best film,10,4 April 2017,"For me, this is certaily Mel Brooks' best, funniest movie. To be fair, this is in part because I watched all the old 40s monsters movies it was parodying. This makes scenes like the one with the blind man extra funny because they are so close to the original scenes. Perhaps the people who aren't as enthusiastic as I am about this just haven't seen Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein (if you haven't seen Bride of Frankenstein, you have not full lived life).The cast is amazing. Everyone is incredible, but Marty Feldman manages to still outshine everyone else. Everything he says and does is hilarious.The movie is full of great gags (whinnying horses, movable hump) and set pieces (the life-or-death game of charades, Putting on the Ritz). The cast is clearly having a blast, giving the movie the feel of old-school burlesque comedy.The filming is amazing. The lighting and camera work are *exactly* like in the originals; I wouldn't be surprised if they used vintage cameras to film it all. Few movies show this degree of loving recreation.I could not love this movie more. For me, it is one of the all-time great comedies alongside Holy Grail and The Hudsucker Proxy.",Young Frankenstein
56,theowinthrop,All You Need Is Love....,9,5 January 2007,"It is not as good as BLAZING SADDLES or THE PRODUCERS or two other Brooks movies that I am fond of: THE TWELVE CHAIRS and Dracula: DEAD AND LOVING IT. But YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is in Mel Brooks' best films, possibly because for all it's puns, jokes, spoofs, and fun it actually takes a moment to invert the actual novella by Mary Shelley and show what could have been the answer.Reading FRANKENSTEIN and seeing it's various incarnations on the movie screen and on television are two different things. Except for occasional documentaries on the history channel near Halloween, most people don't know the origins of the story - just perhaps some vague thoughts regarding the story of the Golem, perhaps, or of some of the odd early electricity experiments conducted by Alexander Volta and his contemporaries on dead frog's leg muscles or on executed criminals. You would also be surprised, in reading the story, to find that most versions on the screens delete a whole portion dealing with Captain Robert Walton's attempt to reach the North Pole by ship (a comparative nightmare that is nearly as deadly to Walton's crew as Victor Frankenstein's experiment is to his family and friends). Yet the tale is so powerful it almost always keeps it's audience attention.Here Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder update the story to 20th Century America, where Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (or Frankensteen, as he insists it is pronounced) is trying to live down his cracked grandfather's experiments. He's a successful brain surgeon and expert, and he reluctantly returns to Transylvania and the family castle to collect an inheritance. In the end he gives into the family tradition - as he says during a nightmare he can't escape his destiny. With Marty Feldman as his hunchback assistant (disgusted by Wilder's change of name pronunciation, he calls Wilder ""Froderick"" and himself ""Whygor""), and Teri Garr as Inger the lab assistant, and Cloris Leachman as Blucher (note off stage horse whinny) as the enthusiastic house keeper, he creates Peter Boyle, only to turn from his creation when he learns it has gotten an abnormal brain by accident.But there is a major change in the story. In the novel Victor gradually realizes that his creation is hideous, and tries to destroy it - only to find it has hate for him in it's heart and destroys anything Victor loves (including his wife on their wedding night, and his best friend). The monster eventually pursues it's creator to his death, and then reveals to Captain Walton that it realizes that Victor was also the father it should have loved - and will destroy itself on a funeral pyre at the end. There is a hopelessness in the novel for the monster's predicament. Nobody is willing to accept the Monster - it's so ugly and frightening.But in the film, Wilder and Brooks offered an alternative in the modern world. While not losing sight of the ridiculous opportunities for the comedy (culminating in Wilder and Boyle dancing and singing ""Putting on the Ritz"") the screenplay writers also point out that had Victor been kinder to his ""son"" and treated him with love and understanding (as Wilder demonstrates to Boyle), then the frightful destructiveness and evil of the monster would never have occurred. It is when Frederick treats the monster nicely that Boyle's monster grows into a more stable character, reaching out to Wilder's sudden interest to bring it acceptance from the locals. And in the end the monster finally gets the social acceptance he failed to find in the novella.I don't wish the reader to think YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is an ultra serious film. Boyle's dancing and singing ""Putting on the RItz"" is worth watching the film for, as is Gene Hackman's cameo (based on the blind hermit played by O. P. Heggie in THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN) - only this blind hermit can't do anything for the monster but accidentally scald or burn it, driving it out of the hermit's home in a panic. Bits like Kenneth Mars' police chief, cheating in a game of darts with Wilder (and Wilder manages to injure a cat and hit Mars limousine and chauffeur's hat) or Madeleine Kahn's refusal to allow her lover to kiss or touch her (she is perfectly prepared for a society party she was invited too - in the end she and Wilder say their farewells by ""shaking"" their elbows!) are wonderful pieces of nonsense. It does succeed in achieving the amusement of the audience who watches it - what more can one do than achieve the main goal of any Hollywood film, particularly a comedy. It merits eight out of ten.",Young Frankenstein
57,Lejink,Monster bash,7,15 January 2011,"Mel Brooks' loving tribute to old-time Hollywood horror. Of course no Brooks make-over could be complete without a stock number of jokes older than Frankenstein's castle, a smattering of smut and appearances by pretty much his repertory company (Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Madeleine Khan and that's only in the lead roles), although it was soon after this movie that Mel started writing parts for himself.The titles, for a start are lovingly laid out diagonally, in best MGM style, the cinematography is excellently composed in monochrome and the sets, too, are quite superb. The plot bowdlerises every monster flick you've ever seen and a lot of the gags you can see coming with bells on, (does the ""walk this way"" routine appear in every Brooks' film?), but with the wonderful Gene Wilder at its centre, hair and eyebrows everywhere, ably assisted by made-for-this-kind-of-thing actors like Feldman, Khan et al, you can forgive even the worst puns. I did think, however, that both female leads, Khan and Teri Garr, could have been used a little more.Best gags for me were Wilder's lecture to his students (loved the aside, ""Give him an extra buck"" to the old stooge dragged out for experimental purposes) and the monster's consummation with the previously frigid Khan (""Oh sweet mystery of life"") but the humour is spread around everyone to humorous effect.It made me feel a bit like a kid watching a pantomime and while the cinematography would have you think otherwise there are no pretensions of high art here. It's your belly laughs he's after and he gets them here, in spades.",Young Frankenstein
58,ElMaruecan82,To call it a spoof is almost insulting ...,10,18 March 2012,"""Young Frankenstein"" isn't just funny, it's a masterpiece that transcends every standard of comedy with such brilliance and grace that calling it a parody or a spoof is almost insulting. After watching ""Young Frankenstein"", I discovered that it was only nominated for 2 Oscars: Best Sound and Best Original Screenplay (co-written with Mel Brooks from Gene Wilder's original draft). Had the movie been nominated for other awards, it wouldn't have surprised me: the photography is top notch and perfectly renders the feeling of old 30's horror classics, the black and white cinematography perfectly conveys the haunting shadowy atmosphere of the original ""Frankenstein"", the score is perfect for the story, Mel Brooks' directing never seemed so tactful and professional and I can think of any of the main cast deserving a nod for the acting. I guess that the film being released the same year than ""Chinatown"" or ""The Godfather Part II"" didn't help; Mel Brooks wasn't the only one at the top of his game.But let's get back to ""Young Frankenstein"". Besides being an undeniable technical achievement, the film is an excellent comedy that contains some of the most hilarious lines and moments in cinematic history and certainly the greatest comedic cast ever (thunders' sound effects to emphasize). Indeed, each actor, each actress occupies the screen with a unique magnetism, starting by Gene Wilder, the one with whom it all started. As Wilder said, he wondered how he would act if he was the descendant of the infamous Baron Viktor von Frankenstein, the answer couldn't have been more intelligent and hilarious. The Professor is so ashamed of his affiliation that he wants his name to be pronounced 'Fron-kon-steene', but this attitude reflects an interesting contradiction as he finally realizes he can't escape his destiny and must go to Transylvania to accomplish the same miracle than his glorious ancestor. After a decent start, Mel Brooks 'elevates' the film.The doctor meets a wonderful gallery of colorful characters, the voluptuous assistant Inga, played by Teri Garr, in a knock-out performance, Cloris Leachman as the frightening Frau Blücher whose any mention of her name never ceases to make the horses rear in fright, and there is Fronkonsteen's fiancée, in a role that could have been secondary if it wasn't for Madeline Kahn's extraordinary scene-stealing ability. The film also features Kenneth Mars barely recognizable in his policeman's disguise, and an even less recognizable performance by Gene Hackman as a well-mannered blind man (I can't believe I missed it during the first viewing). But in all cinematic objectivity, the film's greatness relies on two pillar performances, and I'll start with the most memorable one.First, there's Marty Fedlman's role as Igor (pronounced eye-gor) as the hunchback and butler of the Transylvanian mansion. Igor's character inspired what would remain for me the greatest character's introduction in any comedy, with this sudden and unforgettable close-up on his smile and incredibly bulged eyes. To appreciate the comical talent of Feldman requires both a voracious appetite and a gourmet's delicacy. His comical genius can take you totally off- guard when his face shows up from nowhere, or when he ad-libs a scene -I won't say which but it's so hysterical that even Gene Wilder looks like he's totally losing it- OR you just have to pay attention to his mimics, his reactions when a gag is already over, and realize that Igor himself, is a punchline within a punchline. The ""What hump?"" moment is pure comedic gold.The other pillar is of course Peter Boyle as the Creature, monster is too cruel a word to even be used on this gentle giant with high-pitched screams and touching hobby of catching imaginary butterflies in the air. Boyle beautifully incarnates the syndrome of the misunderstood monster and the spirit of Mary Shelley's novel. And this epitomizes the merit and the force of ""Young Frankenstein"": each actor and actresses doesn't play a character, but reinvent a role with such an intensity that the film stands alone as a classic. Of course, it has all the elements of the ""Frankenstein"" series, but you don't need to be a fan to appreciate Mel Brooks' film on its own. It's not just a masterpiece of stylish copy, it's a masterpiece as a story, as an ambiance, as an ensemble cast performance, as a comedy where visual and written comedy works in perfect harmony (the farewell in the train station scene is a perfect demonstration) I often blamed ""Blazing Saddles"" for being too broad on the parody-thing, and to let the movie evolve to an extreme where the humor ceased to be enjoyable story-wise and overused the whole meta-referential jokes, almost insisting upon itself until a throw-away climax. ""Young Frankenstein"" doesn't evoke itself; it doesn't try to imitate but succeeds in duplicating an atmosphere to provide a whole other reaction from the audience. And the adaptation is so original that it can be regarded as one of the greatest 'Frankenstein' films, any genre combined, and Peter Boyle's performance has nothing to envy on Boris Karloff, it's simply  magical and it contributes to one of the highlights of the film.Indeed, if you wanted a last proof that ""Young Frankenstein"" is an original classic, forever rooted in cinematic memories, just start singing this: ""If you're blue and you don't know where to go to why don't you go where fashion sits"" any movie expert would say ""Puttin' in the Ritz"" referring to some Fred Astaire dance routine, but a true movie lover would immediately reply ""PUDDIN' ON A RHEEEEEEZ"" in a high-pitched voice. The movie features one of the most hilarious musical duets ever that would make even the most abnormal brain laugh.And if only for that piece of hilarity, Mel Brooks's masterpiece ""Young Frankenstein"" deserves to its place as one of the funniest films ever, it's raunchy, outrageous, irreverent, poetic, sensitive, inventive and as would shout the Creature: ""OOPAH DOOPAH""",Young Frankenstein
59,dromasca,"young Frankenstein, mature Mel Brooks",8,21 August 2019,"'Crazy Movies Club' is the name of the cycle in which our local cinema included Mel Brooks' ' Young Frankenstein '. I think it's a very appropriate setting for the Brooklyn-born comedy creator's personality, though this movie is one of the more 'restraint' ones in his successful career as an author and director of comedies and parodies for the big screen. Everything is relative, of course, as we are dealing with Mel Brooks.Having managed the breakthrough with 'The Producers' in the late 60s, the 70s were for Mel Brooks the years of consecration. Most of his films from this period were parodies of the classic genres of American cinema, or in other words 'Hollywood parodies Hollywood'. What sets Mel Brooks apart from other parody filmmakers who followed (and imitated) him is the audacity to break Hollywood's film and censorship conventions, but especially his deep knowledge and respect for the film genres that he is approaching. Mel Brooks' kind of respect, of course. In the case of 'Young Frankenstein', the original story lines from Mary Shelley's novels and classic horror films from the 1930s are taken. The film is filmed in black and white, Mel Brooks being one of the first directors to understand the stylistic value of working with 'vintage' technical means. Even sets from the classic Frankenstein films made 40 years ago were reused. On top of all this, however, a healthy dose of Mel Brooks' craziness was added.Some of the comical ideas and many gags are memorable. At some moment the actors started to improvise, and being excellent comedy actors, the result is that they have fun and entertain us, the viewers. Gene Wilder (who also participated in writing the script) is perfectly in the role of the young Frankenstein who travels to Transylvania following in the footsteps of his famous and controversial grandfather, resuming his comical and frightening experiences and adventures. Marty Feldman is a tailor made partner, with an uncommon sense of humor. I was less impressed with Peter Boyle who could never forget Boris Karloff, but instead I was delighted with Gene Hackman , an actor whom I particularly appreciate, in an episodic composition role. Even if it doesn't reach the maximum level of comedic intensity of Mel Brooks' best films, 'Young Frankenstein' remains a quality entertainment today.",Young Frankenstein
60,Cineanalyst,Spooky Spoof,9,24 August 2018,"""Young Frankenstein"" feels like a bonus for having viewed the Universal Frankenstein series, from the 1931 film to the monster's meeting Abbott and Costello in 1948, all of which have some pleasurable aspects in themselves. In fact, I've seen near 50 Frankenstein films thus far since re-reading Mary Shelley's novel, but ""Young Frankenstein"" only parodies the 1930s-1940s classics and mostly just the first three entries. It's probably fun on its own, but I find it especially rewarding to spot which parts of it refer to which particular Frankenstein film and how Mel Brooks, Gene Wilder and company alter them for humorous effect.Some may dismiss ""Young Frankenstein"" for a script and style that imitates and reworks prior films, but that's no easy task itself, as evidenced by so many parodies failing in those regards. Brooks's 1995 ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It,"" for instance, suffers from a lackluster reiteration of the plot from the 1931 ""Dracula,"" which itself was a rather stagy adaptation, and is almost devoid of any interesting style. ""Young Frankenstein,"" on the other hand, may be the most concise narrative and best looking Brooks film, as it takes some of the best bits narratively and stylistically from, mainly, three Frankenstein entries that are each great films in themselves.Filmed in black and white and beginning with a plot similar to ""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939), Wilder's Frederick Frankenstein (who insists on the pronunciation of ""Fronkensteen"") is a lecturer who inherits his ancestor's castle and, subsequently, his experiments in reanimating cadavers. He's assisted by the hunchbacked Igor (pronounced ""eye-gore"")--a conglomeration of the Ygor from ""Son of Frankenstein"" and the hunchback Fritz from the first film in the series--as well as by a promiscuous young female lab assistant and an old maid, who clearly had a sexual relationship with his late ancestor (come to think of it, this is the only part that may point to the Hammer series, in which Frankenstein had an affair with his maid). As in the 1931 ""Frankenstein,"" the doctor and the hunchback rob graves, stitch a body together and give it life via electric gizmos and lightning. The little Maria scene is also lampooned, followed by the scene with the blind man adapted from Shelley's novel in ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935). Madeline Kahn's Elizabeth also references the original sequel when her hair gains the iconic streaks of white lightning and she sports a Nefertiti hairdo, whereas the final gag involving some sort of brain transference tweaks the plotlines of the more B-picture type Frankenstein films, including ""The Ghost of Frankenstein"" (1942) and ""House of Frankenstein"" (1944). And, of course, there's the monster's fear of fire, his attraction to violin playing and some angry mobs, as well as an over-the-top Inspector Kemp mocking the role played by Lionel Atwill in ""Son of Frankenstein."" In addition to these gags, there are unexpected moments of hilarity--most remarkably, Frankenstein and his monster performing ""Puttin' on the Ritz.""Overall, this is a loving spoof of the Universal series. It's because those original films were so good that this parody works.",Young Frankenstein

63,jacobjohntaylor1,One of the funniest movie of all time,9,4 March 2016,This movie is very funny. The mean characters are the grand son of Doctor Frankenstein The grand son of Ygor and a monster that they created. This movie is a satire of the Frankenstein movies from the 30's and 40's. I am a big fan off these movies. And I fine this movie to be very funny. One the funniest movies I have ever seen. It got an 8 but is such a great movie that 8 is underrating it. I do not like a lot of comedy movies. And I have to say this is one of the better ones. Mel Brooks is a great director. Most film directors do not know what funny is. But he does know. Gene Wilder is great actor and writer. Mel Brooks is also and great writer. This movie is a most. If you want to laugh see this movie.,Young Frankenstein
64,redryan64,"Mel & Gene,Successfully Walking Hollywood Tightrope in this YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, Universal Horror Movie Spoof project.",10,5 July 2007,"Mel Brooks was riding the crest of success in the 1970's.The all around Funnyman (Writer, Actor, Stand Up, etc.,)had quite a string of successes in screen comedies' writing. Starting as a writer with the Sid Ceasar -Imogene Coca TV Super series, YOUR SHOW of SHOWS (1950), Mel found steady work and progressively more success with many projects, leading up to GET SMART (1965).The Big Screened Medium then beckoned and we were treated to such cinematic treats as THE PRODUCERS (1968), THE 12 CHAIRS (1970) and in 1974 both Western Spoof Extrodinaire, BLAZING SADDLES and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.Being a parody of the Universal Horror Films of the 1930's and '40's, there was plenty to spoof. But a parody (or a satire or lampoon or even a burlesque, if you will)has to be carefully handled less the take-off would be so powerful as to do a number on the spoofed subject. This would likely be a desired effect in a political commercial, but not so in a film parody/comedy/farce.Collaborative writer/star, Gene Wilder and Writer/Director Mel Brooks are charged with having to carefully choose the gags and situations so as to bring the greatest number of genuine laughs, and at the same time maintain a respect and reverence for the old Horror Genre. Judging by the final product, Messers Brooks and Wilder must have been big fans of the Universal Pictures' films of that period. The delicate balance between fun and ridicule is maintained , all to the good.The Cast of Gene Wilder, Terri Garr, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Madeline Kahn , Cloris Leachman and Blind Hermit, Gene Hackman all are up to the occasion of the day. Veteran actors Rolfe Sedan, Liam Dunn and Oscar Beregi all do yeoman's jobs in supporting, pivotal roles.The big surprise of the film and perhaps giving the greatest comic performance of his career is Mr. Kenneth Mars. His characterization of Police Inspector Kemp is the scene stealer of the whole film. He provides an actor who is up to the high level of the comic writing.* The sets for the film were all in keeping with the old Universal Pictures' practice of filming the 'scary' movies in both a Medieval Castle Set and in some realistic looking European Village digs.** In some respect, the scenery appeared uncannily the same.YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN also boasted of ""Original, Old Frankenstein Laboratory Equipment"".***Its presence cannot be given enough credit for giving the finished Film the 'just perfect' touch.Lastly, we read recently that the 20th Century-Fox ""suits"" wanted and even insisted on filming in 'Living Color'. Both Brooks and Wilder were insistent, even obstinate, on using glorious Black & White. (the Fox people may have also just presumed that it would be a color film, because, hey, nobody made B & W movies then!) Mr. Brooks and Mr. Wilder reasoned that the B & W film was the right way to go, because that was the predominant medium used the '30's and '40's. Luckily, for sake of the production, and, we the people who make up the ""movie going public."" So, the film story starts out with scene and gag, ever moving along at a finely timed, yet mad pace. There is no wasted time, no 'padded' or extending of a scene its optimum length.For a Film Comedy (or Farce, if you will) it is near perfection. And as for its being a ""spoof"", ditto and 4 Stars for YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.* We know that film success is a collaborative effort of Writer, Director and Actor. In the final analysis, a poor performance by any Actor can and will render the part failed.** Universal had a really great Medieval Castle set , which got plenty of use in their Horror Genere films, featured in FRANKENSTEIN & sequels, Dracula & Sequels and THE WOLFMAN. The great ""German Village"" set, constructed for ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (1930), was used frequently and shot from every different conceivable angle, in just about every classic Horror film of theirs.*** A Special ""Thank You"" was included in the credits for providing original, old Frankenstein Lab Equipment of his, which dated to the 1930's.",Young Frankenstein

Wilder is at his best playing the title character with his subtlety when least expected and his wildness too.  There are too many great scenes to mention and too many great things to say about about this film.

I didn't stop laughing for over a week. I don't want to give it away, but those who know this movie know what I'm talking about.I must have been around nine when I first saw this movie and I giggled my butt of because it was so funny.

He carries the movie on his back. Dr. Frankenstein is witty, has a sharp tongue, and is sarcastic when needed. Peter Boyle is an instant favorite! His physical comedy is great! I dug his encounter with the blind man for example. That was the funniest scene in the movie. Marty Feldman was the goof-head that worked perfectly for the movie's tone.Teri Garr is absolutely hot! The woman is so sensual and hot it made me feel uneasy. Her breasts are glorious! She's funny as the dumb assistant.Some classical scenes include the little girl in the swing, the encounter with the blind man, the whole Frau Blucher name, Frankenstein finding Igor's head in the shelves, the infamous but hilarious sex scene, the musical moment that spoofs ""King Kong""; and more.This is a very complete comedy.

Soon, he inherits his late, grandfather's castle in Transylvania and discovers his work of re-animation which forces him to continue where he left off. The late, Boyle (Everybody Loves Raymond) plays Frederick's monster creation that's not only afraid of fire, but seeks love, Garr (Mr. Mom) plays Frederick's lab assistant, Inga, the late, Feldman plays hunchback, Igor who also helps him, Leachman (The Beverly Hillbillies) plays Frau, the housekeeper, the late, Kahn (Blazing Saddles) plays Elizabeth, Frederick's fiancée and Gene Hackman (Superman) also appears briefly as blind man, Harold.

He meets Igor(Marty Ingles), along with some other weird characters. I was laughing non- stop. I also liked when after they built the monster(Peter Boyle), the scene with the blind hermit(Gene Hackman) was classic. I laughed the hardest when it came to the lighting of the cigar. The monster got his thumb of fire. In the story, fire is the monster's weakness. With all the characters from the Shelley's novel, this movie is more funny than scary.

70,FiendishDramaturgy,Brooks' genius at its heighth,9,23 October 2003,"One of my generations' most loved movies and one of Mel Brooks's best works.Brilliant casting, comedic Mel Brooks genius, and some of the best performances since Ten Commandments is what you will get with this 1974 spoof of the Mary Shelley classic. While Brooks's comedic style is somewhat of an acquired taste, and either hits or misses almost instantly, ""Young Frankenstein"" was not only a more intellectual endeavor than his wildly successful ""Blazing Saddles,"" but like ""Blazing Saddles,"" has stood up under (almost) thirty years of scrutiny. Watching ""Young Frankenstein"" today, it is just as funny, and just as clever, as it was when it was first done.Gene Wilder brilliantly portrays the grandson of Baron Victor Von Frankenstein; an unwilling heir to his genius, his castle, and all the knowledge the infamous doctor had in his possession. Terri Garr is perfectly cast as the finger-in-the-mouth, knee-bent into the other knee, dumb blond, easy-to-seduce lab assistant to the young Dr.Frankenstein. And Marty Feldman had never been better cast in a role in his entire career, as Igor, Frankenstein's right hand...man.Complete with a cameo by Gene Hackman, and Peter Boyles as ""the Monster."" The running gags throughout the movie are a bit weak, admittedly, but the overall genius of the film leaves no doubt that Mel Brooks captured something almost magickal in his direction of this wonderful homage.No wonder that the use of the English language was so well prescribed in this marvelous production. It was co-written by Gene Wilder himself, as a comedic adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel.As a classic in the comedy field, this fine Mel Brooks production has withstood the tests of time and stands with a brilliant line of classic parodies directed by Brooks.If you liked this movie, please give ""Spaceballs"" a try. It is another brilliant parody, this time of the ""Star Wars"" series by George Lucas.I also highly recommend ""The History of the World, Part 1,"" also by Brooks. It is an irreverent look at our biblical past. ""Life Stinks,"" another parody, this time of the legendary comedic effort by Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy entitled, ""Trading Places."" And last but certainly not least, ""Blazing Saddles,"" a brilliant, well received parody of the western films of America's recent past.It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",Young Frankenstein
71,bsmith5552,Classic Mel Brooks,8,10 August 2003,"1974 was a good year for both Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder. They both hit back to back home runs with ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Blazing Saddles"" that year. ""Young Frankenstein"" as you would expect is a spoof on the classic Universal Pictures horror flicks of the 30's and early 40s. Wilder developed the original concept and Brooks was brought in later to direct and ended up co-writing the final script. Frederick von Frankenstein...pronounced ""FrankenstEEn""(Wilder) the grandson of the evil Victor von Frankenstein returns to his ancestral home upon the death of his father. There he meets the hunch backed dwarf Igor...pronounce ""EYEgor"" (Marty Feldman), his voluptuous ""lab assistant"" Inga (Terri Garr) and at the castle, the sinister Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman). After hearing a mysterious violin, Frederick stumbles upon the laboratory of his ancestor. He then decides to create his own being which turns out to be Peter Boyle. The monster of course escapes and lampoons all of the cliches from the old movies including encounters with a little girl and a blind hermit. Later Frederick's fiance, Elizabeth (Madeliene Kahn) arrives and well..we have a foursome. Investigating all of the surrounding mayhem is Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars) in a hilarious send up of the Lionel Atwill character from ""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939). The film was shot in black and white to give it that ""classic look"". All of the horror cliches are there. We have the dark shadows, creaking doors and the classic original set pieces, the secret passage behind the revolving bookcase, the whinny of the horses at the mention of the name ""Frau Brucher"", the graveyard sequence, the town people's riot etc. The film is perfectly cast. Wilder is hilarious in the lead role. Garr in her first major part, is sexy and innocent as Inga, Madeleine Kahn is fantastic as ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", Marty Feldman (with the bulgy rolling eyes) is unforgettable as Igor, Peter Boyle is equally funny as the monster (his musical number with Wilder is a hoot) and Kenneth Mars is great as Inspector Kemp with the artificial arm. Watch how Igor's hump and Kemp's arm change from one side to the other. If you haven't seen the film, you'll have fun identifying the famous actor doing a cameo as the blind hermit ""Harold"". This one is not to be missed. It's probably no coincidence that both Brooks and Wilder's greatest cinematic successes were in ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Blazing Saddles"". It's a pity that they didn't collaborate on other projects.",Young Frankenstein
72,ackstasis,"""For what we are about to see next, we must enter quietly into the realm of genius.""",8,3 June 2007,"James Whale's 1931 film 'Frankenstein' is rightly considered a timeless classic, perhaps the most famous and influential of all horror films. Curiously, I was to discover, despite the original's enduring stature, this 1974 spoof/homage by Mel Brooks is quite often considered a superior effort. Something of a hit-or-miss comedy director, Brooks discovered a stroke of brilliance in 1974, also releasing his popular western spoof comedy 'Blazing Saddles,' which I must really get around to seeing one of these days. Shot in black and white, 'Young Frankenstein' brilliantly and respectfully captures the essence of the 1931 film, complemented by hilarious performances from Gene Wilder, Peter Boyle, Marty Feldman, Teri Garr, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman and Kenneth Mars.Decades after his grandfather succeeded in his experiment to reanimate dead flesh, publicly-skeptical Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Wilder)  pronounced, we are told, ""Frderick Fronkenshteen""  travels to Transylvania to take over the infamous castle and laboratory. Here, aided by his hunch-backed assistant Igor (Feldman)  pronounced ""Eye-gor""  Frankenstein rediscovers his grandfather's work, and so commits himself to reanimating a dead body of his own. Eventually, he succeeds in his experiment, and a hideous, bad-tempered and child-like Creature (Boyle) is risen from the dead.Peter Boyle  best known to television audiences as the rude, obnoxious and infectiously hilarious Frank Barone from 'Everybody Loves Raymond'  is brilliant in the role of the Monster, his comedic timing perfect, despite being restricted to random growls and grunts until the movie's final scenes. It struck me quite hard when Boyle passed away in December of 2006; we'd really lost a genuine comedic talent, and his performance here is yet more proof. Gene Wilder is very good in the title role, playing his character really quite seriously, and so getting a lot of the laughs. Marty Feldman is highly-memorable as the withered and slimy assistant Igor, whether it be for the awkwardly-shifting hump on his back, or the hilariously absurd dialogue (""My grandfather used to work for your grandfather. Of course the rates have gone up""). Particularly funny is the scene where Igor mistakenly steals the wrong brain to be reanimated, this particular one belonging to a certain person with the curious name of ""Abbie Normal!""In order to fully capture the mood of Whale's 1931 classic horror, Brooks borrowed the same props and lab equipment from the original film. However, occasionally the film departs from that classic feel, most notably in the totally unexpected and sidesplittingly-funny musical rendition of 'Puttin' on the Ritz,' featuring Wilder and Boyle. That was undoubtedly my very favourite moment in the film. Another great scene features Gene Hackman in a cameo appearance as a lonely blind-man who makes the mistake of offering a rampaging Frankenstein some hot soup, some ale and a cigar.",Young Frankenstein
73,Coxer99,Young Frankenstein,10,4 June 1999,"Zany spoof of the Frankenstein films with a superb script from Brooks and off the wall performances from Wilder, Boyle, Leachman and Kahn. Still, the funniest scene in the film belongs to Hackman, in an impressive cameo as the blind man (Bride of Frankenstein) who befriends Boyle's creature by offering him a cigar and...well, you can imagine the results. This was Brooks' best year; he had this and his other classic ""Blazing Saddles,"" rolling together in the motion theatres.

Dr Frankenstein is initially sceptical about taking residence in his late great-grandfather's castle, but soon becomes interested when he discovers his great-grandfather's private library. Armed with a book from this library and a corpse Frankenstein begins 'experimenting' with potentially disastrous consequences.I tried watching this film in its entirety on two occasions - first time I fell asleep halfway through and being the sort of person who can't pick up on a film the next day from the halfway point I started the film again the following day. The second time I made it to about 15 minutes from the end and gave up again. I decided not to start again and just watched the last 15 minutes just so that I can say that I watched it all. That just goes to show how bored I was when watching this film....The problem I had with this film is that the story for me was very weak and rather repetitive. I also found large portions of the film unfunny simply because very little was done with the character of The Monster - I mean he's got an abnormal brain so why not make the film funnier by showing him being crazy all the time and doing made things? Poor Peter Boyle was just left grunting and snarling and whilst this perhaps is more of an accurate reflection of how The Monster behaves it doesn't make for a very good comedy film in my opinion.Wilder gives a rather Marmite performance here; infectious and amusing in the early stages, but his overacting gets worse and worse as the film progresses and he started to become tiresome towards the end. Many of the other performances are OK, but it's clear that Brooks' approach here was the louder the better - there is lots of shouting and noise which is unbearable and irritating at times.This isn't an out and out failure and there are certainly some amusing moments; the bookcase scene was brilliant and I also found it funny when Frankenstein and his creation were both singing and dancing to the song 'Putting On The Ritz'. However I only laughed twice in the 100 minute running time and I'm somewhat puzzled by the high ratings that it's getting on IMDb. I haven't seen the Frankenstein films of old so perhaps that's part of the problem. However, given the fact that this is billed as a Comedy and due to its high rating I expected to be laughing consistently and in that respect I can't help but feel a little short-changed.",Young Frankenstein

I finally got around to watch it and now understand why it has the reputation it does.Gene Wilder is hilarious as our protagonist. He plays the role perfectly and the supporting casts plays beautifully off of him. A real highlight was Marty Feldman as Igor who has some really funny lines.The set design for this one is very impressive for a comedy. The original Frankenstein set is the perfect aesthetic for Mel Brooks mood and tone he is delivering. The score only adds to these elements.It's not a perfect comedy and not all of the jokes hold up by today's standards but it's still got a bunch of good laughs and it's an enjoyable time.,Young Frankenstein
78,slokes,"Promethean Wilder, Subtle Brooks Shine",9,19 December 2003,"There's a lot of amazing things about ""Young Frankenstein."" To start with, it was made fast on the heels of one of the all-time comedy classics, ""Blazing Saddles,"" which director Mel Brooks was still editing while he simultaneously shot ""Young Frankenstein."" The films opened months apart in 1974, and ""Young Frankenstein"", while a very different and less wild comedy than ""Blazing Saddles,"" hardly suffered from the juxtaposition. They are still considered by most people Mel Brooks' #1 and #2 comedies, perhaps the #1 and #2 comedies of the 1970s. The only question may be which is which.I just feel blessed to be in a world with both. ""Blazing Saddles"" is funnier, it broke conventions and made anarchy into an art form. It's a greater comedy than ""Young Frankenstein,"" and a more significant work of art. But ""Young Frankenstein"" is the better film. It has a heart. You are encouraged not just to laugh, but to feel, feel for the pathetic, confused monster; for his vainglorious creator; for the sad crone who pines for her long-dead love and winces with real hurt when the horses whinny at the sound of her name. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. And it's so funny, it's deadly.Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks clearly needed each other more than either cared to admit. As other posters note, they never collaborated after this film, and neither had much good to show for their separation (Wilder did have another collaboration or two left with Richard Pryor, so he did a little better, but choosing between ""Life Stinks"" and ""Funny About Love"" is a dog's breakfast to be sure.) Look how mightily Wilder roars. In his DVD commentary, Brooks calls Wilder's performance ""more than brilliant, it's Promethean."" Wilder's Dr. Fronk-En-Steen is en fuego indeed, screaming with more passion than Wilder bestowed on all his subsequent roles combined. His wild hair, his lustful ravishings of Madeline Kahn and Teri Garr, his jabbing a scalpel in his thigh, is the stuff of inspired genius, and shows a comic actor at the top of his game. Brooks, by contrast, plays it relatively straight, letting the script go for the laughs while he concentrates on setting up the actors and establishing the film's brilliant mood, which plays off the original Universal Frankenstein films in a clearly respectful but nevertheless playfully satirical way. As caustic and scatological as he was in ""Blazing Saddles,"" Brooks is sweet and disciplined here. The vulgarity is minimal, the sex jokes are less obvious, and there's a real story to follow.The ensemble cast also helps. They play off each other like a polished orchestra, to the point where you can't really pick a favorite character. At least for me, it changes. Marty Feldman is the audience manqué as the charmingly weird EYE-gor, Cloris Leachman (the only member of the cast to ever win an Oscar, but for ""The Last Picture Show"") is goofy and sinister at the same time as Frau Blucher [""He vas my BOYFRIEND!""] Actresses have never come as simultaneously sexy and hilarious as Teri Garr, who has fun with her accent and her eyes. Peter Boyle projects youthful innocence and fear as the Monster, cashing it all in comedically in his ""Putting On The Ritz"" performance.""Young Frankenstein"" was nearly the first movie I ever saw, early in 1975 when I was all of eight, and watching it again takes me back to that first feeling of wonder. You get this great classic horror build-up, enough to stir dread in the youngest hearts, and then you get bowled over with humor for ninety minutes. But the film never quite lets go of the scary stuff, which is why it endures. Indeed, the best scenes, like the one where the good Doctor has himself locked in a room with a monster, ordering his staff not to let him out, have a healthy dose of both. (`What's the matter with you people, couldn't you tell I was joking! Let me out! Mommy!')The DVD for this is especially worth having, with Brooks' commentary, a documentary with Wilder but not Brooks (are they never going to collaborate on anything ever again?), and nice little bonus features, like commercials with Brooks' clever voice-overs (""Some say this is the best movie ever made, and this is Some signing off"") and a pair of Spanish-language interviews shot for Mexican television which demonstrate both YF's international appeal and the good-natured, try-anything attitude of the cast as Wilder, Leachman, and Feldman obviously relish being interviewed in two languages at once. (Leachman even kisses the interviewer on the lips at the end of her segment; where can I get a job like his?) ""Young Frankenstein"" may be a film set entirely at night, but the sun was really shining on these guys all the same.",Young Frankenstein
79,caspian1978,A Phenomenon!,8,26 December 2004,"Like Jewison's Jesus Christ Superstar, Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein is another example of modern movie-making that translates comedy at its very best. Comparing the film to Citizen Kane, there is not a single frame not worth talking about. While the rest of the world will scream about the Producers as Mel Brooks legacy, Young Frankenstein is just as good if not better. The cast of characters which includes the late / great Madeline Kahn add to the movie's genius. A perfect movie for all, this is a comedy worth laughing with. It is very hard for a horror movie to be both scary at times and funny all of the time. Young Frankenstein is a marvel of a movie and a great comedy wrapped up into one.",Young Frankenstein
80,justin-fencsak,One of two classic Mel Brooks movies released the same year..1974.,10,24 March 2020,It's well done and has been a mainstay of TV airings ever since then. This movie has even spawned an upcoming live version of the film scheduled for release this year.,Young Frankenstein
81,Sandcooler,Slow yet pretty enjoyable,7,9 April 2010,"When compared to Mel Brooks' earlier works, ""The Producers"" to name one, this movie strikes me as pretty conventional. It's about what you'd expect a Frankenstein parody to be like, but there's little else to say about it. I don't know what exactly I was expecting, but the movie feels like it misses a true edge. It doesn't really have a new ""Springtime For Hitler"", let alone a new well, pretty much every scene from ""Blazing Saddles"". Apart from the tedious first fifteen minutes, it's not at all bad though. Gene Wilder is always brilliant, but especially Marty Feldman as Igor (or is it Aye-Gor?) steals every scene he's in. It's just a shame that the material isn't a bit more clever, as most of the jokes are obvious and predictable. Oh well, we'll always have the monster's dance scene.",Young Frankenstein
82,brando647,YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is Mel Brooks' Comedy Masterpiece,8,12 February 2017,"YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN was another Mel Brooks classic I had somehow gone without seeing for most of my life. I have friends that were befuddled at how I had avoided watching it for so long and seemed to have a vested interest in correcting it. They can all rest easy now. I've seen it a few times thanks to the nine-film Brooks collection I bought. YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, considered one of Mel Brooks' best films, was released in the same year as BLAZING SADDLES. Suffice it to say, 1974 was probably the greatest year in Mel Brooks' long, successful career. Despite the heaps of praise the movie has received from critics and audiences, I wasn't as impressed the first time. I was expecting more of Brooks' zanier comedic styling in line with BLAZING SADDLES and SPACEBALLS, but this was a lower key, less ""in you face"" Brooks comedy. It wasn't until the second (and ongoing) viewings that it really clicked with me. I watched it for what it was as opposed to what I expected it to be, and now I get what all the hype was about. YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN shines in the performances and the love of the screenwriters (Brooks and star Gene Wilder) for the source material at which they're lovingly poking fun. Watching it for the more slapstick and pop culture gags I'd come to expect from stuff like SPACEBALLS and ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS, I'd overlooked all the best material from the amazing cast and sharp writing.YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN presents itself as a sort of sequel to the classic Universal horror films directed by James Whale in the early 1930's. Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Wilder) is living in America as a successful professor and neurosurgeon when he receives word of his grandfather's death from his family estate in Transylvania. Frankenstein has no intention in his following in his grandfather's insane footsteps as the man infamous for experiments in resurrecting the dead. But I suppose it'd be hard for anyone to turn down a free castle in Europe. Frankenstein arrives in Transylvania where he meets Igor (Marty Feldman), Inga (Teri Garr), and Frau Blücher (Cloris Leachman). Frankenstein quickly discovers his grandfather's old laboratory in the bowels of the estate with instructions on how he successfully reanimated dead tissue. The draw becomes too much for Frankenstein and he embarks on his own experiment in bringing the dead back to life, creating his own monster (Peter Boyle) that wreaks its own brand of hilarious havoc on the Transylvanian countryside. Those familiar with Universal's Frankenstein films will find an abundance of love in this parody for the source material. I love that Wilder and Brooks went to the extreme in their love letter to the James Whale films: the choice to shoot the film in black and white, the recreation of the high contrast lighting style, the melodrama, and an iconic score from Brooks' frequent collaborator John Morris. YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN has reverence for source lacking in Brooks' others except maybe SILENT MOVIE.Gene Wilder's performance as the conflicted Frankenstein heir is one of his greatest that I've seen, right up there with his turn as Willy Wonka. Wilder gets to bounce between the extremes of melodramatic personal confliction and utter insanity, and no one does it better than him. This film was apparently a passion project of his and he approached Brooks about the idea early in the process of making BLAZING SADDLES so it makes sense that he'd give it his best. This film was also my introduction to Marty Feldman, a man whose face was iconic to me as Igor long before I ever even saw this film. He's always been the first face to pop to mind with the character despite only ever having seen glimpses of him on the poster or in short clips. I love his performance here more than anything else in the movie. He's got impeccable comedic timing and a knack for physical humor (I learned later through SILENT MOVIE that he was a huge fan of Buster Keaton). I could spend an entire viewing of this movie just focusing on his performance because, even when the focus isn't on his character, he's reacting hilariously in the background. I also want to bring attention to my other favorite character in the film, that of Inspector Kemp as played by Kenneth Mars. Apparently his character is based on one from the later Frankenstein films that I'm not as familiar with; he's head of the local police force and he's got one wooden arm from previous dealings with a past Frankenstein monster. Kemp's a big physical performance with plenty of laughs coming from his stiff wooden arm but I also love that his Germanic accent becomes more indecipherable the more riled up he becomes.And those were just the performances that stood out to me. Everyone in this cast is a comedic genius and it's no surprise that many of them would collaborate with Brooks on other occasions. Brooks knows comedy and he's combined that here with a shared love of the old Universal horror films that inspired him (and Wilder). As with many of Brooks' other films, this one is considered a classic with dialogue quoted everywhere and homages scattered throughout pop culture. YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is one of those films I find difficult to explain what I adore about it, but would instead be more comfortable watching with friends and sharing in the laughs with others. This, with BLAZING SADDLES, marks the epitome of Brooks' collection of comedies and I imagine the love for the film will continue indefinitely as new generations are introduced.",Young Frankenstein
83,Gislef,Brooks at his height,9,2 February 2001,"Young Frankenstein is more polished than its predecessors (except maybe Producers), and funnier than its successors. Part of it may be the focus: while Blazing Saddles lampoons Westerns in general, Young Frankenstein sticks to just one (or two) specific movies: Frankenstein and Bride of... (and they're really so closely related they might as well be one long movie) Only in Spaceballs does he really ever target a specific movie, and even then Brooks's all over the map. YF simply parodies one movie: it would be less funnier if Brooks had tossed in Dracula and Mummy jokes (as he tosses Alien and Planet of the Ape jokes into Spaceballs, and Godfather jokes into Men in Tights).Everybody in the cast is hilarious, the dialogue and physical comedy is great, and some of the scenes are...well, realistic. Brooks doesn't just lampoon, say, the hidden-bookshelf gag, but demonstrates what would probably happen if someone actually tried to get through one.  Still, there's plenty of non-sequiter humor (why _does_ Igor's hunch keep shifting? Who cares?).Overall, highly recommended.",Young Frankenstein
84,mhorg2018,A fine take on the classic film,8,17 August 2018,"While I still consider Blazing Saddles to be funnier, this is a damn funny movie. The cast is simply great and while some jokes fall flat, the look and timing of the rest carries this to heights of hilarity. Just a really funny movie that holds up to successive viewings.",Young Frankenstein
85,sme_no_densetsu,"To quote Homer Simpson, ""Scared the hell out of me!""",8,19 January 2009,"""Young Frankenstein"" is one of Mel Brooks's most fondly remembered films. It is an affectionate parody of the Universal 'Frankenstein' movies of the 1930's, which were based on Mary Shelley's classic novel. In this case, Gene Wilder portrays a descendant of the infamous Frankenstein who ends up resuming his grandfather's work with hilarious results.One of the most appealing things about this film is the look, which closely imitates the original films. The film is shot in black and white and many of the editing transitions and directorial choices recall an earlier style. Also enforcing the 1930's atmosphere is the score by John Morris.Bringing the story to life is an enviable cast of comedic talents. Gene Wilder does a fine job in the lead role and is given strong support from the likes of Cloris Leachman, Marty Feldman and Madeline Kahn.The script's sense of humour is mostly understated though there are moments of unbridled hilarity. There are a few jokes that don't quite connect with me but they are far outnumbered by the ones that do. If you haven't seen any of the old Universal movies, don't worry since the humour doesn't hinge on an extensive knowledge of the source material.In my opinion, this film ranks alongside ""Blazing Saddles"" & ""The Producers"" as some of Brooks's best work, not to mention some of the best comedies in American film. I recommend it regardless of whether or not you've seen any of the original Frankenstein films.",Young Frankenstein
86,Screen_Blitz,"A goofy, but clever parody of the classic old story of Frankenstein",7,7 September 2016,"By today, it's highly today that nearly film buff around the world has grown familiar to the story of Victor Von Frankenstein, the eccentric scientist who made a desperate attempt to prove the world he was not a lunatic when he snatched up a corpse from its grave and re- animated it into the live human being. Whether you've seen the cinematic adaption in 1941 or read the classic novel, there is no denying the massive influence its left on the world of literacy as well as the horror genre. This comedy-horror spoof directed by Mel Brookswho many call the ""king of the parody genre"" and written by Gene Wilder (along with Mel Brooks himself) takes Mary Shelley's classic story and feeds it with parody treatment filled with goofy slapstick humor and belly laughs that though feel a bit outdated by today's standards considering the four decades of age, but are still somewhat funny. The film follows the tale of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (played by Gene Wilder), a neurosurgeon and grandson of the famous Victor Von Frankenstein. Unlike the public who admires the his famous work, Frederick refuses to acknowledge the legacy of his late grandfather's and considers him a ""creep"". He goes as far as to altering the pronunciation of his surname. This is until he is invited to the old castle in Transylvania where his grandfather once worked. There, he meets old housekeeper Frau Blucher (played by Cloris Leachman), bobbled-eyed hunchback Igor (played by Marty Feldman), and young mistress Elizabeth (played by Madeline Kahn). Together, they make a discovery in the old basement of Frankenstein's old experiment that leads Fredrick to believe his grandfather wasn't so crazy after all.Upon watching this, the primary question that elevated in my head was ""has the movie aged well?"". By today's standards, many can agree that this is a comedy that didn't quite age too well. But considering the clever, if goofy slapstick humor generates by the highly popular Mel Brooks, the man responsible for a smorgasbord of spoof comedies in the 70s and 80s including 'Blazing Saddles', History of The World' and 'Spaceballs', this movie surprisingly manages to remain funny and charming in almost every way; but perhaps with less nuance. Sure, some of the humor does derive the corny terroritory even for it's time, but it is not say Mel Brooks drives the flick into a comedic wasteland. As this campy horror-comedy spoofs the classic horror story, it elicits more laughs than scares, generating some zany characters and eccentric slapstick gags that feel more outdated than the film itself. But the biggest surprise here is Gene Wilder does a good job with making them just enough to please at least a significant crowd of people who are able to tune in on retro-style humor. Gene Wilder, following his charming on the classic children's movie 'Willy Wonka and The Chocalate Factory' gives an eccentric performance as the titular character with his zany one-liners and comedic persona. His co- stars Madeline Kahn, Marth Feldman, and Cloris Leachman also given their time to shine here, and the comedic chemistry they share together along with Gene Wilder is nice in some degree, but doesn't quite hold up. Then, there is Peter Boyle as the creepy old monster brought back to alive also manages to spit a few surprising laughs here and there, nothing special but nothing too dull either.Young Frankenstein may have aged well in terms of narrative and humor, but it still has it's clever moments including some smart laughs that still hold up today, except for those who may not find zany humor their cup of tea. Nonetheless, this is a clever spoof comedy that is worth examining in honor of Gene Wilder who made comedic gold during the 70s and 80s.",Young Frankenstein
87,KUAlum26,Watched it again for the first time!,8,14 January 2007,"As mentioned in my comments on Blazing Saddles, Mel Brooks' comedy seems to be somewhat dated and lacking the speed,zing or feral grossness that today's comedy-viewing crowd are probably used to,but that shouldn't take away the value of his movies,which have a loony sense of physical comedy and a spry sense of the ribald. I think you can be of ANY age and appreciate a movie like that.Filmed very intentionally in black-and-white and in the slow,dissolving fashion that characterized the James Whale Frankenstein movies of the thirties,the story follows Professor Frederick Frankenstein(Gene Wilder,co-writer of the film,using his more trademark manic explosiveness here),who insists on having his name FRONK-un-SHTEEN and bristles at the association with his famous grandfather,Victor Frankenstein. Upon learning that he has inherited the castle and laboratory that belonged to his Grandfather,he travels to visit it in the old country. He meets the grandson of the original henchman,Igor,pronounced EYE-gor(Marty Feldman,all bug-eyed,hunchbacked and gamest for the folly of anyone here it seems) and becomes close with the lovely townsfraulein INga(the always fetching Teri GArr). He quickly becomes obsessed with his grandfather's work,much to the delight of his grandfather's stern housekeeper Frau Blucher(Cloris Leachman),who had a hand in the work and was had a particular love interest in the late Herr Doktor. History is about to repeat itself,as the third generation Frankenstein also creates a massive hulk made out of hanged convicts(Peter Boyle,God rest his soul,who did more with no lines),who is also a powerfully strong creation who inspires fear and anger from the already suspicious locals.My comment summary refers to the fact that I've probably seen this movie AT LEAST four times before,and first recall sitting fully through it on a NBC late summer broadcast on a Friday night in August or September,1983. I recall being very tickled by the sight-gags,verbal plays and pratfalls back then,and upon watching it very recently STILL laughing out loud at the same gags. Perhpas I was in the mood or mindset to laugh at the comic devises this time as opposed to some of the times of watched this between then and now. Whatever,all I know is that this film has an organic sense of comedy that is probably all but lost now,which is somewhat of a shame. While Mr.Brooks' work may never quite be what it used to be,the work that was IS STILL brilliant and worth adding to one's film library,particularly for those who miss older,lighter fare that has a true appreciation for film styles and genres.",Young Frankenstein
88,MadamWarden,MONSTROUS FUN,10,21 August 2020,What a classic!?!?! I can't believe that I still laughed out loud at the old gags. Soooo bad yet so hilarious. The cast obviously had an absolute blast making this romp.Seen it a few times over the years but still love it.A must watch!!😂,Young Frankenstein
89,mattymatt4ever,"Not Mel Brooks' best; a bit of a disappointment, though there are some very funny moments",6,29 June 2001,"Maybe I'm just a little spoiled.  I watch a Mel Brooks movie and expect to laugh nonstop.  From the beginning to end, I try to brace myself for his magic punchlines.  I laughed intermittently during ""Young Frankenstein."" There are, undoubtedly, some very funny moments.  I enjoyed the bit about the secret door with Gene Wilder and Teri Garr, the little girl flying off the see-saw and the blind-man sketch with Gene Hackman (who I didn't notice until I saw his name in the end credits).  But I really, really expected to laugh more.  Like always, Mel Brooks assembles a multi-talented group of performers (even if he makes a flop, he never fails to hire terrific actors) like Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman and Teri Garr (who looked beautiful back then).  And of course, we have Peter Boyle as The Monster.  Boyle is an underrated actor who still hasn't become a household name.  I really wish Brooks could've made his character funnier, so he could've had more to work with.  He's turned in fine comic performances (watch his performance as a Bible-toting schitzophrenic in ""The Dream Team"") and I'm sure he could've done something great with the role.Some people dispute Brooks' more recent works like ""Robin Hood:  Men in Tights"" and ""Spaceballs,"" when in fact I think those are some of his best films.  I guess people just love saying, ""Mel's lost his edge.""  I think his edge got sharper as the years went by.  I haven't seen ""Blazing Saddles"" in a long time (the last time I saw it I was about 8 years old, so I didn't fully understand the humor), so I can't fully judge if ALL his old movies weren't up to par.  I felt ""The Producers"" was just plain awful and ""Young Frankenstein"" is not bad, but inconsistent and overall...an OK movie. However, I'm still a big fan of Mel Brooks, I still feel he's one of our greatest comedy writers/directors, and even greats can screw up at times. I've seen almost all his movies, and with the exception of the two just mentioned and ""Dracula:  Dead and Loving It"" Mel has never let me down. 
Looking at this comedy, I just couldn't help but ponder ""There's a lot more that could've been done here.""  I'm not sure what--I'm no comic genius--but I just saw quite a bit of unused potential.I would much better recommend ""History of the World:  Part 1"" or ""Robin Hood:  Men in Tights,"" if you're looking for a good Mel Brooks comedy.  As I said, it had its moments, but I would not closely regard it as one of the funniest movies of all time.  My score:  6 (out of 10)",Young Frankenstein
90,sharky_55,"No, it's pronounced Fronkensteen.",9,23 August 2016,"Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein is an ode to classic horror, although if you have read the original novel by Mary Shelley you would know that it was not just simply a scary story. The first Frankenstein's monster was an intelligent, sensitive and misunderstood creature, and the most frightening thing was not its appearance but the arrogance and hubris of its creator. Over time this has become somewhat diluted; pop culture is familiar with the screws in its head, but the mind behind it. So although modern Frankenstein monsters are more grotesque and misshapen than ever, they are often merely props for the sake of Victor's story-line. All the characters in the film know this, as does Mel Brooks, who also knows the audience expectations to a tee. This is the most crucial bit of information when you are creating a parody. The setting and its inhabitants are ripe with self-awareness. They pepper the grandson of the infamous Frankenstein, who insists that it is pronounced differently. Gene Wilder has never been more suitable. He plays his trademark shouty, exasperated indignation against the expectations of the crowd and the audience, as though he is wanting to break from the plot- line itself. But his eccentric expressions betray his own awareness of the age-old story, and his knowledge of his inevitable doom. The more he denounces his grandfather the more he marks himself for downfall. We are all in on the joke, so it is funny how desperate Wilder tries to escape his fate. He is a good enough actor to hint at this absurdity, but also to seem at least a little bit serious. Meanwhile, the more they speak of the unspeakable things that happened in the same town decades ago, the more ridiculous spooky horror superlatives are added; his name is now Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein.Brooks establishes the conventional world with the usual touches, and pokes fun at little details that we never seem to question, which is the quintessential concern with parody. The setting is of course a hilltop castle, dripping with Gothic atmosphere, candles flickering in the torrent rain and wolves howling from the forests. The horses rear up and neigh in fright, as expected, but Brooks programmes them to do so not because of the atmosphere and perceived threat, but because they have been conditioned to so do at the mention of a name like a carnivale contraption. Now, if only Brooks could also harness the dramatic lightning to do so. The camera hovers sensually over the coffin, building anticipation of the unspoken horrors within, but the hands which snatch them find that the corpse still has that little bit of resolve to prevent its robbing. Brooks humorously demolishes horror tropes left and right. The most delightful extended gag involves one of those hidden revolving doors where ""There's always a trigger!"". And in movies, they always seem to spin around effortlessly and in perfectly measured degrees for the protagonists. This one is not so allowing, not so precise. The genius of the film is how steady it is initially, the dark and twisted scenarios we all know, the indignant Frederick denying any chance of going down the same path as his grandfather, his intellect and common sense when the experiment fails. Any normal character would take this as a sign that some dark arts are better off untouched. And yet Brooks slowly starts his descent into the madness and absurdity of the whole thing, where morality and caution are tossed aside for the sake of the crazed scientist's aspirations. He builds from the ground up, subverting the classics. Wilder takes the first failure with ""quiet dignity and grace"", but we know that his trademark explosion is coming, so it is all the more hilarious when it does.",Young Frankenstein
91,Beta_Gallinger,"Many memorably funny moments in this spoof, with great acting and black-and-white cinematography to top it off!",10,22 December 2009,"In a time when the spoof movie genre has become a disease with the infamous Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, I'm sure many concerned people can really appreciate classic spoofs like this! Directed by renowned comedy filmmaker Mel Brooks, with a screenplay co-written by Brooks and Gene Wilder, 1974's ""Young Frankenstein"" is a spoof/homage to the Universal horror movies of the 1930's, specifically the ""Frankenstein"" ones. The movie was an absolute success, and is clearly still very popular 35 years later. It was released over a decade before I was born, but in recent years, I've learned about Brooks and several of his films. Knowing this was one of the films he is best known for, I decided to watch it this month, and it certainly wasn't what I could call unfunny or forgettable! Dr. Frederick Frankenstein is a teaching neurosurgeon and the grandson of Victor Frankenstein, who was famous for reanimating corpses. However, Frederick is so ashamed of his grandfather's work that he does not wish to be associated with him, and has even changed the pronunciation of his surname. One day, a solicitor comes to the neurosurgeon's classroom, and after the class is dismissed, Frankenstein is informed that he has inherited his family estate, a castle in Transylvania! After bidding farewell to his fiancée, Elizabeth, Frankenstein travels to Transylvania, where he soon meets Igor, his new hunchbacked servant. The doctor then meets Inga, who will be his new lab assistant, and Frau Blücher, another servant. During his first night in the castle, he hears mysterious violin music, and searches with Igor and Inga to find out exactly where it's coming from! During their search, Frederick discovers Victor Frankenstein's secret library and reads his journals, which suddenly changes his thoughts on reanimation! He is now determined to follow in his grandfather's footsteps and reanimate a dead body, with the assistance of Inga and Igor, but unfortunately, this is bound to lead to trouble, just like it did for Victor! There were many times I laughed while watching this film, sometimes hard and sometimes lightly. There are some comic highlights during the classroom scene around the beginning, including Frankenstein's demonstration to the class, and especially his reaction to a student's questions about his grandfather! After that, there's the farewell scene at the train station, another comic highlight, and many more follow that one. These include the part where Dr. Frankenstein and Igor first meet (with several pronunciation jokes), the doctor and Inga trying to get through the revolving bookcase, Igor startling Frankenstein and Inga after they look at the dead skulls, and so many more, some of which I would probably be giving away too much of the story if I mentioned! Not ALL the gags are hilarious, but a good number of them are. Unlike some people, I couldn't give this a 10/10 just for the humour. Gene Wilder puts on an outstanding performance as Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, and Marty Feldman (Igor), Cloris Leachman (Frau Blücher), Teri Garr (Inga), Madeline Kahn (Elizabeth), Peter Boyle (The Monster), etc. are all memorable as well. Filmed in black and white, the movie also has nice cinematography, and does a great job capturing the atmosphere of the 30's horror movies! Finally, the script was well written, and as well as the humour, there's also suspense.Some viewers might say this horror spoof is hilarious from start to finish, maybe even the funniest movie of all time. I definitely can't say I agree with these statements, but I still laughed so many times, and the humour isn't all ""Young Frankenstein"" has to offer. Everything else I've mentioned about the film also helps make it what it is. It was released 35 years ago and is still popular today, so I probably haven't said anything about it that it hasn't already been praised for, and probably can't! For those who are disgusted by how low Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have sunk the spoof genre lately, then you could find that watching a spoof movie like this, from a different era, to be somewhat of a relief! Of course, I haven't seen EVERY spoof movie from recent years, and I'm sure there are good ones I've yet to see, but I know some of the ones from the past decade or so have been lame, especially if they were made by Friedberg and Seltzer! If you're a fan of classic horror movies from the 30's and have the right sense of humour to be amused by this 1974 Mel Brooks comedy, I would say you're bound to find a lot to like!",Young Frankenstein
92,one9eighty,A genre bending tongue in cheek romp with style,8,31 January 2019,"A classic Mel Brooks film, easily one of his best, produced in 1974 - the same year as his other classic, ""Blazing Saddles"". While Brooks takes the directing credit, the film script was written in partnership between Brooks and Gene Wilder, who took the starring role in the film as Frederick Frankenstein. More than just writing and starring in it, Wilder was the driving force behind this film being created, while ""Blazing Saddles"" was Brooks pet project, this was Wilder's.As well as Wilder, you'll find a fine cast including Madeline Kahn, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr, Kenneth Mars and Marty Feldman - oh, and keep an eye out for Gene Hackman who makes a brief cameo.The film is a retelling of the Mary Shelly ""Frankenstein"" story, with a comedic twist for good measures. Expect the find visual and audible gags galore in the film - if you are a fan of Mel Brooks films or comedy in general then you really won't be disappointed here. A lot of effort went into the production values of the film, from the fantastic set and props, to it intentionally being filmed in black and white. It's fair to say, that as well as the fine casting, writing, timing/ pace, acting and mise-en-scene in general - one of the biggest strengths of the movie is that it is timeless - it's as fun and entertaining today in 2019, as it was in 1974. Not many films can say that - and certainly not many spoof/comedy films have the honour of saying that. I watched this with my father as a young child and loved it; re-watching it with my girlfriend who had never seen it, I still bloody loved it.My rating for this is 8 out of 10 - you really can't go wrong with this, it's a treat to the senses and a brilliant film. It's been 45 years since it was released, and I can honestly see this film being as good in another 45 years.",Young Frankenstein
93,jhclues,Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder Deliver A Classic Parody,10,30 July 2001,"Ever wonder about what might have happened to the journals kept by the infamous Dr. Frankenstein, or the notes he must have made while conducting his ill-advised experiments, attempting to reanimate dead tissue?  And what of his descendants?  How would his legacy of horror have affected them a few generations down the line?  Well, ponder no more, because these questions and many more are finally answered forevermore in `Young Frankenstein,' an hilarious parody directed by Mel Brooks.  Dr. Frankenstein's great-grandson, Frederick (Gene Wilder), is a doctor and teacher whose research has gained him some renown in his own right, and he has done his best to disassociate himself with the tarnished reputation of his ancestor (he even pronounces his name `Fronk-en-Steen').  Then one day he is notified that he has inherited his great-grandfather's estate, including the castle, in which the elder doctor's laboratory has been preserved.  Frederick, of course, must go to Transylvania to settle his affairs; but the whole affair soon becomes unsettled when Frederick discovers that it is impossible to escape his destiny.  And once he arrives, the die is cast and there is just no turning back, as he can no longer deny that his... name... is... FRANKENSTEIN!	On his own, Mel Brooks is usually good, even great, but when he teams up with Gene Wilder it becomes something extra-special, which first became apparent with `The Producers,' in 1967.  But the directness with which Brooks approaches this material, combined with Wilder's understated performance makes this their all-time best.  They co-wrote the screenplay, and with their differing perspectives of comedy they managed to capture the best of both worlds and strike a balance that works to perfection here. Brooks hits you over the head and gets right in your face with a gag, but Wilder steps aside, grabs it by the tail and hits the pause button (so-to-speak), just long enough to really put the joke across.  Together they're like the ying and yang of the comedic universe.  The screenplay is clever and includes all of the elements that successfully evoke the essence of the old B&W horror films that are such a part of cinematic lore today. What they give you with this film is the Frankenstein story with contemporary sensibilities, while presenting a cast of characters that take it over the top.	As far as the performances go, nobody, but nobody could have played Frederick better than Gene Wilder.  He employs that prolonged, meaningful pause of his (nobody does it better), which he usually accentuates with a slight shifting of the eyes-- just before he delivers a line-- that can make even a mediocre line hilarious.  His subtle approach and staid countenance play this material perfectly, and complimented by Brooks' straight ahead direction it allows the humor to flow naturally and freely and never fails to get the right kind of laugh at just the right time.  The way they capture the sense of the original `Frankenstein' (and the many sequels) is uncanny, from the overall look of the film to the reactions by everyone at the mere mention of the monster, to the throng of anxious villagers led by the unfaltering and inarticulate Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars).	Besides Wilder, who is clearly the star of the show, the supporting performances turned in by this superlative ensemble cast are absolutely impeccable, beginning with Peter Boyle as the monster.  Boyle has the gait and the growl down pat, but also conveys so much with his expressions and introspective comportment.  Then there is Marty Feldman as Igor (that's `EYE-gore'), whose bug-eyed portrayal of the little hunchback who refuses to acknowledge his hump (mainly because he doesn't realize he actually has one) is hilarious.  Teri Garr is a joy to behold as Inga, Frederick's lab assistant, and Cloris Leachman practically steals the show as Frau Blucher (and don't say her name within earshot of the horses).  Mars also creates a memorable character by putting a mumble and a wooden arm to especially riotous use, and last but not least is the wonderful Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth, Frederick's intended who ultimately finds something grand to sing about.  	Also included in the supporting cast are Richard Haydn (Herr Falkstein), Liam Dunn (Mr. Hilltop), Danny Goldman (in a memorable bit as a medical student who challenges Frederick during a lab demonstration), Anne Beesley (Little Girl), Michael Fox (Villager) and Gene Hackman in an uproarious cameo as Harold, the Blind Man.  Often a parody of this nature wears thin after awhile, and even the best rarely manages to maintain a level of excellence for even thirty or forty minutes, let alone for 105 minutes as this one does.  And without question, `Young Frankenstein' delivers on a level to which few films of this nature can even aspire.  Arguably one of Mel Brooks' best-- if not THE best he's ever done-- and with a definitive performance by Gene Wilder, this parody takes a place among the all time greats in the history of the cinema.  It's funny stuff that gets funnier every time you see it, and that's the true magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",Young Frankenstein
94,SanteeFats,Excellent,10,27 July 2013,"This movie is just so funny I couldn't stop laughing. This might be Mel Brook's funniest movie including Blazing Saddles, which was super funny in it's own right. Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, and Teri Garr are just fantastic in this movie. Teri Garr is the sexiest I have ever seen her, including the movie where she showed skin.The outset of the movie has Gene refusing his heritage as a Frankenstein. He eventually goes to his ancestral castle and Cloris Leachman, the house keeper and old Frankentein's lover as it turns out, lures him to the old laboratory used by his ancestor. He goes through the usual procedures and creates a monster (?) played very well by Peter Boyd (RIP). Kenneth Mars plays an excellent inspector Kemp and I love his fake hand. The ending where Gene and Peter swap some of their brains and, as it turns out body parts is just too funny. I like Madelaine Kahn is good as the uptight I want it my way until she hooks up with the monster is a nice touch.",Young Frankenstein
95,rupie,sure to become a classic,7,20 May 1999,"The conventional wisdom for once is correct. This is one of the greatest comedies ever made, by one of the greatest comedians, Mel Brooks. Wilder, Boyle, Leachman, Feldman and Kahn are at the top of their form here. Hackman's cameo as the blind man has got to be one the funniest five minutes in film (""now don't inhale until the tip glows!""). The parody of the Frankenstein genre is perfect. Anyone who has not seen this gem is living a deprived life.Frau Blucher!!!!",Young Frankenstein
96,KnightsofNi11,This is what screwball is all about,8,7 July 2011,"The king of spoof, Mel Brooks, proved his title with one of his most renowned films of all time, Young Frankenstein. Gene Wilder stars as Dr. Frederich Frankenstein, the grandson of the infamous Baron Von Frankenstein who created his monster which terrorized villagers years before. When Frederich inherits his grandfather's castle he stumbles upon the baron's work and sets out to create his own monster in the name of science. This film is what screwball comedy is all about. It is a uproariously hilarious ride that delivers one hilariously quotable line after the next.There is a right way and a wrong way to do screwball comedy. Mel Brooks knows the right way and he hits it right on the nose with Young Frankenstein. The absurdity and silliness of this film never feels out of place and it always fits just right with the pacing of the film. This is a very goofy and off the wall kind of film but there's something about it that is just so damn funny. I would have to say it starts with the eccentric cast of characters all played to perfection by their actors. Gene Wilder plays up the mad scientist cliché just enough to where it becomes a joke in and of itself, spoofing the mad scientist stereotype just right. Marty Feldman plays Igor in what is possibly the most hilarious role in the entire film. From hitting on Frankenstein's fiancée to having his hump switch shoulders constantly everything he says and does makes me laugh.The two female leads are also hysterical. Madeline Kahn is so incredibly over the top, yet a lot of her humor is subtle, at least as subtle as any screwball humor gets. Teri Garr plays Inga, who has the most ridiculous German accent, making every last thing she says a joke. Cloris Leachman even has a small role as Frau Blucher, a role that is almost more creepy than it is funny. Then of course Peter Boyle plays the monster in a Frankenstein performance to rival Boris Karloff. It's the nuttiest portrayal of the creature ever but his scenes are some of the funniest of the entire film. The absence of Mel Brooks as a character in the film was a little disappointing but there's nothing to be done about that.You have to go into Young Frankenstein with a very open mindset because it is incredibly nonsensical and ridiculous, just like any great screwball comedy. If you waste time questioning the logic of this film one, you will make an idiot out of yourself, and two, you won't be able to enjoy the film nearly as much. This is one of the silliest films ever made, as is to be expected from Mel Brooks, but it is incredibly fun and you won't see a spoof pulled off nearly as well as this in a long, long time.",Young Frankenstein
97,Hollywood_Yoda,"Young Frankenstein, Standing the Test of Time",9,14 September 2012,"This is a Mel Brooks classic from start to finish. If you don't laugh at this film within the first five minutes, there's something wrong! Gene Wilder stars as Dr. Frankenstein, the wildly and crazy man who creates the Monster. Peter Boyle stars as that monster, in his most famous role outside of ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" The film also stars Madeline Kahn (a Mel Brooks regular), Kenneth Mars and Cloris Leachman.When I was first introduced to this film and ""Blazing Saddles"" many years ago, I thought it would be just another zany comedy, but it wasn't. This film, like Brooks' other films of the time has heart and a story. After watching it for a few minutes, it became interesting, most notably the dart playing scene with Inspector Kemp and Dr. Frankenstein play.It may be in black and white, unlike most films of its era, but it stands out amongst the crowd of films as a sure crowd pleaser. Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder's comedy were genius in this 1974 classic. A movie you sure don't want to miss out on.",Young Frankenstein
98,krorie,Ah! Sweet mystery of life at last I've found you,10,6 March 2006,"It is difficult to determine which is funnier ""Young Frankenstein"" or ""Blazing Saddles."" Both sprang perhaps full blown from the demented brain of Mel Brooks. The two also represent the apex of his creative genius. He had already done such gems as ""Your Show of Shows"" and ""The Producers,"" not to mention ""Get Smart"" and ""The 2000 Year Old Man."" Following these two masterpieces, ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Blazing Saddles,"" his humor began to dry up and become even trite. Perhaps fame and fortune was too much for him. He still had a little of the spark left for ""Silent Movie"" and ""Spaceballs."" Then oblivion. Too bad. We miss the old mad Mel.""Young Frankenstein"" is basically a clever spoof of the old Universal horror flicks of the 30's and 40's, in particular ""The Bride of Frankenstein,"" which itself was somewhat of a spoof on the entire genre. Mel had the good sense to shoot it in crisp black and white using sets that resemble the sets in the originals, making the film seem all that more quaint and relevant. He also assembled his cast of idiots, the funniest buffoons on the planet earth at the time, or is it Mars? Who can forget Madeline Kahn's first sexual encounter with the monster? Kahn, who has to be one of the greatest comediennes in screen history, calls Frankenstein's monster by her pet name for him, ""Zipper Neck."" Once consummated Kahn lets out one of the wildest soprano screeches ever heard, ""Ah! Sweet mystery of life at last I've found you."" Gene Wilder is the only actor capable of playing Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (that's Frankensteen) with a flippancy so exaggerated that it comes off comical. Igor (that's I-Gor), the deformed dwarf who is in hump denial, is played in a grotesquely burlesque manner that is both repulsive and humorous by that crazy man Marty Feldman. Cloris Leachman is so creepy she would make any horse whinny and who wouldn't want a tumble in the hay with Teri Garr? So much as been written about the marvelous scene with the blind man played by the consummate actor Gene Hackman that one need only say, don't miss it. It is an outrageous parody of a similar scene in ""The Bride of Frankenstein,"" where the blind hermit is portrayed by O.P. Heggie. Then there's the monster, given a caricature interpretation by Peter Boyle. While not as ghoulish as Boris Karloff (who is?), he is just right for the comic touches required for the part.If for some unknown reason you haven't seen ""Young Frankenstein"" yet, by all means ignore the reviews and rent it on DVD or watch it on TV. You'll laugh till you're sore. This is one of those rare films that can stand repeat viewings and remain fresh and alive.",Young Frankenstein

100,bankofmarquis,My Favorite Comedy of All Time,10,20 April 2020,"There are certain films that I can revisit time and time again and the effects of the film do not diminish for me and I would argue that they get better with age...and with repeated viewings.Such is the case with Mel Brooks' Universal Horror film spoof/satire YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN from 1974. It is a work of comedic genius and features some of the most memorable characters in motion picture comedy history.Co-Writen by Brooks and Gene Wilder, Directed by Brooks and starring Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Teri Garr, Cloris Leachman and the great Madeline Kahn, this film sends up the black and white Universal Horror films of the 1930's not by making fun of them, but by lovingly recreating them and then exaggerating the scenes/circumstances.Wilder is at his manic best as Dr. Frederick Frankenstein - the grandson of the original Frankenstein - who is brought to Transylvania and soon takes up his grandfather's work. He works through a controlled rage throughout the film until such times where the rage (and his hair) comes bursting forth in maniacal energy that is a comic tour-de-force.He is surrounded by an outstanding collection of misfits, most notably Marty Feldman's servant/assistant Igor who is game for just about anything. Under-rated is the comedic performance of Teri Garr as Frankenstein's lab assistant Inga who not only has good looks (""what knockers"") but can hold her own with Wilder and Feldman in a scene. Peter Boyle is earnest and scary and vulnerable (all at the same time) in his portrayal of ""the Monster"" who just wants to be understood - the ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" scene shows some fine comedic chops in an actor that up to this point had not really done comedy (his Emmy nominated work in EVERYONE LOVES RAYMOND is years in the future).But it is the work of 2 female comediennes that drives this film to another level. Madeline Kahn as Frederick's fiance, Elizabeth, commands (and steals) every scene she is in while the inscrutable Cloris Leachman is deadpan perfection as castle housekeeper Frau Bleucher (horse whinny).Director Brooks keeps the jokes coming at a fast a furious pace, but keeps the pace and the story going as well. This is much more than ""just a collection of jokes"" - it is a very good movie.This film falls squarely in my ""Top 10 All Time Favorite Films"" - and my #1 comedy of all time.Letter Grade: A+10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Young Frankenstein
101,cchase,"""That's 'FRON-ken-STEEN'""...",10,5 December 2008,"After skewering the classic western and race relations in one politically incorrect and perfectly hysterical package, what would the director of BLAZING SADDLES do for an encore? Why, turn his twisted gaze to classic horror, of course...and the masterpiece written by Mary Shelley would never be the same!YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN took the original novel and the seminal James Whale vision of it produced by Universal, and made it do cartwheels, headstands and chorus-line kicks, literally. Not only does Brooks lovingly recreate nearly every set and every scene so accurately that film buffs can relate, but he and his able ensemble of nutcases give the whole affair that Brooksian spin that's part-Borscht Belt, part-Marx Brothers and all sublimely silly...even now, over THIRTY YEARS later!!! Besides SADDLES, it's the only other Brooks film that delivers consistent laughs every time...and in the same places!The Zucker-Abrams-Zucker team would take cues from his work about ten years later, and watching AIRPLANE! now, I can see where they got most of their inspiration.Gene Wilder is in the best form of his career as Dr. Victor ""FRON-ken-steen,"" the later-day descendant of the original ""monster-baiter"" himself. Serving up fantastic comic support are Marty Feldman as ""EYE-gor,"" his 'hump-y' lab assistant; the dearly-missed Madeline Kahn as his flighty floozy of a fiancée, Elizabeth and Teri Garr as the amply-endowed Inga, (""What knockers!"" ""Why, thank you, doctor!"") Rounding out the cast are Kenneth Mars as an Inspector only Clouseau would love, Gene Hackman in an uncredited appearance, who shows why he was the most logical choice to play Lex Luthor for laughs in the SUPERMAN franchise, and the unforgettable Cloris Leachman as the repressed-but-lascivious (and possibly bestiality-inclined) Frau Blucher.And for EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND fans who know nothing about Peter Boyle beyond that show, his Monster will prove to be a true revelation. A man who was usually cast as tough guys and worse? Who knew he had so much 'funny' in him? For someone who gets very few lines (until the classic ending), Boyle's comic timing and physicality are as important to the entire movie as Wilder's, if not more so.There isn't a lot of gore or nudity, but this is one horror comedy that really can be ""fun for the whole family."" And if it isn't already a permanent part of your movie library, shame on you!",Young Frankenstein
102,rainking_es,The Exception Proves The Rule,7,27 July 2004,"There're dozens of movies whose point is to make fun of previous Hollywood hits, and thre're three men which have dedicated the biggest part of their careers to manufacture that kind of devices: Jim Abrahams with his partner David Zucker, and Mel Brooks. Abrahams & Zucker directed Airplane!, Naked Gun series, Top Secret, Hot Shots... and Mr. Brooks made Spaceballs, Robin Hood, Dracula and, of course, this Young Frankenstein.
All those movies use to be second-rate because they depend so much on gags, and it is almost impossible to fill a whole movie with good gags every 2 or 3 minutes. But for me Airplane! is an exception, and Young Frankenstein it is too (for me YF is the best spoof-movie ever). Every single scene's got a good gag, and there're a lot of hilarious sequences. It's got a nice rhythm, and all the actors play their roles as good as they're supposed to: Gene Wilder (Mr. Fronkonstin!) gives us his best performance ever; Marty Feldman (aIgor) looks like a real freak (with that face you don't even need to be a real actor); and Peter Boyle (the Monster) proves that he's as good in comedy as he's in drama (you may remember him from Scorsese's Taxi Driver or Hardcore -Paul Schrader 70's-). There's no doubt that this is Mel Brooks' more remarkable and memorable movie (though I prefer Life Stinks, one of his few pictures that are not based on a previous one). Anyway, it does not matter is Brooks' filmography ain't that brilliant; because Young Frankenstein will remain as the exception that proves the rule that says ""spoof-movies are Retarded-Rated"". (Ok, It does not exist such rule, I've just made it; but I think that movies like Hot Shots or Robin Hood: Men In Tights are not to be watched by intelligent people).

Needless to say, he gets more than what he bargained for.There're several funny moments in this film that listing them would be daunting.

104,TheNorthernMonkee,"Wilder, Feldman, Brooks and Kahn. Bliss!",10,3 June 2004,"SPOILERSWhen Mel Brooks was preparing to release the wonderful ""Blazing Saddles"", he was set up working with his friend Gene Wilder on another piece of cinema. Wilder, for the last few months had been writing his latest idea, a satire of the classic Frankenstein films, and inviting Brooks to work with him, Wilder was to bring together an amazing group of people who would make ""Young Frankenstein"" the masterpiece that it is.In this film, Wilder plays young Frederick Frankenstein, a lecturer in neuroscience, who is given the last will and testament of his great grandfather. Travelling to Transylvania, Frederick finds himself with his own servant Igor (played beautifully by Marty Feldman) and it isn't long before he's creating his own monster too.Just like in ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""The Producers"", it is not just Mel Brooks, but his cast which makes the film so damn good. By including Marty Feldman and Madeline Kahn in this film, Wilder and Brooks have chosen two of my alltime favourite actors. Marty Feldman was a comic genius who is so often undervalued and who's early death was a tragedy for comedy. Likewise, Madeline's death in 1999 of Ovarian Cancer was also a comedic tragedy. All three of the main women in this film are wonderful in fact. Alongside Kahn, Teri Garr as Inga is hilarious and brilliant, even if often nowadays it is too easy for people to see her as Phoebe's mother from ""Friends"". Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher is the third main female star of this film, and whilst missing the sexual element which Kahn and Garr added, Leachman casts a twisted feature as her character, the original Dr Frankenstein's secret Girlfriend.Just like in the classic Boris Karloff films, it is the monster who is the most important character, and teaming up with Kahn, Wilder and company, as the monster was Peter Boyle. Boyle spending the majority of the film groaning is superb, adding a sense of child like naivety to the monster's existence.Aside from the beautiful combination of actors, with Mel Brooks behind the director, ""Young Frankenstein"" is a beautiful success. With the rare style of filming it in Black and White (the first time a film had been made in monotone for eight or nine years), the magic was complete.Ultimately, it can be very hard for me to write a review for Mel Brooks films. The reasoning behind this is that whilst I can easily condemn the later features, with the earlier films, I adore them all so much that it can be incredibly difficult to compare them with each other. With ""Young Frankenstein"" though I adore it so much that I have nothing but praise for it. If I had to choose one Mel Brooks film for a Brooks virgin, I'd choose ""Blazing Saddles"". In contrast if I wanted to choose the most clever and ingenius of his films, I confess I'd choose ""The Producers"". For my own personal choice though and for my pure love of so many of the cast characters, I would choose ""Young Frankenstein"" every day. This film is a piece of cinema history and something to be remembered.",Young Frankenstein
105,FilmOtaku,Mel Brooks' greatest film,9,2 December 2003,"Young Frankenstein is a bizarre film because it is a hilarious farce of classic horror films, but is presented to us with a beautiful cover.  The film is on part comedy classic and one part admirable film in an aesthetic sense.  The crisp black and white cinematography is really quite gorgeous.Co-written by Brooks and the film's star Gene Wilder, Young Frankenstein is (in this viewer's humble opinion) Brooks' greatest film to date.  Not only does it have some of the funniest lines of any film I've seen, (`What hump?') but showcases some of the most brilliant comedic acting seen in decades.  Gene Wilder, who has woefully all but disappeared from cinema the last two decades, is at his peak in this film.  His `Dr. Frankenstein' is at times both serious and completely spastic.  Teri Garr's `Inga' the lab assistant, is hilarious as a German sexpot.  Cloris Leachman's role as `Frau Blucher', the caretaker of Frankenstein's castle whose very name inspires the `whinnying' of horses is small, but incredibly memorable.  And Marty Feldman practically steals the show as `Igor', Dr. Frankenstein's henchman who has a wandering hump and a funny way of walking.  These characters are just a few examples of the outstanding cast who execute the brilliant lines in such a manner that thirty years later we are still repeating them and acting out various scenes.  There truly are not enough good things to say about Young Frankenstein, and certainly nothing that hasn't already been said.  If you have not seen this film, it is one of those films that one should see in their lifetime  not because it is an `important' or `socially relevant' film, but simply because it is a GREAT film.  --Shelly",Young Frankenstein

109,RonellSowes,Holds The Careful Balance Between Comedy And Stupidity,7,27 February 2021,"Dr Frederick Frankenstein(Wilder), who insists on pronouncing his name as Fronk-en-steen, returns to his ancestors home in Transylvania following the death of his great-grandfather Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein. The film, of course, is a spoof of the 1931 classic but also motion pictures from the era in general. It presents itself as a pseudo-old movie: being filmed in black & white and utilizing old fashioned techniques like wipes and iris out cuts. However, though it may ape films from the 30's or 40's it still has the style of humor of a film from 1974.
After Frederick alights the train he is greeted by his new assistant, an odd hunchback called Igor(Feldman)-pronounced I-gor. Due to his physical appearance, Marty Feldman couldn't play many roles however this one is clearly, perfect for him and he proves that with the best performance in the film. Some of the other inhabitants of the Frankenstein residence include Inga(Garr) and the stern Frau Blücher(Leachman), who's name has a mysterious effect on horses. After accidently discovering his grandfather's books and laboratory, Frederick along with the help of Igor and Inga resume the previous doctor's experiments. His experiment proves to be successful except for the fact that it has the brain of a mute idiot, due to a mistake that closely resembles that of the original monster. With the help of Frau Blücher, the monster(Boyle) manages to escape from the castle and into the countryside. Where it runs into a blind hermit(Gene Hackman) who proves to be quite dangerous to the lumbering hulk. Hackman was uncredited for his hardly recognizable but hilarious role in a brief scene that is definetly one of the film's high points. For the most part the humor in the film is mostly reliant on its ridiculous nature yet it doesn't fall into utter idiocy.
Regardless of whether or not you are a fan of the original Feankenstein or even familiar with it, you can still enjoy this film. Young Frankenstein manages to do what many comedies fail to; to walk that precarious line between comedy and stupidity and hold that balance for 106 minutes.",Young Frankenstein
110,Son_of_Mansfield,Old Friend.,10,23 October 2003,"I believe it was Gene Wilder who said that this was the perfect example of a perfect cast making everything come out right. Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Teri Garr, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman, and Gene Hackman in a small role all seem so perfect that they make up for some obvious and sub par jokes that are thankfully few and far between. I am thinking of when Igor tells Frederick to walk this way, the look on Gene Wilder's face makes up for the obvious joke. All of these actors are so perfect that I can't imagine anyone else in their parts. The touches made to make this movie look like one of the old Universal Frankenstein films(Peter Boyle's makeup, comic variations on classic scenes, and the brilliant choice to make the movie black and white) push this movie toward greatness. Add in a performance by Boyle that is worthy of Karloff and you can no longer avoid this film when speaking of classics. Like all classics it has flaws, but the good aspects make it forgivable, perhaps even more likable.*Until the day I die, I will continue to break out into this song at parties, ""I ain't got nobody and nobody cares for me!""*",Young Frankenstein

Then along comes Mel Brooks, King-- Nay, EMPEROR of the lampoon, Pope of satire and wit plenapotentiaire.  This film has it all.  Every moment that set those old films apart are recaptured. And, what a cast.  Not a weak spot in it.  Boyle is superb as the monster, Wilder is great as Frankenstein (-steen)..., and it goes on.  Everyone's good.  I've seen this film literally dozens of time but I saw it the first time on a flight to Uruguay in 1975.  I'd missed it before due to a hectic work schedule and howled from the moment the first scenes came on to the last.

Also it's a slap-stick comedy, and it works on all these levels! It pokes fun at every ridiculous Gothic cliché with a very inventive and various ways that still hold up to date. But it's the editing that stands out above the rest ways. Yes the editing! I can't remember if I've seen before a film editing that works this effectively in the comedy genre. It's so subtle and creative. Gene Wilder did it again with his charismatic and charming performance that must play a vital role in making the audience riveted whatever the movie he is in.Unfortunately, there are some jokes that didn't land. Mostly because they were repetitive. Although they worked at the first time, they lost their sharpness and effectiveness very quickly, maybe even at the second time they were repeated. The rest of the jokes that didn't hit the mark, which is quite few, were just because I didn't find them funny.I think Young Frankenstein is a very funny and unique comedy, and if I may choose between the two Mel Brooks films that have been released that year, Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles, I would choose Young Frankenstein.(8/10)",Young Frankenstein
113,FloatingOpera7,Mel Brooks Classic: Young Frankenstein,10,12 April 2007,"Young Frankenstein (1974): Gene Wilder, Peter Boyle, Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman, Cloris Leachman, Gene Hackman, Liam Dunn, Kenneth Mars, Richard Haydn, Danny Goldman, Anne Beesley, Arthur Malet, Oscar Bergegi Jr, Rick Norman, Rusty Blitz, Monte Landis, Rolfe Sedan, Johnny Dennis, Terence Pushman, Pat O'Hara, Richard A. Roth, Michael Fox, John Carradine, Ian Abercrombie, Berry Kroeger, Jeff Maxwell, Clement Von Franckenstein.....Director Mel Brooks, Screenplay Gene Wilder, Mel Brooks.From 1974, this is one of the earliest successes for comedian Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder, who teamed up for this hilarious and well-written comic parody/spoof of the beloved horror classic ""Frankenstein"". It's specifically parodying the 1931 Universal Picture starring Boris Karloff. Gene Wilder stars as Dr. Frederic Frankenstein, a mad scientist living in a castle in Germany, engaged to the beautiful but shallow Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn), carrying on an affair with his sexy assistant Inga (Teri Garr)and waited on hand and foot by his hunch-back man-servant Igor (Marty Feldman). Shot in black-and-white and looking every bit as atmospheric and eerie as the original horror classic, this is possibly the best comic spoof of any film. Rather than being over-the-top, silly, grotesque or irreverent, much like today's spoof-comedies, it pays homage to Frankenstein and keeps the spirit of the classic alive, everything from the original music by John Morris, which is dramatic and lively, to the cinematography by Gerald Hirschfield and the impressive production design and costumes by Dorothy Jeakins, which pay tribute to 1930's horror films. When Dr. Frankenstein puts together a cadaver and brings it to life in his laboratory, little does he know how things will really turn out. Actor Peter Boyle, in Frankenstein get-up, plays the monster. Far from intimidating, Dr. Frankenstein trains him like a kind of kid genius and shows him off to the public in a hilarious dance bit- ""Putting On The Ritz"". Frankenstein in the original horror film and novel is a kind of chaotic attempt to re-create a human being, complete with feelings of hate and love. Here, the comedy takes this a step further and provides him with a powerful male libido. This is hilariously showcased in the famous sex scene with Madeline Kahn's Elizabeth, who becomes drawn to the creature, mates with it and climaxes while singing ""O, sweet Mystery of Life, at last I've found you"". Madeline Kahan would become a regular comedienne in the films of Mel Brooks after this film. Gene Wilder hams it up as the mad scientist, and is comfortable in a comic film, settling into the groove he'd entertain audiences with throughout the 1970's, some films being his own project, others comic collaborations with Mel Brooks. But Mel Brooks is the creative force behind this film, which soon enjoyed the status of a classic comedy. Mel even provided the voice for Frankenstein. Sit back and enjoy this comic jewel from the 1970's which saw many fine comedies, such as those by Woody Allen. Well-written, great-looking after all this years, Young Frankenstein remains a beloved comedy.",Young Frankenstein
114,Isaac5855,Mel Brooks' masterpiece and one of his most quotable films...,9,26 July 2006,"What else can be said about this classic that hasn't already been said? 1974's YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is Mel Brooks' dead solid perfect parody of the Frankenstein films, BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN in particular, in which we meet Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder)who is the grandson of the Frankenstein of folklore, who inherits his grandfather's castle and eventually becomes obsessed with his grandfather's dream of re-animating dead tissue. Everything works here, partly because I think Brooks chose to stay behind the camera this time. I have found his work where he stays behind the camera is better. Brooks has assembled a perfect cast: Wilder is brilliant as the deranged doctor, Marty Feldman creates one of the great comic characters in cinema history with Igor (""It's pronounced ""Eye-gore""), Peter Boyle makes a charming creature and Cloris Leachman brilliantly channels Judith Anderson in her Frau Blucher. Teri Garr is a lovely Inga and Madeline Kahn is memorable as Frederick's fiancée Elizabeth. It's one gag after another here and almost all of them work. Personally, I think Kenneth Mars' Inspector Kemp is a bit over the top, but why carp? But above all, you have the classic Brooks/Wilder screenplay, which has become part of pop-culture folklore...I'm pretty sure anyone who has ever scene this film can quote at least two or three lines from it. A comedy classic that just gets better with age...like fine wine.",Young Frankenstein
115,innocuous,I waited 30 years to watch THIS??,2,2 January 2005,"I was a senior in college when this movie was released. I did not see it at the time and then just sort of avoided it on videotape and then DVD...for no particularly good reason. I loved ""Blazing Saddles"" and I now own a copy, but I could never seem to get around to watching YF. Finally, my younger brother's fanaticism about the movie forced me to rent it and watch it, some 30 years after it was released.Seldom have I been so disappointed in a movie. The trivia for this movie states that Mel Brooks made up scenes after the main filming was completed because everyone had so much fun that they didn't want to stop. I believe it. The marks of self-indulgence are all over this movie, from the ""operatic"" screams of passion to the deadpan looks every performer casts to the audience. ""Breaking the fourth wall"" has never before been done so often with so little positive results. This movie redefines ""telegraphing the punchline.""Sorry...not a chuckle, not a laugh, not a giggle, not even a smile. This movie just doesn't make the mark. The humor is trite, clichéd, and unoriginal. (And don't bother telling me that this film is 30 years old and was the basis for the humorous clichés we now see in films. Every bit of what passes for humor in this movie can be traced to films that went before it.) * out of *****",Young Frankenstein
116,movieguy1021,Young Frankenstein: 9/10,9,9 October 2002,"1974 was Mel Brooks' biggest year, with Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles releasing. Most people, including me, think that Young Frankenstein is the better one.YF starts off with a college class, with Fredrick von Frankenstein (pronounced Fronk-en-steen), played perfectly by Gene Wilder, teaching a science class. We learn that his grandfather tried to reanimate dead beings, and Fredrick doesn't like him. But, he inherits his grandfather's castle and begins working where his grandfather left off.He has to leave his fiancè Elizabeth, played with great snootiness by Madeline Kahn. At the castle, Fredrick meets Igor (pronounced Eye-gor) who is played by bug-eyed Marty Feldman. Also, Fredrick meets Inga, his, ahem, assistant, played by Teri Garr. She is also very funny. So, Fred gets to work and eventually creates a monster, played by Peter Boyle.YF is one of the funniest pictures of all time. Gene Wilder is, as always, great, while Madeline Kahn, who I adore, plays an equally great part as Elizabeth. She exchanges great lines with Fredrick, but so does Inga. Teri Garr is hilarious as his assistant, but I think the funniest part is Igor. He knows when to joke.The funniest part of the movie is the charades (""Said a dirty word!""). Kenneth Mars didn't do anything for me as the mechanical-armed Inspector Kemp, but the dart scene is pretty funny.Not as rude as other Brooks' movies, but funnier that them. If you want to laugh every time you see it, then rent (or even better, buy) Young Frankenstein.My rating: 9/10Rated PG for some language and sex-related humor.",Young Frankenstein

It's not very often that I watch so-called ""Classic"" and say ""I can definitely see why this movie is a classic!"", but after watching this movie, I can definitely see why this is called a classic.  The movie was really good, better than I expected.  Some of the jokes are kind of lame compared to today's tastes, but there were some parts that I thought were just hilarious, I even had to rewind the movie at a few parts, cause I was laughing so hard.Mel Brooks has a very odd taste in comedy, some of the comedy is just bizarre, but I love it!  I didn't think it was as funny as ""Spaceballs"", but it still deserves a viewing.  The only other Mel Brooks movies that I've seen are ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" and ""Life Stinks"", and they're both pretty good too.  If you like the other Mel Brooks movies, then you'll probably like this one too.The cast was great too.  I loved Peter Boyle as the monster and Teri Garr is great too.  As I was watching the movie I was trying to think of what other movies I'd seen with Gene Wilder, and I couldn't think of any.  I thought that was so odd that I know who the actor is, but I couldn't think of any of his films.  When I finished the film I went and looked up his movies on IMDB and noticed that I hadn't seen a single movie with him in it.  Although, I have seen parts of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"".  Is that sad or what?  I guess I've got some movie watching to do.Thanks for reading-Chris",Young Frankenstein
119,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: wonderful puns, aging",6,25 August 2002,"Young Frankenstein is quite a masterpiece given that it is clearly a low budget black and white film. To be fair, a lot of comedy has come out since 1974 and the timing and acting leave something to be desired. I am forced to say that I was a little disappointed that the movie wasn't as good as I had remembered.But enough of the gags work that -- if you like cult flicks like Airplane! or Big Trouble in Little China -- the movie can be considered a classic. And I love the music. It is definitely Mel Brooks' best, certainly better than High Anxiety.Who should see this film:-- punsters and comedy lovers of the wacky type who like Monty Python and the Holy Grail-- nobody elseI'll give Young Frankenstein a charitable 8 out of 10.",Young Frankenstein
120,Horror-yo,"Fun, but not a great movie",6,31 August 2016,"This film is basically the original Frankenstein story, just only with a slightly different introduction. Of course, it's a parody, so it should follow its original source, yet we seem to be getting more actual, serious plot here than parody and comedy. It seems to be more of the Frankenstein story with a twist, rather than an out and out comedy/parody with an underlying original concept.In short, this Mel Brooks comedy seems to be benefiting a lot from the story it borrows, and overall has gathered lots of credit it may not deserve; as for the actual additions, they're fine, but not nearly incredible. Some gags are fun, some VERY thick as always with Mel Brooks and his very obvious, in-your-face type of humor.It makes for a fun viewing, but let's not forget how much of the film owes to the original concept and earlier renditions. 6.5/10",Young Frankenstein
121,oOoBarracuda,"""This is a nice boy. This is a sweet boy. This is a mother's angel.""",10,13 June 2016,"1974 was a busy year for Gene Wilder. In addition to appearing in four other movies, he co-wrote Young Frankenstein with Mel Brooks, while performing as the film's lead. Not even 10 years after his film debut, he had several starring roles under his belt and had now moved on to production aspects, writing, this time, a sign of things to come in the future. Along with Wilder in starring roles, Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, and Teri Garr round out an extraordinary first writing effort for Wilder. A neurosurgeon out to prove that his family lineage doesn't define him was a fun romp in the hay for audience members in this spoof classic.Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has had a hump to get over all of his life. As the grandson to the infamous Dr. Victor Frankenstein, people all over the world expected him to be just as obsessed with bringing the dead to life. Frederick's only concern was distancing himself from his grandfather, and continuing his career as a neurosurgeon. When he is drawn to his grandfather's home and laboratory in Transylvania, he is pulled into his grandfather's experiments when he finds his private library and journals. Believing the Dr. Frankenstein before him may have been on to something, Frederick, along with his assistants Inga (Teri Garr) and Igor (Marty Feldman), attempts to reanimate a human giant. Filled with antics like only Brooks can deliver, Young Frankenstein is the perfect, loyal spoof to the 1930's era trailblazers of horror. Film mastery this is; Young Frankenstein was Mel Brooks at his best. When I think about the writing team that Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder could have been, I shudder to think about all we missed out on. If only they would have collaborated more is the underlying message throughout this film. Wilder brought Brooks to a more controlled level of humor, and Brooks brought Wilder to a higher plane of comedy, as Wilder was his funniest in Young Frankenstein. Gene Wilder really doesn't get the credit he deserves for this film gem. The concept of Young Frankenstein was his, the idea to do the film in black and white was his, he merely recruited Brooks due to his directorial mastery. Of course, Brooks has his touches throughout the film and the audience prospers from those touches; the film is Wilder's baby, however, and it's saddening that he is overlooked for his contribution to such a classic. The main characters in this film, including Madeline Kahn, all acted wonderfully together and their on-screen chemistry is something of film magic. With so many great running gags in this movie, it's almost as if you're watching a sketch show for an entire film's length, and one never tires of it. Do yourself a favor and watch Young Frankenstein, it's almost sure to become a yearly Halloween tradition.",Young Frankenstein

For instance Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best original score and I believe it should have won for Best Director, Actor, and screenplay.Another side note: As an aspiring filmmaker I have found a lot of inspiration from this movie.

There could be some really good laughs if it were directed by a woman with a better sense of humour than Mel Brooks (not too hard). Why doesn't someone do this? It would only take about $2m, which is what YF cost in the first place (and made $83m). The profits would be enormous and women seeing it would feel great, instead of ridiculed as they are in YF. Instead they have to watch tedious vampire flicks, or silly Hunger Games episodes.It must be so awful to be a young female in the US today and have a pervert (guaranteed) for a boyfriend.

Instead of a mad doctor, Frederick is a neurosurgeon and is now about to inherit the castle of his grandfathers. While exploring the castle, he comes across his grandfathers servant Igor (Marty Feldman) who just can't seem to keep his hump on the left or right side of his back.

Among the best scenes include: the dart throwing scene, the fixing of Ab-Normals brain into the monster (a discovery by Igor), and the monster and Gene Wilder doing a tap dance. The comedy is the best it will ever get. Mel Brooks proves that he is a genius for righting spoofs and would later continue with his creation Spaceballs (1987).The whole film is shot in black and white as sort of an honor to the traditional horror flicks.

For starts the cast is the Mel Brooks team , wow, they are for sure some of the funniest people ever to walk to earth so this movie can not be bad. The quotes, the slapstick and the timing is almost flawless and the fact that more than half a century later, we still laugh out loud with this jewel ,shows that what is funny stays funny. To go to the plot, the grandson of the original Frankenstein is called to come to the ancestral castle of his house and he, though he wants to distance himself from the family history, goes and in the end the traditional lunacy of the Frankensteins can not be put under control. To write more it would a spoil ,so go watch it. The parody part is the fact that takes a well known story and makes fun of its main elements, in this case the clichés of the mad scientist and Gothic horror with great effect as well as say it own story and makes us care for what with happen. The later part is where the most parodies lose and become in all honest a dumb ,offencive movie( Meet the Spartan or Superhero Movie anyone?) ,but here we thankfully do not have to deal with that.

134,Donatien3,Young Frankenstein is absurd fun.,7,27 September 2006,"While over thirty years old, ""Young Frankenstein"" is typical Mel Brooks. It's silly, absurd, has some clever sight gags and cringeworthy puns, and while it may not contain the self-referential, breaking-the-fourth-wall humour which made ""Spaceballs"" a classic, it's still fun. Based, obviously, on Mary Shelley's original creation, and filmed in black-and-white, ""Young Frankenstein's"" plot is simple enough for a comedy of this nature. Gene Wilder plays Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced ""Fronkonstein""), a medical lecturer, who one day, receives the will of his grandfather, Victor von Frankenstein, creator of the eponymous monster, learning he's inherited Victor's old Transylvanian castle. Upon arriving in Transylvania, leaving behind his girlfriend Elizabeth (Madeline Khan), he meets Igor (pronounced ""I-gor""; played by Marty Feldman), and his assistant Inga (Teri Garr, playing the stereotypical blonde love interest). After discovering his grandfather's downstairs laboratory, he begins pouring over Victor's old medical notes pertaining to the Frankenstein project, and after initially trying to live down his heritage, become immersed in attempting to create another Frankenstein, despite some resistance from current tenant Frau Blaucher (Cloris Leachman). Frau's appearance ignites the film's most sustained running gag; whenever her name is uttered; horses start neighing in terror. Upon successfully digging up a large enough body, Frederick's plans go awry, when I-gor, instead of picking out the right brain, takes an abnormal brain (or in his words, the brain from ""Abby Normal""). After eventually waking up, the mono-syllabic Frankenstein monster escapes and, while he appears threatening, he simply wants to be loved. One scene involves him walking into the house of a lonely blind man (Gene Hackman), where he invites the monster in for tea. Unfortunately, the meal goes awry, when, in attempting to light a cigar, the blind man sets Frankenstein's thumb on fire.Realising the monster's needs, and under pressure from Inspector Kemp (a German officer with one mechanical arm, which he constantly has to set into position) Frederick sets out to court public sympathy for him, which culminates in a hilarious performance of ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" between the two of them, before Frankenstein's fear of fire causes the performance to end abruptly. With Frederick and Inga's love blossoming, Elizabeth arrives in Transylvania, where she is taken by Frankenstein, and, impressed by one particular part of his body, becomes ""The Bride of Frankenstein"". In the end, in order to save the monster from a lifetime of fear and misunderstanding, Frederick's realises he must make a personal sacrifice.While the movie takes a little while to get going, once the groundwork has been laid, it gets funnier, especially with the arrival of Marty Feldman. It parodies the films of the genre well, the most notable touch being the crackles of lightning at just the right moment. Well worth a look, especially for Brooks fans.",Young Frankenstein

Mel Brooks' classic, Young Frankenstein, is in black and white and looks like it could have been the sequel to the Frankenstein movies of the 1930s, and that's a complement. The black and white, the use of the original sets from the famous movies all add up to a visual delight. This movie would not have worked if it were in color. The lighting is too dark for successful color, so the decision to shoot in black in white was perfect and gives the movie a wonderful visual style. The story isn't bad either. Gene Wilder plays the grandson of the infamous Dr. Frankenstein (Wilder also wrote the movie) who finds out the secret that brought the monster to life to begin with. With help from his assistants Igor (a very funny Marty Feldman) and Inga (Teri Garr), Frankenstein is able to bring Peter Boyle, he plays the monster, back to life. There are other funny performances, Cloris Leachman is the Frankenstein house sitter who may or may not have had a relationship with horses, Gene Hackman as the blind man in the woods (directly out of The Bride of Frankenstein in the movie's best parody), Kenny Mars as the town detective who had a wooden arm, and a Brooks' favorite, Madeline Kahn as Dr. Frankenstein's lover, who may have found love in an unexpected place at the end of the movie. Not as consistently funny as Blazing Saddles, which came out earlier in 1974, or as socially biting as The Producers, Young Frankenstein is still a wonderful homage to the monster movies of the 1930s and 40s, with a great black and white look that reminds us of what movies used to be.",Young Frankenstein

146,fredericksmith1952,Mel Brooks is a genius,10,21 January 2012,"Mel Brooks is, in my humble opinion, nothing short of a genius when it comes to satire. In this film, he takes a shot at all the old black and white horror films of the 1940's and 1950's, using elements of Dracula (the Castle), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (imprisoned on the wheel), King Kong (the stage scene), and Frankenstein. Gene Wilder, who also co-wrote the Screen Story and Screenplay with Brooks, is the wild eyed, pseudo conservative scientist who is inexorably drawn into the world of his ancestors with little encouragement. Marty Feldman (God bless you, Marty) is priceless as Igor, the misshapen hunchback with a terrific sense of humor and a passion for the ladies. Teri Garr....hmm...one word...Wooof! Perfectly ditsy and blonde, her character adds the perfect setup lines for the dry and witty humor of Wilder and Feldman. The entire cast is fantastic, and the photography in black and white is a treat for anyone who appreciates the medium. The inclusion of the original Frankenstein laboratory equipment with the permission of Kenneth Strickfaden was a particularly nice touch. Now while there is sexual innuendo in the film, the tone is more Vaudeville than lewd, and I think most families could watch this with the kiddies in the room and not be offended. And if you are not aware, Young Frankenstein: The Musical, is currently touring the U. S. and is as entertaining as the original film. See it, love it, own it, and pass it down to your grandchildren as a priceless example of a bygone era where everything was fair game for satire.",Young Frankenstein
147,jay4stein79-1,There. Now I've Touched It...,9,9 April 2006,"When I was nine, I loved Mel Brooks. Nothing could be finer than Spaceballs or Blazing Saddles, though, truth be told, I didn't find much to laugh about in Young Frankenstein. I'm older now and find it difficult to sit through the former two films; I love Young Frankenstein. It's a riotous send-up of those 1930s Universal monster movies (Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolf Man, etc.), following one Frederick Frankenstein as he returns to his family's native land and begins following in his grandfather's god-playing footsteps. Those familiar with the Frankenstein films will know the story; heck, everyone's probably familiar with the story. It's also an extremely affectionate film. It mocks those often self-serious horror movies, but it loves them too, recreating the mood they evoked through glorious cinematography and stylized acting. Young Frankenstein isn't, then, a mean-spirited satire. It's more like when you're sitting next to a friend and nudge them in the side, recalling ""you remember that time you _fill in the blank_. Man that was funny.""Why is Young Frankenstein funny? It's good joke to dud ratio is amazingly high; Brooks was, as they say in sports, ""in the zone."" Every gag (""nice knockers,"" ""roll in the hay,"" ""it's FRONKenstein,"" etc.) hits its mark, it seems, and there are wonderful set pieces too (the blind man in the woods and putting on the ritz numbers come to mind). The movie also looks like it was made with some attention to detail. You typically don't come away from a Mel Brooks movie remembering the framing and photography; with Young Frankenstein, you do. It's a credit to Brooks for taking more time and concerning himself with cinematic matters and not just the humor. Unfortunately, the quality of Mel Brooks's films deteriorated quickly after Young Frankenstein. High Anxiety and History of the World had their moments, but after that Brooks became, it seemed, a caricature of himself. Spaceballs was, really, 10 years too late to be an effective farce; Men in Tights was similarly misguided; and do not ask me about Dracula Dead and Loving It. I have actually not seen Silent Movie, which, I have heard, is quite good. It's really too bad. Mel Brooks showed with Young Frankenstein that he could make a great movie; looking at the film in the continuum of his films now, though, it seems more like a fluke than an artistic maturation.",Young Frankenstein
148,noizyme,Classic comedy about a great horror character,7,29 November 2004,"This truly is a film made from the heart of its makers and cast. Mel Brooks directed this masterpiece based on the older looks of the movies before when it was made (1974) and kept the comedy subtle at times and in-your-face at others. Frederick Frankstein, played by Gene Wilder, has decided to prove his father's experiments to reanimate a human after death as a hoax. When he gets to the castle where the experimenting took place, his view on the project changes and Frankstein continues the research and overall successes and failures that came with the creation.So automatically, you think ""OK, just like Mary Shelley's vision of the doctor and his monster."" But that's where Brooks and Wilder come in and help with comedic possibilities in the castle. From the bumbling Igor (pronounced eye-gore), played by the bug-eyed Marty Feldman, to Teri Garr's character as Inga, the ""assistant"" to Dr. Frankenstein, everybody around Wilder's Frankenstein enacted upon him to keep going with his experimenting and resolutions. The characters were all memorable and hilarious, and, in contrast to most character films, the actors knew when to dumb down their characters and when to have them go crazy and hilarious.I thought that time kinda works against this film a little. The comedic movies that are released now don't work as hard as this crew did on this film, granted, but the jokes and pun-humor that is included in this movie is a little dated and old-timed. Its a definitive Brooks film, however, and that needs some recognition because Mel has been making great films for many years, all with great premises and gags. The music was eerie and tried for the feel of the 30's Frankenstein but mixed well with the showboating scene when the monster dances with its creator onstage in front of the town-audience. The sets were straight out of the original Frankstein (many of the original props and settings were used for the film, BTW) and the set designer was a genius with his vision, as well.I gave this film a 7/10 because it still feels a bit dated and hard to watch a little bit, but the comedy added that comfort to keep you watching.",Young Frankenstein
149,jennfinn,Eye-Gor,10,21 January 2021,"Young Frankenstein was released in 1974 when I was just two years old, I'm now 49 and it's still one of my all time favorite movies. Mel Brooks is a comedic genius and combined with Gene Wilder who co-wrote, it couldn't be anything less than absolutely amazing. Gene Wilder shines as Doctor Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced Frank-en-STEEN), grandson of the infamous Victor Frankenstein. He's just arrived at his late grandfather's castle in Transylvania which he's inherited and he's determined to prove his grandfather wasn't crazy. Victor's housekeeper, Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman) and his lab assistant, Igor (pronounced Eye-gor) (Marty Feldman) greet him at the castle and both are eager to show him the laboratory. Leachman and Feldman are both amazing and you're sure to laugh every time they're on screen. Peter Boyle steals the show as Frankenstein's Monster with the brain of Abby Normal (Abnormal) thanks to Igor destroying the correct brain. Forty Seven years later and Young Frankenstein is just as funny as when it premiered.",Young Frankenstein
150,schroeder-gustavo,Great Homage,8,9 July 2015,"Young Frankenstein is a great parody of classic horror films, particularly Frankenstein. The greatest thing about this Mel Brook's comedy classic is that you can really tell it was made with so much affection for both Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. I think most of the humor in the movie is hit or miss, but in my case it was mostly hit. There were some parts in the movie that tried to be funny but I didn't quite get it, mostly because it feels at times very immature and juvenile, but most at the time, the movie is actually very mature and it understands the type of movie that it is. Most of the time this is actually a very smart film, not everyone could achieve this affectionate parody, but Mel Brooks did it and that is praise-worthy. The movie features an amazing performance from Gene Wilder as Frankenstein, he was cast perfectly for the role. The cinematography really resembles that of the original Frankenstein films, which I loved.Young Frankenstein is a great comedy, a movie that understands what it is doing most of the time and, although childish at times, I think fans of the original Frankenstein films and horror classics in general will enjoy this one.",Young Frankenstein
151,caseynicholson,Well Made--But I Couldn't Quite Get into It,7,6 October 2016,"I saw this movie in a theater release last night--a release that I'm sure has been arranged due to Gene Wilder's recent death. I'd never seen the movie before, so I went into it not knowing entirely what to expect. I've never seen any of the Boris Karloff ""Frankenstein"" movies, so allusions to those were a bit lost on me. I have, however, read Mary Shelley's ""Fankenstein"" novel, so I'm very familiar with the original source material.Rather than being a twist on the original ""Frankenstein"" story itself, this movie takes a Frederick Frankenstein as its lead protagonist, explaining that Frederick is the grandson of the late Victor Frankenstein, the late famous inventor who brought the original monster to life. Frederick sets out to replicate his grandfather's work, and the movie revolves around the events that occur thereafter. Like the early 20th Century Karloff films, ""Young Frankenstein"" is filmed in black and white--a technique that works well considering its source material.All in all this movie plays out like one might expect a Mel Brooks movie to play out. It's full of zany slapstick moments, some of which are fairly humorous. The genius of the film is perhaps that it does more or less replicate the original ""Frankenstein"" tale, but does so with overt comedy throughout.All that said, this was a well made film and one that I'm glad I took the time to see. Still, all things considered I can only give it 7/10 stars simply because I just couldn't totally get into it. Sure, it's easy enough to follow and there's no problem comprehending the storyline--it tells its tale quite well. But I guess it was the whole notion of a spoof on Frankenstein that was a bit lost on me. Maybe it's because I really enjoyed the Shelley novel, which itself has a very serious tone about it-- with an even more serious message. Or maybe I'm just not cut out for slapstick. Whatever the case, I can totally see why many people would rank this movie higher--but for me, personally, I can only go with 7/10 stars.",Young Frankenstein
152,refinedsugar,Hilarious? Really?,6,14 March 2001,"I dunno, maybe I'm jaded. When I think of material apt for laughs and parody, a modern day spoof on the Frankenstein fable doesn't leap to mind. It must have for Mel Brooks. Sure why not. Frankenstein movies have been around for ages and although their popularity has severely dropped, maybe there's some untapped comedy to be found within. Under Mel Brooks, you'd think it would be a gold mine. Not really so, at least, not for me. I'll admit I laughed or smiled a couple of times, but unfortunately, I can count those all on one hand. To use a tried and true saying, the movie has its moments, but they're too far and in between. In my mind, a really good comedy has to have at least one gut-bust no matter the type of comedy on displayed. If a movie can make me laugh that hard it's a step closer to getting a favorable word. I never gut-busted once during Young Frankenstein and I have a hard time imagining anyone doing so unless they are under the influence or laugh very easily at the simplest of things.I think it's just the material itself. It's just rather limiting is all. Where can you go with Frankenstein? Its dated and you have to try and be funny without getting ""stupid"" all the while staying within the scope of the material you're defacto lampooning. They hit the usual targets and some that are not, but most of the jokes are direct and served right in front of your face. You can see them coming and the payoff more times than not will be no more than a smile. The idea that these people are playing characters within a movie, straight laced all but once or twice - almost a movie within a movie if you will - helps set and maintain the atmosphere, its just I found little going on from a funny perspective one moment to another.I fully agree with anyone who says this film fully grabs the mood of it's intended source material, especially the choice decision of filming in B&W, but that doesn't produce laughs in itself. Young Frankenstein is worth watching once, sure, but in the archives of really funny movies, it doesn't make any 'best-of' list for me.",Young Frankenstein

The first things I noticed that I hadn't previously is that this film is visually very beautiful and also that it had a marvelous score, especially the violin part that the characters play to calm the creature.Just like in The Producers the acting is for me one of if not the best part of the film, I especially like Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman who was funny as hell, Peter Boyle is also great as the creature and pretty much all the cast is also good.
The film is hilarious and very enjoyable however I do feel like it gets a little stale towards the end, but that's just my opinion.This is only the second Mel Brooks film I have seen but I have absolutely loved both of them and both are 2 of my favorite comedies (the other film of him I've seen, The Producers, might even be my favorite of all time) however this may be because these two, together with Blazing Saddles wich I want to watch next, are usually considered as the director's best.

The parody can be brilliantly funny (most are horrid), and this one is near perfect.Mel Brooks hits all nails right on the head in this black & white classic. Taking its themes from the Mary Shelley novel and providing some bang on homage/parody to the James Whale classic, ""Bride of Frankenstein"", Young Frankenstein is a breathless laugh and a half. In a weak comedy, you have the entire cast setting up one character for the laughs. Here, you have every character providing humour in every scene. None more than the late Marty Feldman as Igor, who slyly seems to know that he is in a parody movie. (Note how his hump changes sides and his occasional hilarious double takes and asides). Teri Garr is a combination of fabulously sexy and extremely funny - a difficult combination to pull off. Madeline Khan is hysterical as usual as the frigid fiance Elizabeth, whose long dormant sexuality is awaken by the monster himself. And of course, there is Gene Wilder, the straight man in this madness, deflecting jokes, setting up pratfalls, while all the while trying desperately to bring his monster to life. Also play close attention to the Inspector, a small role played by the same actor who played the psychotic Nazi composer Franz Liebkind in Brooks earlier (and best) film, the producers.Young Frankenstein is readily available on video and has not aged a bit.

One of the jokes was about the size of the monster's schlong, and how he can ""go eight times"". Not even Mel Brooks can get away with calling that humor.But there were several funny quirks in the movie. The horses braying, the couple talking on the train, and everything Kenneth Mars does.

161,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,7,4 July 2013,"Young Frankenstein is praised by many as one of the funniest movies in history. It is certainly a lovely movie, with great performances – mainly those of Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman – and an interesting, modern remake of the original Mary Shelley novel. I particularly liked the fact that it's black and white – this helps greatly in creating the creepy and old-movie-like atmosphere. It's also quite funny, but I suggest you don't see it more than once because it might disappoint you after more viewings.The respectable doctor Frederik Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has tried for many years to cut the ties with his family, as his grandfather, the baron, had become famous for trying to reanimate dead bodies and in his opinion, his grandfather's work was crap. But after he arrives to the Transylvanian castle that belonged to his late grandfather, Frederik discovers his diary and decides to try and reanimate someone dead himself, as it appears his grandfather had succeeded. In this task, he is aided by Igor (Marty Feldman) and Inga (Teri Garr).As I said, the atmosphere in this movie is great: it's all black and white, and it features mostly night scenes in the creepy Transylvanian environment, with howling wolves and fog all around. This characteristic is also very well used in some jokes. Marty Feldman is amazing as Igor, and the character himself is so funny and strange, it's delightful to watch him. Gene Wilder does an incredible job in portraying Dr. Frankenstein, especially in his madness. Peter Boyle, even though he doesn't speak most of the time since he's the monster, is very good nonetheless.This movie is also a nice homage to the old Universal movies. Unfortunately, Young Frankenstein fails as a comedy. Not horribly, but still. Some of the jokes are repetitive and not very funny, although there are some truly amusing scenes. Also, some parts are slow and boring. But considering how horrible modern spoofs are, this movie really shouldn't be bashed. I would definitely recommend watching it, especially since the first time you might just find it hilarious.Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",Young Frankenstein

Where weaker parodies pushed plot onto the back-burner, using them merely as a springboard for crude humour lacking any form of subtlety, Young Frankenstein takes the opposite approach. It deals heavily in the themes of its victim and instead uses it as the groundwork on which to build clever and witty comedy. Where parodies of later years would try their hardest to try as little as possible, effectively killing the genre, the attention to detail here is what makes the film a success.

165,Chuck-149,One of the best comedies of all-time.,8,25 September 2000,"Frankenstein is one of the best horror stories ever told in the history of mankind.  The story of a mad man who was able to bring a dead person back to life has shocked nations and generations and will shock in the future as well.  This is probably one of the reasons why Mel Brooks' movie is so great.  He was able to take a serious story, almost traumatising and make a classic comedy out of it.  His movie is a pure satire from beginning to end and this is where you can see how hard he must have worked on this movie. His more recent movie Spy Hard (1996) was quite disappointing because the humor there seemed much more sexual and the parody wasn't all that great. The only interesting part of that movie was the variety of different scenes Brooks mixed in although they didn't really blend well together.  In most movies in which you have a very rich man and his butler, the butler is quite often very funny and delivers some of the best jokes.  The best example for that would have to be John Gielgud's role in Arthur (1981) which won him a best supporting actor Oscar.  He played a wise-cracking butler who was able to be snide to his master without being too impolite. However, I seem to find that Martey Feldman as Igor in Young Frankenstein was even funnier than John Gielgud was in Arthur.  This is the second part of Young Frankenstein.  Finally, the third part of Young Frankenstein has to with family reputation.  Gene Wilder plays Fredric Frankenstein and does not like his name because of the reputation it was given by his crazy grandfather.  He wants nothing to do with his past family but when his great grandfather's will is found and asks him to return to Transylvania, he sees no choice but to go out of respect for his predecessor.  Upon arriving in Transylvania, he quickly meets Igor and is taken to the Frankenstein castle.  There, he soon becomes obsessed with the idea of bringing a dead human being back to life. This obsession is provoked by a woman who works at the castle and who was the mistress of Fredric's grandfather.  The rest of the story is developed in a very similar way to the original terrifying classic only in a highly comic manner.  Gene Hackman has a cameo as a blind priest and his scene is one of the funniest ones in the movie. Mel Brooks smartly directs this movie letting the viewer hope some things happen and others won't.  Gene Wilder's contribution to the script is another plus and he delivers his role very well.  The scene in the classroom is highly comic.  Also noticeable is Teri Garr who plays young Frankenstein's ""assistant"" in the laboratory room.  But Martey Feldman walks away with the movie as the snide and hilarious butler Igor.

It checks all the boxes: snappy plotting, clever dialogue, perfect cast; a parody that knows its source material extremely well and takes advantage of all opportunities to lampoon it effectively.Does an actor exist who could have played Eye-Gore with the spot-on comic precision that Marty Feldman brought to the role? Or an actress who could have played the vain, self-involved Elizabeth as well as Madeleine Kahn and made her so confusingly lovable in spite of herself? Or anybody other than Kenneth Mars with the physical and vocal range to bring Inspector Kemp to life? I honestly can't imagine it. And every minute Gene Hackman is on the screen as the blind hermit playing to Peter Boyle's increasingly frustrated Monster is pure gold.The ""little"" details like the use of Kenneth Strickfaden's original electrical equipment from Dr. Frankenstein's 1931 laboratory reveal how hard they worked on this film and how eager they were to get it just exactly right.Thank you, Mel Brooks, for two things. First of all, for co-writing it. Second, for having the good sense not to appear in it. (Seriously, I never thought much of Brooks as an actor I think ""High Anxiety"" might have been better if he'd stayed behind the scenes. I'm also not much of a fan of most of Brooks' other material, ""Blazing Saddles"", etc., but I feel he really hit the nail on the head with this one. Nobody can win 'em all.)",Young Frankenstein
168,tjsdshpnd,Mel Broks is truly a genius,8,18 April 2010,"Some people call Mel Brooks disrespectful because he chooses to spoof great classics. Some call him a genius because each of his spoof movies have actually inflated the popularity of the original. Whatever you think about him, you just cannot ignore his style of film-making and his great observational skills. It is an accepted fact that in order to truly enjoy spoofs, one has to watch the original movie first. But in case of Mel Brooks, his spoof movies can be viewed individually and they have their own comic impact. Young Frankenstein is one such work of Brooks which many consider his best. Young Frankenstein is a tribute to the Frankenstein movies from 1930 onwards. Character names have been changed but any one who has seen the original can identify the character. The movie has also been entirely shot in Black & White to give that 1930's feel. The movie has it's comic moments consistently and it keeps the viewer n splits. Mel Brook's observational quality has helped him to take notice of small things in the original and spoof them that others wouldn't have noticed. On the acting front, all actors have imitated the acting of the Black & White era, trying to over-dramatize things which adds to the comic quotient. Gene Wilder who is also the co-writer looks like a man possessed when he carries out his part. Whatever people say about spoofs, if it is done convincingly, it can be considered a great piece of cinema. I liked this movie and that is what matters to me.Rating : 8/10",Young Frankenstein
169,bilahn,Sophisticated comedy masterpiece,10,22 January 2002,"As far as I am concerned, this movie is beyond criticism. No, it may not be roll in the aisle hilarious, (tho if you react that way fine), rather it is much more subtle and sophisticated than that. You are supposed to just smile and chuckle - that's the point.  Combined with brilliant black and white photography, (color would be unthinkable for this movie) and terrific acting, Young Frankenstein is truly a classic, and frankly anyone who doesn't get it would not be on my list of the world's most perceptive movie goers.",Young Frankenstein

This movie is extra special if you grew up watching Universal horror films... It's an incredible spoof. I love it so, so much.",Young Frankenstein
171,MattyRich92,More than a spoof movie,8,6 May 2019,"Unlike most parody movies, it has a solid storyline that is complimented with jokes. It's usually the other way around. There's a nice mix of lowbrow and highbrow humor. It's pretty great for a spoof movie.",Young Frankenstein
172,gbrumburgh,EVERYTHING comes wonderfully to life in this dead-on Mel Brooks horror spoof  non-stop laughs from beginning to end!,10,15 May 2001,"Mel Brooks' parodies are like your favorite, worn-out couch.  You know it's not the greatest in style, taste and quality, but it just feels so damn comfortable.  Of late, most of Mel's spoofs have been off the mark, his work mellowing into predictability.  In fact, you really have to go all the way back to 1974 to see Brooks at his sharpest.  In that year we were awarded ""Blazing Saddles"" AND ""Young Frankenstein.""Perhaps ""Young Frankenstein"" is not definitive Mel Brooks, although he directed it.  Gene Wilder, who not only stars but co-wrote it with Mel, was the inspiration to make this movie.  And it's his influence, I think, that brings the best out in Mel.  When spoofing a historical era, movie genre or legendary tale, Brooks' satirical bag of tricks always included a hodgepodge of crude sight gags, burlesque schtick and stale Jewish jokes done at rapid-fire pace.  The plot became an after-thought, working around the barrage of unsubtle humor.  In targeting the classic Frankenstein' series, however, Brooks worked in reverse, wisely focusing on plot, tone and atmosphere, then complementing them with clever, carefully constructed bits.A rich staple of comedy pros from Brooks' fun factory (Mel graciously did not cast himself here) were employed to wring out the most laughs possible out of the fresh, inventive material.  Gene Wilder plays the frizzy-haired, eruptive college professor Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced FRONK-en-STEEN), grandson of the infamous scientist, who gives in to the maniacal tendencies of his mad ancestor after inheriting the late Baron's Teutonic castle.  His simmer-to-boil antics have seldom been put to better use, while only pop-eyed Marty Feldman, who gets to break the fourth wall as Igor (prounouced EYE-gor), the dim, oddball assistant, could milk a hump for all its worth.  Kenneth Mars too gets a lot of mileage out of his one-armed, slush-mouthed inspector.  In the film's most difficult role, Peter Boyle's appearance as the Monster is jarring at first, looking like a cross between Herman Munster and Uncle Fester.  But he increasingly wins you over, earning even a little empathy along the way.  His character is the most crucial for this parody to work right and he succeeds, figuring in a high percentage of the comedy highlights.Representing the distaff side, Madeline Kahn is one cool cucumber, stealing focus whenever she's on camera as the placid, meticulous, hopelessly stuck-up fiancee Elizabeth; Cloris Leachman sinks her teeth into the role of the grotesque Frau Blücher, whose mere mention of her name sends horses into panic; and Teri Garr is delightful as a dinghy Deutschlander who assists Frankenstein in his wild experiments and other things.An amalgamation of Universal's earliest and best Frankenstein' movies (""Frankenstein,"" ""Bride of Frankenstein"" and ""Son of Frankenstein,"" this spoof relies on close imitation and Brooks took painstaking methods to recreate the look and feel of James Whale's original sets, black-and-white photography and musical score.  It pays off in spades.Nearly 30 years later, this movie still leaves me in stitches.  Wilder and Garr's revolving secret door bit is still priceless, as is Cloris Leachman's ovaltine' routine and the Wilder/Boyle ""Puttin' On the Ritz"" tie-and-tail duet.  Boyle and the unbilled Gene Hackman in the ""Blind Hermit"" scene ripped off from ""Bride of Frankenstein"" are uproarious, easily winning the award for sustained hilarity in a single sketch.  Add Feldman's hump and Mars' troublesome mechanical arm and what you have is rib-tickling entertainment from start to finish.  Madeline Kahn's post-coital, cigarette-smoking scene with ol zipperneck' who leaves her in a sexual snit must go down in Hollywood annals as the funniest scene ever caught on camera.  Certainly Jeanette MacDonald's puristic rendition of ""Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life"" will never have quite the same meaning again after you've heard Madeline's spin on it. ""Blazing Saddles"" indeed has its insane moments but when it comes to toasting Mel Brooks in the years to come, ""Young Frankenstein"" should certainly stand front and center when representing this clown prince of comedy.",Young Frankenstein
173,mrspasm,Not for your eyes,10,14 September 2009,"This film was so scary I had to watch it through my fingers- my eyes were safely hidden in my pocket. Not surprisingly I couldn't really see what was going on and had to guess. As soon as I heard the scary music at the start I knew I wouldn't be able to handle it- it's the same feeling I got watching the Halloween episodes of Bugs Bunny, the ones where the scary green witch tries to eat him. Brrr, I'm getting spooky just thinking about it. The film seems to be about a crazy scientist whose children die in some sort of freak electrical accident, possibly involving a lighthouse. The scientist wants to bring his kids back from the dead and believes he can do this by taking the best body parts from each and stitching them together. There are various terrifying scenes of him lurking through graveyards and Undertaker's houses so that he can acquire all the extra parts he needs. Eventually he builds a son for himself but it still needs life. As everyone knows 300 millilitres of electricity (Stat!) blown into the heart and brain at the same time is enough to bring any living thing back from the dead- of course in real life this vary rarely happens. He does it and his son is reborn again. They are both crazy though, the creature doesn't know if he is one person or various considering all the different bits which make him up. Naturally he goes on a rampage and throws lots of other children into lakes with lawnmowers attached to them. This was never fully explained and (pardon the pun) struck me as a little strange. I don't want to talk anymore about this as it is too scary. I might watch it again when I'm thirty, as when you're 28 you shouldn't be watching scary movies like this; You should be watching films with explodings and boobs, and playing Guitar Heroes.Best Scene: When the monster breaks into Strictly Come Dancing and does a foxtrot with Brucie before mauling Bruno to death. I would give that a 4.5!",Young Frankenstein
174,alexandermangoldt,What's so funny?,6,18 February 2006,"I really don't know what sense of humor you need to have in order to find this movie hilarious. For all I know, I didn't catch myself laughing more than twice throughout the whole movie. Most of the jokes where simple slapstick, like Gene Hackman as the blind man pouring wine and soup accidentally all over the monster. And what with the German accent. As far as I know, Transylvania is not and never was a part of Germany, so why the thick German accent. No, honestly, for a whizkid like me there weren't any sophisticated jokes and hardly a scene managed to crack me up. Mel Brooks success is and will remain a mystery to me and I don't know how more movies of him I have to see in order to find out what's so great about him. I worked in a cabaret once and I found out that a lot of people just laughed because the guy on stage was a comedian, not because he was funny. And one particular comedian (German Helge Schneider) could do anything he wanted (ordinary things like pick up a cup of coffee) he had the whole crowd cheering. I guess this is what you call the Pygmalion effect. Hahaha!",Young Frankenstein
175,andrewnmiller,Everything that a comedy should be.,10,14 November 2017,"My first exposure to Young Frankenstein came from my dad and while I did laugh a few times, I didn't see it as anything special. Well, I recently re-watched it and I now consider it to be one of the best comedies ever made, from it's hilarious writing and homages to the horror genre to it's brilliant characters, Young Frankenstein is a absolute laugh riot.The movie starts with Dr. Frederick Frankenstein teaching at a medical faculty where he becomes enraged when a student brings up his grandfather to which Fredrick responds that his grandfather's work was garbage, but when an lawyer tells him that he has received his grandfather's country estate so Fredrick then journeys to Transylvania where he meets Igor and a youthful assistant named Inga. After arriving at the castle, the three stumble upon Victor's hidden laboratory and read his personal journals, and soon Fredrick chooses to continue his grandfather's research so he and Igor go to a cemetery and dig up a corpse and bring it back to the lab where they bring it back to life, but the monster is set free. Now, Fredrick, Inga and Igor must catch him before he can harm anyone else.Given the movie's content, Young Frankenstein has the honor of being one of the very few comedies that is just as hilarious for those people who have never any of the old-school monster movies that are being made fun of here and yet there's still lots of awareness for those who have seen the old horror movies and while it may seem off-putting to film a comical satire of one of the most iconic movie monsters in cinema history, but the movie unexpectedly comes across as the proper way to do an effective spoof as opposed to some recent spoof movies, but what's even more interesting is that the film gives us some extraordinary insight into the Frankenstein mythos or at least more than what I, Frankenstein ever could do. While the movie is a comedic remake of the 1932 classic, the story is pretty much identical, but there are quite a lot of differences like having the lead be the grandson of the mad genius, Igor is kind and the creepy caretaker is the one who pulls the strings and manipulates the lead character, but the film still maintains the heart and spirit of the original.When it comes to Mel Brooks as a director, he's always on top form no matter what genre he's making fun of but when he and Genre Wilder do a movie together does it become especially memorable as seen with 1967's The Producers or Blazing Saddles, while the straightforwardness Mel applies to the story coupled with Gene's comedic talents make Young Frankenstein stand above other comedies not to mention they co-wrote the script together and their conflicting attitudes when it comes to comedy allow them to take the best of both of their talents and are able to maintain a harmony between horror and comedy that perfectly works here. Mel does bash the viewer over the head and gets right in the thick of it then it comes to a joke or a quip, but then Wilder comes in, grasps it by the rear end and punches the stop button long enough for the joke to sink in and when you put these two masters together, they're like the ying and yang of the comedy universe. The script is one of the most ingenious for a major comedy movie and has all the necessary features that strongly conjure the basis of the old monster movies which have become a en-grained part of cinema today. What Brooks gives us is a Frankenstein movie with modern emotions while also giving the audience a cast of characters that take the story to a whole new level of funny and each actor fits into their roles with ease.First off, Marty Feldman is a wonderful Igor and his character introduction is one of the greatest in any comedy with an abrupt and memorable zoom of his smile and swelled eyes. To understand the comical abilities of Feldman calls for a ravenous craving and a connoisseur's delight. Marty's witty talents will catch the viewer completely off guard when he appears out of the blue or when he improvises a line of dialog or one just needs to pay close attention to Feldman's reaction once a joke has said and appreciate that Igor is a gag line within a gag line. The joke about his hump is one is classic Mel Brooks comedy. The other column holding the film's cast up is Peter Boyle as the Creature as it seems to fit the gentle giant rather than calling him a monster. Boyle delightfully personifies the condition of this misunderstood being which evokes the true spirit of Mary Shelley's original book, but he also does have some incredibly funny moments such as a scene with a blind priest which is still one of my favorite scenes in any comedy. Terri Garr is a delight to watch as Inga, Cloris Leachman steals the show as the sinister Frau Blucher, Kenneth Mars creates an enduring character by using a mutter and a wooden arm to comical effect and Madeline Kahn is wonderful as Frederick's fiancée Elizabeth, even Gene Hackman pops up for a cameo, but as wonderful as they all are, none come close to Genre Wilder as Frederick Frankenstein. He applies a elongated pause which is commonly followed by a minor eye moving that make even the most dull dialog funny. Gene's understated approach and dignified demeanor are a perfect fit for the movie, and when paired with Brooks' directing, allowing the comedy to come easily and openly and it always delivers on giving the audience the right chuckles at the right time.I could go on and on about how great Young Frankenstein is, but I would rather recommend that you see it for yourselves.",Young Frankenstein

In Georgia a few weeks ago, my spouse was undergoing some physical therapy work and I made a comment in the waiting room wishing her well in Frankenstin's laboratory. With that, another women looked up and said "" It is pronounced Fronkenstein."" Wonderful, the film has had that MUCH impact after so much time.The famous scene when Marty Feldman kept getting bits of fur in his mouth from Kahn's fox piece is still a wonderful evocation of old slapstick and Marx Brothers comedy.

We are treated to a huge elaborate Transylvania castle, and they even dug up the old 'monster resurrection' equipment from the original Frankenstein movie! The actors are TOP NOTCH, with particular homage to Madeline Kahn ""It's all the same with you men, 6 or 7 times and then it's off to the pub to brag to the boys... WELL YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!!!!!"" Marty Feldman, and of course, Gene Wilder. You can tell these actors LOVED this movie and laughed so much during it they would have done it for free. The chemistry is excellent and the lines are delivered perfectly.The quirky inclusion of the dance number 'Putting on the Ritz', suggested by Gene, is pure comic GENIUS and will go down in history as one of the funniest scenes ever done.I really cannot say enough about this movie.

180,Cheetah-6,Satire At It's Best,10,25 October 2001,"Besides the great performances by everyone involved and the top notch comic script writing, what makes this such a success is the beautiful creation of the 1930's monster movie look and feel.  Against this authentic backdrop everything comes off that much better and becomes more hilarious. Everything from the lighting in the little girl at the well scene to Madeline Kahn's bride of Frankenstein's hairdo is right on the mark. It seems not an easy feat to recreate a bygone era of  cinematic style and technique years after it's past but this one along with Woody Allen's ""Zelig"" are the absolute best in achieving this. This is Mel Brooks at the top of his talents and easily one of the best comedies of all time.",Young Frankenstein
181,caseyt-48511,The Funniest Comedy Ever Made,10,15 November 2019,"I know that's a big statement, but Mel Brooks' masterpiece Young Frankenstein deserves all the praise it gets. A parody and loving homage to classic 1930s horror films, Young Frankenstein sees the grandson of the infamous doctor continue his experiments. Add in an beautiful But ditzy assistant, an eccentric hunchback, his grandfathers former lover and the most lovable monster in all of movies, and you have one heck of a comedy.Out of all of Brooks' films, I feel this one has aged the best. The jokes don't feel dated and it isn't really offensive either. Yeah sure not everything has aged amazingly, like when the monster *cough* ""makes love"" to Elizabeth. But overall it holds up very well.This is probably Brooks' most widely appealing film. It's not to insane, it's actually pretty constrained for one of his movies. I think that works to it's advantage. No crazy fourth wall breakers or anything like that.The black and white cinematography is perfect. It really feels like a great 30s horror film with all the props and even the screen translations. It's all so well constructed for a comedy. Also, props to composer John Morris for his great musical score.The biggest strength, aside from the humor, are the actors. Few films ever assembled such a fine cast of hilarious actors. Gene Wilder gives his best performance here, playing straight most of the time. Marty Feldman was such a gifted performer and I wish he didn't leave us so soon. Madeline Kahn steals every scene she's in. She was so fun. Teri Garr plays her rather thankless role very well. She provided some of the best lines though. Cloris Leachman is another favorite of mine. She always played great crazy characters. Then of course there's the late Peter Boyle. The monster has got to be a very hard role to get right. Not even Robert De Niro could do it! But Boyle was superlative. He's the only person I think to live up to Boris Karloff's high standard.Young Frankenstein is funnier every time I see it.

This film is steadily funny throughout with everything from slapstick to subtle innuendo to a musical number to visual and verbal puns. Of course it's all the more enjoyable if you've seen the classic Frankenstein movies previously. In terms of cinematography, this black-and-white film is one of the best executed, most beautiful films imaginable. The mise-en-scene is exquisitely adept with opulent room settings filling the frame to the brim, a cobweb-strewn towering laboratory shot at oblique angles and even the use of a circular convex mirror to reveal action. The contrast range from the whitest white to the darkest black is incredible and the night scenes are breathtaking. All this in a movie that is actually funny! All the actors do a commendable job. Worth noting is Gene Hackman's brief standout performance as the blind man. Needless to say, no spoof/homage to the classic horror film will ever come close to this awesome achievement. This is probably one of the best films ever made and Mel Brooks can rest assured that it will be the vanguard of his legacy for generations to come.",Young Frankenstein
184,TheFinalAlias,Mel Brook's most stylish and consistently funny film,10,14 October 2009,"For my marathon of Non-Dracula Transylvania-based films I recently experienced(that's the only real way to describe it)Polanski's 'The Fearless Vampire Killers'. A great film to be sure, but not a very successful one in the comedy department, which is a shame since it's a huge problem in an otherwise fine film.It may count as cheating since I've been a fan of *this* film since adolescence, but even after all these years, I knew I would encounter no such problem in this Mel Brooks classic.'Young Frankenstein' has the distinction of being one of those few comedies which can be just as funny for those who have never seen the source material that's being spoofed(No problem for me as I was a fan of the Universal horrors since I was even younger and had read the book even earlier), and that still offers plenty of insight for those who have. And as unpromising as it sounds to make a comedic send up of Universal's horrors, which had displayed their ability to laugh at themselves as early as 1932; it ironically emerges as the very model of how to do a successful parody, and even more amazingly, it also offers some surprising insight into the themes of the Frankenstein legend itself, or at least; much more than Kenneth Branagh's overrated 'faithful' adaption ever did.The plot is basically a comedic remake of Rowland V. Lee's 'Son of Frankenstein'(1939). The set-up is virtually the same: A descendant of the original Doctor(Gene Wilder)returns to his family castle where he is ostracized by suspicious villagers led by a one-armed inspector(Kenneth Mars) and is coerced into taking up his ancestor's mantle by an unhinged former associate. The difference is that the protagonist is the grandson of the original monster-maker, the Ygor character(Marty Feldman, whose character actually is more closely patterned after Dwight Frye as Fritz & Karl than he is Bela Lugosi as Ygor) is benevolent and rather it is a sinister housekeeper(Cloris Leachman) who influences the protagonist, it also involves the creation of a new monster(Peter Boyle, giving a comedic take on the monster that is worlds beyond Clancy Brown's in 'The Bride') rather than the reviving of the original one. This doesn't stop Brooks from managing to work in references to the original from 1931 and the 1935 sequel. In less skilled hands this could have been disastrous, but thankfully Brooks was hip to the fact that 1935's 'Bride of Frankenstein' was already a horror-comedy, and he wisely didn't attempt to poke fun at things already meant to be funny. Instead he does his best to IMPROVE them. It's this approach that shows that Brooks is smarter than your average satirical filmmaker, and it's what separates him(well, besides actually being talented) from the myriad of other 'satirists' who would have either attempted to point out 'flaws' the original filmmakers were clearly aware of(Mst3k), lifted scenes verbatim(Wayans Bros.)or made up random unfunny jokes that had nothing to do with what was being spoofed(Friedberg & Seltzer).What's also remarkable is that, if one overlooks some small continuity issues(which the original Universals were JAM-PACKED with)such as names and locations(It's because this film takes place in 'Transylvania' that I am reviewing it for this marathon), as well as the comedic tone; this could actually be seen as a follow-up to the first 3 Universal Frankenstein films. Just imagine Gene Wilder's character as an adult version of Donny Dunagan from 'Son of Frankenstein' with a changed name(He mentions being embarrassed by his lineage and this leads to a running gag where he insists his name is pronounced 'Fronkensteen', making him not a self-hating Jew, but a self-hating mad scientist...who's also a Jew)to escape publicity and it works. They even have the same curly hair and Americanized personality. This suggest Brooks was aiming not at a mean-spirited comedic attack on decades old films, but at a loving homage/sequel to them instead. I can respect that.I could ramble on all day at how well it does justice to the original films and even the novel(For example; lots of people mention how when the Monster says 'You are my creator but I am your master' to Victor in the book how the Monster is in some ways a twisted reflection of Victor in that he exceeds him in all levels, proving more cunning, more sympathetic, more powerful and even has longer 'lustrous black hair' and how he actually succeeds in 'nailing' Elizabeth' by killing her long before Victor ever has sex with her; suggesting that the Monster, through a symbolic rape, is even better in bed than his creator! In 'Young Frankenstein' this subtext becomes overt: Here, the Monster DOES 'rape' Elizabeth, and she falls in love with him because of his 'Enormous schwanstucker' and deserts the doctor, leaving him to marry a busty servant girl(Terri Garr) he was sleeping with anyway)but, I think I'll rap up by saying that this film is as perfect as a parody can get, good atmospheric music, great production values and Oscar-worthy performances by all.Still, as much as I like experiencing 'local color' in foreign countries, and as much as I enjoyed Kenneth Mars's character, I hope that the Romanian police don't have accents THAT thick when I visit.~",Young Frankenstein
185,JoshSharpe,"""Put the candle back!""",9,27 January 2013,"Oh, where to begin. In my opinion, ""Young Frankenstein"" is one of the funniest movies ever made. From the first scene with Gene Wilder lecturing his class, to the ""Abby Normal"" sequence later on, this film is a joy to watch and will have have you smiling all the way through. After his grandfathers death, Dr. Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkensteen) begins experimenting with the idea of bringing dead humans back to life with the help of assistants Igor (pronounced Eye-gor) and Inga. From brief chuckles to bursts of hysterical laughter, this movie has it all.

186,silva-w-pius,Pointless dribble,4,20 February 2014,"The eighteenth-century English poet Samuel Taylor, once made a statement declaring, that anytime someone experiences a work of art, they must leave their ideas of reality at the door and see the work of art on its own merits – he called it 'the willing suspension of disbelief'. But unfortunately that statement can't be applied to Young Frankenstein; first of all it is not art! it is monstrosity with very little merits to its name, and because over the top performances, used to compensate for poor characters, a plot that often finds itself tripping over with its pants around its ankles and ultimately a movie with no real identity; is it a horror or is it a comedy? Well during the entire duration of the film, I neither jumped nor did I laugh, therefore it is neither and thus should be tossed in the bin! I'm not expecting another Casablanca or a Godfather, but at least have a plot line that makes sense. Years after the famed exploits of a crazed doctor Frankenstein and his monster, his great, great grandson finds himself as a lecturer at a university also studying the human body funny enough, expect that is where the similarities end, because the great grandson played by Gene Wilder, wants nothing to do with his great Grandfather doggies dealings, so detaches himself from the infamous man by requesting that everyone refers to him as 'Dr.FrankenSTIEN'. But unluckily for him, he soon finds out that he inherited the Granddad's castle and he accepts and goes to the castle – wait! If the guy wants nothing to do with his grandfather, then why not turn down the inheritance? Then as he turns up to the castle, he finds a book with his uncles tricks of reanimation and repeats the experiments? Didn't the guy change his name slightly just to remove any attachment to his Grandfather, yet 10 seconds later he does the exact same thing? The rest of the film barely deserves mention, but to cut a long story short; it is a lot of forced, contrived and unimaginative humour, which made me rather disappointed at Gene Wilder, especially when I love his other performances in Blazing Saddles and Charlie and the chocolate factory so much. Bad Gene, naughty step for you!",Young Frankenstein
187,CalvinValjean,It Really Is Mel Brooks' Best Film,9,30 August 2010,"Young Frankenstein is so incredibly authentic to its source material that at times it doesn't feel like a parody. I think this film, more than any of Brooks' spoofs, feels so much like the real thing, it's remarkable.I also agree that, of all his spoofs, this one really does have the most developed story. The characters feel like more than just caricatures and you come to care for them, especially Peter Boyle. Brooks also holds back on the anachronisms or breaking-the-fourth-wall that became the trademarks of his other works. While most of Brooks' other films just parody a genre, I really feel that Young Frankenstein actually works fine as story on its own. This is similar to how The Princess Bride is a good spoof of fairy tales, but works fine as a fairy tale on its own.Whenever I think of Young Frankenstein, I don't find myself thinking of the off-the-wall, laugh-out-loud-every-minute comedy that I do for The Producers or Blazing Saddles. The humor here is a little more restrained and subtle (not always, of course. The ""brain depository"" is just as outrageous as anything else). All in all, I like this movie for its humor, but I think I love it much more for its atmosphere, its heart, and Brooks' growth as a director.",Young Frankenstein

But this ""monstrous comedy masterpiece"" is anything but. Perhaps if I would have seen this in 1974 when it was released I would have enjoyed it more, but probably not because I was only 2.

191,stalzz64,A Classic Among Classics! One Of My All-Time Faves!,10,6 February 2007,"This is one of my favorite comedies of all time! There is nothing I can say about the writing, directing, acting that is negative. Mel Brooks is a comedic genius, and the 1970's were his 'golden years' of film making. (Actually go back to 1968 and the original 'The Producers') Gene Wilder stars in & co-wrote this film and 'Blazing Saddles', which were made within about a year of each other. Both are comedy classics! The late great Peter Boyle is a superb 'Frankenstein's Monster' and is so funny! The late great Madeline Kahn is wonderful as well. They are both Sorely Missed! R.I.P.! Another of my favorites of the 'Mel Brooks Stock Company' is Cloris Leachman.She is a scene stealer in this film as well as in 'High Anxiety'! 'Young Frankenstein' is a winner.Check it out if you are unfamiliar with the comedy of the great Mel Brooks.It's worth the time and effort.",Young Frankenstein
192,ericolsen1953,It's pronounced EYE-gor,10,29 December 2004,"Dialog from Young Frankenstein became part of cultural banter in a good many corners of the country immediately after this movie showed up in theaters. We loved every minute of it, ""Give me a hand with the bags, Igor"", hitting high singing notes while relating how your last date went, ""Put the candle back!"" ""Nothing, dear, just a rat....filthy, slimy RAT!"" ""Roll Roll Roll In The Hay!"" plus the immortal ""..an ENORMOUS schwanstucker!"". And what testosterone-filled 19-year-old buck didn't give serious thought to surprising his buddies with the hilarious trick of jamming a scalpel into this thigh? A very successful movie, and a slap in the face to those stuffy, elite- types who say Mel Brooks is not ""a humorist"". Well, dammit, he makes UNPRETENTIOUS people laugh, so perhaps the man knows funny when he sees it. Of course, as Blazing Saddles ruined most 1950's and 60's westerns for me for awhile, Young Frankenstein makes it very hard to take Karloff and all that bunch from the 1930's seriously any longer. Oddly, Mel can even make us laugh at resurrected, REALLY OLD gags; such as ""Walk this way!"" (The 3 Stooges). I'll never stop laughing at Young Frankenstein.",Young Frankenstein
193,quatermax-1,"'Pardon me boy, is this the Transylvania station?' 'Ya, ya. Track twenty-nine. Can I give you a shine?'",8,7 February 2008,"Gene Wilder plays Frederick Frankenstein, grandson of infamous monster-maker Victor, a brilliant neurosurgeon living in America and who is so ashamed of his ancestor's work he pronounces his name Fronkensteen. A mysterious visitor (delicately and delightfully underplayed by the great Richard (THE LOST WORLD) Haydn) arrives on the scene and informs Frederick that he has inherited his grandfather's estate in Transylvania.On arriving in Transylvania to claim his inheritance he encounters the hunchback Igor (Feldman), the voluptuous Inga (a never more alluring Teri Garr) and Castle Frankenstein's Mrs. Danvers-type housekeeper Frau Blücher (Leachman). Exploring the castle Frederick discovers his grandfather's old laboratory and secret library, which handily contains a book entitled 'How I Did It', and pretty soon the old Frankenstein family trait rears its ugly head, this time in the shape of Peter Boyle as the monster.Needless to say, being a Brooks/Wilder movie this isn't a straightforward Frankenstein monster romp, though it pays loving homage to the Universal Karloff movies of the 30s. Shot impeccably in black and white and borrowing its plot from 1939's SON OF FRANKENSTEIN, it becomes a case of 'spot the film reference'. Much of the laboratory's electrical equipment is that designed by Kenneth Strickfaden for the original 1931 FRANKENSTEIN; the monster stumbles across the shelter of a blind hermit (at the time a surprising appearance by ordinarily tough-guy Hackman) in an hilarious parody of the same scenario in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN; Kenneth Mars (THE PRODUCERS) recreates Lionel Atwill's role of the local Police Chief from SON OF complete with artificial arm into which he sticks his darts during a game with the young Frankenstein (as did Atwill), and who is concerned that this new Frankenstein may be 'vallawink in his grandvadder's vootshtaps  you know; Vootshtaps! Vootshtaps! '; Madeline Kahn's hair, after she is ravished by the monster takes on the same appearance as Elsa Lanchester's in BRIDE OF and there's even a scene with a little girl throwing petals into a well. When she runs out of petals she innocently asks the monster 'What shall we throw in next?' at which point Boyle's monster turns Oliver Hardy-like to the camera and smiles knowingly. Add to all this of course the Brooks/Wilder trademark gags: Igor's hump, which he denies having, keeps swapping shoulders; when his train arrives in Transylvania Frederick ask a passing shoeshine boy 'Pardon me boy, is this the Transylvania station?' 'Ya, ya, track twenty-nine' replies the boy, 'Can I give you a shine?'; to demonstrate his brilliance to the scientific community Frederick has his monster join him in a rendition of 'Puttin' on the Ritz' complete with cane, top hat and tails; a brain stored in a jar with the label 'Warning - Do Not Use This Brain' (which of course they do); horses whinny whenever Frau Blücher's name is mentioned, and Wilder's Frederick Frankenstein, with his pencil thin moustache and mop of frizzy hair, appears just as if SON OF's Basil Rathbone had stuck his fingers in a light socket.It's obvious from every scene that Mel Brooks has great affection for those old monster movies which results in this being the best thing he's ever done and, if I had one, it would certainly be amongst my all time top ten  just above BLAZING SADDLES. He also grants himself one of the best credit lines: Mel Brooks - Werewolf/Cat Hit by Dart.",Young Frankenstein

One of my top five movies of all time, I will never tire watching it. All Hail Mel Brooks !!",Young Frankenstein
195,elpaz79903,Comedy of Comedies,10,7 February 2006,"The best comedy from the mind of Mr. Mel Brooks and actors Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman. Young Fdrankenstein is by far THE Comedy Movie that will leave you laughing from start to finish and works whether you are five or seventy-five years old. The spoof of the Universal Frankenstein movies, fans will laugh as the Frankenstein Monster wreaks havoc in search for love and affection. It's funny when a young Gene Hackman lights the Monster's thumb instead of the cigar and burns his laps with the hot soup. Also, the name of the Frau making the horses nay and lightning strike and thunder is true comedy. In the end, this comedy gem is sure to make you a fan for this movie and any Mel Brooks comedy. The DVD version and recent VHS tape contains deleted scenes that were not in the movie or left out in the editing process, next time if it goes through the DVD treatment for anniversary should go ahead and put the deleted scenes into the movie. Go out and buy this movie or rent it, you won't be sorry.",Young Frankenstein
196,ShadySovereign,A classic comedy!,10,5 June 2005,"Young Frankenstein is one of the best comedy films I have ever seen. It is a really funny film, with many classic moments as well as jokes and gags. It can also be considered one of the earliest Spoof films (like Airplane!), since it spoofs the older Frankenstein films.One of the things that I loved about this movie is the way all the scenes were made. Many scenes are funny in an old-fashioned way, such as the scene where Inga (Teri Garr) is rolling in a wagon full of hay while singing ""roll, roll, roll in the hay!"" Other scenes can be a bit frightening, like the scene where the Monster is attacking the policemen in a stage-theater full of screaming people. Some scenes are extremely hilarious, such as the scene where the Monster burns his thumb and screams with his mouth open! Another thing I really loved about the movie is the actors & actresses' perfect associations with their character. All the stars were fit to play their roles in the movie, especially Marty Feldman as the creepy-looking-but-humorous Igor. Also, Teri Garr was gorgeous as the lovely blonde Inga. Kenneth Mars was pretty good as Inspector Kemp, too.The reason why many people have never seen Young Frankenstein is probably because they weren't too fond of seeing a movie without color, since the film was purposely made in black & white (even though the film was released in 1974, when Hollywood used color in movies). The film-makers made the film in black & white because they wanted the film to have a more ""classic"" feel to it. Plus, using black & white actually spoofs the older Frankenstein movies more. Also, I myself liked it in black & white.To sum up, Young Frankenstein is truly one of the best comedy (and possibly spoof) films of all time. It's a golden classic that will be remembered for years to come. If you haven't seen Young Frankenstein yet, I highly recommend it. P.S: Look out for a cameo by Gene Hackman as the old blind man who invites the Monster into his house.",Young Frankenstein
197,the-jerk,A Hilarious Homage to the Old Universal Pictures,10,15 December 2006,"I'm a sucker for comedies. It's with no embarrassment that I admit that comedy is my favorite movie genre and most of my favorite movies are comedies. What's more, when evaluating how good a comedy is, I give more weight to how funny it really is, rather than how well-acted or well-directed or even (much of the time) original it is. If it makes you laugh, then I feel it's done its job, and that's what matters.I'm simply saying all this because ""Young Frankenstein"" is not simply one of my favorite comedies ever; it is one of my favorite movies ever. I wrote a comment about ""Blazing Saddles"" where I mentioned the fact that it came out the same year as ""Young Frankenstein"", and both movies had the same director (the GREAT Mel Brooks) and the same star (the INCOMPARABLE Gene Wilder, also co-writer). They also happen to both be among the funniest movies of all time, which is an incredible achievement.Between the two, I give the edge to ""Young Frankenstein""; it's my favorite among Brooks's movies, and second only to ""Airplane!"" (by those other founding fathers of the spoof, Zucker Abrahams and Zucker) on my list of greatest comedies of all time. And this movie IS well-acted, well-directed, and (in its way) original. In fact, there's much to love about this movie besides how funny it is. But it also happens to be side-splittingly hilarious, and that's what gives it the edge over other comedies.The cast is led by Gene Wilder, who plays Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced FRONK-en-steen, so as to differentiate himself from his infamous grandfather). Frankenstein is a serious scientist who never went for his grandfather's kooky theories about reanimating the dead and resents the connection people make upon hearing his name. But when he finds out that his grandfather's castle has been left to him in his will, he is forced to take a trip out to Transylvania. In Transylvania he is met by Igor (who prefers to go by the pronunciation ""Eye-gor"", but obviously only to mock his boss). Igor is the descendant of the original Dr. Frankenstein's servant, and comes to serve Frederick while he's in Transylvania. Played by Marty Feldman, he's the only character who seems fully aware of the goofiness all around him; he is comic relief in a movie that is already a comedy. And with those unbelievable eyes, all he had to do was look at the camera and he could get a laugh. RIP, Marty Feldman.Frederick also meets hot-blooded Inga (Teri Garr putting on a ridiculous German accent; hands down the best thing she's ever done PERIOD) upon his arrival, and they head to the castle where they meet Frau Blucher, the caretaker. Frau Blucher is played by Cloris Leachman, who of course is always funny. This sets up one of the best running gags in the movie; every time someone says her name, the horses whinny.At first, Frederick resists his grandfather's research. But after Inga wakes him up from a nightmare, they hear violin music, and find a secret passageway that leads to the original Frankenstein's laboratory. On the way down they also run into Igor, but don't find out who was playing the violin (which they do find, unattended and still warm, along with a smoldering cigar). They do, however, find Frederick's grandfather's notes (including a book titled ""How I Did It""). Reading these notes, Frederick decides that bringing life to the dead could work after all, and sets to work digging up corpses and sending Igor for a brain (he breaks the one he was supposed to get and picks up an abnormal one instead). And so Frederick, Igor, and Inga set to work on their grand experiment.At first, it doesn't seem to work. But when the creature does finally come to life, it's a crazy monster. It escapes, the townspeople (led by Kenneth Mars as Inspector Kemp, and he is hilarious as usual) want to kill it, and they have to get it back.As I'm writing this, it is three days past Peter Boyle's death, and this is a pity. The world will be a bit less funny without him. He was pitch-perfect as the monster, making it every bit as much his own as Boris Karloff did in the original. He commented once that this was his favorite part of his. His ability getting laughs with just some exaggerated movements, subtle facial expressions and groans was without peer, and the bit where he and Frederick are on stage singing ""Puttin on the Ritz"" is among the funniest scenes in movie history.The cast is rounded out by Madeline Khan as Frederick's virginal fiancé Elizabeth. Madeline Khan was an extremely funny woman and although she doesn't have much screen time in this movie, she makes her time count. RIP, Madeline Khan.And Gene Hackman must be mentioned as well. I've always been a huge fan of Hackman's, and although his cameo as the blind man isn't his best part ever, it is his funniest, and makes for some of the funniest bits in the movie (""Come back! I was going to make espresso!"" he yells out as the monster runs screaming from his house).What makes this movie work so well is that it almost seems to take itself seriously. It has an original plot that pays homage to the original Universal pictures with nearly every scene. It's shot in black-and-white, and everything, including the haunting score, Gothic cinematography, and set-pieces, many of which came from the original pictures, is meant to evoke Frankenstein movies of old. It's this hushed level of reverence to the originals juxtaposed with the hilariousness of the script and over-the-top performances of the actors that really sets this movie apart. It is a work of genius in every way.RIP, Peter Boyle, Oct 18 1935 - Dec 12 2006.",Young Frankenstein

199,souther02,"""It's Alive""",10,17 December 2010,"The film is a wonderful love story, complete with a seven-foot tall(I think) re-animated monster, a half-mad neurosurgeon with just a small income, Frau Blucher(whinnying horses), a little guy who likes to make jokes of everything(even within the script), of course Dr. Frankenstein(Gene Wilder), and the Dr.'s enormously attractive assistant Inga. Inga is played by Teri Garr. Teri Garr looks terrific in gorgeous black and white. I actually had a hard time following the movie because I've always been in love with Teri Garr. She wears I think eight or ten different dresses or outfits. The remastering of the movie is outstanding.In the beginning of this famous Mel Brooks flick, Frankenstein, son of THE Frankenstein, is a rather crabby and exasperated man, his own nemesis in a way because he doesn't want to be compared to his father. But after finding the laboratory in the old castle(ran by Frau Blucher), he becomes a different person, a different scientist. He longs to re-animate flesh, in addition to having a desire to jump Inga's bones. The feeling is mutual. Back home, wherever that is(never read Shelley's book) is his fiancé, a woman who makes the Doctor wait until their wedding night. Her name is Elizabeth(Madeliene Kahn) and her parents are rich. She is somewhere between a very slowly melting iceberg and a haughty tease. But she catches Igor's eye(both of them belonging to British actor Marty Feldman). Which is very incidental, however the little guy does make a go of it, making light of it all the while. Igor's big mission is going to the brain depository in the little German town. I wondered today why the good doctor did not go, but it's one of many things that one finds at the local library when not searching for early Stephen King books. Those old Boris Karloff and Peter Cushing movies are a trick to find; I used to stay up late when I was a kid to see them.Inspector Kemp(played by Kenneth Mars) has problems himself, but he never died and was brought back to life. He is mostly mechanical above the waist. He also has an a way of expressing himself that apparently means he had some neurological speech impediment. Which is funny as hell, in the movie. Sometime during the movie Frankenstein asks Inga to elevate him, where that goes you know, if you have seen the movie. The monster, disturbed by fire during a performance for the town, gets Elizabeth to go out to the country with him. He now has fire under control, and Elizabeth finds out after another cigarette that The Monster is the most gifted man in the world. She says ""seven has always been my lucky number.""After some schnapps the think tank goes back to the lab, and something miraculous is about to happen.",Young Frankenstein

While Brooks's later movies have a deplorably high ratio of groans to laughs, virtually every joke in this movie works flawlessly.

202,charlywiles,"""You take the blonde and I'll take the one in the turban!""",8,27 February 2016,"This is a hilarious spoof of the ""Frankenstein"" films, with a fun cast and a delightful script. Marty Feldman as ""Eye-gor"" is sidesplittingly funny, Peter Boyle is perfect as the monster (zippers & all), Cloris Leachman is a delight as ""Frau Blucher"" (horses beware!) and Madeline Kahn is wonderfully wacky (and drop-dead gorgeous) as Frankenstein's (Gene Wilder's) intended. The film is not only very funny, but in a way it also pays homage to the original Universal films. The original laboratory equipment was used and, like those films, it is filmed in wonderful black-and-white. Come to think of it, ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935) was so wonderfully over-the-top that it was funny in its own way. The scene in this film where Boyle as the monster meets the blind hermit, played by an originally unbilled Gene Hackman, is a comic highlight (""Where are you going - I was just going to make some espresso!""). Feldman practically walks away with the film, however. All I have to do is look at him with those wonderfully skewed eyes (Wilder - ""Damn your Eyes!"" Felman - Too late!"") and his marvelous expressions and I just loose it. Just check out his antics in front of the circuit board during the ""transference operation"" - goofy and hilarious! According to Mel Brooks, they had to film take-after-take of the scene in the castle courtyard where Feldman meets Kahn for the first time because of his slapstick (biting Kahn's fox fur, etc.), which put Wilder in hysterics each time. In this scene that finally made it into the film, check out Wilder - he's practically biting his lip to keep from laughing! This film may not quite be in the same league as ""The Producers"" or ""Blazing Saddles,"" but it comes awfully close. It was funny when I saw it at the theater as a teenager in 1974 and it still cracks me up!",Young Frankenstein

204,kdryan,Abby Someone... (Spoilers),9,15 August 2001,"""Best Ever"" is a phrase that has been tossed around so much these days that it really has no meaning.  I like to try in my life to give descriptions of things without resorting to cliche, but here it is just impossible.  So you don't think I'm gushing, there are two moments in the film that I feel fall flat, but that will be described later.  This wonderful film is without a doubt my favorite comedy ever, bar none.  Is it any wonder it is listed every time someone starts ticking off Frankenstein films? 
Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Terri Garr, Peter Boyle, and all the rest of the cast are wonderful actors and for Wilder, we must (quietly!) enter the realm of genius.  But Marty Feldman is the person who made this movie the delight it is.  In almost every scene he is in, he steals it with such enthusiasm it makes you wish he had made many more films.One of the two places I spoke of earlier is the Transylvannia Station scene. I just don't think it's relevant enough for many people to get in this day. For those who don't know, it's a reference to the immensly popular (in the forties) song ""Chattanooga Choo-Choo"" with it's line ""Say little boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo-Choo?"" and it's reply ""Track 29, oh and would you care for a shine?""The other place is stage show with The Monster dancing and singing ""Putting on the Ritz.""  Fans generally throw tomatoes and say nasty things about me when I say this, but I really feel it falls flat and is only there for an excuse for The Monster to be captured by the authorities.  As I think of it though, I am hard pressed to say what COULD have replaced the scene though, so...So, for a good time that you shouldn't take too seriously, throw this movie in, sit back and laugh your rear off when you hear ""HE VAS MY BOYFRIEND!""",Young Frankenstein

I love 'em all. Every time I see this movie, there is something that I find to delight over that I may have overlooked.Madeline Kahn singing 'Oh, sweet mystery of life' after being 'taken' by the monster is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a movie. I love Wilder's turnabout when he's in the locked room with the monster, screaming to be let out. Marty Feldman doesn't even have to say anything to be funny but when he does, it's priceless - 'What hump?'.You could almost do a 'Rocky Horror' participation with this movie as so many lines are memorable.The only thing I would gripe about is sometimes Wilder's histrionics can go a little too long and become tedious which is a shame because he is so good at subtlety and has a natural laid back personality.This is one of those movies like Victor/Victoria which I wish I could have been a stagehand just to be around the fun.

207,jonandshellie,Quite possibly the most perfect film,10,29 December 2008,"From the opening homage to the Universal classic monster films to the final frame as we pull away from the castle Frankenstein with Igor sitting high up on his windowsill playing his horn you can't help but be enthralled by this film. With ""Young Frankenstein"", Mel Brooks managed to combine, in perfect symbiosis, the romance and intrigue of the classic black & white Universal monster movies of the 1930's and 1940's with the shtick comedy that made Brooks famous.With the script, Gene Wilder managed to write something not only witty and amusing but rife with the old-world nostalgia that made the original Universal monster films so appealing. The film itself is ageless - shot beautifully in black & white, and similar to holiday classic ""A Christmas Story"", it is difficult to pinpoint an exact date that the film takes place thus allowing the film to lend itself to several time-periods.The comedy, although a bit campy at times, is effective in it's execution and works very well with the dark, Victorian setting of the film. Gene Wilder is superb as Frederick Von ""Fron-ken-steen"" the brilliant neuro-surgeon and grandson of Victor Von Frankenstein. His charm, sharp-tongued wit and comedic timing really is a study on the craft of acting in itself. The supporting cast of actors are wonderfully cast and compliment each other perfectly, with the late Marty Feldman stealing the show as Dr. Frankenstein's loyal but slightly defiant assistant Igor.Although Young Frankenstein hasn't managed to find itself on the top of many top ten film lists, it is no doubt one of the greatest films ever produced and a joy to watch over and over again.",Young Frankenstein
208,Jared9001,A subtley funny gem of a classic.,8,28 July 2017,"Young Frankenstein is macabre genius. The performances in this movie are odd and brilliant, from the townspeople and constable to Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman (both of whom absolutely steal the show), with really odd, strange, dry-yet goofy humor pushing the story along beautifully. My favorite part of this film is it's premise. The idea of Dr.Frankensteins grandson going mad following in his footsteps is a very original one, and I really enjoyed it. It's also one of the first movies in a long while that I can tell went over my head. Very few of the jokes are delivered in a way where it's obvious that they're jokes, they kind of just fit into the movies overall conversational tone between characters; the best example of this being Igor, whose presence in the movie is absolutely fantastic. The biggest problem for me, and I'm aware that it's a personal problem, is that when a joke is too obvious, I feel like it kind of breaks the tone that was already established, and therefore it doesn't get a laugh out of me. I also feel as if the monster is maybe introduced a tad too late, and I'd like to see more of him in the film as he is very entertaining. However, this is all really negligible. This is the type of spoof movie that all others should try to imitate, subtle and original, and able to stand up on its own without having much prior knowledge of the original, and is entirely worthy of its classic status. 8.8/10",Young Frankenstein
209,BatmanAndRobyn,Hilarious film!,8,16 October 2013,"Having previously seen the original 'Frankenstein,' I figured that it was time that I check out this film to see what it's all about. Thankfully, my roommate had it readily available.With all the corny humor in this film, Brooks could have easily done a sloppy job with the editing and camera work, but the cinematography is actually really well done. Similar to the 1931 film, the low angle shots and harsh lighting throughout the film were absolutely fantastic. I found myself in awe of some of the shadow work present in some scenes. As usual, Gene Wilder never fails to disappoint. His performance as Dr. Frankensteins grandson is the perfect amount of crazy. Marty Feldman was probably my favorite character in the film due to all of his witty one-liners and overall persona. It was also really interesting to see Peter Boyle as Frankensteins monster. I've seen him in other films different from this one and I thought he pulled off the role of the monster wonderfully.It's a really excellent film.

But to rate this movie anything below a 9- its like saying Alfred Hitchcock doesn't know horror.Maybe because my father was a fan and passed it down, i was able to understand all the jokes. Spaceballs, although perhaps my favorite, is by no stretch a funnier movie. History of the world, young Frank, BLAZING SADDLES? all gold.

A young college professor, who is haunted by his family's past, has just inherited his Grandfather's estate and ends up following the footsteps he tried to hide. Young Frankenstein was released in 1974 and is a parody of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, directed by Mel Brooks and written by Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks. The cinematographer was Gerald Hirschfeld. John C. Howard did the film editing, and the lead roles in the film were Gene Wilder, Peter Boyle, and Marty Feldman.
In this movie Frederick Frankenstein is faced with the past of his grandfather when he inherited his land....and his laboratory. Once his finds this out he decides that he too will try to reanimate life like his grandfather once did. Once he has done this the creature has motives of his own and wants to go off to live life and not be kept up in the castle or killed by people in the town.
I love this movie and have problem seen it a dozen time each time, I being a little older realizing another joke in the movie. I first watched it at a young age and did not understand many of the jokes at all but upon further viewings I found myself laughing more and more. Every joke in this film is done perfectly, from delivery to the picture and the sound to let the joke breathe for a second.
This is such a good parody, along with brilliant acting and direction and it is comedic gold. Everything was put together so well in this movie for a great, fun, and silly movie. Movies like this are great because it is meant to be a sit back and enjoy it is supposed to be funny. It doesn't try to sell itself as something serious and come off just being dumb. This movie puts a smile on my face everytime and just make me forget about the surrounding world to watch Igor's hunch switch sides.
Nothing in this film seems too out of place, there are some things that are meant to be funny but that is being it is a comedy so they contribute to the film in the best way possible. When we are meant to see certain things the camera doesn't move towards them but the characters look at them and then we see what the characters think about it. There are a few times when the camera has a zoom in but that is for a character reaction as well and to let us see something.
One of my favorite parts of this film is one the movie poster when Frankenstein and Igor are walking down the street with the cart when it breaks and then the police officer shows up. This scene was done perfectly, it starts with an open view of the street that the two characters can see then the cart breaks and you can see where the cart broke and then the police officer's view of the scene. It is a little dark in the scene because they are outside at night but you can see everything that you need to. It is all put together for a very memorable comedic bit.",Young Frankenstein
214,olivery2k,Good Movie,7,28 February 2002,"This movie was very good. The comedy wasn't stupid, and the language wasn't bad......I just wish it could have been a little longer. I really loved this movie. It was cool.",Young Frankenstein
215,tylergee005,Extremely disappointing,6,19 May 2017,"I was so excited to see this coming on TCM since I've wanted to watch it for years now. I really do love Mel Brooks and his type of humor, but unfortunately this movie didn't work. I genuinely laughed only at one part, and the rest was really a drag, a bore, a film I actually was not entertained throughout. I wanted to like this film a lot, I thought it could be my new favorite comedy, being with the premise and director and cast and all, but I was let down with this one.",Young Frankenstein
216,SteveM-1,IT COULD WORK!!!,10,10 February 2018,"...and it most certainly does work. Rightfully hailed as Mel Brooks' greatest work, this film is a master class in both comedic story-telling and cinematography. There isn't much that hasn't been said about this film already. Every aspect of this film, from the acting to the set design works so well. The comedic timing is spot-on. The insistence on filming in Black & White was a master stroke as well. I think in order to really appreciate this film, you have to go back and watch the original Frankenstein films from the 1930's. Particularly the first three films starring Boris Karloff as the creature. Once you compare the scenes in those films to Young Frankenstein, you see that this film is not merely a farce, but a Valentine to the old classic films. I saw Young Frankenstein first, long before i got to see and appreciate the original films. I was very surprised how much of YF was a take on the previous films. I didn't know about the ""brain dropping"" scene or the artificial arm of the Police Inspector. After comparing the two films, it becomes evident that the best satire comes from somebody who truly admires the source material. I've read some poor reviews on this site regarding this film, and can only conclude they come from younger viewers who have never seen or compared the source material. It is a shame that most classics like this are lost on younger generations, but, thankfully, these generations have little say in what is truly a classic. Highly recommended. To get the best experience, I recommend Blu-Ray. Enjoy!",Young Frankenstein
217,daitran199980,People's tastes of comedy nowadays are different from me!,4,28 November 2015,"4 months ago, I watched ""Blazing Saddles"" of the famous director Mel Brooks because I saw the positive reviews from many people for that movie with the sentence: ""The best comedy of all time!"". After I had watched it, I didn't know why they love it. It's not funny, it's really stupid.Today, I saw Young Frankenstein in my watch-list and I decided to enjoy it. I thought I would waste my time for this film because I saw the name of the director of this film, Mel Brooks, and I remembered that I've seen one of his terrible film, ""Blazing Saddles"". After that, I realized my feeling was true: It's really bad.In the beginning of the film, I liked it, it described the landscape of the castle, too dark. And I like the way they used the color black-white of the film. My feeling was growing up until I realized the half part of the film was passed but the character Frankenstein hadn't appear yet. After that I saw the little journey of Frankenstein, and I think it's too normal, it's not special, that I can see in many other movies. In the scene that Frankenstein was kept in the prison, I saw the stupid love story of Dr Fronkensteen, why could he be happy when his friend could die? In the most of last scenes, there are too many love story and I don't know that what did I watch? Comedy? Horror? Or Romance? I am very disappointed!So I don't like this movie, Blazing Saddles, Holy Grail and Life of Brian that aren't funny, they are really stupid!",Young Frankenstein
218,ericsinla,One of the best comedies ever!!!,10,19 January 2002,"For some reason I never get tired of watching this movie.Mel Brooks first movie "" The Producers"" may be more original and his others may have more one liners, but there is so much to see in ""Young Frankenstein."" that it stands out from the rest. The great sets, the black and white photography, and the perfect comic cast make ""Young Frankenstein"" not only one of the funniest movies ever made but also one of the prettiest. In 1974 very few directors were shooting in black and white, Mel Brooks may have been the first to try something like this and the results are amazing...consider it was also a smash hit in 1974.  Of course it is a parody, which for the rest of his career may have not have served him as well. Some may disagree, but with ""Young Frankenstein"" we get a little more than just a parody. It's more like an homage thats still hilarious. Theres an affection in this movie for its material thats rarely found in comedy/parody. As comedies go ""Young Frankenstein"" up there with the best.",Young Frankenstein
219,drebin73,Gene Wilders triumph,10,21 February 2006,"Gene Wilder will be known as two people Willy Wonka and Dr. Fredrick Fronkonsteen. Marty Feldman will be known as Igor and Teri Garr will always be known as Inga. This is probably Mel Brooks' best picture. Blazing Saddles is nothing compared to this comedy farce. A lot of the credit goes to Gene Wilder who wrote a majority of the script. This is one of Mel Brook' only pictures in which he does not appear himself. Mel Brooks is great comedy director and this is proof of it. He has created the most quotable movie ever. This movie stares Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Kenneth Mars, Cloris Leachman, Peter Boyle, Gene Hackman Teri Garr and the late great Madiline Kahn. This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. The greatest moment in film/comedy history is the classic Puttin on the Ritz scene. Can you believe that Mel Brooks protested this scene. The DVD has an funny commentary track by Mel Brooks an interesting documentary and some funny deleted scenes. The movie is great the actors are great the DVD is great the whole thing is great. This movie is funny from beginning to end. 10 out of 10",Young Frankenstein
220,rogapol,It's a cliche to say but it's a Classic,10,31 October 2020,"I saw the funny side of this as a youngster but it also scared me a bit too....big monster, mad scientists, buldgy eyed helper, shot in B&W, etc
Fast forward 40 years later it doesn't scare me anymore but the lines are still funnier than ever and I see more.
Marty (Igor) made me laugh everytime he had a line!",Young Frankenstein
221,potter-4,Fun for all.,8,12 January 2004,"This movie was a laugh-fest. If you know anything about the early days of the horror genre, or the story of Frankenstein, this movie will tickle your funny bone. One of the funniest scenes, in my opinion, is when the monster comes upon the blind man (played by Gene Hackman!) and has a meal' with him. The black-and-white photography is also a treat! I recommend this timeless classic for all the ages",Young Frankenstein
222,ccm043,Very funny movie,7,9 June 2004,"To me, this film is not laugh out loud funny.  It's more Gary Larson funny, where you look at a picture, and even though you don't physically laugh, inside you can't control the hysteria.Still, I can't help but feel that I would find this film better if I had actually seen some of the classic horror films (in the same way that Blazing Saddles would be better watching westerns, or Airplane! would be better watching the '70s airplane disaster films).True, some of the jokes are few and far in between, but there are so many that still make me laugh.  The best jokes are the ones that keep you laughing, even after you've seen them a hundred times.  The monster is well played by Peter Boyle, and even in a Mel Brooks comedy, you can feel true sympathy for him.  I think this is Brooks' most serious comedy (who says comedies can't be serious?).  Some of the references are a little obscure, but they don't detract from the movie overall.  Good accomplishment.  7 stars.",Young Frankenstein

MMMMMMM!",8,25 June 2004,"If somebody asked me which three videos I'd want if I weremarooned on a desert Island, I'd have to say ""Monty Python and theHoly Grail,"" ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein."" Can'tdecide which of the two Mel Brooks films I like better becausethey're both fantastic. Brooks doesn't hold anything sacred in hisclassic spoof of 1930s horror flicks. Marty Feldman steals theshow as ""Eye-gor,"" Starting with the scene where a wolf howls inthe background and somebody says ""Werewolf?"" ""Where?"" Martypoints and says ""There! There wolf, there castle!"" Also, where heconfesses that the brain he took from the lab belonged to ""Abbysomebody."" Gene Hackman as the blind hermit and the scenewith the monster and the little girl on the seesaw just had mecracking up.

224,royals794,"""My name is Frankenstein!"" - One of the funniest films ever made",10,21 June 2008,"In 1974, Mel Brooks achieved one of the greatest feats in cinematic history: he gave the world two comic masterpieces in ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein"". Both are two of my favorite comedies of all time, but I would put ""Young Frankenstein"" slightly ahead, if not just for the fact that you can watch it fifty times and not tire of it. I have seen it a dozen times, and I laugh harder each time I see it; I used to laugh at the jokes, but now I laugh even harder at the anticipation of each line. Gene Wilder is perfect as the wild-eyed, half-crazed Dr. Frankenstein (that's Fronkenshteen) and Marty Feldman is hilarious as his sidekick Igor (that's Eye-gor). Each scene is a little gem unto itself, including a heartfelt goodbye at a train station, an exploration into Dr. Frankenstein's library (in which we see the hilariously simple title of Frankenstein's book), the monster's encounter with a blind man (a hysterical Gene Hackman), and a classic song and dance number with Dr. Frankenstein and his monster. Young Frankenstein is filmed in beautiful black and white and the jokes will have you laughing nonstop. Check this and ""Blazing Saddles"" out to see why Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder are considered two of the funniest men on the planet. A perfect 10/10!",Young Frankenstein
225,RufusT,Absolutely hilarious!,10,8 January 1999,"Without a doubt, one of the funniest (if not THE funniest) movies of all time, with Wilder (whose idea was the genesis for the project, not Mel Brooks as is often indicated) and Brooks at the very top of their form.EVERYTHING works in this movie, from the writing, directing, acting, sets, lighting, camera work, you name it, an absolutely on-target spoof/tribute to the James Whale Frankenstein films of the thirties (though the plot resembles SON OF FRANKENSTEIN more than either Whale picture).By all means, see it!  See it a dozen times!  I've seen this movie at least 2 - 3 times a year and it still never fails to make me laugh out loud.  The best!",Young Frankenstein
226,herzograven,Laughter promised - one of the best comedies I've ever seen,9,27 February 2002,"Funny as hell, especially if you understand German. Even if you don't, you will still laugh like you're crazy cause the movie is just too damn funny. what I recommend is, that you watch the original Frankenstein and Bride Of Frankenstein with Boris Karlorff, then it'll be even more fun to watch. DON'T miss it.  Laughter promised - one of the best comedies I've ever seen",Young Frankenstein
227,sumocat,"See this movie or it's the ""glue factory"" for you!",9,11 September 1999,"A humorous twist on a classic horror flick. This is Mel Brooks at his comedic finest. You didn't know that Mary Shelley was a comedy writer? Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder knew. How else could they have written such a brilliant screenplay?This is not mere sarcasm, but pure genius, blended with tongue in cheek jabs at everything from medicine, religion, politics, and Hollywood horror, to sex and marriage. Nothing is sacred, and Wilder and Brooks pray (prey?) at that alter often.How would our PC society view Gene Hackman's performance as the ""blind man' today? His character is hilarious.What about Kenneth Mars as the police inspector? He does for amputees what Hackman did for the sight impaired.Unless your cravenly PC and/or Humor challenged, you must see this movie, twice, as you will be laughing so hard you will miss things the first time around.(I saw this on the big screen with a rather dense classmate in high school, and I had to pay to see it again because I missed so much explaining all the sight gags and such to him.)On second thought, maybe the PC should be made to view this film in it's uncensored entirety, as well as other Mel Brook's gems, to give them a reality check of their funny bones.

I love the character all over again, and that goes to the monster as well. the word play is hilarious and the sexy scenes are rather taste full. this is a grade a comedy that I plan on watching again, and have. they literally take the most famous movie monster and put him through the most random of situations. one second he is tape dancing in a suit the next hes speaking long elegant words of the doctor.",Young Frankenstein

231,mrushkoski,A Movie Behind its Time?,8,3 May 2018,"Young Frankenstein was one of those 1930's films that seems to grasp the type of comedy that only that of Gene Wilder can create...except it was made in 1974! Originally filmed for black and white the cinematographer Gerald Hirschfeld, wanted to give the audience the feel of being in the 1930's. The film captured this by not only originally coming out in black and white but also doing full black fade outs in between scenes and1930's style of opening credits, a rarity for the 1970's. It was amazing to watch a ""talkie"" comedy filmed as if 30 years older. I believe that in todays Hollywood, filmmakers rely too heavily on special effects and less on the magic of what the film could be.",Young Frankenstein
232,psoftinfo,More homage than comedy,5,16 December 2001,"I'd heard for so long that ""Young Frankenstein"" was a must-see movie that when a commercial-free station aired it, I made sure I taped it. However, halfway through viewing it, I stopped the tape and went off to do something else.  A little later, I watched the rest of it out of what I can only call a sense of duty.The 1930's feel was well done. The acting was also good (Gene Hackman was superb, as always). Teri Garr was so beautiful I found it hard to breathe. So there were many reasons I should have given this movie a rating better than 5.  However, the movie simply failed to make me laugh.  I don't think I even cracked a smile.In fact, while watching the movie I had to find ways to amuse myself.  For example, after the first Frau Blucher/horse joke, I knew it would be a running gag, so I tried to predict each time it would be inserted.  I nailed most of them.If this movie deserves an ""excellent"" rating, it must be because (as some have remarked) it treated the mythos with care and respect.  However, since I've never been a fan of the Frankenstein films, I could only assess it by whether or not it made me laugh (which was the reason I watched it in the first place).  Unfortunately, it didn't elicit any mirth.This may be just the right movie for you, but I wouldn't watch it again.",Young Frankenstein

235,Kanadiz,Mel Brooks's finest hour!,8,25 May 2008,"The first Mel Brooks film I've seen was 'Space Balls' which I pretty much enjoyed, but I had no idea he was capable of creating such comic brilliance.The first time I saw this film was when I was living in my apartment in downtown Toronto a couple of years ago. It was a Saturday night and I had no plans and this was before I had gotten a roommate. So I went over to the nearest Blockbusters and looked for a couple of classics. I ended up renting 'Five Easy Pieces' and 'Young Frankenstein' and it ended up being a pretty good night since I had three important ingredients, pizza, beer and a barrel of laughs.I love the way Mel Brooks tackled the original James Whale classics (Frankenstein from 1931 & Bride of Frankenstein from 1935) which are in my opinion the greatest monster classics ever to be put on screen.This film looks so authentic that it actually feels like a 1930's monster film, except of course for all the comedy. It has everything it needs to make a perfect classic comedy work: A terrific performance (Gene Wilder), a hot babe (Teri Garr), the creature himself (Peter Boyle) and one of the funniest characters in motion picture history, Igor which unlike in the original is pronounced Eye-Gor (Martin Pidman).The story begins when Fredrick Fronkensteen (Gene Wilder) gets a visit from a strange old man who brings him the will of his great grandfather, 'Baron Bofort von Frankenstein'. He then of course goes to his great grandfather's old castle which actually looks exactly like the castle in the original picture from 1931 because in fact it is a picture of the castle from the original film.He there meets the care taker of the castle named Frau Blücher (Cloris Leachman) in which she is so creepy that every time her name is said, the horses begin to whinny. Now that is very funny. At first he doesn't want to face the facts of his grandfather's work but when he finds his grandfather's secret library and starts to read his books he figures it out: ""It could work!""So of course he walks in the foot steps of his grandfather and sets out to create the creature. As told by his grandfather's books, the creature must be of gigantic stature, everything must be increased in size and of course then, ""he would have an enormous schwanstugel"" in which I-Gor replies, ""he's gonna be very popular!"" But of course the creature doesn't set out to be as smart as they anticipated and this obviously leads to bigger laughs, like when he visits the blind man played brilliantly by Gene Hackman.I watched this film again last night with a good friend of mine and who happened to be a fan of Mel Brooks. I guaranteed him a great time and believe me he wasn't disappointed. It was just as great for me as it was the time I saw it, if not better, It's one of the best American comedies of our time.",Young Frankenstein
236,Spiner-2,Highly amusing!,8,22 June 2001,"A co-worker lent me his DVD of ""Young Frankenstein"" after hearing, to his disbelief, that I had never seen it. (Actually, as I watched it, I realized I HAD seen parts of it before, but never the whole thing.) While I would hesitate to agree with the tagline's claim of it being ""the funnies comedy of all time,"" the movie was undeniably hilarious.Gene Wilder did an excellent job in his convincing portrayal of the grandson of the original Dr. Frankenstien, and Peter Boyle earned our empathy and laughs as the monster. Extremely funny performances were put in by Marty Feldman (Igor), Teri Garr (Inga) and Kenneth Mars (the inspector). Madeline Kahn (Elizabeth) wasn't as funny as she was in ""Clue"", but she played her part well.Some of the funniest moments: the moving hump, the werewolf scene (""There, wolf.""), the doctor and Inga find the secret passage, sedative charades, the horses' fear of Frau Blucher, the inspector's mechanical arm, the monster's visit to the blind man, and Elizabeth meets Igor and Inga.Definitely worth seeing!",Young Frankenstein
237,ColbyDMay,THE Definitive Mel Brooks Masterpiece,10,12 October 2000,"Many people think different things of Mel Brooks' work; those people also differ on their opinions of which of his films, brilliant or otherwise, were the best.  My personal favorite is Young Frankenstein, as it is not only a send-up of old black-and-white horror films, but also a tribute, with its wonderful photography, authentic scenery, and the actual laboratory equipment from the original Frankenstein movies.  Gene Wilder is without a doubt a national treasure, one of the greatest (if not the greatest) comic actors of all time, and his portrayal of Dr. ""Fronk-un-steen"" is masterful. No slam on Mr. Brooks, but this is one of those films that are better for his acting absence; it is evident that this was to be his masterpiece, and he wanted only the best in front of the camera.  Better than ""High Anxiety"" by a nose, this film certainly deserves mention on any comedy top-ten list that might come down the pike.",Young Frankenstein
238,seaj11,the best kinds of comedy,10,20 September 2003,"""Young Frankenstein"" is a compendium of all kinds of comedy: farce, satire, and parody.  Brooks places less emphasis on farce and more on parody.  Igor (Marty Feldman) consistently plays on words (""Werewolf? Where wolf?""), Inga (Terri Garr) refreshes the meaning of common expressions (""What big knockers!""), and Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman) is an icon of insider jokes.  Gene Wilder portrays the sexier mad scientist, wooing his teasing fiancee (Madeleine Kahn) and humoring his not-so-quick lab assistant (Garr).  Satire is the subtler comic element.  For example Constable Kemp's (Kenneth Mars) mechanical arm is one of many remarks on ""improvements"" in medical care and technology (the brains deposit box!).As a whole, ""Young Frankenstein"" is the epitome of a comedy. The humor is well crafted, and invigorated by the talents of Wilder, Kahn, Garr, Feldman, Mars, Leachman, and Gene Hackman in his brief scene.  A scary comedy, a sexy monster film, and unexpected.",Young Frankenstein

The cast of characters was fantastic. Who could beat Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, etc. as an ensemble. Hardly a moment went by when I didn't laugh out loud, or should I say scream with laughter. The scenes got funnier and funnier as the movie progressed. Gene Wilder's expressions were worth the price of admission alone and his interaction with Madeline Kahn was priceless. The scenes which were comedically based on the original ones from the Frankenstein series of movies were the best, my favorite being the one with the monster going to visit the blind man in the woods (cameo by Gene Hackman) and the other with the wonderful Madeline Kahn singing ""Oh, Sweet Mystery of Life."" The entire audience was rolling.Of course, Kenneth Mars and Terri Garr also did great jobs, adding to the film immensely. I had to go back the next week and see it again with another friend who I knew shared my crazy sense of humor. She sat there laughing so hard that tears rolled down her cheeks and she kept saying ""I can't believe this"" over and over. To this day, my friends and I quote lines from this film which has become a cult classic. I know every line in the film and when a group of friends and I get together every so often to view it, we all start laughing before the funny parts even happen because we know what's coming.In my estimation there never was nor will there ever be a film anywhere near as funny as Young Frankenstein.

243,Elle Jay,Hmmm...,9,21 July 2003,"I think, after reading through the previous comments on this film, that Mel Brooks' two forrays into comedy in 1974 were deliberately intended to appeal to two completely different audiences.  It is true, as so many previous reviewers have stated, that some were disappointed in 'Young Frankenstein', as they had expected another 'Blazing Saddles'.  However, it is clear that they are very different films; Blazing Saddles is in-your-face, childlike slapstick, while Young Frankenstein is more reserved, thoughtful and subtle. Both have managed to retain enormous appeal over the last 30 years, and for this reason alone Mr Brooks should be commended.  On a personal level, I prefer Young Frankenstein.  The use of language is brilliant, and the acting is superb (particularly Marty Feldman's visual comic genius and Gene Hackman's excellent, unexpected cameo)  A real credit to Brooks and his team.",Young Frankenstein

248,Steve-219,The Eyes Have it!,10,15 January 1999,A wonderful parody of the 1930s classic horror films.  Lovingly recreated laboratory sets (using some of the props from the original Frankenstein movies) and marvellous use of black and white film.Great ensemble performances by all the lead actors - especially Peter Boyle as the Monster; and wonderful use of close ups and wide eyed facial expressions so reminiscent of the silent movies and early talkies.  The haunting music theme repeated throughout the movie fits the atmosphere very well.The collaborative rapport between Director Mel Brooks and screenplay writer/lead actor Gene Wilder is very evident.One of the few movies that I could see every month for ever.,Young Frankenstein

And mayhem and creation ensue.This movie is so great on many levels and gets better with each viewing.I watched this movie 6 nights in a row and loved it. Oh and to those who say the new generation doesn't have taste in movies,you're looking at a thirteen year old who adores old school Mel brooks. Even the most hardcore Horror fans will get a kick out of this movie.This is in my Frankengroovy collection(along with rocky horror picture show) the one thing i wish they hadn't done was use Jesus' name in vain. But even that is used in a funny context. You will laugh your butt off at Marty feldman,snicker at Frau Blucher(Neighh)and have your heartstrings tugged by peter boyle.

The jokes are lame as hell, the script pathetic, the only funny thing in it is Marty Feldmans eyes and they hardly deserve 10 out of 10. It just amazes me how this film picks up these great reviews despite the fact that it stinks so much.

254,mikeslant,Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder have done it again!,10,3 March 2003,"From ""The Producers"" to ""Blazing Saddles"", it seems that when Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks do a movie together your bound for a good time (Even though Wilder only starred in those other two films, he had nothing to do with the screenplay). I am a huge Mel Brooks fan. I love ""History of the World Part 1"", ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"", ""Blazing Saddles"", this film, and to a lesser degree, ""Spaceballs"" and ""Dracula:Dead and Loving It"". I have warped sense of humor, and it shows. But this film is hilarious, but you can tell that this was more of a Wilder written film. Throughout it lacks the potty humor and off-color humor that have been constant in other Brooks films. It has some, but it has a little bit different feel to it than other ones. Yo u will find no sign of the p*** boy of ""History"", or the racial jokes and gags found in that same years ""Blazing Saddles"". But this is a time period when Brooks was at his finest, two of his best films, many call them his two best, came out the same year (1974) and they have become his two most successful films, both critically, and finanically. Actor wise, Peter Boyle is hilarious, his grunts and crazy looks always seem to come at the right times. The character Igor (""it is pronounced I-gor, master"") is my favorite, because of his eyes and remarks. Gene Wilder is good in this film also, he also comes off with some very funny looks. Madeline is funny and witty as she always is in Brooks films. (She also appeared in Mel's ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""History of the World"", to name a couple)And Gene Hackman, he may have had a small (or should I say blind?) part in this film, but it was one of the funniest sequences in the film. I could hardly stop laughing when he was ladeling the soup for Peter Boyle. Overall, this film is a deffinate 10 out of 10. It has to be on my top two or three list for Mel Brooks films. It may even by number 1, I dont know, I just know it is funny. A must see. ***** out of *****",Young Frankenstein
255,Spaceballs,Comedic Genius,10,4 July 2002,"Mel Brooks' tribute to the Frankenstein movies of the 40s is done with such love, such skill, and such side-splitting, fall-on-the-floor hilarity, that it has rightfully become a comedy classic. I first saw it in a movie theater: I had no idea what it was, had very little knowledge of Mel Brooks at the time, and expected to be bored. Instead, I found myself shrieking aloud with laughter that became so intense, I missed many of the major lines. Hence the video.What can I say? From the wild-eyed Igor, the hunchbacked Transylvanian servant whose hump keeps changing from side to side, to the modern-day descendant of Baron von Frankenstein, determined not to follow in his great-grandfather's nefarious footsteps, to the nurse, a naif with enormous...er...chestal appendages, to the fearsome Frau Bleucher, whose mere mention causes horses in the castle's faraway stables to neigh in fear...to the scene of the monster and his creator singing and dancing in black tie to ""putting on the Ritz,"" this movie should come with a warning: ""Danger--Uncontrollable Laughter May Become Chronic.""The cast is beyond superb. The late, wonderful British comedian Marty Feldman (Igor), who turned his congenital wandering eyes into comedic foils, never misses a beat as second banana to Gene Wilder, who plays the distraught Dr. Frankenstein to the hilt and beyond. Cloris Leachman, who looks like a cross between a witch and a warlock, plays the feared housekeeper Frau Bleucher (neighhh!!!), and a very young, beautiful, and buxom Teri Garr plays the nurse-assistant to the good doctor. Then there is the marvelous Madeline Kahn, who gave a bravura performance as the doctor's fiancee. The late comedienne's burst into operatic ecstasy during her rape by the monster is simply inspired, and is one of the comedic high points of the entire film. All of Kahn's considerable talents came into play during this movie; she was taken from us too soon.",Young Frankenstein
256,DommyCommy57,"Ah!, Sweet Mystery of Life",10,10 April 2005,"Young Frankenstein is the classic of all time classic comedies. Mel Brooks directed, in my opinion his masterpiece of all his films. Filmed so beautifully in black and white. Gene Wilder is so sensational as Frederick Frankenstein and Madeline Kahn is once again so incredible as ever as his fiancé Elizabeth. I wish the film would have been in color just to see her beautiful red hair shine. Peter Boyle is wonderful as the monster. Marty Feldman as Igor is phenomenal. Cloris Leachman is hysterical as the housekeeper Frau Blucher. Kenneth Mars is great as Inspector Kemp. Gene Hackman has an uproarious cameo as a blind man and Teri Garr is very sexy and funny as Inga, the doctors assistant. The whole cast is outstanding. Not many films have a unique cast in one great movie.Anyone who has seen this film knows all the classic lines. Mel Brooks is getting ready to bring Young Frankenstein to Broadway as a musical, he may strike gold with it and probably do a film of the musical, but it can never be as good as this gem. The DVD is great to own and has lots of extras and some facts about the making of the film. One for instance is that Teri Garr got the part of Inga, because Madeline Kahn was offered the part first but felt the smaller part of Elizabeth was better for her. It was a far smaller role, but she put her stamp on it and stole every scene she was in. She should have been nominated for another Oscar for this role and could have one it too. That is the only one thing about the film that does bother me, that she is in only a few scenes, but when she is on screen its pure magic. She is so sexy and passionately funny in every word she speaks.",Young Frankenstein
257,clawpack,Simply wonderful,10,1 June 2005,"This is an absolutely delightful movie that's as fresh and funny today as it was when it was released more than 30 years ago. It's ostensibly a parody of the 1931 classic Frankenstein movie and its many sequels, but even someone who is only vaguely familiar with the Frankenstein story can thoroughly enjoy this movie.The film features talented performers at their absolute best. Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks wrote a script filled with funny lines and situations. Wilder also plays the title character and delivers a performance full of manic energy. Marty Feldman (Igor) provides a delightful insouciance as the world's happiest hunchback. Special mention needs to be made of Peter Boyle, who was cast as the monster. Playing a mute creature in a bulky costume, Boyle must do much of his acting with only his eyes, and he effectively conveys an endearing bewilderment in the powerful monster. The scene where the monster visits a lonely blind man (played by Gene Hackman) is as funny as anything I've seen in a movie.Young Frankenstein isn't quite perfect. Wilder and Brooks have said in interviews that they weren't sure how to end the movie, and in fact the characters stray far from their established personalities to fit in some gags. That violates a rule of comedy, that the gags must fit the characters and not the other way around, but by the time this happens, the movie has built up so much goodwill, it is easily forgivable. I loved this movie, and anyone who doesn't love it is no friend of mine.",Young Frankenstein
258,echo_valley26809,Great movie,9,23 February 2006,"Yet another spoof movie, this time about Frankenstein. Or, rather, Fronkensteen.The movie starts off with Fredrick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) being willed his great-grandfather's castle. Frankenstein begrudgingly takes a trip to visit it, though he wants no part in his ancestor's crazy scheme in re-animating the dead, and he constantly denies his heritage. It is only after he finds an old notebook detailing exactly how to re-awaken the dead that he believes it might be possible. That's when the movie takes off. Each scene becomes more hilarious than the last one.Frankenstein has enough meat on it to make fun of. A mad scientist resurrects the dead with his hunchback assistant? Seriously. The challenge wasn't making the movie funny. The challenge was making it funny while not making it too over-the-top. Although stories that focus only on humor can work, and have on many occasions, the general story of Frankenstein has too much plot for it to fit well here. And that's what Mel Brooks did. He focused on the plot and stemmed the humor from there. It works beautifully.From Fronkensteen to Eye-gor, and everyone in between, Young Frankenstein is one of the funniest movies around.",Young Frankenstein

260,Face_teh_Dark,"""It's pronounced Fronkonsteen!""",8,23 February 2006,"YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN A Mel Brooks comedy Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has spent his life trying to live down the bad reputation of his name. When he inherits the castle of his infamous grandfather, Victor Frankenstein, he changes plans and decides to make grandpa's dreams come true. Working after Frankenstein Sr.'s notes, Frederick sets out to create life in his laboratory. If only his assistant Igor (hilarious Martin Feldman) hadn't screwed up by stealing an abnormal brain for the monster...Mel Brooks truly is the king of spoofs. With SPACEBALLS, he spoofed the entire STAR WARS trilogy, while still managing to write a coherent plot into the comedy. HIGH ANXIETY faced the hard task of spoofing Hitchcock, one of the most revered directors in film history, and succeeded brilliantly. Even the misfired Dracula: DEAD AND LOVING IT had some clever stabs at the vampire genre.YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is not as much of a spoof as it is an homage to the classic '33 horror film. Shot in black and white, with amazing cinematography and gorgeous set design that perfectly captures the spirit of FRANKENSTEIN, the film is great to look at as well as hilarious.Gene Wilder is solid as Frankenstein, but it's Martin Feldman who steals the show as the hunchbacked assistant, Igor. His wild facial expressions and memorable lines (""what hunch?"") make him one of the funniest characters you're ever likely to see on film. The most classic gag in the film might be Igor's ""walk this way"" pun at the train station. Kenneth Mars is also a treat as the armed and dangerous police inspector Friederich Kemp.Overall Mel Brook's movie is solid, beautiful to look at, consistently funny and definitely worth a look. 8 out of 10.",Young Frankenstein

Of course, it's not as funny as the classic 'Blazing Saddles', but it runs a close second.  But what makes this film stand out is the comedic genius of Gene Wilder.   Wilder lets himself go in this adapttation of the classic horror tale, and he is complemented by the zany cast(did I just say zany?), Marty Feldman, Madleine Khan, Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr, and Peter Boyle.

Some years later, I no longer laugh as hard at Young Frankenstein, but I still love to watch it. I attempted to show it to some of my friends who weren't too amused by it, but the fact that it's humor is more subtle than more modern comedies is the basis of it's appeal to me. It's kinda like the three stooges. Most jokes don't warrent more than a slight chuckle, but it's still amusing and you're not laughing so hard that you miss the next joke. Yes, there have been better comedies, but there have been more worse than Young Frankenstein than better.

I barely laughed at all during this film yet the vast majority on this site seemed to be rolling on the floor with tears pouring down their eyes from start to finish. So it seems I just have a different taste in humour, I don't know...My favourite comedy movies are Life of Brian, Naked Gun, Top Secret, The Holy Grail, Airplane, Shaun of the Dead, Some Like it Hot, Dr Strangelove...do I differ so radically from other's tastes? Anyway, taking the humour aside ( which is difficult, as it's a comedy film...hence my low score! ) it's hard to fault the performances or production. The film looks wonderful, the acting is superb throughout and it's obviously been done with a lot of heart and effort. But the corny, staged jokes and slapstick humour barely raised a giggle from me so it has to go down as a failure in my eyes.",Young Frankenstein
271,bfprower,Mel Brooks' Finest Film,10,8 April 2011,"Young Frankenstein stands above other parody comedies because it makes sure that the humor is not the center of the film. The film makes the jokes a subtext to the story, characters and the atmosphere. The humor is executed trough these elements, and it not only makes the film hilarious, but also compelling, polished and memorable. The film stars Gene Wilder as Frederick Frankenstein, the grandson son of the original Frankenstein, who his highly skeptical of his grandfather's work. He journeys to Transylvania after inheriting his family's castle and eventually becomes his grandfather's successor. The story follows closely to the original Frankenstein and some of its early sequels, and it works just as well as the humor. The film could almost work as a drama as well as comedy. Gene Wilder gives a spectacular performance as Frankenstein. Wilder specializes in acting as eccentric brilliant psychopaths with a strong sense of charm and morality. He performed perfectly as Willy Wonka in 1971 and does the same here. Marty Feldman plays his loyal accomplice Igor, easily the funniest character in the film. Feldman manages to make Igor fun and innocent, yet takes him just seriously enough so he doesn't lose his credibility. Peter Boyle plays the monster, whom he gives a layer of playful innocence to accompany his enormous, powerful and frightening demeanor. It'll take forever to cover the entire supporting cast, yet they are all spectacular. The film is completely shot in black and white and successfully recreates the horror atmosphere of the films from the 1930s. The art direction makes the setting creepy and dark, yet lighthearted at the same time. The films humor is difficult to describe but it's a good balance of physical, verbal and story-centric comedy. The film doesn't go out of its way to be funny and the humor never feels campy or over the top. The laughs are evenly distributed and properly delivered in all three acts and the film never feels lopsided; something that a majority of comedies, even the most acclaimed, often suffer from. Young Frankenstein is simply a film where everything works, and it works really well. For any fan or comedy or horror, Young Frankenstein is a must watch.",Young Frankenstein

It is so good that my kids enjoy the film as well. It is hard to believe that this movie has been around as long as it has.

But its brilliance lies in its script, star actors, and Mel Brooks' best direction ever.Gene Wilder, who co-wrote the screenplay with Brooks, is ideal in the title role, using his manic energy and slightly crazed look to optimum effect. And what an amazing cast of supporting characters: Peter Boyle as the monster, wildly funny (and touching!) with almost no dialogue; Marty Feldman as Igorwas anyone ever more perfectly cast in a comic role?; Cloris Leachman, brilliantly over-the-top; Madeline Kahn, capping her run of great comic roles (What's Up, Doc?, Paper Moon, Blazing Saddles) with what I consider her best. Plus good work from Kenneth Mars, a young Teri Garrand let us not forget the best star cameo ever put on film  Gene Hackman's uproarious turn as the blind man.Can you imagine a comedy this good being released today? I can't. They'd probably show it to a test audience that would bitch about the (wonderful) black-and-white cinematography and insist that the monster have hard-drinkin' sidekicks.So many wonderful moments, it's almost impossible to pick a favorite.

282,dsax-3,Great comedy,9,29 March 1999,"I loved this movie.  It has everything that you have come to love from Mel Brooks.

283,vertigofan,A career high for Wilder and Brooks...,10,17 February 2001,"...and that's meant as a compliment!  This brilliant satire may not be quite as hysterically funny as ""Blazing Saddles"", but is certainly a more complete film.  The whole cast is on absolutely top-form, from Kenneth Mars' hilarious Inspector to Cloris Leachman's creepy Frau Blücher to Gene Wilder's superb turn as Doctor ""Fronkonsteen"".  And Marty Feldman, Teri Garr, Peter Boyle and Madeline Kahn are fantastic, too - but I have a word limit here!The cinematography is superb, and the controversial choice of black and white (in 1974) really helps the simultaneous homage to/skewering of the old Universal horror movies.  The addition of the original Frankenstein (1931) lab equipment to the already great sets is merely the icing on the cake.Mel Brooks also turns in a career-best directing job.
Highest possible recommendation, especially if, like me, you are only now discovering the wacky world of Brooks/Wilder through DVD.  Woof! 10/10",Young Frankenstein

But now that I'm a bit older and am fully capable of understanding the satiristic elements and humor that this movie offers, it's become my favorite. My personal favorite performance is the cameo by Gene Hackman. The entire ""blindman"" scene is terrific and still gets me cracking up everytime. This movie is a must-see for all the other Mel Brooks fans out there. Once you see it, you'll never forget it!",Young Frankenstein

Best comedy ever made.  From a time when Mel Brooks made movies which were funny.  More than a spoof of Frankenstein movies, this is a homage which captures the atmosphere perfectly.  The brilliant cast includes Peter Boyle as the Monster, Terri Garr as Inga the lab assistant, Marty Feldman as Igor and Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth.  Top honours go to Gene Wilder as the mad and incredibly sexy Dr Frankenstein.  How he never won an Oscar is beyond me.Favourite lines include: ""Put the candle back""; ""Frau Blucher""; ""What exactly is it that you do do?""; and of course the whole ""Putting on the Ritz.""The DVD version contains a lot of extra features which are well worth seeing.Ten out of ten.",Young Frankenstein

Gene Wilder, Terri Garr, Marty Feldman(R.I.P.), Peter Boyle(R.I.P.) and Madeline Kahn(R.I.P.) are all hilarious in this film. ""Bleucha!"" is a running joke in my family so is practically every quote in this film.I can't get enough of this film. Gene Hackman has a small cameo in a ten minute scene where he plays a blind man who takes in the monster at one point. Even though he's uncredited, it is possibly one of his most memorable roles. It's impossible to not laugh in that scene.I grew up with this movie. I will keep watching it, and show it to my kids when they're able to watch it.10/10 stars.

Marty Feldman is perfect as Igor.,Young Frankenstein
289,Magic610,Rolling on the floor laughing!!!,10,3 November 2002,"I absolutely love this movie! Mel Brooks at his finest!

Gene wilder was an excellent guy for the part of young Frankenstein, ""its not Igor its EYE-gore"" i greatly enjoyed this movie, and all my friends say it is a superior, fun, fast based comedy movie. My favorite scene would be when the inspector goes to play darts with young Frankenstein, and he pegs the car with something like twenty darts. Second favorite scene is when the inspector finds young Frankenstein robbing the grave",Young Frankenstein
291,realart,Hilarity Personified,10,23 January 2000,"To truly appreciate this film you HAVE to have seen FRANKENSTEIN, BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and SON OF FRANKENSTEIN. Otherwise much is going to be lost on you. Brooks and his team obviously went to much trouble to document what they were spoofing. An example: when the monster meets the blind hermit (my favorite sequence) the way he grasps the cigar looks, on the surface, rather phony - just a way to setup the monster's thumb for the punchlione. But in the original BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN that is exactly how the monster picked up the cigar. Obviously people were attending! Combine the original Kenneth Strickfadden laboratory equipment, superb writing and an equally superb cast and you have something that will live as long as the classics that inspired it. Oh yes - to quell an urban legend - ""Blucher"" does not mean ""glue"" in German. According to Brooks, the name was just made up. German for glue is leim, kleber, klebstoff, leimen, warmleim and many more - but nothing like bleucher.",Young Frankenstein

He hit that low in 1974 with Young Frankenstein. Usually once in a Mel Brooks movie, I get a good belly laugh in, but this just missed the mark on all attempts. It just wasn't funny. I mean the feeling of the old movie and the settings were technically perfect, but it doesn't hide the fact that wasn't amusing in any respect. While watching the movie with friends, chuckles and a solitary ha were heard in the first 45 minutes, after that, silence. The movie at this point, doesn't even try to be funny. It's just stuff happening. If I just want to see stuff happening, I'll watch Seinfield. Anybody thinking about buying, renting, or borrowing this movie should really think hard if they want to waste 106 minutes of their lives they'll never get back. Don't see it. It's not funny.",Young Frankenstein

If that fails to make you laugh you're probably in need of some uppers.The movie is just filled with funny scenes and dialogues, too many to mention; Frau Blucher and the horse, the police captain with the fake arm and the darts game, the cardboard castle shots with lightning and dramatic music.Wonderful humor for the sake of humor, but artistically done. In a class of its own.",Young Frankenstein
294,jh_gifford,In the Top Ten FOREVER,10,30 August 2001,"I'd be hard- pressed to say anything original regarding this film.  It is arguably Mel Brooks' funniest movie-- and definitely in the Top Ten Forever, including Blazing Saddles and The Producers (both also Mel) and Capra's Arsenic and Old Lace. What new film aficionados should do is make the effort to see the 1931 Frankenstein and the 1935 Bride of Frankenstein and then watch this one again.  It's even funnier when you get more of the subtle jokes-- NO SPOILERS.  It's Brooks' best creation of a comic ensemble, and the production makes the black- and- white seem truly alive. This Hallowe'en, detour from splattered coeds and see the greats. ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" are 2 of them.",Young Frankenstein

But-I really think to more fully appreciate this picture, anyone seeing it for the first time,should rent the original Boris Karloff movie AND ""Bride Of Frankenstein"". After seeing these two, ""Y.F."" seems even funnier!",Young Frankenstein
296,andre.cox@csfb.com,Seen it over 30 times,10,4 August 2003,"Funnily enough when I first saw Young Frankenstein, I wasn't too impressed. Then I saw it again and again and again. This film contains some of the best comedy sketches and one liners/catch phrases than any other film I know. Though there are more hilarious scenes in Blazing Saddles, more clever wit in the Producers, Frankenstein wins over all, it has a better screenplay, is better acted and is still unbelievably funny to boot. Marty Feldman as Igor, was a master stroke and most certainly was funnier here than any film (or TV show) he had previously done, and Gene Hackman has still never been funnier, even though it was played so straight. This was Mel Brooks (and Gene Wilder - who co-wrote the screen play) at his best, humor generated by circumstance and character contrast, none of over the top, predictable humor of the Farrelly brothers (not unfunny- just not that cleverer (sic))Note: I saw this back to back with the original Frankenstein, in this context the film is even better.",Young Frankenstein
297,chocoHB,Greatest Comedy of All Time?,10,2 September 2007,"""Young Frankenstein"" is truly the greatest of all parodies of all time and one of the best comedies ever made. Mel Brooks & Gene Wilder are at their best with excellent support from Marty Feldman, Teri Garr, Madeline Kahn, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, Kenneth Mars, and so many other character roles that are just as memorable and seemingly innumerable.Even without seeing the original ""Frankenstein"" and the ""Son of Frankenstein"" starring Boris Karloff, this movie seems to gain in its timeless quality as the years go by from its release. Of course, ""Young Frankenstein"" does get much funnier when you see the previous Frankenstein movies including ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein."" If you have seen any Mel Brooks movies, he loves to appear in them. As he has made more and more movies, he cast himself in larger roles and then starred in them. (My favorite is ""High Anxiety."") I'm impressed with Mr. Brooks that he realized his appearance in this movie would not add to it. Still, his comic expertise and timing are showcased here better than any other Mel Brook film. His collaboration with Gene Wilder's original idea shows each man applying their comedic arts at their peak.Gene Wilder plays our hero, Froedrich Frankenstein. At the beginning of the movie, there several subtle hints that he's not a ""good"" guy. The best, quiet example is ""Give him an extra dollar"" for the supposed medical volunteer. Then, Froedrich begins his transformation, from pseudo-con-man wanting to cash in his inheritance to mad scientist to sacrificing himself for a greater good. This is a classic comedy with the happy ending in a Shakespearean tradition.Of course, what makes these comedians, Brooks and Wilder, shine is the supporting cast. Without Garr, Feldman, and Leachman, Froedrich's metamorphosis would not occur or make sense. Teri Garr's Inga's accent makes so many of her lines as very funny punchlines. ""Oof."" Marty Feldman's I-gor is so adorable and plays to the audience emphasizing the parody aspect. With every scene he appears, you expect and receive a joke. After watching Cloris Leachman in the movie, you just want to go around saying, ""Frau Blücher"" hoping to hear the reaction.The film does contain three additional jewels: Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman. Kahn, as fiancée Elizabeth, is absolutely hilarious as a sex-pot of a woman who uses sexuality to get what she wants and who becomes the best ""bride of Frankenstein"" ever. Mars' Inspector Kemp is the kooky character that is so strange everything he does has a comedic effect. Finally, Gene Hackman, as the blind hermit Harold, is just precious with his monologue played off the Monster (Peter Boyle).I have mentioned just a few highlights of a great comedy that plays upon our society's collective knowledge and fear of a Frankenstein monster. Please watch ""Young Frankenstein."" Enjoy, Laugh, and Smile.",Young Frankenstein
298,bill-1820,Be ready to split your sides,10,25 January 2014,"I think this is Mel Brooks' greatest achievement. He captures the spirit of the 1930s and 1940s black-and-white horror films, adds a great many laughs, and yet it remains almost as much a tribute as a spoof. Young Frankenstein (the character) is grandson of the notorious Baron Victor von Frankenstein. A serious doctor, he refutes his grandfather's work as the mad dreamings of a ""doodoo"". Yet he is drawn inexorably in to the family heritage with hilarious results. Gene Wilder, who co-wrote the script, is excellent in the title role with excellent support from all the main cast. The result somehow manages to be both almost believable and also ridiculous. In my opinion 40 years after its original release, it remains one of the funniest films ever made and is definitely not to be missed.",Young Frankenstein

Am watching it tonight in 2006 on cable after having not seen it in years. Right now, the most amazing thing is the pacingneither too fast to comprehend nor too slow to savor. It allows the essence of Shelley's basic Frankenstein story line and Brooks' humor (both collective and a series of incomparable one-liners) to sink in. The talent is consummate. I've rated this film an ""8"" simply based on its farcical nature; however, it truly is the most wonderfully enjoyable cult film that I've ever seen. One can practically memorize the script's entirety. I highly recommend it and am overjoyed that YF still appeals to today's teenagers. Its powers are both curative and inspirational.

Yes, a knowledge of the original Frankenstein movie does make it more enjoyable and, yes the ending is way over the head of 5 year old but, this movie fills the narrow gap of ""something for everyone"" in a way that no other movie does.Read the other highly touted reviews (some are really good) but, if the day ever comes that you are stuck with your large, multi-aged family in your house during a snow storm with the cable out, do yourself a favor, have this film on hand.

It holds up no matter how many times you watch it. It holds up no matter how much you study movies. It holds up no matter your age.

It combines the classic black and white melodrama of the early days with a satirical treatment and not-so-subtle humor that is capable of amusing many future generations,even if the younger generations don't fully understand the historical references. Fabulous cast including what I consider Gene Hackman's best role (first-timers, see if you can spot him). There's not a single actor in this movie that doesn't produce an Oscar worthy performance. Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder were always most brilliant when collaborating - The Producers has experienced far more commercial success in recent years with the Broadway musical and remade musical feature film.

314,amberbamber47,Young Frankenstein,10,3 January 2008,"What do you think of when you hear the name Frankenstein? Do you think of a big scary ugly man? One who everyone is afraid of? Well if that is true then I would have to say you would be somewhat right, but at the same time wrong because Frankenstein was not the monster's name. The inventors name was Frankenstein. It's funny that a lot of people get that mixed up, simply because every movie of Frankenstein was about a huge ugly monster that everyone hated, but in reality it was more about the scientist brings dead tissue back to life. At which he succeeded. This brings me to the movie Young Frankenstein. Young Frankenstein was directed by Mel Brooks who was famous for many funny as well as great films. This film was made to be a great film to add along with the other great Frankenstein films but unlike the others this one is not just about a dark and gloomy world where everyone is set out to kill the beast. Although this one is very similar it was made to make people laugh more than cry. Young Frankenstein starts out with the grandson of Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein trying to live down his grandfather's name. He doesn't speak of his grandpa or anything. He would just like to forget. Because he thinks he is nothing like him. Well turns out he has to return to Transylvania to his grandfather's castle. He gets there and is met by his grandfather's most humble houseboy Igor and his sexy assistant Inga. As well as his mysterious housekeeper Frau Blucher. Victor had always thought his grandpa's experiments to be impossible but he instantly changes his mind when he finds a book of all his grandpa's notes and experiments. He slowly begins to try to reinvent his grandfathers experiments he follows each step in chronological order. All it really took was a trip to the lab and a trip to the cemetery to get it all started again. Mel brooks did a fantastic job with this movie because it made us laugh when we would usually be offended and it was still more then just funny, it captured all the different genres of the movie as well as making it funny to watch and entertaining to see. A lot of the credit for that goes to the performances of Gene Wilder, as young Frankenstein, and Peter Boyle as the monster. They act broadly when it's required, but they also contribute tremendous subtlety and control. Boyle somehow manages to be hilarious and pathetic at the same time. Mel would do things in the film just to do them, for example, there were a couple of bloopers that were found in the movie but noticing them in the movie kind of in a way fit to Mel's style in directing. All in all I would say this movie deserves a 10. I say this because the acting was tremendous and the scenery matched exactly as it should for a movie taking place when it did. It was touching, hilarious, scary, and fun all at once!!! I think that almost all the movies by Mel Brooks deserve a 10 just because he makes every film into a masterpiece whether or not it's a parody of another film he still knows how to make it wonderful!",Young Frankenstein
315,MotoFilm,The Evolution of Comedy,10,8 June 2017,"Every time I watch this film, it takes me back to a time when modern comedy was just being established. Mel Brooks took this well-known story and built a light-hearted series of references and stereotypes to form a fun and exciting tale that had only been shown as dark before. By introducing this new type of comedy in this era, it opened up a massive surge of the same types of comedy that we see in films today.

322,raghoo1019,funny.........but could have been better,6,14 January 2005,well I saw the movie after great amt of review readings...but found the movie funny in bits and pieces only. some of the potential funny incidents fell flat like when Elizabeth says do you want me to elevate you here in the laboratory....and then the situation ends with oh that switch....really could have been much better. However some of the clips of Igor were really funny...like the way he first asks Gene Wilder to walk like this with his little stick...but to add to the humor they could have made the initial part of Dr. Frankinstein in color...anyway the movie could have been better. The sounds were a bit blaring here and there but the suspense was well depicted.,Young Frankenstein
323,htrain,Logical Explanation of how Mel Brooks Movies are Funny: Young Frakenstein,10,21 April 2005,"The only people in my experience that rate Mel Brooks movies comparatively low are those who have only heard about the movies. The tiny percentage of the haters who actually view the movie and dislike it do not have a good grasp of the subject material in the movie. I suppose that this is my main point. If anyone takes anything from my commentary, this is it: To truly enjoy a Mel Brooks spoof, you must have a good knowledge of the subject material being satirized.Mel often includes little things in the movies that you may not notice unless you have, say, actually read Frakenstein or seen one of the movies that it has spawned.One closing comment: No one can deny liking ""Puttin' On The Ritz"". Period. :P",Young Frankenstein
324,guitarozone,very funny,10,30 June 2005,"I love Mel Brooks and this movie is one of his best. For me it ranks right up there with Blazing Saddles and Robin Hood Men in tights. The characters in this movie are some of the best comedic performances I have ever seen. My favorites would have to be the monster or a very young Gene Hackman as the blind monk, I laughed so hard at the monk and the monsters scene I nearly woke up my infant son. I recommend this move to anyone looking for one of those movies that will hurt your sides and make juice fly out of your nose.p's. I would buy it now that I rented it, I suggest you all do the same cheers",Young Frankenstein
325,erichgt,Classic Mel Brooks,9,11 October 2015,"Even at has worst Mel Brooks is one of the funniest writer/directors ever to exist and Young Frankenstein is far from his worst. A hilarious comedy of errors and misadventures it keeps the viewer in stitches from start to finish. Almost endlessly re-watchable and it never ceases to be totally hilarious. A beautifully balanced cast of actors lead by the venerable and talented Gene Wilder keeps the classic comedy moving along perfectly from start to finish. Worth every penny this movie simply must be in any collection worth having, because what's movie night without a little Mel Brooks in the mix.",Young Frankenstein
326,star_the_hedgehog,I absolutely adore this movie!,10,18 October 2005,"This movie is incredibly entertaining. Mel Brooks & Gene Wilder created a truly magnificent film! I think it's great that the creature became smart & nice in the end. The original ""Frankenstein"" was sad. Elizabeth was such a snob! Madeline Kahn was a fabulous actress! If you've ever seen ""Blazing Saddles"", another Mel Brooks film, then you've seen her act as a woman directly opposite of that, & you truly know just how good she was. There are times when Gene seems to be overacting a bit, but it seems that way in all the films he does. This really suited ""Froderick Fronkensteen's"" character. Marty Feldman was extremely entertaining in the role of ""Igor."" He's a comedic genius. This was an amusing, & wonderful film, which is why I give it 10 stars.",Young Frankenstein
327,ducky-38,Funny film,8,18 November 2005,"I love this movie. It's funny and well made and was done at a time when Mel Brooks was at the top of his game, instead of later, when he did terrible movies like the Robin Hood one or the bad Dracula movie (trying to duplicate the success of Young Frankenstien with disastrous results).Brooks takes scenes from some of the original Universal movies and spoofs them well. Marty Feldman was at his best as Igor, the assistant with the moving hump. And of course Gene Wilder was great. It's a wonder he and Brooks didn't do more stuff together in the 70s and 80s, they seemed to have worked together so well in the projects they did work together in.Great movie.",Young Frankenstein
328,uksnake007,Give it the credit it deserves,10,12 December 2006,"I have never written a review before and I am afraid this is not much of one, but I just had to comment on the other appalling wright up this got. This film is a classic and make no mistake about that. And that is why it is in the top 250 films of all time. I watched this with my 16 year old son last night. It was his first time and I have watched it many times before. He laughed a lot and gave it a ten out of ten. The other night I watched 'Date Movie' but it could have been any of the rubbish comedy's that are produced in abundance today. Young Frankenstein beats them all hands down. It is brilliant and so is Gene Wilder.",Young Frankenstein
329,sfbullfrog,"Better than any of the ""Scary Movie"" take offs out there",10,3 April 2006,"If you have seen ""Frankenstein"", ""Son of Frankenstein"" or ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", then you will enjoy this movie. Shot with many of the same props and locations, it is one of the best satire movies I have seen. The comedic talents of Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Teri Garr, Madeline Kahn and Cloris Leachman have never been showcased better. And the running gags are hilarious. It is probably my all-time favorite movie. While serving in the desert, I watched all the old time Frankenstein movies, and then watched this again. An excellent way to spend time. My wife complained that it was in black & white, but I explained that it wouldn't have been as funny in color.Watch it sometime",Young Frankenstein
330,thanhtoo-38584,"Genius Mel, love you, may you live 200 years",10,16 October 2020,Mel is a true genius. Love this movie having watched it over 100 times over 20 years. It never grows old. The science is still relevant. Man will reanimate life one day but why only for the super rich? This movie was the highlight in my freshman years and will still be the highlight in my twilight years. Bless Gene and Marty for their brilliance but gong goes to Mel,Young Frankenstein
331,johnsoul,Huge hand a real hand?,10,27 May 2006,"Here is a very obscure trivia question for any and all. There is a scene where Gene Wilder is transporting a corpse on a wagon. He get's caught holding one of the body's hands when a constable stops him. The hand is huge. Pretending it is one of his own hands is part of the humor of course. Does anyone know if that hand was some huge actors real huge hand? Of course it could have been a prop. But it looked so incredibly real. It appeared to be flexible like a real human hand. I wondered if they hired Andre the Giant or someone to provide that hand! While the rest of him was hidden of course. Does anybody know if if it was a real or fake hand? Hmm, I have to fill this up to ten lines. OK, the constable asks Wilder ""Do you need a hand."" Wilder replies, ""No thanks, got one."" At one point he manages to salute the constable with this huge hand.",Young Frankenstein
332,thedakr,A good show gone awry at the end,3,21 October 2006,"Young Frankenstein is full of hilarious quips and fun one-liners. The movie leads the audience along a fun, slap-sticky road. UNTIL the humor turns completely sour!!! Once the movie moved to showing Frankenstein (the monster) and his new would-be bride actually consummating their odd marriage (though one sees only the monster's back), the movie shot right out of funny to completely off color (no pun intended for the black & white feature). The movie's real intents seems, from this point on, to be the female climax as brought on by the size of the male's anatomy. Didn't people grow out of finding this humorous in middle school (if not earlier)? Simply put, the movie took a terrible turn from good-natured, slap-stick to inappropriate slap-'something else'.If you are looking for a recommendation, I would suggest you watch something else, the end isn't worth any of the jokes in the rest of the show.",Young Frankenstein
