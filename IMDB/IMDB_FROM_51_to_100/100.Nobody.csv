0,SnoopyStyle,Jimmy doing John Wick,6,17 April 2021,"Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) is Nobody. He is a suburban family man doing his boring job in a non-eventful routine. One night, two masked people break into his home. His son tries to fight back but he puts a stop to it. He loses the respect of his son and others. Non of them knows about his secret violent past. When his daughter is missing a bracelet, it's the last straw and he tracks down the robbers. His path collides with a brutal Russian mobster.This is Jimmy trying to be John Wick. I don't think Odenkirk is the John Wick type. He's not quiet enough although he tries in the opening. He has a comedic energy that is vibrating to get out. The action is not quite as cool although there is plenty of it. I do not like the Home Alone booby-traps in the last part. Overall, it's an interesting attempt. I like it enough. It's good popcorn waster but it's unlikely to lead to a John Wick style franchise.",Nobody
1,boblipton,The Man With Something Extra,7,11 July 2021,"Bob Odenkirk spends his weekdays commuting to a a dull job. Tuesday mornings he always forgets to leave out the trash. Wife Connie Nielson is always asleep when he climbs into bed. Weekends are a blank. One night he wakes up to finds housebreakers. He lets them rob him, despite his son's also waking and trying to stop them. When they've gone, he tries to return to his routine. When his daughter can't find her kitty-cat bracelet, Odenkirk tracks down the housebreakers. On the way home, he puts half a dozen obnoxious teens in the hospital. One of them, however, is the brother of a Russian mobster. Of course, Odenkirk turns out to have a skill set that makes Liam Neeson look like a wimp.I've noted elsewhere that comic performers have the same acting ability as straight performers, and something extra. That's what Odenkirk brings to this movie. He's utterly believable as the dull routiner. He's utterly believable as as the guy whose job is to make sure there are no witnesses. As straight as he plays it, there's a manic energy to the proceedings that others in this genre can't match. With Christopher Lloyd and RZA.",Nobody
2,Prismark10,Nobody,6,12 June 2021,"Given it stars Bob Odenkirk. You would think that Nobody is a dark comedy drama.With writer Derek Kolstad involved who is better known for the John Wick movies.Nobody is really a quirky action thriller in the mould of John Wick and Death Wish.Hutch Mansell (Odenkirk) lives a routine home and work life. It is a life of drudgery and plodding. Hutch seems sick and tired that the spark has gone.Yet it turns out that this is the life Hutch wanted. A home invasion reveals the man Hutch used to be.When he injures a gangster's brother. The Russian gangster comes after Hutch. Only to find that Hutch has a certain set of skills and is a man not to be messed around with.This is an off centre action thriller. Odenkirk is an unlikely action hero, far departed from the likes of Keanu Reeves and Liam Neeson.His everyman persona works well, although it seemed evident that Hutch was someone who once worked in special ops or dark espionage.Some of the violence is over the top, but Nobody is an enjoyable and entertaining action movie.",Nobody
3,nogodnomasters,Does it have a basement?,9,19 April 2021,"Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) is a mild mannered auditor who works for his father-in-law. He allows a couple of crooks to get away with his watch and the contents of the kitchen table bowl. He is belittled for it. When his daughter mentions her kitty cat bracelet was in the bowl, he goes full John Wick vigilante to find it. He ends up crossing paths with the Russian mafia run by a connected and backed sociopath.While considered an action film, you can't help but laugh at many of the scenes. As well as integrated humor they managed a great classic soundtrack to make you smile. My favorite scene was when the Russian computer girl gets Hutch Mansell's file.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Nobody
4,kosmasp,Don't mess with ... Nobody,9,6 July 2021,"Yes the grammar would be wrong if I actually meant to say ""anybody"". There are things that you know are wrong (double negatives) and then there are things that may feel wrong (guilty pleasures) but actually are soooooo right! More than right to be exact! And considering the age of Bob Odenkirk it is quite the achievement they made him look so good during the action scenes - same rings true for Christopher Lloyd! An icon in his own right.So the casting is amazing and the poster sort of tells you what is going to happen in the movie. It does not give you any backstory or context ... but that you will get in the movie. Yes certain things are convienient and yes for some it may take a bit too much time until the action really starts ... but like with John Wick, there is a reason our main character goes off ... a small reason for some and considering how that turns out ... or pops up (no pun intended), one can see how it all could have been avoided ... of course the lid could not have been kept on for much longer anyway.Very well edited (especially the mundane everyday or week happenings) our main character has to go through. There are things that may not make much sense, but there might be some deleted scenes which would explain why for example our main character does not seem to be bothered that he lost his Metro (sub) card ... and we all notice because it is being used often ... not in a different manner mind you, but for what it is was invented and intended.Having said all that, the movie is really fun to watch. I wouldn't mind getting a sequel to this ... which I reckon the ending sort of suggests anyway ...",Nobody
5,jboothmillard,Nobody,7,17 June 2021,"I had been used to seeing the lead actor in comedic roles, including the comic relief he brought to Breaking Bad, so I was looking forward to seeing him attempt a more serious role. Basically, Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) is a seemingly ordinary working family man, married to Becca (Connie Nielsen), with two children, teenage son Blake (Gage Munroe) and young daughter Sammy (Paisley Cadorath). He has an unremarkable job working in the office of a fabrication company owned by his father-in-law Eddie (Michael Ironside). His tedious and repetitive daily routine and lifestyle is slowly grinding on him. One night, an armed man and woman break into his house, and Blake tackles one of them. Hutch is reluctant to intervene and lets the thieves get away. The incident causes everyone to think he is a failure. Hutch contacts his half-brother Harry (rapper RZA) on a radio hidden in his office and explains that he held back because the burglars were desperate, scared, and using an unloaded gun. Later that day, Sammy notices her kitty cat bracelet is missing, and ponders that the thieves took it. Without saying a word, Hutch goes to see his elderly father David (Christopher Lloyd) in his care home and borrows his old FBI badge and gun to track down the burglars. He recalled the woman burglar had a distinctive tattoo on her wrist and tracks down the tattoo parlour to find the apartment of the burglars. He breaks into the thieves' apartment and threatens them, but he sees they are caring for a sick baby, and he leaves, feeling guilty and frustrated. Boarding the bus he takes home, a gang of drunken thugs board, and start making advances towards a female passenger. Using this as an excuse, he takes out his frustration on the gang, beating them savagely, until they are overcome, he walks away with many wounds himself. At home, Hutch realises he has become somewhat distant from Becca and his children, he finds his self-esteem renewed and makes an effort to reconnect with them. Meanwhile, it turns out that one of Hutch's victims during the beating is the younger brother of notorious Russian crime lord Yulian Kuznetsov (Aleksey Serebryakov). Talking to Harry, Hutch is sent to see a man referred to as ""The Barber"" (Colin Salmon), who provides Hutch with information about Yulian. Seeking revenge, Yulian sends his right-hand man Pavel (Araya Mengesha) and a crew to capture Hutch at home. Seeing the crew approaching, Hutch hides his family in the basement, protected by a security system, and kills most of the attackers before Pavel tasers him. Hutch is locked in the trunk of the crew's car, but he is able to remove his restraints and uses a fire extinguisher to cause the car to crash, killing everyone. Surviving the crash, Hutch returns to his family and sends them away to safety. Before leaving he sets his house on fire to destroy any evidence and steals the neighbour's new car. It is explained that Hutch is a former ""auditor,"" an assassin employed by intelligence agencies to kill people who were considered untouchable. Hutch previously let one of his targets go free, found the man a year later, reformed and living happily with a new family. Wanting a normal family life of his own, Hutch decided, against the wishes of his superiors, to retire, and may have over-corrected his personality to fit his new life as a family man. Hutch uses a stash of gold bars he had been hiding for some time to buy Eddie's company. He next finds the warehouse Yulian was protecting millions for the mob and burns all the money. Knowing that an Yulian will come after him, Hutch returns to the factory and sets up many boobytraps. He pays Yulian a quick visit at his club and antagonises him, and is only able to walk out as he is armed with a bomb. Yulian and his men show up at the factory, one by one the gangsters are killed by the boobytraps, and Hutch is surprised when David and Harry show up to eliminate the gangsters using a variety of weapons. They kill all the gunmen until only Yulian is left. Out of ammo, Hutch charges at him with a Claymore mine attached to a bulletproof shield and detonates it, killing Yulian. Hutch ensures his father and brother escape, and is arrested, only for the arresting officers to receive phone calls from someone forcing them to release him any charges to be dropped. Three months later, Hutch and Becca are being shown around a new house they may buy. During the viewing, Hutch receives a call suggesting that his services are still required, and he asks if the house has a basement. There is also a scene where Harry and David are seen driving to an undisclosed location in an RV filled with weapons. Also starring Billy MacLellan as Charlie Williams, and Aleksandr Pal as Teddy Kuznetsov. Odenkirk is surprisingly well cast as the self-declared ""nobody"" who hides a secret past life that comes back to bite him, Serebryakov is a good choice as the Russian criminal after him, and Lloyd is fantastic as the home-bound dad who gets to kick ass. The film knows its own absurdity, and there are the tiniest moments you notice it, but it doesn't matter, it has a great soundtrack of songs, including ""What a Wonderful World"" by Louis Armstrong, ""The Impossible Dream"" by Andy Williams and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" by Gerry & The Pacemakers, and you cannot help but be pulled in by the tense, energetic and explosive sequences, a fun action thriller. Very good!",Nobody
6,paul_haakonsen,Wow! This was just phenomenal...,7,29 August 2021,"Why have this movie eluded me until now late in 2021? Sure, I had stumbled upon the movie earlier this year, but the movie's cover/poster was one that made me believe that this was just another Bob Odenkirk comedy, so I put off sitting down to watch it.And now that I finally took the time to watch it, I must admit that I had certainly been missing out on a great movie. Wow. Are you kidding me, this movie was just spectacular and entertaining from start to end.The storyline in ""Nobody"", as written by Derek Kolstad, was really something else. With the movie starting out tediously set with repetitive routines, the storyline slowly starts to unfold and director Ilya Naishuller slowly piles on more and more of storytelling and action scenes. Boy there was an abundance of good action to be seen in ""Nobody"".I have to admit that I am now looking at Bob Odenkirk in a whole new light here, after having seen his performance in ""Nobody"". This was an amazing change of pace for this guy, and he really managed to carry the movie well with his performance, showing that he can do action movies as good as he can do comedy.This movie had a great cast ensemble, with the likes of Bob Odenkirk putting on a rather surprising performance. But also have the likes of Michael Ironside, Connie Nielsen and Christopher Lloyd on the cast list.""Nobody"" was a movie that just sidewinded me, and this is without a doubt a movie that you must sit down and watch, should you get the chance. Especially if you enjoy a good old fashioned action movie with a good story, great pacing and an abundance of action.My rating of ""Nobody"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",Nobody
7,Quinoa1984,Better Call Hutch,7,31 March 2021,"Simply by Derek Kolstad being the writer and co-producer on Nobody, as he was for all of the John Wick movies, it doesn't just invite yet encourage comparison. But so does seeing Bob Odenkirk delivering his Everyman-but-Just-you-Wait type of performance that he brought to Jimmy on Better Call Saul (as great as he was on Breaking Bad, BCS is its own beast where he has absolutely come into his own as one of the most significant actors of his age, and a deeper character too). Hutch isn't Jimmy, however, and there isn't quite as much depth for him to mine.On the other hand, I wouldn't *want* this to be too deep, either. How could it, unless it went further into the Cronenberg/Josh Olsen History of Violence pool? This is Kolstad doing a genre Salt-Shaker (hey, maybe I should make that a new term to use more often, couldn't hurt) of a bit of John Wick, but also HoV and just any given number of ""I'm Trying to be Cool but OK Watch Out Now: *BOOM* action flicks that were popularized through Bronson and the Death Wishes. Come to think of it, if anything this is closer to what I would have wanted to see in those movies - at least in this first half.Once it's revealed who Hustch really is, and that the Just-Explained-Enough background with his dad (oh Christopher Lloyd I missed you having a real character to play, no more Oogieloves for you, pal) and uh brother (the Rza, in it just enough) makes more sense, then the movie does have some cards to play we've seen before. It took a little while, but by 2021 I think we can now safely say Russian Mob Very Very Evil Kill Machines is... done, and overdone, albeit with a touch of karaoke I guess this time (?)But it can't be stressed enough that the action in this is choreographed on that same high standard level as the Wick movies, which means more often than not - at the least with the bus fight, and a few other moments - people actually look like they get *hurt* and it is refreshing that it keeps to being fun while so stylized, and that Odenkirk elevates it. We just don't get action stars like him, and as I left the theater on the drive home I pondered if sort of Black Ops Deep Cover ""Nobody"" bad-ass fighters and killers in the government agencies look more like him than a Keanu Reeves or Denzel Washington.And while the movie has a good sense of humor about it for the most part (the part that isn't most reminds me why I had issues with Hardcore Henry, but that's minor things like nitpicks with music cues and stuff), Odenkirk isn't playing it as a joke - again, this is the same commitment to Jimmy throughout, and so it isn't that he has to rise to the level of a Connie Nielsen or Lloyd, on the contrary they got to keep up with him. In other words, Nobody is a well-spun, fun, ""mindless"" piece of entertainment that I can't wait for my mother to see months from now (she's even more into BCS than I am, which is a whole other conversation).",Nobody
8,bevo-13678,Punchy,10,17 October 2021,"If you haven't watched Nobody yet, do yourself a favour. Best movie I've seen in ages That's not my words it's someone else's but I totally vouch for him. He's never sold me a dud movie.",Nobody
9,CinemaSerf,A film nobody will remember...,6,14 September 2021,"Not sure there is a lot of point in trying to review this derivate effort in any detail - it is an hybrid of plenty of other movies we have seen time and time again, most notably ""Home Alone"" partnered with any number of ass-kicking movies that feature long fight scenes, or a hero hopelessly outnumbered prevailing against baddies who couldn't hit a cow barn with an Howitzer. The dialogue is pretty banal, as are the characterisations - insofar as director Ilya Naishuller actually tried to make them important. It is, however, a very good looking film with plenty of (repetitive) action and if you like the end-to-end action genre with precisely no jeopardy to the plot, then there are worse ways of killing ninety minutes. I don't think you will recall it afterwards, though, even with ""Doc"" trying his best...",Nobody
10,zardoz-13,Nobody Does It Better!!!,10,13 April 2021,"""Better Call Saul"" star Bob Odenkirk plays an unlikely but invincible troubleshooter in director Ilya Naishuller's ""Nobody,"" a white-knuckled, slam-bang, high octane epic about tough guys gone berserk. Mind you, Odenkirk resembles a woebegone sad sack with a five o'clock shadow, but he has skillfully concealed the truth about himself. Primarily, the villains get into trouble when they mistake our hero's casual attitude as an open invitation to attack him. Imagine their shock when he retaliates with the swift savagery of either a John Wick and/or a John Rambo. Literally, our pugnacious protagonist paints the walls, ceilings, and floors with their gore while the filmmakers paint him into challenging corners. If you're having second thoughts about Odenkirk's credentials as a tough guy hero, consider those of Russian-born director Ilya Naishuller as well as scenarist Derek Kolstad. Naishuller helmed ""Hardcore Harry"" (2015), an adrenalin-laced, free-for-all, first-person shooter saga shot with head-mounted GoPro cameras to heighten its volatile spontaneity. Meantime, Kolstad originated the John Wick character for Keanu Reeves and wrote the first two ""John Wick"" bloodbaths. Basically, these two know all the genre clichés and conventions and rarely miss a chance to wow us with revelations about their improbable protagonist and his psychotic adversary. Naishuller orchestrates several staccato shootouts, and his choreography of close-quarters combat will dazzle you with its acrobatics. Russian-born actor Aleksei Serebryakov of ""The 9th Company"" chews the scenery with evil gusto as the chief villain. He never gives our hero a break. Despite being both outnumbered and outgunned, the imperturbable Odenkirk maintains a stiff, upper lip throughout this ferocious, foul-mouthed, R-rated thriller. ""Nobody"" bristles with enough fireworks for three movies. Nevertheless, our hero suffers his share of dire adversity, too. You may recognize some familiar faces in the cast. Veteran character actors Christopher Lloyd and Michael Ironside co-star with British thespian Colin Salmon, who made three Pierce Brosnan-era James Bond movies, and Wu-Tang Clan leader Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, a.k.a. RZA, is cast as our hero's stepbrother.Our protagonist, Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) toils from 9 to 5 am as an auditor for his father-in-law, Eddie Williams (Michael Ironsides of ""Starship Troopers""), at a small family-owned factory. Hutch is married to Eddie's daughter, Becca (Connie Nielsen of ""Gladiator""), and they live in a comfortable house with their two children, a six-year-old daughter called Abby (newcomer Paisley Cadorath) and a son named Blake (Gage Munroe of ""The Shack""), a teenager in high school. Becca has the more visible job of the two. Her photo adorns one wall of the bus station where Hutch hoofs it every morning. Becca drives the kids to school, while Hutch rides the bus. Hutch's life has become a monotonous grind. Jolting montages of his repetitive routines depicts Hutch's numbing workdays. Meantime, Blake tolerates his father, while Abby dotes on her daddy. Meantime, Hutch and Becca's marriage has lost its allure. They share the same bed but for sleeping only. Becca has raised a 'no man's land' barrier between them. They haven't indulged in conjugal bliss for years. Hutch doesn't complain. Becca chides Hutch about being late getting the garbage on time for the Tuesday curb pick-up. When he must write a paper for his history class about a military veteran, Blake approaches Becca's arrogant brother, Charley Williams (Billy MacLellan of ""Goalie""), because he served in the field. Comparatively, Hutch served behind the lines as an auditor.Things change one night when Hutch cannot sleep. Hearing noises in their house, he encounters two intruders, darkly clad in masks and gloves, with the female of the pair armed with a revolver. Surprising the male burglar, Blake tackles him to the floor, while Hutch balks at clobbering the female burglar with a golf club. Brandishing her revolver, she waves it in his face. Later, Hutch claims he only sought to minimize the danger the two intruders posed to his family. One uniformed policeman praises Hutch's prudence, while his partner brags he would have decked her with the golf club. Similarly, Hutch's obnoxious next-door neighbor dreams that somebody would have the audacity to burglarize his house. At work, Charlie ridicules Hutch about losing his nerve, while Eddie consoles his son-in-law and says he did the right thing.Everything comes to a head when Abby complains about her missing kitty cat bracelet. She says she left it in the large dish of other miscellaneous items that the burglars plundered. Hutch has struggled with guilty feelings for not defending his family during a moment of crisis. Now, he stalks off to find the burglars. He caught a glimpse of a tattoo on the woman's wrist. Hutch masquerades as an FBI agent and tours all the tattoo parlors around town. Eventually, he finds the man & wife burglar, recovers his wristwatch but not Abby's kitty cat bracelet. Frustrated by this turn of events, he catches a ride home on the Metro bus. Along the way, a quartet of rowdy toughs crash their vehicle and board the bus. When they bother a lone female passenger, Hutch's rage erupts, and he clashes with them in a knockdown, drag-out slugfest. He walks away with a stab wound, while the foursome land in the hospital.One of the four turns out to be the brother of Russian mobster Yulian Kuznetsov (Aleksey Serebryakov), and he is lucky to be alive, but his doctor says he won't walk again. Although he didn't have much use for his brother, Yulian feels the tug of family ties. He discovers Hutch's identity and dispatches hit teams to wipe out Hutch and his family. Clocking in at 96 breathless minutes, ""Nobody"" piles on the action like an avalanche while Naishuller sets up Kolstad's plot in the first twenty minutes and aligns audience sympathy with Hutch. Several claustrophobic shootouts are staged with aplomb, while Odenkirk performs most of his own stunts. The brawls are executed with finesse and humor. Yulian's explosive death scene is unforgettable. Ultimately, ""John Wick"" cannot hold a candle to ""Nobody.""",Nobody
11,grantss,Mindless and unoriginal,4,23 October 2021,"After thieves invade his home and he fails to stop them, a mild-mannered accountant, Hutch Mansell, seeks retribution. This triggers a chain of events that sees Mansell targeted by the Russian mob. The odds seem stacked against him but, unknown to most, Mansell's former occupation left him with a special set of skills.I didn't have great expectations for this, as it looked like your average revenge movie. Turns out calling in a revenge movie would be giving it too much credit as that would involve a half-decent plot. The plot is wafer-thin and merely a device for heaps of action sequences. Nothing really follows in any plausible fashion, everything is just a set-up for the next fight scene.More than this, it's all been done before, and better.

14,neil-476,Good stuff,8,10 June 2021,"One of the things I enjoyed about this film is that, knowing nothing about the movie, I misread where it was going. Should I spoil that for others who haven't seen it? Well, I'm going to, so don't read on it you don't want spoilers.Bob Odenkirk is Hutch, a husband and dad in a boring job at his father-in-law's business. He puts out the garbage too late, does pull-ups on the shelter at the bus stop in the morning, and regrets that his relationship with his wife has gone stale. When he catches two burglars, they pull a gun on him despite his being able to clobber one of them with a golf club, earning his son's scorn. He goes looking for them to recover his daughter's Kittycat bracelet, and his actions when he finds them illuminate his character. He subsequently has a run-in with some undesirables, and we discover that he can handle himself. Unfortunately, one of these is theyounger brother of a psychpathic handler of Russian mafia pension fund cash.This movie is built out of bits of other movies. We start with realising the Hutch is essentially, from The Equaliser or Taken. Then the problem with the Russian psycho is straight out of John Wick. Finally Hutch takes a leaf out of Kevin's book and sets one or two little traps for his assailants.I enjoyed this more than John Wick because the setup was better, and there wasn't so much reliance on videogame capping of nameless bodies (although there is some of this). There are some fun lines, a greater sense of genuine jeopardy, and - pleasingly - Hutch is pleased to get back into a way of life which he misses.Odenkirk is good, and Christopher Lloyd has more fun than he's had in years.",Nobody
15,ferguson-6,Saul is Wick,6,25 March 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Revenge movies have long been popular because they let us live out the fantasy of getting even - a chance real life rarely offers. Of course, few of us actually cross paths with Russian mobsters or have a secret life that requires our government personnel file be redacted. But all of the above is in play for director Ilya Naishuller's first feature film since his debut, HARDCORE HENRY (2015), an innovate POV action/sci-fi movie.While watching this, numerous other movies kept popping into my head, but front-and-center were the JOHN WICK movies. It wasn't until afterwards that I discovered this film's writer was Derek Kolstad, the creator and writer of the first three John Wick movies to date. Knowing that leads to the obvious comparison of leading men - Keanu Reeves versus Bob Odenkirk. Yep, the same Bob Odenkirk who owns the Saul Goodman role from ""Breaking Bad"" and its terrific spinoff, ""Better Call Saul"". And nope, he's not as cool as Keanu, but it's the risk of casting against type that prevents this from being same old, same old.Odenkirk stars as Hutch Mansell, a suburban husband and father, working as a bookkeeper at the shop owned by his father-in-law (Michael Ironside, TOTAL RECALL, 1990). A brilliantly edited opening sequence shows us the daily drudgery of Hutch's life. The rapid cuts tell the story of a man whose existence involves taking the bus to a dead-end job, filling his coffee cup, receiving little respect or affection from family, and yelling at the backend of a garbage truck. Things only get worse when, one night, intruders break into his home. His teenage son (Gage Munroe) springs into action, but Hutch freezes, and is viewed as weak by just about everyone.It's at this point where Hutch awakens - his secret past coming back to life. Now you might chuckle a bit at the thought of Odenkirk playing a man who once was so dangerous, he was known as an ""auditor"" ... the last person you want to see at your door. Well, that's not likely to be your last chuckle, because the over-the-top moments are just getting started. Hutch fights a group of thugs on a city bus, and the one that dies just happens to be the little brother of Russian mobster kingpin Yulian, played with gusto by Aleksey Serebryakov (LEVIATHAN, 2014). Like us, Yulian underestimates Hutch, and most of the movie is spent with every living Russian gangster trying to end Hutch.Hopefully by now you have intuited that Naishuller's movie is cartoonish in nature, and has no sense of realism or logic. If you're not quite sure yet, you should know that 82 year old Christopher Lloyd (as Hutch's ex-FBI father) joins in on the action - and I mean, he actually joins in on the shootouts. Think of ""Mayhem"" from the Allstate commercials and you get some idea of the exaggerated shoot 'em up/ blow 'em up nature of the action. Connie Nielsen (GLADIATOR, 2000) plays Hutch's wife and RZA plays Hutch's equally-talented brother.If one squints and twists, there is some insight into today's emasculated male - those more likely to bake lasagna than take down an intruder. But mostly it's just exaggerated revenge action in a way that mirrors John Wick, rather than DEATH WISH (1974) or STRAW DOGS (1971). Director Naishuller gets extra credit for poking fun at the never-ending ammo issue in most action movies, and it might have benefitted from a bit more humor along the lines of the kitty cat bracelet. Fans of the John Wick movies will likely find enjoyment here, but probably ""nobody"" else ... especially those looking for Saul Goodman cleverness. This film opens March 26, 2021.",Nobody

17,deloudelouvain,Entertaining and violent.,8,1 July 2021,"Since the top notch series Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul I'm a fan of Bob Odenkirk. He's a pleasant actor to watch. In Nobody he's the leading character, playing a brutal ex-secret agent/murderer and that role fits him well. It's a vigilante story, with a lot of ultra violence (which is all nicely choreographed) and a story that is pleasant to follow. It's of course a bit over the top but the cinematography makes up for that. I wasn't really a fan of the exaggerated last scenes that could have been avoided but overal Nobody is a good movie. It's entertaining, never boring, with a lot of action (the good kind) and a good cast.",Nobody
18,siderite,John Wick without the style,6,17 April 2021,"Now, Bob Odenkirk did a wonderful job as an actor. He made this film bearable, some might even say fun. But other than that it was a pretty stupid movie. I understand the desire of people to entertain violent fantasies, especially in these frustrating times, but the plot of the film makes no sense, Bob's character has no redeeming qualities and there is nothing to be learned from it except what not to do.For a moment I thought it was going to be a film about an average Joe who takes on a small time thug, because even normal people have resources they chose not to tap into until they are really pushed into it. That would have made a bit more sense and would have empowered the viewer. I miss movies like Falling Down. But no, the premise is stolen almost verbatim from John Wick: amazing killer on hiatus gets pissed off by Russian gangsters. But at least John Wick had his dog killed while grieving, in Nobody it feels like the Russians are actually more in the right. The only reason this guy starts killing people is because he feels the need to, while he and the people he cares about are not killed out of pure luck alone. The takeaway here being that a normal life with a wife and two kids while people keep pushing your buttons and step on your pride (so basically the life of most viewers of this film) is not enough, may even be shameful. Way to cater to your audience!I felt so bad for Daniel Bernhardt, credited somewhere in ""nobody reads this"" land as ""Bus goon"". He was never the greatest actor of all time, but damn, to be relegated to the cannon fodder category...Bottom line: Cardboard characters, dubious morals, action scenes that feel good just because you were trained from childhood that revenge and machismo is cool and satisfying. Nothing in this film is real in any sense of the word. A shameless John Wick copy paste that skimped on the visual style and the budget.",Nobody

20,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Self-plagiarism is still a form of plagiarism.,7,29 September 2021,"If Derek Kolstad handed this script in for a university assignment, he would fail due to self-plagiarism. Seriously, though, 'Nobody (2021)' is remarkably similar to 'John Wick (2015)', Kolstad's previous (and far superior) 'killer coming out of retirement' piece, and some of its sequences literally feel as though they've been lifted directly from it - almost shot-for-shot, even. That's not inherently a bad thing, I suppose; after all, if you're going to copy something, why not copy one of the best action films of recent years? It's not as if the thing is a total rip-off, either. It brings several of its own ideas to the table and is ultimately a distinct experience. It may be in the shadow of the picture it's most directly inspired by, but it isn't totally eclipsed by it. There's a lot to like here, primarily the action sequences and the casting. By all accounts, Bob Odenkirk put in some serious training time and it really does show. He does most of his own stunts, makes the action all the more believable, and he plays his part really well. It's actually a rather subdued performance for the most part, but it still has a lot of gravitas and it livens up the relatively derivative narrative. As does Christopher Lloyd, who's nothing other than a delight in his scenes. The action is exciting, brutal and, eventually, balls-to-the-wall ridiculous. It escalates as the movie progresses and is always enjoyable, its fast-paced but typically grounded choreography framed with clean yet visually pleasing cinematography. The piece does have an odd tone that fluctuates fairly wildly over its runtime, though. It almost seems like a couple of different movies pushed into a slim ninety-minute frame. Some of it is a little bit groan-inducing, too; the dialogue isn't always as sharp as it perhaps could have been. In the end, though, it's an entertaining action movie throughout. There's a lot to like here, even if it doesn't quite come together as much as you'd like it to. 7/10.",Nobody
21,Cineanalyst,Anybody,7,28 July 2021,"Nothing especially novel here as far as I see, but what ""Nobody"" does, it tends to do well. This includes the excellent fight choreography, the mostly effective mixing of action and comedy from the makers of the ""John Wick"" franchise and the first-person-shooter experiment of a movie ""Hardcore Henry"" (2015), and casting a former non-action-star actor as the action star--something that, indeed, has become increasingly common since at least ""Taken"" (2008), as well as the MCU and similar franchises gobbling up all the best actors. I suppose if I had to have guessed which comedian from ""Mr. Show"" would go on to critical acting success in dramatic TV shows and to, then, bulk up and fight stunt men on a bus as he approached 60 years of age, I would've guessed Bob Odenkirk, but it's still rather surprising. Anyways, he's quite good and likeable as always.Another thing I found especially interesting here, though, is a device that's been used elsewhere, too, including in a Liam Neeson action burger such as ""The Commuter"" (2018). As there, ""Nobody"" begins by framing its protagonist as an unsatisfied everyman who continually enacts a daily routine--albeit one who exercises more than most. It's a neat way to envelop the spectator in the picture. The obvious assumption being that the typical movie-goer doesn't have ""a very particular set of skills."" They're nobody, anybody and everybody. One might assume that this spectator expects in a movie that they are to see the opposite, the unordinary--a movie about somebody. Movies as escapism. Indeed, that's what ""Nobody"" ultimately delivers, but not before the ""grass is greener"" reversal, of a basic middle-class life where husband and wife live in suburbia with a couple children, and they all share dinner at the table. Norman Rockwell-type fantasy, but not specifically an American dream.Some might argue--indeed, someone did to me--that this makes for a slow beginning, but I think it reflexively clever and important. All of the later backstory establishing whom this supposed nobody actually is, however, while perhaps amusing on an isolated scene-by-scene basis, does bog down the plot unnecessarily. I do especially like the scenes of a couple characters running away when they identify him, though. I checked out the deleted scenes on the disc after watching the movie, and all of them are more along these lines, so I think the filmmakers realized the problem, but just didn't entirely fix it. The elderly father played by Christopher Lloyd and the friend as by RZA don't add much of anything and surely don't justify any mid-credits scenes. Unfortunately, I sense this is just pre-emptive work to set up a potential sequel or franchise. Because, apparently, they can't just make movies and see whether they're any good first and whether a good follow-up could be made. Nowadays, the prospect seemingly must be baked in from the start. Oh well, it's a fun one nonetheless.",Nobody

Yeah, not only does it star the guy that played that rather shifty lawyer in Breaking Bad, but is was made by the guys that brought you John Wick, and I have to admit it certainly doesn't disappoint. Sure, many of us might say that it is a little too much like John Wick, but there are a number of things that make it stand out, one of them being that it is absolutely hilarious. So, like Wick, we have this guy that used to work for some shadowy organisation, but he decided that he wanted to get out and live a normal life for a change.Well, he did but a part of him is itching to return, and when his house is burgled, and he decides to let the robbers go, people start asking questions as to whether he is really up to protecting his family. The problem is that he was an auditor, the type of guy that if he rocked up at your door you knew that you were in a lot of trouble, and it is unlikely that you were going to get out of the situation alive.So, he sees some guys picking on a woman in the bus (this is after he tracks down the home invaders, much to their horror, looking for his daughter's kitty cat bracelet), and basically puts them into hospital. Well, the problem is that one of the guys happens to be the cousin of this Russian mafia dude, and despite the fact that the Russian mafia dude really doesn't like his cousin, the fact that he was put in hospital by essentially a nobody means that he is out for revenge.As such, we have a John Wick style of pretty much everybody coming after him, and him pretty much dealing with them without breaking a sweat. Yet, as I mentioned, there are some pretty good scenes in the film, especially Christopher Lloyd, whose character ends up being much, much more than you would have expected. However, I really don't want to spoil anymore other than if you liked John Wick, and you are looking for some action, then this is definitely a film to go out and watch - it's worth it.",Nobody

About an auditor who goes after the Russian mob after they decide to put a hit on him and his family. The movie is a non stop thrill ride. And violent.The plot is a basic generic story. Hutch (Bob Odenkirk) a regular family man. Who is getting bored with his life. Living day by day with life and work. When a robber breaks into his own. He lets them go. Which everyone thinks he is useless. When he comes across a group of Russian mobs that start harrassing a teen girl on a bus. Which he takes matters into his own hands. Drawing the attention of a mobs brother Yulian (Aleksei Serebryakov). Fun plot. About an ex auditor which Hutch used to attack bad guys for living. Making him an experienced assassin.It is a fun direction with some humor from the likes of Bob Odenkirk. It does have some violent action sequences that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Violent shoot outs. Gritty fight sequences that some may leave you squirmish. It is not as great as the John Wick films. But still nonetheless entertaining. Shoot out scenes. Car chase. And action climatic scene where bad guys are being attacked with booby traps and creative ways.Bob Odenkirk did great with the character. Taking on a action role. Along with Connie Nielsen playing his wife. And knows what he is up too. Christopher Lloyd also had fun playing his dad in the movie. Rza playing a mysterious handler to Hutch.

Brief Review -A Smashing, Excessive, Glorious and Blockbuster Action Mania. Feeling bored of watching typically cheesy action Flicks? Well, here in your antidote for it. Nobody is for made everybody who loves to watch entertaining action flicks, doesn't matter what age-group you belong to. Nobody follows a story of a man who, while following clues regarding his recent home invasion, helps an underaged girl being harassed by a group of men, only to become the target of a vengeful drug lord. A common guy from the crowd who is just a nobody has some secrets that will blow your mind. Although, it is very predictable from the beginning, it follows exactly the same storyline you wish to predict. You want the man to tackle biggies? Yes, he does it. You want couple of supportive characters? You got it. You want a happy ending? You have it. You name it and you get everything possible out there. Bob Odenkirk is on smashing spree throughout the film. You'll love his attitude, his simplicity and then his surprising avatar. Connie Nielsen as his wife looks pretty but got nothing much for the acting. Aleksei Serebryakov could have shown more evilness as that was required to tackle the strong opponent which is not there. Just brace yourself because Christopher Lloyd is just bang-on! I didn't expect it but it was freaking amazing and amusing experience seeing this guy in unimaginable sequences. I won't spoil what he does but i must tell, watch out for him and don't underestimate the Papa. Nobody is very pacy film and all the action sequences will keep you hooked throughout the runtime. You will hardly find a moment of disconnect and that's Ilya Naishuller's biggest achievement here. His direction is superb for this decent storyline and that's what makes the film uplift its low potential to high level. Overall, a splendid action flick.

The ""John Wick"" style action thriller is elevated from being a run of the mill action thriller by the casting of Bob Odenkirk as the main character.Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk), a resigned father and husband further earns the antipathy of his son by not standing up to two burglars who invade his house on a home invasion. Mansell though is keeping several secrets; his history as government agent, the fighting skills he has honed and the dampened rage that he keeps inside. When a good Samaritan situation sees him release some of that anger, he becomes a target for the Russian Mafia and must use all his contacts and training to defend his family.Whereas in other hands, ""Nobody"" might have become a simple ""John Wick"" parody film, here it's more like a companion piece. Set in a slightly more realistic world Odenkirk grounds the film as a realistic character who, crucially, did all the training to do the fight scenes himself. It's well shot and the visual effects, as well as the fight choreography is excellent. Christopher Lloyd and the RZA appear in the film as it runs on, and both add much needed back story to the role.It is, to be fair though, not particularly original.

Then one night, Hutch catches two burglars in his house, but when given the chance to whack one of them, he doesn't. Eventually the burglars retreat. But the episode doesn't sit well with Hutch's wife and son. It triggers a reaction within Hutch, the likes of which are unforeseen, and violent... At this point we are less than 10 min. Into the film, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by Russian Ilya Naishuller (""Hardcore Henry""). Here he goes down a familiar road: the loner who, pushed against the wall, hits back, and hits back hard. Hutch is a veritable one-man army, and you'd better get out of the way if he comes for you. The story line wafer-thin, but guess what: it doesn't matter! It's all about the action where Hutch, against all odds, fights off the Russian mafia. Fair warning: this movie is rated R for good reason. This isn't just some fighting, it's over the top ultra-violence. But also this: this is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. I was literally laughing out loud quite a bit of the time while watching this. Bob Odenkirk is perfectly cast as the loner Hutch.

Some directors are almost a guaranteed sign of a quality film, however I had never seen a film by Ilya Naishuller before. Clearly he's extremely capable though because 'Nobody' is a classy product. I did know it was written by Derek Kolstad who is behind the 'John Wick' franchise, so I was certainly expecting a well oiled script.My expectations going into this were ""John Wick, but more funny"" (based on Bob Odenkirk being in the lead role). I didn't quite get that and I think that was where the film let me down a little. There was very little humour in the movie at all, and that which there was rarely made me laugh. So that just leaves you with a 'John Wick' style movie. The problem was I struggled with the motivation and I struggled to buy Odenkirk in this type of a role. Wick had the dog. Everyone was on his side immediately from that point onwards. I never felt that here. The character motivation felt forced. And Odenkirk as a bad-ass was just a little too much for me to get onboard with.I also found the villain a little cliche. Angry Russians do make for very menacing antagonists to be fair, but they've just been done so many times before. The funny thing is I actually found quite a lot wrong with this movie, yet it was so well made that I didn't really care. I was able to just sit back and enjoy the ride.

Audiences must be lapping this up right now, just as they did with ""John Wick"". It's nice to have an action movie that doesn't feature guys in capes, I guess.People are also sounding the future cult movie horn. I'd dispute that. I don't think ""Nobody"" is different enough for that. It's no ""Brawl in Cell Block 99"", with its extraordinary violence and unusual pacing, nor ""Hardcore Henry"", with the surprisingly successful gimmick of the entire movie being shot from the perspective of the main character.""Nobody"" is more of an entertaining time-waster.

Bob plays a boring husband that does the same things over and over, with little variation. The mundane lifestyle is shown at the beginning; ride the bus to work, perform his accounting duties, ride the bus home, eat supper with his family, etc. There are personal problems with his wife, Connie, however. They sleep with a barrier of pillows between them, so there is no physical touching, not even kissing. Christopher plays Bob's father, who lives in a nearby nursing home. Then, 2 thieves break into Bob's house and Bob-trying to protect his family-does nothing to stop them. On a bus ride later, Bob sees a young girl get threatened by some wayward youths and something snaps in Bob. What he does starts a chain of events that leads to a John Wick style finale that will blow your socks off-even Christopher gets in on the action. You also find out more about Bob's past and how he knows the things he knows, and how to do them. Aleksey is a Russian drug lord that gets entangled with Bob and the wayward youths from the bus. There is lots of violence-like the John Wick movies-and there is also lots of humor.

46,alindsay-al,A Great Fun Action Film,8,29 June 2021,"It took me a bit longer then I expected by I have now watched Nobody and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a family man forced into his old violent habits when a Russian mob boss comes after him and his family.Main Character
I love Bob Odenkirk, Saul Goodman is one of the best characters in TV history and now seeing him take on this role is exciting and he really excels. Honestly, in the trailers I wasn't sure if I would buy him as this John Wick action star but he does a fantastic job of that, he is believable in all of the action scenes and his character is really interesting and well realised. We have seen Keanu Reeves, Denzel Washington and Chris Hemsworth be these one man armies characters and now Odenkirk is just as good and really knocks it out of the par.Supporting Characters
Connie Nielson plays his wife and she does a good job in the role, the two of them work well together and despite the fact that she doesn't have too much to work with I thought she did enough for a good performance. Christopher Lloyd plays his father and he is great as expected and is a real fun element of the film and it is really great to see him and Odenkirk interact on screen. RZA and Michael Ironside also do decent jobs in their smaller roles. But the issue here is with the villain played by Aleksey Serebryakov, he is your generic Russian gangster and despite him doing an alright job in the role his character is just really lacking and it feels like it is the part of the film that doesn't hold up compared to the rest.Story
The story is a fun watch, it does a good job of showing how this mans life has become dull and mundane but he gains happiness and confidence as the film progresses. The plot is designed towards the action scenes and they hold up really well and has good actors delivering fun and solid performances. But the plot is pretty generic, this former operative going after the Russian mob, it has been done a million times and though entertaining does leave something to be desired.Script
The script is good, there is some dark humour here that worked for me and I did care about Odenkirk's character and wanted to see him succeed and it does what it needs to do well enough.Style
The style of the film has some truly excellent action scenes, they are brutal, unique and exhilarating to watch. The film is paced well, after a bit of a slow start it really hits its strides and had me invested throughout for a truly enjoyable experience.Overall
Overall, Nobody is a great action film. Odenkirk really shines here and this is a really fun action film that for fans of that genre needs to be seen and appreciated.",Nobody

51,kirbylee70-599-526179,MILD MANNERED KILLER,9,9 August 2021,"While they really never quite left the action film genre has had a boost in recent years. That was mainly due to the three JOHN WICK films. These movie were not ashamed of what they were, pedal to the metal action pictures more fueled by the action than the story. That's not to say there wasn't a story but the action was front and center. So where do you take things from there? You give those skills to NOBODY.Bob Odenkirk stars as Hutch Mansell, an average ordinary guy. The introduction of Hutch to the viewer shows this. He wakes, jogs, makes breakfast, goes to work, clocks in, drinks coffee, goes home, eats dinner and sleeps with his wife with them divided by a couple of pillows. This is repeated for us over a few weeks' time to get the idea in our heads.Then one night things change. A couple of burglars break into the house. Hutch has a chance to take them down after his son tackles one but he doesn't do so. This leaves his son thinking him a coward. Nothing is missing but a few dollars and his watch. But when his little girl notices her kitty cat bracelet is missing Hutch changes. He suddenly has the skills to track down the burglars and follows them to their home where he takes back his watch. No bracelet though is on hand.With his rage unspent he takes a bus home only to have it boarded by a group of young Russian speaking punks after they crash their car. When they threaten a young girl on the bus he finds a way of releasing that pent up aggression. Suddenly this mild mannered accountant takes out 6 young guys at one time. Sure he gets hurt but the damage he imposes on them is far worse. The bad news though is one of them is the brother of a Russian gangster named Yulian (Aleksei Serebryakov).A message from an old friend named Harry (Rza) informs him of who he was dealing with and suggest he contact ""the Barber"". It turns out Hutch was a paid killer for hire who worked for those agencies that usually have 3 letters. The ""Barber"" gives him the information on the Russian gangster. It turns out he launders all the money for the Russian mob. And odds are he's coming for vengeance be that Hutch's family at home or his father (Christopher Lloyd) in a nursing home.They do indeed show up at his home but Hutch is prepared and hides his family in a safe location. After taking out most of the crew he is tazed and tossed in a trunk. But his skills get him out of there as well. He returns home, sends his family away to a safe location and prepares for a confrontation with Yulian and his men. Only one will walk away from this confrontation.Like the WICK films what we have here is an explosive action film that takes no prisoners. The pace of the action here is furious and done at such a speed as to make it more plausible than fight sequences of the past. Hutch may look like the average guy on the street but his skill set is far from what you would expect from your standard accountant. The film provides more action than most films and all of it is between character rather than lengthy car chases (though there is a short one here).One of the things that makes this film work remarkably well is the casting of Odenkirk in the lead role. Know mostly as a comedy writer before his career took off starring as corrupt lawyer Saul Goodman on the series BREAKING BAD, he looks just like an ordinary average guy. No slam on Odenkirk, I mean he's a good looking guy but is he Keanu Reeves? Sean Connery? No. So he has that going for him here, not looking like the typical tough guy we've come to expect in films. And yet he does a fantastic job in that role making both sides of the character seem plausible.Here's something that should come as no surprise once you see the film. It was directed and written by Derek Kolstad. I know the name is not familiar to most people. But his screenwriting is. You see Kolstad wrote all three JOHN WICK films. It makes sense once you watch this movie. And yet at the same time there is a difference between Hutch and Wick.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, enough that it must become a part of my collection. And while watching it and enjoying not just the action but the tiny bits of comedy thrown into the mix I kept thinking will they make another? I for one could see it happening and would enjoy it if they did. Who knows, maybe one day Hutch and Wick will meet up. Until then we can watch their exploits over and over again on disc.",Nobody

53,kluseba,Entertaining John Wick copycat case,7,28 June 2021,"Nobody is an action movie in the key of the John Wick franchise directed by Ilya Naishuller, who had his breakthrough with Hardcore Henry six years earlier. The movie revolves around a former assassin who has become a husband, father of two children and company worker who has kept a low profile for two decades. Things start turning sour after a case of break and enter when he decides to not assault the two masked criminals and lets them go which disappoints his son. The protagonist can't turn the page on those events since he is being ridiculed by everyone around him. He decides to track down the two criminals to teach them a lesson and get the stolen goods back. Just as the protagonist is ready to go back to his ordinary life, he encounters a group of intoxicated thugs who get on his bus to wreak havoc. The protagonist intervenes and severely injures his opponents. The problem is that one of the victims is the brother of a Russian crime lord who decides to go after the protagonist.This movie convinces on several levels. First of all, the action scenes have excellent choreography as they offer much entertainment. Secondly, lead actor Bob Odenkirk is playing way out of his comfort zone and delivering a surprisingly convincing job. The film convinces with solid pace and a perfect length of roughly an hour and a half.One the negative side, the movie clearly jumps the bandwagon and copies recent success stories such as the John Wick franchise. There is no creativity to be found in the dull plot. The opening thirty minutes overstay their welcome to introduce the different characters. The movie has an overall exaggerated tone intertwined with more serious passages which makes it somewhat unbalanced. Even after having watched the entire movie, one can't be sure whether this is supposed to be a serious action film, a parody or an awkward mixture between those extremes.Nobody is an overall entertaining and fast-paced action film that is best enjoyed with a couple of friends when you just feel like switching off your brain for one hour and a half.

He takes down Russian mobsters with ease, so much so that he never really hits that moment that most movies have where everything has gone wrong and the hero is at rock bottom. This guy stays in control pretty much the whole time, and his dad and brother even join in. The main villain never had a chance--he gets blown up without inflicting any lasting damage.

Odenkirk is a mild mannered schlub who does the books for a steel refinery. He's persona non grata in his own home where his wife, played by Connie Nielsen, a real estate broker, & his son go about their days as if he didn't exist getting attention only from his doting daughter but one night when a pair of armed thieves break into his home, at first he's more than happy to adhere to their demands handing over some petty cash & whatnot but then his son jumps into fray & when it looks like his son may get hurt, something, for a second, snaps in Odenkirk as he makes a move to thwart the robbery but he thinks better of it. When his daughter remarks about a missing trinket, he visits his aged father, played by Christopher Lloyd, at an old folks home & borrows his FBI badge where he tracks down one of the thieves to a tattoo shop but when he's rebuffed by the proprietor, a customer recognizes a mark on Odenkirk & disappears as if he's seen the devil & in a way he has. When Odenkirk's finally snaps on a public bus, he takes down a contingent of drunk merrymakers (sending nearly all to the hospital) prompting a relative of one of the victims, a Russian money man who guards the mob's bank, to go on a rampage even though Odenkirk's reputation sends shivers down the spines of his subordinates once his identity is established. Produced by the makers of the John Wick series, you get the sense a lot of this story was cobbled together from gags they probably wanted to use in the Reeves films but since this character is more of a tinkerer or trap setter (especially in the last reel), something Wick is not, it felt more organic to this guy but that doesn't mean it works since Odenkirk is the furthermost example of a man of action but that's me, maybe somebody else overcame that hurtle & will love this.

Bob Odenkirk is awesome in this film. I've always been a fan of his, but the film takes it to another level, and I loved every second of it. Knowing it was based upon an experience in his own life too just makes me appreciate his role so much more. Other standouts besides Odenkirk include our main villian played by Aleksey Serebryakov and of course Christopher Lloyd as Odenkirk's father. The film can feel familiar in some sense. It is written by John Wick screenwriter Derek Kolstad- who manages to give us his signature style without it feeling at all repetitive. It would be easy to pen a generic John Wick style film and call it a day, but Kolstad puts so much effort into every shot, every scene, and every line of dialogue that you can't help but be proud of him for his execution. Every action scene in this film is fantastic, and you'll be smiling your way through them as much as you will be cringing with glee. The cinematography is also outstanding, a beautiful, somber kind of gritty- and the soundtrack is a perfect balance of old tunes that spice up the film perfectly. It can also just eb incredibly funny at times, and it feels remicent to the classic action films of the 80's where humor was not so forced, nor an obstacle to be tackled.

REVIEW:You want an action movie to be fast, good, you got it in this film. Nobody has some setup but it does not take long for the movie to get the adrenaline going to the stuff most are coming to see this film for. Odenkirk's character Hutch has a lot of fight in his body, and once the beast awakens, the movie continues to take that momentum and seldom lose it to tangents, diverging stories, or random asides. However, the movie manages to avoid something that can be annoying in some films of playing the best cards up front and leaving little for the finale. However, Nobody's pacing and direction to gradually release the beast through the movie was a smart move for me. Hutch doesn't just John Wick to the full extent, unrelenting in his quest to achieve his goal with little mercy or dialogue. Instead, the movie decides to portray a struggle of the protagonist, trying to figure out just how far he is going to go as he weighs current life with past life and what brings pure joy. It sends a mixed message sure, but that struggle allows you to see the elevation of scenes throughout the movie as he balances these choices.What the story also manages to do though is inject humor in the right places without forcing it in like many movies do. Nobody's dry sarcasm is timed super well and used in sort of a verbal sparring that elevates rivalries and breaks the darker tension. But then the movie knows how to inject other quips into the madness, insults that are funny, cute chemistry between father and unsuspecting family and a few fun twists that use the secondary characters quite well. The great Christopher Lloyd was probably one of my favorite comedic devices in the film, not only in the simple geriatric jokes he makes, but the other surprises he pulls in this movie. Even the music comes in as a nice device for laughs, the peaceful tones meant to normally make calm are used in ironic movie scenes that act as the perfect contrast to the chaos unleashing. The nice balance of the comedy and edge helps refresh things from act to act and somehow make a fun, engaging character without all the backstory and fun.The selling point of this movie though is the action, hands down. Like The Equalizer Meets John Wick Meets Death Wish and RED, Nobody takes these styles, mashes them up, and puts out something fun and dynamic that's mostly its own. For one thing the diversity of these scenes surprised me as it bypassed the fight we've seen in the trailers of brutal fist fights, and turned into the assassin led beauty that Taken teased me with long ago. Those fights only get more ""fun"" to watch as different scenes call for different tactics that brings the Equalizer parts in and uses strategy, smarts, and brawn to mix things up and bring more of the sweet finishes that this genre does well with. Again, the comedy I mentioned earlier manages to work itself in here as well. Some intended moments are timed super well with a character's intervention or quip, but others come in the form of the justice filled finish of the kills and moves that somehow just feel satisfying to watch. And finally, the invincible syndrome I hate in these movies was bypassed, which is a plus given how cheesy it makes the fights. Think of Wick where despite all the punches he takes, he finds a means to fight like nothing happened which comes out a bit stupid for me. This one though the stakes are high, because many injuries don't get forgotten and actually impact the state of the fight, requiring change of tactics. It helps smooth out the already chaotic mess and have you rooting for the heroes even more.As for the things that did not sit well for me, it starts a lot with the plot and the setup execution. Nobody's plot has so many questions and shallow pools of plot that it was sort of pointless for some of the decisions they made. Why is he in such a rut? What was the tension in their family? The history of his relationship with RZA? And even some antagonist stuff that had holes that made for some of the boring parts of this exciting film. The setup to get the character setup would have been better handled with some of these gaps answered to kind of put a point to the slower repetitious cycle they were using to set up Hutch's life. Past that, the movie still have some convenience moments and suspense of disbelief that sort of weaken the otherwise strategic placing of so many pieces that this film surprised me with. The final limitation, is that sometimes the violence gets a little too intense and vicious for my tastes, bypassing that fun, laughable moment into some seriously messed up moments that made my blood curdle. Those who aren't a fan of savage brutality, close impacts of deadly wounds, and horrible stabbings that make you hurt.... You need to turn away from the carnage this movie has. Does it fit with the theme of the movie, yes, but even limits need to be set for this reviewer.The VERDICT:Nobody was quite a surprise to watch this weekend. Filled with over the top action that is a mixing pot of the great movies, the film is only elevated by diversity, fun comedy that is well timed, and some clever use of these tactics to keep things fun. While the opening is a little drawn out and sort of pointless given the gaps in story, it still succeeds in getting the action kicking off though it never does answer those questions. The violence is key, but again not for those with low thresholds for this as there are some disturbing moments this film has. Nobody may not be the most convoluted, or original film, but it accomplishes the goals it set out and is very fun in executing that vision and all in 90 minutes. Was it worth a trip to the theater? Absolutely, for all the gimmicks, special effects and sequences are worthy of a visit with friends family, or even by yourself. My scores for the film are:Action/Crime/Drama: 8.5

65,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Nobody,6,26 March 2021,"In 2021's Nobody, the ""nobody"" in question is actually a somebody. I mean how is this dude able to acquire a special set of skills so quickly? Ben Odenkirk plays said nobody in the form of Hutch Mansell. Ben has never ventured into action star mode but if you squint long enough, he kinda looks like 70s Clint Eastwood or Kevin Costner a la 3 Days to Kill.So yeah, Nobody is light on story and heavy on action. It's inventive yet violently sloppy. Co-stars RZA and Christopher Lloyd (yes that 82-year-old Christopher Lloyd) join in on the shoot-em'-up fun. They supplement Hutch's need to break out of his cautious, non-combative lifestyle.Containing some tongue-n-cheek humor, featuring clips where villains bite the slow-mo dust to old school ballad music, and directed by the guy known for the gimmicky Hardcore Henry (Ilya Naishuller), Nobody chronicles husband and father Hutch Mansell (mentioned earlier). After a couple of thieves break into Hutch's home, Hutch decides to track the thieves down and eventually get embroiled with some Russian mobsters.Mansell's solution mind you, is a savage one. He vows to kick some butt and take some names. Before he beats up some riled-up ruffians, Hutch actually says, ""I hope these guys like hospital food"". Yikes!If I had to compare Nobody with anything, I'd have to say that it reminded me a little of the John Wick films. Here's the thing: Odenkirk is an affable action hero but he lacks the vulnerability and fragile nature of John Wick himself (Keanu ""Cool Breeze"" Reeves). Reeves looked like he wasn't in the best shape to fight but he prevailed like a Mack Truck anyway. Added to that, the ""Wick"" flicks are longer in length and become more defining in scope.Bottom line: If Nobody had come out before John Wick, it might have had a lesser been there, done that feel. Despite some kinetic editing and veritable fists of fury, Nobody ""doesn't do it better"".",Nobody

He incidentally attacks the son of a Russian Mafia Boss & it's then he must finish what he started after awakening a John Wick/Bryan Mills side of himself!The film is 1 hr & 29 mins of solid action that is reminiscent of John Wick, Taken & of course the end part of the film, The Equalizer (2014)! The action is intense, raw, brutal & hysterically outrageous in so many levels, not to mention funny as well!The story isn't quite what I thought it would be, but that's alright as it's great anyway & the action & sequences never let up! The bus sequence especially was nuts & the end as I mentioned above was very The Equalizer (2014) esque!The films pacing not to mention run time seemed somewhat short but that's 'cause it's so lightning quick! It also makes a change to see a film where there's great strong males leads that are for once, in this day & age, aren't made to look stupid to elevate the female ones so it's great to see this because this film is epic! The 3 males leads at the end was a great ending!Overall, this film is pure epicness! 9/10.",Nobody

68,Abdulxoxo,High octane action flick,8,7 May 2021,"Right off the bat, this movie is about a middle aged working family man played by Odenkirk who has had enough of being beaten down by the mob and taken advantage of. After several incidents, he decides to man up, and fight back against the criminals who have interfered in his life. Bob Odenkirk shows that he has what it takes to hold his own as an older action hero, bringing much conviction and self determination to his character. It's a simple yet relatable premise and situation that you found yourself on board with rooting for Odenkirk's character of Hutch as he starts to realize why he needs a gun to defend himself and his family. We get a crowd pleasing cameo from Christopher Lloyd, and man does he kick ass. The action sequences are filmed with swift camera movements allowing us to feel each hard hitting blow and gunshot in such a visceral way. I do wish the film was a tad bit longer, allowing the one dimensional villains to become a little more developed and give some more time to flesh out Hutch's relationship with Gus father, but it gave me just enough to be invested. The energy of the music really enhanced the tension of the action that is taking place, the song choice in whole, is brilliant. Overall, this is the type of guns blazing, nose breaking, fist pumping, and head shaking R rated Hollywood action movie that we rarely get to see these days. Highly recommended.",Nobody

70,arungeorge13,It's a well-crafted actioner; one that action buffs will truly enjoy! [+70%],7,16 April 2021,"Ilya Naishuller's ""Nobody"" repackages Bob Odenkirk as an ordinary man with a not-so-ordinary past, without flinching one bit when it comes to hard-hitting, superbly staged, visually appealing action. The film begins with a neatly shot montage showcasing how plain vanilla Hutch Mansell's life is. Writer Derek Kolstad thankfully wastes no time getting to the pivotal incident that reignites Hutch's ""cleaner"" persona. Thereafter it's an adrenaline-filled spotfest. There are at least a couple of clichés like Russians being the bad guys (when have they ever NOT been, is a better question to ask) and the scenario of the protagonist being in the right place at the wrong time (in this case, a bus ride).But Nobody compensates for these minor hiccups in the form of wildly captured action (Pawel Pogorzelski, of Hereditary and Midsommar, is the DOP) laced with a terrific score and a nostalgia-inducing soundtrack. Kolstad also adeptly incorporates supporting characters like Hutch's dad David (Christopher Lloyd, who's having way too much fun at 82) and brother Harry (RZA). It is to no one's surprise that Nobody feels like an extended, old-man edition of John Wick, another successful action franchise that Kolstad created. The bus fight is the kind of action movie art that will be discussed for a long, long time.At a well-paced runtime of 92 minutes, Nobody is what I'd deem a super fun viewing experience. Odenkirk does good on his part nailing both sides of Hutch with the right amounts of restraint and aggression. Will we get a John Wick and Nobody crossover at some point? Because I'd really dig that!",Nobody

When a home invasion strikes Hutch's home it triggers a long strange surreal journey trough non stop violence in the criminal underworld that only escalates with every step.Coming from John Wick alums screenwriter Derek Kolstad and producer David Leitch and directed by Hardcore Henry director Ilya Naishuller, the movie is very much in the post John Wick mold of action films with its reliance and stuntwork rather than special effects. Much like Hardcore Henry the film features an off kilter sense of dark as black humor which compliments the non-stop barrage of shootouts and fist fights that make up the film. Bob Odenkirk sells it as the lead playing both a midlife crisis suburban family man and an unstoppable killing machine often effortlessly transitioning between one and the other, it's a terrific performance from Odenkirk and brings the film to life with intensity and humor. The plot in Nobody is really something that should be experienced rather than described because it's one part comedy of errors (dark DARK comedy) and one part revenge thriller and yet that kind of undersells the movie. The movie takes us on a strange journey that feels like it's going one direction only for another element to literally crash into it and yank the rug out from under our feet.Nobody doesn't reinvent the formula that built John Wick, but thanks to some terrific direction from Ilya Naishuller and Bob Odenkirk's brilliant performance, Nobody is an entertaining ride from start to finish with good action and pitch black humor that will whet the appetites of any action fan.",Nobody

80,Holt344,Bob Odenkirk and Derek Kolstad makes it the superb action film it is,10,20 October 2021,"The director of the action film, Hardcore Henry returns with Nobody. Having only seen the trailer of Ilya Naishuller's directional debut I know he gets the action right. With Nobody he completely reinvents himself with an action film that will entertain the audience and critics worldwide with this relatable and likeable character played by Bob Odenkirk. Hutch ""Nobody"" Mansell is a docile family man, who slowly reveals his true character after his house gets burgled by two petty thieves, which, coincidentally, leads him going to a bloody war with a Russian crime boss. The supporting cast has actors like Connie Nielsen, RZA, Christopher Lloyd, Aleksey Serebryakov, Michael Ironside and Colin Salmon.Derek Kolstad wrote the screenplay and story for this film, and you should know him from being the creator of the John Wick franchise. He knows how to write a fantastic action film and it shows again with Nobody. David Leitch serves as a producer alongside with Bob Odenkirk and a couple of others. It has that superb action feeling that David Leitch and Derek Kolstad is known for. The action sequences are choreographed so well, but it's also the sets and locations that works so well in the shots. The editing is perfect and the cinematography is also quite impressive. I also want to add that the comedic moments are spot on with the actors executing it perfectly, it also helps how Bob Odenkirk is a comedian as well as an actor, I also loved the visual comedy. The script is perfect. I also Love the choice of music, mainly old and classical music which fits perfectly with the character and the overall film. Then the original musical score is also quite great. But the most impressive sound is the overall sound design.When an actor trains for two years for a role, this time Bob Odenkirk, you can truly see how this was a passion project of his. He was terrific as Hutch ""Nobody"" Mansell and having done most if not all the stunts himself, I can say that this film should appeal to fans of the action genre. Honestly, I loved every second of it and I hope you will too. This is how action should be done and I want a sequel.",Nobody

83,bankofmarquis,Lots of fun,7,27 April 2021,"Any fan of one of the greatest TV series of all-time, BREAKING BAD, or it's spin-off, BETTER CALL SAUL, know the acting chops that Bob Odenkirk brings to the role of slimey, billboard lawyer Saul Goodman. His fast-talking, fast-thinking con-man is a character for the ages.So, naturally, one would think ""action star"".But, darn it, if it doesn't work.Playing a retired undercover agent with a ""certain set of skills"", NOBODY follows ""Hutch"" Mansell as he gets pulled back into using those skills when he helps a young woman who is being harassed on a bus, only to find out the thugs he went against are connected to the Russian Mob.You can pretty much fill in the blanks from there. This film does not really tread any new ground...but...gosh...it was a fun watch.Playing a more comedic hero than Liam Neeson in the TAKEN movies or Keanu Reeves' JOHN WICK, Odenkirk, nonetheless, pulls off the ""action hero"" qualities just fine and is a winning enough presence on the screen that he holds your attention.Christopher Lloyd (yes, Doc Brown from BACK TO THE FUTURE) is along for the ride as Odenkirk's father, who gets pulled into the action when the Russian Mobsters decide to go after Hutch's family and he looks like he is having a ball with this role.The rest of the cast is pretty by-the-book (though a special shoutout needs to go to 1980's heavy, Michael Ironside, who has a short role in this film - I would have loved to have seen more of him). The head Russian mobster is a bit over-the-top for my tastes, but the action sequences more than make up for all of this.Credit for that must be given to Director Ilya Naishuller (HARDCORE HENRY) for he gives this film a unique look in the fight scenes while constantly having his tongue placed firmly in his cheek. I've seen ALOT of action films, so when a film brings something unique and fun to the screen, I sit up and notice.And, notice I did. For NOBODY is a fun, popcorn flick.

84,Vivekmaru45,"The most overrated, over-hyped movie I have seen.",1,20 April 2021,"The movie was a disappointment for me. I saw the trailer for the movie before I saw the actual movie itself. I thought this movie would be more like a vigilante movie and I love these sort of movies.But in effect this was more of a dumb backstory kind of generic Hollywood movies dished out. This follows the same case as John Wick. The first John Wick was good, but they killed it with the sequels. They should have stopped after the first one. ""I Am Wrath"" is also another good movie and better than this one.I have already seen good vigilante movies in the past. Death Wish and The Exterminator are prime examples of good movies that have survived into the present era. Vigilante 1983 starring the late Robert Forster and Fighting Back 1982 starring Tom Skerrit are also terrific.In Nobody(2021), the story follows a family man played by Bob Odenkirk(of Breaking Bad fame) who fails to stop some inept burglars from stealing his possessions. After which he has a change of heart and lashes out vigilante-style to vent out his anger. The rest of the movie deals with repercussions of his decisions.The acting in the movie is so-so.

87,abisio,Different than John Wick but plenty of fun,9,26 March 2021,"NOBODY starts with a serious but observation on how violence is embraced in American minds as routine escapism; however how little people are prepared for it when explodes. Hutch (Bob Odenkirk ) is typical person, tied up in daily routine, a failing marriage and a family that ignores him. One day his house is robbed and he does attack the robbers (when he has the chance); just ask them to leave to avoid violence. His son and almost everybody around disrespects him. Even his retired father (Christopher Lloyd great as always). However, Hutch is not what it seems. He is a extremely violent (almost sadistic) but over controlled person. When a piece of jewelry from her daughter seems missing; he goes after the thieves; but some unexpected events cause hell to break loose. As part of the John Wick team is involved, violence and carnage reach to the extreme level; however things are played mostly in a comedy manner. Odenkirk is perfectly believable as a common person and as a sadistic killer. In fact his manners and attitude did not even change that much . The movie clocks in a little under 90 minutes but there is fun enough for long time. In brief; the best thing in cinemas since the year started. Do not miss it.",Nobody
88,bob-the-movie-man,What Kevin McAllister did once all grown up,8,9 June 2021,"The ""Nobody"" in question is Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) who lives a humdrum suburban life: a 9-to-5 managerial job at his in-laws manufacturing plant; distant wife (Connie Nielsen); two kids, Blake (Gage Munroe) and Abby (Paisley Cadorath); an elderly father (Christopher Lloyd) in a local care home. Basically, the Mansell's are all living the American dream, but all subject to the monotonous grind of that daily life for week after week. That all changes in the middle of the night after Hutch confronts two bungling burglars and - in the full gaze of his son - 'wimps out' on taking action. All the silent rage and embarrassment has to go somewhere, and it does - on a late night bus ride; an event that sets off a sequence of increasingly bloody encounters!Positives:
Bob Odenkirk is charismatically dull! His character could be compared with that of Christian Wolff in 2016's ""The Accountant"". But in that movie, Ben Affleck was just dull dull! Here Odenkirk brings his character to life in a truly wonderful and sparkly way.The movie is a hyper-violent but adrenaline-fuelled joy ride. There's a slight lull after the initial burglary, but then it's a downhill bobsleigh ride with no brakes from there to the end. It comes as no surprise that the writer, Derek Kolstad, is the guy behind the John Wick franchise. The script has moments of black comedy that made me laugh out loud a good few times.The editing here (by Evan Schiff and William Yeh) is very slick indeed, most noticeably so in the many fight scenes. The one on the bus could be pulled apart as a template for a film school lesson.Negatives:
I've very little to add here. Yes, it's a rather shallow story, but I found it a hugely entertaining rush of a movie. However the intensity of the violence will not be for everyone. The lady a few seats along from me had her hands over her eyes for at least 75% of the movie I reckon.I wasn't clear where the character played by RZA fitted into the mix. Having (post film) seen the cast list, I'm even more confused!Additional notes:
There is a post credit scene in this one, shortly into the end credits, so don't dive for the doors too quickly if you want to see it. That being said, it doesn't really make much sense (why are they doing this?) and it isn't particularly funny either. So if you did miss it, then don't sweat about it!This is a movie that I knew virtually nothing about on going into it. Which is the best way to see it. As such, it's worth NOT watching the trailer, and going in on that basis if you can.Summary Thoughts on ""Nobody"": It's a pretty shallow plot.... but it's also bloody good fun! I expected this to follow the well worn road of classic ""revenge"" movies - like ""Death Wish"" or ""Taken"" - but was pleasantly surprised that it didn't. A better comparison might be Michael Douglas's ""Falling Down"", but with the central character having more heart.There are lots of nods to sequences from other movies in here: ""Home Alone"" (for obvious reasons!); ""Patriot Games"" and ""The Equalizer"" came to my mind. And the finale reminded me strongly of the anarchic chaos of 2016's ""Free Fire"".Intellectual it ain't. But provided you can stomach the Tom and Jerry style violence, and suspend your belief at the punishment Hutch can take without hospital treatment, then ""Nobody"" ticks all the boxes for a fun night out at the flicks.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

91,kjproulx,A Simple Action Thriller that Really Delivers,8,29 April 2021,"When a low-budget film comes along that simply wants to entertain its audience and ends up going above and beyond its promise, all I can do is praise it. It's rare that a film like Nobody comes out and feels similar to other movies like John Wick or Taken, while also having a completely fresh identity of its own. Honestly, I wasn't super excited for this one, given that the trailers made it look too similar to movies like the aforementioned, but I'm very glad I gave it the chance. Not only is this film possibly better than most of its kind, but I also connected with most of the characters here, and with a short 90-minute run time, that's saying a lot. Here's why I absolutely recommend checking out Nobody.The film opens with a family man, overtired and in a looped daily routine, as two people invade his home and bring out his forgotten past. Having surpassed his rage in the past and left his previous life behind, he very quickly finds himself back in the game. The film takes its time letting you know where Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) is in his life right now, which really made a bigger impact when you learn who he really is. Once this film gets going, it's pedals to the metal in terms of fights and cleverness. It does take its time to make you care about the characters, but if for nothing else, the attention to detail in the action is what will sell the movie for action buffs.Like many have already said about this film, Bob Odenkirk crushes it as Hutch. I never once thought of him as someone who would ever lead a film like this, but I'm happy to say that he did it extremely well. I always knew he was a very talented actor, but this felt like a new side of him as a performer. Yes, as the film progresses it begins to feel familiar, but it's all about whether or not you care about what is happening. It feels familiar, but fresh at the same time and I would happily watch a sequel. I just want to see more stories involving this character.Choreographing action was something director Ilya Naishuller knew all too well, after directing the film Hardcore Henry, so I wasn't really worried about that aspect going in. I'm just happy the film delivered that and then some. I would say that Naishuller has significantly improved as a filmmaker and I'm actually looking forward to his next project. I wasn't a big fan of Hardcore Henry (although I appreciate the effort), so I'm very surprised to say that.In the end, from the action to the solid enough story, my only big complaints were really just a collection of small nitpicks throughout the movie. Overall, this film lets you know what it's going to be and then delivers on its promise. Oh, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention that it was very nice to see Christopher Lloyd having a blast in a movie again. Now streaming on-demand, I highly recommend checking out Nobody, unless you're someone who is squeamish when it comes to blood.",Nobody
92,kuarinofu,"Structurally John Wick, tonally The Hitman's Bodyguard with a Russian aftertaste",7,16 April 2021,"'Nobody' is a fun and action-packed comedy reminiscent of the films I mentioned above.It is still flawed though. It shows mostly in the pacing of the film. The first part is noticeably slow and not particularly interesting besides the set-ups, the middle part is much more fun and gory but by the third act, the film just goes off the rails so the viewer may start losing any interest or investment in it. There isn't much in terms of a story, but this is expected for this type of film. Character-wise there isn't much to dig deep into either, nor the protagonist or the main villain was particularly engaging. The acting was enjoyable, it was nice to see Christopher Lloyd and Michael Ironside, a good Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov and even popular Russian singer Sergey Shnurov.As a Ukrainian myself, I am familiar with Russian pop culture and this made the film much a better experience. Some of the dialogue is way better when spoken in Russian, real Russian actors make this much more believable (plus some cameos), there is also not that much Hollywood exaggeration in terms of racial stereotypes, since this was made by a Russian director.Other than that, besides the well-filmed action, some quite pointless violence, and a couple of genuinely funny scenes (besides actually childish racial jokes), everything else is very basic and by the numbers. If you've seen John Wick, The Hitman's Bodyguard, The Accountant, The Equalizer - you know what to expect and this film won't surprise you much.Yet I think that this would've worked much better if we at least didn't have this many John Wick sequels, I personally got a little tired of these types of action films.Still a good one-time watch if you can sit through the first act to greatly enjoy the second one, only to stop caring by the end (and don't forget to watch the post-credit scene which really didn't need to be there).",Nobody

The plot was similar to the first John Wick, but Nobody's plot was better and a bit more investing. However, it was still predictable most of the time.The best aspect of the movie was of course the action. They were well-handled and brutally entertaining. Unlike John Wick, who mostly kill people pretty easily, our main character was older and weaker, so he got beat up a lot as well. After each fight scene he was in a bad shape.Even though the action scenes were entertaining, they weren't the best or having any unique elements, which was a bit disappointing.However, the most surprising part was Bob Odenkirk. His roles before this were mostly funny and wicked characters, so it was refreshing to see him becoming a sad and retired hit man who tried to protect his family, while facing his past self. Bob definitely played the new role well, and he made the movie entertaining. However, I can definitely see Keanu Reeves, Mads Mikkelsen, or Liam Neeson play this role better.Overall, it's just another generic action thriller, but Nobody was still fun and entertaining enough. 7.5/10.",Nobody
94,tm-sheehan,This new Vigilante hero film was a Bridge too Far to cross for me,5,12 April 2021,"""Nobody "" a film starring Bob Odenkirk as Hutch Mansell a vigilante who successfully channels his inner Super hero after losing the respect of his family and himself by standing passively by while his family are threatened after a home invasion was for me a bridge too far.The film is categorised as Action Crime Thriller but in my view that description should also include Fantasy . That's where it lost me it is an effective Action Crime Thriller in the first 15 minutes or so and it did have my interest but then it turns into a tongue in cheek very violent fantasy . I don't mind violence in films like Harley Quinn Birds of Prey and I enjoy the John Wick films which ""Nobody"" is heavily influenced by but to me it was like a film beginning as a musical then the director says Stop the music ! We're going to have a Drama from here on.It's just a fact of modern living that Society in general has certainly become desensitised to extreme violence whether on the nightly news ,television or films .Its obviously an audience pleaser but when film Producers glorify violence and vigilante revenge in the name of entertainment and disguise it as fantasy I think
they are enabling the violence to spill over to reality as America and the rest of the world is sadly experiencing in increasing and alarming regularity.It's obvious that we'll probably see more of this character Hutch Mansell as it seems to be a hit with many movie goers but there's two who will be missing in action next time around .Tastes are different thank goodness and very individual my ice cream sundae movie might be someone else's Lemon Sorbet and I love different views and reactions to films so let's just say as the lyrics to the opening credit song by The Animals goOh, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good

Flashy action pieces, neat inclusion of Dark humor, and a remarkable showing from Bob Odenkirk; all of it irrefutably illustrates an imposing envision. However, there are a couple of issues likewise.Being a fervent admirer of such Action emphasized ventures, needless to say; I was anxiously waiting for it. And to tell you the truth, all this wait was wholly worthwhile. Barring a few stumbling blocks; in most instances, the execution is exactly how it should be.Fit as a fiddle!A large number of people have already made heaps of comparisons with John Wick, and I admit; there is indeed a discernible likeness. Even though it falters in world-building and character depths; unlike John Wick, which had all these fundamentals ably covered! Be that as it may, it set forth to institute its own line of descent and distinct identity and we gotta respect that.There goes another of my complaint regarding the Screenplay; which gravely suffers from occasional mundane moments. Mainly due to a number of prolonged scenes of no consequence! Thereby, missing out on necessary momentum.Concerning the Technical Sides; It Is Nothing but an Utter Delight.A bodacious set of Action Setpieces with plenteous blood & gore that will leave you in awe. In particular, the 'Bus' scene; that is absolute Gold. Accompanied by a befitting Score, adding a little contemporary touch.That I Very Much Adored!Bob Odenkirk as Hutch Mansell serves as an example of pertinent casting. What a charismatic presence!

102,MrDHWong,"Provides a great amount of explosive, gun-toting entertainment that should leave connoisseurs of the genre satisfied",8,6 May 2021,"""Nobody"" is an action thriller film written by Derek Kolstad (John Wick 1, 2, and 3) and directed by Ilya Naishuller (Hardcore Henry). Starring Bob Odenkirk in the lead role, it provides a great amount of explosive, gun-toting entertainment that should leave connoisseurs of the genre satisfied.In a house at the end of a cul-de-sac, Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) lives a mundane existence with his wife Becca (Connie Nielsen) and two children Blake (Gage Munroe) and Sammy (Paisley Cadorath) while working a monotonous office job at his father-in-law's company. Being the seemingly mild-mannered man that he is, Hutch usually keeps out of trouble until one night when his house is broken into by a pair of robbers who threaten his family at gunpoint. After the thieves manage to get away, Blake berates his father for being weak, which sets off a long dormant rage inside of Hutch who is tired of being a ""nobody"" and decides to do something about the people that almost took the lives of those who mattered most to him.Vigilante films have experienced something of a boost in popularity in recent years, thanks primarily to the renaissance of superhero cinematic universes and the cult status of the ""John Wick"" series. A good example of the current recognition they are receiving was when the vigilante-themed ""Promising Young Woman"" won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay at the 2021 Oscars. Although a film like ""Nobody"" does little to reinvent this genre, it more than makes up for it with its tense action scenes and a solid performance from its main star. I think what makes the film so appealing to watch, for me at least, is the simplicity of the plot - a man who is tired of being some random unimportant guy goes off and does something about it, punching and shooting his way into a more invigorating feeling of acceptance. Anyone who longs for an exciting change of scenery from the life they lead will most certainly identify with this, albeit, in a less violent manner out in the real world. There were times where the film almost felt like it was satirising the whole genre in general, as the thing that sets our hero off was him losing the respect of his children, rather than something like the death of a best friend or a pet. Hutch is depicted as a cowardly everyman stuck in a dead end job but when his own children start to look down upon him, he finally snaps and becomes a one man killing machine to all those who stand in his way.The film borrows heavily from many other action thrillers of its kind, like the aforementioned ""John Wick"" series. In fact, after some post-viewing research, I discovered that ""Nobody"" and the ""John Wick"" films share the same screenwriter - Derek Kolstad. In addition to this, the first ""John Wick"" film's co-director David Leitch is also credited as a co-producer here. All of this explained the familiar plot elements that were being followed here: a one man army protagonist, the Russian mafia, old friends helping out where they can, creatively choreographed combat scenes, and even the main hero's love of animals. Normally I would dismiss this as lazy writing, but what separates this film from the others is that its main character seems like a regular guy you could walk past on the streets, unlike John Wick who has widespread infamy in the world of organised crime. I do feel where things fall short here is in the lack of atmosphere, which is something the ""John Wick"" movies did right. There's no proper world building and the occasional rushed pacing didn't make me feel as immersed in the story as I should have been. I also think some of the villains' motivations felt arbitrary, in that one minute they need Hutch alive and the next they are shooting at him with the intent to kill. While this did provide some great action scenes, it did have me confused as to whether he is as important to them as he has led them to believe or if he is just some minor inconvenience to be swiftly dealt with. Regardless, the film proudly wears its Wick similarities on its sleeve and fans of that series should have fun pointing that out.I always like to see actors play against their type and Bob Odenkirk certainly succeeds here. Despite being no stranger to crime thrillers, one of his best known roles is of course Saul Goodman/Jimmy McGill in ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Better Call Saul"", Odenkirk hasn't really done anything in them that could be considered action star material. In this film, Odenkirk convincingly transforms Hutch from a quiet, meek family man to a vicious, highly organised killer who makes great use of his surroundings to beat his adversaries into submission. I do think he has a future in roles like this, so long as he has a good enough script and filmmakers to work with. Also worth mentioning is Christopher Lloyd's role as Hutch's father, a retired FBI agent. Even though his screen time is limited, one of his scenes which I won't spoil made me laugh out loud. I do wish he was featured a bit more in the story, as I think there was potential for him to be a more prominent character.In spite of its glaring resemblances to the better ""John Wick"" movies, ""Nobody"" just barely manages to stand on its own. It's sure to scratch that itch for Wick fans who are anticipating the next installment in the ongoing franchise. As for this film, I definitely wouldn't mind a sequel, or if we're lucky, a crossover where Hutch Mansell and John Wick end up working together. After all, both share a near-identical creative team so a guy can dream I guess.I rate it 7.5/10.",Nobody
103,TheTruthofItIs,Unexpectedly satisfying,8,5 May 2021,"A surprisingly good Covid-era release. 9 of 10 movies I've reviewed that were released direct-to-home during this era have been an awful waste. But this one is redeemable. Veteran comedic actor Bob Odenkirk goes darkly dramatic as a meek husband/father with a violent/cryptic past. However, while witnessing a potential assault to a young girl by a foul gang of men, the beast within him arises - yes, he goes Hulk w/o the comic exaggeration, and this puts him on the wrong side of a psycho mob boss. So there's an exceeding amount of fighting, chasing, and revenging. If that's your bag, great. And there's a bit more plausibility to this since our protag and his crew do take a lot of hit points. The final scene could lead to a sequel but are we ready for Odenkirk as an underdog, underweight anti-hero? I'm thinking not so much. This works better as one and done.",Nobody

106,ronakkotian,Adrenaline fuelled fun!,7,13 June 2021,"I was very excited for this film due to Bob Odenkirk and knowing the people behind John Wick helped make it. Whilst it has its flaws, Nobody was entertaining regardless.Nobody follows Hutch Mansell, an seemingly ordinary man with a family, who fails to protect his family from two thieves that break into his home one night. One thing leads to another and he finds himself to be the target of a powerful drug lord.By no means is Nobody anything groundbreaking. In fact there are many similarities between this film and John Wick, which is not surprising considering Derek Kolstad, the writer of the John Wick franchise, also wrote this film. For me, the biggest draw towards the film is the unusual casting choice of Bob Odenkirk. I love him in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul but I would've never imagined him being an action hero. Here, Odenkirk absolutely destroys the scene. He has many funny moments but is also very entertaining to watch during the fight sequences. Not only is his performance great but I'm impressed by the amount of effort Odenkirk put in since he performs most of the stunts himself. Another actor who completely surprised was Christopher Lloyd. He's not in the film much but he does things I wouldn't expect him to do.The other reason to watch Nobody is the action. The film does take its time to build up to it but when the action starts, the adrenaline starts to kick in. If you've seen Hardcore Henry, then you know how talented Ilya Naishuller is at directing action and Nobody is no different. The action is shot and directed beautifully with many shots of blood and gore. The stuntwork is very impressive especially during the bus fight where the hand-to-hand combat looked very realistic and gritty. It's violent, it's bloody but above all, it's exhilarating. Another aspect I liked is how they didn't make Hutch Mansell a perfect fighter. There were many moments where he gets beaten down and injured badly which adds to the realism and vulnerability of the character. Nobody also works due to its lighthearted tone. There are ridiculous and over-the-top scenes but the film doesn't take itself seriously. It's very self-aware and has quite a bit of comedy sprinkled throughout which works in the film's favour.Aside from Bob Odenkirk and the action, Nobody has very weak characters. A lot of scenes are taken from John Wick which does make it seem like an inferior version of that film. Connie Nielsen doesn't have much to do but the weakest part has to be the villain. He's incredibly underdeveloped and barely has anything to do. Aleksey Serebryakov tries to make the most of it but his role is easily the most forgettable part.Nobody isn't perfect but I had a lot of fun watching it nonetheless. The exciting and adrenaline fuelled action sequences combined with Bob Odenkirk's excellent performance make Nobody a worthy watch. I would love a sequel to this or even a crossover with John Wick as that has potential to be extremely exciting.",Nobody
107,Stanlee107,Rooting for the little guys,7,23 April 2021,This anti- hero film is a film for which I had very little expectation.

His life takes an unexpected turn when during a night robbery in his house he chooses to be the pacifist whereas his son tried to intervene.... his son loses all respect for him & something within him snaps.It is very enjoyable & silly version of John Wick.

108,trinaboice,Crazy fun with an impressive Bob Odenkirk,8,14 April 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Emmy winner Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul, The Post, Nebraska) stars as Hutch Mansell, an underestimated and overlooked suburban dad and husband, taking life's indignities on the chin and never pushing back. A nobody.When two thieves break into his home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away.The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch's long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire, and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon's McMafia)-and ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again.THINGS I LIKED:
Bob Odenkirk got his start as a writer for Saturday Night Life and his comic chops show in this dark comedy. I love that he's not a perfect action hero, but just a regular guy who is flawed, but hopeful. The story idea actually came from Bob Odenkirk whose own home in real life was burglarized. He was frustrated with how the local authorities handled the case and he thought about how he wished he had been able to take care of the trespassers his own way.A lot of people are comparing this film to the John Wick franchise; however, it doesn't have quite the sophistication or depth of character development, despite being written by the same guy, Derek Kolstad. What makes this movie work is that the protagonist is the unexpected Bob Odenkirk who is surprisingly awesome in this as an action star.There are some really funny and hardcore action sequences. Bob Odenkirk did all of his own stuntwork. Like the wide-lens shots in John Wick, the fight scenes are pretty amazing to watch. The camera work is creative and really good. They practiced that bus fight scene for months! The small space of that entire sequence is super impressive. What makes Bob Odenkirk's character so appealing is that he's not a superhero. Instead, he's an ""average"" guy who takes a ton of punches, yet keeps going.Anyone who has ever seen Back to the Future adores Christopher Lloyd. He and Bob Odenkirk actually share the same birthdate (October 22nd)! Kudos to 82-year-old Christopher Lloyd who also stars in the recent William Shatner movie called Senior Moment. You can see my review of Senior Moment right here!Director Ilya Naishuller is best known for his action flick Hardcore Henry.I think a lot of people can relate to the drudgery of everyday life that puts them in the kind of rut that the protagonist finds himself in at the beginning of the film.Keep watching after the rolling credits at the end for a bonus scene.I love the movie poster.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It's over the top and completely ridiculous.A lot of scenes occur at night, so the screen is dark, which might make it difficult to watch on a small device once it goes to streaming.The villain is super weak.There isn't much character development and the entertaining aspect of Bob Odenkirk's ""everyday"" man fades by Act 3 as he reveals he has a ""certain set of skills"" that most of us regular people don't possess.The entertaining musical score during action sequences becomes a bit tired.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

115,dfle3,An absurd violent male fantasy for those who like this kind of stuff played mostly straight. 60%,6,14 April 2021,"""Nobody"" has the sense of being an intentionally unintentionally funny film. The plot concerns how when criminals invade the home of a ""nobody"", hurting his family and making him look weak in the eyes of his loved ones, they have messed with the wrong man. A copious number of additional criminals will come to the same realisation. It's as if the film was written by a teenage boy, hence the lack of realism.Bob Odenkirk plays the ""nobody"" of the title, a man called Hutch Mansell. I know Odenkirk from the quality drama series ""Breaking bad"", although his character in that has gotten a spin-off series (Better call Saul) which I haven't seen. I was going to say that the poster for ""Nobody"" reminded me of the poster for ""Kindergarten cop"" but I can't seem to find such an image online. Maybe Odenkirk also reminded me of Tom Arnold, as far as his appearance goes in that poster. Anyway, when you see Hutch doing pull-ups waiting for a bus, you realise that there may be more to this man with a seemingly humdrum life working for...is it Universal Exports? I dunno, so boring.Anyway, after his home is invaded by robbers, things quickly escalate and Hutch will soon have to be dealing with Boss Level criminals. This is part of this genre's arc...a mild-mannered man turns into a lion, redeeming himself in the eyes of his family. This is quite a violent film but I didn't find it as odious as the implied violence of ""Law abiding citizen"" Sometimes the violence is played for laughs though.The main reason I'm not scoring this film very highly is its lack of realism and the perfunctory humour and manipulation of the audience's emotions. Hutch takes a lot of punishment in this film, short of being crucified in order to fuel this homicidal fantasy, so that he can be resurrected as a God of Vengeance. That being said, it doesn't quite go to The Black Knight territory on that front though.Back to the humour in this film, I was going to call it ""dry"" but the Oxford online dictionary defines that as ""(of a joke or sense of humour) subtle and expressed in a matter-of-fact way"", so, if you remove ""subtle"" from the definition, you pretty much have it. The humour and violence may please teenage boys but that's a very low bar. If you watched the sitcom Happy Days as a child, did you find The Fonz really cool? When watching it as an adult, are you staggered at how little The Fonz had to do to seem cool? Just me? Anyway, ""Nobody"", like The Fonz, is minimalist when it comes to the humour and it is very tired in any case. For instance, there's a variation on 'the family that slays together stays together'. Some might find this 1970's level cop-show humour funny but I think it stopped being funny...back in the 1970's. A comparable film as far as the humour goes can be found in the marginally funnier ""Freaky"". I have in mind the scene where Vince Vaughn's character is in the back seat with a teenage boy (see my review of that film).It would be true to say that if I found myself in Hutch's position, it would have only taken a look by me to intimidate all those nasty criminals. Of course, that wouldn't make for a very exciting 2 minute film. This film is 92 minutes long. I shouldn't have had those couple of coffees before seeing this film. Maybe when I went to the loo a few times during the 'quiet' moments of this film, I missed some drama which grounded the story more.It seems like I'm a sucker for these kinds of films. I found the very recent ""Boss level"" a much more entertaining violent male fantasy with a sense of humour. Its star, Frank Grillo, really puts Odenkirk's pull-ups to shame just looking at his physique. As a kid, I saw the early Death Wish films. One of these days I should revisit some of those. That was a violent male fantasy played straight. Maybe it did it better too.",Nobody
116,sweidman-28016,Really Fun Time,7,1 April 2021,"""There's a long dormant piece of me that so very badly wants out.""From the makers of John Wick comes Nobody. A bystander who intervenes to help a woman being harassed by a group of men becomes the target of a vengeful drug lord. I'm reminded a lot of Game Night with this movie. They aren't even similar in plot or anything, but more my reaction (and it also came out the same time of year). I saw the trailer a couples times and had no interest in this. The reviews came in very high which made me want to see this, though my expectations still weren't nearly as high. Surprisingly, I enjoyed this. Do I think it's as great as many think? Not necessarily, but this is pretty good. What Nobody does extremely well is making it a really fun time. With its shorter runtime, constant action, and good comedy, I don't know how you couldn't have a fun time. The violence does get very gory which some may not like, but the experience is still fun. I really liked the action. You can definitely tell this is from the makers of John Wick with its style. The director isn't the same, but it feels almost the same in execution. We have this badass man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Bob Odenkrik was a fantastic choice to play Hutch. He has that perfect mix of serious and comedic persona so that we have a positive connection with him.The story is nothing new. You can tell where it's going to go. I wanted a little bit of something different in story. The villain is very cliche, but still makes sense for the story. Once again, nothing new. Part of the script does go to explain some background information, and I would've liked slightly more with this as well, though I do believe this will turn into a series so more can be explored. I missed the after credit scene but I feel that might confirm more to come with the movie. The visual style looks great. There's nice location changes, some with neon lights that pop out. The soundtrack is really good. All of the songs fit perfectly. I'm not sure what else there is to discuss. Nobody is just a quality action movie that we didn't know we needed.

Director Ilya Naishuller let's his camera pull back allowing the audience to see all. There's no quick cut editing. Odenkirk in particular shines and upstages some serious martial arts stars in this movie. Both Alain Moussi and Daniel Bernhardt feature in the Bus fight scene. Bernhardt being credited as fight choreographer for the production. He does a sterling job too. Odenkirk is by no means an Action star but here he looks every bit believable. His character sheds off the rust throughout the course of the movie as the old skills re-emerge.It's laughable that the latest 'Mortal Kombat' movie is released around the same time as 'Nobody' featuring some credible Martial arts stars. It is Naishuller's film that serves up the more brutal and enjoyable fights featuring a comedic actor dishing out the arse kickings!With good Direction, editing and script it seems we no longer need a jacked up beef cake or Black belt 7th Dan to make a believable action movie.

Bob Odenkirk is pitch perfect in the role and I need to see him do more roles like this, his physicality he brings to the role is astounding and he also has the comedic timing for the lighter moments of the picture. It's very reminiscent of John Wick which isn't surprising seeing as it comes from the creator of those films and I can see some people saying it's a bit too much like John Wick but if you love those films like I do, you're not going to complain about getting more of the same. A future action cult classic I think. Will definitely be returning to this one in the near future.",Nobody

128,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,10,21 April 2021,"Good Morrow, countrymen.Solid action flick featuring Bob (It's All Good, Man) Odenkirk (as Hutch) . As a fan of Better Call Saul/Breaking Bad how could this miss, right? Plus, the cover art is intriguing.A lot of other reviews compare this to John Wick - I can see that, to me, it seems like a reasonable comparison. I'll leave that debate to others who actually care if it's too close or not. For me, I don't care.The story here is shallow, the characters are underdeveloped clichés.Hutch - an average work-a-day Joe Family, lives life by routine. His wife Becca (played by Connie Nielsen, an actress I find lacking) in a role that could have been played by anybody. Add one teenage son who, of course, is a moody loser. Hey bro, take out the garbage....and the biggest cliché of them all - the cute little girl who just wants her kitty kat bracelet. Of course, the whole initial set-up is to portray him as just a normal guy thus giving Acts 2 and 3 more of a jolt. (Like Wick, a Nobody sequel won't have the same magic; we already know they have skills)The set-up is simple: Hutch confronts two hapless home invaders in a poorly planned heist that Hutch, along with his teenage son, had an opportunity to overpower. However, Hutch doesn't act and instead lets them go. The fallout of his passiveness is mockery by everyone in his life. Eventually, Hutch can't take it anymore and sets out to find the two who attack him in his home...he quickly catches up to them and his ready to deliver some punishment but is halted by the sound of crying baby who is breathing through an oxygen mask. In a moment of heartstrings and understanding, he doesn't beat them to a pulp because they were desperate. He does recover his daughter's bracelet though.He leaves full of adrenaline, jumps on a city bus and has luck would have it, a gang of central casting drunk thugs with neck tattoos get on board and immediately start intimidating a young woman. Hutch, still amped up simply won't stand for that - heck, he already did one good deed, might as well make it a double. This is where we truly see what sort of skills Hutch has got...and they're considerable. Needless to say, he mows through all of them even leaving one with a crude tracheotomy using his soda straw. Turns out that guy is in the Russian mob and the Russian Mob leader is angry. Hardcore Hutch time.We learn some of Hutch's backstory in a ham-handed exposition dump scene where he tells a dying Russian gangster what he used to do. You might have heard it all before...Three letter agency guy, who you don't wanna see at your door, blah blah blah - government assassin stuff. Yeah, okay - I guess some explanation was needed, but c'mon - nothing more original? Add to that another scene where Hutch spares the life of a man sentenced to die at his hand only because the Director needed a scene to explain why Hutch left his former life as a bad hombre for a quiet home life with a wife and kids.Despite some minor grumbles, this was a solid time killer, some great humor and inventive fight scenes. Of particular note, is the great Christopher Lloyd as Hutch's elderly father - the two doing battle against a small army of Russian thugs at the end is absolutely fantastic.Of course, I have some issues, but overall this movie delivers entertainment.The main critics of this film are disappointed that it portrays the Russian Mob as bad guys and thus, perpetuate stereotypes...instant down vote. If you're so woke that portraying the mob (regardless of what country they're from) as violent somehow offends you - downvote away. For each downvote this review gets, I'll know that a SJW has been annoyed and NOBODY gets 10 stars just for that. Cheers.For everyone else who doesn't approach an action flick with an agenda - High recommend (with a few small caveats, of course).Fare thee well, it's hoecakes and Madeira time.",Nobody

131,fciocca,Basically the funnier version of John Wicked.,6,17 April 2021,"I really liked ""Nobody"". Action sequences are smooth and very dynamic. I could clearly see from miles away that this movie was heavily inspired by ""John Wick"", and the it is not scared to show this: just take a look to the poster, and compare it with the one of the second Wick's franchise installment. However they have managed to do something somewhat different. It is a piece of pure entertainment and it does well his job: it is just one hour and a half, perfect runtime, it has a straightforward plot, focusing mostly on Hutch and the bad guy. It is a fun watch that I highly recommend with friends or family.After acting for years as Saul Goodman, it is refreshing to see Odenkirk playing different roles. He does a good job, he managed to bring to life a very simple character in an interesting way. Very happy to see in the cast also Christopher Lloyd, which add a little bit of comedy.There is really nothing more to say: ""Nobody"" might not be particularly original, but if you want to watch a simple and solid movie, enjoying some pure action, this is a good choice.",Nobody

133,DeBBss,"They had a great idea, but couldn't develop an original plot around it",6,30 June 2021,"The thing about Nobody is that with every new act, it gets worse and worse. The first act setup Hutch Mansell as a ""nobody"", but we then find out that he's strangely good at hand to hand combat when he fights a group of men in a bus. Immediately it gets you guessing, who is this ""nobody""?Then we get act two, which is a little disappointing but still decent nonetheless. We learn more about his past, and apparently he worked for some secret organization and he killed people. Seriously? You couldn't have made up something more unique? At least give some more exposition, because his past is so unnecessarily vague. But, at least the action scenes were still pretty good, but not nearly as good as the bus fight.Now the third act, which was when this movie literally became a John Wick clone. It copied the muscle car fight/chase scene from John Wick. It also copied the gun-play and combat from John Wick. It was at this point where I released that this whole movie is a John Wick clone. The story is exactly the same; a retired killer coming back to kill a Russian mobster. It also copied how that same Russian mobster sends his goons to the hero's house in the middle of the night. And it copied the money burning scene.But, although it is a John Wick clone, Nobody does have some good qualities. It has great acting, and Bob Odenkirk is literally great at everything he does. Great directing and pacing, with well choreographed action scenes. Everything was solid to okay, except for the fact that it's missing its originality.Nobody started off as a 7, maybe an 8 if it further improved. Now Nobody is a 6, maybe a 5 if you really hate copy-cat movies. It's actually quite a good movie, but since it's lacking originality, I'm keeping it at a 6.",Nobody

Nobody is about a man called Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) an underestimated and overlooked dad and husband, when two thieves break into his family home, and he decides not to fight back his family is disappointed in him. The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch's long simmering rage, putting him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills.I had an absolute blast with Nobody! It had a few flaws but it was such an entertaining film. The cinematography was creative and fun, I loved the editing and fast pacing. The opening was a lot of fun, and introduced great character conflict. Whilst also setting up development for the main character well. The film did a good job at explaining the reason behind the main characters actions in the beginning. The film was also really funny and had a very fun tone. With a witty and quick paced script. The rising of tension and action sequences were hard hitting and excellently choreographed, on par with John Wick, which this film was influenced by. The soundtrack and set up for character depth was great. With a fun villain, and good connection between him and the main character. The cast had fantastic chemistry, there was also some good character background. The performances were great, Bob Odenkirk did a fantastic job here. I loved the development to the plot, and the main character was really interesting in how he thinks in certain situations and balancing his different motivations. I thought the final act was incredibly entertaining and the final action sequence was incredible, with a clever link back to the beginning. Whilst also doing a good job at setting up a possible future franchise which I want to see.However, for me it had a slightly weak set up for the action to take place. I thought the movie lacked a proper connection between the main character and his family, they set up some character depth but it never paid off. I thought the tone occasionally slipped into being corny and over the top, and certain characters had the function of the Deus Ex Machina and randomly appeared in the final act to help the main character.So overall, Nobody is an extremely entertaining action film. That is hard hitting with its action but never takes itself too seriously, despite sometimes slipping into a more corny tone. And there was a slight missed opportunity for more depth within the family, but the cast had enough chemistry to make it work and Bob Odenkirk was fantastic. What could have been a generic action film, was elevated by the action and creative cinematography.",Nobody

But of course he has to be a super skilled elite soldier. It's very reminiscent of Law Abiding Citizen in that regard.The action is OK, but honestly nothing spectacular you haven't seen dozens of times before. Bob Odenkirk is good.

136,gavinp9,Fun action shoot-em-up,7,5 April 2021,"'Nobody' is a unassuming-man-becomes-vengeful-killer film, in the vein of 'Taken' and 'John Wick'. However, it definitely has a little more tongue-in-cheek thanks to Bob Odenkirk and his comedic timing/delivery. Hutch (Odenkirk) is an accountant with a wife, Becca (Nielsen) and two kids and regular visits to his elderly Pops (Lloyd) - nothing to see here. Until their home is broken into, which leads to a string unravelling and Hutch reverting to some long-buried tendencies.Does a good job of setting the scene, showing that Hutch has been leading a normal life and not working undercover for the CIA or anything - it's just unfortunate that he's led into a war with the Russian mafia and Yulian (Serebryakov). There's not a whole heap that's new or revolutionary, and there's plenty of action and violence, but nothing too gratuitous or insane.It's fast-paced, doesn't overstay it's welcome, with a satisfying ending a a great soundtrack, adding to some of the underlying not-too-seriousness. Great support cast of Nielsen, Munroe, Cadorath, RZA, Mengesha, Ironside and the always-a-pleasure-to-watch Christopher Lloyd, still going strong at 82.

141,flicklover,Not impressed....maybe I just don't get it?,6,3 April 2021,"When I saw the trailer for this film I was not particularly interested in seeing it. It just seemed like another self aware, wink at the camera action movie. I have liked many of these films but am weary of them now. I am getting a little tired of this type of action film. But, it has gotten some good reviews so I decided to give it a chance.Well I did, and my feeling that I wouldn't like it much was confirmed. It is exactly what I thought it would be Bob Odenkirk plays Hutch. A sermingly average guy with a wife and 2 kids leading a ho-hum life. He as a boring office job in his father-in-law's metal fabrication company. One night, a man and a woman break into his house and demand money. He tries to stop the burglars but eventually let's them go. It seems that he is bothered by that and begins to unravel. It turns out that Hutch was an assassin call ed ""auditor"" for government agencies. A specialist in eliminating problems. So.his violent past comes back to haunt him. He beats up some Russian guys on a bus in spectacular fashion to take his frustration out. Unfortunately, one of them is the brother of a Russian mafia enforcer so he goes after Hutch.All of this happens with the predictable action style we've seen before over and over again for years. This film is produced by the team that does John Wick so the action is very flashy and over the top. But here, it's done with tongue fully in cheek and wink, wink at the camera. I did chuckle a bit but it becomes tedious after a while. The choice of Bob Odenkirk is part of tge joke. He doesn't look like he could kick butt but he can, and he handles himself well but it all feels like berb there, done that. The villain is very stock, even though he likes to sing karaoke!!!

Real strong people don't act tough, don't walk in slow motion, and are actually capable of smiling.The fight scenes are about him acting tough before hand, only for him to get hit repeatedly during each fight (as pictured on the movie poster).

But once again the Russian mobsters get in his way, they seem to be everybody's favorite mobsters recently. Well you can't blame this one for being over original, but on the other hand it's very, very professional. And it makes a bigger effort to keeping it real. Just like John Wick Hutch Mansel gets hurt and keeps on going, there's great care to exclude bystanders from being in harm's way, so we can't complain they didn't get hurt, they were pushed to a hiding place. Supporting cast is first class, for me, the entire movie was worth the ticket price just so I could see the mad spark lit up Christopher Lloyd's eyes - no one does it better.Bottom line it's violent, it's quick paced it's well written superbly acted and I already stated that I don't rate originality so very high.

He is an average father and husband, trying to live a peaceful life with his family. When unsolicited events threaten his peaceful family life, he is forced to return to his dark past. So he ends up facing a Russian drug lord, who is now after him and his family. In order to protect his family, he must learn his fist and weapon techniques again.Nobody is written by the creator and writer of the John Wick film series. Because of this, the films sometimes come across as a copy of these films. The biggest difference with this film and the John Wick films is that the main character has to pick up his old fighting techniques again. He also incurs damage in his fight against criminals. This makes the film a bit more realistic compared to the John Wick films, but the film loses this realism when Hutch masters his fighting skills again.The problem with this movie is that the main character lacks a real good reason to get back into action and take on the criminals. In similar action movies like John Wick or Taken, the main character had a better reason to go head-to-head against a criminal organization.Director Ilya Naischuller only directed the action movie Hardcore Henry for this film. In that film he chose to film everything from the first person perspective of the main character. With Nobody, he gets the chance to portray an action film as most action films are portrayed. He does this in a good brutal way, but apart from a few action scenes, the action in the film is not that special. Thanks to the similar script, some action moments are a bit like action moments from the John Wick moviesWhat helps the most in getting the action across well in the film is the casting of Bob Odenkirk in the lead role of the film. He plays his other movie and TV roles a little differently than in this movie, but still plays the part in a good way. He came up with the idea for this film himself after witnessing a burglary at his own house and disagreeing with how the authorities handled this case.

But the movie still manages to have its own identity. Hutch Mansell(Bob Odenkirk) is your everyday nobody with his repetitive daily routine and mundane job. Ridiculed and never fighting back things takes a dramatic turn on a bus ride home when he pick a fight with the wrong men and we find out that he isn't a nobody. Bob odenkirk is a great chose he gives off the average man look but still comes off as someone you believe can actually go and do these things. The Hollywood idea of having these more recognizable faces like Liam Nelson or Dwayne Johnson in everything makes it more difficult to separate the actors from the character because at the point it just blend numerous roles together. The movie provides a mix of realism to its action. Hutch is more of the traditional action hero he's remarkable but not invincible he gets his fair share of blows in but is shot and stabbed. It make him more relatable. The villain doesn't really offer anything all that interesting. When your first introduced to him there's a dance number going on felt as if they were giving him more personality, but then he quickly delves into that typical Russian mob boss. The similarities to John wick come from the fight between mobsters different being it wasn't the mobster who provoked first. One of the cons is that the rest of the cast doesn't offer much the movie keeps the focus on Hutch which is good but when you have his family just there not offering much your not invested. The father david(Christopher Lloyd) it seem as if there should have been another scene prior, however you does get his moment near the end.

162,darkreignn,A ton of fun - one of the best action movies in recent years,8,31 March 2021,"The thing that surprised me the most about ""Nobody"" was how consistently fun it was from beginning to end. With a badass soundtrack that reverberates throughout its action sequences, a kinetic editing style, and gloriously brutal action, ""Nobody"" immediately sets itself apart from the competition.Yes, ""Nobody"" has good action. A brisk 90-minute running time means the film has no time to waste, so it throws you into the fray early, but not before setting up a relatable, sympathetic character in Bob Odenkirk's Hutch Mansell. Hutch lives a relatively boring, normal life - he works 9 to 5, he goes home to his family, he eats dinner, sleeps, and does the same thing again the next day. It's a life that's all too familiar to many of us, except for one little difference: Hutch has a particular set of skills, and he's itching to use them again. And one night, his opportunity arises when two burglars break into his house and assaults his family. But, Hutch refrains from letting his inner psycho loose, and that repression of his natural instincts is the tipping point that sets him on a collision course headed straight toward a group of dangers, bloodthirsty, and exceedingly well-dressed Russian gangsters.Bob Odenkirk is a huge reason why this film is as entertaining as it is. He plays the everyday man so convincingly that there is no way you won't be able to connect with him unless you've never worked a soul-sucking 9 to 5 before. And when he gets to let loose and lay pain on others, not only is his switch from everyday guy to hardcore killer believable, but also the action looks incredible. Everything is filmed in steady takes and wide shots, letting you really revel in the brutality. Also, during one of the first fight sequences on a bus, the music cuts out while Bob is engaged in battle, which was such an effective technique as it almost made the scene play out like a horror film, as Bob is obviously bloodthirsty and aching to fight someone. All of the action in this movie looks great, and it's also creative in as much as Bob employs a variety of weapons and techniques to dispose of his opponents. Plus, the short running time means that the action never gets boring, which is a problem that certain other recent movies have (*cough, ""John Wick 3"" *cough*) had.Look, there's really not much else to say - if you like action movies, you'll definitely like this. I saw it in a packed theatre (as packed as a theatre can be with current coronavirus mandates) and everyone was laughing whooping, and having a great time. Sure, ""Nobody"" may not have the freshest plot in the world, but it's so stylish, entertaining, and fun that you won't be able to help yourself from enjoying it. Bob Odenkirk is the action here we never knew we needed, until now. So please, bring on ""Nobody"" part 2.",Nobody

167,itsbobr,"If you like John Wick, you will like Nobody",9,23 June 2021,"During a home Burglary Hutch (Bob Odenkirk) does nothing to protect his family and they are quite disappointed in him. His son Blake looks at him as a coward, but Hutch was just trying to keep the damage to a minimum. Angered he goes to his father's Nursing home and retrieves his FBI badge and gun (from another life) and then he goes to Tattoo parlors to find out who belongs to a Tat he noticed on one of the assailants. On his way home he encounters drunken Russian gangsters on a bus who have eyes for a pretty girl seated on the bus. Long story short he takes care of them. The Russian Drug Lord and Mob Boss Yulian (Aleksey Serebryakov) cannot believe one man did this to his men and he vows to kill Hutch.Okay, John Wick is an Assassin for hire and Hutch it not, but he will have his moments and what we will see is every bit as entertaining as a John Wick movie.If you are not familiar with Bob Odenkirk, he is the lead character in the TV show Better Call Saul.The Choreography for the fight scenes are done by the people who did John Wick.Notables: Connie Nielsen as Becca, Hutch's wife; Christopher Lloyd as David, Hutch's father who lives in a Nursing home; Gage as Blake, Hutch's son; Paisley Cadorath as Abby, Hutch's daughter; Colin Salmon as The Barber, who tells Hutch all about bad guy Yulian; RZA as Harry, Hutch's brother-in-law.You will see Yulian as a song and dance man and some of his gang lets him know that is not worthy of a man in his position. To which Yulian almost kills one of them to prove he is worthy.There are other songs (I counted 3) in here and they are not bad, but kind of unnecessary and unexpected, but I did like Louis Armstrong's It's a Wonderful World.

168,TheVictoriousV,A sublime experience and not just for the dudebros who keep praising it,7,30 May 2021,"Five years ago, Russian music producer Ilya Naishuller took me and my film-going posse by storm with Hardcore Henry, easily one of the niftiest, bloodiest, and most consistently entertaining action movies of its decade. After that film, I immediately began to await Naishuller's next project, but time went on and he began to fade from my consciousness.Suddenly, an action-thriller named Nobody emerged, and I observed that many a cinephile were in ecstasy over it - mainly, I assumed, because it starred national treasure Bob Odenkirk. Then I checked the director... What do ya know? Ilya Naishuller! The time had come!In the movie, family man Hutch Mansell (Odenkirk), having moved on from his former life as an assassin for the CIA, fails to intervene when burglars break into his suburban home, causing many of the neighbors to view him as a decidedly weak father figure. Soon enough, he steals his elderly father's FBI gear to track down the perpetrators and later decides to ""prove himself"" by taking out his frustration on a gang of rapists. This throws Hutch into the underworld, where his true purpose seems to reveal itself.Throughout it all, we see many talented faces, including Aleksei Serebryakov (best known for starring in Andrey Zvyagintsev's Leviathan), Connie Nielsen, Michael Ironside, and good old Christopher Lloyd, playing a slightly less believable grampa than the sickly geezer he portrayed in 2016's I Am Not a Serial Killer. Odenkirk carries the whole thing expertly; we laugh at him, we pity him, and we want for him to succeed. He's not an action star, and yet he gradually becomes one.So yes, both critics and common movie-goers (at least the ones in my cinephilic Facebook groups) seemed to adore the film, and their praise is mostly on-point. But of course, there are some peculiar sub-categories of the general public who might've fallen in love with the film, and the aforementioned development of Hutch, for the wrong reasons.On the Twitter account ""Hot Masculinity Takes"", which catalogs various dudebro posts about how true manliness is under siege from Big Feminism (because not wanting men to act like rape-prone, violence-seeking neanderthals is the same as eroding the role of the father, or something) and how everything they happen to suck at is a gay thing to be good at anyway, I noticed that Nobody was a new favorite among said dudebros. A screencapped review from IMDb called it an ""antidote against the woke agenda"" and asserted that action flicks with this much testosterone rarely get made anymore - instead, it's all misandry and Female Power Fantasy (Birds of Prey, Captain Marvel, Charlies Angels, et cetera).Ignoring the fact that several male-led and, indeed, thunderously violent action films still do get made, I must wonder if Nobody constitutes yet another Fight Club scenario. Did these men miss the point, and is there even a point to be missed?Is it telling us straightforwardly - without irony - that this is the life that the ideal man must thrust himself into, lest he fail his patriarchal duties, or is it a dark satire (of pro-gun rhetoric, the John McClane-era nostalgia felt by Hutch as well as the viewers, and whatever else)? Maybe it's neither. Maybe it simply meant for us to be entertained (which it succeeds at, despite being occasionally predictable). Let's face it: movie violence is fun, no matter how the work in question ultimately feels about it.I think Fight Club is more legibly satirical of the idea that male self-actualization must come with the unleashing of primal violence (continually suppressed by ""them"", whoever ""they"" might be), whereas the most outstanding things about Nobody lie in its technical mastery, its creative set-pieces, its palpably brutal scenes of violence, and the sheer personality of its editing, not to mention the performances. Thus, I guess it makes sense that the film would find its way into the manosphere. I'm happy for them, though. The movie was lots of fun. It's no Hardcore Henry but what film is?",Nobody

This is pure fun, and entertaining over-the-top carnage that can only be pulled-off successfully by a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously (in contrast to Denzel Washington's self-righteous crap, or to the unbelievable antics of ""Taken"").Others may disagree, but the weakest link for me here is the star.

178,sirwillisiv,Saul Goodwick!,7,4 July 2021,"Nobody is pretty much John Wick but with Saul Goodman at the helm. Well, for the most part. I mean the writer of John Wick also wrote Nobody's screenplay, but there is significantly less action than expected but when it does pick up, the film is a delight.Short and sweet and boasting a noir edge, Nobody drenches itself in absurdity and delivers the thrills in a stylishly offbeat fashion. It just takes a bit to get there. The film is a lot more talky than your usual action fare and experiments with eccentric means of violence to get those unique kinds of reactions out of the audience, like the shock laughs or the blank stare followed by a ""well, that happened."" It's far different from something like John Wick, which is always on the go and stacking up its body count. Nobody meanders more but it pays off nicely and you'll surely look back at how madcap it was.Don't expect any complexity from the bad guys. They're just as cookie cutter as ever. Bob Odenkirk saves the film in my opinion. He proves to be a solid action star; legitimately intimidating but sustaining a smooth charm, unassuming as the character that he plays. It was a smart move placing a comedian in this role as opposed to a typecast celebrity like Vin Diesel or Jason Statham. It made the more flippant moments in the set pieces all the more fitting and memorable. Despite a slow pace, Nobody is pure, undemanding joy and adrenaline. Grab some popcorn, kick back and watch Jimmy McGill knock some heads over. It's a rush, and a weird one.",Nobody

195,arabnikita,Slick and entertaining,7,27 March 2021,"Bob Odenkirik is the last person I was expecting to see in an action movie and it is the main reason why I was curious to watch it. He plays a family man who is stuck in perpetual routine of lowly existence of a Nobody. Then one event sends him on a rampage that will eventually lead up to a confrontation with the Russian mob. And seeing that Microsoft Excel is part of his daily routine, no wonder he had so much rage bottled up inside of him.Normally, American movies portray the Russian mob quite poorly but this time it's a whole different story because the director comes from the same country. As a result, there is plenty of authenticity when it comes to the dialogue and mannerisms. The writer is the same guy who wrote John Wick so naturally the movie is filled with parallel themes. One big difference is that here we have Odenkirk instead of Reeves and that will either make it or break it for you.The movie's biggest selling point is obviously the fast pace and the slick action scenes; you won't need to wait too long to see what I mean.

That's basically ""Nobody"" summed up in a nutshell, and fans of Odenkirk who know what they're getting themselves into won't be disappointed. The film's plot centers around Odenkirk's character getting revenge on perpetrators responsible for a home invasion. I won't get into any more details, but suffice it to say it gets increasingly gonzo and outlandish as it goes on. Having always been a fan of Odenkirk as an actor, he's great here. His character is presented as an ordinary everyman, but he has a clear charisma while with his family and also manages to come off as a real badass during the action scenes. It's not a role that requires much emotional range, but he always gives it his all in character, as is to be expected from him. The film's over-the-top action scenes are extremely well-choreographed and creative. They're pretty vicious too, including a hard-hitting, almost hard to watch action set piece on a public bus. You can tell the stunt and fight training that went into them is terrific. As far as the film's aesthetics go, the cinematography and editing are both really strong. The film always looks sleek visually, and the action scenes and montages are able to use quick cuts in very clever ways. There are some solid uses of dark comedy to give the film's tone a bit of bite and a sense of distinctness compared to some of the other ""vigilante""-style modern action movies. I also loved the film's rock-filled soundtrack, and the music is effectively and creatively used at all the right moments throughout the movie--including action choreography sometimes being properly set to them. The main flaw of ""Nobody"" is that its plot is rather formulaic. Even though the execution of the film (action scenes, style, lead actor) is pretty good, the concept certainly screams ""been there, done that."" There's a plot trope that ends up getting thrown into the narrative a bit late that also comes across as rather dull. That said, the film's other elements are strong enough to definitely make it recommendable to genre-film aficionados. It's not going to be for everyone, but action fans will have a blast, and if you think it's for you, you're probably correct. 7/10Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema. The film looked and sounded pretty good in Dolby, although the rumble effect was not really used much during the movie. Overall, I would say that the film's presentation in Dolby was solid, but not exceptional like the Dolby experiences I have had for some other films in the past.",Nobody

What did you expect.Depressing... I guess if you don't have any type of dark sense of humor what so ever, then yes.. This film is going to be a depressing kill fest and you should avoid it.Speaking of kill fests... How can anyone complain a action film like this is too violent. If this genre of film doesn't usually interest you, why watch it.. or if it was a random pick and you didn't know what you were getting in for, why not turn it off as soon as Old Bob starts the mayhem on the bus?

The fight scenes are thrilling, bloody, gruesome, and they never hold back. The action works amazingly with the setting they take place in, and work around their environment beautifully. The stunts are choreographed gorgeously, Bob Odenkirk even does his own stunts!The plot, even though it starts off slow in the first 20ish minutes, it really picks up the pace and really stays on beat all the way until the end. It's very well directed and even has a stellar score!Bob Odenkirk is amazing in this, this isn't a roll you'd typically expect him, but he kills it.Christopher Lloyd steals the show though and I couldn't help but fall in love with his character.Overall this is an amazing action film with a good story and some stunning action.Although it's comparable to John Wick, it still has enough in it to be super fresh and enjoyable.",Nobody
214,justinwfirestone,Needs more swearing and more RZA,6,20 April 2021,"I would pay about ten dollars just to watch Bob Odenkirk swear for a few minutes. I thus probably got my money's worth from watching Nobody, a movie which dares not mess with the standard plot of a guy who used to kill a bunch of people, who wishes to lead something called a normal life, who does Not Want to Talk About It, who has some super perception and mutant-like ability to take knife wounds.Think of Unforgiven meets Taken, and those two get married and have some kids who are A History of Violence and Rambo: Last Blood. We also get to see Christopher Lloyd chew up some scenery while his octogenarian beauty reminds us he could have totally played Uncle Fester sans makeup.Running a fleeting moment past 90 minutes, Nobody knows its schtick is stale, making it all the more unfortunate that we did not get more screen time with RZA. Some of the attempts at humor would have seemed bland even decades ago, and one can only wonder what the dialogue might have looked like if Odenkirk, Lloyd, and RZA were allowed to beat each other up with witticisms instead of stabbing bad dudes with stabby stuff.",Nobody

The pace was perfect, I loved the action scenes, I loved the acting, even though some of the fight scenes were very impossible, you still enjoy it because of how likeable Hutch character is. I loved his vulnerability when it came to his wife and kids.

A story that is as simple as it is banal, but which manages to entertain in its intent and in its simplicity.

This kind of horse has already been beaten to death with movies like ""Austin Powers"" and ""True Lies."" Bob Odenkirk plays an ex-government secret agent brought out of retirement by some bad Russian gangster dudes. It basically copies the ""Home Alone"" sort of chase-through-a-maze combined with some John Woo-style shoot around the corner action combined with some ""Fate of the Furious"" action. I didn't really feel a sense of peril in this one. Nothing about this made me care for the characters. There's no way an old man like Christopher Lloyd would have a chance against the type of assassins he was up against! This was just chock full of cliches. The only one it didn't break (thank God) was the ""Cool guys looking at explosions"" cliche - Bob Odenkirk did, in fact, briefly turn around to watch his own house burn down!

218,chi_town_fed,Fairly boring satire,5,27 July 2021,"Nothing innovative here. Predictable from credits to credits. There are some funny elements to this movie. I view it as a spoof on action films, or satire, which is why I did not deduct more points in my rating.I waited until I watched everything worth watching before renting this movie. Although it isn't the worst movie I've seen, it lacks anything memorable.If you don't watch this movie you are not missing anything as this movie fails to deliver. I see what they were going for but they didn't achieve it. The nonsense with the pillow wall along with several other things were supposed to be funny, I guess. It just looked odd versus funny. The family's lackluster reaction after coming out of the basement is synonymous with my lackluster response to this movie. Also, you would expect people, especially children, who are not accustomed to seeing dead bodies to be a lot more animated and flabbergasted when they do see one (or several) versus just seemingly somewhat surprised and then shrug it off. That was one of many poorly directed scenes.I have no feelings for this movie, good or bad. I didn't like it or hate it. It was just there. Watching this movie is like drinking water when you are not thirsty or rinsing soap off of your hands. You just do it without much thought or feeling. I do not recall a single memorable moment from this movie. I also sometimes wonder if Russians and Italians get tired of seeing themselves portrayed as mobsters here in the US in virtually every movie like this. Can you imagine growing up and seeing your culture consistently demonized by Hollywood for decades with no end in sight? ""Hey. Let's make another movie where the hero fights an Eastern European or Italian mob."" ""That's brilliant!""

With him, we get the bonus of watching an actual versatile actor (spanning comedy skits, drama, independent films) who now happens to be putting on the moves that long-belonged to the likes of dreamboats Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves. Kicking this off late in his 50s, he is sure to give Liam Neeson a run for his money. I hope there are more ""everyday-man"" action movies in Odenkirk's future.

Aleksey Serebryakov has fun as the villain but his reasons for what he does are quite weak, Cone Nielsen plays a distant wife but we never learn why she feels the way she does about Odenkirk and RZA, an actor who comes in towards the end of the film simply enters out of nowhere without us ever really learning what he's about. A lot of these characters have backstories alluded to but we never really learn their motivations or what makes them tick, still most action films don't flesh out their characters and when the rest of the film brings a grin to your face it's excusable if a couple aspects don't hold up. 8/10 Thoroughly Enjoyable with a Couple Weak Links.",Nobody

Cliche´s on it's own aren't necessarily bad, but making them worse than in contemporary movies where they are allready bad is not good (John Wick, The Accountant, Jack Reacher and whatever movie that gimmicks McGyver'esque techniques and apply them in killing - similar to Shoot em up).This movie badly needed a Jet Li'esque main character or a down toned plot with less violence and stealthier methods.Note!The cinematographical homage to the shining (possibly as a pre-shooting confirmation for those looking for easter eggs in trailer which isn't unheard of - Locke and Key taking it to the extreme in theire trailer where a badly hidden secret link led to another clip from the series in which certain frames on the lock you could read a simple 4 digit code and on the key another word - i did not go through the whole thing and left it there), in a clear shot of the pan out within the corridor.Pro's

Token black guy is played by RZA.Yes some of the hand to hand is quite nice, but you need a faster and more atheltic guy to make it feel realistic so that the punches hit when they need to and the supporting cast does not need to hold back. That is also a sign of bad stunt coordinator or the like, if the supporting cast has to hold back from what is realisticaly viable - decrease the number of people in the fight scene, simple as pie.So could i buy Bob Odenkirk as a retired stealthy assassin, sure.

The bad guys have exceptionally poor aim .. so much that it must be a very special effort not hitting.The first side plot-line seems absolutely irrelevant for the story - and in the very end of it .. in hindsight - we can probably put the blame squarely and confidently on the bus driver (for she made a decision that was absolutely against any logic and put it all in motion).That aside .. the action itself was - fine. Not exceptional. There was no real style to it. The camera work was just the bare default.

To sum up, a great action packed creative movie that will keep you entertained. 8/10 Don't miss that one.",Nobody
251,tvdefrancesco,Let Sleeping Dogs Lie,9,1 April 2021,"This movie was great. I love the line he uses when he's showing off the stack of cash. ""There are 3 people in this world....then there's the third people like me who are begging with every fiber in their being that you try and take this money from me!"" Awesome! Then the old timer sees his tattoo realizes who he is and locks the door 35 times behind him. That was a great part.The fight scenes were really well done. I like the mysteriousness of the main character. He was an auditor for those 3 letter agencies and he couldn't make arrests, as he put it. The fight scene on the bus was incredible. I love when he gets thrown off through the window and comes back on and all of their faces are like, are you kidding me?! Who is this guy the Terminator?!One of the reasons I like this movie is because you never really know about people's pasts. It's possible your neighbor is an ex-CIA Assassin or someone in witness protection. Another reason is they show that the main character, the father, and the brother actually enjoy killing. I like that they don't beat around the Bush that he's killing only out of necessity. He likes it. He goes out looking for a fight and enjoys every second of it. He couldn't handle his mundane life, he wanted to kill and hurt people. They missed it the rush and the hunt. They were smiling and loved killing the Russians.The last part and why I gave this movie a 9 instead of an 8 was social justice issues weren't slammed in my face. It wasn't PC at all. It wasn't a training movie from the left. It was an action thriller with great fight scenes and some witty dialogue. It didn't get bogged down with virtue signaling and 2021 hot button issues. It was just a fun movie and I commend the Director and Producers for not adding all that sludge. Definitely worth seeing it.P.s everyone comparing this to John Wick. John Wick was not the first action movie in the world. There have been hundreds of movies like this. I saw one commenter say it's like John Wick because he turns the lights off before he fights. What?!? You're in your home, somewhere you know every inch of, you turn the lights off for a massive tactical advantage on the intruders. It's been done thousands of times in movies because it's an advantage! John Wick was a great movie but other than the Underground Assassin world it created nothing else was new.

254,christophershobris,"Pure Fun, Wild Intensity",10,4 April 2021,"My interest in seeing this movie peaked when I saw who one of the producers were, and that being David Leitch (co-Director of ""John Wick""). Once I realized that, and the fact that Christopher Lloyd (""Back to the Future"") was in it, my excitement went through the roof. So obviously I had high expectations going in. I can safely say I throughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end. The film at first making you believe this guy really is a nobody, and then totally taking rug right from underneath you in a split second. The violence was really well handled, and somewhat satisfying, almost in a Quentin Tarantino kind of way. In fact, I believe this is a film Tarantino would be proud of. The film borrows a lot of the same elements and plot points from ""John Wick"" but gives it such a unique spin, it keeps it standing up on its own. A couple of the casting choices were amazing of who they got. Particularly Christopher Lloyd, and Michael Ironside (Total Recall) actors I've watched previously and respect as well. It was just a joy to see them in this. Bob Odenkirk proves he can carry an action film and deliver it to the promised land with a convincing performance as his character transitions from one behavior to another. And while I was excited to see Christopher Lloyd in this, I thought he was just going to play a grouchy old man eating his soup, and sleeping the rest of the film. I was entirely wrong, Lloyd has a lot more to do with what goes on then I anticipated, and it was a glorious sight to see. Michael Ironside didn't have much to do and only appears in a few scenes, but was still glad to see him as well. I can't remember the last time a film, let alone an action film made me grin from ear to ear as I was watching it, but this film certainly did it. And when a film can do that, it's got to be worth something. I only give 10/10s to films I love, or films that leave a positive impact on me, this is one of those. 10/10.",Nobody

Bob Odenkirk is a good actor but he can't do action, the fight scenes are a disgrace and the plot, such as it is has so many holes. For example a dozen heavily armed mercenaries invade a suburban home. There is gunfire and much broken furniture and people being beaten to death with kitchen equipment. Non of the neighbors call the police.

There's ""slightly"" more realism and the fact that the hero of this film seems vulnerable makes it more interesting; Bob Odenkirk does look like an everyday day guy in this film. But the action scenes and the fights are excellent and he does an excellent job nailing them! The film starts off well, somewhat slow and picks up faster pace within 20 min. Right at that point, there is one scene which is rather stupidly set-up to give way for the rest of the story...the one with the bus...but later things do improve. The bus sequence is excellent action, don't get me wrong. It's just the way it was setup prior to the action. But... don't look for any script/scene consistency...just enjoy.

Obviously known almost exclusively for comedy, seeming out of the blue does he take on an action star role and NAIL it. Clearly fit and well-trained for the part, at 58 years old Odenkirk brings it like any other action star half his age and effectively doubles his range - something that was probably always there from the start, but only now given the opportunity to flex.Obviously drawing major comparisons to John Wick (hint: same writer), the movie itself is a spiritual successor...short, consistent and the last half hour is non-stop action with a great payoff between characters that is worth the build-up. As someone else commented, it really plays on the formula on many of the great action flicks of the '90s and truly feels like it is from that classic era of just ""shut up and enjoy the ride"". The tight 90-ish minute length is a huge plus - there was no reason to draw this movie out any further than it had to be.So, again I'll ask Hollywood - after 30+ years in the industry do you just hate giving Odenkirk acting awards?

271,MovieWarfare,Bob Odenkirk does a phenomenal job,7,17 April 2021,"Nobody (2021) is directed by Ilya Naishuller, director of Hardcore Henry, and written by Derek Kolstad who also wrote the first 3 John Wick movies. David Leitch is also the producer of this and also directed the John Wick series. Seeing who worked on this gave me an expectation of fun and exciting action sequences similar to that of John Wick. The premise is ""Hutch Mansell fails to defend himself or his family when two thieves break into his suburban home one night. The aftermath of the incident soon strikes a match to his long-simmering rage. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must now save his wife and son from a dangerous adversary -- and ensure that he will never be underestimated again"". So does Nobody (2021) live up to my expectations or fail miserably?Firstly, Bob Odenkirk gives a great performance as the main character, Hutch Mansell. Bob Odenkirk doesn't look like an action star, no offence, so he perfectly fits the mundane and plain character of Hutch. He is perfect in really making it seem like this guy is really ""nobody"" special. However, when it is time for Hutch to become a super badass, Bob Odenkirk somehow manages to convince the audience that this bland and unimpressive guy is actually able to kick your ass. It feels completely natural and believable. He also does every stunt and it definitely shows. I also have to praise Christopher Lloyd as David Mansell, Hutch's father, as he is playing a role that you wouldn't expect from that actor.The action scenes are as exciting as you would expect. One thing about the action sequences that sets it apart from John Wick is that he isn't perfect and actually gets beaten up a lot. John Wick feels like a superhero and there is never really a feeling that he is actually in danger. In Nobody (2021) it honestly feels like Hutch is vulnerable and that his old age is making him weaker to his opponents to a certain extent. It gives a sense of danger and makes it feel like Hutch could potentially die which I appreciate. Additionally, the tone of this is a lot more comedic and this works well. I did get quite a fair bit of chuckle from certain scenes and it definitely gives a breather from all the murder.Nevertheless, Nobody (2021) feels way too much of a carbon copy of John Wick. There is an action scene where the bad guys invade the main characters home, there is the unfortunate mishap of the bad guys robbing the wrong persons home, there is the main lead coming out of retirement because they did something unforgivable, there is the people being scared of his reputation moment, there is him getting help from friends from old times, there is an evil Russian group that feels beat for beat from John Wick. It just feels kind of lazy and definitely doesn't do anything groundbreaking.The story and characters also lack a lot of polish. I don't end up caring about any of the characters because they don't spend enough time developing them including the main character. They sprinkle in some flashbacks or conversation about the main character that gives a sort of understanding why he is a badass but they don't explore any of the supporting characters. Nobody (2021) begins with him and his wife's relationship being trouble but why? Hutch has a half brother and his dad who appears but we don't get a complete understanding about their relationship either. Nobody (2021) needed 10 more minutes of runtime to explore this. The main Russian villain is just so generic as well that it is kind of disappointing.Overall, I wanted a fun action movie and that's exactly what I got. It didn't surprise me or anything and I feel like it was quite a forgettable movie by the end. However, I had a great time with its 90-minute runtime and I still would love a sequel. Heck I would even love for it to become a part of the John Wick universe and have Hutch meet John Wick. Bob Odenkirk is the biggest reason to give this a watch thanks to his amazing performance and stunt work.",Nobody

Guy seems to be a simple family man, tragedy occurs, man turns back into the old version of himself as an ass kicking special forces/mercenary killing machine, the old version he was trying to leave behind. But while on paper its very hackneyed, on the big screen it was an EXTREMELY well crafted action rollercoaster/gut busting dark comedy. What we got was a very well choreographed, all-guns-blazing ride and well written dark comedy that you will NOT soon forget.Like I said the action is nearly nonstop and its very well choreographed. It mirrors The Raid, John Wick, Die Hard. Sequences of brutal hand to hand combat that are the American versions of Hong Kong martial arts film. Brutal use of fists and blunt/sharp objects that make you wince and laugh. Not laughing because it is silly, but because its was so well shot and effective, you can't believe you just saw someone get destroyed like that. The gunplay is phenomenal as well. With several smaller engagements that are quick, fast paced, well choreographed and leave you groaning with amusement at the spectacle you are witnessing. In particular the final massacre of a firefight (the film's crescendo) at the end that will either leave you breathless of your lungs filled with air from scoffs of disbelief and saying ""holy s***"" every 10 seconds as you endure this ballroom dance of carnage.The writing too is pretty darn good. Its hard to tow the line between too much comedy in your action-comedy flick but this film does a good job. Just the right amount of jokes and silliness to complement the story as well as the action itself. The jokes are usually pretty quick and are little accents on to the situation of the action and it is generally speaking good and enhances the scene. Though some of the jokes are transitions and while like I said before, most of them worked well, a couple weren't so great and left me wondering why the editor decided to go that route. But generally speaking the editing as whole is very well done along with the choreography being shown.Round of applause for the actors well, nothing more needs to be said, every single one of them brought a unique character to the table, and while some of it is cheesy, the performances were great across the board.All in all I say if you like action movies, go see it, if you like the more hard versions that are gorier and more brutal, go see it, if you like action comedies, go see it.

Just a confusing way to look at this style of film...John Wick is okay because there's plenty of room in the revenge exploitation film genre, but has nothing to do with the Wick series nor is it ripping it off...it holds its own in a tongue and cheek fun film.Wick is more comic book production whereas this one leans on a tight script, good fight scenes, and being the antithesis of Odenkirk's usual character acting style, which makes the performance all that more of a winning formula.",Nobody

I hated it for all the same reasons most people hated it. There was no plot, it was cliche, and overall more of a video game than a movie. It was just a waste of time that put me to sleep actually, if not infuriate me as an insult to the audience's intelligence.That being said was the reason I actually didn't want to see this movie after finding out it was by the same people. However, I was proven wrong. This movie is by far superior and different than John Wick. Though the plot is still typical for an action film, nothing surprising and quite predictable, but it is how the story is told and unfolded through clever wit, humor, and unexpected attitude from the protagonist.What made it even more compelling is that while John Wick was more of a revenge film, this film has more of that Michael Douglas' Falling Down + Joaquin Phoenix's Joker's theme of a nice guy who was pushed and pushed until he snapped and taking out the society's trash (btw if you caught the metaphor from early on).Overall a seamingly flawless movie from beginning to the end that weaved the action, humor, satire, all together as a truly masterfully woven piece of art.

Bob Odenkirk from Better Call Saul excels in this adrenaline filled ride - Recommended,8,26 April 2021,"I've been looking forward to seeing this since I saw the trailer (several times) a few weeks ago, and although it doesn't live up to the film I was hoping for, it was still a fun watch.The key to enjoying this film is not to take it too seriously. It's, at times, supposed to be daft with tongue in cheek quips and action scenes. Reviews on here are likening it to the John Wick movies, a man with a past who has an incredible set of skills to deal with 'bad guys'.However, I wasn't a fan of the latest John Wick movie - read my review for it here - it took itself too seriously. Nobody (2021) doesn't do that though, the director, writers and producers all understood this was an over the top movie and treated it in a way which led to amusing moments and fun actions scenes. Bob Odenkirk is fantastic in the lead and, for me at least, carried the movie.In summary then:
Don't take the film seriously. It's supposed to be a mix of over the top action, daftness and humour.Bob Odenkirk is great in the lead role. Who would have thought Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad (2008) and Better Call Saul (2015) would be the main lead in a bad a$$ action movie!The film isn't a bore fest. Although one comment I read was ""this was the worst film i seen in years"" - is not only badly written but is utter nonsense.

You could argue the reason why John Wick went on a nonstop killing spree, but Odenkirks character in this movie? No. That was just dumb.Some robbers steal his daughters bracelet (which they didn't even steal), so he goes out to take it back. The robbers doesn't have it so he returns home on a bus and decides to pick a fight with a bunch of bullies. The guys was annoying and loud (slaps a book out of a guys hand and talks sleazy to a girl), but not deserving of being beaten half to death and to death. One of the bullies dies later on, which happens to be the brother of some boss in the russian mob(?), who send his army after him and his family.""Nobody"" caused this unnecessary chain of events. He put his, his friend, his father and his family's lifes at risk for absolutely no reason (and kind of complains about what's happening to him while burning down his house) - which makes the plot and the protagonists driving force and purpose kind of dumb.So even tho the action scenes was kind of okay, the stupidity of the plot is looming there in the background as a dumb wet blanket.",Nobody
289,blackoutH,Why always the Russians??,5,20 July 2021,"It seems that there has been a trend for this kind of sub-genre, I guess it gain popularity and more momentum with the John Wick trilogy, and there's no sign of stopping it.I am a fan of a good action flick but it seems these types of movies are the same, the only change are the characters. They contain, generic stereotypes - why are we still making Russian mobs as bad guys, this is so old if feels like a soap opera type of thing at this point, with hundreds of nationalities, still sticking with the same boring generic villains - over the top action and unnecessary violence, a badass protagonist that's usually someone you wouldn't think is a masterful fighter and that if you really get your mind into it, he is as much a psychopath as the people he hunts since a lot of the killing was completely avoidable - in fact for this one the whole plot was avoidable if the main character didn't went full psycho.Now is the part you ask why did you watch it then? Well for starters I wanted to see Bob Odenkirk in this completely radical change of acting choice, I am huge fan of Better Call Saul and was looking for to see how he did, and I can't lie he pulls it off.Also for whatever reason these movies keep getting good overall reviews so I guess I always hope to see something interesting, but not so much, it's boring, generic, the violence serves no purpose, it's not real (not in a John Wick way but in a way where his normal wife is okay with the shady and dangerous activity that can clearly caught up to them and their kids) and unless you also want to see Bob's range as an actor, give it a pass.",Nobody
290,Dottsylove,Mild mannered man you most likely shouldn't have messed with.,8,11 April 2021,"This is a man who reeeeallly missed what he did, in terms of his occupation and a film about revenge upon revenge. It's the same old story - you do someone wrong they gotta do you wrong and on and on. Well, this is one of those movies but done a little better than the rest.A family man has to deal with the ramifications of his inaction during a home invasion robbery. However he is ""of course "" not the man you wanna f with. The only thing that makes this a little better than the rest is how they at least tried not to make him out to be a superhero who manages to miss every weapon and fist used and thrown against him. No, he gets his a## kicked (and in a believable way) which is refreshing so to speak. However, he does gets his ""groove"" back later on.Story-line and action sequences kept me interested and there were a bunch of laughs which kept it refreshing . Odenkirk, really is the perfect choice for the mild mannered man you most likely shouldn't have messed with. And his original job title in the film was an absolute treat to find out ( I think it might not have been done before) yeah, it's just a ""title"" but after seeing sooo many films it's refreshing to see a newish plot-line. I really wanted to watch till the end with this movie, not cause of what the ending would be, but to see what interesting and horrible things he was going to do to the baddies. Christopher Lloys is Aaawwweewsome- and you'll see why.I'm really liking the soundtrack they chose. Definitively older popular songs that you should recognize. I'm writing this review as I'm watching the movie and I'm loving this movie the more I watch it. Okay, yeah, this movie just went from a 6.7 to a 7.2 Now it's about 7.8 - 8..

291,PaxD75,Hiring Saul to sue Bob for my time back,1,9 May 2021,"Starts off with what appears to be a very depressed family. Bob, his wife and even their teenage son. No explanation. Mood somber, the characters lifeless. They all just seem pretty depressed and worn down by life (or they simply don't like Bob much - hard to tell) except for the little girl (daughter). The little girl is happy with being a little girl.The girl's bracelet, however, gets stolen. Little girl stays happy but Bob goes psycho. I might have bought her a new one but hey... that's just me.Bob then gets on a bus angry because he didn't find his daughter's plastic, 10 cent bracelet. At this point, the audience must be feeling drowsy so the director decides to randomly crash a car to wake us up - BOOM! It also serves as an excuse for the 5 riders inside the car to enter a bus and behave thug-like.Before these 5 guys actually do anything that warrants the term thug - except for surrounding a young woman on the bus and calling her pretty - Bob proceeds to give them a beat down. The fight scene was as good as the plot so far - which is to say not very. It felt like a bunch of actors pretending to fight, while also pretending to act.30 minutes in.

300,severindringel,"A fun action movie, how it should be made",7,10 July 2021,"Saul Goodman as a vengeful thug? The Saul Goodman who got beat up by lanky Jesse in Breaking Bad? Yes, that's exactly the case. Bob Odenkirk changes his lawyer suit for a breezy jogging outfit. The scars don't come from angry criminal clients, but bloodthirsty scoundrels he goes toe-to-toe with. After the family man gets soft during a break-in at his house, he wants to prove it to himself and his loved ones and becomes the object of desire of a cold-blooded mob boss.Bob Odenkirk proves once again in the leading role that he is capable of pretty much anything as an actor. Initial sitcom appearances were followed by the cynical-dramatic role of one of TV's most iconic characters Saul Goodman and now his first foray into the world of full-blooded action. First he has to grow into this physical performance as Hutch Mansell. At the beginning he is frustrated, almost run down like a wet sack. He is visibly in a crisis of purpose, also called a mid-life crisis at his age. His wife doesn't really know what to do with him anymore and for his son he is a failure. Only his little daughter is a kind of anchor for him, for her he is the best. Nevertheless, Hutch's life is anything but satisfactory. Until he takes heart and begins to fight with undisciplined people. Odenkirk radiates this menace, almost danger, with a self-image that one almost buys as a real person. In the course of the film he becomes more and more disillusioned and indifferent, which makes the character so much more fun. No spasm, no overcoming - just a natural-looking transformation. Of course, this lacks any realism, not to mention character development, but Odenkirk does what he was tasked with brilliantly. The supporting cast around Connie Nielsen, who plays his wife Becca, also do their job well. Nielsen doesn't break any new ground in the originality of her character, but she knows how to convince with a nuanced and even slightly unpredictable performance towards the end. Seeing Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) in several scenes as a senile nursing home resident is absolutely absurd and enriching. Even if his character makes no sense, as Odenkirk's father he makes for badass scenes and even a family feel-good moment or two.If you're looking for deep films with a plot that adds educational value, you should definitely NOT watch Nobody. It is simply an old school action film that definitely provides thriller elements in its structure. Even if you can imagine what will happen next in the scenes. It doesn't add anything that didn't exist before - and that's perfectly ok. It's best to watch Nobody after a hard day's work anyway. You get what you expect from such a film in 1 ½ hours and leave the cinema in a good mood. The creators of John Wick should put their prioritised project aside and concentrate more on sequels for Bob Odenkirk's new action franchise - this one is much more promising and entertaining!",Nobody

313,cristinalinderman,A John Wick humor style film.,6,18 April 2021,"* There is 1 mid-credit scene *The director Ilya Naishuller and crew brought a John Wick humor style film. The story is about a man with a dark past and it catches up to him when his actions are noticed by a vengeful drug lord. The movie was an enjoyable film, but it wasn't as great as I expected it to be. I was kind of annoyed throughout the film due to having too many elements from the film John Wick (2014), and I wouldn't care if it would at least made this story serious. The lack of it was making this film a little bit unbearable to watch because if this kind of story was darker it would have been one of the best action films from this year well in my point of view. Also, it was a little tiring and cliché when in action films the father of the main character is a well-known famous actor, it is used too many times for me to be impressed by it. The build-up was too weak for my taste and it needed more dark suspense though the action was very entertaining.The composer David Buckley's music was barely making a stand in the film. The music of the composer was fantastic but they focus so much on the choices of songs which was one of the things that made the film too light and comedic. I was annoyed because there were scenes I would have appreciated more the action but the songs made it too goofy and it was taking the suspense of the scenes.The main actor Bob Odenkirk was amazing, I like how calm he approaches everything. The way he was building up his character was great to watch. His performance kept me interested throughout the story and this film was entertaining due to his performance, not the script. It such a shame if only his backstory could have been build up in a more intimidating way it could have impacted more my curiosity about his past without giving too much. The other cast was just a blur I barely noticed their performances with the lack of intensity of the script.",Nobody

John plays the straight man while Bob is actually quite quirky and reminiscent of Mel Gibson's Porter in Payback.But while the films differ in character motivations, they both take a very simple formula and run with it effectively.I expected a reasonably fun couple of hours with my brain switched to neutral.

What follows is an excellent example of how to do this kind of slapstick with impact.The camerawork and stuntwork are above average throughout and occassionally brilliant. All the scenes are inventive and the pacing is almost perfect. The soundtrack is a little intrusive for my taste, but apart from that, I had a great time.

356,dannyrovira-38154,ANDRENALINE-PUMPING THRILL RIDE!,8,29 August 2021,"IIya Naishuller's witty, clever, blood-soaked action thriller which is truly impressive and engaging. It concerns a mild-manned suburban working class father named Hutch Mansell, sensationally played by Bob Odenkirk, who lives a very mundane existence with his wife and children, superbly played by Connie Nielsen, Gage Munroe, and Paisley Cadorath, until one night when a pair of thieves break into his home and change all that, Hutch decides not to defend himself or attack the thieves, which disappoints his son and shames him in front of his wife, but it also awakens a long-dormant rage and a set of super-lethal skills from his secret past. One evening soon after the incident in his home Hutch will have to stand up against a group of young cutthroats on a city bus, where he beats the hell out of all of them, making their murderous Russia crimelord boss Yulian Kuznetsov, terrifically played by Aeksey Serebryakov, seek vengeance on him and his beloved family. Solid direction by Naishuller, who givies film a series of jaw-dropping action sequnces and gun battles, fine supporting performances by Michael Ironsides, RZA, Colin Salmon, Billy MacLellan, and Araya Mengesha. Special Kudos to the scene-stealing Christopher Lloyd for his brilliantly amusing turn as Hutch's elderly father David Mansell.

Sure, it suffers from a few of the typical tropes like the the stormtrooper-esque accuracy and lemming-like intelligence of the goons who enter the camera shot just to get blown away moments later by the main protagonist, but cannon fodder aside, this was a solid movie.Without spoilers, I'll say that I enjoyed the first fight sequence (bus) the most, the reason being that you don't see an invincible secret agent type just whaling away on hapless thugs. Instead, Hutch gets his share of a beat down and gets quite injured, but keeps getting back up. It gives a feeling that the character's strength comes not from flawless fighting technique, but rather from an unquenchable tenacity to achieve what he sets out to do.Can't complain about the side characters either. The main boss Yulian makes a hilarious entrance and stays entertaining throughout. Hutch's father and brother are both pretty badass in their own right, although it would have been nice to see a bit more of RZA on screen aside from the ending.Ending felt a bit rushed, but then again I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane here.

That's because we're rooting for Jimmy McGill, and not for *looks up the name* Hutch Mansell. Who?Had it been anyone other than Bob Odenkirk in the lead at this moment in time, this movie likely would have gotten worse ratings, and probably rightfully so. Odenkirk plays the lead perfectly however, apart from just being there, and I really hope to see more of this. And alright, more Hutch Mansell.Some of the action scenes are great, spectacular and sometimes even genius. I loved most of the music. The opening scene is amazing and beautiful.Unfortunately, the level of quality isn't equal throughout the movie. While we're of course not really watching this for the story, the story is what holds this movie down in my opinion. It's a bit lazy with certain plot advancements, not always serious enough when it needs to be more serious and not always silly enough when it needs to be more silly. If you want to mix serious with silly, you need to do it right; hit the right notes at the right time. This wasn't entirely right and there are a few false notes as well.But, in the end this is a ""turn off your brain and enjoy the ride"" kind of movie, and if you can do just that, it'll be entertaining. 7,5/10, rounding down to a 7.",Nobody
377,thatfilmperson,A way above average action.,8,5 May 2021,"If you liked:
Transporter
The Dark Knight
John WickI haven't watched these kinds of action movies in forever, because I usually just can't sit through the terrible writing they awkwardly put on top of the brutal fighting scenes and car chases. They never seem to pay attention to the script or acting, because people will watch it for the action anyway. Well, not this time.Hutch is an office clerk, living a dull, boring Groundhog Day - life. Nothing exciting ever happens with him, people at work make fun of him, and his wife secretly resents him. One day two people break into his home, and although he has an opportunity to do something about it, he decides not to... After this incident, something changes in Hutch. Judging by the ""if you liked"" movies, you probably already figured out that there will be a lot of fighting and combat involved. The fight scenes are just brilliantly filmed, that long bus scene alone is outstanding. I've also never seen that in these films they go for some kind of realism, where the main character, despite brutally beating everybody, isn't an indestructible robot (like Marvel superheroes) and actually gets hit in the face quite a lot. Towards the end of the film, they dispense with the realism and just make everything ""cool"", but at that point it wasn't a problem - the film looked amazing anyway. I thought that a lot of the scenes were inspired by ""The Dark Knight"", that's why I also added that film to the ""similar movies list"", but don't expect some big similarities, it's more of a tribute to particular scenes. A way above average action that I can actually recommend.It was filmed by a Russian newbie-director Ilya Naishuller, who started by directing music videos for The Weeknd and a Russian band called ""Leningrad"". In 2015 he made a movie called ""Hardcore Henry"", which was noticed by Quentin Tarantino and right before filming ""Nobody"" Tarantino sent him a signed copy of a script for ""Pulp Fiction"", wishing him luck in the world of cinema; because he knew that Naishuller is a huge fan and already owned a copy of that script.

The movie is enjoyable, I'll give it a 7 out of 10 because this kind of movies/plot hardly ever fails, but the director should have worked more on the plot to stand out from the crowd, it is cliché and predictable, this movie isn't gonna be a classic but another one on the pile.",Nobody

Right from the beginning, just right from the first scenes presented in the movie, to be more precisely, you simply just feel that this is going to be a masterpiece and it will immediately hook up your interest.The movie is what a realistic action movie should really be. There are no those types of fights where the protagonist is fighting a bunch of other guys, it beat them, but he doesn't even has a scratch. No, not at all. The movie is ultra realistic and the production took it's time to pay very close attention the details, because most of the time, those are what makes the difference. In a movie like this, even if it's based on a lot of fighting and action, the details are very important too.The plot of the movie it's not very complex (I don't even really see why it should be), but it's long enough and easy to understand, in order to offer you some background on the story and I think that what I've seen in the movie, from this point of view, is just enough.The last aspect I've been very amazed by it, it's the soundtrack, not to mention, again, the attention to details regarding the songs. For me, the soundtrack, be it a movie, or a TV show, it's very important and sometimes, even more important than the story itself. Every moment has it's own piece of music, which has been carefully chosen, in order to make you get more immersed in the atmosphere. Great soundtrack.Overall, the movie is a must-watch, especially if you are a fan of action movies, like John Wick (which is very similar to this one). The movie is a real deal and there are really slim chances for you to get bored while watching it. Congratulations to the production team, for bringing us such a masterpiece of a movie.

The author of this movie is a hack ripping off a grind house/king fu with guns classic in john wick. But wait he also wrote john wick ? Oh well the writer ripped himself off. So it's not original another grindhouse king fu flick with guns instead of kicks. So what makes it good and not just a pure ripoff. The story is a little different, I guess.

The action was hard-hitting and awesome, the story was incredibly generic, and it had enough goofy moments to balance everything. The only thing I knew about this film was that it was from some of the makers of John Wick, and I've got to say: it is refreshing to see an action hero who also takes a beating himself, whereas John Wick can walk off multiple shotgun wounds. Plus, I think casting Bob Odenkirk as the main characters was a fantastic choice, I can't wait to see what he does next.",Nobody
396,jessup-86446,A dark comedy exploring the familiar territory of an ordinary man pushed too far? Nope. Just another John Wick style bullet storm.,6,26 July 2021,"Let's be real, Bob Odenkirk is not the name that pops to mind when someone talks about action heroes, so you can understand where I'm coming from here in expecting something distinctly different from what I got.I was led to believe this was about an average suburban Joe who 'might' have been somebody once upon a time, but wasn't anymore, being pushed to the brink by his own ennui and mounting frustrations against the daily grind and then lashing out in a spectacularly hilarious and self-destructive fashion.That's what the first 30 minutes built up to, and that's the movie that I was really enjoying watching.Then 'scary' Russian mobsters started pulling out machine guns and people started talking about the pentagon and things just got more and more fantastically NOT average Joe!So instead of a unique dark comedy, we end up with an almost scene for scene reenactment of the plot of The Equalizer, minus Denzel's tortured angst and with RZA and Christopher Lloyd thrown in just for kicks.6/10 Stars. A fun, if overly familiar, action romp, with a few decent beats of comedy, but nothing like what it could have been if they'd stayed the course and left the demolitions guys out of it.",Nobody

398,JoelAlexanderr,The dumb and bloody action movie that 2021 needed,8,9 May 2021,"Finally got around to watching NOBODY, and it's as badass as one could expect. Bob Odenkirk nails it as a dad going through an existential crisis who decides to revive his mysterious past in order to feel more alive again, making me want to see far more action movies with him as the star. This film is like if you took John Wick and mixed it with Home Alone and American Beauty, and it never disappoints from an action perspective. The same people who made John Wick helped out with NOBODY, and the resemblance is clear, with the authentic and gritty hand-to-hand combat and long takes of brutal carnage.The movie does get a little too cheesy near the end and almost has too many scenes of campy dialogue in the last act, but criticizing this movie is honestly pointless because every ""negative"" decision is done with a great amount of self-awareness and irony. NOBODY is skull-crushing fun. No more thought is needed than that. B+",Nobody

404,WillsFilms,Nobody Kicks Ass,8,12 June 2021,"Nobody is a solid action movie with brilliantly choreographed fight sequences, backed up the movie's phenomenal editing, delivering an enjoyably stylised take on the violence. As for the acting, Bob Odenkirk delivers a steller performance, delivering depth to his morally grey lead. Christoper Lloyd also provides an extremely entertaining supporting performance, as does Aleksei Serbryakov as the charismatic, yet frightening villain. The film also has a very good plot, with a slow, yet satisfying reveal of the true identity of the titular nobody. There is also quite a bit of injected humour, which was amusing and didn't detract from serious moments. The soundtrack is also wonderful, with perfect song choices, which complement the plot of the movie perfectly. If there was one major issue, it would be that RZA's character felt unnecessary and just there to capitalise on his star power. However, Nobody is an excellent action thrill ride, which I highly recommend.",Nobody

409,willcrabbe,Fun and violent popcorn flick,6,15 June 2021,"Ilya Naishuller's follow-up to Hardcore Henry is a shameless clone of John Wick starring a world-weary Bob Odenkirk as Hutch Mansell, a seemingly average family man living a dull life as a tools salesman repeating the same routine day after day, week after week (displayed in an excellently edited opening scene). However, after thieves break into his house one night and steal his daughter's bracelet, something snaps inside him and Hutch reveals that there may be more darkness to his past than his quiet demeanour lets on.If you're looking for a violent and mindlessly fun action flick you're going to have a blast with this one. The action sequences were slick and surprisingly brutal with the editing and sound design well executed to amplify the style and savagery. Every punch and impact hit like a sledgehammer and had me wincing on multiple occasions.I thought Odenkirk was great and filled the role with aplomb. He made the transition from 'that guy' from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, to an action star that provides more than just physicality almost seamlessly. It was also nice to see Christopher Lloyd and Michael Ironside in supporting roles, but they were unfortunately underutilised.I did feel a bit of Baby Driver syndrome with this one, being that there wasn't really much to the film beyond the stylistic aspects. It certainly lulled at times despite its noticeably short runtime and this prevented me from being as invested as I could have been.Overall, Nobody is a fun popcorn flick with wonderfully crafted action, but it lacks the brains and charm that could have made it a great.",Nobody

""Nobody"" is no masterpiece. It's not original. It is quite entertaining, but all in all, you feel like you're treading familiar territory, and if you are over 12 years old, you probably are. Nevertheless, while I don't care for violence or bodycounts, the premise (similar to ""A History of Violence"" - with the magnificent and also somewhat scarier Viggo Mortensen - but funnier) is engaging. Only that in this iteration they have a secret weapon that makes the whole experience kind of unique and fresh: Bob Odenkirk, who totally and masterfully sells his deadpan and middle-age-crisis-family-man persona. He is the only reason why this movie distinguishes itself from the horde of action films with similar plots that plagued the theaters in the last years, and the saving grace that made me see past the meaningless violence and kept my interest till the very end.

It starts off slow and kind of all over the place. If you have ADHD or ADD you'll know what I'm talking about.

I'm typically open towards any film, and always willing to watch once at the very least. Nobody seemed to have a clear idea of what it wanted to be, and what it set out to be itself. I can't say that I was impressed, but I can say I loved Bob Odenkirk and I loved the idea of this film. What I didn't care for was the generic villain, the poor storytelling of who Bob Odenkirk's character was, and the lackluster action (aside from a few scenes) that occurred during the duration of its runtime. I can quite simply put it as this: Dollar General John Wick. It was a funny movie, it had cool moments, and it felt like it was something more than what it premised itself as. Yet, by the end of the film, I had this bad taste in my mouth like I watched a generic action film with no substance other than questions left behind. I have now convinced myself that this is a subsidiary of the John Wick universe (as this is the only way I can tell myself this is a badass film) and that Nobody is connected to that universe. Regardless, it's a semi-decent watch, I was quite disappointed and underwhelmed by the film and felt upset that this is what came to be in fruition rather than what it could've been.",Nobody

The action had moments, but overall was standard fare. Like I said there wasn't much in the way of comedy, which is surprising with Bob O. As the lead. Its like the film makers wanted the movie to be considered a legit action movie and were scared of adding too much humor or else they wouldn't be considered a ""real"" action movie.

Maybe in the first half there's not enough action, but the ending fully makes up for that. The story itself is enjoyable enough, but not the main reason to watch. You can't help but to make the comparison to John Wick and that movie has a little of an edge story wise (probably because they did it first), but it didn't really affect my enjoyment. It does add some new elements to the genre, but it's mostly stuff we've seen before. The execution is what makes the movie such a great watch. The way they introduce characters and plot points, the comedic timing and especially the performances. Bob Odenkirk gives an amazing performance that we can both relate to and laugh with at times.

The action choreography is great and the build up to each sequence is perfect.

Story is just awful, really generic, youve seen it all before 100 times over. The only redeeming parts are the beginning 20/30 minutes. Like I love John wick but this just didn't do it for me.Definitely okay to watch to pass the time with some mates but don't expect much.Feel like if they didn't make this so action based and added a few odenkirky quirks and added some style choices in it could have been fantastic..Was cool to see Christopher Lloyd though.",Nobody

The bus scene, and the home invasion scene in a lesser way, was intense as hell and it was way more realistic and inventive than an average action movie scene. I felt the vulnerability of the main character to my bones and he really put his everything against his opponents by pushing his limits. The fights were raw as duck meat and gunless but not gutless.Then, the ordinary action scenes came. At this point, the film has became yet another typical action film which overkill becomes more important than tension and characters. Instead of finishing it with standard Hollywood cliches such as being untouchable by bullets or killing armed people easier than mosquitos in a hot summer day, the movie should have followed the path of first half. There is a huge audience out there that prefer more intelligent yet still engaging action flicks. I hope that mistake will not be repeated in the sequel.",Nobody

There's no way they would make a movie in 2020 that's utterly devoid of thought whatsoever?"" No, sorry. It's THAT dumb. Just pointless illogical punching and shooting from start to finish. Our hero, who is curiously bored throughout the whole movie, is a superman and everyone else is a subhuman imbecile who lived, slept, ate and worked out for 30 years just so they'd have the pleasure of dying at the hands of a bored American. You'd think he'd get at least a little injured, but no, he finishes the movie as healthy as an ox, ready for more. It's a feast for an empty head. Since it's recently become a bit politically sensitive to shoot Black people for no reason in America, and since Asians and Latinos are also major customers of the movie industry, and since we all know that white Western Europeans are very rarely criminals, they'd have to settle for that one remaining ethnic group who everyone is still free to openly victimize, the Russians.",Nobody

476,lobstersurreal,Fails to live up to the hype. No depth or layers.,6,18 April 2021,"Look it's a good film. The plot is simple. John Wick meets Equalizer. However, the rave reviews and the hype are nowhere warranted and accurate. People are acting it is Joker 2019 - the ONLY movie where the hype fully lived up to potential as well as Heath Ledger's Joker.Given the spate of utter garbage that Hollywood spews out this obviously transcends the mediocrity. However, just like at the end of Equalizer 1 and 2's warehouse and deserted city scene in thunderstorm, I just couldn't wait for it to end at the end which seemed to drag on and on. Because you KNOW what's gonna happen. The obvious Hollywood predictable trope. Although I loved Equalizer 1 and 2 and John Wick 1, I couldn't stand Parabellum and to this date haven't finished it even though paying 10 bucks online. As some famous critic pointed out for Parabellum it is almost someone unlocked the cheat code of Immortality.Same thing with the ending of this movie. It's almost nothing can go wrong and thus no tension nor suspense. Had it not been for sunken cost fallacy, I would have easily given it 8,9,10. But I won't even though I spent 20$ online.As far as the movie itself, love the acting and slightly raspy voice of the actor. I mean yeah judging by his acting alone it is hands down 10/10 performance.But other than that there is no depth, no layers, no nuance. At least in Equalizers you see the layers and subplots and exploration of anciliary character's arc. I mean Equalizer 2's gun to the head scene (it only takes x amount of pressure to kill) is one of the most powerful scenes in cinema thanks to Denzel's performance and writing.Unlike Equalizer there are no cool monologues. Dialogues are bland. Nothing is left for the cherry on the top in the final scene. I honestly couldn't wait for the gratutitious action scenes to be over. Unlike the character arc of Equalizer, Christopher Lloyd's prescence was just filler as well as the other African-American dude who came to his help.I mean.... luring the bad guys to a warehouse/abandoned city/big office building with booby traps is as tired as ever.Finally, movie makers REALLY need to stop making action scenes at night or dark where you can't see 90% of what's taking place. One horrible example of this dark tinted scene was in non-action film Fatima. But again and again filmmakers do it for action scenes which might as well be staring at a black wallpaper. For God's sakes, stop.Watch if for fun, entertainment and thrill. But don't believe the hype.",Nobody
477,kranthireddyg,BETTER CALL 911!!!!!,8,8 June 2021,Oh my God odenkirk is relentless.This movie came out of nowhere and is full of surprises.I understand why everyone compares it with John Wick.Russian mob boss and his spoiled son messes with someone they shouldn't and burning money of gangsters and a pet element and final showdown.Maybe they have their similarities but this movie is much more and it doesn't have any powerful characters like wick movies which makes it even more appealing and surprisingly good.Odenkirk was at his phenomenal best I didn't knew he had it in him.Selebryakov was breathtaking and it's the atmosphere he builds up keeps our adrenaline high throughout the movie.And the authenticity of action sequences which every action lover checks is spine chilling and Naishuller left no box unturned.But at the end it gives a feel of regular yet beautiful flick.Finally a worthy and fancy addition to Hollywood which keeps going on for a while.Credit to odenkirk who's phenomenally funny yet intense and dangerous.,Nobody

I personally liked the Russian club scene and the Russian songs played there serye glaza what a beautiful voice. Im not from Russia but it sure beats billboard top 100.The cinematography and action scenes at middle was quite okay the end battle was a little too cliche and funny because there was people with guns coming for an old guy and he didn't have a scratch was just hilarious.

However from the clips I stumbled across as well as the brief plot descriptions I was expecting something similar to kevin bacon's movie Death Sentence. I was expecting a revengre movie where an ordinary person went to extraordinary lengths to get revenge/justice when they were wronged and/or their family were hurt and the law failed them.Unforunately this is not a gritty action movie, this is very hollywood, the action sequences are very over the top, very silly and very cartoonish. That's not bad necessarily and I did enjoy watching it, but the main character being from a family of untouchable super humans who are like a cross between john wick and jason bourne, able to handle whatever is thrown at him without ever even breaking a sweat, rather than an everyman fighting both physically and morally to make it through, it takes away from the experience in my opinion, it's all too easy, theres no risk, no danger, no repercussions, no effort, it is simply an invincible super human having fun.",Nobody

Had a family feel about the film, but not really for under 16s. So, a house invader reels when hit with a plate, and our hero can pick up the phone without wincing when shot in the shoulder, but it's just that type of film.Felt fantastic after watching it. A great idea behind the film and I loved that the first half of the film wasn't really action. Some interesting film work, though I must admit the ending was a bit formulaic and combat orientated.I advise this film for everyone over 15, men and women, because it's fun.

To me anyway! There's enough humour - sometimes portrayed to perfection with just with a wry sideways glance -, and how could there not be with Christopher Lloyd and Bob Odendirk? It doesn't profess to be a visual form of great literature, a complex saga, a deeply thoughtful piece or an epic story. It is exactly what it sets out to be; an amusing, over-the-top violent tale of an unreformed (despite his best efforts to the contrary) hard man dealing to a bunch of bad guys. I chuckled all the way through, and sometimes just from the recognition that this is what a lot of men (I can't speak for women) wish they could do to those low-life, bullying, scum-of-the-earth types that inevitably cross paths with us at some point in our lives.

He's supposedly a finely-calibrated death instrument, but takes a dangerous fight on a bus against multiple people, disarming his revolver first and going in bare-handed, against multiple opponents half his age, and armed with knives (and gets stabbed in the process!). Something a seasoned assassin would never do.He visits burglars that robbed his house, shoots a guy, but then breaks down and goes into panic at the sound of a baby. I'm no master assassin, but that's definitely not how one should or would act. Especially being a legendary grim reaper as the rest of the movie tries to paint him.His entire demeanor comes off as one of a psychopath, not a professional, and highly doubtful that any actual agency would hire someone like him.It's even more sickening how his estranged-for-decades wife suddenly falls in love with him again... over a living room full of brain bits, blood pools and broken bones. It's not just weird, it's terrifyingly stupid and tasteless.Final act takes place in a some sort of mechanics shop, complete with pre-built trap spikes and wall-mounted explosive charges. At this point, my brain just started screaming for help. Unless this movie was a horror film about extreme dangers PTSD and mental health, I really didn't get the message.So, as nerd power fantasies go, this is pretty silly, distasteful and gruesome. Feels like it's written by a bullied 12-year old. Which it probably is. Better avoid.",Nobody

It copes with the task well, which is especially apparent on a big screen where the entire performance seems extremely convincing and immersive. All the dynamic scenes of fights, violence and dizzy stunts accompanied with witty cynical jokes - at times even too bold for western public - serve this purpose.Quite predictably, such movies are not intended for people loving deep ideas and the prolonged feeling of contemplative aftertaste. On the other hand, neither is it a downright hollow work: it has its own taste and style, and it's by no means a dumb action movie with stone-faced characters and tedious primitive dialogs. In addition, although the main villain comes across as a fairly caricature person - a maniacal Russian mafiosi even though with his own interesting hobbies - the protagonist is a lively and controversial individual: he makes compromises, and they are not always ethical.To cut it short, the movie is definitely a great pick to give a rest to one's mind as well as have some laughs. It's highly recommended for those admiring stylish actions by Guy Ritchie. What's more, behind all these decalitres of blood and violence it's still possible to recognise quite a certain thought brought out to the stage: whether one can really flee from their real selves and become someone else, and even if it's feasible then for how long and whether it's worthwhile at all.",Nobody

Well, I just wish I could suddenly snap out of my poverty and transformed into a very rich guy overnight. This overly dramatized modern day miraculous transformation is just too difficult to believe.

Starting with the motivation of the protagonist and ending with the end of the film, where three people(actually 2 and an old man) overthrow a whole platoon of Russian mobsters! And the motivation of the main protagonist is that he has to return the doll bracelet to his little daughter, which according to him was stolen by the thieves at the beginning of the film! Well, yes, and in John Wick, the main protagonist's motivation is to punish the perpetrators who shot his dog. But in Nobody, the motivation is already grotesquely funny.I must admit that the battle on the bus was very good and more or less realistic. But at the end of the film, it turns out that the protagonist has simply lost shape in the battle on the bus and by the end of the film will regain his divine powers. Haha!Apart from this scene, there is nothing memorable in the film. The whole middle section is a cliche and it's like being copied from a Cold War 80's spy movie, where the Americans are the good and the Russians are the bad!Already at the end of the film it can be seen that only one old man and two middle-aged people trained for ""Rambo level"" can overthrow a whole platoon of Russian mobsters! As in reality, the Russian mafia is made up mostly of ex-military, ex-FSB's, ex-berets, ex-spies and etc.That's why I rate this movie with 3, because even the fight scenes didn't show anything unseen and special that we haven't seen in John Wick!

Meaning, it tries hard to not be John Wick but can't be helped that you must compare it to that high bar of mindless action.The biggest fault in this movie, is the inciting incident. And I'm pretty sure, unlike John Wick, Odenkirk's character was 100% in the wrong here. And I think that's what bothered me with this movie.The opening features a home invasion at Odenkirk's house. He does nothing to stop it. Then the daughter says she lost her favorite bracelet, this causes Hutch (had to look up his name) to need to bust an old violent-nut, since he got blueballs from not acting prior. So he goes on a manhunt, tracks down these two amateur robbers and doesn't act again, since they have a baby on oxygen. Blueballed again, sulks back home via public transport when a car full of drunkards crashes into a blockade, then decide to bring their drunk rowdy selves onto the bus. Start Harassing a woman on the bus, nothing too bad, and that's when Hutch finally gets to nut. And that's where I take issue. He instigates everything. Ends up that one of the guys he attacked has a crazy hitman's brother in the Russian mob. Since it's always Russians in these movies, since apparently we're stuck in the 80s.And then the movie picks up. The instigating fight scene was nice, Hutch gets properly messed up during the fight, and that's nice. I always liked that about this creator's movies, not pretty fights, and the heroes (debatable in this one if Hutch is one) aren't invincible.Conclusion:John Wick Light, not bad, good and to-be-expected action. Christopher Lloyd still being awesome at 83, it's just John Wick set the bar too high for this creator. I guess the best word to describe it is ""Cute"". And that's just as condescending as it is appropriate. It's a quaint movie, with all the right amount of action and acting. Nothing excels, but at the same time, NOTHING falls flat either.

In a typical
protagonist story arc, the hero usually faces a low point right before the big show down. There's a looming cloud of dispare and tension right before it all comes to a head in the final act. It's standard plot structure. But, in this movie, that doesn't happen. The final show down happens out of the blue without any real in-depth character journey.The movie is essentially just a series of really cool sequences lined up together. Most of the time, these lined up sequences form a cohesive story, sometimes they do not.I leave a high rating because these sequences, by themselves, are really cool and fun to watch.

It's not very complicated, and perhaps most ideas in the movies have been done before. But lots and lots of scenes had me genuinely smiling. It was an absolute blast to watch. And hats of to Christopher Lloyd, He's first scene, actually doing something, was nothing short of glorious.There's no hiding that this movie borrows from John Wick, Jack Reacher, perhaps even Home Alone if that movie had been R rated.But damn are there lot's to enjoy in Nobody. Acting all around was good, Action was awesome, story was pleasantly coherent, and kept me interested all the way to the end.Like most action movies, the action scenes at the end, escalated a little too far, in my opinion, but I'm not gonna say that's bad, as I suspect most people preferer that, instead of more grounded ""realistic action""So for what the movie tried to be, I'd say it nailed it.",Nobody

650,TruthTeller98765,Just what we need at this point in time - an actual movie without an agenda,10,13 May 2021,"It is absolutely accurate to sum up Nobody as ""John Wick meets Bob Odenkirk."" Nobody is, after all, made by the same people who made the John Wick films. If you do not like John Wick, you will probably not care for Nobody either. Yet, Odenkirk's personality and performance transforms Nobody into something a bit different than just a straight John Wick knock-off. I mean, it's freaking Bob Odenkirk after all. Watching Odenkirk beat up on people is a very different feeling than if this movie had cast some well-trod action star like Keanu Reeves or Jason Statham. There is a great supporting cast as well, even though they do not appear on screen for as much time as I would have liked. If you are a fan of action films, you will love Nobody. It is violent, very violent in fact (probably more-so than even the John Wick films), so be prepared for that.What makes Nobody special, though, is what it is not. There is no overarching, in-your-face political message here. There is no ""deconstructing"" of the standard action tropes in a way that portrays action films as an inherent negative plight on society. Nobody is just ... a movie. A regular movie, which feels revolutionary in and of itself at this particular time in 2021 when seemingly every movie and television show is loaded from the moment it begins with divisive political, gender, or racial (usually all three) themes that intentionally pit groups against each other as defined in clear ""good"" and ""bad"" terms by the show/movie at issue. Media used to be about escapism from the problems of real life and now it is about shoving every real-life problem in your face constantly when you just want to relax at night with a bag of Cheetos in your hand. Even during previous eras of political rancor, like the 1960's/1970's, you would not have expected to see the political movements of that era (Black Panthers, National Organization for Women, etc.) reflected in something like the Brady Bunch or other popular movies and sitcoms of the day. People understood that TV/Movies were about escaping from those problems around unified themes that brought us together.To that extent, Nobody is just exceptional. After watching what Disney/Marvel did to Captain America in ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,"" we need something like Nobody to escape from the divisive madness, and that is what Nobody most certainly does for its roughly hour and a half timeframe.

Something that the CoD and CS gamers would watch for all long hour and thirty minutes until the next Wick comes.So, get the screenwriter of John Wick, the young-ish Russian director of Hardcore Henry, who just loves action, and a B-list star who enjoys a healthy fan following, give them 15 mil and hope for the best. The story is utter nonsense, but that is to be expected. The cast is often questionable, there is some pretty bad cardboard acting, and Bob Odenkirk himself is never really that believable as an older version of John Wick, although he tries to make the best of it.But you don't watch this type of movies for plot / psychological insights. You watch it for pure shoot-em-up action. And the action disappoints: it is mostly banal, with deus ex machina moments used every time the screenwriter writes himself into a corner. There are maybe 3-4 original scenes that may put a smile on your face, but no more than that.It's a movie aimed at 10-14 year olds, who might find it light-hearted, violent fun (although they cannot even legally watch it, as the movie got an R rating, which is really too harsh), adults should stay away and wait for the COVID to end and the Hollywood getting back into business or, I don't know, maybe rewatch Tenet.",Nobody

People complained that Hardcore Henry was hard to watch and has no story but then they like this garbage which is harder to watch because of the awful editing and has literally zero story.

719,truthbrarian,Good movie but just a rant,8,30 May 2021,"Nobody is a movie where, a lone family man, fights the odds where he kills over 100 Russians almost non stop. All the Russians in the movie are bad and there is no counterbalance good Russian character to root for its all bad.Have you ever considered why Russians are so attacked at all times in media? Why are they always made out to be disposable trash? How it seemed like people only really started attacking President Trump when he said ""I would work with Russia and make them into allies"" and then it was Russian allegations leading to one sided impeachments?In movies like these the main WASP American good boy kills thousands of Russian Mafia as we cheer. You saw that in John Wick, and in Wrath of Man. Probably more. When are Russians even NICE you know? Why can't they even be helpful, friendly people and a sidekick or a good guy who helps his community in a movie? Could it be Democrats writing all these movies? Obviously. Watch the Youtube channel Bald and Bankrupt and you'll see so many nice Russians in reality.What really gets me is, we used to be their mortal enemies in the Cold War but wasn't Glasnost supposed to be the time we allied with Russia, when we won the war and caused Russia to become a capitalist nation? Didn't they comply and change towards a new government? Why then, did we leave them alone and never even encouraged them to change by making them economic allies.Who is more evil, the kid who does crimes, or the bad father who raised the kid wrong with no conscience? We mock the Russian people by killing them by the thousands in movies, those who we defeated, allied with, then abandoned like trash in just a few years time.Anyway Nobody is really high impact, very good performances by all involved. Really fun. I am just saying, its time to think if we are overly dehumanizing Russians and where this hatred is coming from because obviously all of these bad people could be generic white people, Chinese, or use your imagination, aliens, for some reason the ruling elites want us to hate Russians for their own goals. Try to watch examples of real Russia and balance your understanding and see that they are good meaning humans like you or I perhaps led by an evil dictator.",Nobody

If anything it gives you just what you need to know and then gets on with the story line and once it takes off, it's relentless all the way through to the end, blink and you'll miss something.This movie shows that an action star does not have to be ripped or look like a pretty boy and if anything would not have been the same if he was because like the movie title, he is nobody, he could be the guy you sit next to at work and you would never know what he has been through.Special shout out to Christopher Lloyd, what an appearance, not what you would expect at all and yet just like the rest of the movie and story, it works somehow.

But, it does escalate fairly quickly, after the basis to the plot is sustained, kind of like the beginning of the John Wick: Chapter 1 start's out and then quickly escalates gradually and it's got plenty of action and blood to it, for a great beginning to a ""chaptered"" story, similar to that of John Wick has been. Which, not to praise another movie so much, but they are a lot alike, but different in the right way's. Probably because the same guy wrote or directed them both. Ok, there are a lot of ""Easter Egg's"" in the movie to watch for, like symbol's and phrase's, or even the fight's, that give reference to many different thing's and how you should also pay attention to the facial expression's of the different people, as the background story unfold's and it's revealed who ""Nobody"" really is, as it come's to light, that like ""John Wick"", ""Nobody"" is somebody you don't wanna mess with!(LOL) But, I should mention how Christopher Lloyd played his part, perfectly! All I can say is, don't be expectin ""Doc Brown"" from Back To The Future to be in the movie. I mean, each of the actor's, played their part's right, especially the main character's, as they had the right expression's on their face's and it just came out right.

When he was promoting this on talk shows he explained that he actually trained for this athletically and in martial arts for two years. And he did all his own fight scenes; no stunt man!But the action is silly and ridiculous. The action sequences were designed by the same guy/group that did the John Wick movies. If you like the John Wick movies, you might like them. But if you're like me and think the John Wick actions scenes are silly and ridiculous then, no. They're laughable. This reads as a parody of action films instead of being one. That's unfortunately further exacerbated by the audience being so familiar by Bob Odenkirk's other great comedy writing and characters before this. It's almost like he's punished by having been so good at doing comedy before. Some scenes here are so ridiculous you start laughing.(Quick example for when you see it: what a great convenience that there was duct tape just coincidentally hanging right there.)Lastly the sound track was terrible; generic. Playing a bunch of old melodramatic 50's songs and shifting to slow-motion as if that sprinkles ""poetic and artistically done"", instead of making original compositions. Hell you may as well sprinkle Mozart and Beethoven instead to make an even worse, overdone cliche soundtrack.In conclusion if you're they type of viewer who's like ""hey it's just a movie relax"", then you'll love it. If you're the ""ok come on this is just ridiculous"", such as myself, you won't.5/10 just because Bob Odenkirk and his effort were applaudable. What a great, hard-working, prolific, talented man...

He relies more on experience, over fancy stunts.This doesn't make it less entertaining, rather more engaging.I do have a friend, who goes by the name AMG. Yeah! Like the gun.

791,keridb,A cerebral Action flick,9,30 June 2021,"I've seen many people compare this to John Wick...or similar action flicks. But in my opinion, it's much deeper than that.First- let's do a LTDR: (NO SPOILERS)
Good production and acting. Interesting premise. And I can see the comparisons to JW...but more like if John had been married for 25-ish years & had a couple kids.Besides that, my hubby & I thoroughly enjoyed this movie & bought it the next day.Longer review- (SPOILERS):
I call this a cerebral action because ""Nobody"" is actually self-aware. He says to his father ""I over-corrected"". To me, that means, he knows he went from a life of extreme violence, to a pacifist. But that's not even the best part.The best parts are the dynamic with his family, his imperfect re-introduction to the life, and the juxtaposition of his childhood family-VS-adult family.He loves his wife & children, but it's not a perfect life....it's the one he chose. His relationship ship with his wife is strained; like any marriage after a decade (or two, or three). The father-daughter dynamic is what drew me in...it's how those relationships are supposed to be like.But the re-introduction is what sets it apart. It's not a typical ""doting father & husband"" loses his entire family and goes on a retribution rampage.Nope! It's a flippin kitty-cat bracelet....that brings the story full-circle near the end.But one night of avenging the ""theft"" of his daughters bracelet.... reopened him a history of violence. And now he never wants to return to mundane suburban life. Stupid trash days!Personally, I don't think the violence was over the top. I think it was fitting for the task at hand. A little cheesy & not entirely realistic (like JW strives for... EX: the claymore & riot shield? Yea, No. No one could survive that.)
But the violence serves a purpose. It has the vulnerability of Jackie Chan movies, the methodical execution of JW, the retribution of History Of Violence, and the patients of The Accountant. It is also a testimony to how he was, most likely, raised.The main thing I actually found fascinating.... was that we never truly find out if his wife ""KNEW"" about his past... or merely suspected. And I actually kind of like that ambiguity.In summation this movie is packed full of ""diabolical"" action, subliminal heart warming family ties, and a slow-burn escalation into a satisfying crescendo.If you're in a loooong term relationship, you'll appreciate the clever approach to family dynamic.My hubby & I definitely recommend.",Nobody

793,arikiczkowski,A Brilliant Mashup,10,8 September 2021,"One of the reviews here described this as John Wick meets Home Alone. Watching it, we heard echoes of Die Hard and Falling Down. There always even a moment that made me think of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight.It's hard to say there is anything really original here, but the execution is excellent. The action is very violent, but well choreographed and not overly gory. The tone of the movie is serious, but there are moments of dark humor that feel almost subversive and surprising without feeling out of place. Bob Odenkirk manages to make his role both sympathetic to the audience and believably menacing to the bad guys.I will admit that I typically disengage my brain when I'm watching an action movie, so plot holes? Don't know, don't care. Nothing was glaring enough to get past that barrier and register. Just 90 minutes of glorious mayhem that passed so quickly that I was amazed so much time had passed.No spoilers. You'll know where it's going five minutes in, even if you haven't read a short description or seen a trailer, but in this case, getting there is a great deal of fun, and worth the price of admission.",Nobody

I understand there is a fandom of the actors from BB but this excuse of a film is just lame.The vagueness of the protagonist's back story didn't help me click into the movie at all. Instead it left me with thoughts of how hard it must be for Bob Odenkirk to shake off the character of Saul in BB. If someone else had played Hutch maybe it would be slightly more believable but alas we'll never know.In all though it's not a great story and relies too heavily on Hutch's incredible combat skills and the extraordinary incompetence of the antagonist and his associates.

It has the same bone crunchingly visceral action sequences involving multiple casualties, the same professional killer reluctantly coming out of retirement plotline and mainly takes place in the same style of urban, industrial, neon landscapes. The main difference is perhaps in the choice of lead actor, Bob Odenkirk is an unlikely choice for this type of role, but he plays the action hero very effectively and adds some interesting layers to his character (although anything must seem like a step down after Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad). The film doesn't take itself particularly seriously, which helps offset some of the more outlandish and unrealistic story elements and there are some genuinely funny moments. The action is very well done, with an early fight on a bus a particularly stand out, but by the end of the film and the inevitable climatic showdown, the whole thing unfortunately descends into familiar tropes and uninspiring set pieces, not quite delivering on the earlier promise.",Nobody

So he let them go without incident. Then he gets a loaded gun to break into the burglars house, then Hutch empties his gun to fight four hardened men on a bus.Knowing whether the wife knew Hutch's past seemed to waiver every time she was in the movie.There were a couple spots in the movie that were just forced, like the tattoo parlor scene, or the scene where Hutch buys the factory.

A failing family man who is respected by no one, not even his son. One day, he snaps off after surviving some criminals, and goes off berserk. And that's all there is to the premise. No dead dog, or dead family member.While Christopher Lloyd's presence is welcome, RZA's isn't. Nor any other characters are well portrayed, including a cliched villain.By the end, it becomes a worse mess than John Wick Chapter 3's second half, now here's a proper JW comparison.Editing of action sequences decide if they are thrilling, or dull, and as said above, except the bus fight every other one looks crap.

At the time, I thought the sketch comedy program was hit or miss - a first impression that made me ambivalent about Odenkirk until his debut as smarmy lawyer Saul Goodman on Breaking Bad. He's so damn good at playing the immature, impetuous criminal lawyer who wants to do good yet consistently does bad when faced with the alluring freedom attached to criminal behavior. My perception of Odenkirk and his acting abilities was seriously starting to shift. Still, I wondered how much of Saul was just Odenkirk in assorted garish, custom-made suits. I didn't know if he could bring the same brilliance to a different character. The last character I expected him to pull from his bag of tricks was the lead badass in a balls-to-the-wall, shoot-em-up action flick. So when I learned about ""Nobody,"" I had major reservations. I imagine my reaction was similar to the way audiences first responded to seeing Bruce Willis in ads for 'Die Hard.' Kind of a 'yeah right, there's no way this aging comedian can pull this off' type of vibe.Well, I've seen it. And Odenkirk has made me a believer. Even though it was surreal to see him playing a bone-crushing, Uzi-toting, grenade-tossing one-man army, I bought the performance and really enjoyed it. There's nothing particularly new about the storyline - a normcore suburban dad named Hutch Mansell (with a mysterious past à la John Wick) intentionally avoids getting violent during a home-invasion robbery. Afterwards, he gets grief for acting like a wussy from his family and pretty much everyone on the face on the planet. This unlocks his inner beast who goes on a rage-fueled bender of finely-choreographed mayhem that quickly involves the entire Russian mafia. It's an absurd, wry, pulpy b-movie extravaganza of ultra-violence that works thanks to Odenkirk's complete commitment. Definitely worth checking out.",Nobody

One day, he breaks, and he gets involved in a powerful mob's wrong-doings.

I didn't really know what it was about, who wrote it, who directed it, etc.It has been a while since I watched a movie that grabbed my interest and kept it throughout. So many movies these days get so ridiculously phony that it is insulting. It is one thing to stretch realism a bit in order to create something exciting, but far too many try so hard that even spoof films are more realistic. This film had a decent balance of realism, movie action, humor, etc. And unlike taken, the Bourne films, etc. This film didn't do the shaky cam and 10 cuts for one punch. I know that this film is not a part of the John Wick franchise/universe but it parallels it.

Odenkirk puts action as well as his signature wittiness in creating a multidimensional character that no one wants to wake up. It is not your typical action movie as the main hero is bad-ass but not invulnerable. Christopher Lloyd is as adorable as ever and he really seems to enjoy the works, as well as the rest of the crew.

918,c-glive,You've seen it before...,4,15 April 2021,"Yes, that's right: you've seen it before. John Wick, The Equalizer, Taken, The Accountant, Shoot 'Em Up, The Transporter, The Mechanic, Jack Reacher, the list goes on with some hits but mostly boring retreads, and sadly, Odenkirk's first outing as an action hero falls into the latter category. Replace a dead dog with a stolen kitty bracelent, throw in a muscle car (a 4.9L? ...really?) and you've got Nobody.The film opens with Odenkirk seemingly living the same mundane day over and over, a la Groundhog Day, so the audience of working suckers (us) can immediately identify with his character. Insert a twist, a home burglary, to finally break the camels back, and awaken the killing machine that is Odenkirk.The movie is rife with contradictions, like Odenkirk's family's basement/safe room, which also doubles as a special bone deleting furnace. The movie has the same cliche of an army of faceless hitmen encroaching on Odenkirk's suburban home, only for him to encounter them 2 at a time until they're all gone.I won't bore you with the middle, except that the movie's climax takes place at Odenkirk's work, a generic machine shop warehouse facility, where one of his former partners in crime has gained access and set up a barrage of silly Home Alone traps that Odenkirk's character is already aware of.Don't get me wrong, I love watching Bob Odenkirk, he is DEFINITELY leading man material, and he does a great job playing the character written for him here, the problem with this film is the writing. Out of everything that gets broken in the movie, none of it is new ground. Watch it, but just for Odenkirk's character, don't expect much else.",Nobody

Nobody drags an unwilling hero out of retirement. Everyone is willing to kick ass, and that's beautifully done.

So it's a pleasure to ride along as the main character wreaks havoc on those who deserve it. It's always annoying, however, when film makers either don't care about minor details or who simply think the audience is too dumb to know better. For example, Dodge never made a 4.9L engine the characters talk about.

I switched off my brain, strapped myself in and went with it. FAR OUT!!I got the sense that the film makers were fully aware of every politically incorrect transgression they made here - Stereotypical Russian gangsters, gun fetishes, not a single rounded female character all cast as nothing more than eye candy for the male gaze, Oh, and no 80s action movie is complete until the token black good guy sidekick gets shot and killed - well almost, but it was here when they really drove their point home that they were clearly poking fun at themselves and the movies they grew up watching.To sum up Nobody is a movie made by Gen X dads for Gen X dads,",Nobody

938,consumer-08498,decent story stupidly told,3,25 September 2021,"There was a a good story to be told, but Derek Kolstad, the scriptwriter, apparently did not know how to tell it. The first rule is establish a sympathetic character - in this instance, Mr. Nobody (Hutch Mansell). That essential backstory was not done. The sketch provided was ineptly done.Kolstad wrote the John Wick movies, which were okay, but could have been much better. Mr. Nobody is a 3rd-rate rehash of the Wick saga.The multiple logical plot holes in the script means that only stupid people wanting a mindless shoot-'em-up movie could possibly give this a high score - and so it goes (as usual).There's lots of shooting, and much senselessly pseudo-cryptic dialogue, but little acting in this movie. If Bob Odenkirk can actually act is unknowable from this film. He's not necessarily miscast, just a non-actor playing a nobody. The deficits are compounded by directorial incompetence.Director Ilya Naishuller makes a lot of amateur mistakes, most poignantly relying upon iconic imagery rather than fluid action. The action sequences are rather poorly done, with the all-too-typical choppy editing rather than artful shooting that more talented directors know to employ.",Nobody

The main guy is even more of a superhero over here to the extent that he had probably defeat a terminator. It's so ridiculous that you wonder if anybody like this even remotely existed somewhere on this planet, they should just take over the planet. On the plus side, atleast the movie has some self-awareness as to how ridiculous it is. It's still a somewhat well-made movie, just keep in mind that it falls in the 'ridiculous action movie' genre , not remotely realistic action movie genre, and that it doesn't break any new ground (all the plot points have been seen before) so you'll likely will forget it after a while.",Nobody

I expected the Wick style and wasn't disappointed. But there was actually a lot more to this movie. I really love how the back story is presented in bits and pieces through the first two thirds of the flick, as well as the fact that Hutch is not even close to perfect. He's older, out of practice, and his skills come back to him the more he faces trouble. He isn't unrealistically deadly. He bleeds and takes his licks. Also, the humor is brief and subtle, placed perfectly and moved away from quickly, as this is a movie about a man who knows he wasn't good back in the day... that this is serious business.We rented this title and I watched it twice.

Interested to know how this film was pitched......hey here's an idea for a revenge action flick which is a cross between The Equaliser and John Wick and oh the main star is Sal Goodman from Breaking Bad!!Somehow this works as Bob in as an absolute bad ass in this film and carries it from start to finish. Yes we've seen this type of film time and time again but its the execution that matters and this film is executed superbly. The action scenes are slick, well edited and extremely violent. The films run time is kept to a nice 90 minutes which keeps the film pace nice and quick and its never too long before another bloodbath.One of the things I like most about this film is the casting, yes Bob is outstanding, RZA is excellent on the phone and with a huge sniper rifle, nice to see 'Jester' aka Michael Ironside but man has he put on a few pounds. The genius touch though is casting Dr Emmet Brown aka Christopher Lloyd as the dad, seeing him wield a pump action shotgun dropping bad guys left, right and centre was the high point for me in this film.

I liked that side of him a lot: not killing just because they were all bad.The dialogue was written by a youngster, though. Mopar not only did not have a 4.9 liter engine in 1972, if they did it would have been called a 300 cubic inch engine. The closest was the base engine for the 1972 Charger/Challenger: the 318. It put out 155 hp and produced a 0-60 time just under 9 seconds, about a match for my daughter's 2008 CR-V. The writer could have made it a 1971 Challenger R/T with a 350 hp 426 cubic inch hemi....

I know it's been really popular and I was inspired to give it a go because the great Mark Kermode raved about it. Plus I heard Bob Odenkirk interviewed and he came across really well and sounded like he loved making this film.However, as much as I wanted to like, I really didn't enjoy this. I found it irritating and could feel it trying so hard to be up there with films in the same genre that have already done what Nobody does, but way better and first.

1058,liedeckej,"Good Action, Too Much Hollywood Action Hero",4,16 October 2021,"TL:DR (no spoilers):
Fans of Mission Impossible, The Expendables, 80-90's Action Movies and Hollywood Hero type movies are sure to love this one.However, for me it start off good only to become a more slow-burner version of the titles I mentioned above.Plot holes and nonsense, reality-breaking and a main-character that only can be hurt for 20 seconds of screen-time.Beautiful action shots and perfect fight sequences with a very talented cast.!!**Disclaimer: No spoilers, though references to specifics actions that happened in the movie:**!!If you're into the type of movie that has lots of plot holes, lots of inconsistencies, and a main character that has superhuman abilities although set in a 'realistic' world but still delivers on action in the form of brilliant fight sequences and action shots, then this movie is for you.To me, I can't help but be disappointed, cause who doesn't like an underdog that turns his way around and beats everyone else to a bloody pulp?In Nobody however, there's too many times where he's shot or injured, acts like it's real bad for a 20 seconds of screen time, only to get up and act like nothing ever happened.This is put in deep contrast to the people around him in the last fight scene. Without spoiling the movie: he's shot once in the shoulder; auch that hurt, then goes on like nothing happened. His friend is then shot exactly the same way in the same spot on the shoulder, but he's now *realistically so* unable to use that arm anymore. He even says ""I came to help you, now I'm the one shot"" and I'm sitting here like 'Uhhh? You both got shot?'.I would've loved to see him beat up 5 people the way we saw in the trailer and continue to do things like that and in that way.Instead I'm fed the heavily overplayed and standardized Hollywood Action Hero movie where the enemies of the main character gets dumber and dumber the more the movie goes on.We're talking enemies that go through a door, get's shot, then his partner follows and does the same thing, and the the guys behind those two does the same thing. There's no end to it.Not to mention the many steps the main character goes through to kill people creatively instead of practically.The most disappointing part is probably that the first half of the movie is actually really engaging, it's to my taste as well. The second half however breaks down all of what it had going for it, and becomes more of a *down-tuned* slower-paced Mission Impossible.There's too much that breaks my immersion from this movie and so I give it a 4/10. This could've been done so much better.",Nobody

Being a fan of Wick- Please don't.These are two totally different characters and environments.I'm hoping they don't mess up with John Wick stretching it to 5 films...I was hoping it would have been rapped up in the 3rd installment (I don't see the first one as part of 2 & 3 despite opening two with the retrieval of his car).John Wick is a universe within a Universe.. with extreme violence that would send civilians running or bring down heavy law enforcement. The analog technology, Gun exchanges in a packed Fulton Street Subway station. Shooting a sumo sized guy in the head... slitting throats in grand central with everyone oblivious... even the cab at the onset of three the checkered cab is a stunning visual.These aren't sci-fi CGI nonsense like let's do Alien vs Predator.If they make a sequel with the Return of the Auditor... he'd have to be taken out of the environment he's in and sort of be introduced as the ""spooks"" that deal with anything related to the High Table... which after 3 films would make no sense.This was a great entertaining film...but any talk of a crossover is mind numbingly ridiculous.This was a lighter version of Denzel as the Equalizer...

An retired operative forced back to his old business and destroyed a gang. The director and the writer of this movie have put so much effort to prevent it from becoming another ""wick movie"".The real backbone of this movie is ""adjustment disorder"". Hutch , his father, his brother, and even Yulian.were all the sufferer of the same problem. All the main characters in the movie had been tainted by their own previous profession. Hutch was an secret operative that shoots to kill, Yulian was an russia gang leader that was furious and menacing. They both have their disguise, one disguised as a family man, another into a happy bar owner. Are they happy with their new role ? Yes and No, they got accustomed to the role, they played the role well but they knew that they were just not the peaceful person they pretended to be. The conflict built up inside them and exploded when given chance.The plot tension gradually built up as Hutch got himself into more and more battle. Until he killed all the assassin , placed them in the basement, he got himself the wine and music, He started his confession. That is one of the most interesting part of the movie, you can see the twisted mind of Hutch in full.The story telling of this movie is good. It can spent 40 minutes to portray a family man, and spend 30 secs to portray an mosochist IT clerk that you could easily fill up his background.The profiling of an old, obsolete russia bar owner sitting in front of the table is just mesmerizing. With 10 seconds , you knew both the physical and psychological well being of the character. Also , Hutch standing outside of the house is also very interesting use of the camera. I haven't seen one using the camera to tell story for a long time.To conclude , this movie worth your time to watch more than one time.",Nobody

1113,Bingedrinker,Goodness gracious.. Bob Odenkirk is a revelation!,9,9 May 2021,"Basically it feels like a John Wick spinoff. Lots of parallels. Apparently the story and concept was Odenkirk's own idea. But what a great one. Sometimes it is so interesting when a type of actor (Odenkirk being a talented funnyman) does something so opposite to his regular stuff. The first time I saw Odenkirk was in a lesser known comedy ""Ron Ronnie Ron"" (2002) with David Cross, as a faux British inventor of bad inventions, trying his hand at directing a petty criminal to reality TV stardom. In that movie he basically played an imbecile. He is very talented.Him as Saul in ""Breaking Bad"" and its spin-off ""Better Call Saul"", already felt as a smart move, as having a talented comedy actor tackling a shady character in a totally serious thriller-drama show. Having him, in a more advanced age, as a ""John McClane""-esque surprise, a retired assassin, is just amazing. And apart from it being an entertaining idea, he pulled off the role so well.As a huge John Wick fan, and fan in general of well-made action movies, this is a welcome addition. I hope a few sequels will be made.I am very interested also, in more unexpected castings. A recent one that I found great too, was ""Uncut Gems"". Some people don't like Adam Sandler and hate that movie. I happen to like Adam Sandler. But I found him a revelation in that too. Eddie Murphy in ""Metro"" was cool as well. Or Robin Williams in ""Insomnia"", right?Why not (if someone reads this) Mike Myers in a supremely dark thriller as a maffia hitman or something. That could be really awesome if done well.Anyway..

For example, it won't be a spoiler to say (since you see it in the trailer) that a person who misses garbage pick up every week first would end up living in a dump at his house and certainly would not have enough mental capacity to plan and set booby-traps, as this is what happens later in the movie. I don't think the director knows what is a ""character development"". It is a mystery, if main character's wife knew him before career change or not. There are some scenes that allude to some previous more exciting life for the couple and then in the other scenes the wife is totally clueless. The injuries sustained by the main character don't seem to affect his level of activity in further clips. So it is a movie without an identity. It is not a music video because it is too long. It is not a super hero movie because characters don't wear silly costumes. It is not a good old-school action movie because it is nonsensical.

We clearly see the Taxi Driver sees himself as a hero but we see him as a misguided and unfortunate villain.Why is that important you may ask? Taxi Driver knew what it was doing and was genius in it's multidimensional portrayal of someone slipping into mental insanity and vigilante justice. Relatable to Americans who live in a culture of mass shootings. Nobody doesn't seem to have anything smart to say, instead opting for a high octane ride where our vigilante is painted as a hero for murdering countless people because they annoyed him. No thought about his actions or it's various side effects for the people who he comes in contact with. All this film really does is make the idea of killing people you don't like sound 'cool'.Technically, the shots are well done and the acting is fine. It's plenty entertaining, but it's more of the same vigilante film we have been seeing rise to popularity lately except it has no interest in saying something meaningful.My advice? Skip this movie and watch Taxi Driver instead. No film has even come close to it's portrayal of vigilantism with such depth.",Nobody

1223,malchikizkurakh,Inconsistent; Simply Has No Creed,6,18 April 2021,"Nobody is one of those movies that doesn't take itself seriously, and lets the audience know of it by demonstrating its pertness via often shown comedic relief moments. Now, if it were to be one of those that builds up the audience's expectations by making them aware of its tempo and texture within the first quarter, I'd be perfectly fine with it, since, a shallow action flick that's consistently honest with itself would be welcome by anyone who's looking to blow some steam off or kill some time. But this ain't it, chief.Nobody starts off dramatic, letting you know that the protagonist's life is unfamiliar with any source of excitement and desperately wants to prove that to you within the first 5 minutes. The goal of the manner the immediate following events are narrated with fall under the same sentiment as the one of the intro. Yet, the whole narration starts to give you a hint about the upcoming narration manner in which the latter half of the movie transpires with, high-tempo comedic-action that is. By the time the movie ends, you're left baffled but relieved. Significance of the internal inconsistency is compensated with the enjoyable soundtrack and action scenes.I, personally, love RZA and Bob Odenkirk's works; however separately I admire them and what they create, seeing them collaborate has given me reason to have high hopes.

1228,The_Mailman07,A disjointed mess,2,3 May 2021,"While Nobody had a reasonable premise for a good story and a lead that could have pulled it off what we are left with is a movie that really does not know what it is doing.From the opening sequence of the days rolling on in a monotonous grind we are shown the toll that this is having on Mansell (Odenkirk). But during this for the sake of a cheap laugh we are shown him missing the garbage collection repeatedly. This is a jarring inconsistency this is a character who very much appears to be a creature of habit and dots all the I's and crosses all the T""s. The comedy element is poorly inserted.The movie does not do too badly with the home invasion scene and trip to finding the thieves but from there really loses itself.Mansell's fight with the thugs on the bus gives us a gritty and messy fight with him barely coming out on top. The level of pure chance that one of the thugs is a mob bosses son really stretches anybodies suspension of disbelief.From the bus scene onward Mansell basically becomes invincible killing multiple enemies in every confrontation with little effort compared to the grit of the bus scene a jarring disconnect.The final battle between Mansell and the mob boss and his minions reminds me of nothing more than playing a video game on the easiest setting possible where there is no danger of really being beaten and jokingly moving the enemies into amusing or strange way of being killed.I will not get too much into the farcical story of mob bosses moving vast amounts of hard currency among themselves other than to say it is beyond dumb.Nobody is little more than a idea loosely held together by some action scenes that have been done much better in other movies.

This movie deserves a 10/10 and anyone who says otherwise is simply being picky and is probably amped for John wick 4, even thou we've had 3 already.

Judging by the trailer, Bob Odenkirk looked as a great cast for this role, and he doesn't dissapoint. The problem for me was the lazy script in the second half.The beggining gave me high expectations. There is hope that the characters have depth, there are dillemas, monotony but also the appreciation of family life. There is a hidden conflict in the marriage, which could be further examined. There is a lack of understanding from the teen son. You can see that Hutch saw his part of action, but that he realy wants to keep it down and live the quiet life. Even when he starts slippin' , it is shown realistically. He has second thoughts. He misses a few hits, he gets punched and it sends him down.And then, there is a connection with the ""crazy russians"", and all the reality&plausability filters are gone. The story goes down the drain. It's just a lot of shooting, a lot of bullets missing the hero, with a childish ""home alone"" like ending. There's even a senile oldtimer shooting three or more shotguns, downing the bad guys as flys. The final boss cliche is also there, and you will (not) be surprised to see that everybody is out of bullets just before that final showdown...It could have all been fine, just an action flick with no sense, and a couple of one liners. But the beggining will get your hopes up, and all the effort that went into that part will be completely wasted in the second half.",Nobody
1262,chadaku,Old elements delivering fresh experience!,7,30 April 2021,"If I hadn't known Bob Odenkirk, this film would have probably felt like something I've seen before. However, Odenkirk as the principal character in an action movie is something I have not seen before. Out of curiosity and interest, I had the see Nobody.The movie introduces no new element to the game. Odenkirk plays a retired assassin with a house and family. He gets into trouble and badassery ensues. A
framework so simple and effective for setting up entertaining violence. Violence requires action and action requires quality so here are the 3 things about the action that made it work for me:TENSION BUILD-UP QUICK AND EFFECTIVE - All the moments leading up to the fight scene in the bus. Didn't take too long and no dull moments along the way. Everything seemed so justified when the first fight broke out. ""Can Bob Odenkirk really do this?""FIGHT SCENES ARE VISCERAL. There's blood where there's supposed to be blood. No slick and clean choreography. The brawls are brutal and the main character only survives because he's a tough guy.ABUNDANCE OF ACTION - the film only moves away from the action long enough to further the story. No unnecessary off-action scenes and even if there are, I wouldn't mind because the actings are solid.Yes, it's been done before. But with Odenkirk, Nobody is an enjoyably fresh experience.In sum, this is a film I could show to my father without him sleeping it out.",Nobody
1263,irala68,Truly enjoyable,9,7 June 2021,"If you like movies such as The Punisher, John Wick, The Equaliser you are going to enjoy it although Bob Odenkirk is not the typical hero usually played by guys with strong physical presence. As he said in one of the interviews he did want his character to look like a typical dad, understated and unassuming.Interestingly, Bob Odenkirk has had an experience of two break ins and that has influenced his performance in Nobody. I guess we all sometimes fantasise about ""superhero"" things we would do to people who hurt us but Bob Odenkirk had an opportunity to act it out lol.As for acting, even though it is a completely different movie genre to what we are normally used to seeing Odenkirk in, there is always that personality that comes through. Saying that, his performance was great (Odenkirk trained for two years with Daniel Bernhardt a stunt actor, prior to making a Nobody) and Bob's personality adds interesting/ a bit different vibe to the character.Overall, great fun and a I haven't enjoyed a movie that much in a quite long time.",Nobody

The story was decent for what this is, what let it down is some very cheesy/bad writing in parts where people say things out of character which made it come across as a comedy in parts. Small plot holes that don't really add up in another scene let it down along with the really absurd action scenes where one minute the lead seems incompetent making amateur mistakes and then suddenly he's amazing.Overall I loved the style, pacing and story and even with some of the small plot holes and cheesy lines the action was overall enjoyable.It's hard not to like the movie, and really could have been great with a better editor, someone just fixing the writing and more logical action scenes.",Nobody

But fair play to the man, he smashed it. Smashed it in a similar vein to Adam Sandler in Uncut Gems, Robert Pattinson in Good Time and Jason Bateman in Ozark. All very away from their MO but all absolutely nailing it and I'm happy to say that Bobby Boi is now in that category.If you like enjoyable action, with little storyline to follow and some funny quips here and there, this is definite must watch.I'm giving it an eight on enjoyment value.

You will find the dark humor of these tv-series back in this movie. But with the deviousness in this case much much more physical, lol.With the John Wick movies as greatest example also 'Nobody' is an achievement of the re-invention of 90's action flicks with their brutal action, great oneliners, an over the top 'human' villain, a hero on steroids that defeats a whole army on his own without nearly getting hit himself (just a few flesh wounds, lol). I even had a 'The A-Team' 90's tv-series moment here! The dramatic part in the story is never strong in these kind of movies but in 'Nobody' it's good enough to emphasize with Odenkirk's character. Also thanks to good acting.Shout out to Christopher 'Back To The Future' Lloyd as the dad and Aleksey Serebryakov as the main villain. They were hilarious ^_^ And also RZA as 'radio voice' :-) I also love actor Michael Ironside but I think most of his role did not leave the editing room sadly.

The action was mostly good but someone that highly trained wouldn't have let himself get hit as many times as he did to the point of carelessness which doesn't fit his character so that made some of it kinda silly.

And that's not a bad thing. Yeah it's dumb fun. You are in for an hour and a half of Bob Odenkirk waving his hands around and a gratuitous amount of bad guys dying. It has the same feel as a call of duty shooting gallery-style campaign. And you can tell that everyone had fun making this. It's crazy to see Saul Goodman pulling off a badass tough guy role but it just works. The action is serviceable. The car shootout scene was a lot of fun. The setup to the bus scene was ridiculous but it payed off. So yeah. The characters are hilarious and ridiculous, the plot is paint-by-the-numbers John Wick, but the movie is so much fun. I have never seen a movie this fast paced. The move felt like it was only 35 minutes because it never takes time to relax. And that's my takeaway. I haven't seen a movie that I can both roll my eyes at and laugh at while also having such a good time and a big grin on my face. It knows what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything else.

It does seem that the fact that his daughter's bracelet had been stolen (or so it appeared) was the straw that broke the camel's back. A bit far fetched if you ask me...What's with grandpa in a retirment home anyway?

1427,foolishcop-589-147477,"Starts Strong, Finishes Less So",5,24 April 2021,"Most of the reviews have encapsulated this movie correctly, both those that liked it and those that didn't. Definitely John Wick Meets Kevin McAllister, but Bob Odenkirk does a good job of selling the Nobody aspect of his character. It's a little implausible how he gets drawn back into the life (though you can have a meaningful willing suspension of disbelief), but it kind of goes off the rails as it progresses. There was definitely a lot left on the cutting room floor to make it fit the 1-1/2 hr run time, but you wouldn't want the movie to have gone on any longer than that.It was a serviceable action movie with a good amount of action and violence that didn't get bogged down in relationship issues (despite the movie revolving around Odenkirk's family life). It's worth a watch and you won't be disappointed if you go in understanding what you'll be getting. I thought the payoff at the end was weak, though -- which is where all the Home Alone references come from -- and it could have gone for less over the top chicanery to resolve the movie. In short, if you've got 90 minutes or so to kill, it's not terrible. Not great by any stretch, and certainly not as good as I had hoped based on the trail, but a mostly entertaining yarn.",Nobody

We see our protagonist living a mundane life, which has us impatiently anticipate the adversarial forces cross his path. Except we are given nothing but tongue-in-cheek layers of his past and tasteless action sequences. The degree of violence and brutality was satisfyingly ephemeral as there was nothing remotely novel. Our antagonists are unnaturally revealed using the same Russian Mobster tropes we've grown tired of since 2014.Film felt too much of a carbon copy; the settings and places of the action scenes are clear rehashes of John Wick and The Equalizer; and the film's score is a shoddy take at Tyler Bates' adrenaline-laced tactical music.I've already forgot about the movie. 5/10 is what I'll remember.",Nobody

He played a more believable character in Better Call Saul as well as Breaking Bad.There were a few spots in the movie where the action outpaced the snarky and comedic responses which fell flat.

1438,dreiz,Disappointed,4,21 April 2021,"Being really appreciative of Odenkirk's work, I wanted to like this movie and did to some extent, but there are just too many cheap sides to this flick. Dialogue is bad, the concept of the unsuspecting family man turning out to be a killing machine has been done many times over and way better than this.Staging is pretty bad although it all feels quite cinematic, some shots and situations don't make sense. To illustrate this, take a specific shot at about the 1h20 mark with a lovely cinematic sequence that completely forgets the points of view of the ""bad guys"" (bad guy doesn't see Christopher Loyd's character right in front of him because the camera (we) doesn't see him yet... that's the level). Another shot earlier in the movie where the main ""bad guy"" shoots his automatic rifle 3m away from the protagonist's driver-side door and somehow misses him. This kind of incoherence ruins it for me because it screams that the hero is not in any danger.The morality of this whole thing dubious at best in my opinion. The ""good guy"" protagonist used to execute people who stole money from the US government, as if courts of law didn't exist, and as if that's commendable in any way... Also encourages his teenage son to tackle armed intruders after thinking about it for a day (because his son was disappointed in him for not brutally hitting their assaillants with a golf club), is glad to witness harassment just so he can express his violent side, and doesn't show much respect for any part of his family life throughout the movie.Action sequences are on the whole pretty enjoyable but this all feels like a cheap, rushed, done many times over movie.",Nobody

Here's what I think makes it worthwhile: clean, clever cinematography; smooth character development specifically by ""Hutch"" but support cast also good; cracking sound track; funny while steering clear of Hollywood one liners; action scenes are beautifully and gruesomely choreographed with a bit of pain for both sides.If you can safely see it in a cinema go for it, it's worth catching it on big screen if you can, but if not I recommend you see it anyway you can.",Nobody

I also enjoyed seeing Christopher Lloyd in this as the wiley old man (Hutch's dad) with a tricks up his sleeve as well as the Rza.I think a slight criticism would be that his relationship with his wife wasn't explored a bit more and that his wife became a bit of a cameo role but maybe this will be elaborated upon more in any sequel(s)

1595,dsvg-04506,"Maybe John Wick's same plot, but handled different",8,16 April 2021,"Hutch, an average dude with an average lifestyle is pushed by a situation to get back to his old ways, you've seen that before? I do, does that mean Nobody is a John Wick's rip-off? Not at all, even though it's the same writer of that movie, Nobody comes off as a different instalment of the action-thriller type film.The main character's mindset is actually different, basically a man trying to live family lifestyle gets overwhelmed by this by bad reasons; the monotony of his life bugs him, and we can see it on his face... Surprisingly, one night a couple of thieves kick the door, seems like an opportunity to unleashed rage, but that doesn't happen and he got robbed and humiliated. Looking to let loose, he end up in a series of situations, but in a short form, he met with the wrong peopleI'd like to say the highs and lows of this film, and some differences of certain productions as well.Cool stuff:
The development of our main character: In the first instance we know Hutch as a monotony, boring, loser and resentful guy, looking a way to let loose he met the wrong people, throughout we see his attitudes and backstory, how his brother tries to keep the beast inside of him caged, and how his recklessness takes him to his old ways.Action scenes and realism: We've seen so many times how our hero domains even though he's a really old guy, almost like a perfect man, but not here. Hutch can take a punch once in a while, he got beat down twice in the movie and stabbed by the beginning, so we know he's old and human. It might be me, but it's something I've never seen on this genre.It is worth mentioning the creativity on the hand-to-hand fight scenes and how he managed to use anything around him to fight back and kill his enemies.The acting: Tbh, I wasn't sure about the decision of Bob Odenkirk as a kick-ass, but I was impressed how they made a sensitive and nice guy to a tough one, this was possible to Bob's acting skills, he shines by himself portraying pain and frustration.The direction: the fights, the music choice (most of it) and the camera work are really good. I love all hand-to-hand encounters, the main montage was really beautiful and informative, and I love a couple shots of the movie, while burning the money and hitting the wall in the alley, those were good looking. I have to mention the car scape was funny to see, how he managed to escape was unexpected. A minor detail that I love was the moment he broke the car window with a fist, while we are used to seen our heroes breaking car windows with elbows, but this was different (even though it's almost impossible), like if the main character was really powerful to pull that off.Good timing and comedy relief: Oftenly on the movie we get a few jokes, as a sign that we don't have to take that serious this movie, also I liked how Ilya make the movie one hour and half runtime, just keeping the essential and not stretching the story.Not so cool stuff:
Some music choice: I like a lot of it by the beginning, the Nina Simone cover of don't let me be misunderstood was interesting and what a wonderful world too. But sometimes in some dialogue the music setting was kinda boring, that happened with some action scenes too just to make you feel excited, but rock music is oftenly used a lot for this kind of encounters, and use to be overwhelming. Sometimes minimalism helps to enjoy the moment, and I think it would be better.Final gun fight: Even though I had a lot of fun watching Christopher Lloyd and the RZA, it didn't feel down to earth, they might be capable of that, but still it's unbelievable. (I have to say I love the three kills shot)Villain: I know he wasn't the centre of the movie, not a bad one after all, we know his motivations and attitudes, but to me he wasn't so interesting to watch, although he just works as the threat.Differences:
I would say Hutch is really different to his predecessors, While a lot of characters come out of the shadows because of revenge (Robert McCall, John Wick and Bryan Mills), Hutch just want a reason to let loose, in a surface level we could say he did by revenge, but in the autobus we see him wishing somebody hurt him just to take off the frustration inside of him, he just want a dose of ultraviolence to calm his old self, but this brought consequences and he has to face 'em.",Nobody

I was in the mood for a first-person action, but alas... Nevertheless, I think the film will be remembered. It turned out bright, not boring, sometimes exciting.

1603,eggroll-13735,Above average,7,16 April 2021,Bob Odenkirk did an amazing job in the film especially in all the action sequences. After learning that he spent a long time training for the movie does make it a lot better and more authentic. It's somewhat of a John Wick spin off but having that mind set before watching the movie may ruin it a little if you're looking for more of an action thriller. The movie really felt like an 80s action flick with all the montages and music but I feel that's what makes it different from the John Wick films. There is a some good gun fu to look forward to but not too much. In my opinion I wouldn't go rush to the theaters to see it but if need something to kill some time it's not a bad choice.,Nobody

1622,ntselikov,Good action movie,8,16 April 2021,"Taking some tough guys with me, I go to watch a new action movie from Ilya Naishuller. I also remember the previous film Hardcore Henry, where the main character in the first person smashes enemies. In general, the new film is about the same. A retired former security official lives the life of a simple family man and in his heart misses the past days of war. The chance gives the family man a reason to reveal his full potential in practice.Scenes of combat clashes, fights, shootings are done perfectly. For some reason I especially liked the chase scene - shooting and editing are good.There are illogical moments that make you laugh. For example, during a shootout in a house, the crowd does not run to the sound of gunfire, but calmly prowls around the house further. Or a collision of an enemy car with a pillar: frame 1 - the car goes into the pillar, frame 2 - the car is lying overturned on the roof.In the film, a woman is twice shown as a criminal thug. Well, a woman is also a person, the message is clear.Bob Odenkirk in the russian dub speaks in a low, brutal voice. It is interesting to hear if it was re-voiced in the original. Serebryakov amused, annealing to the national pop-music of the 90s - like a chemist from Zhmurki. I believe that the Russian Ethiopian in the film is also a reference to Balabanov.There is not a single nudity in the film, only blood, meat, shooting, stabbing, bones, fragments of teeth. For a deeper immersion, one could throw away the dialogues.",Nobody

1680,tilljonas,Better than John Wick?,9,9 July 2021,"Everybody heared it before they go into cinema: ""It's like John Wick."" And I have to admit, if you like John Wick, you will probably like Nobody, too. There will be action, there will be one man in a so called ""mid-life-crisis"" who kills some bad people. But now I have to say, it's not a copy from John Wick just with other cast. I think Nobody can stand for itself, all that relations to John Wick were obviously marketing decisions (author from JW). If I compare it to John Wick, I have to mention two points: 1. Nobody has less action than JW (but still a lot). 2. Therefore Nobody is a bit more brilliant in terms of filmmaking. Nobody takes a bit more time to tell the story, which doesn't feel
unnecessary. There are no flashbacks to his past, they reveal things about him in the right time and you will have some moments of ""Oouh, yeah that makes sence"". They made a good harmony between story and a lot of action. Even if there is a lot of violence, it's somehow justified. In order to that I have to mention, that the trailers are a bit misleading, because the trailer shows a 'Nobody' who was someday a somebody who is now willling to do some action (but isn't that tragic anyway). NOW we have to talk about music and editing.....TEN out of TEN!!!!!!!!!! Unbelievable, really. So well paced editing, no matter if you look on that montage at the beginning or at the action scenes through the movie, they did it goddamn right. They are on the right spots slow, they are on the right spots fast. They improved that movie and impressed me. That in combination with the music by David Buckley was a dream of a idk-what-to-say.So, is Nobody better than John Wick??? Well, that depends on the viewer. If you just like pure action with a badass guy with some badass moves, you will like Nobody, but love John Wick. In my case, I like John Wick but love Nobody, because it has that little extras that I mentioned above. So for these extras it's for me okay, that the kill-count isn't that high like John Wicks.My opinion: Nobody>John Wick (WOW that sounds like a play on words)",Nobody

However in those movies the characters are always reluctantly drawn back in and mournfully go about using their ""unique skills"" to protect their families or extract revenge.In Nobody, Hutch can barely suppress his excitement at getting to finally let down the façade of the quite family man, practically bursting into laughter as the pursuing Russian mob shreds his stolen car with automatic weapons fire.

First thing I wish they did different is to have something meaningful ""go wrong"" or ""go bad"" during the first home invasion. Not a death necessarily but a wounded family member perhaps. That would have been a nice way to mislead the audience that this was just a normal angry father going after the bad guys.Next thing. The end scene where the whole office is booby trapped (ala home alone), maybe I missed it, but how does his dad and the special forces guy know about all the booby traps etc? Also didn't seem like trio I was really rooting for at any point, very slapstick etcLast thing. Here we go again with a Russian family member who hates their own son/nephew whatever but feels the need to avenge blood, feels played out and empty. Maybe the ""fill in the blank mob"" can just simply want revenge for one guy messing up their crew, or maybe have the mobster Don respect his son/nephew and want to protect his family just like the main character ie common ground.I don't like Odenkirk much but though he was pretty good in this film, I wish they would have tweaked a few things to make the motivations have more believable etc. Not mad I spent $$$ to see this at AMC (our drafthouse is still closed).",Nobody

Making comments like, you've seen it before or it's just like John wick. Sadly they miss 2 important points about this film.Firstly, we have seen everything in films before anyway (John wick wasn't original either). It's actually reached a point where I can tell what will happen in the majority of films within the first 30 minutes. That doesn't mean they can't be good films.Secondly, there's one massive difference in this film compared to similar ones, this one is believable for once. Tired of seeing people hit in the face with metal bars, fire extinguishers, repeatedly punched in the face and always getting up and carrying on fighting like nothing has happened? Well not here you won't. It actually shows how a real fight would go down. They get hit, they actually feel it and it hinders them massively. It also doesn't do the old cliche of watching the protagonist winning at first, then looking like he'll lose then suddenly become an unstoppable machine like some inspirational drivel.I finished watching this and turned round to the Mrs (who also loves it) and said finally a believable film that isn't saturated in American movie excess like so many others.My advice, take of what it is. An action film without all the unbelievable nonsense. Oh and one finial bonus, things don't blow up unnaturally just for the sake of it too.By far by favourite film this year so far.

1761,akashnilbasak,Awesome,8,28 July 2021,"An old-school action popcorn film. Pure and simple.I won't recap the plot or anything but observe that Odenkirk has a lot of fun in this and is great in a kind of ""nobody"" sort of way. John Wick he is not, but he nails what he is supposed to be. Everyone looks like they're having the time of their lives in this. Especially Christopher Lloyd. And that's so much better than cheesy action films that take themselves too seriously.The movie is 91 minutes. There's not a lot of time for story or exposition. And that's fine. There's enough comedic beats and the movie is aware of how patently absurd it is. Every time Hutch goes off monologuing someone literally dies- that's how irrelevant the story basically is and the creators are aware of it.You're there to see Christopher Lloyd grinning maniacally with a shotgun in his hand, you're not there for even the world-building of John Wick. There's hints of world building there- Hutch's wife Becca *obviously* knows his past. As much as I want to know about that, I'm fine that they never explain why she's so phlegmatic about super-gluing knife wounds back together. But this movie doesn't even show a world like Wick's, it just whispers it in the quite moments before someone gets beaten to death with a bus railing.And being free of even that light blanket of restraint, I'll say that Nobody is better paced than John Wick 3 was. Wick 3 had the problem of being intended to be the final Wick film and instead is turned into the midpoint. Because Nobody is so bare bones, it can focus on pacing- the plot, what there is, serves as breathing room for action scenes. It's not complicated moviemaking, but it does precisely what it needs to do.Finally, this idea of action films being stuntperson-driven, with intense actor training for long, complicated action shots is a winning formula. Keanu Reeves established this with John Wick, and if they can make Odenkirk into a murdering machine it shows the formula has legs. I'm looking forward to seeing them work the genre and explore today's set of actors who are willing to undergo intense stunt training to do these kinds of movies. They are breathtakingly more entertaining than the CGI pileups of the Marvel movies and are probably a fraction of the cost too.",Nobody

Overpowered characters to the point of making it funny. I don't say overpowered meaning that it sucks, it actually rocks because that's the point of the movie.

1856,patrickleecousa,Stop comparing this to John Wick,10,8 August 2021,"This film has its own plot and needs to be judged on its own merits. All of these negative reviews that I am seeing are mentioning John Wick and their hatred for that franchise is being unfairly projected onto this film.I believe that the writers and cast did a superb job of putting this film together and I found the action to be refreshingly unique. The action was filmed in a watchable fashion as opposed to the current method of spinning a 360° camera on a gimble in a million different directions to try and force an ""action enhancement"" that gives so many people micro-seizures.The action sequences were well choreographed and incredibly fluid with only a handful of continuity errors. The gunplay was very well presented and only had 2 instances of ""Hollywood magazine capacity.""",Nobody

1860,hilienseal,Great family action,8,2 July 2021,"The quarantine period was, to put it mildly, not very rich in films, and during this time, I think, many began to forget what it was like to sit in the semi-darkness watching the action on the screen. However, right now Ilya Naishuller decided to present his Hollywood debut to the world. New faces in the capital of cinema are always a pleasant sight, but it is even more pleasant when such newcomers make good films. As for me, Naishuller is just that.When the first trailer came out, only the lazy didn't compare him to John Wick. It is not surprising, because the producer of ""Nobody"" is the creator of the franchise about the harsh dog lover - Derek Kolstad. However, to see a film about John Wick without John Wick himself would be very inappropriate and ridiculous, despite how actively the series about him is gaining momentum, acquiring sequels and a future series. My fears were quickly dispelled when I heard in an interview with the director of the film that he himself perfectly sees the similarity of the trailer with the well-known franchise, but, as Ilya Naishuller assured, the film will be about something else.Nobody is a great example of a modern action movie that skillfully uses recognizable elements of the action genre from the 2000s and 90s, as well as from several other popular films of recent years, but does it in a different way.The main character wants to live a quiet life, but the intrusion of robbers into his apartment breaks this idyll. However, instead of responding to the offenders, Hutch (the main character) chooses not to interfere, because he does not want to return to the past. But the would-be robbers made a fatal mistake - they stole a bracelet with a cat from Hutch's daughter. The analogy suggests itself. ""Yes, it's John Wick!"" - someone may exclaim. However, everything is a little different. In The Wick, the dog was essentially the only reminder John had from his late wife. In ""Nobody"" there is a leitmotif about the family. And the lack of a bracelet, which grieves the daughter of the protagonist, forces Hutch to return him.Hutch's emotional outburst scene is very similar to the scene from Joker. But the killing of hooligans by Arthur was out of despair and a desire to pull himself together, to stop being a scapegoat, and in ""Nobody"" the main character wants to deal with the rowdy in order to throw out the anger that has accumulated in him because of the jokes of colleagues and attacks on his masculinity problems with his wife and children, days that pass the same way like Hutch is the hero of the movie Groundhog Day.The guys that Hutch knocked off, exactly like him, turned out to be not so simple. One of them was the son of the main antagonist of the film (Alexei Serebryakov) and, concurrently, the leader of the Russian mafia. Sounds familiar too? A similar scene from John Wick comes to mind again. Only there is the opposite: the son of the main antagonist crossed the road to the main character.""Angry Russians? Again? Yes, this is a cliché! "" - can also be heard in conversations about this film. Only the Russians in this film are really Russians, and not people of different nationalities who speak a language incomprehensible to anyone except themselves, which is very remotely reminiscent of the great and mighty. Clichés are not taboo at all in cinematography. This element makes the film more understandable and closer to the viewer. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, Russians in the United States have been excessively mythologized to create a nonexistent threat. Therefore, it is understandable why there are many negative characters in American films with Russian roots.These similar elements with other films are competently exploited, which makes the film more understandable for the viewer, but at the same time it offers something new, because all the motives, causes and effects are completely different.It was not in vain that Naishuller said that leaving the cinema would leave a smile on his face. This is truly a family movie, only for an older family. It was here that the family helped the protagonist resist the Russian mafia and there was a great scene in the finale, where Hutch's wife, when buying a new house, asks: ""Is there a basement here?"" - which means the wife of the protagonist truly loves him and is ready to put up with his difficult past.In this movie, all of the themes he set work as they should. This is a great genre film, of which there are not so many lately. Cool, even inventive in some moments, action, selection of music, appropriate humor and a simple understandable plot - this is all that is needed for a good family film, which ""Nobody"" is indisputably.",Nobody

They come after him and he manages to kill about 300 russians along with 90 y old pops and a washed up rapper (has to be a black guy as the hero right to satisfy the equality and what not in movies).Its a fkin joke and a total waste of my time.
