0,TheLittleSongbird,Freaky Friday,7,6 January 2018,"'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all of. Is 'Friday the 13th' an original film in terms of overall story? No, having been, and still is, compared to 'Halloween' (released two years earlier). One can see why somewhat, it is derivative in a way but to me it didn't come over as a direct rip off. 'Friday the 13th' is far from the best when it comes to acting, excepting Betsy Palmer (very good) and Adrienne King (charming). The others are average at best, though it was interesting to see Kevin Bacon in an early role pre-stardom.Nor is it the best when it comes to dialogue. Much of it is very crude and cheesy. Or character development, while the characters are actually still easy to sympathise with to some extent they are stereotypes that we don't know an awful lot about generally. However, while it may not be a ""great"" film, 'Friday the 13th' is great guilty pleasure fun and it is very easy to understand its popularity and influence. It's very gory and gruesome, though not pointlessly so, but it is also very frightening and suspenseful. This is apparent in the deaths, which couldn't have been more creative or shocking, and the hauntingly eerie music score. 'Friday the 13th' is assuredly directed and moves along at a lively pace. The late reveal is for the better and works very well. The climax is a long way from a petering out one, instead the film goes out on a very strong bang, right up to the unexpected and freaky final jolt clearly inspired by 'Carrie'. Overall, good fun and very scary even if not exactly classified as great. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Friday the 13th
1,Leofwine_draca,Slasher classic is derivative and influential at the same time,7,19 July 2016,"This is the film that launched the successful Friday the 13th series, one of the three longest-running horror movie series of the late 20th century (along with the HALLWOEEN and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series). Spawning eight sequels (or thereabouts) to date and even a television series, there must be something that makes Friday the 13th distinctive - and a standout from the crowd. But upon viewing, it's difficult to know what, as the film is very derivative and similar to a lot of other horror films of the time. There's certainly nothing very memorable. But a bit of digging beneath the surface will soon undercover some interesting points about this 'original' (hah) classic.So what is there to like? Is it the plot? Not a chance. Widely derivative (influences are clear, ranging from Bava's A BAY OF BLOOD, even the setting, to the more recent HALLOWEEN), the plot is simply an excuse to set up the series of murders. The characters and situations are clichéd and all obey the 'rules' smartly observed in Wes Craven's SCREAM. The unknown identity of the killer is kept secret, which is nothing new, although the twist ending was unexpected when first seen.The setting is a nice one, and quite influential (in the glut of films that followed, such as THE BURNING), but it's nothing spectacular - just a venue for the deaths, really. So is it the acting which is commendable? Sadly not. All the actors and actresses playing the teens are uninteresting, playing oversimplified characters with basic drives, and therefore lacking in any real depth or intrigue. Adrienne King is a pretty bland lead, and we don't really care what happens to her. The only 'teenager' of note is a young Kevin Bacon, in a film he probably wants to forget about these days. The interest lies in the adult characters in the cast.Firstly Steve is slightly weird and perverse, and a little more interesting than the kids, although he serves the same type of purpose that Scatman Crothers served in the 1980 version of THE SHINING. There's a sarcastic policeman to add to the blend, as well as Crazy Ralph, whose mutterings that the teenagers are doomed reminds one of Private Fraser from DAD'S ARMY. Betsy Palmer, although appearing briefly (she is not on screen for more than 15 minutes), overacts wildly as Mrs Voorhees. There is also something immediately repulsive in her face, and the scenes where she talks to Jason in her head are quite disturbing in an amusing way.What the film does have going for it is an effective music score, which really adds to the atmosphere in some scenes. And the film does have a few atmospheric moments, especially in the scenes before the deaths where you know there's a killer lurking around in the shadows. These attempts at atmosphere are commendable, although not as effective as something like, I'll say the obvious choice, HALLOWEEN. On the opposite end of the scale, there are some graphic murder scenes (although not as many as you might think) courtesy of gore master Tom Savini, including an axe in the face and the highlight of the film, a clever scene where Kevin Bacon has an arrow head shoved through his neck from below. There are also lots of very bloody and realistic corpses for some shock scenes.Seen today, Friday the 13th has dated a little, and the film is rather too bland and simple for its own good, with not much time being spent on characterisation. It also feels rather mean-spirited and cynical. Saying that, if you want to watch a slasher film then you could do a lot worse. As the pretty piano music plays over an idyllic lake at the end of the film, you just know something horribly lurks under the surface...",Friday the 13th
2,SnoopyStyle,Start of a franchise,6,19 March 2014,"It's 1958 at Camp Crystal Lake, camp counselors Barry and Claudette sneak off but are killed by an unseen assailant. Then it flashes to 'The Present'. It's June 13th, 1979, Steve Christy is trying to reopen the camp. Everybody says the place is cursed. The camp counselors are hunted and killed.I'll give it an extra point for starting a whole new franchise. I'm just not convinced that it's either scary or dramatic. There are some bloody effects but there are bloodier before this. This was really an attempt by studio to replicate the success of Halloween by using another 'scary' date. There's also a young Kevin Bacon in this. It's just not very exciting.",Friday the 13th
3,Prismark10,Slash camp,3,15 September 2015,"Friday the 13th is a notorious slasher horror very much from the word go hence the multiple sequels over the years. Its also notable for an early appearance by Kevin Bacon who plays one of the camp counsellors.The film is set in Camp Crystal where a group of horny teenagers also known as camp counsellors are getting ready to refurbish Camp Crystal Lake some years after it was shut down when some people were killed.The town loon, Crazy Ralph warns the kids to get out but we see them being killed off in a gory manner by an unseen killer.What these kids have not been told that in the late 1950s a young boy named Jason drowned in the lake because the camp counsellors were too busy having sex to notice he needed help.The film has gory effects from Paul Savini. If you have seen previous films where he has been involved then there is nothing new in those throats being slashed scenes. As for the rest of the film you have kids being horny, playing strip monopoly over the course of the night but like the far superior film Halloween they are being stalked and murdered.Not all of the film takes place at night, there is an eerie scene when one person hitches a lift in a van but you kind of felt that would also had given the murderer away.I felt that for some portions of the film it was rather dull and boring. Kind of thought that some scenes were purely filler to pad out the running time.There was also a lot of stupidity by our heroine after the killer is revealed such as the killer being knocked out and our heroine decides to stop and rest for a bit!Its regarded as a low budget classic but it lacked a lot of tension and thrills but it does deliver in gore even though its now dated and even looks tame today.",Friday the 13th
4,claudio_carvalho,"An Original Low Budget Cult Movie, With Unknown Actors and Actresses and Lots of Great Special Effects",7,15 November 2003,"In a full moon night of a Friday, 13th, the instructors of Camp Crystal Lake are murdered, one by one, in a night of terror. In the end of the story, a convincing explanation clarifies what have happened. This cult movie was very original and spooky in 1980. Placed basically in one location and with unknown young actors and actresses, it was indeed a successful low budget movie, copied many times in other films. Today I have just watched it again, now on a recently released DVD, and it is still good to see. I regret the sequels, since the story is very well resolved in a credible way without supernatural. This way, it is much more terrifying and could have stopped right here. My vote is seven.",Friday the 13th
5,kosmasp,The other Halloween,8,5 November 2020,"What would you do if someone tasked you to write a rip off of a popular movie? In this instance and case we are talking about Halloween! That movie was popular (still is of course, with another installment due in 2021). You try your best, maybe give it a different backstory and most importantly a neat little twist towards the end. Not to mention another rip-off (homage) of a different horror classic too ... just to round things up and all that.So the beginning is quite inspired by Halloween, with giving us something that happened a long time ago ... and has repercussions today. The slasher movie was born .. that's what many believe, which is kinda funny because Cunningham does not feel like that - very humble man. Also a slew of jokes and a spoiler in the movie Scream, which reveals who does the killing here. Not that it is the most important aspect of the movie ... especially considering where the consequent movies went from here.I don't want to get into the details of the few things that actually can be surprising. The rest has become a bit of trope - you have intercourse, you're kind of doomed - another thing taken apart by the movie Scream but also many other spoofs and genuine horror movies. This has some violence in it. In times of torture porn, most may seem tame, but at the time they were anything but. The fact you had someone like Kevin Bacon in this is also quite funny.Effects are quite good to say the least, though only sparsely used. This is not a ""gorefest"" - if that was what you were looking for. It is however the ""Birth"" in a weird sense of one of the better known horror icons worldwide",Friday the 13th
6,gavin6942,This Film Has An Odd Appeal I Cannot Ignore,7,22 April 2007,"Many years after Camp Crystal Lake was shut down due to two counselors being brutally killed, one man decides to reopen it. But the new counselors find that in between drinking, smoking weed and having sex there is someone who is not ready to have the camp be disturbed.Let me lay the awful truth out there: this is a horrible film. Star Betsy Palmer called it a ""piece of (excrement)"" and she is flatly right. The acting is nothing special, the plot is really thin and not very clever. At times -- especially towards the end -- it does not even make sense. What makes slasher horror great is typically the gore. But even that is lacking here -- the gore is pretty weak, with most deaths being off-screen or from cheesy angles.Yet, despite ""Halloween"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" being the better series, and this film's reliance on ""Black Christmas"" for inspiration, I have long considered the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise to be my favorite. I cannot justify it with the poor plots (basically the same thing happens in all eleven of the films) but I just cannot say no to these movies.Which is not to say nothing good came of them. Jason Voorhees is now a well-known pop culture figure, surpassing Michael Myers by a long shot. Kevin Bacon made an appearance here as ""Jack"" before anyone thought ""that boy could be a star"". Sean Cunningham directed, and despite his ""Last House of the Left"" being the better film, and went on to make a living from this series. As did Victor Miller, who was an unheard of writer before this.And perhaps even more than ""Halloween"", this film really launched the slasher craze of the 1980s. The stereotype is a bunch of kids in the woods getting hacked up, not a trio of babysitters being stalked by a station wagon. So, despite its shortcomings, it still deserves credit for everything it inspired.While the gore is minimal, I have to give some credit to Tom Savini. He made due with what he was given, and is even credited as the man who invented Jason Voorhees, which I think makes him somewhat of a hero in the world of horror (besides already being an icon for his amazing makeup and effects). He served as a stunt man and stand-in for the film, too, making this very much his baby.Adrienne King appears, and this is almost her last job in Hollywood due to an obsessed fan. With all respect to Ms. King, this just adds to the element of the film: beautiful young women appears in horror film, only to never star in movies again because of a stalker. This is the stuff legends are made of. (She did return to acting in the 2000s, but primarily in low-budget films.)And last but not least, the first of three appearances by Crazy Ralph, who is by far my favorite character from the series (even more than Jason himself or Tommy Jarvis). His ""doomed"" lines are horror classics now, and they even went so far as to try and get a new Ralphesque character for Part Three (a big mistake, and maybe I will explain this more in my review for that one).Anyway, you are going to want to see this one if you are a horror fan simply for the classic status it now has. But the sad truth is that you should not expect much. As I said, the other major franchises just blow this one away. Even ""Sleepaway Camp"", which was clearly trying to cash in on this film, is debatably the better (or at least more entertaining) film. Although, I think this still beats ""Memorial Valley Massacre"". Those debates are something for another time, though...",Friday the 13th
7,lee_eisenberg,Starring Bing Crosby's son!,5,2 January 2006,"There have now been nine ""Friday the 13th"" sequels - plus ""Freddy vs. Jason"" - so the original one seems pretty sedate. Since you most likely know the plot, I'll just talk about a few aspects. Kevin Bacon appears in an early role (and watch what happens to him). Bing Crosby's son Harry plays one of the counselors. And of course, there's Jason...but there's a surprise there (they identified it in ""Scream"").I still like to think about the fact that Bing Crosby's son starred in this. Just imagine what America's crooner would have thought if he'd known that his son would star in a slasher movie (actually, I've heard a lot of bad things about Bing Crosby, so I wish that that creep could have known). All in all, you can respect this movie for what it is.",Friday the 13th
8,jboothmillard,Friday the 13th,5,8 September 2005,"Obviously influenced by John Carpenter's Halloween, even though Jason wasn't technically in the film, this was the film that started a horror series with a very iconic psycho killer. Basically a group of young counsellors have reopened the cabin at Camp Crystal Lake ready to lead some campers, even knowing there were two murders and a boy named Jason drowned. The counsellors: Ned (Mark Nelson), Jack (young pre-stardom Kevin Bacon), Bill (Harry Crosby), Marcie (Jeannine Taylor), Alice (Adrienne King), and Brenda (Laurie Bartram), soon find the past coming back to haunt them. Soon enough, a vengeful psycho is killing them one by one, in nasty ways, including a spear through the neck under the bed, and an axe through the head/face. Alice is the only survivor, and she meets the woman responsible, the mother of the drowned child Jason, schizophrenic (with his spirit), Mrs. Pamela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer). After killing Mrs. Voorhees by decapitating her, Alice floats away in a boat, and all seems quiet, with the police gathering on the shore, but then all the sudden, the hideous body of Jason (his introduction) jumps up and drags her underneath, but this turns out to be a dream when she wakes in hospital. Also starring Walt Gorney as Crazy Ralph. The gory effects are good enough to keep you watching, the Carrie-like ending (which was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments) does get a reaction, it is quite a good low-budget horror film and start to the long running series of sequels. Worth watching!",Friday the 13th
9,Woodyanders,A solid and influential slice'n'dice outing,8,17 September 2014,"A group of young people who are reopening a rundown summer camp with a dark past are picked off by a mysterious killer. This surprise horror hit works extremely well because it's so straightforward and unpretentious: Director Sean S. Cunningham has no delusions of grandeur and wasn't honestly trying to reinvent the wheel so much as produce a fun and scary night out at the cinema; he wholly succeeds at this particular basic goal by crafting a strong atmosphere of doom, delivering several genuinely creepy moments (the reveal of the corpse in the top bunk while an amorous couple make love in the bottom one is especially jolting), and developing a considerable amount of tension in the harrowing last third. Moreover, Victor Miller's compact script not only has a similar meat and potatoes simplicity to it, but also tweaks the formula a bit by revealing the killer as the bitter and vengeful middle-aged mother Mrs. Voorhees (robustly played with deliciously maniacal gusto by Betsy Palmer) and presenting perky final gal Alice (an appealing portrayal by Adrienne King) as someone who isn't a complete goody-goody two shoes. Of course, Tom Savini's top-notch gore f/x are another significant asset. Moreover, it's fun to see a pre-stardom Kevin Bacon meet a gruesome untimely fate, but only after he gets lucky with a hot babe first (natch). Walt Gorney has a field day with the juicy role of local geezer doomsayer Crazy Ralph. The adorable Robbi Morgan likewise shines in her regrettably brief part as the sweet'n'spunky Annie; it's a clever touch of effective misdirection to set Annie up as a seemingly substantial character and then bump her off right away. Jeannine Taylor looks positively ravishing as the insanely foxy Marcie. The competent cinematography by Barry Abrams makes neat use of prowling POV shots and ably renders the lush sylvan setting. Harry Manfredini's spirited shivery ooga-booga score does the spine-tingling trick. The climax with the hideously malformed Jason popping out of the lake is ingeniously done. Worthy of its classic status.",Friday the 13th
10,ma-cortes,First outing of Jason Vorhees series full of grisly killings and terror,5,4 March 2009,"The story well known starts in 1959 year, an unfortunate accident happens when is drowned a child named Jason Vorhees. Nowadays, a camp-monitors are pursued and killed by an unknown murderer when are attempting re-open the summer camp called Crystal Lake.This classic slasher packs thrills, chills, shocks and terrible deaths. Unsettling gore-feast contains innumerable killings with lots of guts and gore , including impaling,stabbing, beheading, among them.The casting is unknown , exception a young Kevin Bacon as ingenuous counsellor and Betsy Palmer as Jason Vorhees's mother. The creepy murders display a nice special effects and good make-up, courtesy of Tom Savini. Realist and granulated cinematography with utilization subjective camera in the stabbing, that converts the spectator the murderer. Eerie and creaking musical score with frightening leitmotif by Harry Manfredini, saga's usual.The picture is regularly directed by Sean S. Cunninghan(series'habitual producer). Followed by Friday 13 II(by Steve Miner,1981), Friday III(1982 Steve Miner in 3D). The best Friday 13 are: Jason takes Manhattan part VII(1989), Jason X(2002,James Isaac), Freddie Kruger vs. Jason(Ronnie Yu) and the last 'Friday, the 13th'(2008) with Jared Penderecki and Daniella Panbaker.",Friday the 13th
11,BA_Harrison,Cunningham copies Bava and makes a mint.,6,12 February 2007,"Whereas John Carpenter was only 'influenced' by Bob Clark's Black Christmas (1974) when making Halloween (1978), Sean S. Cunningham, director of Friday the 13th was a little more blatant with his movie, lifting both the lakeside setting and the bloody death scenes wholesale from Mario Bava's Bay of Blood (1971). Meanwhile, the admittedly creepy score by Henry Manfredini borrows heavily from Bernard Herrmann's screeching Psycho soundtrack. The result is a gory stalk and slash flick that manages to deliver a few mechanical shocks and several gruesome effects, but spends a lot of its running time treading water between the good bits.Adrienne King plays Alice, one of a group of teenagers (including a young Kevin Bacon) preparing Camp Crystal Lake for its re-opening after many years of closure. Unfortunately, someone is keen for the camp to remain closed and begins to systematically bump off the kids in a variety of inventive ways. It's not long before poor Alice is all on her lonesome, fending off the vicious psycho who needs her corpse to complete the set.With pedestrian direction from Cunningham and so-so acting from the young cast, the film's real star is Tom Savini, who masterminded the movie's memorable gory effects. Juicy highlights include a realistic throat slashing, an axe in the face, and my personal favourite, an arrow through the neck.It is a real shame that Savini's sterling efforts were not matched by the scriptwriter or the director. In order to stop the audience nodding off between kills, we get a rather tame sex scene and several moments where the women wander around in their underwear. Whilst I always appreciate gratuitous female nudity in a horror film, it doesn't make up for the lack of decent scriptwriting and an inability to scare the viewer.Friday the 13th was, however, a huge success and it spawned countless sequels (some of which are actually pretty good) and numerous imitators (mostly not so good). If stalk 'n' slash movies are your thing, then there is no way you should miss out this important entry in the genreeven if it isn't really all that great.",Friday the 13th
12,dbdumonteil,A blueprint for sequels -to-come.,5,8 September 2001,"The first ""Friday' retains a -relative- appeal;it was filmed on location:the forest surrounding the fateful lake provides enough darkness and dangers to satisfy gore afficionados.There was a script,rudimentary admittedly,but a story anyway.The plot was inspired by Agatha Christie's ""and then there were none"",omitting the whodunit side.There is at least two true actors,Kevin Bacon and Betsy Palmer.The suspense is relative too.Past the second third,every time a boy or a girl moves,you are sure that something horrible is going to happen to him/her.But,let's be honest:it's neither Hitchcock norClouzot. What's funny is that almost every sequel will follow exactly the same pattern:1.The adolescents arrive,exchange futile words,sometimes find love and make it.2.The killer goes into action,and ,one by one,does away with all the fellas bar one.3.The survivor -always a girl!!- begins a desperate fight with the monster and wins .(temporary,because you must secure the sequel).Thus,parts 2,3,4,5,6 and 7 are more of the same.Part 8 is a bit more original,moving to urban horizons.What a saga!",Friday the 13th
13,Quinoa1984,Classic horror,6,12 July 2000,"Not exactly a masterpiece, but not a waste of time either.  This film is basically a starters set for the film-buffs who start watching horror films. Premise- a killer is after a bunch of kids at a camp many years after a tragedy to a kid named Jason Voorhees.  Some good killer scenes (and Betsy Palmer is very good in this film) but not exactly a great horror film. Classic entertainment anyway.  A-",Friday the 13th
14,BandSAboutMovies,One heck of a starting point,7,13 April 2018,"After the success of John Carpenter's Halloween, every studio wanted a piece of the horror pie, which to this point had been exploitation fodder. Paramount Pictures was first. Sure, critics salvaged the film, but after $40 million in profit, no one really cared.Produced and directed by Sean S. Cunningham (Last House on the Left), this movie was envisioned as a roller coaster ride. The script came from Victor Miller, a soap opera scribe. And spoilers - but this movie doesn't even really have Jason in it!The movie starts in the summer of 1958 at Camp Crystal Lake, where two counselors sneak off and have sex before being killed. This sets up one of the many rules of slasher films: never screw in the woods.The camp closes for 21 years, but on Friday, June 13, 1979, that's all about to change. That said, no one in the town wants it to happen. When Annie Phillips arrives in town, everyone treats her strangely or acts like Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney, who shows up in the next film and was the narrorator for Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood). She lasts for about five minutes, as she gets killed after her third hitchhike of the day. I'd say this is more of a warning against hitching in the late 1970's than I would serial killers in the woods.The other counselors - Jack (Kevin Bacon!), Ned, Bill (Harry Crosby III, son of Bing), Marcie, Alice and Brenda (Laurie Bartram, The House of Seven Corpses) - and owner Steve Christy all show up to get the camp ready. This is where you'll notice just how different fashion is. Becca and I have seen this live several times in a theater now and everyone laughs as soon as Steve shows up in his short shorts and bandana.Ned is killed pretty quickly, then Jack is killed with an arrow and Marcie takes an axe to the face. Brenda is murdered as she responds to the voice of a child. Steve gets killed on the way to camp. Before you know it, Alice and Bill are the only ones left, but Bill lasts pretty much seconds. Then we have another future slasher trope: every body is discovered, hung like trophies.Now, we have our Final Girl: Alice, who ends up meeting Mrs. Vorhees, who tells the tale of how her son Jason drowned and the horrible counselors who allowed it to happen. Much like the giallo/pre-slasher film Torso, the movie now focuses on the battle between Alice and the real killer. Alice ends up beheading her and sleeping in a canoe. As the police arrive, she has a dream that Jason rises from the water to kill her. This scene wasn't in the script, but speical effects king Tom Savini thought a Carrie-like ending would be more powerful. Another way that the film pays sort of homage to Italian filmmaking is in the snake scene. It was another Savini idea after an experience he had in his own cabin during filming. The snake in the scene? Totally real, including its on-screen death - someone alert Bruno Mattei!Some trivia: the film was shot just outside Lou Reed's farm. The rock star performed for the cast and even hung out with them! Sweet Jason?To me, the film works because of how great Betsy Palmer is as Jason's mom. It's a fine film, but nowhere near the excesses that the series would grow into. This was also the start of critics really hating on slasher films. Gene Siskel was so upset about Betsy Palmer being in the film that he published her address in his column and encouraged people to write her and protest. Of course, he published the wrong address.",Friday the 13th
15,Coventry,A slasher-star is born !!,5,30 October 2003,"Friday the 13th must be one of the biggest mysteries in cinema. Although it's a long way from being a good movie, its success and influence is unnameable ( and even unbelievable ). Don't get me wrong...I'm not at all saying that Friday the 13th is a terrible film or not even worth a watch but - let's face it - the plot idea is pretty dumb, the acting and directing are far below average and they haven't fully used the options of setting and location they had. The make-up effects ( by the master Tom Savini himself ) are excellent, but that alone isn't really enough to create a legendary horror movie in my opinion. Some of the later sequels ( Episode 6 : Jason Lives is the perfect example ) and even a few of the numberless rip-offs are superior to the production.
I suppose the story is pretty much known by everyone know and I even think the identity of the ""mysterious killer"" of this episode isn't that much of a mystery anymore. Anyway, in case you don't know it, I won't spoil the fun so see for yourself. Although my thoughts on it aren't that high, I do think it's must-see stuff for horror fans. Without any shame, I even admit that Friday the 13th and ALL its sequels are a guilty pleasure of mine. I'll never reckon them as good - or even decent - efforts in the genre, but I'm always up for a little bit of brainless gore slashing. And that's what these series are made for...pure entertainment !! So, in a way, they succeeded after all. They never try to give a thoughtful message to the viewer or something. There are just dumb-looking teenagers being slaughtered...the more the merrier.Favorite ""rewind""-scene : A young and horny Kevin Bacon being brutally killed in one of his first memorable roles.",Friday the 13th

18,Theo Robertson,Has A Nostalgia Value But Not Much Else,5,22 March 2004,"I got the DVD of FRIDAY THE 13TH from my sister as a christmas present but didn`t get round to watching until today , don`t ask me why I delayed seeing it for so long but I just did . It`s a movie I can remember fairly well the first time I saw it from over 20 years ago but since them I`ve become totally turned off by teenagers getting chopped up by a maniac with an axe movies . It`s almost impossible to believe it was HALLOWEEN and this movie that introduced the slasher pic to cinema audiences . These movies have a lot to answer for After seeing it again after all these years the thing to strike me was how slow everything is . For great chunks of the running time very little happens to drive the thread bare plot forward . Of course if the plot revolves around teenagers getting bumped off one by one then you`re going to have a problem filling the movie with compelling scenes and perhaps the only interest in the early part is the scene transferred to modern day America from those old Hammer horror movies where the girl enters the diner and asks for directions . I honestly thought someone was going to say "" Strangers ? We don`t get many strangers here "" . There are a couple of other things worth noting like an early screen appearence by Kevin Bacon , the fact Jason is NOT the murderer in this movie and the false ending which is a classic movie moment but FRIDAY THE 13TH is populated by characters doing very very little and it seems somewhat laughable now that this was a very notorious horror film in its day something myself and my peer group wanted to get our hands on via video . Even more laughable is that someone thought it would be a great idea to start a franchise from this movie Anyway thanks for the DVD Michelle",Friday the 13th
19,Hey_Sweden,"""You see, Jason was my son...and today is his birthday.""",7,13 January 2012,"The extremely successful early slasher that, along with ""Halloween"" (1978), served to create a template for all that followed, ""Friday the 13th"" can be considered one of the essentials of its genre. Its appeal lies in the very simplicity of the formula, the atmosphere and eeriness inherent to its woodsy setting, Harry Manfredini's instantly identifiable ""ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma"" music score, and the memorable makeup effects by Tom Savini, who got boosted to ""star"" status as a result of his work on this movie.It's popular enough to not really need a rehash of the basic story, but for the uninitiated, it deals with a lovely summer camp named Crystal Lake that has actually had quite an unsavoury history throughout the years - fires, bad water, etc. - that started with the drowning of a boy back in the 1950's. Now, a small group of would be counsellors works at getting the place ready for business once again, but they will soon be stalked and slaughtered by the long unseen, demented perpetrator.There are so many things to enjoy with ""Friday the 13th"", enough that it can be seen as true comfort cinema, the kind of thing we know so well and on which we can always rely for some undeniably effective entertainment. Of course, producer / director Sean S. Cunningham and company never intended for this to become the pop culture phenomenon that it is today, merely a potboiler that they hoped would be enough of a hit to keep them financially secure. But the movie took off in a way none of them could have anticipated. To date we've seen nine sequels (10 if you count the crossover flick ""Freddy vs. Jason"") and one sort-of remake, and a multitude of imitative horror flicks over the years.The acting is basically all it needs to be: serviceable, with the exception of its star attraction, sweet faced veteran Betsy Palmer, who does a delightful job of just tearing into the scenery with a wonderfully loony performance. Cast member Kevin Bacon may have become a star within the next few years, but here he's merely one actor in a likable, attractive young ensemble. Hilarious bits are played by Walt Gorney, as the aptly named Crazy Ralph, and Ron Millkie, as the way too serious Officer Dorf.Gory highlights include murder by axe, machete, and arrow, and a now legendary decapitation. The location work is excellent, and the pacing quite effective, with kills placed at fairly frequent intervals; the big finish includes a highly amusing fight scene performed by the cast members themselves.All of this adds up to a bona fide horror classic that continues to satisfy and attract new fans over 30 years later.Seven out of 10.",Friday the 13th
20,Doylenf,Camp Crystal Lake...this is where the body count started...,5,10 October 2006,"Teen fans and adults with arrested development turned this slasher flick into such a monumental success that there were countless sequels, each one sicker, not slicker, than the one before. At least here, at the start, the plot made some sense and the killings actually seemed to be motivated by a character looking to avenge someone. Can't say more without giving the whole plot away for those still in the dark about who-dun-it.Out of the cast, only two names are even familiar to me--BETSY PALMER, mother of a slain student, and KEVIN BACON as a camp counselor in an early role. Both of them meet a grisly fate.It's the film that introduced Jason to the world--for better or worse--and the acting is strictly amateur night stuff. Even TV star Betsy Palmer has trouble sounding convincing with lines that have you wondering how she kept a straight face. Amusing to see Kevin Bacon in a rather thankless role as a counselor who should have known better.Still, it's better than some of the disgusting sequels that followed, each one worse than the one before. If gore is your thing, you won't be disappointed in the brutal killings here.",Friday the 13th
21,preppy-3,A classic of its type,7,19 February 2003,"The plot is well-known by now--a bunch of attractive 20 somethings are slaughtered at a summer camp by the possessed mother of a little boy (Jason) who died there years ago.This was a huge hit with teenagers in 1980 and spun the slasher film craze (which started with ""Halloween"" in 1978) into orbit.  It's not exactly a great film (the plot is pretty dumb), but it's a hundred times better than its sequels and clones and, in a way, is a true classic of the horror genre.The acting isn't half bad--there's a pre-stardom Kevin Bacon and good performances by Adrienne King, Harry Crosby (who won't even discuss the film nowadays) and Betsy Palmer (who called the script ""a piece of s***"").  The setting itself is beautiful (I believe it was shot in the NY-NJ area) and there's some good direction by Sean Cunningham.  There's the now infamous music (which I find really scary) and the murders are gory and very well-executed (sorry!).  The effects are uncomfortably realistic--I vividly remember a large portion of the audience walking out back in 1980 when a woman gets an axe in her face.  The script is not too bad and this movie is nowhere near as sexist as later slashers.  In this film an equal number of women AND men are killed--in later films it was all women.  And the women in this film are intelligent, attractive and not just screaming bimbos.  Also unlike later slashers which had needless sex scenes, this movie only has one and it's fairly tasteful with only a few flashes of nudity.  The climatic fight between Palmer and King is exciting and still pretty strong stuff and Jason's final jump out of the water still packs a jolt. 
So, a good gory horror film.  A must see for horror fans.  Just don't expect ""Citizen Kane"".",Friday the 13th
22,poolandrews,Classic slasher.,8,18 August 2007,"Friday the 13th starts at Camp Crystal Lake 1958 where two young counsellors are brutally murdered... Jump forward to Friday June 13th, Present Day where Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer) is trying to reopen Camp Crystal & together with some young counsellors is fixing the place up & getting it ready for it's first guests since 1958 when it was closed, the cook Annie (Robbi Morgan) is late & has hitched a lift in a jeep but the driver stops & slashes her throat with a knife. With Annie dead the homicidal maniac decides to turn their attention to the rest of the young counsellors & proceeds to kill them one-by-one...Produced & directed by Sean S. Cunningham this is the one original slasher that spawned no less than 10 sequels to date & countless imitators, even more than John Carpenter's suspenseful Halloween (1978) I consider Friday the 13th as the original slasher that pretty much kick started this popular sub-genre. The script by Victor Miller & an uncredited Ron Kurz while Tom Savini came up with the ending is perhaps the purest slasher film ever made, it has the teenage cast, it has a mad killer, it has a steady stream of gory deaths, it has sporadic & somewhat unnecessary bouts of nudity, it has a lone female heroine & takes place in one single isolated location. It's a formula which would be copied many, many times since over the years & while there have been gorier slashers like say The Burning (1981) & The Prowler (1981) (both with gory effects by Tom Savini) & better made ones like the recent Scream (1996) & I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) I just think Friday the 13th is so well balanced between gore, a decent pace, reasonable character's who aren't annoying, a certain amount of mystery surrounding the killer although everyone knows the story by now & that 80's horror film feel which I've always liked. The story as it is isn't anything to write home about as it's just a collection of gory set-piece murders but in that respect it's good at what it sets out to do & I throughly liked it & consider it a stonewall classic & I don't use the word classic that often.Director Cunningham does a good job here, for some reason the murders get less gory as the film goes on, the opening few are pretty graphic with slashed throats & arrows through throats but by the end the last few happen off screen & we just get to see the dead corpses. There's a nice atmosphere about Friday the 13th & I love a horror film with a good thunderstorm, there are some scary moments & a bit of tension as well along with that unmistakable sleazy 80's horror film feel & it has great music as well. There are some good gore effects by Tom Savini, a cool slashed throat, an arrow through someones throat, stabbings, impalings, an axe in the face & a graphic decapitation at the end. There is one scene I felt was rather unnecessary though when a snake is chopped in half with a machete & it's obvious that a real snake was used so animal lovers beware. There's some sex & nudity as well although not too much.With a supposed budget of about $700,000 Friday the 13th was a massive hit & went on to make $30,000,000 although the IMDb claims it made over $5,000,000 on it's opening theatrical weekend which normally I wouldn't have questioned but it says it only opened on one screen & I can't see $5,000,000 worth of business going through one screen over one weekend, if it did it must have been a pretty big screen & they must have played it back-to-back without any breaks! It's well made if not spectacular & that's all you can ask for I suppose. The acting is fine, again it's not brilliant but it's alright with Kevin Bacon making an early appearance.Friday the 13th is the archetypal slasher, the one that set all the rules which it's imitators would follow & is a fine example which is why it was so successful I suppose, I liked it a lot but then I must admit I do like gory slashers anyway even if they are a somewhat limited sub-genre. Just don't expect anything deep or meaningful which I don't think anyone will anyway.",Friday the 13th
23,utgard14,"""Don't let her get away, Mommy! Don't let her live!""",7,9 April 2014,"Camp Crystal Lake is being reopened two decades after the drowning death of a boy named Jason Voorhees. The camp counselors gather to prepare for the opening. Someone isn't a fan and starts killing them off one by one. The first of arguably the best slasher series from the '80s, Friday the 13th. This one is notable for not actually featuring Jason Voorhees as the killer, as well as the surprise ending. The formula is pretty simple, which has led to the series often being slammed by critics and film snobs. But it's not art, it's entertainment. Nothing wrong with that.I really loved the rural New Jersey filming locations. Not just the camp but the small town nearby and the roads surrounding. Adds to the atmosphere of the movie, which it has in spades. This is probably the best movie of the series, although parts 4 and 6 are personal favorites of mine I revisit more than this one. The cast is good for this kind of movie, with Betsy Palmer giving the standout performance. Adrienne King is a little green but likable and easy to root for. Also an early role for Kevin Bacon. Walt Gorney is memorable as Crazy Ralph. Good direction, memorable score, and excellent locations. A really fun movie that I think even people who aren't die-hard horror fans can enjoy.",Friday the 13th

One of the rules of slasher films, I imagine.Young Kevin Bacon gets lucky with Marcie (Jeannine Taylor), but it comes at a high price. By now, they are dropping like flies.It all ends with Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees, and Adrienne King as Alice in a final battle to the death.And then, a setup for a sequel.",Friday the 13th
25,zardoz-13,One Bad Mother Gone Amok!,8,16 February 2009,"Sean S. Cunningham's surprise shocker ""Friday the 13th"" emerged as the second major slasher after John Carpenter's seminal ""Halloween"" with Jamie Lee Curtis. Like ""Halloween,"" the success of ""Friday the 13th"" spawned a franchise that has been running ad nauseam since 1980. Unquestionably, ""Friday the 13th"" surpasses the other eight original sequels, including the glossy 2009 remake. The original lacks the humor of ""Jason X"" (2002) where the villain was cryogenically frozen, but the first ""Friday"" remains the best. What sets it apart from the sequels is its startling eleventh hour twist. ""Friday the 13th"" ranks as an above-average chiller precisely for its element of mystery, Clearly, Brian De Palma's ""Carrie"" influenced the ending. The offbeat casting of sweet Betsy Palmer as the evil Mrs. Voorhees constitutes Cunningham's chief stroke of genius. The youthful cast of camp counselors is unexceptional but adequate, especially when you realize the weather was not exactly amenable to them in their lightweight apparel. ""Friday the 13th"" was set during the summer, but the production occurred in the fall with chilly temperatures, so those kids in bathing suits must have been freezing. The highlight of the horror is make-up artist Tom Savini's work. Some effects appear rather obvious now, like the arrow through Bacon's neck, but it was strong stuff when this movie came out. Composer Harry Manfredini's shrieking score enhances the uneasy atmosphere, and Bernard Herrman's music from Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" unmistakably inspired Manfredini. Amazingly, there really isn't that much gore.""Friday the 13th"" opens on a dark night in 1958 at Camp Crystal Lake, a rural summer camp for kids where parents entrust their children to teenage counselors. Male and female counselors leave a sing-a-long party and sneak off to another upstairs room where they can have some privacy. An intruder surprises them as they are getting intimate. They scramble to dress themselves, and the intruder (we see everything from the intruder's perspective) stabs the young man, and he lurches with blood on his stomach to fall down. The camera freezes on the screaming girl as she tries to escape but fails. The story switches to the here and now and everything from there occurs in real time for the most part. In other words, ""Friday the 13th"" preserves the unities of time, place, and action.The first person that we meet during the contemporary part of ""Friday the 13th"" is cute little Annie (Robbi Morgan of ""Me, Natalie"") who is hitchhiking her way to Camp Crystal Lake. She enters the nearest town and inquires about directions and receives some strange looks. A truck driver (Rex Everhart of ""Superman"") agrees to take her to the crossroads near Camp Crystal Lake. Before they drive off, Annie meets the local loon Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney of ""Trading Places"") who warns Annie. Later, Crazy Ralph warns Annie about Camp Blood. Annie understands none of this talk. During the ride, the truck driver explains that Camp Crystal Lake is jinxed. Annie is on her way there to cook for the counselors and kids. Of course, sweet little Annie never reaches Camp Crystal Lake, because she hitches another ride with the wrong person in a jeep and that individual, whom we never catch a glimpse of, kills her.Meanwhile, Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer of ""American Desi"") is struggling to finish all the repairs to Camp Crystal Lake before the inner-city kids show up. Helping Steve is Alice Hardy (Adrienne King of ""Saturday Night Fever""). Alice is apparently Steve's girlfriend, but their relationship is not good because Alice has thoughts about leaving. Steve convinces her to stick around a little longer. About that time, more camp counselors arrive. Future ""Footloose"" star Kevin Bacon plays one of the counselors. Cunningham stages several memorable death scenes in ""Friday the 13th"" with Tom Savini. Bacon has one of the best. While he is sprawled on a bunk smoking a joint, an arrow erupts from his throat and he bleeds to death. Another guy is impaled on arrows and pinned to a door, and a girl takes an ax in the face.Anyway, Steve leaves for town to pick up some supplies, and the counselors frolic on the lake in their swim trunks. An interesting scene transpires when one of them appears to be drowning and the counselors all pitch in and pull the guy out of the water before they realize that he has been bluffing. This scene is interesting because we learn later that young Jason Voorhees died at Camp Crystal Lake because the counselors were engaging in illicit sex and not paying attention to their charges.Eventually, night falls and rain begins to pour. The counselors are picked off one-by-one by a mysterious assailant. Steve's jeep bogs down and a cop has to pick him up and then deposit him to rush off to an accident. As he is entering Camp Crystal Lake, somebody with a blinding flashlight attacks and kills Steve. The murderous assailant never takes on more than one person at a time. With twenty minutes left to go, Alice finds herself locked into mortal combat with the killer who has been stabbing and hacking away at her friends. They engage in a protracted fight and Alice whacks her head off, climbs into canoe and drifts out to the middle of the lake where she spends the night until the police arrive in the morning.Finally, on the commentary track of the unrated ""Friday the 13th, Cunningham cites the source of horror as bad things happening to good people for no apparent reason. Furthermore, he doesn't equate sexual promiscuity with death. He does equate sexual repression with murder, however, in the case of the unhinged Mrs. Voorhees. Meanwhile, scenarist Victor Miller says the iconoclastic thing about ""Friday the 13th is taking mom and apple pie and standing them on their head.",Friday the 13th
26,Boba_Fett1138,A classic genre movie that has never even really been considered a true great movie.,7,22 October 2009,"Unlike ""A Nigthmare on Elm Street"" and ""Halloween"" this movie has never truly been considered a brilliant movie within its genre but yet it's up there with these two movies as the most genre defining and classic movies.It's of course not that ""Friday the 13th"" is a bad movie, it's just also one that is being quite standard and formulaic with as a difference that the execution of it all is done just a bit better and more effective than other genre attempts from the same period. In that regard it's certainly true that ""Friday the 13th"" was a genre defining movie, that set the new standards for later movies.The movie has everything in it that you can expect from a genre movie. Basically all the movie is about a bunch of youngster being killed off one by one at an abandoned campsite. Out of all the genre movies featuring a similar type of concept, this movie really doesn't have the best story but it does have one of the best approaches. It's being kept a good secret who is the killer for a long time and also what his/her motivations are exactly. It makes the movie eerie and suspenseful and also the twists in the story work out nicely for the movie because it isn't really what you would normally expect.It does have a couple of great moments in it and also the ending is quite memorable. Guess the movie could had been a bit more bloody and gorier but that is not what the movie is trying to achieve. It tries to shock the viewer more with its moments, rather than lots of blood and brutal killings.A good genre defining movie from the early '80's.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Friday the 13th

28,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,And you thought you were just being superstitious about the calendar,7,16 January 2011,"In 1958, two people are killed at camp Chrystal Lake(mostly because Halloween made a profit two years prior... this is pretty much that with a bigger body count and a different ""where you are vulnerable when you're young"" setting). They were both counsellors, and 22 years later, it's reopened and we meet a new group of such, consisting of guys who are willing to go shirtless(for the sake of the girls in the audience... though it's ruined by the dorky stuff they're wearing) and women who go along with getting half-, or fully, naked. They're stalked(...see what I mean?) by a POV and the score(...I'm going to stop pointing out these similarities). The latter is at times eerie(the infamous echo is present, as one of the only iconic aspects that are here from the beginning of the franchise). This is not good in any sense of the word from a technical standpoint. Filming and editing are average at best. The gore and make-up FX are nice(and at times creative and memorable... note that they aren't plentiful, you don't see much or for long), but they haven't aged all that well(still, you can tell Savini put effort into it, and it came out well). Neither did the slang(""an American original""? Is that even an insult?), and the dialog is meh. The attempts at humor are pitiful. Acting is basically all over the top. This does try to build up and be suspenseful. The pacing is off. They didn't really know what they were doing here, but they did want to do something well-done, and that really counts for something. This gets the job done, and one can understand why the sub-genre took off. You find yourself going ""no, don't go in there"" and thinking the killer will emerge suddenly from a dark space. While there are jumpscares that do not pay off, it can also really work. The biggest problem is that we aren't invested in these characters(only one of them is obnoxious, the rest you just don't remember), and it doesn't last the full nearly 90 minutes. There is a little sexuality and nudity in this. The DVD comes with a commentary track(put together by interviews with the various crew and cast... it's interesting and provides some good anecdotes, fun, history and background), a 22 minute documentary(that I will review on its own page here on the site), and a lousy theatrical trailer. I recommend this to forgiving fans of slasher flicks. 7/10",Friday the 13th
29,kevinolzak,Seen on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater only in 1982,4,14 January 2021,"1980's ""Friday the 13th"" was an independent effort from Sean S. Cunningham, whose track record in horror at the time was limited to producing Wes Craven's seminal symphony of violence, 1972's ""The Last House on the Left,"" trying his hand at family frolics like ""Here Come the Tigers"" and ""Manny's Orphans"" before using the same screenwriter, Victor Miller, to come up with the barest outline (called ""A Long Night at Camp Blood"") for an 'emotional roller coaster' in hopes for a surefire success. A double murder at Camp Crystal Lake in 1958 preceded a series of setbacks for each attempt to reopen the property, earning it the nickname 'Camp Blood' for its history of death. The present day finds a new sponsor hiring six young counselors to help with the task of putting all the pieces together for another summer of hope, a bunch referred to as 'babes in the woods' without any experience of roughing it in this area (an active and still functioning summer camp in New Jersey). The late arrival is the hitchhiking cook, accepting one wrong ride from a stranger who proceeds to literally 'stalk and slash,' a simple slit of the throat drawing first blood. The group go about their tasks when not relaxing with a morning swim, until nightfall brings down a reign of terror that reduces the cast members to only a single survivor to do battle with the revealed maniac, a climactic siege clearly aping ""Halloween"" with its plucky heroine warding off a seemingly unstoppable adversary, only here it merely comes off as protracted and decidedly lacking in suspense as audiences were inspired to talk back at the screen for every stupid maneuver. With sketchy characters played by a no name cast set up only as sitting ducks, the only possible way this witless mess of cliches could become a hit was in staging each death with great care, the sole reason for the picture's existence. With Pittsburgh's own Tom Savini at the helm, shortly after making his name on George A. Romero's sequel ""Dawn of the Dead,"" everything fell into place as his Vietnam experience in combat photography allowed him to realistically use flesh colored appliances and stage blood to produce what Paramount's Michael Eisner admitted were 'some of the most highly creative screen killings' he had ever seen (Savini was able to cope with the horrors of war through his camera lens, to imagine how he could achieve such results artificially). With the opening third plodding through routine carpentry duties, the second provides all the gore, the third going off the rails with the revelation of a hilarious middle aged killer whose displays of grief are intended to be creepy but prove laughable (merely a simple minded inversion of Hitchcock's ""Psycho""). It was important for ""Halloween"" to never explain the motives or indestructible nature of the masked murderer (one child's description of The Boogey Man would suffice), and the heroine's discovery of his dead victims in strategic hiding places is logically performed in one spot, whereas here the bodies pop up no matter where she goes, exactly the 'roller coaster' promised by Cunningham at the expense of logic; essentially stripping away all the complexities of Italian Giallo, the audience is reduced to urging on each death to see what the filmmakers come up with next. Tom Savini's next project particularly glorified the culprit's twisted motivations, William Lustig's ""Maniac,"" with its admittedly bravura depiction of a man's head (a character played by Savini himself) blown off by a shotgun, while in less than a year this dumbing down of American culture had already grown wearily routine in titles like ""New Year's Evil,"" ""Final Exam,"" ""The Burning,"" ""The Prowler,"" ""Graduation Day,"" and the inevitable sequel.",Friday the 13th

I truly hope there is no real Crystal Lake because there's no way they could've survived the negative publicity from the Friday the 13ths.Hope, New Jersey is home to the notorious Crystal Lake, or it's the closest known town. An ambitious guy by the name of Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer) is trying to revitalize the derelict Camp Crystal Lake to make it open to youth again. He hires six teens/young adults to help him out.

That is until the killer is revealed at the end.Friday the 13th was the next step in horror movie genre evolution. Some movies flirted with the slasher idea but there was only so much they could do. Going back to Psycho there was only so much that effects creators and make up artists could do to show someone getting butchered. Friday the 13th stepped the game up.

31,evanston_dad,When Slasher Films Were Innocent,1,14 March 2006,"How did this movie ever get the reputation as a horror classic? I've been re-watching the ""Friday the 13th"" series recently and have been struck by how awfully incompetent they are as films. This first installment I guess has the advantage of being novel, though not really, since it doesn't use any formula conventions that ""Halloween"" didn't use two years earlier. And the actual film making technique in ""Halloween"" makes it seem like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" compared to this.Still, there is something nostalgically satisfying about these movies. Seeing dopey teenagers get axed in the face and knifed through the throat brings a little glow to my heart. This was made at a time when slasher movies had a kind of innocence that horror movies now have lost. These films were nasty at the time, but they're absolutely quaint when compared to the nasty cinema coming out now in the same genre, a sad testament to just how jaded we've become.As far as rating this particular movie, not all of the movies in the series are as bad as this one, but I can't bring myself to give the original anything other than a big fat F.Grade: F",Friday the 13th

He also hires several new counselors who arrive a week prior to its reopening. Unfortunately, no sooner do they get there then the killings start up once again. Now, rather than reveal any more of this film and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is one of the best slasher movies ever produced. It has good suspense all the way through with the killer remaining a mystery up until the very end as well. The special effects are also quite good. Likewise, there are a couple of attractive females present with ""Laurie Bartram"" (as ""Brenda"") being my personal favorite. Additionally, as a further testimony to its success at the box office it generated a plethora of sequels for years afterward.

Cunningham / Cast: Adrienne King, Betsy Palmer, Harry Crosby, Laurie Bartram, Walt Gorney: Graphic slasher film about superstition. Camp Crystal Lake is reopening after several years rumoring a curse due to murders and a boy drowning. One by one the counsellors are murdered in graphic detail until one remains. Setup is effective but structure is sometimes dull and given to bad dialogue. The counsellors indulge in sex as well as strip monopoly before descending to more hack and slash. Directed by Sean S. Cunningham who creates suspense using atmosphere. This is a far cry from his failed Bad News Bears imitating Here Come the Tigers. Strong performance by Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees who doesn't factor in until the effective third act but she steals her scenes in her expression of motherly madness. Adrienne King makes for a decent heroine who acts as a vessel for past information before a shocking scene on the lake. The rest of the cast are pretty much the standard dull counsellors who have sex and die in graphic matter. Some of the victims, including Harry Crosby and Laurie Bartram are given effective send off murders through built up suspense. Walt Gorney could have used another scene or two as the amusing Crazy Ralph whose drunken stance warns them that they're doomed.

The biggest figure working here is the absolutely simple and streamlined concept here, which comes from the rather stylistic approach here. This one is basically built around the absolutely thrilling suspense scenes here, where this one really manages to get numerous stalking scenes throughout here, from the opening stalking at the camp flashback to the real stalking here of the foot- chase through the woods following on from the thrilling car-hostage speeding through the countryside, the chilling encounter in the bathroom as a startling noise alerts a clueless preening victim which causes the extensive checking before the final startling attack makes for a wholly enjoyable sequence along with the graphic death and the extremely tense scenes searching in the rain for a lost voice only to have the tables turned into a tense suspense scene here all come off incredibly well here at generating a far creepier atmosphere than expected here based on the woodlands being utilized very well here. These here are as great as they are by taking advantage of the isolation found there driven along by the film's absolutely crazy rainstorm, which comes into grand play here with the final chase through camp against the killer where the hiding and searching comes nicely with the brawling and chasing that makes for a decent enough time here. Along with the fun manner of using the POV camera to hide the killers' identity here which is a true who-done-it murder mystery, this one has plenty of suspense here to go along with the utterly brutal and graphic kills here. This one has a lot of brutality and gore here and is dished out quite nicely despite the really aggravating trend of showing the male deaths in graphic shocks with the females being stalked in suspenseful manners. Still, that one really doesn't hold this one back since it isn't really noticed at all during the film and brings the positives along here to hold up over the film's few flaws. The main one here is the sheer stupidity an nonsensical behavior throughout here, from purposefully locking themselves into a cabin with a vicious snake, sneaking off for private time during a raging thunderstorm and purposefully removing barricades and protection here to check out someone that may well be the maniacal killer plaguing them, which is only a sample of the kind of moronic behavior here that runs rampant in here which comes quite aggravating here. Though there are a few instances here where the low-budget shines through in obvious and painful methods here, but it's not nearly enough to hold this one down from the other positives.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Adult Language, Brief Nudity, a mild Sex Scene, and drug use.",Friday the 13th

36,FlashCallahan,You never know where Crazy Ralph will pop up.....,8,27 July 2013,"In 1957, at Camp Crystal Lake, a young boy, Jason Voorhees drowned. As the years go by, two camp counsellors are murdered. Fires and bad water thwarted the camp's reopening. In 1979, Camp Crystal Lake relaunches with the help of a few new counsellors. Ignoring the warnings from good old Crazy Ralph, popping up everywhere, the murders start again while a mysterious stalker prowls the area. Even though the film is in my opinion the epitome of eighties slasher movies and the beginning of one of the best horror franchises ever, its not the most fun movie to watch from the series, unless your one of the lucky ones who saw the movies in chronological order.Its a shame if you saw Scream before this, because there is a major plot spoiler in the opening scene.Its a simple set up that has been homaged, ripped off, and copied several times, especially in the eighties with the likes of The Burning, Sleepaway Camp etc, but this has never been bettered.But what makes it hold up, is the actual plot and narrative, and its very sinister, even by today's standards. And the killers revelation and their rationale, is totally brilliant.The sequels after part two were very tongue in cheek and virtually threw the sinister parts away, but they were and are still, a lot more fun for a group to watch.The cast are great and add to the nuance, and even 33 years later, its still one of the best stalk and slash movies ever made.",Friday the 13th
37,movieman_kev,Still a classic,8,11 January 2005,"A group of camp counselors, a young Kevin Bacon among them, are busy trying to re-open Camp Crystal Lake years after multiple murders shut it down, despite the ravings of Crazy Ralph. They are dispatched one by one by an unseen killer. This IS a classic and always will be. Don't get me wrong as it's not perfect. But it's far from ""merely a Halloween"" clone which some people say. The original Halloween is a perfect classic, but let this film stand on it's own legs as it has every right to. Although I'm saddened about how shoddily Paramount seemed to put out their recent box set. Hell when New Line acquired the rights to the series, yes their Jason films suck, but at least they do right by the fans DVD-wise.Paramount could have done a great service to us by looking back at New Lin's Nightmare on Elm Street box set.

38,Wuchakk,The beginning of the most successful slasher franchise,8,24 July 2014,"Released in May, 1980, ""Friday the 13th"" was produced in the wake of the success of 1978's ""Halloween"" and also shares elements of 1976' ""Carrie."" The story revolves around a cursed summer vacation spot, Camp Crystal Lake, New Jersey, and the slayings of young camp counselors. Critics slammed the film and I'm not sure why since it's in the same league as the acclaimed ""Carrie"" and ""Halloween."" Regardless, it was hugely popular at the box office, making far more than any of the sequels until ""Freddy vs. Jason"" in 2003. As of this writing there are 12 movies in the franchise and another in the works, making it the most successful slasher series and one of the most successful franchises of any genre.I'm not a gorehound at all and only occasionally watch slasher flicks, but I'm a huge fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. Why? It has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" on TV one night. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm that old); the presence of a lunatic unstoppable killer, who becomes more and more of a hideous monster, just adds an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end.Speaking of the women, this first movie is highlighted by Annie (Robbi Morgan), Alice (Adrienne King) and Marcie (Jeannine Taylor) with honorable mention to Brenda and Claudette, the latter from the opening 1958 segment. As far as dudes go, a youthful Kevin Bacon is on hand as one of the counselors.As for the filming locations, this one was shot in the remote townships of Hardwick, Blairstown & Hope, New Jersey. It's interesting how none of the films were shot at the same location even though, typically, the location in the story is Camp Crystal Lake and that general vicinity. Other locations include Connecticut (II & IX), California (III, IV, V), Georgia (VI), Alabama (VII), British Columbia (VIII & XI), New York City (VIII), Toronto (X & XI) and Texas (XII).It's the camp-like settings of most of the franchise and the unstoppable monster that is Jason Voorhees (and the demonic thing that possesses him, his mother and others, as disclosed in 1993's ""Jason Goes to Hell"") that especially sets ""Friday the 13th"" apart from similar franchises.Concerning the tone, the first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the franchise introduced a campy element in Part III, which rears its head in several entries (V, VI, IX and X) until the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway. Speaking of which, the only thing questionable about this first film, as far as realism goes, is how the killer is able to throw an adult corpse through a window or hang a body from a door, etc. But I suppose these things can be attributed to the powerful psycho Voorhees gene (or the hellish entity that possesses them).Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some slightly chilling aspects, some of the others as well, I guess, but, with the exception of the 2009 reboot, I don't usually find these movies particularly scary. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always entertaining, but not scary (although there are numerous jump-scares, of course). In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.I give ""Friday the 13th"" a high rating because it IS an effective film in the oft-maligned slasher/horror genre, not to mention it's iconic and kicked-off this amazingly successful franchise. No genre is beyond redemption if done right; and that's the case here.The film runs 95 minutes.GRADE: A-",Friday the 13th
39,Sylviastel,Today is Friday the Thirteenth!,8,13 October 2006,"This film was low budget with cast members such as Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees and an unknown young actor named Kevin Bacon. The plot is simple. A bunch of young adults go to the campsite to set up a summer camp. They filmed this in Blairstown, New Jersey which is on the border of Pennsylvania and still pretty much country and rural rather than urban or suburban. Anyway, this film was a low budget much like Halloween. It all takes place there. It's funny and will scare you silly. The cast is decent. The scenery is picturesque and the story is interesting enough to keep you watching. You hope that they always air this film on Friday the Thirteenth which is today and in October. Only 18 days before Halloween, another frightening holiday, anyway, I think the film is worth watching if you are into the horror stuff. Even now, I have seen this film several times and the sequels never could compare to the original. It's really Betsy Palmer's film. She's best known for her role as Mrs. Voorhees still to this day.",Friday the 13th
40,trashgang,classic,6,9 January 2011,"I just watched the uncut version of Friday the 13th. The movie means something special for me, it was the first horror I saw in my life. After all these years the films still works but sometimes it is also dated. But it is still a classic. After seeing it I thought, well, the score is a Psycho rip off. And the effects used by Tom Savini are nice but I have seen him done much better, for example The Prowler. When we saw this flick 30 years ago it was at cinema or at home, cinema didn't show the best quality then and televisions were small and it was broadcasted. Today it's all digital and we watch our flicks on much better screens. And there you can easily see the first killing how it was done (girl in the wood). Look at me arguing. It is still a hell of a movie. You just can't see the ending coming. The acting is superb. The use of score and camera is very well done and that for a movie that supposed to be a rip off of Halloween. There are much better flicks from the slasher era but this is one of the first to make a fuss and a lot of money and a franchise. A must see. But before I go, be sure to catch the Deluxe version, you know the ones with the 3D covers, only available in the US. There are some extras on it that you can't find anywhere else, not even on 'His Name Was Jason'. Also there is a kind of continuity on the DVD's. It's titled Lost Tales from Camp Blood: Part 1, but it's really gory and sadly there's no Jason in it but it's well done as an extra. It clocks in around 6 minutes but it's really a nice piece to see. It continues on Friday The 13th part 2 and so one...So if you are going for the Friday franchise be sure to catch the Deluxe versions.",Friday the 13th
41,mm-39,Doesn't age well,5,25 August 2000,"Warning spoiler sort of This film probably was exciting, and fresh for its time.  I finally rented it because its the original, and sequels most of the time become so watered down, why make them.  This film does not age well; like most action films it follows a formula of building up tension, knife in the head effects etc. Done so many times before, and its a rip off of Halloween, a much better film. It bores the viewer with seen that, done that before approch.  Special effects have improved so much in the last twenty year and gore is done a lot better. Decapitation is so common in movies to day, but in 1980 that was probably a shock.  We live in the time of exploding bodies and computerization.  The film shocked the hell out of every one in 80, but tame by todays standards, the only real tension starts at the end, with a few twists and scares.  I gave it a 5.  2 at the start 4 in the middle with the typical lets make out theme, and 7 for the ending.  The ending gave me a nightmare so thats not to bad, but doesn't save this film./",Friday the 13th

43,StevePulaski,The unintentional classic,8,25 October 2012,"We currently live in a decade where jump scares, shallow depth, and remakes along with sequels dominate the majority of horror films, and we must look to other resources in order to fill our cravings of fear. Or, we must return to the reliable decades of the seventies, eighties, and nineties when horror was huge. Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th was an unintentional genre-classic, that was intended as nothing more than a cash-in on the recent craze of John Carpenter's revolutionary Halloween and the Italian horror craze of the 1970's, started by Lucio Fulci.The story is simplicity in itself; we focus on a group of spry, young camp counselors spending their summer working at Camp Crystal Lake. The counselors are Alice (Adrienne King), Bill (Harry Crosby), Jack (Kevin Bacon), Brenda (Laurie Bartram) and Ned (Mark Nelson), but the names do not matter to most audience members. It's the frightening way these innocent people get killed off that does.And I must say, having not seen this film in ""x"" number of years, some sequence and kills still have the impact they had upon initial viewing. With my larger knowledge on the world of horror at this point in time, as well, it has become apparent how much the film borrows from Italian horror films, specifically Lucio Fulci's Zombie and Dario Argento's Suspiria. The cinematography is placed in front of everything else, and the blood is brightly colored and incredibly stylistic. Also stylistic are the shots of the camp's wooded environment, which appear to be in their rawest possible form. Between cracking branches, brushing leaves, and every step an unsteady, everything is strong and realistic here.The film's use of darkness and suspense is surprising clear and well-focused. It's not so dark, where everything is obscure and indefinable, and it isn't so light that the intensity of the film is derailed. It is perfectly photographed through a clear, versatile lens that is easy on the eyes and pleasantly original at the same time.Friday the 13th, I must reiterate, is an ""unintentional classic."" A film that was meant to be a shameless cash grab, but resulted in ten sequels, one reboot, a line of merchandise, and a cult phenomenon like few horror films have seen before. Cunningham's camera-work is incredibly fluent and absorbing, the suspense is jolting, and the cinematography, along with the haunting atmosphere, is nothing shy of gripping and fascinatingly raw. It's one of the better horror films of the eighties; the rare case where a cheap ""copy"" actually became an overwhelmingly unpredicted success.Starring: Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Laurie Bartram, Mark Nelson, Jeannine Taylor, Robbi Morgan, Kevin Bacon, Ari Lehman, and Betsy Palmer. Directed by: Sean S. Cunningham.",Friday the 13th
44,Smells_Like_Cheese,The film that started it all,7,14 November 2003,"Friday the 13th, as we all know, it's the film that started it all when it came to one of the most memorable boogeymen, Jason Vorhees. I'm afraid though that this isn't the film that he stars in, it's actually his mother that started the whole ""have sex and die"" sacred rule of horror movies. Friday the 13th has kind of a harsh rating here on IMDb, this is a classic in some sense I think, it's the ultimate sleepover movie and still gives me a little scare when I watch it in the dark. Friday the 13th also started the cheesy acting, un-needed sex scenes, blood, and gore; wither that's a good or bad thing, I'm still not sure, but one thing that Friday the 13th does deliver is awesome death scenes that will never disappoint. It'll also make you think twice about going to camp.A group of young adults are opening up Camp Crystal Lake after 20 years, the place has been dubbed as a cursed camp where two young counselors were brutally murdered and a young boy drowned. But the group continues getting the camp ready, but when a nasty storm ensues, the group separates and does their own thing. But one by one, they keep disappearing, but when Alice, one of the camp counselors is concerned with how everyone is not returning, she goes to find a nasty discovery and will have to survive the most terrifying night of her life.Friday the 13th is a memorable film in it's own right, I know that the performances are horrible, I mean, this is no Halloween, but it's a different concept and scared a lot of people. I remember it scared me as a kid to go to camp, that's for sure. But it has tense music and very scary scenes and it keeps the best going, along with a huge amount of sequels to come, we're up to 20, right? LOL, just kidding, it's only 10 that I'm aware of, but I would recommend Friday the 13th for the horror fans, it's always a fun movie to watch.7/10",Friday the 13th
45,blanbrn,A Classic. A film that helped start a pop culture trend of memorable slasher flicks of the 80's.,8,13 June 2008,"""Friday the 13th"" is certainly a film that helped start a run of memorable horror flicks of the 80's. As in the time period of the late 70's and early 80's teen slasher flicks and blood gore was the norm. And true this may not be the scariest or best horror film it certainly is well done entertainment that started a run of film after film during the 80's the continuing saga of Jason became a pop culture trend and this 1980 original started it. Terror and suspense is abound and common during this movie, with the setting being Camp Crystal Lake which has been shut down for over twenty years due to several gruesome unsolved murders only to just have recently been reopened by a new camp counselor despite the warning of death curses from local residents. It proves true as one by one in a manner of gore and blood each teen at the camp meets a violent and cruel end. Most memorable is a young Kevin Bacon as his character departs by receiving an arrow thru the throat! The only left over turns out to be Alice(Adrienne King)and a shocking discovery is made in the end with the killers identity being Mrs. Voorhees(Betsy Palmer)and her reasons for revenge is revealed and this reason would spark many more bloody films of this saga. Overall a good classic that started a pop culture wave of blood, gore, and terror and the music theme is also pulsating and spooky.",Friday the 13th
46,MovieAddict2016,Really...bad.,4,24 October 2005,"I'm not sure how this is considered by some people to be a ""classic"" horror film. It is one of the better horror films released in the 1980s, but that's not saying much in the era of a gazillion sequels per franchise and films like ""Boogeyman"" and ""Critters."" ""Friday the 13th"" is a poorly made movie. The acting is awful, the direction is bad, the chills n' thrills don't even deliver much - it's not all that spooky, even when taken as a ""low budget"" movie. Before you slam me for criticizing a semi-independent film - John Carpenter managed to make a classic on a low budget too (""Halloween""); his film was similar in approach (masked killer goes on a murderous rampage) but about a hundred times better.""Friday the 13th"" is laughable. It's just poorly done and even the editing is sloppy. Okay, it's got a few entertaining parts, but more so because they're so bad they're funny. The ending is an absolute hoot and not scary at all. The ""surprise"" revelation is a shock - if you haven't ever seen any other horror movies, namely ""Psycho."" It's the same thing, only in reverse.As a side note, I watched it on AMC's so-called ""DVD_TV"" last night, which features trivia facts about the film on the screen as you watch the film itself. According to them, the actress who played Jason's mother considered herself to be a great method actor, and she thought the script was ""crap."" She took the job to afford a new car but managed to let everyone know she was better than them on the set; she also claimed in an interview that she almost got lost on the way to the set the first day, and she didn't know ""what they would have done"" if she hadn't shown up. Talk about self-infatuation! Oh, and in case she's ever reading this while following up on her theatrical efforts and emailing her IMDb bio to her friends to brag - tracing a crappy Z-grade slasher character's roots back ""to her high school days"" isn't commendable when the character in question is a psychopathic nut with no real motivation!

Camp counselors try to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, a summer camp, after the incident of a child's drowning and are stalked and murdered, one by one, by an unknown attacker.The unknown attacker steals the show and is the only character who gives the movie any sort of thrills and suspense. The rest of the characters, a bunch of oversexed young camp counselors, were very sub-par in their acting performances and delivered cheesy dialog and dragged on the story a bit. This make it a very typical teenager horror flick; however, since this is one of the first original slasher movies of its kind, this film does hold well on its own and is mildly better than some of the later horror/slasher flicks released either theatrically or direct-to-video.The plot is pretty basic - a lot of running around, slashing and screaming - not much substance. But, the movie actually has some very creepy and scary moments that jump at you and tension built-up that will have you biting your fingernails; therefore, I remembered I wasn't too bored by the movie. Despite the cheesy acting and a plain plot, I actually thought the film was a little entertaining. It's not a masterpiece, but it has some fun to it nonetheless.Grade C+",Friday the 13th
50,sddavis63,"""Then He's Still Out There""",7,29 October 2009,"I'll concede right off that it's very hard to be objective in reviewing this movie. The truth is I've never seen it until today, but it's spawned so many sequels and become such a part of popular culture (for better or worse) that it's stamped into your mind whether you've seen it or not. Trying to be objective I'd say - it's not bad. It's not as good as what I would consider to be the classic of the slasher movies (1978's Halloween) but it has some moments of pretty good suspense and somewhat surprisingly to me I found that it wasn't a ""gore-fest."" There's violence and blood but the murders, while they're portrayed, tend to be shown quickly and the movie moves on fairly quickly. The setting is used pretty well to create atmosphere - the movie is set in a remote camp about to be re-opened after being closed for over 20 years following the murders of two counsellors in 1958. Those murders kick off the movie. There's some decent camera-work, as the camera serves as the eyes of the killer, and at times that effect is used when the camera isn't being used as the eyes of the killer, so there's a bit of uncertainty for the viewer. It is a bit of a chuckle that this movie uses as its setting the classically bad opening of terrible novels (""it was a dark and stormy night."")The performances were OK, if a little bit forced and artificial at times. Adrienne King did a good job near the end of the movie as the terrified Alice. Kevin Bacon had a role in this as Jack, but it wasn't the lead role, and aside from him no one from the movie rose to any significant stature in Hollywood and there was certainly no Jamie Lee Curtis (see Halloween) among the female leads, although there were many shots of young and cute women in various stages of undress!Strange to say, but in some ways knowing the basic outline of how the series progresses adds to the suspense at the end of the movie as to the identity of the killer, and does get you wondering how the heck this is going to lead to sequels - or at least to the sequels it led to, although Alice's last line (""then he's still out there"") clearly establishes that those responsible for the movie were already looking ahead to the sequels. Not having been really interested in the series before this, I will confess that, having seen the first instalment, I now have a certain curiosity to see how the second instalment is constructed. 7/10",Friday the 13th
51,thesar-2,Six Degrees of Sliced Bacon,8,12 January 2009,"About a month from the day I write this review, my first of any 'Friday the 13th' film reviews, comes the remake of the 1980 original. (Well, the new one's more a reimagining of Parts 1, 2 and 3.) I grew up on the 'Friday,' 'Nightmare' and 'Halloween' franchises, but the ones that scared me the most were the 'Friday' films due to the large, menacing and unstoppable Jason Voorhees. That being said, part 1 scared me the least due to the fact the film only reveals a glimpse of the soon-to-be iconic serial-camp-counselor-killer Jason and the fact it shows the killer in first person view, i.e. the camera shows little of the killer and puts viewers in the driver's seat while the killer stalks the victims  one of my all-time pet-peeves. Giving it another glance, and as a movie critic, I am astonished to say, the movie wasn't half-bad. The score was incredible  a take back to 'Psycho,' the acting was plausible, the novelty (at the time) and the fact the original was so stand-alone, meaning, it really could've finished with movie 1, made it an effective, thrilling and scary horror movie. If one were to watch today for the first time, they would probably say , ""look at the clichés!"" but not realize, this really was the one that started all those iconic ""Oh, it's you, I'm safe"" formulaic scenes. It worked on the basic fact, these kids (the movie's only flaw involved their sexual desire  a la soft porn/horror, see 'Scream') really didn't know how much in trouble they were in, or had no basis to feel unsafe while trying to revamp a kid's camp after a young boy died years before.

You're all doomed.""",7,21 May 2006,"Friday the 13th may not have been the first movie of its kind and the kill scenes may have been copied from other movies, but there's no denying the importance of the film. Friday the 13th is the film I see as most responsible for the slasher boom of the 80s. It and its sequels proved that horror fans were willing to pay money to see practically the same movie (with slight modifications) over and over. As I look back at it now, it seems a bit silly to me, but I was one of those who willing plopped down my money every few years for a chance to see another Friday the 13th movie.I don't see any point in going through the plot. Most horror fans know it by heart. Instead, I'll cover a few of the things I like about the movie. First, the kill scenes. Tom Savini's special effects are great. I especially like the scene where Kevin Bacon is speared from under the bed. Second, regardless of the number of times I've seen it, the film does have an atmosphere of fear about it. The repetitive music, the unseen killer, and the bodies dropping at every turn have always given me chills. Third, I enjoy the final showdown between the killer and the ""final girl"". I've always thought the final fight scene was a highlight of the film. Finally, and this is a personal thing, but Friday the 13th was the first movie of its type I ever saw. I hadn't seen movies like Halloween or Black Christmas when I first saw this one. Therefore, it holds a special place with me.Unfortunately, even though I'm a fan, I see problems. The biggest is the predictability of the plot. Even though Friday the 13th was made early in the slasher cycle, how hard was it to predict the outcome? Also, the characters in the movie are incredibly stupid. A lot of the murders could have been prevented if anyone at any point in the movie had demonstrated any brain power. But then it wouldn't have been so much fun.It may not be the kind of movie the more ""sophisticated"" horror fan admits to enjoying, but I'm not above admitting that Friday the 13th remains a favorite of mine. It's fun stuff!",Friday the 13th

54,Robert_duder,The appropriate film for the appropriate day...a stone cold slasher classic,7,13 June 2008,"Today is Friday June 13th and I've been waiting anxiously so I could re-watch one of my favorite slashers...Friday The 13th. The film also takes place on Friday June 13th so it was fate. This classic slasher was made on a superbly low budget...less than a million dollars which is paltry even to standards in 1980. And yet the film manages to be incredibly creepy, gory and a stone cold classic that spawned one of the most successful horror series' of all time. I always judge a great 80's slasher by the creativity of the murders and the creation of the killer and Friday The 13th excels in both aspects. They create the entire world of Camp Crystal Lake and the back story of the Voorhees family. The film is light on plot, that being said, as it's mostly each camp counselor being picked off randomly one by one until there is one left to finally fight back. You can also catch an early Kevin Bacon last a half hour in the film but still looks more or less the same. The gore is cheesy and yet still pretty well done considering the budget. The film is very dark probably mostly due to budget constraints but also to try and create an atmosphere the easy way so it's not so bad.No one on the cast really stands out because most of them don't last very long. They are also not exactly stellar actors but even still they serve their purpose. Harry Crosby, Laurie Bartram, Jeannine Taylor, Kevin Bacon, Mark Nelson, and Peter Brouwer, are the main victims throughout the film and they have good chemistry together as a cast and they play the wild youngsters pretty well. No one truly stands out in the film. Adrienne King (who hasn't officially acted since this role) plays main scream queen Alice Hardy. Like most 80's scream queen a la Jamie Lee Curtis she is the more innocent and reserved member of the cast. She also puts up the most fight but she is very campy in her performance. It's almost laughable and yet she's a classic character to the film. Betsy Palmer plays killer Mom Mrs. Voorhees and she is certainly not the most typical killer. However she is almost laughable when she starts to channel her supposedly dead son in a high pitch voice ""Kill her Mommy, Kill her."" Yes the movie is campy and corny and hardly scary unless you have a really weak stomach for the sort of thing but it's one of those films that somehow had the magic to become a timeless Horror classic and you have to respect it for that. I've seen the film a dozen times and I never get tired of it. It's mercifully short and still fun to watch and have a laugh and a little scream and if you like Horror Series films like I do it launches one of the true greats. It's fun to watch and it's fun to see the creativity they put into making this low budget but still putting their all behind it. Figure the eleven films plus the upcoming remake in 2009 have probably come close to a billion dollars in profit off the beginning of 700 thousand...pretty amazing. It's a classic and you can't even touch being a horror fan without seeing it again and again. And today is the perfect day to watch it. 7/10",Friday the 13th
55,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Its inherent, scrappy charm is enhanced precisely because it is a bit rough around the edges.",6,13 April 2018,"'Friday The 13th (1980)' has an inherent, scrappy charm to it that's enhanced precisely because it is a little rough around the edges, coming off the coveted coat-tails of low-budget horror-thrillers like Halloween (1978). Yet, the feature does fall victim to the usual faults that plague this genre and actually creates some new problems for itself, all of which stem from the fact that much of the run-time is dedicated to hiding the killer that's on the loose. Despite the sometimes lacklustre acting - though here it's actually considerably better than it could have been - and restrictive camera-work, the movie manages to maintain a persistent level of engagement by including a number of grisly killings, made all the more believable by Tom Savini's impressive prosthetic work, and relying upon a central conceit that's rather interesting considering what it sets up and subsequently subverts, even if it is handled somewhat poorly in the end-product. 6/10",Friday the 13th
56,bowmanblue,"Judge it on what it was, not what it is now",6,13 October 2014,"If you ignore 'Halloween' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' you could say that 'Friday 13th' 'started' the whole 'slasher' genre. It was made on comparatively little and made a hell of a lot at the box office, so it must have a certain something. Not only that, but it spawned about ten sequels, a spin-off and a remake.If you don't know, it's about a camp of over-sexed teenagers who get slaughtered one by one by an unseen assailant. Hardly a deep and meaningful plot, but it certainly struck a chord with the audiences of 1980.However, today, and several thousand similar movies later, it all seems a little tame. We're all used to the acting not being up to much in these sorts of films, but here, it really is pretty weak. Plus there isn't much gore (not up to today's standards anyway!) and the film is effectively watching each character for about five minutes as they wander around a deserted part of the camp, before being killed. Rinse and repeat until you're left with just the one. And the 'lead girl' is no 'Lara Croft.' Don't expect her to be particularly pro-active at fighting back against the killer when they're finally revealed. She mainly screams hysterically and runs away (occasionally spending five minutes of screen time barricading a door, only to remove her creation about thirty seconds later).So, Friday 13th actually isn't that good. However, it's still a classic. And I still enjoy watching it. Mainly because I look at it from an eighties perspective and can see how shocking it was for its day. It deserves its place in the horror hall of fame, even if it is a little damp compared with today's offerings. Modern classics like 'Scream' outwit it, out-gore it, out-plot-twist it and out-act it at every turn. But, without Friday 13th, there may not have been a 'Scream' to out perform it.If you haven't seen it, put yourself in the place of the audience in 1980 and don't judge it by today's standards. Then you can enjoy seeing Kevin Bacon in a kind of odd role!",Friday the 13th
57,ThomasDrufke,Silly Slasher,4,21 October 2016,"Out of all the horror slasher to be blatantly inspired by Hitchcock's Psycho, Friday the 13th felt the most uninhabited by an overall great story. Besides blood, guts, and sex, there isn't a whole lot here. For that, I had a hard time getting behind this film. Taking on the similar approach that most horror films take, Friday the 13th takes place at Camp Crystal Lake, a secluded kids camp in the middle of dark woods area. So it's kind of like Evil Dead, just with absolutely no likable or built out characters. Sure, ""Jason"" doesn't start taking people out until 30 minutes in or so, but there was never any effort to build any of the characters' depth through good writing. Every one of them simply wants to get laid on the campgrounds. That's poor storytelling. So when the brutal kills do happen, you don't really care. Granted, the last act reveals more about the characters than the entire rest of the film, but at that point it was too late for me. The surprises in the 3rd act are cool, but I can't get behind the stupidity of the majority of the characters.4.6/10",Friday the 13th

59,CuriosityKilledShawn,"A slick potboiler, but pretty tame in retrospect.",5,17 April 1999,"In 1979 Sean S. Cunningham was looking to produce a mere potboiler to tide him over until his next serious project. His idea of a Summer Camp Killer movie seemed like a decent, low-budget, one-shot deal and he went with it. There was nothing particularly memorable or unique about it but it was bought by Paramount and released as a mainstream film, rather than a independent struggler. The response was huge and it soon became clear that Friday the 13th was not a mere paycheck but a serious cash-cow. Sequels followed. And the rest is history.Many, many people claim that Friday the 13th rips off Halloween. Which is not a very fair or kind statement. Sure, it's no work of art and has many similarities, but Halloween was NOT the first slasher movie as Black Christmas and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre came before it. I was actually draw more parallels between this and The Last House on the Left, which was also produced by Cunningham. Friday the 13th is a slicker, tamer film in comparison but if TLHOTL never existed then we would have the Friday the 13th franchise that we have today.The characters and deaths are not so imaginative. All we really get is throat slashings and impalings. But at least the fodder are not as obnoxious and annoying as they would later become in the sequels, when they truly deserved more grotesque deaths.At the time, the ending was surprising only because it came out of nowhere. The sudden unveiling of the killer and motives was random and unexpected. It's weird watching it now, knowing that Jason and parts 2-infinity were never planned. Jason was just a dead boy and nothing more.It's hard to review Friday the 13th on it's own merits rather than the movie that launched a major franchise. A low-brow slasher script made into a potboiler movie that ended up making zillions in sequels, spin-offs, TV series', toys, games and accessories seems so far-fetched.",Friday the 13th

Betsy Palmer deserved her nomination, because her performance was really terrible, but ""Friday the 13th"" is by no means the worst movie. It's far from a great movie, even within the genre, and the story is pretty lousy, but this film also has its qualities and merits. First I must give it recognition for the main characters behavior. In most horror movies characters pull completely illogical moves, that anyone with any brains would never do, just because it's more convenient for writers to keep the story in the right direction. If they act wisely, they might save themselves, which does not suit the authors of the horror, and I can understand that. But dammit, have a little respect for the intelligence of the audience. There are no such irritably stupid illogicalities here, but Miller and Cunningham still manage to maintain tension and kill everyone. This film, along with the first ""Halloween"", is considered to be the originator of a slasher horror, but unlike most of its genre, it's not based so much on bloody scenes as on the construction of a stressful and creepy atmosphere, which is greatly contributed by good sound effects. Of the more famous actors there is only Kevin Bacon, but for horror it is a plus, because the unknown faces make the story more convincing. All in all, an average good horror, with a cult status for fans of the genre that marked the 1980s. I totally agree with IMDb rating of6,5/10",Friday the 13th
62,ironhorse_iv,"Watching Friday the 13th on Friday the 13th. It's a alright film. Not that sharp, but still cutting edge",6,13 September 2013,"The only thing scary about Friday the 13th is if Rebecca Black star in the film and start singing. Friday the 13th has always been considered an unlucky day at least since the 14th century. Many people that Friday was the day that Jesus Christ was crucified adding to its unpopularity. It's a superstition that continue to haunt people even today. It made sense, in a marketing standpoint, that horror movie was going to be created for this. Sadly, the film doesn't deal with the paranormal, occultism, or anything to do with the fear of the date. Rather, the audience is treated with slasher film. Don't get me wrong, the Friday the 13th film series is one of the greatest horror series in the world, but just think of how awesome it would had been if they kept the original superstition in the film. I know the TV series dealt with the bad luck and curses, but the film should had too. Unlike the other Friday the 13th sequels and reboots, Friday the 13th, the original film lacks a big man character. Don't bother watching it, if you looking for the fictional character Jason Voorhees. He barely show up in the film. Plus, he didn't even don his hockey mask yet. So that is a letdown. The film mainly focuses on Jason Voorhees, who drowned as a boy at Camp Crystal Lake due to the negligence of the camp staff. Decades later, the lake is rumored to be ""cursed"" and is the setting for a series of mass murders. It doesn't stop, the camp's new owner and seven young counselors are readying the property for re-opening despite warnings by local residents. The curse proves true on Friday the 13th as one by one each of the counselors is stalked by a fierce killer. The movie directed by Sean Cunningham is probably well known for the twist about who the murderer really is. I have to say it's pretty predictable who did it, even if you haven't watch the other films. The movie fails to explain why the killer was killing people off, now. Are they still related to the drowning of Jason? Is the person just angry that the camp is opening up again? Plus, how on the Earth did the way older killer with that small body size kill younger people three times her size? It's seem unrealistic. I love the POV, seeing through the eyes of a killer. People say it's from 1978's Halloween, but I have to disagree with them. I think this point of view film making was create by Michael Powell for his film 1960's Peeping Tom. The ending fight is just laughable, and takes too long. The ending with the last survivor in the canoe on the lake was pretty good, but sadly it was just a dream. The whole reason for the 'dream' cliffhanger at the end to make the sequel with Jason. The cast stereotypes are pretty tamed compare to the sequels. They were a bit likable, unlike the sequels where the victims are made out to be spoil brats. Nice to see a pre-famous, Kevin Bacon in this film. The acting was mediocre at best. There are two version of this film out there. The Uncut version and R Rated version. There isn't much different between the two, trust me. I think the uncut version is probably worst than the R Rated one as it seem like they cut more from the film. It has low production values, and the gore wasn't too badly made. It look pretty real to me. I fail to see a moral's message in the film, if only the screenwriters were to make the story have more depth, then it can work better. Between the violent and the sex scenes, it just seem wasted time that could had focus more on what the story is supposed to bring out. It seem pointless and boring. There is a lot of nostalgia feel to the film, as it did help establish the now overused clichés of slasher films like the last survivor being a woman and having pointless nudity and gore. Somewhat, I kinda miss the Alfred Hitchcock's type of slasher films. The film seem to take 1960's Psycho shrieking violins and try to make it seem like its own. It doesn't work. . The hiss soundtrack was amazing, but can be annoying. It goes on way too long. It does work for the film, but it made me wonder if a snake guy was chasing them. Overall: it's one of the films, you have to watch at less once, if you into the 1980's horror genre. Just don't think too much about it when watching. It's just one of those films you watch if you want cheap thrills.",Friday the 13th

It's fun to watch, it's scary, has some great death scenes (the best thing in the show), lots of blood and screams, some cheesy lines and some funny parts, all the main ingredients for a great slasher film with body parts all around. And of course, at last but not least, it's a film too easy on the brain, doesn't need much to hold its audience and I believe anyone can write something like that in one day, there's no secrets. I prefer more intellectual horror films but this one worked fine for me.The coolest move of ""Friday the 13th"" is revealing the killer only when the last possible victim lasts, so throughout the whole thing is an effective editing showing the killer's point of view and we keep wondering why such things are happening.

Two sneak off to a nearby barn where they are brutally murdered by an unseen killer. In the modern day (well, 1980), a fresh gang of horny teenagers are making their way to a recently re-opened Camp Crystal Lake, ignoring the warnings of local madman Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney) that the place is cursed. They learn that years ago a young boy drowned in the lake, and the place has never been the same. The group soon find themselves being picked off one-by-one in various bloody ways.Following the success of John Carpenter's excellent Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th was greenlit with a modest budget and an unknown young cast (including an early appearance by Kevin Bacon). The film proved a huge success, and is one of the most financially profitable slasher films ever made. How this happened I don't know, as despite the franchise's cult following, and the iconic character of Jason Voorhees (who doesn't appear here), the Friday the 13th films are as mundane and as formulaic as practically every slasher of the era. The original, which you would expect to the best or at least prove moderately memorable, is dull, predictable and shockingly unimaginative.It plays out like a beginner's guide to the slasher film - horny, naive youngsters; a blissful location full of murky history; a stalking killer; 80's haircuts; minimal budget; terrible fashion. But there's just nothing to take from this film that hasn't been done far better in other horrors. Given that horror legend/genius Tom Savini is on hand to do the visual effects, the murders are terribly bland, with only Kevin Bacon's early demise proving remotely memorable. There are some minor plus-points - the soundtrack is iconic, there are plenty of annoying characters whose deaths you can eagerly await, and there is a silly but enjoyable final 'shock'.

The gore, the killer POV, the infamous ""ki ki ki, ma ma ma"", the chilling Orchestral score, the crystal lake environment, etc. Those elements have inspired hundreds of Slasher flicks.Many people have watched the sequels first than the original because of the Jason Voorhees phenomenon that makes the sequels more attractive. The truth is that the original Friday is the scariest of the whole franchise. Mr. Cunningham created a movie that has a feeling of fear, uncertainty, and creepiness that only a few Horror movies from the 80's have managed to create.

It has been ripped off to no end, leaving it little more than a brittle skeleton of its original self, but it was also a rip off of Halloween, so I suppose in a way it has gotten what it deserves. It is a very basic horror film and has been since the day it was released, where a lot of teenagers go out to some remote location, ignore every possibly sign of danger, and start getting killed in the same order that they start getting naked. It is a curious phenomenon that so many horror films seem determined to punish promiscuity as brutally as possible. Maybe the directors are insecure about their daughters or something.Today, the film has been reduced to little more than a curiosity piece for horror movie fans, but also fills the important slot as the original film in one of the largest horror series' of all time. Maybe even one of the best, at least considering the fact that most of its competitors are just as bad after the original film. I haven't seen Jason X yet, and have been going back to watch all of the older ones so that I can see it in the right order, but I thought it might be interesting to watch the original film and then watch Jason X right afterward, just to see how far the series has come (or to see how far the special effects have come, at least. My expectations for Jason X are pretty abysmal).As far as being entertaining, I don't think that Friday the 13th has suffered too much, although it has turned into an entirely different kind of entertainment than when it was first released as a horror film. Normally when a horror film comes off as funny, it is a sign of the film's failure, but I don't consider the hilarity of the original Friday the 13th as a mark against it at all as much as a sign of the durability of the film. If it can't scare you anymore, it will entertain you in any way it can.You don't watch a film like the original Friday the 13th to get scared, you watch it to laugh at how stupid teenagers can be, you watch it to wonder if your parents really played such astronomically moronic games as strip Monopoly in the woods in the pouring rain, and more than anything else, you watch it to see a young Kevin Bacon frolic around in some tiny jean shorts.

Like John Carpenter's ""Halloween,"" this classic changed the date forever. Palmer & King are great, Savini's make-up effects are terrific as usual and who can forget Harry Manfredini's chilling score.

79,Captain_Couth,The start of a new generation in horror film-making!,6,26 November 2003,"Friday the 13th (1980) kicked started the early 80's slasher film phenomenon that was ignited by Halloween (1978) but fueled intensely by this reworking of the Mario Bava classic ""Twitch of the Death Nerve"".

A film that launched countless knock-offs, wannabes, sequels and a t.v. series?! Camp Crystal Lake and the Friday the 13th film franchise are a part of Americana. The film is merely a stage for the splatter effects of F/X maestro Tom Savini. They were later toned down for it's American release and were softened even further during it's video release.The movie itself isn't that great. Technically it's boring. To get the most out of the film you have to watch it uncut. Friday the 13th was designed around Savini's gory set pieces. Watching them with out it is like drinking a mayonnaise soda.

80,bsmith5552,Murder and Mayhem at Camp Christy Lake!,7,31 October 2002,"""Friday the 13th"" is the first and by far the best of the lengthy horror series. When first released, it was fresh and original and a darn good horror flick to boot. The story centers around a group of teen age camp councillors hired by camp manager Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer) who are making preparations to open Camp Christy Lake for the summer. What they don't know or believe is that some twenty plus years previously, two other councillors were brutally murdered by an unknown assailant. When Christy goes to town the present day councillors are left alone at night during a bad storm. All the elements for murder and mayhem are now in place. Unbeknownst to the others, one of their number, the cook Annie (Robbie Morgan) has already been murdered on her way to the camp. Director Sean S. Cunningham builds the suspense as one by one each of the kids meets a particularly gruesome end, until only Alice (Adrienne King) is left. At first the town crazy (Walt Gorney) is suspected but he is much too obvious. All the while though, Cunningham skillfully hides the identity of the real killer until the end.  The cast was made up of mostly unknown actors (at the time) with the exception of Betsy Palmer who plays the mother of a boy who had drowned in the lake. A very young Kevin Bacon plays Jack and Harry Crosby (son of Bing) play Jack two of the councillors. The other councillors are Laurie Barton as Brenda, Jeannine Taylor as Marcie and Mark Nelson as Ned. ""Friday the 13th"" is a grisly teen age slasher/sex movie to be sure, but it was among the first of the genre and as such, is much better than any of its sequels or many of its imitators.",Friday the 13th

""Friday the 13th"", on the other hand, doesn't really have any characters with distinct personalities, and the one who emerges as ""the hero"", at least by virtue of surviving the massacre, is indistinguishable from all the other characters. It feels like someone needs to survive, and be the hero, so it might as well be them. This is not how you make a character the audience cares about, or wants to see survive.The film is basically just gore effects with a thin plot hung over them.

However, my personal favourite of this genre is Friday the 13th (1980). It doesn't have a hockey-masked Jason going around killing and in terms of gore and nudity is pretty tame compared to some of it's many sequels or films such as The Burning. What sets this entry above all the others is it's superior direction, great camera work (which includes some excellent POV), a hugely effective soundtrack by Harry Manfredini, it's suspense, characters (Crazy Ralph in particular), Tom Savini's iconic special effects, especially the Kevin Bacon & Betsy Palmer deaths and one of the best jump-out-of-your-skin endings ever. The final confrontation between killer & the final girl reminds me of some of the psycho thrillers from the 1960's, but in rich bloody colour!

84,dee.reid,"Not the most pleasant ""Friday""",5,22 January 2011,"To give credit to Sean S. Cunningham, director of ""Friday the 13th,"" probably the next most influential slasher film after John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" (1978), the film does have a nice suspenseful tone, some pretty creative camera-work, and some of Tom Savini's best special effects work outside of what he's done with George A. Romero (it is a shame that the tight-wads at the MPAA censored the crap out of this movie, and most people wouldn't be able to see this film in its full uncut gory glory until 2009).Too bad the rest of the movie isn't up to par. ""Friday the 13th,"" to its credit, does rehash many of the stylistic techniques made famous in ""Halloween"" (though of course that movie didn't originate them, but made them popular), including hiding the identity of the assailant by giving a first-person perspective of the mayhem, a gutsy female protagonist, a memorable score (by Harry Manfredini), the first-person stalking of potential victims, and lots of creative blood-drenched killings.I must say that I am not a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" movies. I've always believed them to be the least innovative of the post-""Halloween"" slasher imitators. I tried to watch this film a long while back, but stopped after about 20 minutes because I thought it was so bad. Having watched the film in its entirety finally, I feel that I can at least confirm my mixed feelings about this flick. To give credit to the filmmakers, the deaths are pretty slick (I have yet to see the uncut version of the film yet, but oh well), the mood is pretty intense especially in the last 20 minutes, Tom Savini's special effects - what's left of them in the film, at least - are off the wall, the Manfredini score chills you to the bone and I can honestly see why it's so popular finally, though I'm not sure I agree with the reasons why.The film is nicely directed, but lazily written and acted (the low-budget can probably be blamed for some of this, but I think I can excuse it). ""Friday the 13th"" opens at the now-infamous Camp Crystal Lake in 1958, and two hormonally-charged camp counselors are promptly dispatched by an unseen assailant. 22 years later, the camp's owners are trying to get it fixed up in an effort to have it re-opened. Despite the warnings of the town's superstitious locals, six new counselors have showed up in town to aid in the repairs. Soon enough, they all start getting knocked off one at a time in some pretty creative and gruesome fashions.""Friday the 13th"" is most notorious for having jump-started probably the longest-running horror franchise in cinema history. It's also notorious for giving birth to the most boring screen slasher ever: Jason Voorhees. Though of course, in this movie the killer is actually Jason's mother Pamela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer). Jason wouldn't appear on-screen himself until the next feature, ""Friday the 13th, Part 2"" (1981).5/10P.S.: I did unfortunately get more entertainment out of this film's blood-drenched 2009 remake, however.",Friday the 13th

The storyline focuses on a group of camp counselors trying to reopen a campground for the first time since a boy named Jason drowned at the camp. Little do camp counselors know the lake is cursed and they are about to be hunted. This movie is directed by Sean S. Cunningham (DeepStar Six) who produced but surprisingly didn't direct any additional Friday the 13th pictures. This movie stars Kevin Bacon (Tremors and everything else), Betsy Palmer (Penny Dreadful), Adrienne King (The Good Son), Mark Nelson (The Good Wife) and Robbi Morgan (The Great Outdoors. The storyline for this picture and kill scenes are of course so fun. The soundtrack is epic and absolutely brilliant very much in Jaws fashion which worked so well for this genre. Yes, there's some campy cheesy slasher lines and sequences, but that's what makes the classic slasher films great. This film has so much appreciated rewatchability.

In many ways, it's also a bridge from the clunkier horror flicks of the preceding decade. The effects are often laughable, the acting is paper-thin and the production values seem extremely cheap and dated. Very few of the characters are even remotely likable, either, which makes their relentless slaughter into something of a spectator sport. Once it ditches the vague premonitions and hammy teenage dialog that flood the first act, the film settles into a nice groove: stalk, scare, chase, kill, repeat. The mainstream success of Jason as a horror icon even gives this first entry a little boost, misleading first-time viewers into a surprise reveal at the climax (and, of course, an infamous jump-scare just before the credits). From a critical perspective it's not good, but lasting influence and dogged determination carry it a long way.",Friday the 13th

89,jimbo-53-186511,"Generally creepy and suspenseful, but it's held back by dumb plotting and an atrocious final act",5,11 August 2015,"The basic premise here focuses on a group of teenagers who are stalked whilst staying at Camp Crystal Lake. The sight is referred to by some locals as 'Camp Blood' due to the many mysterious deaths that have occurred there over the years. However, these teenagers are unfazed and choose to ignore warnings from the locals and decide to stay there and try and re-open Camp Crystal Lake.The early stages of the film are OK and it doesn't take long to gather momentum. It's also clear that director Sean Cunningham is trying to ape Spielberg in terms of his approach here - we get lots of tight close up shots of the killer, but their identity is kept a secret for most of the running time. Cunningham does well to keep you interested in what's happening and when the inevitable killings start they are all quite well-staged (with Kevin Bacon's death being both memorable and surprising). I also liked the way that clichéd jump scares were kept to a minimum and the real hook here is wondering when and how the killer is going to off each of the teenagers. It's never really a brilliant film, but it is quite effective in what it does. I also liked the way that the story is set up in that everyone warns the teenagers about the bad things that have happened at Camp Crystal Lake and the teenagers refusing to believe it. This very much falls back on 'teenagers knowing best' and all adults are wrong and this element of the story is probably one of the more believable aspects. Anyway enough with the praise, let's look at some problems.....Well for a start, I found it hard to believe that a summer camp area would be allowed to be re-opened after several deaths have taken place there over the years. Logically, it would remain closed for the public's safety until such time as evidence would have been gathered to try and find the perpetrator's identity. Further evidence that this film isn't grounded in reality comes with the way that all the teens are picked off one by one with no-one noticing anything is wrong till there's only one or two of them are left. The first girl gets killed and no-one even notices she's missing or wonders where she is; the killer offs the protagonists in a violent and noisy manner, but no-one hears anything; the killer enters and exits the house without anyone noticing.Despite these problems, the film generally remained enjoyable and I thought as I watched it 'Yeah the plotting is a bit dumb, but the film itself isn't too bad'. What really lets this film down is its embarrassing finale which actually undid all of the intrigue and suspense that director Cunningham had created for the first 75 minutes. We see Jason's mad mother (in a rather competent, but over-the-top performance by Betsy Palmer) trying to pick off the last survivor. Whilst this was quite a fun little game of cat and mouse, it lacked the suspense and tension that we'd witnessed with all the previous killings and ended up verging dangerously close to self parody.Friday the 13th is a fairly effective film (at the least for the first 75 minutes). The dumb and far-fetched plot elements meant it was never going to brilliant, but up to this point it had enough suspense & tension to make it worth watching. However, for me the final act cheapened everything that preceded it and ended up almost ruining the overall viewing experience.",Friday the 13th

I'm the man! Whoo!!! The original is the only Friday movie that I give a ten to, there's just something very special about it to me, and it's certainly the one that I find the most creepy. It's such a good old-fashioned stalk and slash through the dark of the highest order! Perhaps it's even the granddaddy of all such grisly fare. I'm aware that it isn't quite the first slasher ever, but it was certainly an influential game changer and a definer of the genre. It was definitely one of the first to, whether they were aware of what they were doing or not, wholeheartedly embrace all of the beloved 'rules' and themes of the slasher. It works as an 'official' template for them all. Now it's probably considered to be fairly standard stuff by most folks, but I for one love it. The dialogue and characterisation is more than a little on the hokey side, but the most endearing quality is the fantastic haunting atmosphere, the ever- present surroundings of the beautiful lake and foreboding woods are so eerie. And then there's the music, and the iconic 'Jason' noise, and crazy old hag Mrs.Voorhees with her blue sweater and big nasty dentures! Very sorry to hear that gal recently passed away. Such a novel twist how it was a little old lady doing it the whole time! You'd never see that one coming.. She's so game for it in the scenes where she's grappling with the enchanting Adrienne King until she famously turns the tables and lops off her head in one legendary moment of gore! All of the gruesome effects still look really well done, Tom Savini did such excellent work. Very nice and cruel. Oh wait, let me explain. I've always found that it's okay to 'enjoy' the slaughter of this film series in that each death is like the punchline to a macabre joke, and then so begins the buildup to the next one.. It's something akin to the carnival game where you shoot the ducks that pop up! The scariest part for me is when the girl goes out into the storm after hearing a child's distant cry of ~""Help meeee!~ It gives me a chill every time I hear it. I don't like curtains being open at night. Somebody might be out in the dark, looking in. You can't see them, but they can see you. It really gives me the creeps. You never see her die, just hear her scream, and like when the annoying comic relief guy in the feather headdress is quietly finished off, I find it more unsettling when it's what you don't see, and your head fills in the rest! The cast speak fondly of their time working on the film and remember the good times they had, and I think that shows, it does have a certain enthusiasm about it. It kinda feels like this movie gets a free pass with me, forgiveness for all of its faults - because it's Friday the f*****g 13th man! It's such a romp, it always was. I think it's seminal horror viewing . There's a reason why this humble movie from 1980 with a cast of unknowns at the time, still lives on. It's suspenseful, it's funny and it's fun, and that jump scare with the boat at the end is one of the best in horror movie history! I'd like to see anything from today come close to such longevity. Most of those are forgotten on the way home from the cinema! An undeniable classic and essential for good spooky fun.",Friday the 13th

92,NateWatchesCoolMovies,The slasher prototype and a blast of gory atmospheric fun,10,27 October 2015,"31 Days Of Horror: Day 13One of the original slasher prototypes, Friday The 13th is a beloved halloween classic for me. I have hazy recollections of nerding out on the entire franchise (which is a big commitment, believe me) when I was younger, starting with this quaint, barebones entry. Fun fact: iconic Jason Voorhees doesn't even show up until the second film, and doesn't even find his legendary hockey mask until the third. It's his demented mommy Pamela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) who does the slicing and dicing here, on an unsuspecting bunch of soon to be (or not) camp counselors. It opens with a prologue set in the 50's, detailing the very first murders ever to be committed at Camp Crystal Lake, setting the POV tone (this movie is the king of POV shots) before fast forwarding to the 80's. The counselors arrive, and shirk their renovation duties as the director drives off into town for supplies. They goof off, get hammered and yes, engage in classic slasher movie teen sex, before being butchered one by one by an unseen Mrs. Voorhees. Makeup master Tom Savini supplies the gruesome FX, and a very young Kevin Bacon plays one of the unfortunate youngsters. Adrienne King, in one of the first incarnations of the 'final girl' archetype, is resilient as Alice. Like I've said before, atmosphere is very important here, and this one pioneers the slow, ambient buildup perfectly, punctuated by hazy interludes of forest and lake photography, accompanied by the creepy and surprisingly beautiful score. This is one corner of an integral triangle of slasher films (the other two are coming up as well) that forged an entire subgenre, an army of imitators, homages and spoofs, and a whole corner of horror culture all its own. A classic.",Friday the 13th
93,drownnnsoda,Slasher Classic That Started Off The '80s Horror Boom.,10,9 July 2004,"""Ki ki ki ki ma ma ma ma"". That's the famous trademark to the ""Friday the 13th"" series. This is probably one of my favorite 80's slashers, and none of the sequels it spawned (which is about 10 currently) are nearly as good. ""Friday the 13th"" is about a group of camp counselors who are left alone overnight to fix up the camp before its grand reopening. The teens are having fun and enjoying themselves, swimming, playing games, having sex, and just having a good time. But their good time comes to an end when a big storm hits that evening, and suddenly the teens begin to gruesomely die left and right. Who is killing off the teens at Camp Crystal Lake? Could it be Jason Voorhees, who drowned in the lake years ago? Or perhaps someone else? I wont say who the killer is, because it will ruin the whole movie if you haven't seen it, so I'll stop there.""Friday the 13th"" wouldn't appear to be a movie deserving of all the popularity that it received. Its overall storyline seems typical of its genre, with a bunch of worthless teenagers at the hands of a merciless killer. But this film is remembered as such a classic because it set off the domino-effect of the countless slasher movies that evolved from the '80s, many of them essential rip-offs. While the slasher-type story of ""Friday the 13th"" isn't unique, the twist in the end really sets it apart. The atmosphere is spooky, and the summer camp setting is perfect, plus that unforgettably eerie score adds to the film's energy. Also notable are the clever and disturbing ways that the characters are killed off, many of which have never been forgotten by genre fans. Acting-wise, it isn't amazing in the least, and the majority of our performers are mediocre at best. Adrienne King leads the cast competently, and you'll recognize a young Kevin Bacon as a camp counselor, along with Betsy Palmer as a prime example of a delusional psychopath.In my opinion this is the best movie of the series by far, the rest are just a bunch of rather cheap slasher films that were spawned consecutively after the success of the original, although they are still somewhat enjoyable on a corny-slasher flick kind of level. This movie has spawned ten sequels already if that tells you anything, but the first is still number one and I think it always will be. How can you get any better than this movie? This is the ultimate slasher movie in my opinion, and I'm having trouble deciding whether or not I like this better than ""Halloween"". I suppose this film is taken a little less seriously, but I think that makes it an even more fun film to watch. There are creative murders, a great setting, and one hell of an ending.Overall, ""Friday the 13th"" is the perfect movie to watch on a stormy summer night, because you are guaranteed to have a good time. It set the grounds for the uncountable number of slasher films that followed during the decade, and remains a prime example of what a good slasher movie is. This is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again and never really get tired of it. Sure, ""Friday the 13th"" may be a body count movie - but it's really the king of them all. A true must-see for horror fans, although if you consider yourself one, you've more than likely already seen it. 10/10.",Friday the 13th

The acting was less than satisfactory, it wasn't terrible, it's just that some of it was really cheesy at times. I did think that it took a little too long getting going, the best part was the last 40 minutes. That was when the screaming and offscreen killings and action happened. Some of the fighting and action was cheesy and kinda funny, it wasn't supposed to be though, so that's not good. At 1 point an axe rises behind a girl, and she has she the most laughable cheesy scream I've ever seen or heard, I was kinda annoyed by that, I just thought the actors could've done a lot better than that. I did enjoy Betsy Palmer's performance though. I did like that the killings occurred offscreen, so I didn't have to suffer through what most modern day horror movies do, meaning the constant full detail graphic horror violence.

97,JoeKarlosi,Friday the 13th (1980) ***,7,7 February 2009,"The one that started it all! This was the first in a (happily) never-ending franchise about a maniacal serial killer who stalks and splatters victims in a variety of inventive ways, and it's set at a long-abandoned camp just off Crystal Lake. In this debut film, a fresh group of teen-aged camp counselors attempt to fix up and resume business at the cursed campsite, where a young boy had drowned over twenty years earlier, followed by a string of unsolved murders. Despite the warnings of the old local town lunatic who warns them ""you're doomed!"", the naive youngsters are gradually slaughtered off one by one. ""Friday the 13th"" often gets special consideration in hindsight these days because it was the first in a long-running series that has persisted for nearly 30 years now (a brand new remake opens in a few days as of this writing!). It's a solid horror experience with several things to recommend in it, including: terrific gore effects by makeup maestro Tom Savini, a fun climax and ending, and an aura of mystery as to guessing the killer's identity. Harry Manfredini also deserves special praise for coming up with the chilling music soundtrack, which would be repeated in later sequels. *** out of ****",Friday the 13th

We don't see Jason till the endof the movie,, and Mrs. Vorhees till the very near end,, all in all i liked the movie,, but the sequels seem to pack a much better punch.",Friday the 13th
99,slokes,Camp Hack-N-Slash,6,13 July 2007,"While neither a great slasher film nor an interesting story, ""Friday The 13th"" retains much of the punch it had when first released, and gains a certain nostalgic camp appeal that keeps people coming back long after they have discovered its nasty surprises.It's Friday, June 13, and a small group of counselors at sleep-away Camp Crystal Lake are setting up for their formal opening two weeks hence. As night settles and they fool around, a shadowy presence infiltrates the camp and begins picking them off one by one. Apparently someone doesn't want the camp to open, only instead of restraining orders you get slit throats.""It's not bad enough to have a Friday the 13th,"" a cop tells the camp director. ""You've got to have a full moon, too.""""Friday The 13th"" does a few things very well, particularly with its serious moonlight, sinister woodsy atmosphere and stripped-down kills-and-chills aesthetic. You can really see this film the way you're supposed to just once, the first time, where it's possible to imagine the killer lurking in every shadow. After that, you can only sit back and admire the craft. Director Sean S. Cunningham and his team make excellent claustrophobic use of their real-life location (a lakeside sleepaway camp in New Jersey), and the brilliant ""Psycho""-derived score by Harry Manfredini never allows you a moment's repose, especially as we get two killings before the opening credits and very little letup thereafter.Many user reviews on this site properly describe ""Friday the 13th"" as a roller-coaster ride more than a serious film. Still, it's hard looking past the shallow characterization and inane dialogue. How does one play strip Monopoly? It would take two hours before someone took a sock off!The counselors are pretty interchangeable and hard to care about, i.e. pretty girls and stupid guys. Even a young Kevin Bacon fails to register, except for being Kevin Bacon. The only attention-getting thing he or any of his castmates manage to do is die, and while the build-up to their deaths is invariably effective, the actual murders tend to be rote and repetitive, at least those we see on screen.What makes ""Friday The 13th"" a solid, lasting work despite such limitations is the ending. Adrienne King and Betsy Palmer face off in a sustained sequence that makes up in sheer energy for what it lacks in rooting interest. The horror and suspense here are not only sharper, but elevated by a campy comic sensibility that makes rewatching this sequence tremendously enjoyable as we pick up on various layers, depth entirely missing from the rest of this production.SPOILER ALERT  The unveiling of Palmer as the film's killer will not catch anyone off-guard, especially after she introduces herself as Mrs. Voorhees. Many watching this sequence will be asking ""Where's Jason?"", being that Jason Voorhees is the franchise's famous slaughterer. Yet Jason is not needed here; his mother is more than enough, especially as Palmer plays her with the right amount of eye-blazing fearsomeness. It's a shame that after her vivid grisly death, Cunningham allows his film to putter out on a long, boring shot of King floating alone on a canoe, awaiting the arrival of police.  SPOILER ALERT ENDS.Like a roller-coaster ride, even if you don't enjoy the experience of ""Friday The 13th"" while enduring it firsthand, you will get a kick talking about it with your friends later.",Friday the 13th
100,fertilecelluloid,"A slasher from a more naive, innocent time in cinema history",6,23 November 2005,"My reaction when I first saw this during its theatrical release -- I saw it five times -- was unfettered enthusiasm. In particular, I loved the lake sequence at the end where mongoloid Jason springs improbably from the water to drag our heroine down into Crystal Lake's watery depths.Having recently revisited it, I found it quite fresh, even innocent.It's a different bird to its sequels because Jason may or may not exist. The film still leaves the fact of his existence ambiguous. The sequels don't. When the second part arrived, Jason was clearly a living (dead) force of destruction and revenge.Savini's effects are bloody and convincing and Cunningham's direction is adequate. Cunningham didn't show any serious talent until he directed ""The New Kids"", actually, but that's another matter and another review.With the exception of the lulling lake score at film's end, the music, for the most part, is rather clichéd, but it is also memorable. Performances are self-conscious and the cinematography is nothing to have fits about.Still, the film feels nostalgic now, a document of a more innocent, less complicated time. It's not mean-spirited and it's not pretentious. It's just a little slasher flick that surprised everybody, especially its makers.",Friday the 13th
101,Witchfinder-General-666,Classic Slasher has its Highs and Lows,5,7 May 2009,"Today, ""Friday the 13th"" is widely considered to be THE essential slasher flick of the 80s. It is doubtlessly a trend-setter, and even a classic of 80s Horror cinema, and therefore a film that every Horror fan should see at least once. That being said, I cannot deny that this is, in my opinion, slightly overrated by most of my fellow Horror lovers.After the ghastly murders of teenage camp staff in 1958, the summer camp 'Camp Crystal Lake', which is set lakeside in the middle of the woods, has been closed for 22 years. When a bunch of young people are try to re-open the camp, they have to find out that the maniac killer is still on the loose, craving for blood...On the one hand, the film is highly influential, suspenseful, overall quite atmospheric and it has some genuine shock moments. The remote Camp Crystal Lake in the middle of the forest is a wonderful setting for a slasher, and even the performances are above the average slasher flick. On the other hand, the story is overall pretty dull, and, if one is a bit more familiar with the Horror genre, the film is not quite that original after all. The slasher genre in general was strongly influenced by the (superior) Italian Giallo-genre (one of my favorite sub-genres in Horror), and this is particularly obvious with ""Friday the 13th"". The lakeside setting and even some of the murders were copied from master director Mario Bava's blood-soaked 1971 classic ""Reazione A Catena"" aka. ""A Bay of Blood"" (Bava would be my choice for THE greatest Horror director ever), other scenes bare strong resemblance to films like the Canadian slasher milestone ""Black Christmas"" of 1974. There is no doubt though, that ""Friday the 13th"" delivers some new aspects, however. Right after John Carpenter's 1978 genre classic ""Halloween"", this is doubtlessly number 2 on the list of the most influential American slasher flicks. The film delivers a special feeling, and even though it is no masterpiece in my opinion, I still enjoy it occasionally, having seen it many times before. Master Tom Savini provides great gore effects which guarantee interesting murder scenes. ""Friday the 13th"" spawned ten sequels, a remake and countless rip-offs so far, some of which are better than the original. While this isn't a masterpiece, or even a very good film, it is somewhat a classic of its own right. In case there are Horror fans who haven't seen it (which I doubt), I recommend doing so.",Friday the 13th
102,ferbs54,Kinda Draggy Till The Last 20 Minutes...,6,6 November 2007,"As the last person in the Western Hemisphere to see the hit 1980 slasher flick ""Friday the 13th"" for the first time (well, it's felt like that, anyway!), I suppose it falls on me to say some final words on the subject. Unless you've been comatose for the past 27 years now, you must know that this film shows us what happens when a group of randy teenage counselors goes to Camp Crystal Lake to prepare it for its first opening in 22 years, following a pair of unsolved murders--namely, a repeat of those murders, as the teens get sliced and diced one by one by an unseen killer. And this, it seems to me, is the picture's major flaw. The teens blithely go through their day, each one is dead before he/she practically knows it, no bodies are found, and thus no one ever seems really scared. And as the bulk of the movie takes place during a stormy night, many of these slayings occur in more than semidarkness. It is only in the picture's final 20 minutes, when the last teen standing (funny, I thought it would be Annie...the very FIRST to go!) finally realizes that something is amiss, that the film takes off and starts delivering anything like gripping suspense. I will admit that our first look at the killer (I'm being coy here, on the off chance that I am NOT the last person to have seen this) did take me by surprise, especially since I was expecting to see that darn hockey mask! A nice ""Psycho"" reversal in this final section leads to an admittedly tense finale. Still, for the most part, this picture drags, with many slow sections, and ultimately ""Friday the 13th"" turns out to be not bad, but certainly nothing great. It has spawned a ridiculous number of sequels at this point, but is there anyone out there who knows, or cares, if they've made ""Friday the 13th 13"" yet?",Friday the 13th
103,TOMNEL,I hardly consider this a classic.,6,30 December 2006,"For whatever reason the 80's had the mediocre slashers, followed by terrible sequels and this is one of them. The plot is a bunch of kids are at a camp where they get killed off one by one. So not very original for the plot. The acting was okay from a few main characters, but otherwise it's pretty bad acting. The gore effects are pretty good, but there wasn't really that much gore. I guess the reason this is thought of as a horror classic is because it spawned of 10 sequels and sold a billion hockey masks for Halloween. I found the other slashers from around this time, ""Halloween"" and ""a Nightmare on Elm Street"" to both be better films.

For 1980, it was the start of what would be the 80's 'slasher' genre in horror. The term: I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, would be repeated throughout the next 10 years. A very young Kevin Bacon stars in this low budget, independent movie that does justice to the ""camp / slasher"" movies of the 70's. The setting of the isolated town / camp grounds has become the perfect location for horror movies. Camp Cystal Lake is the Elm Street of Camp names that you do not want to send your children too.

105,Jonny_Numb,"a fairly unmemorable, yet entertaining rip-off",5,19 August 2003,"An unashamed cash-in on the highly overrated ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th"" was lucky enough to come out at a time when the 'market' for slasher flicks was practically non-existent, therefore it had the ability to turn its lack of inspiration into a successful horror franchise.  That being said, I never had much interest in the Ft13 series, but with the recent announcement that a theater out my way was going to be playing the original film, I decided to give it a look on video.  What this movie does have going for it is a remarkably fast pace (it takes place over the course of one day) and some impressive (if all too brief) gore effects from Tom Savini.  What the movie doesn't have is a single memorable character, or even a MAIN character--basically, a bunch of horny teens are picked off until only one remains, and you won't miss any of them.  The hyperactive Bernard Herrmann/Ennio Morricone-ripoff score detracts from the suspense rather than heightening it.  However, I was willing to dismiss this when, much to my surprise, director Sean S. Cunningham (who produced Wes Craven's ""Last House on the Left"") built some strong atmosphere and suspense in the last half of the film, leading to a creepy crescendo in which the last survivor takes on the insidious slasher (which has the ""Psycho"" complex reversed).  Effective when it wants to be, ""Friday the 13th"" is weak in the first half, strong in the last, but a generally lopsided horror flick.5/10",Friday the 13th
106,questl-18592,Friday Friday Gotta Get Down on Friday,7,29 December 2020,"I feel as though something magical happened with this movie. We'd hit the 40 year mark since it's initial release and I both hadn't seen it and, more incredibly, hadn't been spoiled on it. I'm sure at some point I must've heard what happens in this, it's an iconic film that helped create and define a genre and yet as I was watching it I hadn't the slightest clue.Anyhow, that aside, this was a fun enough watch. These 80s slasher flicks are usually pretty amusing for me and even if the tropes are played out now and horror has evolved blah blah blah, there's something to the simplicity here that I enjoy. It also gets points for playing it's cards close to the chest for the vast majority of the film rather than just giving it all away up front.This is definitely worth checking out if only for the significance it carries in the annals of film history. Friday the 13th, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm St. all deserve their place on the Mt. Rushmore of Slashers. I suppose the biggest question is how we go from this to Jason killing people in space but... Some questions are best left unanswered. Solid recommend for people interested in watching some of the formative genre films, and I think it's even worth a rent for everyone else when Halloween rolls around again.",Friday the 13th
107,aidanratesmovies,"Not great, but certainly worth seeing",7,15 April 2020,"A wonderfully shot, interesting, and provocative thriller- Friday the 13th may not be as scary as it thinks it is, but is certainly a worthwhile watch for horror fans alike. The film has many flaws, not doing much for its plot and feeling tedious at times throughout its short runtime. However, the film is mastefull on its own atmosphere, and if taken just a bit more time on the films tedious story, it feels like it could have become something truly special, and truly timeless. Instead, we get a messier version of an interesting concept, which, in all honesty, is better than it has any right to be. The actors in the film are surprisingly decent, even if their characters themselves are a bit shallow, they feel more real than ever in this dated kind of horror, and is quite refreshing to not see such blatant stereotypes in a horror film for once. The cinematography is astounding, and provides quite a unique glimpse into a world worth showing. The film is a bit frustrating by the center, but starts strong and ends provocatively. It's a bit of a messy ending, but one merited with some strengths, even if the foundation for them isn't quite strong itself. In the end, Friday the 13th is certainly not perfect, but certainly an underrated thriller that does have some quite good moments within its somewhat shallow frames.

108,mrdonleone,two parts of a detective horror movie,7,8 April 2009,"I'm going to try to defend this movie, using critical information and some connection with James Bond. so what's all this about a bad movie? and why do they say this is a horror movie? this is a typical whodunit. okay, the sequels could be called 'horror'. but this is really a good crime aka detective movie. but if I really had to complain about something, this movie is way too long. the first part I was so excited. no, not sexually aroused, but executed, like I would be if I should go to Walt Disney World again. yes, you understand. I was looking forward to see this cult movie again. but the length was too long, and this movies soon turned out to be something very boring. I went to have a bath. after wards, I watched the second part with new energy. the problem was that I already saw it in the past and I watched it back then to see gore. sorry folks, there's no gore in this movie. no bloody spectacles as in 'The Evil Dead' either. it's just a puzzle movie: can they find out who is the real murderer in time? are they all gonna die? is there something creepy about this incident? I am afraid that I'm going to spoil everything, but no: there's nothing creepy about this movie. and just for the record: if I would be in a situation where I see the rotting corpses of my friends all around me, I wouldn't scream at all.

110,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Slasher That Kicked Off A Beloved Franchise,9,8 May 2019,"To start this off, this film was not the first in the series that I saw. I actually didn't see this one until much later on one of the movie channels and I'm pretty Scream ruined the ending for me before I could see it. I still have a fondness for this film and series that was sparked from this. The synopsis is a group of camp counselors are stalked and murdered by an unknown assailant while trying to reopen a summer camp, which years before, was the site of a child's drowning.As the synopsis states, we start back in 1958. We see a couple of counselors making eyes at each other. They are Barry (Willie Adams) and Claudette (Debra S. Hayes). They go off to have sex when we get a POV shot. They are then both killed.We shift into what was the present at the time the film was made. There's a young woman, Annie (Robbi Morgan). She enters a town and heads for a diner. She asks for a ride to Camp Crystal Lake and she learns about the crush on it and its nickname, Camp Blood. Ennis (Rex Everhart), gives her a ride, and tells her more about the story. He drops her off at a crossroads.The film then shifts to a group of teens. Ned (Mark Nelson) is driving along with Marcie (Jeannine Taylor) and her boyfriend Jack (Kevin Bacon). They make it to the camp and meet the owner, Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer). Already there is Alice (Adrienne King) who appears to have a thing with Steve. There is also Bill (Harry Crosby) and Brenda (Laurie Bartram). They are getting it ready before the camp opens in two weeks. Steve has to go into town and leaves them to keep working.Annie never makes it to camp as someone starts to pick them off one by one. The person is driving the same vehicle as Steve. Things become more complicated when a heavy storm rolls in as well.Now I will warn anyone reading this is that I won't spoil the ending or who the killer is, even thought I'm assuming that most everyone reading this knows who it is. As I said, Scream and just pop-culture in general kind of make it hard to not know who the killer is, but I will get back to that shortly.With that out of the way, I will say that this film has a pretty solid story. I have read that the creators of this film were ripping off Halloween. I can see the similarities between the two. This films though actually plays more like a giallo than a slasher though. The killer has a solid reason for doing the killings. I also enough the idea they've lost their grip with reality over the grief they are dealing with. I think placing this in at a camp out in the middle of nowhere is great. You are creating isolation and make it even worse by having a storm keeping them inside.I don't mind the reveal, my issue with it though is that I think the character should have been introduced into the film at some point. That is where it hurts it as being a giallo and kind of a cheat overall. This is really my only drawback on the story, but a lot of it was that the even the writer didn't know who the killer would be at first. Going even farther than that, it makes it a bit implausible with some of the things that are done when we see who the killer is.As for the pacing of the film, I think they did a good job. It really gets into it and then keeps you hooked with kills throughout. That really picks up to a climax once the storm starts. I will get into my issues with some of the deaths in a bit, but I do think that it really does make the film tension. I did like the ending of the film, even though I could have done without the last jump scare at the end. It is important to the overall franchise though.The acting in this film is surprisingly good for most of the relatively unknown actors and actresses in this film. What makes this film one of the better slashers out there is that we actually get to meet these characters. It doesn't focus too long on each one, but we still get enough to connect with them. I haven't brought her name yet, but Betsy Palmer is in this film and I thought she did a solid job in her role. King is good as the reserved, normal teen that shows her fear as the tension ramps up. We get to see a young Bacon and I thought the women in this film weren't bad looking, especially Taylor. I thought overall the cast was good and rounded out the film for what was needed.Next I want to touch on the effects. They were done by Tom Savini and he did great. This film has some good on screen kills. What is impressive is how real they look. The blood was realistic as well as how they are killed. I did have an issue with the amount of kills off-screen though. I'm wondering how much of that was censorship and how much was budgets. To be a good slasher, we need to see these.This brings me to the soundtrack of the film. I liked that Harry Manfredini's score builds tension and really ramps it up. I also like that there is no music until the killer is around. It changes the feel of the scene. He uses some eerie sounds as well and the iconic breathing that everyone who knows the series does as well.Now with that said, I would recommend this classic. This film really helped to get the slasher craze going even though this one plays more like a giallo. This film created one of the best horror franchises and ended up birthing one of the best on-screen killers. The story of the film is good. The acting is done well, despite most of the being unknown. The effects were great, but I do wish more of the deaths were on screen. The score is as well. The editing of the film builds tension until a satisfying payoff. I just wish we would have met the killer before the reveal, but I won't hold that against this film too much. I do almost feel this film would have been better to be a one-off, but I do love the franchise overall. I would recommend this film to fans of horror and non-horror fans alike. This one is definitely a classic and this film worth at least a viewing.",Friday the 13th
111,a_chinn,Weak first entry in overrated horror franchise,3,27 May 2017,"Ch Ch Ch Ah Ah Ah. Harry Manfredini's iconic score is here for this first entry in the long running iconic (and overrated) slasher film franchise, but this is also the only film in which (SPOILER ALERT) Jason is not the killer and the killer is his mother. Mrs. Voorhees spends most of the film as a camera POV, exacting her revenge over her son's death by a group of camp counselors who were too busy with each other to notice her son drowning. The entire Friday the 13th franchise is pretty weak and none of the films are particularly memorable. What is memorable about the franchise is the hulking, unstoppable villain Jason Voorhees, who is completely absent from the film, unless you count the body of boy appearing at the very end. Jason does return as the killer in the second film, but he wears a gunny sack over his head, ALA ""The Town that Dreaded Sundown,"" instead of his iconic hockey mask, which wouldn't make it's first appearance until the third film, which I suppose was when the franchise started proper. But back to this film in particular, it's poorly directed by Sean S. Cunningham, with hardly any suspense or scares, but it does feature a couple familiar faces with Betsy Palmer and Kevin Bacon, along with well done gory special effect by Tom Savini, so I suppose that makes the film at lease watchable. Overall, this is a weak film that kicked off an iconic (though weak) horror franchise. Stick with ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" or even the Chucky films over this franchise.",Friday the 13th
112,Samiam3,"Very scary, but not quite a masterpiece",7,7 June 2009,"Controversy aside, Friday the 13th is an accomplished horror film, but not a masterpiece. Like George Romero did with 'Night of the Living Dead', director Sean Cunningham proves that money is not required to make an entertaining film, unfortunately acting is. In Friday the 13th, most of the cast deliver their lines like they had a minute to rehearse, and what is even more awkward is that the worst actor in the film is the protagonist. This problem comes down hard on the climax, but until that part, Friday the 13th is very freaky fun.Terror is about to strike for a handful of hapless teenage counselors who are re-opening camp Crystal Lake for the Summer. It is a place that the locals say is cursed. Ever since the drowning of young Jason Voorhees thirty years earlier, the camp has witnessed a variety of deaths and disasters. There is more coming. The brilliant thing about Friday the 13th, is how little we know of the danger. In Jaws for example, we know that a shark is the antagonist, but we never see it. Friday the 13th takes this idea a step further. We the viewers do not have the slightest idea of who is murdering these kids one at a time in progressively bloody ways. Unfortunately as the characters decrease in number so does the quality of the picture. The climax is a showdown between our unheroic protagonist and our psycho killer. You probably know from others sources who that is, but I won't say. All I can tell you is that this part of the movie is badly played out.Like I said, Friday the 13th is not a masterpiece, but it is definitely good enough to make you want to try the next film. You'll be eager to find out more about this little drowned boy Jason and how he became one of the most frightening images in horror.",Friday the 13th
113,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The best knockoff of Halloween (1978),7,16 May 2014,"It's fairly obvious that with the success of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), that more people would be attempting to make films in that particular genre. Here audiences witness director Sean S. Cunningham dish out his first actual film that everyone remembers even though, this isn't his first time directing. However, what makes this film feel painstakingly similar to that Halloween (1978) is the whole concept in general. Screenwriter Victor Miller even stated himself that he was just riding the coat tales of John Carpenter's movie. Surprisingly though, as much as this sounds like it could be bad, it actually isn't.The story runs along the same lines as every other slasher horror film - a group teenagers are stalked and picked off by a mysterious killer. However, this time it takes place in a campsite, not suburbia. Also, the fact of how the story plays out is still respectable despite being sampled from Halloween (1978). This allows the movie to stand on it's own without coming up too much as a copycat. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the whole story is the mysterious background surrounding the camp. The real name of the camp is called Camp Crystal Lake, but the folks who live nearby call it Camp Blood. Gee, that sounds real ominous. However, it's not only this aspect but the tragic story of a boy who drowned there as well.Starring in this movie are a bunch of no name actors and one who would become real popular among fans. The one everyone knows of now is Kevin Bacon. The rest would either drop out completely of film or continue for a little and then fade away. What's with these actors? There are too many films where convincing actors star in an entertaining film and then drop out completely after that film was released. The two actors I wish had continued their careers were Robbi Morgan as Annie and Jeannine Taylor as Marcie. Along with them are convincing performances by the other unknown actors. Betsy Palmer is probably the most convincing due to her character's mentality.For violence, gore fans should be relatively satisfied. It still is not the over-the-top actions that one would see in today's slasher movies, but it delivers; perhaps some moments viewers may not expect. I know there was one scene I didn't see coming. One aspect to the film that helps it stand on its own is the cinematography by Barry Abrams. Throughout the daylight parts of the film, Abrams captures a lot of good shots of the nature surrounding the camp. Adding to that is composer Harry Manfredini's score. If there's one thing that Manfredini got right, it's the whispering voices throughout the running time. It helps give the setting a very ghostly feel. Music wise, Manfredini relies more on screeching strings and not creating actual tunes. It isn't all too effective in most places, but there are times where he does create a tune here and there. It's just not often enough. This is still an entertaining film.It certainly is not the newest of concepts considering that it took much of its premise from Halloween (1978), but it's atmosphere and story are interesting enough that it shouldn't be turned down.

If we consider this film for nowadays, we are obviously going to think it's just like tons of other horror movies such as ""Identity"", ""Ghost Ship"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and many others. But we have to analyze it as a 1980 movie which is full of originality and innovation. And don't get me wrong, but the creepy soundtrack they used in past is much more scary than nowadays'. Furthermore, it made its job, entertained the audience with a creepy atmosphere, despite looking so amateurish in the fight between Mrs. Voorhees and Alice. Also the last scare in the river was truly unexpected, bottoms up for the director in here.",Friday the 13th
115,justin-fencsak,Filmed in my old hometown of Blairstown!!!,10,13 September 2019,"When I first started to watch this movie back in the summer of 1998 as I approached 16 years old, i was scared to death and enjoyed the film as pure horror escapism. Little did I know that when i moved to where they shot the movie, I knew some of the locations from the movie!!! I later saw all of the movies save for Jason Goes to Hell, hated Jason X, hated the remake, but loved when Jason met Freddy!! I also loved playing the online videogame where you play as either Jason or one of the campers from the original series. The music is iconic as well as the cast. Jason doesn't appear in this movie at all, he's only a young child and the killer is his mom. He would return in part 2 and then don the hockey mask in part 3, the only 3d installment of the franchhise and the first one to open on a friday the 13th against the 1982 reissue of Star Wars.

116,alexanderdavies-99382,The first of an entire franchise.,7,7 September 2017,"In itself, this first ""Friday the 13th"" film is pretty good to be fair. I can't claim to be the biggest fan of these films. However, I haven't seen all that many of them so I'm reserving my final analysis. At the resort known as Crystal Lake, two murders take place during a flashback scene in 1958. Two youngsters are slain whilst unleashing their hormones and how! After being unable to withstand the negative press and publicity over the tragedy, the resort closes up until over 20 years later. The killings soon occur all over again, thanks to another group of holiday makers who stay at Crystal Lake. There is a fair degree of mystery as to the identity of the killer and also regarding the motive. All is revealed within about the last 20 minutes. The setting is a restricted one but that works to the films advantage. The direction by Sean Cunningham is very good and he sustains the suspense effectively. The cast aren't actors to speak of, they are just going through the motions. Betsy Palmer does well when she makes an appearance near the end. The producer needed someone with a little bit of name value, so as to give ""Friday the 13th"" any chance of box office success. Betsy Palmer was that person. A young Kevin Bacon makes one of his first film appearances as one of the new holiday makers. I recall my expectations of wanting to see the first appearance of the killer Jason Voorhees. When he didn't appear, I remember feeling disappointed. That feeling is still there when I see this movie. You can't mention any of the ""Friday the 13th"" films without mentioning Voorhees, he is the glue that holds the films together. Without him, there would be no marketing value whatever. Luckily, from the second film onwards, it would be different.",Friday the 13th
117,PredragReviews,Always beware of Crazy Ralph...,8,20 April 2016,"Friday the 13th has become so famous and huge that you don't even have to have seen the films to know who the killer in the series is (for the most part). With its everlasting sequels and recent remake/reboot/re-imagining of the series it doesn't show much signs of stopping anytime soon. Granted they may not be the best horror films in the world (not by a long shot) but there is something about them that people just can't resist and keep coming back for the newest release. It's safe to say that these movies are here to stay until they don't make enough money.The first theme that Friday the 13th throws in your face is the idea of isolated mass hysteria. Camp Crystal Lake and the town of Crystal Lake are haunted. They are not haunted by ghosts and goblins, but by unsuppressed dark memories of a little boy drowning and a string of unsolved murders among other things, in which all have to do with Camp Crystal Lake. Every person in town believes that there is a ""Death Curse"" upon the camp, and they refer to the place as ""Camp Blood."" When Annie walks into the restaurant and asks some people how she can get to Camp Crystal Lake, they all look at her and two people try to warn her to stay away from the place. They say the place is jinxed and has a death curse. The killings, for early 80's, are quite inventive - an ax through the head, an arrow through the neck, and lots of fun at the archery range are just a few of the treats in store. Effects were good because the master Tom Savini was just getting his shoes muddy and honing his skills.All in all Friday the 13th is a powerful tragic but frightening story of love, loss, superstition, and murder with an ending that is sure to make one jump (no pun intended) right out of one's seat.Overall rating : 8 out of 10.",Friday the 13th
118,Sandcooler,Crazy old man blues,8,3 January 2006,"Sean S. Cunningham, your friendly neighbourhood producer, basically just ripped of earlier slashers, but though a whole bunch of things are just stolen from ""Halloween"", I still see this movie as pretty creative. It did also create a really influential subgenre: the summer camp slasher. How many knock-offs does this thing have anyway, copying ""Friday"" seems like the inevitable last resort for every untalented director out there. Either way, you know the drill, a couple of young people go to a summer camp for well, doesn't matter what reason, as long as they get killed. The townspeople warn them that the camp is not safe, they always assume it has some kind of curse. Apparently a killer is just too far-fetched for them. The young people naturally never believe them, go anyway, and then some mysterious shape in the dark picks them of one by one. During this whole process, we see nudity and gore at random intervals. It's really quite a brilliant concept. This one doesn't even do it best,but it is the first so kudos on that. It gives me a really warm feeling, it's the simple charm of an arrow through the neck. It's pretty much a classic.",Friday the 13th
119,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake,8,17 August 2013,"I'm going to comment on this one from a different perspective, one which most reviewers cannot comprehend: I will attempt to comment on the film itself, not retrospectively comment about the lengthy series of sequels it spawned, or its subsequent rip offs, or its later influence on the horror genre. I'll avoid the clichés about ""the one that started it all!""etc. Follow me? Camp Crystal Lake, the site of the drowning death of a young boy, several fires, and a double murder, for which it earned the nickname Camp Blood, has been closed for decades, and is now being renovated in an attempt to reopen it and turn it back into an idyllic summer getaway. Ramblings of the town drunk, Crazy Ralph, that the new group working there are all ""doomed"" go ignored. When a series of murders begin during a torrential rainstorm on the title date, who is responsible? Is it Crazy Ralph, seemingly always prowling the campgrounds, after all? Or another unseen psycho killer? Well made on its low budget ($550.000) , film has a brilliant, old fashioned soundtrack: violins screeching at key moments in the action, just as Psycho did twenty years earlier. One of the most memorable and effective uses of soundtrack on film I can think of. The girls are cute without being overly pretty (artificial or superficial) and the guys joke around without being complete asses.Even when characters are outside at the lake, or in the woods, film still has a claustrophobic feel, the action taking place in tight, intimate corners. The thick woods prevent them from getting very far away. The torrential nighttime rainstorm only seals them in tighter, making escape almost impossible.Truck driver Enos, gives Annie, and the audience, a well done exposition, without being too obvious about it. It really does seem like he is just telling the girl so she'll be aware of what happened- and maybe dissuade her from going to work at Camp Blood, rather than just obviously telling the audience what has happened. Annie's subsequent stalking and death scene, all in broad daylight, is a highlight.Many people railed against this slightly sleazy film's paper thin plot, but this first in a now lengthy series was only intended to shock and show gore effects, not have any moving or profound storyline, or be glitzy and glamorous. They weren't trying to do Shakespeare In The Park. The object was to scare the audience and make them jump out of the seats. The sinister, evil villain succeeds in doing that throughout, and then, when we find out who the killer really is, had to be a bit of a shock upon its release. But I'm certain someone will say that it ""looks like it was added at the last minute"" The final shock twist at the end, Jason's brief cameo, lunging out of the water to grab the lone survivor was an inspired bit, which the screenwriter allegedly didn't like.(The title comes forward from the right hand side of screen to the left, but when it hits the pane of glass, the glass shatters forward, instead of falling to the left.The trailer reveals several characters' deaths, and reverses that: the title comes from the back left side of the screen toward the right front of the screen, smashes into a pane of glass- but the glass falls from the right side of the screen to the left.)",Friday the 13th
120,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Strangely boring and sometimes toothless in retrospect, the original ""Friday the 13th"" is really only notable for starting off a long-running and much beloved franchise.",5,11 August 2016,"I'll always have a soft-spot in my heart for the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. Especially as an 80's baby/90's kid who grew up in a pop- culture environment where the psychotic hockey-masked killer Jason was known and loved by pretty much everyone... even kids like me who didn't see the films until we were older and only vaguely knew what they were about thanks to the whisperings and hints of our older siblings who were actually allowed to see the movies. (Usually renting them 2 or 3 at a time on trusty old VHS from the local Video King to watch after we younger brothers and sisters went to bed.)At the time this review is being posted, the franchise has been running strong for well over 35 years. Boasting 10 films in its original continuity, the fabulously entertaining (and dopey as heck) cross- over spin-off ""Freddy VS Jason"", a somewhat underrated reboot in 2009 and a planned new film due out sometime within the next year or two. But even a franchise so huge has to start with a small, humble beginning. Before the fame. Before the recognition. Before the birth of the pop-culture idol that the series spawned.Yes, it all started with a teeny-tiny production back in 1980- the original ""Friday the 13th.""It's almost impossible to really discuss this film critically without delving into spoiler territory (which I try to avoid in my reviews), though I will try my hardest to do so.The film revolves around a group of young Camp Counselors who are prepping the infamous Camp Crystal Lake for a reopening about 20 years after a mysterious double-murder and a tragic drowning involving a young child. However, it appears someone isn't exactly a happy camper and doesn't want Crystal Lake back in business, and this mysterious figure begins to pick off our protagonists one-by- one until a tense climax reveals the dreaded truth...It's no surprise at all that the film is essentially a glorified rip-off of the iconic slasher-horror that is John Carpenter's ""Halloween."" Director/Producer Sean S. Cunningham has been pretty candid about essentially wanting to create his own ""roller-coaster"" version of the Carpenter Classic with this film. Heck, they had ads and posters in the paper before the script was even written.But the problem I really have with the film is that it all feels so routine. Even often boring and sometimes toothless. While it may not be fair to judge it by modern standards, even for its time, it just doesn't have that much going for it. (Especially as the very same year of release, such classics as ""The Shining"" and the underrated ""The Changeling"" were chilling audiences to the bone.) It's a very aimless, meandering film, with sloppy plotting and far too much focus placed on seemingly-pointless sequences for it to attain the ""roller-coast"" feeling the director was going for. The first half of the film is just too much a chore to slog through. And once the horror finally kicks in, it's just the same rinse-and-repeat formula scene-after-scene, with really only a few gruesome deaths here and there to pique audience interest. All those old clichés and tropes that even at the time had become slightly predictable.Now, I know what you're saying- those are the things people love about these flicks. The clichés and the gore-galore. But it's so slowly paced and messy in this movie, it's hard to really get into it. It really isn't until the plethora of sequels that the formula is established and the pacing is tightened enough for those clichés and tropes to finally become fun and entertaining.As it stands, ""Friday the 13th"" does have its place in horror royalty. But I firmly believe it's more for spawning the long- running franchise that followed and less for the quality of the film itself.Oh, and I guess it's also kinda famous for introducing some guy named Kevin Bacon as a supporting character... but I'm not sure if he actually went anywhere after this. (Please appreciate the obvious sarcasm there. I loves the Bacon!)""Friday the 13th"" gets a middle-of-the-road 5 out of 10 from me. It's worth seeing because of its important part in the history of the overall franchise.

The motivation for the killings is speculative because of the camerawork - an unknown deranged slayer. It could be that they are driven by the immoral actions of the antagonist's victims, or their own rage. Gratuitous violence runs coarsely against the carefree innocence of young adults depicted. It is notable that the film subverts the tradition of the filmic murderer profile, but it isn't something to especially value.

The acting is decent and I love the soundtrack. It isn't all that original and it had a number of other movies stealing the camp killer idea (the Burning and Sleepaway Camp), but still, Friday the 13th manages to be entertaining all the way through.

125,rivertam26,An undeniable classic,8,6 March 2020,"*SPOILERS AHEAD*This review is for the unrated cut which has a touch more glorious Savini gore. It's crazy to think how this franchise started. Because when most of us think of it, we refer to the incomparable Hockey mask clad Jason Voorhees whose only in the movie a smidge and not in the form we most know him. The killer is Mrs. Voorhees played amazingly by Betsy Palmer. As we all know she targets the group of counselors trying to reopen the camp blaming them for the death of her son and judging them with brimstone and fire morals. She slices and dices them in increasingly impressive ways from sexy Kevin Bacons throat piercing to his girlfriend getting an axe in the face and so much more. It all culminates with her glorious beheading and one of the best jump scare endings of all time, if not the best. Revisiting it all these years later it's easy to see the film's many imperfections but also see why it spawned a 12 film franchise with a 13th hopefully on the way. It's formula of suspenseful atmosphere and gruesome quick kills is something almost every horror film has replicated in various degrees, some better and some worse.

The finale, Mrs. Voorhees and the confrontation with Alice, is more than satisfying, even if it is leaning heavily on 'Psycho', including the soundtrack. Betsy Palmer delivers a great performance for an iconic killer, without wanting to deny the rest of the cast any credit - all very natural and spontaneous. What else is there to say about this classic? Nothing much, really.

127,dunmore_ego,Lucky Number 13.,4,20 November 2009,"This might not be the original Stupid Knife-Kill Movie (HALLOWEEN holds that crown) - but it's definitely one of the stupidest. Director Sean S. Cunningham has a lot to answer for...Six teen camp counselors at Camp Crystal Lake, busy re-opening it after a tragedy years ago, are killed one by one on Friday the 13th.Movie opens on Friday 13, 1958, as two camp counselors (and I do mean 'camp') get knife-stuck while a boy drowns. Apparently, they should have been watching him instead of playing patticake. Then again, he shouldn't have been out swimming at night like an idiot. Which informs us on what kind of maniacs he and his mother are for condoning that unsafe behavior in the first place. Flash forward...TEXT: Present Day. Gee, I hope not. Those hairstyles alone would never get me laid. We're at the tail end of the rock 'n roll lifestyle of the 70s: bellbottoms, frizzed 'do's and chicks with that ""70s wench"" idiom of flat bellies and flatter chests. Back when CPR was called mouth-to-mouth, back when a snake in your room meant Kill First, return it to nature later, if it's not too dead; back when padding a movie with people making coffee and cleaning their teeth was called tension; when a girl getting down to her bra and panties meant she was going to die in a few minutes screaming irritatingly.Under the hippie eye of Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer), the counselors arrive and remake the camp against the warnings of a crazy old coot claiming the place is cursed, Ralph, who says he's a messenger from God, ""If you stay you're doomed!"" (Then again, if it's just someone slashing people, it's not really a ""curse,"" it's a lunatic with a knife. So much for trying to attach biblical portent to your film, Cunningham.) Suddenly, lo - The Bacon! Young Kevin Bacon as Jack (you will only see him younger in ANIMAL HOUSE). And though you will never see any of the other untalented cast ever again (all disappearing from cinema as if knife-killed), at least they can say they're ONE DEGREE from Kevin Bacon! The innumerable sequels this movie spawned make the world erroneously believe Friday THE 13TH is a movie worth having sequels for. But it was a cult movie then and it's a cult movie still. It has its laudatory moments: the distinction of popularizing the point-of-view killer skulking in the darkness; the final scenes of serenity shattered by one of the world's greatest jump scares; and Harry Manfredini's music is still eerie stuff (just what the hell is making that ""cheh cheh cheh... chih chih chih"" sound?).But even the filmmakers admitted to tossing off Friday THE 13TH as a quick buckmaker - mainly for those uncreative dorks who derive pleasure from watching ferocious unmotivated homicides; for that niche of rednecks who enjoy cousin-dipping and hatchet-killing, drinking their own pee in marmalade jars.Guess there are more rednecks out there than anyone imagined.Thankfully, the most annoying bad actor (Mark Nelson) is the first to die. Sadly, The Bacon goes soon after. The last person left alive, who escapes the maniac's knife, is Alice (Adrienne King), who, ironically, can't act to save her life.Up to that point, we only see the killer as a Point-Of-View shot. Now, wide-eyed Mrs. Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) makes up for her offscreen time by chewing the hell out of her on screen time until her overacting causes Alice to escape, as she insists on going Bond-Villain and filling in the backstory of how her precious son, Jason drowned in Crystal Lake, which started her vendetta against all camp counselors. Sounds logical. In an upside down version of PSYCHO, the dead boy talks through his mother, Mrs. Voorhees speaking to herself, ""Kill her mommy!"" So after displaying her deadly efficient, silent killing skills throughout the movie, suddenly Voorhees can't shutup and simply knife this last irritating screaming blonde. Maybe cos Alice was still fully dressed - see, that's why you have to get the blondes down to their bra and panties.This movie might have retained at least a mediocre rating, but it lost me during the strip-Monopoly game, where a girl gets down to her bra and panties (what a shock!) and then decides to call it a night. Instead of putting her clothes back on to walk out in the rain, she puts a raincoat over her bra and panties and steps out into the tempest! I'm sure I saw a KILL ME sign on the back of the raincoat...The hockey-masked, machete-carrying Jason Voorhees has become an iconic horror staple over the years and over four thousand billion sequels, but for the record, in this film, there were no hockey masks, no machetes - and no Jason! Goes to show that with a nothing film with nothing plot and nothing actors (excepting The Bacon!), for the filmmakers, 13 was truly a lucky number.",Friday the 13th
128,KUAlum26,Bears only some resemblance to the franchise to which it gave birth,7,1 June 2007,"While this movie will not be considered a pioneer film in the slasher genre(that distinction would probably go toward LAst House on the Left,Halloween,Evil Dead,Nightmare on Elm Street or even Final Destination),this movie and the series of films which sprang forth from it certainly etched its name on the pantheon of blood-letting,teen killing filmdom.The story is pretty well-known by now: ""Cursed"" Camp Crystal Lake is being re-opened after being shut down for nearly twenty years.Not surprisingly,nearly all of the counselors there are bumped off,one grizzly,sanguine way after another,and it's up to a lone,seemingly virginal survivor to confront and destroy the killer. As per films of this genre,while the hero(in this case,heroine)may've ended the killing spree in this story,the evil may not in fact be eradicated,only dormant for a future batch of unwitting victims.For the most part,this film works almost in spite of itself. The acting is wooden(the only viable actors in this show,Kevin BAcon and Betsy Palmer,are either made as an afterthought or as a scenery chewing expository character,in that order),the dialog is rendered nearly un-usable and some of the action sequences seem forced or awkward. Yet the element of suspense,terror,sheer dread(much of that from the sparse music score employed) and even vague titillation keeps this film just believable enough to make the events that transpire seem doable and chilling. Director Sean S. Cunningham,with a script from Victor Miller,starts a storyline of the Voorhees family and Camp Crystal LAke that is intriguing enough that it becomes a real shame that the ensuing movies--and while I haven't seen most of them full-through,I have seen enough of and read up on all of them to know how they turn out and what plot twists(if any)were offered--up until 1993's Jason Goes to Hell seemed to drift further and further away from the real ""curse"" of the camp nicknamed by the locals as ""Camp Blood"" and more toward new and more memorable ways of offing characters in each film.Besides the chanting theme of the killer(Ki-Ki-Ki MA-MA-MA)and the general backdrop of the film,it seems like this movie plays more like a skeletal murder mystery than a run-of-the-mill teen slasher flick. Fans of the series might be turned off by the lack of Jason Voorhees's presence in this film(At least physically),but most casual viewers will at least appreciate(IF they're up for it)the attempt at original scary movie built around some very familiar concepts. If you are not into camping(And I sure can't say that I am)and you like a cheap rent to watch with friends on a late night,I recommend this.",Friday the 13th
129,capkronos,Camp Crystal Lake nostalgia.,7,16 March 2009,"I was just a toddler when this hit theaters (where it became a surprise box office smash hit), so I didn't get to see it on the big screen and had to wait until the later part of the decade to see in on video. But boy did it ever make a lasting impression on me - especially that now-famous ending, which sent me (then 9 years old) literally jumping about five feet back from my TV set in horror. And that's one of the great things about the horror genre; its ability to bring out strong emotions in viewers and make a lasting impression, especially when they're viewed at an age when one is young and impressionable. To many of us, FT13TH now sits as a gory, though strangely enough, pleasantly nostalgic film that takes us back to a time when things were simpler and we still actually could be scared. I personally credit this film, along with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and PSYCHO, as being the films that created an ever-lasting love for the genre that I still hold to this day. Is it a great film? Perhaps not. It's technically flawed in many regards. However, it remains an entertaining film, and its influence cannot be denied. In short, it deserves its place in history as a horror classic despite its shortcomings.Everyone knows the story front and back by now, so there's really no reason to go into much detail about it. You have a group of counselors (led by Adrienne King) showing up to reopen a secluded summer camp and each falling victim to a killer whose identity is kept secret until about the last 20 minutes or so. The psycho turns out to be unhinged Mrs. Voorhees (memorably played by Betsy Palmer), out to avenge the death of her beloved son Jason, who drowned twenty or so years earlier because counselors were too busy making love to keep an eye on him. The film utilizes the same format (POV stalking, followed by a kill) for the duration of its run time and many of the murders actually take place off screen, though Tom Savini's makeup effects are as effective today as they were when this was first released. We get an arrow pushed up through the neck, an axe to the face, an arrow to the eye, a decapitation and other bloody scenes that do still pack a punch. Harry Manfredini's now-classic score solidifies the deal. The cast is comprised of mostly inexperienced actors (other than Palmer and a then-unknown Kevin Bacon), but they aren't nearly as bad as some try to make them out to be. And while the film doesn't provide much in the way of characterization, at least most of the characters in this film are upbeat and seem like fairly nice, normal people you wouldn't mind being around, which is more than what I can say for the myriad sequels, rip-offs and remakes that would come out later on. Having recently watched the 2009 ""reboot"" recently, which was full of moronic, obnoxious, stoners, sluts and hicks, and second-long CGI flashes in place of old school gore/prosthetic effects, I can say without hesitation that the original is actually looking better than ever before.",Friday the 13th

131,Maciste_Brother,"A classic, in spite of itself!",8,7 August 2003,"I consider Friday THE 13TH a classic, despite everything seemingly going against it. Yes, the original Friday THE 13TH part 1 and part 2 owe a lot to BAY OF BLOOD (or TWITCH OF DEATH NERVE). There's no question about it. The similarities between the two films are obvious. The film is responsible for spawning an endless number of truly awful sequels. The acting is nothing spectacular. The script is barely there. And the film sorta drags a bit in the middle. And the ending of Friday THE 13TH is an indirect rip-off of the ending in CARRIE. But the backwoods atmosphere/mystique behind Friday THE 13TH is totally original and effective (much more than any of the sequels), and the ending of FT13 is, imo, WAY better than the ending of CARRIE. The ending of FT13 makes the movie. The entire FT13 series exists merely on the strength of that ending. It created a myth, in the name of Jason. The story (or script) is wonderfully absurd (when you think about it) which gives the murders an even more psychotic edge to them, and in my mind, are more effective than the ones in BAY OF BLOOD or in any other Friday THE 13TH sequels because of the kooky reasoning behind them. Watching Jason kill his victims in the sequels quickly got boring. And the fact that Tom Savini created the excellent gory FX is a definite plus. The acting is average (some of it even poor) but let's face it, the characters, aside from their individual death scenes, don't have a lot of dramatic things to do, except for Betsy Palmer and Adrienne King, who is good but is not the best ""last surviving female"" actress ever to appear in a slasher. On the other hand, Betsy Palmer is amazing as Mrs. Voorhees. She's a combination of total sweetness, insanity and camp all rolled into one. Once Betsy appears on screen the film is thrilling and she adds a lot of life (no pun intended) to the whole proceeding, which was lacking from a good part of the film. And let's not forget the good score. Very effective even if it sometimes sounds derivative. And the original poster is great!The funny thing about Friday THE 13TH is that when I first saw it 20 years ago I thought it was good but not as good as HALLOWEEN. Fast forward 20 years, and today I sorta prefer Friday THE 13TH slightly more than HALLOWEEN now, which has lost a lot of its luster, due mainly to HALLOWEEN's awful sequels and their stupid story-lines. Artistically, HALLOWEEN is still the better film of the two. There's no comparison there. But it has lost its edge, while FT13's trashiness has oddly kept it fresh. While HALLOWEEN has irremediably lost a lot of its mystique with each subsequent sequels, Friday THE 13TH, on the other hand, actually gained more credibility with every release of its seemingly endless number of ultra-stupid sequels. After seeing some of those sequels, the original FT13 looks positively brilliant compared to those horrendous sequels. It's a classic in its own special way.",Friday the 13th
132,TheUnknown837-1,I didn't see anything on the screen to make me understand how an entire franchise was to grow out of it,5,15 April 2011,"The horror genre is a field of filmmaking regular dumped upon by people in general, which I think is unfair. Horror films can be very good. John Carpenter's iconic 1978 thriller ""Halloween"" was good. Horror films can even be art. That's what I would categorize Jonathen Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" under. But it's kind of obviously why the genre is so heavily lambasted. When people see a bad action movie, they dismiss it and move on without giving it too much thought. When they see a bad horror movie, it sort of sets a trademark for the entire genre. Especially when it gives birth to a franchise and a remake, as ""Friday the 13th"" did.Having seen the original 1980 ""Friday the 13th"" directed by Sean S. Cunningham and having given it an unbiased critique, I must confess something: I did not see anything - anything at all - that would make me believe that anybody would have liked it so much to have wanted to see an entire saga grow out of it. I'm told the movie hasn't aged well and its quote-unquote power has been run down by its imitators and followers, but I can't imagine it having had much at all to begin with. It's just so incredibly dull and derivative.We all know the story. Some horny, cigarette-chugging teenagers are hired to be summer counselors at Crystal Lake, where a little boy drowned some time before and a bunch of people were brutally murdered afterward. They show up and do their shtick. The shtick being what teenagers are required to do in cheap horror flicks. Then, slowly, one by one, would-be thrills ensue and fake blood splatters over the walls as we come to realize they are not alone in the middle of nowhere.What I think disturbed me the most about ""Friday the 13th"" was its incredibly dehumanizing, amoral outlook toward young people. When I mentioned these teenagers do their shtick, I was meaning they smoke cigarettes and who-knows-what-else, swear without purpose, and have sex in the cabins where little children are supposed to sleep. Keep in mind, these are supposed to be camp counselors, who are chosen for being respectable, good-mannered, and intelligent. There is a little extra hatred poured on toward the female half of the human race, with the the first victim of the new lot being an ambitious young lady wanting to fulfill her dreams. And then there's the ending, which I shall not give away out of decency for those who, heaven forbid, want to see this movie. But the outlook toward the male half of the human race is particularly immoral and unpleasant as well.And then comes the movie's empty-headed method of putting the audience in the place of the killer, with the camera oftentimes taking the murderer's point-of-view. That means clumsy hand-held cinema techniques, cheesy close-ups of screaming kids, and blood splattering in the background. Now when Steven Spielberg made ""Jaws"" or when John Carpenter made ""Halloween,"" a similar technique was used but it generated horror and apathy toward the killer. Here, it almost seems to imply respect, as if these kids deserve what they have coming. I don't buy it.Its morality-depraved nature aside, ""Friday the 13th"" is just an ambitious mess whose blatantly obvious knock-offs of its betters only makes it suffer worse. The craft is imperfect, with too many hand-held shots being blended with static locked-down ones. Intended to generate suspense as to when the killer is about to pop out, it instead left me tired. And keep in mind, I'm not particularly familiar with the killer-chasing-teens genre. The musical score by Harry Manfredini, particularly the murderer's theme, is a cheap knock-off of Bernard Herrmann's score for ""Psycho"" and sometimes we even hear a thump-thump-thump on the soundtrack that left me looking around for a great white shark instead of a creep holding a hatchet. A lot of shots also resemble shots in ""Halloween,"" furthering my reminder of just how much better that movie was. It almost seems as if the director had never seen any other movies besides the three that I've mentioned several times and was completely unaware of a new way to tell a story. He even uses a cheap rip-off from ""Psycho"" for his twist of an ending, where the killer is revealed. Again, just reminding the audience of how infinitely better that movie was than this one.I'll now answer the question I'm sure that's being asked. Did it scare me? No. As a measure of my boredom, I will refer to a scene in the third act. One teenager is still alive and, of course, is being stalked. Instead of biting my nails or sweating or watching out for the killer, I found myself thinking about my computer science class, a subject which bores the living daylights out of me, and how I could solve my next assignment. Because that was more interesting than what I saw on the screen.The performances by the cast, save for one actress, who also detests the movie and received a lot of infamy for this picture, are good enough, but they belong in better movies. ""Halloween"" was a picture that dealt with similar material but did it in a way that was artistic, respectful toward humanity, and did not try to make us identify with a sicko and condemn the victims. ""Friday the 13th"" is suffer-able; it can be endured. I sat through it without too much difficulty. But it is a very empty, thrill-deprived horror film and the fact that it spawned an entire franchise only makes me like it less. You know, the great critic Leonard Maltin once said that this could be one of the reasons why SATs are plummeting. He may have had a point.",Friday the 13th
133,baumer,a fun series to watch,9,21 June 1999,"Friday the 13ths on a whole can be summed up in one review, that's 1-9. Because essentially what is appealing about one is exactly what is appealing about them all.  So let's start with an overall view of the films.Fridays the 13ths are the kind of movies where you go into the basement to watch when you are 12 or 13 and you're with four or five of your close friends from school on a Friday night and watch these films.  You have your three bags of chips and lots of pop and you wait for that "" chi chi chi ha ha ha "" music to start so you can get all freaked out.  And that's what's so fun about these films.  Even though they are rated R, the ones that enjoy them the best are adolescent males that cheer Jason on and playfully hope that the next death is going to be more inventive than the next.  And you hope to God that noise you heard upstairs at 3:00 in the AM is just the cat. And as strange as a statement as this is going to be, it must be said that there is just something innocent and pure about being scared to death while watching the Friday's.  You know they're not real but they certainly make you want to put the light on in the basement before you go down there alone at night.Friday's are so laughable because they really are poorly made.  The continuity in the films is so terrible that me and some of my friends can actually have fun now just by picking apart the movies.The time-line is so ridiculous that Jason must be in his early 80's now. But that is not the point.  The point is to have fun and enjoy this.  They don't make scary movies like these anymore.  Now, all horror movies are action movies disguised as scary movies.  Studio guys don't realize that what makes a movie scary is an innocent place like Camp Crystal Lake, a killer as maniacal as Jason and teens as horny as the ones that inhabit horror movies from the early 80's.  You don't have that anymore.  It's just not the same.  But back to the actual review of the Friday's.The first one is actually pretty good.  It has an amazing climax to it and for it's time, the decapitation scene was as scary as it gets.  It's like Cunningham took the best parts of the first two Halloweens and not only immitated them, but he went a step further with the gore.  Also look for a young Kevin Bacon in one of the roles ( he dies really well ).The second Friday starts out so incredibly scary that it sets the tone for the whole movie.  And the story that Paul tells around the camp fire is truly terrifying.  The second Friday is probably the 3rd best in the bunch. There are some great deaths and the direction is actually quite good because there are a few scenes that keep you guessing.  I liked this film a lot.The third instalment has to be a terrible film in the 3-D department, but it is really one of the scariest films that I have seen.  Jason is bigger and meaner and he seems to have a chip on his shoulder.  He kills so violently and ruthlessly that he scares you with his brutality alone.  An excellent entry in the series, and the second best one at that.The "" Final Chapter "" is the best installment.  First of all Rick Baker was asked to do the special make-up for the film and his Jason death scene is unbelievably realistic that it still gives me chills.  There are also so many tense moments in the film and so many really innovative and teeth grinding deaths.  I really loved the fourth one ( also look for Corey Feldman, Lawrence Monoson and Crispin Glover ).The fifth one is a joke. It is a great example of terrible writing, awful direction and some pretty bad acting.  But you know what?  It's fun.  It's hard to explain why, but it just makes me laugh every time I watch it ( watch for Boner from Growing Pains in a quick but painful role ).The sixth is the last honest effort in the series and I'd have to say that there are some good chills in here.The seventh and eighth are terrible.  That's all I'll say about that. Just really terrible films. ( But look for Scott Reeves of Y&R fame in the eighth one. )The ninth made me mad.  It starts out so well.  The whole opening sequence had the feel of the first four.  There was lots of atmosphere, great music, false scares, unnecessary nudity ( a Friday trademark ) and a great chase scene.  But after that it just goes back to what made the last two a terrible disappointment.So if you really want to have a good time, watch the first four, they are great, but stay away from the last three.  Have fun and keep the lights on!",Friday the 13th

She killed all the counselors in the camp crystal lake because they didn't look after his son when he was drowning in the lake, instead they had sex and she probably killed those young couples making love back in 50s too. The killing of very young Kevin Bacon and his girlfriend was very good. He was stabbed from his throat from under the bed just after nick the annoying guy's blood dripped from the upper bed. His girlfriend was killed with an axe in the face in bathroom. I thought the girl that couldn't make it to the campsite would be the final girl but she hitchhiked the car of Jason's mother and she was killed in the woods and she brought her dead body in the car to the campsite. The scene where the final girl Alice got on the boat in the lake after beheading Jason's mother was iconic. Jason attacked from under the boat but Alice was rescued by the police officers.",Friday the 13th
137,mentalcritic,The Microsoft of horror films...,2,5 September 2004,"If you want to be surprised by any aspect of this plot, read no further. Although it is pretty difficult to ruin any surprises an FT13 film has to offer, I don't want anyone coming crying to me about not warning them.Those who fail to understand my summary, take heart. It really is a simple thing. After all, Microsoft has been selling what is essentially the same software in different trimmings for the past twenty years, so allowing Hollywood to do the same doesn't seem all that unusual. In fact, the plots of every Friday The 13th film can pretty much be assembled from a construction kit.Looking back on it nowadays, it is hard to imagine what makes this cheap knock-off so memorable. The only noteworthy thing about this incarnation of FT13 is that Kevin Bacon makes an appearance among the cast. It's very much a blink-and-you'll-miss-it performance, but Kevin at least gets to build up the library of people he can be connected to in six steps or less here. Take all the other cast members of the film and ask yourself if you remember them being in any other production. You'll soon see what I mean.Even this ""original"" is unable to sustain eighty minutes of film without recycling from another source. Halloween has been mentioned a number of times. There's also far more creative cheap B-grade slasher flicks such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It also wouldn't surprise me to learn that the concept of a mother coming back to kill the people she blames for her son's death was borrowed from elsewhere, either.The lack of originality in this original would be easy to forgive if it was vaguely interesting. It isn't. As a matter of fact, it is as boring as hell, and not even the incredibly wimpy kill scenes can save it. Much is made about how these scenes had to be censored to appease the MPAA, but really, there is nothing here that directors like Paul Verhoeven or John Woo haven't trounced in terms of intensity a million times over. Whereas films like Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre built up a fear factor in atmosphere, all FT13 has going for it is hype. When you strip that away, it has nothing.In all, I gave FT13 a two out of ten. The extra point is for a very funny performance from a young Kevin Bacon. The rest is pure dreck.",Friday the 13th
138,mattymatt4ever,THIS is a cult classic???,3,5 November 2002,"Big disappointment!  ""Halloween"" a horror classic--that I can understand. But this?  The worst kind of trashy films are the ones that are dull.  Trash films can be amusing, but not this one.  The acting is horrible (except for Betsy Palmer, who I'm surprised is the only one in the cast to be nominated for a Razzie--for God's sake, she added a touch of class to this crowd of amateurs!!!), the directing is horrible, the cinematography is horrible, the special f/x are nothing special.  The only death scene that sticks in my mind is Kevin Bacon's demise.  BTW, I'm glad his acting talent improved immensely by the time he did ""Footloose.""  In the scene, a spear pops out his neck from under the bed--not into his neck, but out of his neck.  Now that's original!  There's only brief nudity, so that really sucks.  The revelation of the murderer kept me amused, but other than that I was dying for this clunker to end.  I was hoping ALL of these stupid victims would die at once!  One criticism I must point out is the lack of character development.  I know nothing about these characters, so why should I care if they die?  Call me a sadist, but off with their heads.  Makes no difference to me.  So I didn't even flinch the moments they got slaughtered.  Not a good sign.  You're supposed to at least care for the victims somewhat.

141,ODDBear,A classic,7,11 May 2004,"While this is in no way the first movie that could be coined a slasher film, this film is the first to set the standard for what became a film phenomenon; teenagers getting slaughtered by the dozen. 
There's no story here, it's just one long buildup to a massacre.  This film just jumps from one kill to the next.  Some compare this movie to Halloween (the first one) and I don't find that justifiable.  Halloween is a much superior film to this one, the craftsmanship alone should tell you that. However, I've always liked Friday the 13th and I'll defend it's right for existence anytime, anywhere.  It doesn't bother with a story, it only has cardboard characters (so we won't mind when they're getting butchered), it doesn't take itself too seriously, it's shot on a low budget and therefore looks cheap,  but in the end it gives us what we desire; A whole lot of inventive killings (from the ingenious mind of Tom Savini). 
In the documentary on the DVD, director Sean S. Cunningham tells of the making of this film and he mentions Betsy Palmer, and she admits to this as well, that when she read the script she thought it was total garbage.  But she wanted a new car and she needed the work. What Cunningham did with this film was create a formula that's going to last longer than the memory of Jason Vorhees (or mrs. Vorhees) and give a bloodthirsty audience just what they wanted.  Put all that together, and throw in a terrific one-note musical score and you've got yourself a classic.",Friday the 13th
142,fmarkland32,Blood donors...,5,13 June 2006,"Camp Crystal Lake has been shut down for years, seems that nothing but bad luck has followed since the death of a boy named Jason. Seems Jason drowned because the counselors were busy making love and not watching him. Now years later the camp is about to be reopened but someone is slaughtering the new counselors, but who? Could it be Jason survived? Friday The 13th became a classic only because the audience that made it so popular back in the 80's (People like me) grew up and became movie critics and looked back at this with fondness. I myself find the first Friday The 13th to be a rather by the numbers slasher flick although I did think it had it's moments. The gore level was very high back in the day but now the carnage is often cut away from in the moment of truth. I did however love the scene where an ax gets slammed into a face, or an arrow going into the neck of an unhappy camper. Oh who am I getting, I love this movie. However due to it's quality I can't rate it higher. However this series had it's ups and downs and for those curious as to what started the slasher movie craze, well look no further. Also I think that most critics failed to notice an admittedly suspenseful final reel. Indeed if the movie had been as tense as the last 10 minutes, this could be an easy 4 star movie. However looking back at this movie in hindsight, there is an element I miss in today's horror movies. In that they were so gritty and the low budget actually gave it a documentary feel which added to the tension.* * out of 4-(Fair)",Friday the 13th
143,one9eighty,"Ki Ki Ki, Ma Ma Ma... or, other words - Kill her, mommy!",8,26 January 2021,"Back in 1980 horror films were trying to push the boundary of what was acceptable, there had been many a video nasty already released, and some big hitters in the horror genre were birthed. ""Friday the 13th"" was made for around $550,000 and would go on to earn almost $60 million globally, not to mention spawn sequels, prequels, games, comics, and various entries into contemporary cinema. This is one of my favourite horror/slasher films of all time, and anyone that is serious about horror must watch this, if they have not already watched it hundred of times already.In 1957 a young boy drowns in the lake at Camp Crystal. A year later two camp councillors are brutally murdered while having sex in a storage cabin. Fast forward to the future and twenty-two-year-old camp councillor Annie Phillips is on her was to the reopened Camp Crystal to work the summer. She never quite makes it because after being dropped off close enough to walk, she is chased through the woods and gets her throat cut. And thus, the fun starts. At the camp, a group of councillors (Ned, Jack, Bill, Marcie, Brenda, and Alice) and the site owner (Steve) are preparing for the season. A storm comes in but by this time the fun has already started. Some of the camp councillors are killed in creative and brutal ways. Alice and Bill investigate as best as they can, while trying to survive while all around them hell is breaking loose. Alice meets a new arrival at the camp, Mrs Voorhees, a middle-aged woman who claims that the boy who drown in 1957 was her son Jason. She blames his death on the councillors who were supposed to be looking after him but were having sex instead. Mrs Voorhees is not revealing everything she knows though, and soon enough Alice has a fight on her hands again.This is a low-budget film that became bigger than most people would have anticipated. It came about primarily due to the success of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" (1978), and like that, managed to cement itself into horror film folklore. It was produced and directed by Sean S. Cunningham, who as well as taking inspiration from Carpenter, had also worked with Wes Craven on exploitation horror film ""The Last House on the Left"" (1972). With this film Cunningham wanted more of a rollercoaster horror that would scare the audience. Something like ""Black Christmas"" (1974) but for a warmer season.When it came to casting, there was more emphasis on hiring people who seemed right for the role of camp councillor rather than seasoned actors. Most of the cast came from soap operas with a handful being auditioned from adverts. Using adverts worked well as a way of marketing the film to kids too. The role of Mrs Voorhees was given to Betsy Palmer after Estelle Parsons snubbed the film on account of it being too violent. Palmer though was not a fan; she thought the film was ""a piece of 5h1t"" and only accepted because she needed to buy a new car. A lot of people tend to forget, this film has Kevin Bacon in it - yes, ""Footloose"" (1984) Kevin Bacon.Filming took place in Hardwick, Blairstown, and Hope in Warren County, New Jersey). The camp which was used is still standing and still operates as a summer camp, it is a boy scout camp called Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco. The lovely make-up effects that you can see on screen are courtesy of make-up genius Tom Savini. He got the call after having success with George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978). As well as the genius make-up, there a special twist in the musical department which was headed up by Harry Manfredi. He wanted to keep things to a minimum and only used music when the killer was about. The idea was not ""manipulate the audience"" unnecessarily but give them enough of a clue when the killer is present. He had to create a musical score which represent the killer in their absence and for that he took some inspiration from the score created by John Williams for the 1975 smash-hit ""Jaws"". The famously chilling sound of ""ki ki ki, ma ma ma"" actually comes from the reciting ""kill her, mommy!"" ...... and just like that I have given a clue to the killer - damnit!Using Mrs Voorhees as the killer was a stroke of genius. Nobody was expecting it and a lot of people who claimed to love horror but had not seen this would often get it wrong, assuming that Jason Voorhees is the killer when in fact it was his mother. If you have seen Wes Craven's ""Scream"" (1996), it famously uses this knowledge in its dialogue when the killer is doing a pop-quiz to potential victims. Cunningham revelled in inventing a serial killer and enjoyed settling on a matriarchal murderer. ""I took motherhood and turned it on its head, and I think that was great fun. Mrs Voorhees was the mother I had always wanted - a mother who would have killed for her kids"".On its release, despite facing very stiff competition from the likes of ""The Shining"" (1980), ""the Fog"" (1980), and ""Prom Night"" (1980), this was a massive success. It might not have been a film that would garner many prestigious awards, but it set itself up as a success in the world of horror. Most of the critics in contemporary cinema actually hated the film because the plot wasn't that deep, and it was pretty straight forward - serial killer stalks sex mad kids. Some saw it as self-indulgent nihilism, inherently voyeuristic, slow paced, and over ambitious with trying to make the gender of the villain a twist. At the time though, some of those same critics did not have foresight enough to see that this film, like some of its contemporaries (including ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) and ""Halloween"" (1978) were part of a developing sub-genre of horror, the slasher film. There are now at least 10 sequels, a cross-over with Freddy Krueger from ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984), reboots, novels, comics, and a video game.I love ""Friday 13th"". It is iconic and genre defining. It is super low budget in comparison to other horror films, but it stands tall and proud as a success. It managed to create a tone and style for horror films which is still emulated 40 years later. With a dark and atmospheric set up there is something raw and voyeuristic about this film. Right from the off we are following the killer, we do not see the killers face till it is too late, all we get is the thrill and black humour of watching kids being brutally killed in creative ways. That is something that follows the franchise through its lifecycle and something that makes the horror almost amusing to fans of the horror genre. This film does not claim to be something it is not; it does not claim to be an intellectual film, it's refreshing in its approach as a straight-up thrill packed scare movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie in every decade that I have watched it. It might not have aged spectacularly due to the way the world has changed, but for atmosphere and thrills it is hard to beat. Do yourself a favour, get some popcorn, turn the lights off, and sit back. 8/10",Friday the 13th
144,Mister-6,Your unlucky day....,2,2 December 1999,"Ah, ""Halloween"" - a movie chock full of suspense, drama, honest-to-goodness shocks and more intensity than any of its ripoffs.Which brings us to ""Friday the 13th"".  Even though they say they were making a movie that had its own agenda and originality, let's help them face the truth: it's a cash-in that was later turned into a cash cow for Paramount Pictures that lasted considerably longer than anyone ever imagined (and far longer than many movie-lovers wanted).Do you even want to know about the plot?  It's the same as any other movie with ""Friday"" and ""13th"" in the title.  A group of kids go to camp, maniac slices, cuts and juliennes them until one fights back and blah, blah, blah....And that's about it.  No imagination, no intelligence, no style.  Just chop, chop, chop.  Though this one is better than any of its far-lesser sequels, it's still nothing when compared to the real classics of this type of film.You want a GOOD mad killer movie?  There's the aforementioned ""Halloween"" (the original ONLY, please) as well as ""Psycho"" (again, the original), both of which have twelve truckloads more panache than ""Friday"" can muster.Just one more reason to consider that day unlucky.Two stars.  Kevin Bacon gets killed off early on - thus saving himself for more worthy projects (way to go, Kev), and Palmer demonstrates the only real acting in this one.

145,TOMASBBloodhound,Why can't I stop watching these films?,8,15 May 2005,"This is the original Friday the 13th installment. But as horror films go, there really was nothing original about it. By 1980, we had already seen Halloween and Black Christmas and countless other slasher films. I just cannot explain either the public's or my own utter fascination with the majority of the films in this series. Any time one comes on , I just have to watch at least part of it. Even if it's one of the bad ones.The first film in the series used a formula that would be repeated in most of the others. We have a group of young camp counselors getting hacked to bits in a remote camp by a mostly unseen killer. Some of the killings are incredibly brutal and some happen off screen. We learn in an unexpected twist at the end that it is a woman doing the killing. She is a former kitchen worker who is getting revenge for the death of her son (Jason Voorhees) many years earlier. He apparently drowned while the counselors on duty were making love. Perhaps that is why nearly anyone in these films who has sex gets offed. Anyway, the mother is finally defeated in a particularly gruesome scene. The following installments feature her son Jason killing off anyone who dares come into the area to have fun.Sounds simple enough, but why all the demand for more sequels? Few really famous people have ever starred in these films. Kevin Bacon (who was hardly famous at the time) and Corey Feldman are perhaps two exceptions. Other than the Tommy Jarvis character beginning in part 4, there was next to no character development in the series. The mostly unknown actors are quickly introduced and obliterated by whatever garden or implement tool is handy. The music is always fun and creepy, but Halloween already set the bar as far as that was concerned. Some may argue that the detailed brutality of the special effects were a big selling point, but these films really only had one or two memorable deaths per episode. The ax to the face featured in part one still stands as one of the best. The POV camera shots utilized in the series had also been done before. (Halloween, once again) I think there are two main factors that have made this series so on-going. First of all, you would have to cite the tiny budgets needed to make the earlier installments. Part one had well-below a one million dollar budget, and all it took was noticeable demand for sequels and you were bound to get one after the other. Another factor was the hockey mask Jason dons in part three. That mask looks very spooky, and it made him an easily recognizable icon in American cinema. Even casual film fans know Jason is the guy with the hockey mask.I love the Friday the 13th series. The older episodes in particular.

146,Hollywood_Yoda,The Original 13th,7,27 October 2006,"In the first installment of this scary saga, we learn the story behind Camp Crystal Lake. It seems that many years ago, the summer of 1957 to be exact, a child supposedly drown in the lake. His name, Jason Voorhees. His mother Pamela, though, has other plans for the campers and counselors.The story begins in the summer of 1979, and the camp is reopening, hoping to put the past behind them now. What they do not know is that Pamela Voorhees blames everyone for the ""death"" of her son, and plans to take revenge against them, all of them.The film stars newcomer Kevin Bacon in his first thriller with death, well before ""Stir of Echoes"". By the end of the film though, Kevin Bacon is dead, as well as other camp counselors. And for Pamela Voorhees, she is no more. Jason sees her murdered (and to know how, watch the movie) and takes revenge upon himself. This leas up to ""Part 2"", which is set about four or five years later.",Friday the 13th
147,jluis1984,The original and the best...,8,27 November 2006,"More than 25 years since its release, more than 10 sequels and an infinite number of imitations, most people seem to remember ""Friday the 13th"" as just another slasher with good-looking teens being killed by a seemingly unstoppable psycho while roaming in an isolated location. However, what most people seem to forget, is that ""Friday the 13th"" looks so typical nowadays precisely because it was the first film of its class, the origin of all those clichés and the film that redefined the mainstream horror genre during the 80s and the 90s. At its time, it was a film as daring enough to be called controversial yet at the same time accessible enough to be appreciated by the mainstream audiences; for those reasons and more, this films can be proud of being the first one, the definitive one, the film that gave birth to the slasher sub genre. Our story begins 22 years after a series of unsolved murders happened at Camp Crystal Lake and forced the closure of the beloved Summer Camp and started the legend of the death curse of Camp Crystal Lake, now known as ""Camp Blood"". Now, the new owner, Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer), decides to reopen the infamous ""Camp Blood"" with the help of six new counselors. Ignoring the warnings of the locals, Steve and his young assistants begin the restoration of the long abandoned Camp, but on the night of Friday the 13th, the group of teens will discover that there may be some true behind the local legends, as the death curse of ""Camp Blood"" returns and a mysterious killer starts to claim fresh, young victims.Writer Victor Miller claims to have taken a crash course in horror writing when he wrote ""Friday the 13th"", as both he and director Sean Cunningham were in desperate need of a success and saw that the horror genre had potential, but knew very little about it. So, by taking John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" as a model, Miller crafted his story about the nightmarish night where a group of teens end up isolated and at the mercy of an unknown serial killer, with the sole purpose of making a successful horror film. And he succeeded, as he took the many different elements that would create the ""slasher rules"" and turned the simple and derivative plot into a roller-coaster of horror, with the perfect mix of fun, horror and mystery that just keeps getting better and better until it reaches the climatic finale.Just like Miller took ideas from other horror stories, Cunningham too employs elements from ""Psycho"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and specially ""Reazione a Catena"", mixing them and taking them one step further, in a simple but very effective approach that slowly develops Miller's plot while at the same time offers a quite graphic vision of violence (thanks to Tom Savini's excellent effects) that completes what we know as the ""slasher set of rules"". Cunningham may not be an original filmmaker, but his ""Friday the 13th"" remains as one of the most effective suspense tales that despite the bad reputation earned by its sequels, still packs up some good chills thanks to its remarkably well done set pieces and the good use of visuals and music to create tension.The acting of the film is one the level of the horror films of its time; sure, those may not be the best performances in horror but are miles ahead most of what was delivered by the film's sequels. While the cast is nothing really special, two exceptions are easily noticeable: the young Adrienne King, who becomes our main character, delivers a very good performance that makes her decision of stop acting even more surprising. And of course, Betsy Palmer, who gives the performance of her lifetime as Mrs. Vorhees, a former cook at Camp Crystal Lake that knows more about the Camp's curse than what she may tell. Palmer truly created an iconic character that sadly has been overshadowed by the image of the killer with the Hockey Mask.While it's true that Cunningham and Miller made a film heavily based on previous horror classics, ""Friday the 13th"" doesn't feel as derivative as it should, as the many ""borrowed"" elements here work together with frightening perfection. And despite having average acting, and a fairly low-budget, what truly has become the movie's fatal flaw is the poor reputation that its sequels, its parodies and its imitators have given to ""Friday the 13th""'s name, making the film the source of laughs instead of scares, and making the series to be synonymous with stupid horror tales. The many sequels have truly harmed this film's reputation among the classics, but the truth is that while this movie is far from being a perfect movie, it's creepy and entertaining enough to deliver fun even more than 25 years after its initial release. To enjoy ""Friday the 13th"", one must try to forget what it's known about the series, and simply enjoy the film as if it was the first time one heard about the infamous crimes of ""Camp Blood"". 8/10",Friday the 13th
148,ivo-cobra8,Welcome to Camp Blood the classic original slasher that started it all my personal favorite,10,24 September 2017,"Friday the 13th is my all time favorite horror slasher film it is in my top 5 favorite Friday the 13th films. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my second favorite ""Friday the 13th"" movie and my all time favorite film in the horror genre. I love this movie to death and it is instant classic for me. I have the t-shirt about this movie the original film and I always wear it so much I love this film and this franchise. I watched this movie 7 years ago when I was a fan of Superntural and I have heard that actor Jared Padalecki was staring in the reboot Friday the 13th (2009) so I decide to checked 4 Friday the 13th movies: Friday the 13th the original, Friday the 13th Part 2, Jason X and of course the 2009 reboot because of Jared Padelcki and I have fun watching them. What can I say? I love this film to death I love it. I got all 11 films on Blu-ray (Freddy Vs. Jason I already had before) this Thursday and I have re watch them all. I watched this film in Friday yes Friday 22th it is a great horror suspense film. I am more a fan of the sequels just this film isn't my number one favorite film but it is in my top fives Friday the 13th films and it is in my second rank in the franchise. About the film this is a classic but the death scenes are too slow very slow it is very slow paced. We never see the assailant or who does those murders but when it comes one hour around the movie it self's becomes interesting, intense, fast paced and goes bloody around. Watch the last 30 min's with Betsy Palmer and Adrienne King there showdown, Betsy steals the show in my opinion. The last 30.mins of the movie is worth of watch.In 1958 A tragic accident at Camp Crystal Lake a young boy drowns in the lake, while the camp counselors are too busy making out, then a little later on two teenagers are brutally murdered and the Camp is closed down. Then fast forward to 1980 and a bunch of teenagers are hired to open up the camp, despite the warnings and then one by one they are killed off.We have a beautiful cast in the film that I like such a: Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Robbi Morgan, Kevin Bacon, Walt Gorney, Peter Brouwer, Laurie Bartram, Jeannine Taylor and of course Ari Lehman as young Jason. All those actors were beautiful and excellent to watch.I love the gory, death scenes which were nice kills, the special effects were real practical and real done. I love practical effects and not the CGI's that are done today. Why are not horror movies like are this one today? Hollywood doesn't make movies like are this one today. The kills in my opinion were gory real practical. There was a snake that was killed in this movie and no she was not a puppet she was a real snake in this movie that was killed off, so the death scene was for real. The effects are really good and shows even this early, Tom Savini knows his stuff, like the throat slit, axe in the head and the epic head chopped off.Directed and produced by Sean S. Cunningham who 5 years later directed and produced my favorite horror film The New Kids I liked that film and watched since I was a teen.Adrienne King was fantastic and excellent as the final girl and heroine who survived and defeated Mrs. Voorhees on the end.Tom Savini (From Dusk Till Dawn, Dawn of the Dead (1978) does special makeup effects for the film that I enjoy.Friday the 13th the original film is my favorite horror film it is a great movie to watch it does kind a get slow the first hour but when Betsy Plamer appears it get's faster around.The DVD and Blu-ray has uncut version of the film which I am glad with it, I love this film to death, I enjoy it I love everything they done with the film. It is my number 4 favorite ""Friday the 13th"" slasher horror movie. In my opinion it is Sean S. Cunningham best film he every did. I want see any new films like are this one today.In 26. May 2017 Friday the 13th: The Game (2017) was released which I might going to buy it next year for my PC if we get the game in our stores. I also bought Friday the 13th t-shirt with Jason's hockey mask on it.R.I.P. Betsy Palmer, Walt Gorney, Laurie Bartram, Rex Everhart and Sally Anne Golden you are missed and I have respect to all of you. The first and the original movie get's my Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval 10/10 by me this is the one that started all the slasher boom, it was ""Friday The 13th"" that started the 80's boom of Slashers, and became a franchise.",Friday the 13th
149,fernandoschiavi,"Even with a irregular narrative, sometimes monotonous; however, there is no denying its leading role in the field of the slasher genre",7,6 September 2021,"The film begins in the summer of 1958, at a camp called Crystal Lake, where young people sing and play the guitar, while a couple of monitors take a ""escape"" upstairs. While the couple is involved in their ""making out"", a first-person camera climbs the stairs, creating an atmosphere of suspense that culminates in the death of the two young lovers. This opening sequence sets the tone for what would be the rest of the film, never showing the killer's face or his motivations for the serial murders.After the opening credits, we have a jump in time to a Friday, June 13th of the ""present"" - probably 1980, as that was the film's production year, although it could very well have been 1975 (two years in which 13 June fell on a Friday). In a quiet country town, a young woman searches the Crystal Lake camp, where she will be tutoring during her vacation. People in town aren't comfortable talking about the place, but she ends up getting a ride to a nearby road. Meanwhile, new trainers are starting to arrive at camp for the training week leading up to the start of the summer season. The youngsters then have fun on their first day, told that the real training would start the next day.Meanwhile, the girl who was looking for the camp at the beginning of the film gets a new ride, but this time we don't see the driver's face. She realizes there's something wrong when the truck she's in exceeds the speed limit, and jumps out of the moving vehicle. The girl is then chased through the forest, horrified, in a sequence again in first person, in which we don't see the murderer's face again. The killing begins at nightfall, beginning the pattern of the series: night falls, it rains, the energy falls, couples have sex and die. There's not much to talk about the deaths themselves, except perhaps that one of the murdered kids was Kevin Bacon before he became famous.The plot is very close to the motto of E Não Lefte None, a novel by Agatha Christie. A group of characters find themselves trapped in an isolated location and are killed one by one. The similarities end in this argument, as Victor Miller's script follows a bloodier and more explicit direction. With a lot of creativity, the bodies are strewn across the backdrops for ornamentation of the classic final chase, with corpses hanging from trees, thrown out of a window or affixed with arrows behind doors in strategies that are now cliché thanks to repetition to exhaustion throughout the 1980s, 1990 and even contemporaneity would come (just remember the endings of Urban Legend and I Know You Did Last Summer, among others). Friday the 13th presented the definitive rules for slasher, a subgenre of horror cinema that shows random characters being chased by assassins, masked or not. As if that wasn't enough, the film scripted by Victor Miller and directed by Sean S. Cunningham ended up creating a branch in its own subgenre: the camp slasher, where scantily clad boys and girls line up at any summer camp while they wait to be sliced up. By the killer of the time.The great merit of Sean S. Cunningham was to bet on identifying the young characters, who would also be a mirror of the audience to be reached. The holiday camp killing setting was the perfect excuse to take them away from the adult realm and leave them alone, both to fall prey to someone mysterious and to be free to have sex and smoke at will. By the way, the sexualization of the characters was such a striking element that it evolved the subtlety of ""Halloween"" into something more open, to the point of creating the stigma of a certain morality implicit in the slasher: sex and drugs would be punishable by death.The murders were also given a ""creative treatment"" - something that would become the conscious focus and hallmark of the franchise - by talented effects and makeup technician Tom Savini, George Romero's usual collaborator on ""Night of the Living Dead"". Furthermore, by taking the position of the killer's eyes, Cunningham's camera not only hides the villain's body and identity, but places the viewer in a voyeuristic position during the hunt. This feature was not the original creation of the work, as it already existed in the Italian giallo and was present in the Canadian classic ""Night of Terror"" of 1974. However, the director took advantage of another effect of this technique on the viewer: in the public's view of 1980, only one man would be able to commit the atrocities of the film. Right?Thus, the expectation of finally knowing the villain's identity is overcome in a great revealing turn that is the origin of the legend of Jason Voorhees and contributed to his success in theaters. Jason as he is known, with his iconic characterizations and supernatural behavior, only begins to take shape after the sequel. In this first work, the star is different. Jason who would be the main killer of the entire franchise is very little present, we know his story at the bottom of the main plot as a disabled little boy, who drowned in the lake at the camp due to a certain negligence of the advisors at the time, he only serves as a reason for the real assassin doing what she does.Harry Manfredini's music is very psychotic. But the déjà vu feel quickly wears off, and the score becomes one of the film's strong points. The great work of makeup master Tom Savini, in line with quick and creative cuts, lends credibility to the various death scenes scattered throughout the film. Friday the 13th has already passed the 40-year mark, but its practical effects remain convincing to this day. As a film, Friday the 13th is not a masterpiece, it is an amateur work, and experimental. But those adjectives don't match the impact it had on cinema in the 1980s, when the studio bosses saw how much money this movie made, it became a given that there would be sequels, and it did.The survivor's final confrontation with the assassin is another defining moment in the film. Almost as much as the boat scene, where we have one of the most famous jump scares of the 80s. Even though a few slow moments (among them an endless coffee-making scene) compromise the experience a little, Friday the 13th is a classic that horror movie fans can't miss.However, it is necessary to emphasize that the script is not formidable, but the ending showing the real killer was a great contrast to what was being produced in the genre. The characters in the film represent the typical archetypes of the 1980s, with two very emblematic cases: Alice is the final girl charged with purity and Ned is the ""clown"" who loves a silly joke and becomes, mercilessly, one of the victims of the bath. Of blood proposed by the narrative. The couple who are sexually related and die soon after are also present, one of the landmarks of the films in this segment. By the way, Alice initially looks a lot like Laurie Strode from Halloween, but takes on her own contours throughout the film. There is also the comic relief, represented on Friday the 13th by police officer Dorf, a fool who appears to make us laugh and demonstrate the fragile situation of young people; after all, the representative of the law is the only and last sample of safety, before the coming night of blood and horror.It's strange in this first film that we know absolutely nothing about the identity of the killer, which causes a certain lack of empathy in the viewer. There is no way to care about any character. And, after one by one they die, leaving only the last victim, we find out who is the murderer. The problem is, we have no idea who the hell the killer is. She doesn't appear during the film, and her tragic story is only told in the final minutes. If we had some hints during the course of the plot that a boy had died from the negligence of the prefect's years before, and that strange things were happening after that, perhaps we would be more concerned about the fate of these people.Even with a irregular narrative, sometimes monotonous; however, there is no denying its leading role in the field of the slasher genre: the film inspired several ""cheapest"" imitations, yielded continuations to the present day and launched one of the most iconic villains in the history of cinema. Even if a person has never even watched any of the episodes of the series, it is practically impossible not to recognize the ""evil"" through a man who wields a machete, adorned with a hockey mask.",Friday the 13th

And what would happen if you put it in a setting infamous for breeding terrifying myths of escaped lunatics and backwoods beasties, like say, a summer camp? Hey, how about one of those classic legendary tales from around the fire told after midnight...but this time for real?Welcome, campers, to Camp Crystal Lake. Any day at this secluded slaughterhouse would be unlucky for you, but here's a bonus! It's ""FRIDAY THE 13TH""...HALLOWEEN knocked it out of the park, when John Carpenter and friends proved that you could wring maximum chills out of a minimum budget. Of course, when that movie became the most successful independent horror film for the time, EVERYBODY wanted to make one. It just so happens that F13 was the next out of the gate, neck-and-neck with a certain, razor-fingered dream demon...The plot, now considered a super-cliché, was oh-so-simple: Years ago at Camp Crystal Lake, the counselors looking after the kids decided to slip off for a little neckin' and nookie, but in their haste to answer the call of overheated hormones, they made the fatal mistake of leaving one of the kids alone. A kid with - shall we say - ""special needs"" named Jason Voorhees, who promptly drowned in the lake. The event was unlucky for Jason, but even worse for the careless kids, who were found brutally murdered the following year. Once that happened, the camp was shut down and never re-opened...Until now.The hype for this movie was unbelievable when it came out. Word of mouth pumped it up so much that it supposedly made LHOTL or even the scariest movie you've ever seen seem like an episode of ROMPER ROOM. (For the record: my scariest movie as a teen up to that point had been SUSPIRIA.)So it was nearly two years before I finally mustered up the courage to see this, on a double bill with F13 PT. 2. What amazed me was two things: how great the makeup effects were (Tom Savini working his magic), and how the more I watched, the less scared I was. Hey! How much is somebody gonna make you wet yourself after DARIO ARGENTO???Well, now this movie has passed into history as kind of a museum piece. It's been folded, spindled, mutilated, parodied, copied and re-copied every conceivable way you can think of, and even paid homage to in countless other movies, (most notably in SCREAM, which is not too surprising.) There's even a remake that will be released in 2009, just in time for...do I REALLY have to tell you?Still, it's a valuable record of horror's gory, glorious ""old school"" days, back when nobody knew who budding screen hunk and victim-to-be Kevin Bacon was, and once Piper Laurie's career had gotten an electric reboot from CARRIE, every languishing star from Hollyweird's Golden Era was stepping up to the plate to try and crack one off. Most famously in F13's case, a big-and-small screen celeb and game show darling named Betsy Palmer, cast WAAAAY against type as the MVP of F13 fame, Mrs. Pamela Voorhees. And what a hellacious job she did, too!Is it really scary these days?

The main film starts with counselors gathering a preparing the campsite and all is going fine until a storm comes and a vicious killer starts to brutally kill the counselors one by one.That is pretty much all that happens and the movie is ridiculously simplistic in its storyline, but the death scenes are among the slasher genre's finest. Tom Savini, the man responsible for the landmark gore effects in ""Dawn of the Dead,"" treats horror buffs with what he does best and it provides for genuinely gruesome fun. Next, and perfectly matched by the gore and great deaths is the suspense, which essentially raises this film past much of the campiness resulting in a solid and mature horror film that is only limited by its budget, but the production made good use of what it had to work with. The film is also clever in the revealing of the killer which essentially puts the classic film ""Psycho"" on its head.

Hollywood made 11 sequels and a remake , if I'm not mistaken. It is also one of the most successful low-budget films ever made. The character of Jason Voorheas is definitely a pop culture icon.""Friday"" obviously takes a LOT ideas from other , much better movies like ""Psycho"" , ""Carrie"" and especially ""Halloween"" . The movie makers admit it was John Carpenter's movie that they were trying to cash in and the similarities in story are quite obvious (holiday , prophet of doom trying to war teenagers , stalker and faceless murder , teens having sex). By today standards this movie is generic as hell , but back then in the 1980 this movie along with ""Halloween"" became genre defining and highly influential . After it's success they were made TONS of similar movies like ""Sleepaway camp"" that were hardly anything , but copies of this one. It's one of the films that to this day still has repercussions.With all this being said , ""Friday The 13th"" is not a great movie , or exactly a good one. It's not even a great movie in it's own genre (""Halloween"" and ""Nightmare on Elm street"" are FAR better). It's just decent enough to provide some cheap thrills even for a non horror fan like me. It has something in it that makes it fun enough and better than the rest run of the mill slashers.The story is thin and nothing special , however the approach to it is pretty great . The movie feels like a ""who dunnit"" type of mystery . We don't know who and why is making the killings and the twist is pretty shocking and clever joke on audience expectations.The movie has teenagers as the main heroes and it is aimed for teenage audience . The killer is symbolically a disapproving conservative parent figure that tries to punish them for unmoral behavior. There are no stereotypical teenagers here , just normal , everyday kids. It's too bad that the screenplay doesn't give them any interesting personalities , they all pretty bland . I guess they work as a sort of ""everyman"" type of characters .Director Sean S. Cunningham uses the point-of-view shot from the killer's eyes as he stalks victims and kills them . He wants us to identify with the killer . He makes the audience themselves feel as if they too were being stalked. Maybe he uses that trick too much during the whole movie , but it's an original idea that he fairly pioneered and was copied ever since . It simply works and the settings of the movie also very effective. The stalkings and slaying in broad daylight and open spaces are a twist in a new direction.Harry Manfredini who is responsible for the music tries to imitate the style of Bernard Hermann (""Psycho""). The score frequently starts chanting ""Kill, kill, kill."" The music is creepy and quite memorable.The movie is nasty and quite sadistic . If you like violence you will be probably satisfied . The movie could had been a bit more bloody and gorier but that is not what the movie is trying to achieve. The special effects do still hold up well.The acting is rather amateurish here , but not necessary terrible . Awful performance by Betsy Palmer , truly worthy a Razzie Award , she almost single handly destroys the movie at the end. Watch out for Kevin Bacon (""Footloose"") playing one of the victims.""Friday the 13th"" might be a cliché slasher , but is an fairly effective one and too important in movie history to miss . Classic horror from the 80's , even if obviously there are many far better horror movies from that decade to watch . Ignore the sequels .I give it 6/10.",Friday the 13th

155,Ben_Cheshire,Through the eyes of the killer.,7,3 May 2004,"(mild spoilers, i suppose - like any movie, you're really better off checking it out yourself first before reading what we have to say about it)Seminal kill-the-teens one-by-one has made the phrases ""Camp Crystal Lake"" ""Voorhees"" ""Ch-ch-ch ha-ha-ha"" iconic, and has defined the genre in many ways: the woodland setting, the summercamp have become favourite settings and the rule of sexuality predicting death.Watching this for the first time as a young adult, i'm happy to inform you that its actually quite scary. Movies like this only lose that initial effect if you've seen them before or have heard much about them.There is some corny dialogue in the first fifteen minutes, but after that its all good. Its very well structured, which comes from a very good screenplay - there is definitely more to it than killing the teens one by one, as in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, for instance (which happens to be a hell of a lot more freaky, but not as complex in the writing). It develops much better than more straight-forward horrors. Its more of a serious horror movie than Nightmare on Elm Street, which is more cheesy fun. Unlike Elm Street it cleverly steers clear of what can spoil the mood: the actors having to act like they're dealing with the deaths actually happening, treating death as if its real. This is done by no-one still alive finding out about those who are dead, and all of it taking place on one rainy night where everyone sleeps in separate cabins to make this work.The murders are quite inventive and unforgettable: two or three in particular took me by total surprise and shocked me by how realistic they looked. The killer themselves puts in a marvellous performance, which such a marvellous face!The reason i think this works so well, aside from the script and the ch-ch-ch-ha-ha-ha is that Cunningham establishes in the early scenes that the killer's scenes will be told in the first person - ie, we see what they see, so we don't know who they are. This gives the entire movie an eerie quality, because every time the camera is placed somewhere, looking at the teens, we have to ask ourselves: is this the killer looking at them right now, or just a regular scene? Are we where the killer is? We feel like the killer could be anywhere, watching everything! Very clever.4 stars.",Friday the 13th

All of which are much better than this effort.I do have a certain affecton for this film, though. Tom Savini's brilliant make-up effects hold up very well, and the movie at least tries to generate suspense. It isn't a patch on Halloween, but it does have its moments.Betsy Palmer is by far the best performer in this film (which includes a young Kevin Bacon), delivering a memorable late turn as Mrs. Vorhees. But until we get to understand the reason for all the killings at Camp Crystal Lake, we have watched a movie with virtually no plot. Horror is more than just a series of deaths lined up in a row, which to be honest is all this film is.Perhaps if the film makers had left it there I might regard it better; but they flooded cinemas with inummerable sequels and helped to utterly ruin the horror genre for 20 years. These movies are all dreck,horror franchises were in, teens made them profitible and subletly evaporated from the horror movie.It is, of course, quite conservative in its outlook. If your a goof-off teen you die, if you sleep with your boyfriend you die, if you play strip Monopoly and smoke weed you die (well all but the heroine!)So, although this film is influential it was not in a good way. As if the producers care.",Friday the 13th
158,acidburn-10,the slasher that started it all,10,27 May 2005,"The plot = In 1958 A tragic accident at Camp Crystal Lake a young boy drowns in the lake, while the camp councellors are too busy making out, then a little later on two teenagers are brutally murdered and the Camp is closed down. Then fast forward to 1980 and a bunch of teenagers are hired to open up the camp, despite the warnings and then one by one they are killed off.Well this is the one that started off the slasher boom,although technically started in 1978 with ""Halloween"", but others that followed that basically failed, it was ""Friday The 13th"" that started the 80;s boom of Slashers, and became a franchise. But in my opinion this and part 2 are the best ones. But this one like ""Halloween"" takes a place of previous safety and effectively turns it into a slaugther house. But it isn't perfect It lacks the tension building skill that made it's slasher predecessors, Halloween and Black Christmas, the chilling classics that they're known as today. But there's no denying that Friday, much like all its sequels, is the exemplification of entertaining, fun 80s cinema. While admitted by the filmmakers to have started out as merely a Halloween knock off, Friday the 13th had enough charm and personality to make a mark of its own on the horror genre. The imitator soon became the imitated.With its abandoned summer camp location, we really get a sense of isolation and vulnerability that was missing from the house lined streets of Haddonfield, Illinois. The film also played around with a ""who done it?"" mystery. Of course when the killer is revealed, it's a total cop out because it comes completely out of nowhere. Since they don't harp on searching for the identity of the killer, it's almost forgivable. While the characters themselves are nothing noteworthy, their demises are what put this one on the map. The effects are really good and shows even this early on that Tom Savini knows his stuff, like the throat slit, axe in the head and the epic head chopped off.The acting, well for me Betsy Palmer (Mrs Voorhees) completely steals the show, even though she only shows up in the last 15-20 minutes, she commands your attention during her too short screen time and you can see that she is having a fun time tearing up the screen. And of course we have superstar in the making Kevin Bacon giving a likable performance as one of the fodder and follows other stars like (Tom Hanks ""He Knows You're Alone"", Jamie Lee Curtis ""Halloween"", Holly Hunter ""The Burning"", Johnny Depp ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" and so on..) making they're names in slasher movies and going on to greater things. Adrienne King does a fine job as the first final girl Alice with what she was given and really gave her all during the finale.All in all Friday The 13th is the one that started it all and a welcome addition and a must see for all fans of slasher.",Friday the 13th
159,Darkside-Reviewer,Welcome to Camp Blood!,7,24 June 2020,"Friday the 13th was released in 1980 and was produced and directed by (Sean S. Cunningham) who had previously worked with another infamous horror movie producer and director (Wes Craven) on the horror/exploitation movie The last house on the left (1972).Friday the 13th was a massive success making over thirty million dollars against a $580.000 budget and was number one at the box office for several months during it's long run in theatre's. Due to the success of this small, low budget slasher movie the 1980s became over saturated with horror/slasher movies that wanted to capitalise on the horror movie craze some went on to become classics like the Nightmare on elm street franchise but for every good movie that was made there was about fifty bad ones until every movie in the genre became tired and predictable until the genres revival with (Wes Cravens) Scream in 1996.Friday the 13th is by no means a great movie it's script is crap and it's about as low budget a movie as you can get but it is good at being an entertaining slasher movie that takes the simple idea of a killer running around a summer camp trying to get revenge for her son drowning in the camps lake and makes it a fun and bloody mess that sees a bunch of teenagers being killed off one by one in bloody and interesting ways until their's only one survivor left usually a young woman who defeats the killer until the sequel.Friday the 13th has a great cast of actor's and actresses including a young Kevin Bacon, Adrienne King and Betsy Palmer. The practical effects were done by the legendary special effects artist Tom Savini who helped make a number of slasher movies including Friday the 13th part 4 and the Burning.Upon it's release Friday the 13th was panned by critics and was labelled as nothing more than a low budget exploitation movie that would soon be forgotten but because of it's success we got ten sequels one cross over with Freddy Vs Jason and one remake so whether or not you think this movie is good or bad it's still a fun movie and remains a classic in the genre for a reason.",Friday the 13th

161,virek213,"Just For The Hack (And Stalk, AND Slash) Of It",6,16 July 2014,"John Carpenter's classic 1978 horror/suspense film HALLOWEEN, which involved teenagers at the mercy of an escaped maniac in a small Illinois town, was such a huge critical and box office success that it eventually had an unfortunate side effect on the entire horror genre that has gone on virtually unchecked for the last three and a half decades. It spawned an endless series of films in which young, nubile teenagers are placed in isolated settings, often engaging one another in illicit sexual situations, only to be hacked up in endlessly graphic and gory ways by a madman. Granted, we had those in some form or another well before HALLOWEEN, and indeed, one could say this began with Hitchcock's PSYCHO in 1960, going through to the 1971 Mario Bava film TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE (probably this film's true progenitor) and culminating in the ultra-controversial 1974 opus THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE. But those films had a great deal of energy behind them, and a lot of thought; and even in a film like CHAINSAW, less blood was actually spilled than what everyone said. After HALLOWEEN, most films of this time were concerned with dismemberment, stalking, slashing, axing, and the like, all with both eyes on the mighty box office dollar.Into this breach stepped director Sean S. Cunningham (who helped produce Wes Craven's 1972 cult film THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT) with the original Friday THE 13TH, released in 1980.The basic plot point is that Camp Crystal Lake in New Jersey has been re-opened after two decades, where a boy named Jason Voorhees drowned in the lake as a result of negligence by the camp counselors. A new set of teens have arrived to revive a traditional summer ritual there, which inevitably involves a lot of sexual fooling around. Over the ensuing fifty to sixty minutes following this set-up, those same kids get chopped up, eviscerated, and dismembered in dozens of admittedly inventive, but invariably gory and violent ways—ways that would be repeated in the dozen or so films in the series that followed, and the dozens upon dozens of other films (A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET; SCREAM; SAW; HOSTEL) that have come since this film came out. In the end, there is only one of them still alive, played by Adrienne King, the only one of the teens not to engage in the kind of sexual activity that led to her friends' untimely demises. But when she meets up with a seemingly kindly woman (Betsy Palmer), she actually meets up with the real killer, since Palmer is the vengeance-seeking mother of the kid that drowned there.This last part is perhaps the most inventive of the film, since, unlike the subsequent sequels that involve Jason and his hockey-mask disguise, it his deranged mother (a la Mrs. Bates in PSYCHO) that does the killing, though, wisely, Palmer doesn't show her stark-raving-bonkers side until it's absolutely necessary. And some of the daytime scenes of Crystal Lake have the feel of the 1972 John Boorman classic DELIVERANCE, itself something of a horror film. But the basic point of Friday THE 13TH's existence is the extremely graphic violence that ensues; and whatever atmosphere and suspense the film otherwise has is abandoned a little more than halfway through for the blood and gore and guts.Friday THE 13TH does boast an early appearance by Kevin Bacon as one of the teens involved; indeed, he was the only one of them who went on to bigger and much better things. And no review of this film would be complete without mentioning the graphic make-up effects of Tom Savini, who worked on DAWN OF THE DEAD in 1978. But in the end, all of this does not, to my mind, make Friday THE 13TH a classic of the horror genre in the manner of PSYCHO, or HALLOWEEN. It is good enough for a rating of six out of ten, but I have to say that's as far as I'm willing to go. In general, the slasher/mad-dog killer genre that this helped accelerate, with a scant few exceptions, has done a lot of damage to the credibility of the horror genre.",Friday the 13th

Before criticizing the film ""for this or that"", it is worth remembering that it is from the 1980s; ""megas"" special effects were not yet the custom, nor were the most sophisticated scripting and client-taking techniques. The film really lacks some aspects of rhythm, acting, script; but who cares? Given the magnitude of witnessing ""the birth"" of serial legend Jason, the piece really lives up to the premise - perhaps one of the most consistent films in the saga.

Now in 1979, it seems the camp is about to reopen thanks to a new owner named Steve (Peter Brower) with other counselors working on rebuilding the place. However a homicidal maniac is stalking them and killing each one of them one by bloody one until one survives to reveal the true killer.Co-starring Betsy Palmer, Kevin Bacon, Adrienne King, Robbin Morgan, Harry Crosby and Mark Nelson, this shocking slasher epic was created by Victor Miller who wrote the screenplay and Sean S. Cunningham who produced, created the concept and directed this movie. The film is influenced by Camp Fire legends including the legend of Cropsy which later was made as ""The Burning"" and also influenced by movies like ""Twitch of the Death Nerve"" (a.k.a. Bay of Blood), ""Halloween"", ""Psycho"" and even ""Black Christmas"". The film was done on a low budget from Georgetown productions which later got distributed by Paramount in the U.S. and Canada while Warner in foreign countries, made in late 1979 to early 1980 then released on June 13th 1980 it became a big hit. In fact it became one of the highest grossing movies of the year despite bad reviews from critics that some have declared it as a ""Halloween"" knock-off but this movie is quite different from ""Halloween"" but more of a mystery type of horror flick with slasher clichés in it. This movie spawned 11 sequels, imitators and a upcoming reboot in the works! although Jason Voorhees wasn't the true killer in this movie but does show up in a couple of sequences he wasn't the true killer of the series until the sequels.Tom Savini's make-up effects including his gore are still quite shocking as they had disgusted and frightened the hell out of people.

If I'm going to claim to be a movie buff, then I really ought to see these films.  So, today I watched the first in the series, ""Friday the 13th"".  I don't know why it has taken me so long to watch these films, I guess it's because I'm not a huge fan of horror movies, and these film just didn't appeal to me.  Well, enough about my life story, let's get to the movie review.I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised with this film.  I expected a really cheesy movie with a horrible plot and a bunch of mindless killing. Ok, well maybe the film IS just that, but it certainly wasn't as cheesy as I thought it would be and the plot was actually quite interesting and actually made sense.  Even now, 22 years after it's release, it's still a scary movie, I found myself jumping a few times throughout the film.The actors were pretty good I suppose, the only one that I recognized and knew by name was Kevin Bacon.  It was really cool to see him at such a young age and in one of his first films.  The rest of the cast was fine, pretty much what you would expect from a movie like this.SPOILER ALERT!!!One thing that really surprised me about this film was that Jason Vorhees wasn't even really in the movie!  He was very important to the story, but he wasn't a main character.  What shocked me even more is that there was no trace of a hockey mask throughout the film.  I thought that was a staple for all the films, like Freddy's glove in The Nightmare on Elm Street films. Anyhow, I was shocked to learn this fact.  Maybe I'll see the hockey mask in the next film?END OF SPOILERSIf you like horror films, then you should definitely see this film!  This is a classic horror film, and so many other films reference ""Friday the 13th"", so you really ought to know what they're talking about when they make a reference to it.

172,elicopperman,A Cult Classic With Hit or Miss Results,6,13 July 2018,"For almost 40 years, Friday the 13th has been praised by many as a horror movie classic, if only for its surprising twist ending and not much else. As such, it spawned over 11 sequels, a couple of reboots, and even a crossover between Freddy Krueger from the Nightmare on Elm Street series, so its status on pop culture is certainly admirable. In terms of what I think of it, while I don't consider it that great of a film, it does its job well enough with what it needed to do, if not perfectly.The basic storyline revolves around six new camp counselors at Camp Crystal Lake, which was previously closed 22 years prior after an unresolved murder case of a little boy occurred. While the new owner Steve Christy tries restoring the camp on the night of Friday the 13th with the aforementioned counselors, a mysterious killer starts to roam around murdering most of them one by one. By that plot alone, there is a direct influence from John Carpenter's ""Halloween"", as writer Victor Miller crafts the film's plot around the night where teens become at mercy towards an unknown serial killer. Even though the plot itself does drag on at points and it's not hard to predict who dies, the general stakes turn the film into a suspenseful thrill ride, and once we reach the famous climax, all these murders add up fantastically.In addition, the usage of slashing is very effective, as the kill count practically completes the suspense with Tom Savini's wonderful makeup effects, with some rather unique ways to murder teens. The set pieces themselves are remarkably well done, especially when it comes to the usage of lighting and shadows that paint the visuals with the right amount of fear more than the story does. While not the most original sounding music, the score also helps build tension whenever a certain character is about to get the axe. It is admirable to see a horror movie shot on a rather low budget, since they never go overboard with effects, scares, or even sets; they just perform with what little resources they have and go nuts with them.However, with everything the film gets right, there are some notable issues it has that bog it down from being special. Most of the acting, while not terrible, leaves much to be desired, as many of the actors either phone it in or are just underwhelming. The only notable exceptions would have to be Adrienne King for delivering the most genuine frightened performance in the whole feature, and Betsy Palmer for combining sweetness and insanity into one. Also, the counselors are pretty annoying when it comes to their shenanigans, and even their deaths take longer to happen than one might think. Lastly, while I get that the ending was clearly sequel bait, it does leave much questioning to those who have just watched this film for the first time, as it comes off as more confusing rather than startling.Needless to say, while by no means a perfect film, I do think the original Friday the 13th succeeds enough in what it was meant to do: thrill teenagers with shocking scares and a horrific payoff. Even if the film isn't without its flaws, it's nonetheless impressive to see a simple slasher flick that was inspired by Halloween become almost as if not more successful by franchise than the aforementioned classic. If you are still yet to see the film, give it a watch and judge whether you think it holds up or not. I know I have many more sequels to get to, so this one was a decent start to a beloved franchise for me.",Friday the 13th

This was the movie that really set all the conventions and the clichés that would come to stereotype the slasher film genre. Friday' has them all, attractive young teens, woodsy setting, teen sex, and of course bloody murders. To say it's a clichéd film by today's standards is perfectly true, but it's also a good clichéd film.

The film builds tension very well, gives some terrific moments of stark suspense and shock. Make up FX master Tom Savini lends his talents in creating some very gory murders. Kudos also go to Harry Manfredini for his spooky score.The cast's performances are mainly mediocre, with the exception of Palmer who does a bravo performance in the films climax.Friday the 13th is a film that will always be praised by slasher fans and for good reason.

177,nickenchuggets,"""You're all doomed""",7,27 August 2021,"A few weeks ago, it happened to be Friday the 13th, and to celebrate the occassion, I finally got around to watching this movie. It is often considered one of the best and most iconic in the horror genre, and has spawned numerous sequels, spinoffs, and video games. After seeing it, I can now conclude it's a little too gory for me, but also manages to be pretty slow moving, plot-wise. I feel one of the reasons why this movie has gotten so much recognition over the years is simply because its plot is very easy to understand, so it can appeal to more people. It begins with a flashback to the 1950s where we see two camp counselors being murdered by some unknown attacker. It then fast forwards to the late 70s, and a fellow counselor named Annie wants to find directions to Camp Crystal Lake. The locals tell her it is allegedly cursed because of all the bad things and murders that happened there many years ago. Additionally, a young kid drowned in the camp's lake in 1957, adding to the macabre reputation. Annie is later killed after being dropped off from an unknown driver's car. Meanwhile at the camp, there are many counselors gathered together, the main one is usually considered to be Alice (Adrienne King). They are discussing how to best renovate the camp for its reopening, when suddenly a bad storm hits and a string of murders happen afterwards, suspiciously similar to the brutal ones that happened in the 50s. Eventually, Alice is the only one still alive and finds herself fighting for her life as her friends are suddenly killed one by one. When it's quiet, she fears the killer the most. Eventually, a car pulls up to the cabin Alice is hiding in and out steps an older woman with a rather harmless appearance. She introduces herself as Mrs. Voorhees, the mother of the boy who drowned in the lake 2 decades earlier. As it turns out, she's the one who has been killing everybody for the death of her son. She eternally hates the camp counselors for being so negligent about the camp's safety precautions, and starts to attack Alice. Following a long and drawn out fight, Alice grabs an axe and decapitates Mrs. Voorhees. Being the only surviving counselor, she takes a nearby canoe and drifts out onto the middle of the lake. The daylight comes, the cops arrive, and it appears that she is now safe. All of a sudden out of nowhere, a horrific looking, decomposed kid lunges out of the water and pulls her under with him. The first time I saw this, I felt my heart jump into my mouth. As the movie nears completion and Mrs. Voorhees is revealed to be the main villain, you finally think that Jason is not in it. Unfortunately, Alice wakes up in the hospital shortly after and is questioned by police, which means Jason didn't actually kill her. This is immensely disappointing to me because the last scene on the lake is deeply disturbing, and it would have made the film much creepier to end it right at that moment. I don't know what they were thinking. Overall, Friday the 13th is one of the most infamous horror movies, but this first one is just mediocre in my opinion. It's slow moving, has a disappointing ending, and doesn't even feature the recognizable hockey mask Jason (who wouldn't appear until like the 3rd movie). It still deserves attention for starting a whole series, but I don't feel Friday the 13th should have ended the way it did.",Friday the 13th

My initial thoughts after this rewatch are lukewarm. It certainly served its purpose and it held my interest, but I'm really not sure after watching it again if it was really worthy of a franchise. This film is complete enough in itself: it's got the slasher elements that we've come to expect from these kinds of movies, and it has a light-heartedly unexplained ending that leaves the audience wanting more. And, really, that's what a good one-off horror film ought to do. The more you show the monster, the more you demystify it. This movie leaves us with enough to the imagination to really appreciate who Jason is, what happened to him, and what his (his mother's?) motives might have been.
I've never seen the vast majority of the sequels. I will be watching some over the next few days as part of the Halloween 2019 rewatch.",Friday the 13th

Of course if you'd seen it in the theatres when it came out, I can see it getting a higher score. Rewatching it now for the first time in probably 30 years, it doesn't hold up well. Some bad acting and effects, but the start of a fun series that I'd still watch more of. It's amazing what can be done on a low budget these days.",Friday the 13th

Now sure, there were plenty of horror movies prior to Friday the 13th, but for some reason it feels as though this was the one that pushed the genre to the more mainstream status. I saw this on HBO when it first came out. That means it was either 1980 or 81, I am not sure of the exact date. That means I was either 7 or 8. I remember it vividly, I was laying on the floor with our giant floor pillow, yes that was a thing back then. I don't think I made in three minutes into the movie before it freaked me out. It was nothing visual that did it, but the ""Ki ki ki, ma ma ma"" that did it. After rejoining the rest of my family on the couch I sat back and enjoyed a great horror flick, though for some reason I believe that HBO toned down the violence back then. I have a clear memory of the screen flashing to bright white light at each kill, and not showing much of the gore. This is the movie that started me on my horror watching life.",Friday the 13th

The sound isn't that great and lacks definition but who cares as this is a great slasher film! It was strong enough to start a legacy but there is little here that the legacy is famous for. Reminiscent of Halloween (1978) but changes the formula to be more fun. It has kitsch value and cheap thrills. The gore is excellent, like really nasty. My favourite are the first four. The start of a franchise but it isn't the best in the series, greatness awaits",Friday the 13th
184,PedroPires90,The Beginning,8,5 May 2021,"The original. The myth. The cultural phenomenon. The beginning.Everybody knows Jason, Everybody knows Crystal Lake and a lot of horror troupes started here, let's not even talk about the numerous copycats with basically the same scenario and group of people.Probably it's not the best of the series (I will be revisiting all of them) and I personally prefer slashers that are not filmed in the killer's view (well, we don't even have the ""real Jason"" here!), but this a really well executed film, considering the basic plot, the budget, the limitations and the basic original material behind. Forget the critics, most of the time they just follow trends.I couldn't finish without mentioning the score. I'm not one of those who thinks that the best horror was on the 70s/80s, there are very good (and in much more quantity) films out there nowadays. However, I believe that the best scores and the best using of audio to create tension was definitely there.",Friday the 13th
185,Rrrobert,"Oh, it's YOU!",7,3 September 2021,"I've seen this twice. Once in the early 1980s once in 2021.It is reasonably entertaining and sometimes scary but even Prom Night and My Bloody Valentine are probably more effective.On first viewing I felt it had similarities to Halloween (1978) with an ending borrowed from Carrie (1976). Now I also see similarities to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) - the chase scenes and the helpful older person that meets the heroine - and Black Christmas (1974).The music seems copied from the Psycho score.The cast are attractive and all pretty likable. All the guys are shown shirtless for extended scenes painting and chopping wood, and in Speedos and Daisy Dukes. The film kind of limps along with a few random scenes of the youngsters goofing off but we never really get a feeling for their character. So half the time you're confused about who is who. Then when they get killed there's no real emotional response because you never got to know the character anyway.Some of the deaths are tense in the moments before. Sometimes we see a graphic bloody death. The effects look pretty decent. In the early 1980s they seemed very bloody but by today's standards it is not that gruesome. But half the murders are off screen - we just see the body later. That seems like a waste of a character / murder. Why kill a character in a horror if we do not see the suspense in the lead up to it, or the kill itself? The goofy prank guy Ned could easily have been cut from the film and his antics and silly lines given to Kevin Bacon's character and no one would have noticed as the kids are all so generic. As it is Ned just disappears early on (killed off screen) and no one seems to notice he is missing.The character of Steve too could have been cut and some of his lines given to Bill no problem. Why did they include the diner bit and all those driving scenes and hitchhiking with Steve? All pointless and led nowhere. Maybe we were meant to think he was the killer? If so that angle didn't really work.Lacking the slickness of Halloween means the suspense here just doesn't build as well. In Halloween, the viewer knows there is a masked homicidal maniac on the loose, sees them, and knows who it is. That makes it scarier.This film added the whodunnit angle which many subsequent slashers continued.The location looks great and is well used.",Friday the 13th
186,emperor_bender,NOT a knock-off of Halloween,7,15 November 2007,"This here is one of the best horror movies, Starring Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, and Laurie Bartram Although the movie itself may not be my favorite, it laid the blueprints for one of my favorite series' of all time. I don't know why people refer to Friday the 13th as being a knock-off of Halloween, but it definitely is not. First off, Mrs. Voorhees is not immortal like Michael Myers. Also, we do not see that she is the killer until the end, whereas Halloween reveals it in the beginning. There is also much more gore in this movie than in Halloween. Also, this movie has much more 'scare value' than Halloween. For one thing, it doesn't take 20 minutes to set up a death scene like it does in Halloween. In Halloween, it'll show the victim for about 20 minutes then finally they'll be stalked for a little then killed. This movie, it'll show the people randomly but you wont really know if they're being stalked until the killer shows up and kills them. Another thing this movie has over Halloween, it takes place in the woods. This automatically makes it much more eerie than a quiet suburb. Anyone who says this movie is a copy of Halloween should be killed by Mrs Voorhees. If they had even taken the time to watch the commentary from director Sean S. Cunningham, he even says he used to make children's videos and all of that then one day decided to make a new type of movie. I don't think he would just copy a movie in its entirety. Sure, maybe he got the basic 'slasher' idea from Halloween, but thats it. If anything, Halloween later copies Friday the 13th in that it becomes a series of sequels. The only Halloween that has any unique character is the 3rd one, because it doesn't copy Friday the 13th by being yet another sequel of the same story. Over all, I like this movie much more than Halloween. Recommend for anyone looking for a late-night scare.",Friday the 13th
187,Gafke,"ki ki ki, ma ma ma",10,13 March 2004,"Once upon a time, Camp Crystal Lake was an idyllic retreat to which the wealthy and beautiful sent their children. But one summer, a young boy drowned all alone in the lake and no one came to help him. The camp counselors who should have been watching him were off making out and engaging in fornication instead of doing their job. Thus, someone killed the camp counselors with a very large knife and Camp Crystal Lake was closed down. It became known as Camp Blood in local legend, a haunted and forsaken place where no one in their right mind would go. But in the late 1970s, a well meaning group of fresh, new camp counselors decided to reopen Camp Crystal Lake and restore it to its former glory. Despite dire warnings from a bicycle riding nutball, the young people set about fixing up the campsite and enjoying the beauty of another summer. However, a mysterious someone is hunting down and killing the young people one by one in horribly brutal ways. Finally, only the innocent Alice is left alive. Will she survive her confrontation with the vengeful Crystal Lake Killer?I absolutely love the Friday the 13th series and I'm not really sure why. They're all pretty dumb and predictable; horny teens/20somethings go to Camp Crystal Lake or close enough as to make no difference, have sex, get murdered and the Last Virginal Good Girl saves the day. Sometimes they replace the girl with a guy, or they move the action from the lake to Somewhere Else, wow! It's like watching someone set up a row of clay pigeons for someone else to blow to smithereens. This movie followed hard upon the heels of Halloween, and ended up being the more popular series due mostly to the character of Jason Voorhees. I'm not sure why Jason is the preferred masked madman; Michael Meyers had the exact same M.O. as Jason, but seems to lack something in comparison. Myself, I think he lacks sympathy. Jason Voorhees, an ugly, deformed little kid, cruelly ridiculed by his fellow camp goers at Crystal Lake, was left to drown a slow, terrifying death in the lake all alone, whilst the camp counselors were off making out. We can feel for Jason; we've all been that ugly little kid left to sink or swim on our own at one time or another. So hell yeah, I'm going to root for the ugly little nerd who returns a huge, muscle-bound bruiser wielding a machete. Go Jason, go!We can further sympathize with Jason in all the sequels that follow due mostly to the fact that it is NOT Jason doing all the brutal murders in this first installment, but rather his mother, a deranged and probably guilt ridden woman (where the hell was SHE when her baby was drowning, huh?) with a warped maternal instinct. One doubts that Jason could have received much love and nurturing from her, yet he remains loyal to her even after death. Jason may be a mute, masked, machine-like hulk, but at some point, he was human and it wasn't his fault that he became what he did...unlike Michael Meyers who was evil from the beginning.Anyway, that's my theory as to why this film was so incredibly popular and continues to spawn sequels to this day. It's all due to Jason Voorhees, because otherwise, all there is to this film is a bunch of dim-bulb kids, running around half dressed (sometimes in the rain), looking for places to screw and alcohol to drink, and presenting such a one-dimensional view of selfish youth that you don't give a damn when the ax rams into their face, or the knife pushes up through their jugular. Who cares? They weren't contributing much anyway, and they aren't anywhere near as interesting, complex or sympathetic as the tortured, eternal child, Jason.",Friday the 13th
188,avik-basu1889,Having sex = Being hacked to death !!!,4,7 November 2017,"To call the characters paper thin will be an understatement. They are just meant to be in the film to get killed off one by one. I could go crazy with my interpretive brain and propose that film is trying to explore the friction between the conflicting ideologies of conservatism and the sexual liberation movement that gained strength during the 1960s and 1970s. But in reality, the film just isn't deep enough to be thought of along those lines. In reality, there is no subtext. The ultimate revelation is abrupt which ruins the credibility of everything that happens before, and the final combat scenes are downright laughable. One can easily feel that both the director Sean S. Cunningham and screenwriter Victor Miller were huge Hitchcock fans. In terms of writing, the ultimate revelation owes a heavy debt to 'Psycho'. The only thing that I genuinely liked about the film was Cunningham's visual style which again owes a heavy debt to Hitchcock. The camera acts as a voyeur. There are some scenes in which it almost feels like we are watching everything from an anonymous individual's POV. I especially liked the way Cunningham used extended long takes in certain scenes to build up tension. He constantly delays the prospect of any character confronting a dead body in the film. But when it does happen, it is done with a really well executed setup and I found that whole sequence impressive. Talking about Hitchcock, the score that accompanies the scenes of terror and murder in 'Friday the 13th' is basically a rip-off of Bernard Herrmann's 'The Murder' score from 'Psycho'.'Friday the 13th' is not deep nor is it trying to be. The characters are a bunch of nobodies. The ultimate revelation and combat scene is laughable. But I'll be lying if I say I didn't somewhat like the direction and the use of camera movements in the film.",Friday the 13th
189,skybrick736,Friday the 13th (6/10),6,28 January 2018,"When it comes to name recognition of a horror film and franchise, Friday the 13th is probably near the top and to many is considered the first film is considered a masterpiece in the slasher genre. The original also really stands out as its own movie compared to all of its predecessor's due tone and the ending reveal. Aside from some great scenes and an excellent suspenseful finish, the writing produced some cheesy lines and unlikeable characters from top to bottom. Adrienne King's scream queen character, Alice, was never captivating on screen with delivery and appearance. Friday the 13th is an above average film that struck gold at the right time with its promiscuous message and kicking off the popular slasher genre.",Friday the 13th
190,bob_meg,Interesting how nostalgia can distort one's point of view....,3,30 December 2009,"I'm not sure how this film qualifies as an ""original"" seeing that's it's premise was openly, admittedly borrowed from other more superior films like ""Halloween"" (style, little splatter) and ""Black Christmas"" (mood, style, some splatter).The only thing Friday I ""pioneered"" was the stringing together of many successive ""uniquely clever"" kills with virtually little or no character development or plot and plenty of ultra-cheap production. Yes, all films want to make money on some level but Friday I and Sean Cunningham in particular never pretended to be about anything else.It's not a complete disaster, and it's not boring. There are good sequences. The suggestions to watch this one with lights off is a good one. Firstly, because the photography is so muddy and the direction so middling, you will need every bit of darkness around you to shed light on the screen. Secondly, it will lend the film a bit more credibility as a thriller (in all fairness, it has a few good jump-in-your-seat moments). Thirdly, when someone comes in the room and starts laughing at you for watching it, you will be harder to see.For those who can't tell the difference between art and commerce...probably few people under the age of 35 at this writing... it's passable and definitely why we've been getting a diet of (for the most part) the same in Horror flicks for years since.",Friday the 13th
191,theshadow908,The one that started it all.,5,11 May 2006,"Friday the 13th tells the story of a group of camp councilors fixing up an abandoned summer camp so it can reopen. The camp has seen rough times in the past. In 1958, a young boy by the name of Jason Voorhees drowned there. In 1959, two camp councilors were murdered there. There were several attempts to open the camp back up, but it was met with arson and poisoned water. Now it looks like the death curse is back, because the group of renovators is being slaughtered one by one.Friday the 13th has become so famous for the following reasons. Its endless sequels, and the fad it started. You can't say that it started the slasher movie craze because it was preceded by Psycho, Black Christmas, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Halloween. However, it did start the craze of cheap 80's slasher movies that no one seemed to mind had bad acting, plots, and special effects. These rip offs included Prom Night, Sleepaway Camp, and Slumber Party Massacre. The acting in Friday the 13th isn't anything spectacular, although it was Kevin Bacon's claim to fame. The special effects aren't that great either. However, Friday the 13th did utilize many of the typical slasher movie formulas such as using point of view shots for the killer, having one woman live to tell the tale, and partying teens.Friday the 13th is entertaining if you're looking for a fun movie to watch in the dark on a Friday night, but it's not a movie that should be taken seriously.5.5/10",Friday the 13th
192,bh_tafe3,Armospheric chiller,7,5 December 2008,"Director Sean S Cunningham took a stab at cashing in on the success of John Carpenter and does a pretty fair job in this atmospheric outing.The story is really a part of movie folklore, and 80s pop culture. A handicapped, freakishly disfigured boy named Jason Vorhees is sent to a summer camp, where he dies in a drowning accident while two camp leaders who are supposed to be watching him are committing carnal acts.This inspires Jason's mother to go on a murderous rampage when the campsite re opens, including memorably giving Kevin Bacon an unexpected tracheotomy. Mrs Vorhees being the killer was considered a big twist at the time, though Scream has well and truly taken away that surprise for modern viewers.This is about what you'd expect from a slasher film, horrible acting, basic script, mixed effects and a simple and effective score.The murder scenes on a whole are well laid out, the ending, aiming to set up the sequels, where it is in fact Jason doing the killing, is still effective now.This is an eighties horror film so watch out for nudity and tame sex scenes.

Several reasons are usually given:1.  The rise of the Religious Right (""Reverend"" Jerry Fallwell and the ""Moral Majority"") 2.  The awareness of the spread of AIDS and its consequences. 3.  Major studios after having been taken over by large conglomerates had the ""revelation"" that cheap films were highly profitable.Why, may be subject to debate, but their success is now the stuff of legend.I do not think the first in this series was the best, I think they got better until they peaked at number five and their success started to attract the attention of the above mentioned ""Moral Majority"".  This had the MPAA running scared and the threat of an ""X"" rating caused the studios to back to the point where the violence and sex were curtailed, but the plots did not get any more original.This one managed to be pretty good however, despite the lack of nudity.",Friday the 13th
194,buckikris,"Camp Blood, Are They Opening That Place Up Again?",10,15 September 2019,"I will never forget the time I saw this movie, I was 8 years old and an active scout who went to camp every summer. This film scared the crap out of me, even though I had seen other films like Halloween, The Omen, Jaws, ETC.; this one had a major effect on me.The movie is about camp counselors who despite the numerous warning about the camp decide to reopen it. All the locals know about it's history; and That's how it received it's nickname Camp Blood. At Crystal Lake everyone is busy and Steve Christy( Peter Bower) needs to go into town to get more supplies.When Steve leaves, I thought he was the the killer at first. When Annie, the camp cook( Robbie Morgan) is trying to get to Crystal Lake. She has to walk the rest of the way. She gets lucky and gets a ride, the vehicle is a jeep. The same color as Steve's. When the jeep passes the camp site, Annie takes a risk and jumps out and into the woods. Soon the killer is right behind her and she ends up getting her throat slashed. So it made me wonder, because he is gone most of the movie.The counselors, Alice( Adrienne King), Bill( Harry Crosby), Jack( Kevin Bacon), Brenda( Laurie Marie Bartram), Ned( Mark Nelson), and Marcie( Jeannie Taylor) are left to get more work done. They blow off work, and enjoy their time while Steve is gone. They are aware of a big storm on the way and time is of the essence.When the rain begins trouble is not far behind. When I watched this the first time the kill scenes were graphic, now I have the uncut version. The difference is the kill scenes are more intense, and I believe some editing mistakes are fixed unlike on the VHS version. One of the most memorial kill scenes is Kevin Bacon's. After he and Marcie have sex, she has to leave to use the bathroom. When he lights a joint he notices blood dripping from the top bunk. All of a sudden a hand holds his forehead down, while an archery bow goes up through his neck. In the uncut version it is more intense, and you see Ned's body in a more close up while thunder and lighting strike. Then there is Marcie's, when she is looking through the showers to see if any of them are hiding; and trying to scare her. You see a shadow of an axe, when she turns the axe comes down through her face.I have to say I'm not a fan of every Friday film of the series, but this has got to be the best one. This is the first time I saw Kevin Bacon in a film and I thought Betsy Palmer's performance as Pamela Voorhees was out standing. Tom Savini make up effect were excellent, because they looked so real, unlike in other horror films. Every slasher film has these rules. Those who have sex, the know it all, and the obnoxious are usually the damned. The one who usually survives all the trauma is the heroic virgin.The movie includes those fears we think about when we are alone in the woods, the watcher across the lake, stalker in the shower/bathroom, and the psycho killer. I have always been a fan of this film, not only does Ron Milkie's character officer Dorf bring some comic relief, but Crazy Ralph sends chills up our spine with his preaching. The showdown between Alice and Mrs. Voorhees is about as graphic as it gets, but having a female heroine is priceless. Adrienne King was excellent at her role. I highly recommend this film to all Friday The 13th Fans and to anyone who loves old school horror. In a way this film has a valuable life lesson; and always be aware of your surroundings.",Friday the 13th
195,DigitalRevenantX7,Mediocre for a classic,4,9 December 2008,"In 1957, Camp Crystal Lake is closed due to the deaths of two of it's counsellors. Years later, it is due to reopen. But while the new counsellors prepare the camp, an unseen intruder stalks the camp, picking the counsellors off one by one.When John Carpenter's classic ""Halloween"" came out, the slasher film was born. But while that film created the whole concept of the slasher, in which fun-loving teenagers are stalked & brutally murdered by a masked intruder, it wasn't until two years later that ""Friday the 13th"" made the concept popular. Indeed it set the standard for a whole heap of imitators & ripoffs, not to mention NINE sequels to date.For all it's success (& a sizable cult following), ""Friday the 13th"" is a surprisingly crude film. The film was greenlighted before a script was even written, in fact a magazine ad featuring the title smashing through glass was instrumental in getting it off the ground. The script, written in a hurry, is minimalist to an extreme degree. When you think about it, everything in the film is either very stupid or very badly written. The only reason Betsy Palmer's villain gives for going on a killing rampage is the death of her son. If that's the case, if she doesn't want any other child to die, why doesn't she work to establish a safety code for the camp, instead of just killing off all the workers? The acting varies, with the performances ranging from lacklustre to downright bad. The direction consists of stalking scenes patterned after the opening scene of ""Halloween"", which becomes hard on the eyes after a few seconds. Then there's the score If composer Harry Manfredini thinks that the 'ki, ki, ki, ma, ma, ma' sound is spooky, then he's an idiot. Instead of sounding spooky, it just sounds cheesy & reeks of overkill. Mind you, the film does attain a degree of intensity during the climactic scene, but overdoes it with the shock ending, which does make you jump but is essentially pointless. But for all it's faults, the film remains miles ahead of most of it's sequels.",Friday the 13th

What set this apart at the time was its realistic and excessively gory special effects (courtesy Tom Savini) which were unlike anything seen in a major studio (Paramount) release. The story is simple: twenty years ago, little Jason Voorhees (supposedly) drowned in the waters of Camp Crystal Lake as a result of negligent camp counselers, who were later murdered. Now, someone is butchering counselers at the very same camp, just before its grand re-opening. Is it the legendary Jason? As we would all soon find out, it's Jason's mother (Betsy Palmer), back to take revenge on a new generation of horny teens for daring to re-open her son's place of death. Apart from the gory effects (axe in the face, arrow through the neck, several slit throats) and one or two decent jolts (particularly the obvious, but effective CARRIE-like finale), this is a rather run-of-the-mill body count movie. There's not even much skin to speak of (other than brief breasts one nude male butt), so it's pretty surprising that this took off the way it did.Still, it's one of the better in the series (not that that's saying much) and you could certainly do worse at the video store on a Saturday night.

An Excellent,Scary,And Suspenseful Horror Classic.",10,7 October 2013,"Friday The 13th is one of greatest Horror films ever made,an excellent,scary and suspenseful Horror classic that is filled with great atmospheric direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy and iconic score and amazing special effects. All of those combinations make Friday The 13th a a landmark Horror film and one of the best Slasher movies ever made.Friday The 13th tells the story of a camp called Camp Crystal Lake that was closed down in the 1950s after a boy drowned and two Camp Counselers were murdered by an unknown killer. Over twenty years later,a group of new Camp counselors have come to Camp Crystal lake to help reopen the place. Unfortunately for the counselors they are being stalked and murdered by an unseen killer on Friday The 13th a day where nothing will save them and a day when the Camp will run red with blood.After the critical and box office success of John Carpenter's Horror classic Halloween in 1978,the film spawned many imitators in it's wake two years after which included films such as Prom Night and Terror Train(both in 1980)and many others. But,one of the best Slasher films to come out after Halloween was Friday The 13th(another film that ironically spawned it's own imitators),a scary and terrifying film that was panned by film critics but a Box Office Hit and was the beginning of one of the best and most successful film and Horror movie franchises in in film history and while Friday The 13th doesn't match Halloween on a film making level,Friday The 13th is a great Horror film that has carved it's own place in Horror history. Right from the start,Friday The 13th is an amazing Horror film and is a roller coaster ride that is filled with scares,shocks and terror and is a movie that holds a tight grip on the viewer until the very end and never let's go. What I love about F13 is that the film takes the concept of Halloween and takes from a small town to a camp in the woods where in the woods you are alone and completely isolated from civilization. Also,where as Halloween was just about terror and atmosphere,F13 is a movie was about scares and gore and the scares in F13 are suspenseful and well-done making the viewer feel a sense of dread and fear and is done with great build-up and when the scares happen your heart is racing and when each scare in the film happens the movie becomes more and more intense as it goes and you will feel like no one is safe from death. The kills and gore in F13 is effective and adds to the film because the gory scenes are truly shocking and unexpected giving viewers an uneasy feeling that is felt throughout because the kills and gore are either seen on screen or off. F13 isn't just about blood and gore because the film also has a great,suspenseful atmosphere that is dark,creepy and at times gritty with falling rain,the sights of trees and cabins look realistic and intense making the Camp locations look very frightening. What also makes the atmosphere in F13 great is the killer and the killer's P.O.V and the fact we don't see the killer's face when he or she is stalking the victims hiding in the forest or in the darkest never knowing when the killer is going to strike. F13 and it's style would be imitated by later Slasher film's in the 1980s. The main characters while in a Slasher film are likable and sympathetic and you feel bad for them when things start to go wrong. Where in most of the sequels we are rooting for the killer,in F13 we root the main characters to survive and get out alive. The ending is of the scariest and most surprising endings in movie history and will make you jump out of your seat while also leaving the ending open for many of the sequels. A classic and unforgettable ending.The cast does wonderful jobs in their roles. Betsy Palmer is fantastic as Mrs. Pamela Voorhees,an old friend of Crystal Lake. Adrienne King is wonderful as Alice,with King bringing depth and sweetness to the role. Kevin Bacon(in one of his early film roles)and Jeannie Taylor do great jobs as Jack and Marcie,a couple who are counselors at the camp. Harry Crosby is sensational as Bill,one of the counselors. Laurie Bartram is outstanding as Brenda,a feisty girl. Mark Nelson is funny as Ned,with Nelson bringing Humor to the film. Debbi Morgan is fine and memorable as Annie,another counselor. Peter Brouwer is good as Steve,the head counselor. Walt Gromney is creepy and over the top as Crazy Ralph,an old man that's trying to warn the young counselors. Ronn Carroll(Sgt.Tierney)gives a good performance as well.The direction by Sean Cunningham is great,with Cunningham a dark,creepy and gritty style to the film. Fine direction,Cunningham.The score by Harry Manfredini is brilliant,intense,scary and one of the best and most iconic scores in Horror film history and it truly adds to the film. Amazing score,Manfredini.The special make-up effects by Tom Savini are terrific,gory and realistic and are among Savini's best work as an effects artist. Great effects,Savini.In final word,if you love Horror film or Slasher movies,I highly suggest you see Friday The 13th,one of the greatest Horror films ever made and an excellent,scary and suspenseful Horror classic that deserves to be in every Horror fans movie collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Friday the 13th
200,PeterRoeder,The classic horror movie,9,16 October 2003,"This is a great movie. When I was a child I watched the rest of the series, and as an older teenager saw the original. The ending is SO, SO, SCARY! I dare you to think of a ending on any movie (maybe ""Planet of the Apes?) which is more shocking and surprising!!    The notion that this movie has some ethics, intelligence and that it takes place in a wood is also fairly interesting.    The dumb teenagers might cast of some adult viewers though.   Anyway, death is always a good theme since it shows solidarity with those of us who are about to die (and who isn´t?)    Jason Voorhees will to power still prevails and hold true in the darkness of mysterious woods and lakes.    After all, who knows what lurks out there in the American wilderness?   This movie is as ethical as ""Animal Liberation"" by Peter Singer, as interesting as ""Psycho"" by Alfred Hitchcok, and as poetic as Walt Whitmans ""Leaves of Grass"".    The special effects man, Tom Savini, is a genious, and he shows us the horror he himself experienced in the Vietnam War. As he points out, even though he has created the whole setup in the end - he - and the crew - THEY get scared as well everytime they watch it. Obviously no shock in an American horror movie (the Japanese movies ""The Ring"" and ""Dark Water"" are far more shocking and scary than any American horror movie thus far, I think) has ever been more effective than the mind-blowing ending to Friday the 13th.",Friday the 13th
201,MovieGuy01,Classic 80's horror....,8,25 October 2009,"I thought that Friday The 13th was a great horror movie. The film starts in 1958, two summer camp counsellors at Camp Crystal Lake sneak away from a camp fire sing-along to have sex. Before they can completely undress, an unseen person sneaks into the room and murders them both. The film moves forward to 1980; a young woman named Annie (Robbi Morgan) enters a small diner and asks for directions to Camp Crystal Lake, to the shock of the restaurant's staff. A strange old man named Ralph (Walt Gorney) reacts to the news of the camp's reopening by warning Annie that they are ""all doomed"". Enos (Rex Everhart), a truck driver from the diner, agrees to give Annie a lift to the camp. During the drive, he warns her about the camp, informing her that a young boy drowned in Crystal Lake in 1957,At the camp, the other counsellors, Ned (Mark Nelson), Jack (Kevin Bacon), Bill (Harry Crosby), Marcie (Jeannine Taylor), Alice (Adrienne King), and Brenda (Laurie Bartram) are refurbishing the cabins and facilities along with the camp's owner, Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer. They receive a visit from Ralph, who again warns them that they are ""doomed"". As a violent storm closes in The unknown killer begins to isolate and murder the counsellors.

202,Brian-272,"Another Classic Horror Genre, But Ranks A Distant Third To A Nightmare On Elm Street And Halloween.",4,13 June 2000,"Hard to believe it's the 20th anniversary of this film, I remember growing up to the popularity of this film and it terrified me and many others in their younger years. After just watching it again about an hour ago I finally realized this film no longer scares or frightens and it never really did. Many people thought this film began the horror-slasher film genre, but that began two years earlier in 1978 with Halloween. Friday The 13TH fails to portray their killer as a sociopath (Freddy Kruger) A Nightmare On Elm Street, or a suspense scare the hell out of you knive wielding killer (Michael Myers) Halloween. And the whole point of horror films are to bring out emotions on an audience instead Friday The 13Th brings the rush approach of just killing and killing victims in the woods with no suspense or scares to stir up emotions. True Friday The 13Th is by far an 80's slasher classic and very watchable to any horror film fan, but if your more hard core and want your scares mixed with suspense and emotions then the Nightmare On Elm Street and Halloween series are much better to keep in memory and keepsake.",Friday the 13th
203,mnpollio,Fairly effective of its type,6,22 November 2010,"This film and the subsequent indestructible series that it spawned will never be confused with Shakespeare. That said, some of the earlier entries are fairly effective in their sense of dread and jolts before the entire series devolved into an assembly line of utter trash that fails to even live up to the minor demands of this sub-genre. Following the surprise mammoth success of the original Halloween, movie makers everywhere began vomiting forth holiday themed slasher pictures. Of the imitators, Friday the 13th is certainly notable and was arguably the most successful alongside A Nightmare on Elm Street, which came a few years later. The simple scenario of a group of camp counselors stalked by an unseen predator while undertaking their efforts to re-open a children's camp, dubbed Camp Blood by the locals due to a series of deaths from years before, is decent enough on which to hang the set pieces of the film. Unlike many of its later sequels and far worse imitators, the film sticks with the small handful of counselors for the duration of the film and does not require a brutal death every five minutes. It would be too much to say that we ""care"" what happens to them, so much as they at least seem credible to a good extent when the carnage starts. Even the initial victim - killed fairly early in the film - gets a lengthy exposition on her background and reasons for working at the camp. The trademark score certainly spooks things up and Sean Cunningham's direction does what it needs to - it keeps the pace moving and elevates the suspense and dread in the final third of the film to keep viewers edgy. Unlike Halloween, this film does not really skimp on the gore, but unlike far worse of its ilk, it does not dwell needlessly on it either. The death scenes are gruesome, but fairly quick. The film also doesn't make the genre mistake of having all or even most of the victims be female - a tiresome conceit from other films. The cast (including then newbie Kevin Bacon) is believable as they work, relax, flirt and die, but there are really no great stand-outs. Adrienne King is an adequate heroine, who manages to be terrified, gutsy and vulnerable, and she interestingly breaks the mold as she is depicted as having a relationship with the head of the camp and is not the standard virginal good girl. Betsy Palmer is an intimidating late addition to the film as the now legendary Pamela Voorhees and the fight scenes between her and King are incredibly suspenseful and well-choreographed. The cheap DePalma-esquire shock epilogue on the film was hackneyed then and seems worse now - and, of course, opens the door for the countless sequels.",Friday the 13th
204,Rendanlovell,Awful beginning to a franchise,2,19 July 2020,"Weirdly enough I played Friday The 13th The Game before watching any of these films. Now finally having seen the one that started it all, I was surprised by it in unexpected ways. Like how Kevin Bacon is just randomly in this, in one of his first roles. Or how it feels like a mixture of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the gorilla camera work), Halloween (the killer), and finally Psycho (also the killer). The most unexpected thing is how terrible this is. This is particularly strange considering how iconic the Jason character has become and how many sequels there are to this bad movie. The story is basically none existent to start off. It's about camp counselors at newly reopened Camp Crystal Lake. The story is literally just them setting up the camp and also dying. The characters don't help this by being complete flat lines. They aren't even serviceable. It's hard to tell some of them apart because none have a personality. Plus, the performances are generally awful or unconvincing. Now, these types of thrown together slashers are generally all about the kills. Who cares about the characters or story when you got awesome kills?? Unfortunately, even the kills suck. It starts right away in the first scene where two counselors are murdered. It's horrifically awkward and you don't see anything. Both kills are off camera with the second one being a stupid freeze frame right before she dies. Most of the deaths are like this to an extent. Either off camera or unconvincing. There's a throat slit early on that looks just terrible. There's also very little driving this film. Plot points aren't well established, built up, or even presented at times. Long stretches of this are literally elongated kill scene after elongated kill scene. Lets talk positives though, some positives of this include the setting. I enjoyed the camp ground in the middle of renovation/controversy, that's an interesting place to set a slasher. Plus I do like the grittiness of this. It's surprisingly grim for this type of movie and offers very little happiness, which I liked. The Gorilla style and barebones production helps create a more grounded tone, but that's about it. It just doesn't work. It's a mess of influences and cheap production. Ima stick with the game over this lol.",Friday the 13th

206,loomis78-815-989034,The best of the entire series. Slasher Gold.,9,23 February 2014,"Opening at summer Camp Crystal Lake 1958, an unseen prowler viciously kills two teenagers who have gone off to make love. Jump to Friday June 13th, 1980 and Annie (Robbi Morgan) is on her way to be the cook at the reopening Crystal Lake summer camp. The town nut job, known as Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney) tells her she won't come back again and Camp Blood, as it is known has a death curse. The same unseen prowler from the beginning picks up Annie who jumps from the jeep only to be hunted down and have her throat slashed. Back at camp, there are 6 other camp counselors who engage in strip monopoly, sun bathing, playing pranks on each other and doing drugs and having sex. The unseen killer makes gruesome hamburger of the teens until Alice (King) is the last alive in a battle of wills. This practically nothing plot takes it's ""Halloween"" slasher inspiration, strips away the style of that film, and ups the gore and shocking deaths, and history was made. All though ""Halloween"" started the modern slasher phase, it was this film that was responsible for unleashing the gory slasher experience upon moviegoers in the early 1980's. Director Sean S. Cunningham keeps things simple and lets the films real star take center stage. That star is special effects man Tom Savini who certainly hits a career high point with his exceptional work here. Like he did on ""Dawn of the Dead"", Savini gives the audience something they haven't seen before. The death of Kevin Bacon's character Jack is a shocking moment along with Marcie's Axe to the face scene. Cunningham uses Savini's shock sequences to show the audience everything. Nothing is left to the imagination. Cunningham does deliver real suspense with brutal end results which puts the viewer in a sort of fun house with jumps and shocks mixed with the heavy gore. The acting is average at best and the film steals POV shots from ""Halloween"" and music from ""Psycho"" and still manages to be entertaining as hell in its own right. Cunningham saves his biggest jump shock for his last scene. An absolute classic Jump that is guaranteed to work the first time you see this movie. The end jolt also sets up the future of the franchise that would have a very long run. Friday the 13th was exactly what audiences were looking for in 1980 and it delivers it and then some. This is still the best film in the series and has the most scares.",Friday the 13th
207,I_Am_The_Taylrus,Average Slasher Film,7,27 October 2006,"SPOILERSI just don't know what the big deal is with this film, it's pretty average. A mother's son drowns because the counselors weren't paying attention. She takes revenge by killing some counselors a year later, then when it's reopened a couple years later, she kills the counselors there. This is before Jason, this is his mother, Pamela Voorhees. This is a very gory film, especially for 1980. I also want to comment on something else, this is a lot like Psycho! In this a mother kills for her son, and talks for her. In Psycho, a son kills for his mother and talks for her. Psycho obviously came first in 1960, while this came out in 1980.There are ten average deaths in this film, well, maybe except for the arrow in the neck, which is pretty original. Here are the deaths.Barry: Stabbed by a hunting knife.Claudette: Stabbed by a hunting knife.Annie: Her throat is cut with a knife.Neddy: His throat is cut with a knife.Jack: An arrow is stabbed into his neck.Marcie: She is sliced in the face with an ax while imitating Katharine Hepburn.Brenda: Killed of screen. Throat slit? Steve: He is stabbed with a hunting knife.Bill: He is impaled with numerous arrows.Pamela Voorhees: She is decapitated by Alice.Alice is the heroine by killing Mrs. Voorhees. She sets off in a canoe. She wakes up and the police are up on the hill. All of a sudden, Jason's decayed body grabs her and pulls her under.She wakes up in a hospital, Jason was just a dream. The film ends with a unusually beautiful shot of the lake at Camp Crystal Lake.Overall, this is very average, and pretty overrated.7/10 Recommended Films: Halloween, Scream, A Nightmare On Elm Street, and Black Christmas.",Friday the 13th
208,the amorphousmachine,"In this case, the original isn't the best!",3,14 December 2004,"(Major Spoilers)I saw 'Friday the 13th' ages ago, and I remember I wasn't that impressed to begin with, but after going through the entire series again, I had to re-rent this one on DVD. Quite frankly, the whole franchise is rather up and down, and it really depends on how serious you take your horror/slasher films. It's quite hard to come to his movie with eyes completely closed if you are aware of Jason and Camp Crystal Lake. I heard of Jason Voorhees as a horror icon way before I saw this film, and also saw some of the sequels before I ever saw the original film. I found that you don't really need to watch the original film to understand the latter sequels.Jason is known as an unstoppable freak with a hockey-mask, yet that hockey-mask aspect doesn't come into play until 'Friday the 13th Part 3'. In the original film, Jason is not the crazed killer in the movie, and it was in fact his mother (Betsy Palmer) that started this famous movie horror franchise, and Jason wasn't an icon yet. So, it's hard to view this movie as completely fresh mystery whodunit horror style flick! Initial audiences might have been surprised at the outcome, because they suspected one of the potential victims as the killer, yet Voorhees's mother was not introduced prior.Viewing this film now, it's extremely hard to take seriously. It uses the same formula that becomes tiresome throughout the first four films. You never see the killer (until the end), and the characters are killed off one by one. Some characters are trying to have sex, or are playing stupid games, and yet all of them seem oblivious to what's going on! And for some reason, there is always a character that is a practical joker amongst them.I don't really rate the characters in the first film, and I found them pretty much stock-standard. Probably the only interesting aspect about these people is that a young Kevin Bacon is playing one of them. That's about it! The death scenes are pretty weak in the first film, and because there is no super-natural element in this movie, the believability factor is really stretched. I don't think the original 'Friday the 13th' was a great film, and I think it was the sequels that established its popularity. This movie was generally pretty crap.It has an awful script, pretty crappy acting (though Betsy Palmer made the most of it), and characters do extremely stupid things. The problems I had with the film are plentiful. The style just isn't scary. The camera taking the point of view of the killer did not creep me out at all, and it just seemed cheesy to me. And there are other things that were annoying, like *MAJOR SPOILER(s) HERE* two characters having sex completely unaware of a dead body in the bunk above- even though they could have seen it beforehand, or even smelt it when they entered the room. And of course, one of the characters goes to the toilet, and then the other character left finally notices something is up and then on cue, the killer strikes from under the bed. I was sitting there rolling my eyes. Then of course, not long after, the killer manages to get to the toilet unseen, and deal with the other one! It's hard to take seriously.The killer seems to get around way to much, and completely remove evidence; like bodies and blood in a seemingly short amount of time- and also seems to be able to plant bodies in certain places to scare the remaining survivors- you know, just for kicks! When the remaining characters clue on something is up, they seem panicked in one scene, yet they still decide to separate rather than remain together, or take a nap, or make a cup of coffee in the following scenes. Hello, your pals have disappeared and two scenes ago, you spotted a bloodied axe??? Would you really stick around and go and make coffee? The only saving grace about 'Friday the 13th' is the ending. I'm sure it would have jolted the initial audience at the time, and it certainly paved way for the horror icon in Jason Voorhees to be developed in future films. However, in the case of the first 'Friday the 13th'- the original film is not better than most of its sequels. Recommended for fans of the series, but I'm sure some horror buffs couldn't take this one seriously or get that much satisfaction from the death sequences or scares. It's simply not a good movie- not even for the horror/slasher genre, and Mrs Voorhees gets a thumbs down!*½ out of *****!",Friday the 13th
209,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,80's slasher film that become a cult classic among fans in the horror section,10,5 September 2019,"Yes the original ""Friday the 13th"" movie is a good, decent 80's horror slasher cult clasisc film. Why this movie get's so much hate? Okay it is not a great film, but it is still good in my opinion. I heard a lot of bad stuff about this movie, but watching this movie again it was not that bad like people are saying. It was not slow paced, boring actually in fact it was fast paced horror mystery slasher. I prefer this movie over Part 2, Final Chapter, Jason X and Jason Goes to Hell that is just my opinion. I love this movie to death, it is a decent slasher and my favorite movie that is better than next sequel.Where was Jason? This movie was never about Jason been the killer, Jason Voorhees was never the star of this film. It was writen and produced by Sean S. Cunningham who never thought this movie would become antgoing franchise. Why dosen't Sleepaway Camp get's hate but this movie that I love has too? Sleepaway Camp sucks I said it! Sue me I hate that film. Halloween (1979) movie get's better rating and it has less kills but that movie is great but this isn't a good slasher film? umm?This movie was never about Jason if you watch Scream (1996) it was explained who the original killer was in this movie, Jason showed up in the sequel.So far the story goes about reopening Camp Crystal Lake with a new owner and a young counselers. When a young boy drowned and a several vicious murders have occured. A brutal killer exacts revenge on the hapless counselors.Why I love this film: the music theme from Harry Manfredini his tune makes abolutelly a classic film. The cast: Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Jeannine Taylor, Laurie Bartram, Kevin Bacon, Mark Nelson, Robbi Morgan they are all adorable likable cast. It is a different movie from the rest of the sequels but that is not bad folks.Adrienne King as Alice the main girl is a unique heroine she fought back on the killer and she didn't give up. Adrienne King's performence is excellent. She is my favorite final girl in this movie I love how they filmed this movie in New Jersey. I love the fact that there was only one survival girl, who fought back against a maniac Killer. Bad-ass Alice Hardy, she kicked ass so much! The FX effects from Tom Savini are great. Young girl's neck is slashed with a knive and you see blood, It is Rated R, a girl gets an axe in the head. A killer's head is cut with a machette. Tom Savini knows his stuff. Crazy Ralph was also great in this movie in which he warned the counselers they were doomed if they stay in Camp Crystal Lake. Betsy Palmer really steals the show I really miss the actress, I am a huge fan of this film.I love A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Evil Dead so why shouldn't I love this movie? The original Friday the 13th film? I love this film to death! Actress Laurie Bartram as Brenda was excellent, I love the storm used in this film. I notice this but Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter copies the scenes from this film.R.I.P. Betsy Palmer, Laurie Bartram, Sally Anne Golden, Willie Adams, Walt Gorney and Rex Everhart you are all missed.I enjoy this movie more than Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter or Jason Goes to Hell that is my opinion. Sean S. Cunningham directed this movie well. Victor Miller wrote a good script. I have the t-shirt about this movie and i will always love this film.Friday the 13th (1980) is an 80's creative, original slasher film that started the slashers in the 80's my second favorite ""Friday the 13th"" film with Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood and a good one.

210,Jacques98,"Not the best slasher, but still good.",3,2 September 2008,"I was never a fan of slasher films, mainly because I always found them cheesy or typical. And though they are, generally, I can't help but thank them for the landmarks they made in horror and in cinema in general. Friday the 13th certainly deserves credit for this.It was the first camp-themed horror movie, which played into the memories that most of us had at camps as kids. I can still remember that feeling of being watched as I was alone in a camp dorm, and laying there thinking something was under my bed, which amazed me when the arrow came through the bed in this movie. Easily the most memorable part.Also, the idea of not having Jason as the original killer was ingenious. Just everything about the movie was ingenious, and it deserves the classic status it has.Age has given it a layer of cheese, but if I had grown up in its time I'm sure it would have been one of my favorite movies, period. It defied generational clichés (who was really killing), created an entire new horror setting (the camp), and solidified the slasher structure and gave it a meaning (sex killed Jason, essentially). This is a landmark in punk entertainment for its time. I appreciate it now, but as I said, the layer of cheese is still there. It's not perfect anymore. Maybe the remake will fix that.This movie is a slasher film. You watch people get killed for the space of the movie. What more is there to say?

To me, it sounds more like a campfire horror story, with creative ways to die (hatchet in the face, spear in the neck, mass spearing...) and various 'final' fights.Jason makes just a cameo in this one, at the end (if only he had dragged her down for real!), as he will come into play from the sequel, which, if you liked this, will be just your cup of tea, like parts 3 and 4 (which shows the killer's headstone, with the WRONG year (1980, not 1979!)).

If you want good and decent slasher flicks, go back to the roots. In the early 80s, slashers were just getting started. When you went to see one of those, what did you expect? Pretty actresses, inventive deaths, and a generally creepy story! And that's all they needed. At the forefront came ""Friday the 13th"", which would one day become the franchise best remembered for the hockey-masked Jason. But in 1980, the filmmakers set out to make a scary movie set at a summer camp. You have mostly stereotyped camp counselors who are soon slain in a variety of ways. Many seem to hearken back to the best urban legends. As night wears on, and the body pile grows, we get what is one of the scariest performances in slasher history. But for those who haven't seen FT13 or SCREAM, I won't reveal the killer's identity! The special effects and make-up, done by the DEAD guru Tom Savini, are what this movie does best. The scares come pretty fast and most deaths only last a few seconds. Compare that with the long, drawn-out death scenes of later installments. Sheesh, sometimes less is more!

It was the beginning of Friday the 13th, a date which many fear due to this franchiseThere were some great aspects about this film and some not so great aspects of the film. I personally found the plot rather well done, with nothing except someone out for revenge, simply killing all that enter Camp Crystal Lake. The plot is very simplistic, yet very enjoyable. The idea of a mom being a serial killer in this film can be laughable and can also be scary. However, the film suffers from other openings to classic slashers. ""Original Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Original Halloween"" and ""Original Child's Play"" were so well done that it was extremely enjoyable, whereas I personally found the film very quiet on many different occasions, with no real surprise to me. Also, unlike the sequels, the killing seems to be far too separated from one another. However, the soundtrack is the spookiest part of this film. Its done so well and the acting is good, with the entire cast chipping in. What I liked most about this film is that a mother isn't just an insane person out there killing for no reason, but its simply to revenge her son, the one she loved more than anything. What I liked about the sequels was that it was Jason, this time, getting revenge on anyone who enters the site by killing all and attempting to keep it closed in memory of his mother.The kills in this film aren't spooky but its done nicely. Overall, not one of the better horror films, but certainly good enough. 6/10",Friday the 13th
217,ryan-10075,"""You're doomed! You're all doomed!""",7,16 April 2020,"Usually when I write a review for a film I try my best to not let it contain major spoilers, but for this classic I feel I must.When I was a kid my best buddy Kevin and I were major horror fans. I was a huge Freddy fan, while Kevin was a huge Jason fan. It was with him I saw for the first time the FRIDAY THE 13TH movies and through him I became a horror film fanatic really. The first time I saw this was with him and another friend of ours John. To be honest I didn't like this movie...at all. In fact I think I hated it. My problem was I was expecting the killer to be Jason, which it is not and thought that the pace was lazy and slow. After rewatching this movie I don't know at least 30 times since then I do proclaim this to be a pretty good horror film even though it is quite flawed for a film that has spawned I can't remember exactly but I think 10 sequels. Some things this film really nails quite well, while others well it does miss the mark a bit on.Well, if you are reading this I hope you have seen the film, but if not it starts in 1958 where two camp councillors are killed when they are in the act of getting ready for some premarital sex. Flash forward twenty years and Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer) is going to reopen the camp that the locals call Camp Blood. For at Camp Crystal Lake back in the 50s a young boy named Jason Vorhees had drowned in the lake when councillors weren't paying any attention. So a new group of councillors including a young Kevin Bacon and Harry Crosby who is the son of the legendary Bing Crosby are brought to the camp early to get it ready for when it opens. The councillors are being wiped off one by one by some unknown killer.By the end of the film we find out that killer is in fact Jason's mother Pamela played by Betsy Palmer, who in my opinion easily steals the film. What is kind of incredible is she has maybe 15 minutes of screen time and she quickly becomes a horror icon for her role. Other performances in this film are okay, like it is cool to see a young Kevin Bacon in a slasher and plays his character well and no one really puts in a bad job, but no one really stands out though either. But, it wasn't written that way either. FRIDAY THE 13TH is not known for great performances or amazing story lines. They are about the kills and the nudity.I must say though that I am quite mixed about the story though. As a who-done-it to me it kind of fails and is not a giallo which just maybe writer Victor Miller was trying to create here. It is really a giallo with no suspects or people who you could think it might be beyond perhaps Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney) or if you have heard of Jason, then him. As a set up to Jason's character or his ambitions to kill in later films it does pretty good. Just don't think too hard about it though, because it just ain't going to add up. I am also mixed on the ending as they created one of the greatest jump scares of all time when Jason grabs Alice (Adrienne King) in the canoe, but then there is more tacked on to explain it was a dream. Man, it would have been so much better to leave the ending with the jump scare and start Part 2 without the beginning with Alice, because I find it so slow and unneeded if you ended with the correct jump scare.The music by Harry Manfredini is a major plus and really a terrific horror score. Like HALLOWEEN ( a film that this one rips off to create a box office smash) without the signature theme I can not imagine them without the A+ music. Besides the original does have more than just the horror theme that was used I think in all the sequels. There are other themes here that surprisingly for a FRIDAY THE 13TH movie shows some care and depth in the music.Finally to me a real big reason why this was so huge was Tom Savini. He did the practical effects for this film who at this time was known for the makeup and effects he did on George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD. To go through his kills: Annie (throat slashed which to this day looks extremely real to me), Jack (arrow through his neck which most fans I think love the most and probably scared the MPAA when first seen), Marcie (axe to the face, which I really enjoy) to Pamela herself (might be one of the most memorable kills in the series with her beheading). They are all top notch and sadly a couple are off-screen. The only one that was lame was Steve Christy's.Produced and directed by Sean S. Cunningham who created perhaps much more than he was expecting a never-ending cash machine of a series and a horror icon in Jason (although he isn't seen much in the original, but you WILL remember him). The director of Parts 2 & 3 Steve Miner acted as associate producer here.When I first saw it I likely would have put it down on the bottom of the list of FRIDAY THE 13TH movies. Now, it really is one of the better ones, while not my favourite I know that Cunningham's style which partly was stolen from HALLOWEEN in the POV shots was copied in most of the following entries in the series and it really does create a nice early 80s atmospheric horror film.",Friday the 13th
218,TheHande,Classic Slasher,7,16 February 2009,"Friday the 13th as a slasher film is quite a humble movie compared to what would eventually be in store as it would evolve into a franchise of an exploitative and later even a self-parodying nature. The first movie establishes the basic rules and storyline and in it does a decent job.The young cast provide an unusually sympathetic group of characters for what has become a real cliché group of characters. The kills aren't that gruesome but violent enough in their own right to give the movie a morbid energy. Atmospherically the film works and the added of element of nostalgia also gives it a bit of a sympathetic quality.I'd have to say all in all that the last act of the film is the strongest. Pamela Voorhees is perhaps not the most iconic of movie-killers but still a competent psychotic villain for this film. The ending is also one of the best and most classic scares in any horror movie and its effect has not changed.Friday the 13th's only problem is its close approximation and indeed rather blatant similarities to other Slashers of the day, mainly John Carpenter's Halloween, compared to which it perhaps lacks the extra finish to make it as memorable a movie, but it's still a fun, scary movie in its own right.",Friday the 13th
219,Toronto85,Friday the 13th,7,10 March 2011,"This is the film that started a fury of sequels and helped create the slasher genre. Friday the 13th is interesting from the rest because there is a bit of a mystery as to who the killer is. Of course, if you've seen any of the other sequels or know the horror genre, the killer's identity is pretty much a known fact. I watched Friday the 13th Part 2 before this one years ago so it gave the mystery away completely. Friday the 13th is about a bunch of young camp counsellors who are opening up Camp Crystal Lake after many serious incidents have taken place there over the years. The place kind of has a bad name so to speak. One by one, we see the counsellors being stalked in the woods by someone or something. Many of them are killed off leading up to a shocking conclusion.This first one was never as good as parts two, three and four for obvious reasons surrounding the killer's identity. I felt parts 2-4 were really the best of the Friday the 13th films. But this is a legendary film on it's own. It created that sub-genre of teens being stalked in the woods. Many other films were made after 1980 with similar plots. The Burning, Don't go in the Woods, The Final Terror come to mind as being rip offs of the early Friday the 13th films.This is definitely a must see for any horror fan. There are some genuine scares like when one girl goes to the out house/washroom and hears noises behind the shower curtains. And the gore is done well by Tom Savini. The acting is also not bad. Check it out.8/10",Friday the 13th

The film follows a group of camp counselors at the now famous Camp Crystal Lake as someone watches them,killing them off one by one. Like Halloween,Friday The 13th is an amazing horror film,some people have said that this film is just another 80's type horror film that didn't need another 9 sequels and spin offs,one remake and one canceled spin off but I think this as well and Halloween and Nightmare On Elm Street were the three best horrors series's ever. Something,now this doesn't really have anything to do with this but I wish Leatherface got a big bunch of movies and was as good as these three because,like,come on! He's a mad man and I wish Ghostface,Pinhead,Chucky and even Reverend Henry Kane would get there own franchise..but,anyway,sorry,going back,Friday The 13th is a brilliant classic,definitely watch it but,I'm pretty sure you all have!!",Friday the 13th

Maybe do you want to swim a little... no, no, no... i mean... do you want to be killed by a maniac?... sorry i say maniac?... well, come and see ""Friday the 13th"", to see Kevin Bacon in one of his first roles and how his character is totally murdered in a horrible way.OK... first of all, not matters how seems, i don't hate so much ""Friday the 13th""... is just that that have some problems. And, i mean... is bad. The first of a lot of sequels told us the story of campers who go to Crystal Lake to have fun at Friday the 13th... but, well, at the next day all of them going to be killed. I mean, is not original, is just a silly plot that sold a lot. You cant compare this horror movie with titles like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""Hellraiser"" (Dont take it count its sequels, maybe its parodies) that are excellent horror films from the 80s. But... ""Friday the 13th"".How i say before, i don't hate completely this movie, because it have some things that i like it and save it of be forgotten. First, there is a scene where they try to kill a snake... that was a good scene (Not for kill the snake, i love animals) because was funny watch all the group scary and in the floor, one above another and breaking all the stuffs of the room. The scene when one of the girls (I don't remember if is Branda or Marcie), going into the woods with her lantern and suddenly appear lights, and suddenly appears screams. The music is a classic for the genre (But not more than the classic theme of ""Halloween"" by John Carpenter). And, the thing that most like it, was the end. No, no the end of surprise in the lake, the end of the end, when Alice say: ""He is still there"" and show with a beautiful (Classic in the 80s) music, show us a picturesque woods reproduced in the lake, and the ending leave us with the credits with so mysterious scene. So mysterious that scares!!! Of rest, well, nothing. Nothing personal, but i think that the film it turns very repetitive and makes me yawn. But still, i really recommend it for any Halloween reunion with your friends. This and all the sequels.PD: I think that Part 2 have an incredible ending too.*Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.",Friday the 13th
222,Mr_Censored,"Camp Blood inspired a flood, but is hardly a dud.",8,12 February 2009,"After the success of a little indie horror-film by the name of ""Halloween,"" struggling film-maker Sean S. Cunningham sought to cash in on the formula and release a holiday themed slasher all his own: ""Friday The 13th."" A whodunit with a fresh young cast (including a then unknown Kevin Bacon) and a score of ground-breaking make-up effects, Cunningham's little creation not only inspired a flood of sequels (10 to date, with an impending remake) but a generation of slasher films that owe their existence to it. And to this day, it still holds up.What makes the film so effective? It could be the setting, a very realistic, sometimes spooky camp that gives way to loads of atmosphere. It helps, of course, that the bulk of the characters in the film look and feel real. Even for all of their little flaws, you can't help but feel for the unfortunate kids, regardless of how many times you've seen the movie. You could perhaps chalk part of it up to the outrageous death scenes, and -- more importantly -- the effects that drive them home. Ground-breaking for their time and besting the lazier CGI work of today, Tom Savini's career-making work is still a vicious and grisly sight to behold to this day. Whatever it is, one thing is certain: ""Friday The 13th"" is a time-tested, eternally entertaining and flat-out fun little horror film.The story is pretty basic. Teenagers prepping for a children's camp take part in a little rest and relaxation -- a.k.a. pre-marital sex, pot-smoking and strip-Monopoly (?) -- only to find out the hard way that a brutal killer is terrorizing their isolated neck of the woods, picking off would-be counselors one by one. Obviously the mystery element of the story has been obliterated by pop-culture's grasp of a certain hockey-masked man-child, but the final reveal is still a shocker, driven home by a bold and fearless performance that gives way to the most effective stalk scene in the film. The ending -- interpreted whichever way you please -- is still a jumper to this day and is just one example of the subtle yet admirable cinematography and the chilling score by Harry Manfredini that accompanies it. From front to end, ""Friday The 13th"" is a true classic. Like ""Halloween"" -- but with less of a film-school vibe -- it's a movie that can be enjoyed again and again and has earned it's status as one of the grand-daddies of the slasher genre. In spite of the up-and-down franchise that followed in it's wake, it's still a gem.",Friday the 13th

After all, it was this movie that started a series of endless sequels.After seeing it, I would have to say that one of the few things I really enjoyed about it was the story and setting which dealt with a group of camp counselors who were opening a camp up for children which had been closed down due to a murder a few years ago. They are soon stalked by a psycho killer out for revenge that we never get a real good look at until later. This killer proceeds to kill them one by one. With this movie the killer is somewhat surprising, remember, this is the first film in the series.I also enjoyed some of the creative death scenes as well as one of the final scenes which is probably one of the best shocking moments in all of horror movie history, but other than that this movie offers little else. The actors were poor, and yes this first Friday the 13th includes a young Kevin Bacon, probably the only actor who went on to success after this film. The other names I don't even remember, except for Betsy Palmer. There is no real suspense or mystery in this film either, just a bunch of shocks and gore. That is not a good way to make a horror movie.Overall this movie, which copied it's idea from Psycho and mainly Halloween, two movies that are far superior to it, is not quite the competent horror film. But alas, the never ending sequels continued anyway with only part 6 matching the first because of it's humor more than anything. I still wait to see the perfect campfire tale. This one just doesn't quite make the grade, but sadly it is probably the best one dealing with psycho killers and camping.",Friday the 13th
229,kingofdanerds,The more and more I watch this film the more and more I don't care for it,5,16 November 2020,"Friday the 13th is a 1980 slasher film that, when it was released, became very popular due to its violence and nudity and what not. Due to the film's success, a whole franchise of movies was born. Friday the 13th was controversial for its depictions of violence and nudity and a lot of scenes were heavily cut by the MPAA but the film has recieved an Uncut release (of which I watched). Which is good for this film but a lot of the other films are mostly unable to recieve the same treat AND I WANT MORE GORE!!! With that being said, the film was trashed by the critics but audiences loved it. The film was directed by Sean Cunningham and stared Adrienne King, Betsy Palmer, and an early performance from Kevin Bacon. Other than that, nobody else really notable. The film had a small budget of $500,000 and due to its small budget was a huge success at the box office.The film starts in 1958 at Camp Crystal Lake where we witness the murder of two camp counselors. Who is the killer? We do not know. Cut to years later and the same camp where the murders happened is going to be reopened but before it can, a group of new counselors are fixing up the place. Camp Crystal Lake is a bad place, the locals say but none of the counselors listen. Perhaps being killed will make them listen...I understand that Friday the 13th is often labeled as iconic but the more and more I watch this film, there just does not seem to be anything really iconic about this film. The film is often labeled by many as a blatant copycat of Halloween. Honestly, I don't think so. I personally do not see any similarities between the two films. Friday the 13th plays out as a mystery in a way. Sure, we do not know who the killer is (and many people who have not seen the movie know who it is). Where this film fails in that department is not giving us any good suspects. Hell, the film doesn't give us any at all. So it comes as no surprise when the killer is revealed that the killer is someone we have no idea who they are. Granted, the killer is one of the better parts of the film. The film is a slow burn with mostly filler. Nothing exciting happens and when something does, it is typically a horny person getting axed off. But when the killer is revealed, the film picks up and is really fun to watch. But in the mean time, we have to sit through over an hour of filler. Nothing exciting happens at all. The characters are not interesting and do not get developed at all. The only character trait we get from them are horny. The final girl of this film is overrated in my opinion and while she does not share the same character traits as the other people, she is still not that interesting. (Pretty much everyone knows who the final girl is but I know there is a small percentage out there who has not seen the film and therefore deserve to see a spoiler free review). With that being said the killer is the best character of the film. The killer when revealed is at first unassuming but starts being very creepy. The performance is really good here. Some other things to praise about this film is the special effects/gore which is done very well by the legendary Tom Savini. The effects while not the goriest of all the Friday the 13th films (wait till Part IV) they are still gory nonetheless and they still hold up in my opinion. The Harry Manfredini score is really good and is instantly recognizable. While the film is not scary at all, there are a few creepy moments which can be attributed to the cinematography. The POV shots are nice and at times they use these shots when not needed which I find to be effective in this film. It makes the viewer think the killer is there because of how it is shot and sometimes the killer is not there. The whole scenery is somewhat generic but the setting is interesting because like in a film like Halloween, the evil came to the people. But in Friday the 13th, they come to the evil. Again, the killer is the best part of the film but the very very end of the film is possibly the scariest part of the film but is ultimately ruined by the actual final scene of the film.Friday the 13th 1980 is a film that I would not even call good or even a meh movie. To me, there is nothing all too special about this film and lacks the entertainment value of the sequels. While there are some good or even great things to say about the film, there are more things that I can find uninteresting about the film. Yes, I make it a tradition to watch this film or even some of the sequels every Friday the 13th, but does not mean it is a good film. It is just a good old date night popcorn movie",Friday the 13th

231,RhapsodyReviews,Good Slasher for the 1980's.,7,4 October 2019,"Review:
'Friday the 13th' is an American slasher film directed by Sean S. Cunningham. Speaking just about this movie and not the franchise, makes this feel like a different type of movie than we view it as today. I wish I could have been around to see this movie when it was first released because I believe that this film is a mystery above all, but now that it's connected to the 'Friday the 13th' franchise we all know today, it's categorised as a horror film.
The film tells the story of a group of teenage camp counselors who are murdered one by one by an unknown killer while attempting to re-open an abandoned summer camp.
Almost everybody in this movie is known only for this movie. Besides Kevin Bacon and Betsy Palmer, nobody had made a name for themselves after or prior to this film. For being a movie from the 80's, I can't complain about the acting, it was on par with what you would expect for a film from that decade for the most part.
I love everything about this movie, the cheesiness of the murders, the comic relief it has throughout and the fact we always see the kills from the first-person perspective. It made an original and possibly very risky decision in doing that and I believe it pulled it off.
Overall, it is a typical slasher movie with some of its own personality intertwined throughout. If you haven't seen it and like slashers give it a try.

It does seem to borrow ideas from Halloween, however it does try to trick and susprise us. Music and effects are both very good and still some what chilling despite the movies age. I'm not sure this movie is quite as good as we think it is even though it gave birth to an iconic killer but it took intill later films to define him.",Friday the 13th
233,FKDZ,Good for a couple laughs.,5,21 August 2020,"So I finally watched this movie. And my general consensus is that after having seen Halloween and various other slashers I feel like even though the things they did with the low budget is admirable, it lacks a bit too much.The directing is sloppy, the POV killer camera is alright though but some scenes the camera just holds for too long, and it becomes awkward like you are waiting for something to happen, but it never does. And it never ends up doing throughout the movie. So it wasn't a setup to catch you off guard in a future scene.The acting is iffy all around the board and just outright funny during some kill scenes. The scream the girl let out just before she got an axe to the head had me in tears. It was incredibly unconvincing.The characters are not too bad, but they are killed of WAY to fast. Ned, arguably the best character just for his lines and stupidity gets killed in the most unsatisfying and subtle ways. And the movie lost its comedic relief like 20 minutes in. Also, all the characters going out alone time and time again became annoying predictable.Now my main annoyance with the story, was Alice just flip a switch of being totally freaked out to ''i'm going to take a nap''. Just before she was running around with Bill paranoid out of their minds because everyone is GONE. But oh well, guess I'll take a nap? Seemed like sloppy writing just to kill off Bill because he doesn't want her to get up from her nap.. Ofcourse, Bill doesn't come back and Alice ends up finding his body and the killer chase scene commends.Now the Killer reveal was incredibly surprising but also a bit funny. All I know about this movie franchise is that there is a masked muscular killer so to see this old lady AS the killer was quite the polar opposite. The fight and chase scenes were sloppy but not too bad actually, although Alice only figures out how to finish the job after like 4 times. The final kill was pretty fun as well. If I had to rate the best kil it would still be the one where the Mrs Voorhees is under the bed and kill the guy with an arrow. One of the only jumpscares that worked for me.The music all things considered is good, really enjoyed it and definitely added a ton of suspense.Now the end, wow that caught me by surprise and I could imagine back in the day people gasping and screaming in the theatre. Because that thing (jason) was the first SCARY thing in the movie. Mrs Voorhees was intimidating, but never scary to me. And damn that boat scene got me.How she got out of the lake is never explained, just saved by the cops but no one saw Jason. So the movie ends with a pretty huge cliffhanger. And I will definitely be watching the next few movies.At the end though, I do rate it a 5/10 because I really wouldn't care to watch it again. There are much better slasher movies made before this with equally low budgets. It was still fun to watch it for the first time though, and I'm looking forward to the sequels.",Friday the 13th

Murderous, vengeful mother distraught over her sons death due to the neglect by horny counselors is out to punish all the other kids. She has something against anyone young and sexually active I guess? Well anyways, the movie does leave you on a bit of a cliffhanger. Due to the lack of evidence, is the only surviving camper going to be blamed for the murders? Does she now have to live with terrorizing dreams? Who knows.

This movie and the series pales in comparision to the Halloweens and Nightmares, simply because all of these movies seem to be the same. 
The story-line does not transition from movie to movie with ease.  True, Parts 1-4 had transitions, but they always used flashback scenes.  Then 5-9 skipped the transitions (flashback scenes) and with minor exceptions are not related story lines (even Jason (or his mother) disappears in the 5th (in reality) and 9th (basically) ones and he is the main guy).Anyway, this is one of the best in the series (top 5 anyway) because it was the first and it does have something to set it apart.Quite simply, it makes the game of Monopoly more than a battle of braking the bank, which usually takes hours.  This movie has a new form of gaming ""strip monopoly"".  While none of the Friday's are terrible (5 and 9 probably being the worst), none of them are tense or suspensful or anything more than the routine slashing and killing.  Part 3-D has juiced up music, but the same story. Part 8 has a new story twist, but no new music,etc...  The better ones in the series add something (like strip monopoly, or 3D, or a claustrophobic environment of a boat), but none of them seem to put it all together in one film.As horror goes, better than average, a good series, but not one of the greats.In general nothing special.",Friday the 13th
237,tapio_hietamaki,A genre-defining slasher,7,16 March 2013,"This, the very first Friday the 13th film, is an entertaining watch but hasn't held up against time very well. Much better slasher films have been made since (personally I prefer the revival slashers, especially Scream), though I guess it's a matter of opinion whether the original Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street are better than this.Friday takes place in a single day and much of the film follows the clueless teenagers spending their time gleefully at a summer camp without supervision. One by one they get offed by an unknown murderer. The mood gets tense but not really frightening. The film suffers from its lack of conflict -- the kids have no idea someone's after them, and they never really have any time to get scared before they're killed. The ending fight is somewhat climactic but the build-up could've been handled better.The cheesy gore effects are... well, we've seen better nowadays, but the old B-movie effects have their charm.",Friday the 13th
238,tequila101,"Good, but not Good Enough",7,3 August 2010,"This movie had a great plot to it, though some things about this film still annoy me and I happy to say that this film was good, it just wasn't as good as I had expected it to be.The Film is about Jason's mother who goes around killing young teens who are keeping the camp closed, Jason's Mother Pamela Voorheas wants to try and keep the camp open.I think the film was set in a good environment and background, because I like all of those forest like, wood like scenery, though I just wish that Jason was the killer instead of his mother because I do think that was just stupid. I also think that Jason could have gone on a killing spree in the first one because also 1957 & 1980, that's a freakin' long time for him to come out of the water. I also think towards the end of the film was getting too dramatic and they should have cut it out because I think the drama was way over the top. Going into the positives the film was great with it's music.This is a good film though it would never go up there with films such as Halloween or Child's Play. I would rather stick with Parts 2-4 & 6 6/10. (I still don't mind this film, just not my favorite Friday the 13th film).",Friday the 13th

241,TheRadiobox,For all its notoriety...,3,9 June 2020,"There's no doubt that the Friday the 13th franchise has made its impact on film, the horror genre, and pop-culture. However, for all of its notoriety, there isn't very much here. The story is entirely barebones, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but with all of the other pitfalls that the movie meanders right into it makes the bland story all the more noticeable.I'm sure that by this point 40 years later that people know that the original Friday has a mystery. This, alongside the practical effects by legend Tom Savini are really the only things that stand out among all the tropes and mediocre acting. The story is almost a carbon copy of Black Christmas, which was effective largely because of its villain not being a blank slate. The mystery of the identity of the killer is half-baked, but instead of being the main focus of the story where it could have been more interesting than the broad strokes we got, Friday the 13th sticks with the generic late teens and twentysomethings.The characters in Friday are entirely generic, barely even hitting the marks of archetype. The characters themselves are flimsily written; with one character ""Ned"" playing a prank on his friends, pretending that he can't swim despite being shown swimming right in front of everyone not but a minute ago. And everyone falls for it for some reason. And ""Annie"", the only half-developed character is the first to die. Everyone else is just boring. It's this kind of writing, focused on cardboard characters instead of the more interesting mystery that makes me think that no one involved with Friday the 13th cared about making a good horror movie or a good mystery or characters to care about. A character is given one to two personality traits, and then they're promptly killed. There's no room to latch onto a character, the writing attempting to cheaply fall back on basic ""oh no, a person is gonna die"" morality.Speaking of horror, the scares in the debut of the franchise are very light, with only one single scene with Kevin Bacon invoking any reaction that isn't a yawn. Since there isn't a character to get attached to here, the score is used to attempt to ratchet up the tension when the killing start coming at a consistent rate. While this score may be iconic in a vacuum, the first Friday leans too hard on its music instead of good writing.All technical aspects are... fine. Nothing stands out here either. No special shots or memorable sound design. No standout direction or anything of the sort. Everything is just mediocre at best. Accounting for everything, the immense blandness of everything just makes the missed opportunity for a more compelling story (or compelling villain) stick out much more than they would have if there was even one memorable moment here. Not to mention the absolutely glacial pace.Those involved with Friday the 13th even admitted that it was a clone of other slashers like '74s Black Christmas and '78s Halloween. That alone should tell you all you need to know. So, unless all you're after is looking at scantily-clad people; there's not much to see.31/100",Friday the 13th

243,filmfreak-5,Groundbreaking in its field!,10,12 February 2004,"I was recently hit by a big nostalgia trip and having bought the first films of this series on VHS cassette, these had to be seen aswell. They've mostly just been collecting dust in a box but watching them again have me lots of thrills... Normally I'm a bit harsh in my reviews but I really have a soft spot for this series along with the Nightmare on Elm Street series.. These films were important in the task of introducting the horror genre as we know it - wannabe followups like Scream and all the other BS cannot follow this, trust me...if you love horror but for some reason missed these films you are in for a treat!I remember watching this original film, the first one, and being tremendously disappointed. Having watched many of the later films films first and being still just a kid I failed to see what a masterpiece the film really was. I then just wanted to see people slashed, but this is actually the most creepy of them all.. I still remember getting very spooked back then aswell...A lot of acclaimed film makers, among them Steven Spielberg, called this film one of their favorite films ever, and if you see it, you know why. It's made on a very scale budget, but it works and it is really good - if you like horror films ofcourse..BUT - don't meassure this with the later Friday the 13th films. I love them tremendously too, but this film is in a league of itself. This IS actually film art, made as a horror film!!!! No kidding!",Friday the 13th
244,caseynicholson,So Much Better than Its Critics Originally Gave It Credit For,8,14 February 2015,"If you go back and look at the 1980 critical reception for the original ""Friday the 13th"", you'll find that the film was widely panned by critics, with many taking exception to the more overt gore and camera angles of the film. As I sit down to write this review some 35 years later, I find those reviews to have missed the genius of what is actually a very well made horror film.It's fair to say that Friday the 13th may not be original in its own right, with ""Halloween"" having been made two years previously. Still, ""Friday the 13th"" actually is not a typical slasher movie, as its villain is not revealed until quite late in the movie, and then we ultimately find that the antagonist in ""Friday the 13th"" is far from a Michael Myers clone, but rather more of a psychopathic profile. I find this film to be infinitely more cerebral than its ""slasher"" movie counterparts, regardless of how stereotypical its sequels may have become as the 1980's went along. And inasmuch as the camera angles may have been controversially gross at the time, with their first-person views from the angle of the killer, the convention nonetheless marks the advent of a new move in cinema, one that certainly has often been imitated even if it's seldom done as effectively as it is in the opening scene of ""Friday the 13th"".Another reason that this film is great is that it's not overdone. The acting of the teenage camp counselors may not be Oscar worthy in any given year, but the performances are strong, just the same. Betsy Palmer, who it's said was horrified to have taken on the script at all and only did it for the money, also turns out a truly strong performance, and ultimately provides one of the archetypes of the horror genre. The gritty texture of the film, visually, gives it a believable feel that transcends the decades, as does the soundtrack (even the odd mix of piano and synthesizer near the end after the film is coming to its dramatic conclusion). I say all of this as someone who is not a horror film buff, but can still appreciate horror when it is well done, and my estimation of this movie is that it is much more well done than its contemporary critics gave it credit for. 8/10 stars.",Friday the 13th
245,RickHarvey,Shouldn't be known as an classic,3,14 November 2009,"What did Friday the 13th give to the horror genre? What makes it stand out amongst the rest ? Well to be honest, it gives nothing new to the genre and it doesn't stand out amongst the best , like Halloween and TCM. It easy to say that Halloween opened the door for many Horror directors. After the huge success of Halloween, directors were given the opportunity to get there foot in the door. Sean Cunningham saw the opening and tried to make the most of it. I think why Friday the 13th stands out from the rest is because of it ending and surprising twist. These features are the reason why Friday the 13th is highly praised and remembered . Personally I thought the film was poor. I also believe that younger viewers will be left disappointed due to the fact the Iconic figure with the hockey mask doesn't feature in the film. That what I believe, I believe that the reason why everyone watches the first one is because the sequels gave the audience an iconic killer. Imagine the twist when watching it on release date, you would be surprised by it but then imagine it watching it for the first time today, expecting Jason to show up. The twist is far more surprising today than it was 29 years ago.But still, the film is pretty bad , maybe it because to me it a mindless slasher. Friday the 13th in a nutshell: friends camp at lake, friends get murdered at lake, the end. You could say the same for Halloween or TCM or in fact any slasher film but the problem is, is that Friday the 13th doesn't contain a soul of itself . There no imagination or creativity it just mindless killing, filled with gore and the gore itself isn't very impressive in today standards ( but in 1980, it was probably good ) . Halloween had the voyeurism, The shining had the physiological effect, TCM had the shocking element. These three had there own unique style while Friday the 13th seems to rip off many of other horrors .Just imagine this film as one of many other horrors, the ones that you can tell are going to be awful. When you see it on the self , just think of it as one of those awful, corny horror B movies because in fairness, Friday the 13th is pretty bad. Some of the acting is awful and corny while some is okay. Full marks for Kevin Bacon's over dramatic dive into the lake. The twist is nice but then let down because of the awful acting. I haven't watched any of the sequels but after watching this, I don't think I'll be anytime soon.",Friday the 13th

There are some great scenes, a lot of scary ones at that. Also a good story that will (hopefully) be explained some more in future entries. One moment that really got me was almost at the end of the movie. I won't spoil it here, but it's definitely one of the most unexpected moments in horror movies for me. A real shocker!Friday the 13th wasn't a disappointment at all. Sure, the acting could have been a little better on some people, but I wasn't really annoyed by it because the rest was good.

247,danielharden,The terror before the mask,5,12 June 2016,"It's Friday the 13th of June 1980 and a group of teenagers start their summer off by preparing Camp Crystal lake for a grand reopening. There is one problem though, which is that a mysterious mass murderer will not stop until every one of them is dead and Camp Crystal lake remains closed permanently. Friday the 13th is the first in the series of films that follow the murderous rampage's of Jason Voorhees, only this one is a little different than what any casual viewer would expect.The film is essentially a cliché teen horror film. There is a group of dumb teenagers to which contain the typical sexually active straight couple and the dick head character. You don't particularly care about these teens and frankly can't wait to see them die (most specifically Ned). These archetypal characters then get picked off one by one in a summer camp/ forest setting. The film is clichéd, but thinking about when the film was made it probably was one of the first to utilise these conventions alongside other films such as; John Carpenter's Halloween.What makes this film engaging is the mystery surrounding the killer. Those who no little about the franchise other than the hockey masked killer would probably be surprised by the reveal of the killer (whether a good or bad surprise depends). Sadly the mystery, aside from the shooting, unfolds poorly as the evidence embedded is brief and Betsy Palmer gets top billing.The use of the killers POV was interesting but not entirely original as it was famously used in Halloweens opening. It's still good at building tension similar to a pantomime. There is one specific POV shot that I found idiotic as the killer hides behind a tree in an area where trees are sparsely populated, the killer doesn't move and the films protagonist, Alice walks right next to this tree twice, while Bill is looking directly in the killers direction when conversing with Alice. Long story short only the visually impaired would have not noticed the middle aged woman hiding behind a tree.The teens pathetic idiotic nature is expressed several times over the course of this film. Stupid moments include when, as a prank, Ned fires an arrow at a target to which Marcie is stood right in front, and when Alice puts items in front of the door to block it but the door is a pull to open on the outside (to be fair the rope on the handle was pretty smart). Also for Christ's sake somebody put some clothes and shoes on when its pouring with rain outside.Overall, Friday the 13th is a trend setter even if that trend is considered eye rolling and laughable by everyone today. A generic teen slasher film with a kind of weak mystery. It's an of-it's-time film that can be looked back at by some with nostalgia. The film may be over but by the end, Jason's story has just begun.",Friday the 13th

254,jed-estes,A Movie To Live By 1,10,8 August 2006,"Friay Day the 13th is a film to live by because it is for me the start of the 80's and it is the film that defined the that decade. The definition of that decade being do everything Quick, Fast, and Cheap. This type of film making can be seen by almost all films of the decade unless it was made by Spielberg or Lucas or any of there clones. This movie (Friday The 13th) was shot for around $400,000 and made almost 50 million. That is a business procedure that still goes on today. Shoot cheap advertise well and the audience will come regardless of the film's integrity. Except this film has integrity unlike Roger Cormen films from the 50's on which were made just for profit. Yes I know that is in fact how this film started but that is not what it ended up being when the final project was shown before a projector bulb. When you watch the film you can see the love that went in to this monumental undertaking of cheapness. If there had not been that love then this film would have looked like another crappy film from that bygone era, like The Fog which was given a huge budget after the success of Halloween and sucked because John Carpenter brought nothing new too the table. He had to be humbled by the crap that is that film our we never would have gotten the low budget great The Thing. The same thing happened with Sean S. Cunningham after directing Friday The 13th. When he did the big budget dud Deep Star Six he was humbled, but it also killed his directing career. Now he is only a producer who is still looking for that next project that will bring him back to the spot light he deserves like Carpenter gets.

256,MovieProductions,The most overrated American slasher,5,13 September 2013,"In honor of Friday the 13th, I decided to pop in the 'ol 1980 Cunningham classic ""Friday the 13th"". I remember the first time seeing it and thinking to myself ""that was a damn good movie"". Keep in mind, I was half my age too. Even with still being a horror fan since childhood, I can easily say I don't know how the hell I liked this film the first time around considering it almost put me to sleep at about the midpoint of its running time.My biggest gripe with this Halloween rip-off (I'm quoting the director people!), is the pacing. I kid you not, there are shots of absolutely nothing filling the screen and they can run as long as five minutes. If you were to actually compile all the deaths and fights/mayhem into one movie, it'd be as long as a Youtube video.Now I'm one for character development, but these characters are some of the most unlikable people I've come across. You have your genre staples, okay I get it's a run-of-the-mill slasher, but never have I suffered this much through such wooden acting. Is it bad to say I really didn't care the final girl either?And what is up with everyone saying the kills are tremendous. If you blink, you'll miss it! Not only did the MPAA butcher the hell out of these scenes, an axe to the face is hardly what I call trend-setting. Why do I think Friday the 13th retained its notoriety? For one, the clever plot twist. I might have my gripes with the pacing/characters, but one thing is that out of all the by-the-number slasher plots, this one mixes up the formula just enough to give you a taste of something new. Also, while this film is touted for its kills, it actually racks up some decent tension in its early kills. Is it embarrassing to say I was actually on the edge of my seat at some parts? And lastly, the ending. It may be a cliffhanger, but again, it's a smart one at that. What do I think would make Friday the 13th even more of a classic? Get a new editor, fight with the MPAA until you get rights to your kills, and hire a new cast. Oh right, they did that with the new remake. Strangely enough, they're both the same (quality-wise). Well, I guess no matter if you re-make Jason, pit him against Freddy, this is just one story that (so far) has not bode well from script to silver screen. What a shame.",Friday the 13th

You almost have to take off one of your socks to count all of the sequels (and impending remake) this slasher granddaddy has spawned, and I daresay the majority of slasher films littering the genre in all the years since were constructed on the generic and simple framework of the Friday the 13th formula. Critics are still foaming at the mouth in indignation over this film all these years later, so you know it did something right. Of course, by today's standards Friday the 13th registers low (if at all) on the fright meter and really isn't all that gory, but no one can dispute the fact that this film set the stage for innumerable bloody slasher films to come.Halloween, which is technically a much superior film to this one, had already been released and made lots of money, so it's easy to see why Sean S. Cunningham (who had already cut his horror chops on The Last House on the Left) wanted to try his hand at creating a scary slasher film of his own. Cunningham did not have a big studio backing him, so he had to make this an independent, low-budget (barely more than half a million dollars) project",Friday the 13th
258,stefankrs,Great Slasher,8,15 September 2021,This movie is really underrated it isn't as bad as its ratings make it to be. The movie is a fun camp slasher in the woods with lots of fun kills and the start to an infamous slasher series with the birth of Jason. The movie is really fun and may not be great all times but it is still entertaining and just a great watch.,Friday the 13th
259,Ky-D,Start of the slasher craze.,8,1 January 2006,"'Psycho' may be the grand daddy of slasher films, 'Halloween' may be the father, but this is the sick son that hooked a whole decade of teens and spawned 10 (if you count Freddy vs. Jason) sequels, a TV series and created arguably the most recognizable horror figure of the last 20 years.Camp Crystal Lake is set to open for the first time in 20+ years, following the unsolved murders of two camp counselors. Despite warnings from the locals about it being cursed and a history of misfortune, the group of kids go about fixing the place up. As night falls and a storm rolls in, they are all about to discover that some warnings should be headed. Thus begins the 24 hour nightmare of blood.Production values are about on par with it's obvious inspiration 'Halloween', yet the film feels lower budget. Part of this is due to the somewhat empty headed dialogue and unevenness to the editing. There are also some lighting issues and some janky physical action marring the experience as well. But this is a low-budget 80's horror film, so most of that is wholly forgivable, especially given what the film does right.The two major achievements of the film are the atmosphere and the death scenes, the most important parts of any slasher film. The camp location and the woods surrounding it really do take on a life of their own, almost becoming an additional character. Combined with the pitch black storm of the second half of the movie and that great synthesized score it all makes for a perfect night for a murder.And what glorious murders they are. Slashings, stabbings, impailments, courtesy of Tom Savini, all performed with the care and detail that any other artist might put into a painting or a sheet of music. Not wanting to spoil the bits for anyone who has not gotten around to this film yet, I will just say that gore-hounds will not be disappointed.The only real hurt this film puts on the viewer comes during the final chase scene. I will not ruin the scenario by divulging details, just know that it continues for far too long, contains painfully impossible events and damn near sabotages the entire film by approaching self-parody.A quick note on the MPAA rating of the film. Yes, there is a longer, gorier cut of the film than the US R-rated version; and no, it is neither better nor must see material. The uncut version runs about 30-ish seconds longer, but the R-rated version works better as the scenes cut before the SFX start to look fake. If you absolutely must see the full version it is fairly easy to find.The film is pretty dated by modern standards, but the gore holds up well and should more than appease any and all slasher fans.8/10",Friday the 13th
260,moviemattb,Happy Friday The 13th Everyone!,9,14 July 2018,"As a child, I was not allow to watch any of these movies, as they are R rated horror flicks that contains nudity, violence, etc. I do remember one of my vague memories when ""Friday the 13th: Part 3"" came on TNN before it became Spike TV, and Paramount Network, I remember seeing Jason in a hockey mask chasing some girl at a barn. Heck, I remember when my uncle brought a copy of the movie when he rented from a video store, and I sneakily put the tape in to see Jason on an old VHS tape and seeing a brief snippet of him he did look quiet scary. After that, my mother caught me, and I turned it off. Never intend to watch it, I just only wanted to see Jason for a bit and that was it. With that said, here is my review of the first one that started it all, before Jason became the main killer, as well as putting on his iconic hockey, brought back as zombie, going to Manhattan, Hell, space, fighting Freddy Krueger, and being rebooted. The first film's plot is pretty simple, as you have a group of teenagers that are trying to reopen Camp Crystal Lake, but something evil is lurking them as it kills its victims. When I first saw this movie, I really love it, but as time goes by, I began to recognize its flaws. Nevertheless, its far from being a bad movie, and it is not the worst thing ever as critics make it out to be when it first came out. There is a lot of good things to say, where is the bad isn't that much, nor that big of a deal. To start off, I thought that Tom Savini's makeup FX are outstanding, and really is a master at it. The movie does have some great kills such as putting an axe on Jeannine Taylor's face, as well as having an arrow into Kevin Bacon's neck. The music by Harry Manfredini is completely unforgettable, he made that theme sound so iconic and everyone always like to remember that theme, when something bad is about to happen when you hear ""Ki Ki Ki Ma Ma Ma."" Totally classic. Taking place in the woods is great, and really does have that surreal atmosphere quality as you do feel somewhat unsettle as if you were alone in the woods. The characters I'll admit, aren't really three dimensional as you would seen in other great horror films, but at the end they are still likable. The acting isn't the greatest, but its really not that bad either. They all did fine for what they have to do; the best actors, in my opinion are Adrienne King and Betsy Palmer. For King, she really does have a natural beauty, and for having the girl next door type. Now for Palmer, she is having a blast with this role, and you can't take your eyes off on how fun she is for playing Jason's mother. The plot is simplistic as it needs to be, and the direction by Sean S. Cunningham is very solid. While as much as I love Palmer's performance, it would have been interesting if she had more screen time, if the audiences would have thought that she is a nice woman, before the twist ending is being revealed that she is the killer. Imagine that. Also, while I do love the character of Alice, I do notice a character error, where she runs away from Pamela Voorhees as she gets into the Jeep, but doesn't drive off as she screams by one of the victims that Pam killed. Don't get me wrong, I do love the climax, but for a realistic standpoint, she should know that the Jeep has gas in it, and could have turned the keys over so she can get herself out of there. The Jeep has gas, when Pam first arrives at the camp. Just saying. Lastly, I do love the last scene, which I'll admit, I did get jumped by the last scene, where Jason played by Ari Lehman jumps out off the water to pull Alice into the water. Very scary, to say the least. All in all, no matter what flaws this movie has, ""Friday the 13th"" is a fun thrill ride that has great kills, scare factors, unforgettable music, and likable characters. I'm giving this movie a 9 out of 10.",Friday the 13th

It did two things right that surprised me. Number one: the music is pretty solid. It was very tension filled and I liked it. Number two: they didn't show the bad guy till the very end. For once, a horror movie realized that fear of the unknown is way more terrifying than cheap jump scares. This movie has its fair share of drawbacks though. It condones some of the age old horror movie clichés (nudity/sex= death, car doesn't start, two left feet, etc.), and the end is just all around terrible. Every action the remaining character takes is stupid and the fight scenes look terrible. With all this combined, I can say Friday the 13th isn't the worst, but it really isn't all that good either. 5/10.",Friday the 13th

264,thelastblogontheleft,Slasher Classic,7,15 December 2016,"It feels almost redundant to post a review of a movie as iconic as this one, but here goes. I assume 99% of people reading this have seen it already, but if not, watch out for spoilers, yo.Friday the 13th (which was almost titled Long Night at Camp Blood) may not have been anyone's pet project — the director, Sean S. Cunningham, admitted that it was an attempt to ride off the success of John Carpenter's Halloween, which was released two years prior, and the writer, Victor Miller, wrote the script in two weeks — but it's a cult classic for a reason. It didn't do that well when it was first released — it made about $39 million at box office but received many negative reviews, including a particularly scathing commentary from Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert (who didn't even bother to hide the ending from readers). And, technically speaking, it's not that amazing of a movie — some forgettable characters, mostly weak dialogue. But it continues to gain popularity even to this day.It's really a classic slasher flick. A bunch of young counselors have arrived at camp early to help set up and are murdered one by one by a mysterious killer. It's got the short shorts, the stormy night, and the obligatory sex scene (with Kevin Bacon and the stunning Jeannine Taylor, no less). But you really do feel the tension mounting as the movie progresses, partially due to the use of music by Harry Manfredini.As soon as Annie — innocent, freckled little Annie — gets her throat slit in the woods, I was immediately reminded of how surprisingly good the murder scenes are. They aren't over the top gory and aren't drawn out too long — it's just a quick, efficient kill and then on to the anticipation of the next one.I liked that we never saw a hint of the killer beyond maybe their feet, or a hand on a shower curtain — it's really effective in adding to the already tense mood, not to mention, of course, hiding the surprise reveal until the very end. Speaking of which, I really enjoyed the twist — again, SPOILER ALERT, but y'all know this already. Having the killer be Mrs. Voorhees was just awesome. Exacting revenge on behalf of her son, neglected by camp counselors while he drowned in the lake brilliant. And her talking with herself — or talking ""with Jason"" — was creepily well done. It may not be my favorite classic horror movie — of the trio (Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street), I'm wayyyy more of a Freddy girl.",Friday the 13th

270,tmpj,Cheap thrills...cheap shots...in this piece of crap !,4,3 April 2010,"Giving this ""film"" a 4 rating is very generous to my thinking. It ranks as one of the very worst on my list ( I enjoyed ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" more than this!). Though , true, it made money for a very troubled Paramount and, true, it did wonders for Betsy Palmer and Kevin Bacon in terms of recognition, my position remains steadfast. It is a piece of crap, and was one of the films that put cinema--or aspects of it--on a decided course...a ""race to the bottom"". This film was more of a chore and a bore...and I am only horrified by its success at the box office. It was a very difficult watch...there is no order to the storyline, and I did not care what the heck happened to most of the characters, as they seemed to be jerks and bimbos. Manfredini's music score borrowed heavily from Bernard Herrmann's famous music cues for ""Psycho"", and I was appalled by the un-original touch his screeching strings let out, allegedly heightening the terror of the scene...but failing to do so successfully. This film failed to deliver, I would not want to see it or any of its derivatives ever again, and...it helped give ""bad movies"" a new definition.",Friday the 13th
271,RomanJamesHoffman,"Despite not being that good, part of the slasher canon",5,27 November 2012,"We all know the story: a group of horny good-looking teens (and token geek) forgo common sense and adult supervision and, on a day of portentous note, are routinely slaughtered...usually after being so morally bankrupt as to have had pre-marital sex. Even if you haven't seen 'Friday the 13th' itself you have almost certainly seen a movie which is basically the same. Okay, 'Friday the 13th' can excuse itself from the charge of being clichéd due to the fact that it was the very success of the movie that established the clichés we have come to be so bored of. However, what it can't save itself from is the charge of just not being a good movie.Inspired by the box-office success John Carpenter's 'Halloween' enjoyed a couple of years previously, Sean Cunningham (previously known for producing Wes Craven's video nasty 'Last House on the Left') borrowed elements from films such as Mario Bava's 'Bay of Blood', DePalma's 'Carrie', Bob Clark's 'Black Christmas', and the aforementioned 'Halloween', and managed to codify the fledgling slasher genre into the trope-ridden cliché fest we have had to suffer since. This was done with the help of a one-dimensional approach to direction and script which stripped away any semblance of complexity or genuine suspense (save a couple of moments), and the lack of development of the maniac-fodder characters who, at any rate, are expressed with corny acting. The film only really distinguishes itself by its kills which, in ramping up the gore to 11 courtesy of special effects maestro Tom Savini, are pretty cool. However, existing in isolation from anything else of technical note (specifically the lack of character development) sanitises any horror and makes the film funny which (intentional or not) detracts significantly from any atmosphere it could have had.However, while I don't rate the film in terms of quality (and would recommend any of the previously mentioned films for the true would-be horror-phile) there's no denying the impact the film had in both establishing beyond doubt the slasher genre as a viable commercial form (and opening the door for some quite interesting slashers that followed) and also destroying the genre (as quite a lot of truly pale imitations also came through that door) and as a result it is basically a set text for those wishing to explore the realm of late 70s/early 80s American horror.",Friday the 13th

273,legendaryunderdog,Setting the standard for horror films to this day.,9,13 July 2007,"Film critic Leonard Maltin once said that the reason why kids back in 1980 were scoring low on SAT's nationwide was that because they were filling up seats of theaters that were showing ""Friday the 13th"", meaning he had no clue as to why these kids would find this movie slightly entertaining. Numerous sequels and millions of dollars of box-office money later, I believe Maltins words at this point are irrelevant. This movie was a genuine shocker to me, Sean Cunningham had previous experience in trauma/make you feel creeped out flicks working with legendary filmmaker Wes Craven on ""The Last House on The Left"" which is probably more terrifying than Friday the 13th but Cunningham showed in this movie that he hadn't lost his touch nor flair for filmaking yet. Betsy Palmer turns in a great performance as the obsessed/oppressed mother of a child who drowned as a boy. Adrienne King does a good job as Alice (the main character) and we can't forget good 'ol Kevin Bacon, we love ya man. This movie really got the slasher flick ball rollin' real quick, many greats followed such as ""The Burning"" ""The Prowler"" ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and so on and so forth. I personally prefer the 2nd installment (part 2) because of the inclusion of Jason but this movie still gives me creeps.

Because of their hormones, a little boy (Jason) drowned in the lake. One year later 2 kids who were doing, you guessed it screwing their heads off, for having sex. Flash forward to today. Steve Christy wants to open the camp after 10 years for children. Several of camp counselers come up one week early to help Steve fix the place up. When Steve leaves to go to town all hell breaks loose. It starts to storm, strange things begin to happen, and one by one the adults get hacked into pieces.  Who will live and who is the killer?

277,A-Ron-2,What went wrong with cinema... ?,5,12 July 2000,"With that title I am sure most people will expect me to say that I hate this film... I assure you I do not.  I snuck into see this film when I was about 9 or 10, the second film had already come out and everyone was talking about it (I had an cousin who was 4 years older than me and he would describe the kill scenes in these movies in gory detail... I was enthralled).  If you want my defense for why I watch these movies, read my review for John Carpenter's Halloween, here I will stick to the first Friday film.The movie has no Jason in it, in fact it is almost an intelligent thriller (almost), but it wallows in its own exploitiveness too thoroughly to be that.  However, this film does have a certain charm to it, I don't really know why.  I still rent it about once every couple of years, I still watch it and still find myself amused 20 years later (I can't believe that this film is 20 years old, where is the 20th anniversary, digitally enhanced re-release? ;), but I can't really explain why.This film obviously has become one of those 'rites of passage' movies that all teenage boys must see in order to be considered cool (maybe girls too, I dunno).   I guess that this is enough to keep it culturally viable, but there must be something else to it.  I would get into issues about the sexual revolution, the confusion of the late 70s and the dawning of Reagan era, but I don't really want to bore anyone.  Ultimately, no matter how lame this film is, it will always have an audience, and no matter how old I get, I continue to go and see these films, even when I know that they will be terrible.  I guess ultimately the kill scenes and the boob shots are something for adolescent males to talk about, and adult males to remember what it was like to be an adolescent male. 
Overall, while I cannot really recommend this movie to people, I know I don't have to.  I know people will go and see it anyway, which is good I suppose, since I really do have a soft place in my heart for these goofy, gory, misogynistic violence-fests.  I don't know why, but they are part of my history and I can't bring myself to deny them.  And most of you probably can't either ;)",Friday the 13th

That can be the only explanation why this marginal at best horror film made millions and spawned so many sequels which were even worse then this.It's not a terrible movie. It's not the worst horror film I have ever seen. It's a bad movie though. It is ineptly directed and written, the editing is so choppy you will swear you are on a boat, and the acting is just terrible. The casting director must have cast the actors based on their looks without having them read a line. The film is needlessly bloody to a fault. Do we really need to see an arrow in someone's eye?

But if you dig deeper into the birth of slasher movies, you can go a bit earlier to 1971 with the foreign film by Mario Bava called ""Bay of Blood"" aka ""Twitch of the Death Nerve"". But, it was ""Friday the 13th"" that was the pied piper that would lead an endless list of great (and not so great) slasher films in the early '80s. It basically blasted the sub-genre of slasher horror from it's cabin door hinges! So, enough about the origins of the slasher era, we'll get to the classic that is Friday THE 13th! The film is next to perfect in it's execution (haha, no pun intended?). A decent cast for what you're gonna get in a low budget picture like this. They really lucked out with Kevin Bacon. And Betsy Palmer really stole the show as the worst mother in movie history since Faye Dunaway's role as Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest""! The atmosphere is great, and the location where it was filmed is the best out of any Friday the 13th movie (the worst location being part 3...was THAT mudhole even a lake?). The good thing about this movie (as opposed to the many artless imitations out there) is that the tension builds gradually until it hits a grand apex. This, however, is one of the things some people find annoying about this movie, but unless you have ADHD then you will follow the story as it gains momentum. I won't get into a detailed description of the plot itself in this review(everyone should know the plot by now),I just wanted to take the time to point out the greatness of this film in the horror universe. Further, the ending is the still one of the most frightening and heart stopping moments in horror history! No one can deny that.There are a few things that taint this otherwise flawless piece of work, and that is the highly edited death scenes. I know that it was the MPAA that did it and not the director or anyone involved in the film, but I think they should have tried to get away with a lot more. There are simply too many off-screen murders! Out of 10 deaths, 5 of them are off screen which is mainly because they couldn't get away with showing the scene because it was ""too violent"" and also because the effects didn't work out the way they were intended. I have read that Brenda's death scene was originally her being impaled by a few arrows while standing in the rain at the archery, but it was cut by the MPAA. Marcie's face axing scene was intended to be shown without any film cuts which means you would have seen the ax hit her face, but they couldn't get the effects just right to do it that way so they had to cut away to the ax, then show her fall to the floor with the ax in her face (still turned out very well). The quick cuts of the death scenes is another annoyance (once again you can thank the MPAA), you get no more than a full second of screen time on any given end result of a gore killing. The one standout gore scene in the whole movie goes to the death of Kevin Bacon's character Jack who gets an arrow through the neck from the killer hiding under the bed (a scenario that creeped me out as a kid!) They show everything, and the fact that they didn't have computer graphics back then really showed the filmmaker's creativity in doing these death scenes from scratch. BUT don't even try to watch this on network TV, because you may not even notice you're watching a horror film. It's overly (and needlessly) edited of all gore.Although some of it's sequels may surpass this film's body count, visual effects, and coolness factor, they will never match the sheer shock value that this movie possesses. And that is simply why this is the best one in the series.",Friday the 13th

It's just one gory murder after another, a feeble cash-in on the superior 'Halloween'.  There's not a sympathetic victim in the film so you couldn't care less what happens to anyone.  In fact some of the teenagers are so downright obnoxious you often find yourself applauding when they're finally dispensed with after the obligatory wandering around calling out 'is anyone there?' in monotonous fashion.  Things are very boring and slow-moving, virtually the only worthwhile part of the film being its climax out on the lake.  Mrs Voorhees is effective and actually comes across as the one character in the film who approaches being sympathetic.  The music has its ups and downs.  The climax/closing credits tune is great, but the music during the opening credits sounds like someone honking a car horn.It has to be mentioned that the worst part of the film is a harmless snake being brutally chopped up in loving detail by one of the teenagers, after which one of his cronies makes a comment about 'knowing what's for dinner'. This whole scene made me want to be physically sick.  Whatever possessed Cunningham into thinking people would give a damn about these characters?",Friday the 13th

284,henrymadman,10/10,10,7 July 2007,"Friday the 13th is a 1980 independent slasher film directed by Sean S. Cunningham and written by Victor Miller.Although the film was poorly received by most, if not all, mainstream film critics, it went on to become one of the most popular slasher films in cinema history, and was the first movie of its kind to secure distribution by a major studio (Paramount Pictures). The film's box office success led to a long series of sequels.Production Friday the 13th was produced by Sean S. Cunningham, who had previously worked with filmmaker Wes Craven on the film The Last House on the Left. Cunningham was inspired by the success of John Carpenter's influential Halloween, and conceived Friday the 13th as an exploitation film that would cash-in on the success of Halloween. Ironically, Friday the 13th became a huge box-office hit, caused even more slasher films to be made, and spawned a seemingly unending franchise of sequels.The script was written by Victor Miller, who has gone on to write for several television soap operas, including Guiding Light, One Life to Live, and All My Children. Miller delighted in inventing a serial killer who turned out to be somebody's mother, a murderer whose only motivation was her love for her child. ""...I took motherhood and turned it on its head and I think that was great fun. Mrs. Voorhees was the mother I'd always wanted - a mother who would have killed for her kids."" Miller was unhappy about the filmmakers' decision to add Jason Voorhees to the film, making him leap out of the lake at the end to grab the heroine. ""Jason was dead from the very beginning. He was a victim, not a villain."" The idea of Jason appearing at the end of the film was not in the original script, and was actually suggested by makeup designer Tom Savini. Savini said ""The whole reason for the cliffhanger at the end was I had just seen Carrie, so we thought that we need a 'chair jumper' like that and I said, 'let's bring in Jason.'"".",Friday the 13th
285,onnanob2,It will always be a favorite horror flick!,7,15 August 2002,"""Friday The 13th"" was well-hated by film critics when it was released to theaters in 1980. Many film critics blasted Paramount Pictures for releasing the movie, and they also tried to shame Betsy Palmer for her role in the movie. The movie was also slammed along with other slasher movies as violence against women, but this is incorrect with ""Friday The 13,"" because more men are murdered than women. The movie made a lot of money at the box office, which resulted in several sequels. The plot is very simple (SPOILERS ahead): a killer is stalking the staff of a summer camp; killing them one by one until there is one staff member left. That staff member (Adrienne King) must battle the killer to save her life.  The plot was meant to be simple, but thought and care went into the low-budget production. The movie was well filmed, and the night scenes are nicely atmospheric. Other nice atmospheric touches are squeaking doors, and the sounds in the forest that surround the summer camp. There's even a nicely done thunderstorm as the evening turns into a night of terror. The acting is mostly average and the movie does have its shortcomings, but I gladly overlook them because I have enjoyed this movie over and over. The original music by Harry Manfredini is creepy, and quite effective. Tom Savini created the gruesome special effects for the murders that are shown. It is interesting that ""Friday The 13th"" was one of Kevin Bacon's first movies. Betsy Palmer appearing as a maniac was also interesting, and quite a switch from her previous film and television appearances. Also of interest is that Bing Crosby's son, Harry Crosby, had starred in such a movie. ""Friday The 13th"" is a low-budget and simple shocker that succeeds in entertaining. It will always be a favorite horror flick of mine! This film is rated R, and contains graphic violence, gore, drug use, sexuality, and nudity.",Friday the 13th
286,nightwatch4773,Thank You Mario Bava for inspiring Sean Cunningham!!!,8,26 March 2013,"Back in the early 70's 10 years before the slasher craze in the United States, Mario Bava from Italy created a film that would be the apparatus for slasher horror for years to come. That film was Twitch of the Death Nerve ( released on VHS under the dubious title Bay of Blood ). This film really introduced the stalk and slash that would become the landscape for American horror for almost two decades. Friday the 13th was born at the dawn of the 1980's and was followed by a myriad of sequels. This the original still holds up today as a creepy piece of slasher celluloid and features a young Kevin Bacon meeting his demise.

After watching The Exorcist this movie was very refreshing. I can't compare between the two. The Exorcist and Friday the 13th are very different movies. But after the chills that the Exorcist sent up my spine watching a slasher-flick (which The Exorcist is not) was very refreshing.
Of course I already knew who the killer was because they have to mention this movie in every post Scream movie and Dawson's Creek episode but it didn't ruin it for me. This movie did deliver chills and was very much worth watching. The acting was not bad for a horror movie. I really started liking Annie, in fact I thought the movie would revolve around her, boy was I wrong. The end was a bit strange and ruined the very possibility of 'realistic' in this movie but I don't regret watching- hey look what a fuss it started!",Friday the 13th

The camp's new owner and several young counsellors are readying the property for re-opening despite warnings of a ""death curse"" by local residents. The curse proves true as one by one each of the counsellors is stalked by a violent killer. This film is widely acclaimed for it's horrifying and creative murder sequences.This film starred Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King & Kevin Bacon.This was the start of the Friday The 13th movies which consists of 10 films + a remake and if you want to count it Freddy Vs Jason.

290,briandwillis-83825,A Classic of Indie Filmmaking,7,21 October 2020,"While it no doubt started a huge trend (maybe even more so than Halloween), Friday the 13th is a modest little movie that's not even that well made or revolutionary in its storytelling. It takes the low budget grit and realism of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Black Christmas, and other low budget horrors of the 70's and mixes it with an Agatha Christie whodunnit angle. The killer reveal (which is still so great that I hesitate to reveal it due to spoilers) wasn't that novel either and several people of that type had been depicted as killers before.Even the film's gripping chair jumper finale was lifted from Carrie. So, what was it that made this one so special? There had been gore on screen before, but it was always of the bright red, candy colored variety and not particularly realistic. It was Tom Savini's realistic effects that really offered something different and unique that we'd never seen before and he's probably the true unsung genius in this film.",Friday the 13th

The silent, unseen killer is genuinely scary. When its identity is revealed, the actor gives full justice. The younger cast are keen and likable. The ""Prophet of Doom"" fits the role perfectly.

296,theterminator-92378,Iconic masterpiece of horror,8,29 September 2017,The entire movie plays on fear of the killer getting our councilors and it proves that POV shots from the killer are effective to see when they are going to kill. the cast were great at being what they were suppose to be teenagers who are enjoying a summer job. Kevin Bacon and Betsy Palmer were two stars who shone in their roles but the overall story line made up one of the most iconic horror movie franchise of all time and while their is a lack of the iconic Jason Vorhees any fan of the series will be happy to tell you that's not the last you will see of him. The movie does what it's supposed to and gives us gore and violence and that's what i would expect from a horror.

297,TheMichaelMyersMovieFanatic,Suprisingly special and scary!,7,13 September 2019,"Friday the 13th is a classic masterpiece, it uses a clever sort of storytelling to hide the identity of the killer as well as who the main character is to the end. For a slasher movie, it's not as bloody as a modern slasher, but it still delivers brutal kills. The music and sound effects are all great. The suspense-building is great as you can kinda figure out when someone's is going to get murdered. And without spoiling anything, the acting of the killer is truly terrifying! Some acting is kind of cheesy but that doesn't change mutch. It has a great atmosphere and after rewatching it, Friday the 13th from 1980 is now one of my favourite horror movies of all time! Overall it's a must see movie with a score of 9/10 from me!",Friday the 13th
298,LagerLagerLagerShouting,Am I The Only One Who Hates The 1st One!?,3,30 April 2008,"Supposedly the film along with Halloween that kicked off the 80's slasher franchise, Friday the 13th is nothing but a preposterous, stupid rip-off of John Carpenter's brilliant horror masterpiece. True, the familiar slasher hallmarks are developed further, for example: the promiscuous teenagers, the wise oracle who warns them of the impending danger, the isolated woodland setting and notably in this the gore by the legendary Tom Savini. But none of this means anything unless the key ingredient of the slasher, the killer, is convincing and lets face it pretty darn menacing. This is ruined by the most ridiculous killer of the 80's slasher film influx and throw in unconvincing, cliché slasher fodder and pretty unoriginal, predictable direction from Last House on the Left producer Sean Cunningham and you have a total waste of time. The series definitely got better when Jason appeared!3/10",Friday the 13th

301,DorianWynHowells,This film does deliver some genuine shocks.,6,22 January 2002,"It has to be said...this film is good for what it does.The storyline is ever so simple, a kid drowns in Camp Crystal Lake and ever since then, someone has been killing anyone who comes near there.HERE'S THE PLOT TWIST, AND THERE ARE A FEW MORE!!! **** the killer is the mother of the kid. Mrs Voorhees.No-one expected the twist, it was quite a good way to surprise us as a viewewr. But why oh why do the killer's ALWAYS have to tell us the reasons why they kill in such OTT performance's? Look at later films such as Scream - OTT. Urban Legends - OTT. It becomes laughable.*** But, nonetheless, the mother's reason's are understandable, but then again, the death of her son has got absolutely nothing to do with the new batch of students who have come to 'Camp Blood'. Of course, if she thought that, then we wouldn't have a film!!!Good for what it does, being a film from the early early 80's, and redefining the 'slasher' genre, this film delivers some very good shocks and some gruesome deaths. Of course, the killings all occur on the fateful date Friday the 13th.  All the cast are unknowns, so we don't know who, if any will survive the film. That's always a good thing, it keeps us guessing. When I first watched this film, I convinced myself that the first character we see in the 'present' day would be the main character. Shame really, cos she was kinda cute. That's what happens when you have a cast of unknowns.Some of the deaths/murders are quite unexpected and shocking, although they're a little bit dated, don't hold that against it.This film, although not totally unique, does deliver a few good shocks and as I've said, the end twist is a nice touch. Another nice touch is the definite ending. *** Now we weren't expecting THAT!!! Jason makes an appearance, as a child!!!!So the director left an open opportunity for a sequel?? Judging by this first installment, it might be quite good.6/10",Friday the 13th

303,Jsimpson5,The start of it all,6,29 October 2007,"The 1980's saw the rise of the Slasher film sub genre and many films were created as a result. Most of those are still well known for this day and countless remakes and sequels were made as well. One of the more notable slasher films out there is Friday the 13th, and this short review will be talking about the film that started it all.The basic idea of this story was that a group of teenagers go to this old camp as a counselor retreat. They go to Camp Crystal Lake for the weekend. Various people tell the teenagers not to go there since it's cursed and people have been killed there.A bad storm arrives and one by the one the counselors are killed off by a killer.I won't give away the rest of the story, it's better to watch the film. When this film came out it was pretty scary which was 27 years ago. By today's standards it's a fairly tame film. It's kinda like Psycho when it came out in the 60's. It was shocking back then, but now it's kidna the norm to have stuff like that in a film, so it's not shocking.The script could be better along with the acting. Overall it's not a bad film and if you haven't seen it, then I would suggest that you either buy or rent it.",Friday the 13th

This film should be judged as if none of the other F the 13th films have occurred yet.  The make-up is awesome in this film, no CGI to help make it look real.  The scariest part in the film to me is when the axe raises up behind Annie in the bathroom.  You know what is coming, but you can't even breathe.  I give this movie a 6/10 based upon the realness of the setting.  Summer camps back in 1979 were supposed to be dirty, with no TV, and you would have to walk to the bathroom with your flashlight.  The acting is sub-par for the most part.  Mrs. Voorhies and Alice give good performances which make up for a frantic and scary 15 minutes.",Friday the 13th
308,eytand94,"Ch, ch, ch. Ah, ah, ah. ""Friday the 13th"" is classic slasher fare!",10,21 August 2009,"After ""Psycho"" in 1960, 1978's ""Halloween"" was a major hit due to its truly frightening premise and terrifying villain. So, other directors wanted to try and make their own ""Halloween""-style film. The first to come out was Sean Cunningham's 1980 horror hit ""Friday the 13th."" The plot: Ever since the terrible coincidences in 1958, Camp Crystal Lake has been shut down and hidden for years. Now, it is finally being reopened, and for Alice, Bill, Jack, Marcie, Brenda, Ned and Annie, it's going to be a dream come true being the counselors at the camp. But they didn't listen to the locals when they warned them that they were all doomed if they didn't get out. And today is Friday the 13th. And an unknown assailant is stalking the campsite, killing the counselors one by one. Who could it be? What do they want? And can Alice stop them? ""Friday the 13th"" has everything you want in a slasher movie: Tons of gore, a few scares, likable teens, including a good heroine, and a little bit of nudity, if you like that sort of thing.Featuring Tom Savini's classic gore effects, great music, and a gigantic cult following, ""Friday the 13th"" gave birth to over 11 sequels and a re-imagining of the film.

309,Milo-Jeeder,"Capitalizing on the success of ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th"" manages to stand out with its own merits",8,4 June 2018,"Clearly, the team behind ""Friday the 13th"" expected at least to make a reasonable profit out of it, but I seriously doubt that anyone involved in the making of this film even considered the possibility of it becoming the cult classic that it is today. Victor Miller, who wrote the story, openly admitted that he was riding off the success of Halloween (1978). The late actress Betsy Palmer even claimed that, after reading the script, she thought the story was trash (well... she actually used another word), but she took the job because she needed a new car. Little did she know when she took the role that her character would immortalize her as one of the biggest horror icons of all times.Yes, it is evident that Victor Miller and Don Mancini capitalized on the success of Halloween (1978), but the truth is that ""Friday the 13th"" manages to stand out on its own, and in the end, other than being two slasher films about a killer who prowls around murdering teenagers; these two films don't really have that much in common. To this day, John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is considered a more ""serious"" horror film (for the lack of a better word), while ""Friday the 13th"" remains a classic, but is still seen as a less underappreciated respectable flick. Why? Probably because, even though I absolutely love it, I will admit that ""Friday the 13th"" certainly has a campy nature (no pun intended). In my case, I don't mind the campiness, I actually enjoy it.In ""Friday the 13th"", the story begins in 1958, in a summer camp named Camp Crystal Lake. We see two young camp counselors who are about to have sex, when someone appears out of nowhere and murders them both. We don't get to see who the killer is, since the murders are shown in a point-of-view shot, and the reason behind the murders is not yet explained either. The story then jumps to 1980 and it focuses on Alice, a young and sensible girl who, along with other kids of her age, is hired as a counselor by a man who attempts to reopen Camp Crystal Lake. Unfortunately, someone doesn't seem too thrilled about the reopening of the place, which will lead to a series of gruesome murders. Could it be the same person who killed those two counselors back in 1958? In the end, it is Alice who will have to come face to face with the killer and fight for her own life.Spoilers aheadPlot-wise, ""Friday the 13th"" may not be too remarkable, but it doesn't really need to be either. I could be wrong, but I believe this film first introduced the formula that consists on: a summer camp as a scenario, a pinch of mystery, plentiful gore, creative deaths and a gratifying reveal towards the last minutes. Just like this film attempted to ride off the success of a previous slasher, ironically, ""Friday the 13th"" itself ended up generating a bunch of (arguably) inferior clones as well. Of course, commercial success doesn't necessarily imply quality, but I do think ""Friday the 13th"" has a certain something that makes it appealing to a lot of people.For the most part, the characters in this film seem somewhat generic and one dimensional, which is a common attribute in slasher films. There really isn't much of a character development, and we don't get to know them very well. Most of the victims are young boys and girls who seem to be in the camp to have a good time themselves, rather than working hard to make the children happy. Surely, these characters don't really deserve to die for being immature and silly, but at the same time, it is hard to feel too bad for them either. However, the first character that gets killed after the time-jump seems genuinely sweet and caring, so one obviously feels bad for her when she is brutally murdered, just for being naïve enough to trust a stranger. I think this death after the time-jump was a perfect move, because it sets the tone perfectly for what is going to happen later: a bunch of innocent young people will be brutally murdered without having done anything to deserve it.The acting in ""Friday the 13th"" is mostly plain or, in some cases, over the top, which, along with the silly dialogs and lines, provides the film with an enjoyable campy nature. The late Betsy Palmer, who played the role of Mrs. Pamela Voorhees, was nominated for a Razzie Award, and while I love the character of Mrs. Voorhees and I felt bad to hear about Palmer's passing, I can understand why she was nominated. It's true, Betsy's portrayal of Jason's mother is over the top and it can appear as unintentionally funny during her delivery of some of her lines, but at the same time, I'm not sure if I can imagine the character being played differently at this point. Then we have Crazy Ralph, literally jumping out of a closet, telling the kids to leave, because they're doomed and that Camp Crystal Lake has a death curse. This character, aside from being called ""Crazy"" Ralph, (in case anyone didn't notice that he was crazy in the first place), is perhaps one of the campiest characters in the slasher subgenre, which earned him an iconic place in the franchise and even a small part in the first sequel.""Friday the 13th"" offers a nice variety of gory murders, with Tom Savini in charge of the makeup effects, which is an undeniable seal of quality. The legendary ""axe in the face"" death scene is perhaps one of the most memorable parts of the film for many fans. In this scene, Sean Cunningham and Tom Savini not only offer a morbidly satisfying and shocking on-screen death, we also get a lot of tension and suspense preceding the murder, which creates a feeling of panic and desperation.The final confrontation between Alice, our final girl, and Mrs. Voorhees, Jason's vengeful mother is really extensive for a good cause, as it helps to build a lot of tension that culminates with a gruesome murder. To some extent, when Mrs. Voorhees suddenly appears out of nowhere and begins to tell the story of what happened to that ""poor boy"", it is easy to assume that she is responsible for the carnage, or at least, that she is involved to a certain degree. Up until this point, we had never seen her before throughout the entire film, so why is she popping out now? There are no other supporting characters left to blame for the murders and Mrs. Voorhees shows up the exact moment when things got really ugly? What could she be doing at Camp Crystal Lake in the middle of the night, other than murdering boys and girls? Of course, our final girl, even though she is not unintelligent, seems to be somewhat oblivious of what is really happening and this is what makes up want to scream ""Get out of there!"". Mrs. Voorhees is basically explaining the whole story to the audience, but at the same time, she is subtly revealing herself as the killer, before going into a weird trance, in which she starts talking as if she is possessed by Jason, her own son, who drowned at the lake (I always considered this like a switched version of Norman Bates and his mother).As mentioned before, the acting in this final confrontation is not exactly brilliant and the audience ends up getting more than they probably needed to understand the story, since Mrs. Voorhees' monologue basically goes into detail of what happened, just to make sure we get it right (just like when they make sure that we understand that Ralph is a crazy old man, by calling him ""Crazy Ralph"").

It was made shortly after Halloween was released. I just don't know why this was made. The plot has a bunch of dumb counselers getting killed in this camp. It doesn't have acting. I don't think they even had a script. My home movies have better acting than this. The only thing it has to offer is a few good looking gore effects. The axe-in-the-face was cool. That's it though. Most people will like this movie and hate me for not liking it but I don't know what you see in this crap. It's stupid, and has no point what so ever. It's unrealistic too. You can't drown and come back to life. Maybe they should have just made this into a sci-fi or something. Friday the 13th: D-",Friday the 13th

When Jason is drowned at Camp Crystal Lake, he comes back from the dead as a grown man wearing a mask who hunts down unsuspecting camp counsellors in revenge for what happened to him.Each person is picked off one by one by Jason in horrendous ways and in the end you should not expect things to turn out happy.Friday the 13th was written by Victor Miller and was initiated from the movie Halloween's previous success. The movie was released by Warner Bros and Paramount Pictures. The movie was made on a budget of $550,000 and made over $39.7 million at the U.S box office which is every movie makers dream come true. Friday the 13th will get your scare nerves going, even though currently the world has become desensitized to more original horror movies, Friday the 13th Part One is still a good horror classic. - Asif Zamir",Friday the 13th

You can tell it was made on a small budget, and as a result, several of the scenes are very dark and grainy.However, the story is classic. Someone is slaughtering camp counselors at Camp Crystal Lake one by one, in graphic fashion. The killer's identity isn't revealed (or telegraphed, despite what some naysayers think...) until the final act, when the killer is pitted against the final counselor. The finale is very tense and well filmed, especially those last few seconds of slow motion.The FX by Tom Savini are first rate, and the atmosphere of the film is excellent.If you forgot how it all began, sit down and prepare to be shocked!",Friday the 13th
314,jhigginbotham151,Barebones slasher copied hundreds of times,6,12 May 2014,"Friday The 13th is the film that you have seen hundreds of times. If Halloween created the modern slasher film, then Friday The 13th stripped it down and perfected a formula that all future installments and many imitators would follow, even to this day. Now I enjoy this film, I give this a high rating but do admit that the film, if viewed without the knowledge that it was really the first of its kind, will seem boring and stale. However I think this film does offer a different experience to the other classics of horror like Elm Street,Texas Chainsaw and its closest counterpart Halloween.Unlike Halloween, Friday doesn't give you any reason whatsoever to care for these character. They never offer any exposition of themselves or each other, all we are given is the first impressions of them. People like to make the joke today of describing every character with a quirk, or their type. The virgin, the jerk, the nerd, the hot girl. All of them are defined by this statement and nothing else which, if you want, can mean you can identify with the quirk and project yourself on to that character, or like me you can choose to use these quirks as ways to know which character just died a brutal, gory death. The music cues, the POV deaths etc, it all gives the film a strange feeling of you yourself being the killer. Nobody really realised that but this is one of the only classic horror films that truly makes you feel like the killer. You spend most of your time with the teenagers, but you never learn anything about them and you actually come to hate most of them because of their utter stupidity and general likability. This all combines us so by the end, that last girl, the virgin, is on your death list, you want her dead and you don't no why. Strange isn't itOverall, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, A Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday The 13th, this film truly deserves to be part of the big 4 of modern Horror, its simple yet effective and it will continue to be the source of inspiration for many budding filmmakers for years to come.",Friday the 13th
315,phoenixyk1,The start of a craze that knows no end,8,28 September 2014,"How can this be??? I was born in 1973, and now it is 2014 and I have ONLY JUST WATCHED ALL THE Friday THE 13TH FILMS??? SAD OR WHAT?So, lets begin at the beginning... There is no doubt that the Slasher Genre was born with Hitchcock's PSYCHO - But the Teen Slasher movie owes its birth to This one.The story follows a simple pattern... A Summer Camp is reopened years after some grisly murders took place, with a legend of a child who drowned having come back from the grave to take revenge on those he held responsible for his death...Cue lots of suspense and many deaths...It is now a very dated movie, but I have to say that if Hollywood wants to keep producing horror movies, then it needs to start paying attention to what makes this film work even now.As with Ridley Scotts ALIEN, Much of the film is about Suspense - There are long periods where frankly not much is happening, but there is enough done to make the mind think ""OOoooo... We are about to see a killing"" when its nothing more than a ploy... And its these ploys, and the camera work that allows you to see vast areas that make it such a draw.There is an understanding of the human Psyche and how we view the world... The old idea of when you sit at home and swear by all the souls you just seen something out of the corner of your eye when nothing is there...The film has these moments in abundance - And it works, It adds to the tension as you wait for the Killer to strike.Another good touch is that the deaths are not overboard... Creative yes, but not blood and guts for the sheer hell of it. Its time Hollywood learnt and viewers began to accept that Lots of Blood does not equal SCARY. In fact it ruins the illusion!So, a nice story build up... Deaths a plenty and a Legendary Character that people have been talking about for years since its release, EXCEPT......And yes, I was actually shocked as EVERYONE talked about Jason Voorhee's when I was young - But he is NOT THE KILLER!!! Its his MOTHER!!!I still cannot decide if this was a let down or a nice twist... As usual, A lone survivor and frankly on of the BEST JUMP SCARES EVER!!! Again, a lesson for Hollywood - Jump Scare are good but only if you PLAY with expectation - Which this film did! You know its coming... It is so obvious... BUT its so drawn out and slow in coming that I can honestly say that I almost dropped my Laptop!!! (Other than my sister, My family are wimps and hate Horror movies...)While effects wise it has not stood the test of time, this film still has the power to deliver some very real scares. A lesson in how to make a PROPER horror movie.If Hollywood is going to start scaring us again - Its time it learnt to go back to basics and get rid o the blood and guts Torture porn!",Friday the 13th
316,Aomalle27,The first and best of the series,6,29 April 2008,"This wasn't really a re-imagining of the horror genre, nor the start of the slasher craze, but this film, along with Halloween certainly made the slasher genre mainstream, successful, and truly marketable to a large segment of the population. Most especially to what would become the most desirable demographic, the 18-24 years old. A gore fest, with some truly inventive kills, which separated this film from many of its predecessors, in that it actually invented new and unexpected ways to die. The series would later go on to dream up more diabolical, and in most cases, silly; ways to meet one's maker, but this film plays it pretty straight. A true shocker, one that has become quite cliché now, some 28 years later, but keep in mind this film was at the forefront of the movement. Pay this film homage, by appreciating the inventiveness, and artistry of the execution (no pun intended) of the film. Some nifty kills, and taught sequences, filled with tension and terror. What horror films of today should be, not carbon copies of this film and the more generalized conventions of the slasher genre, but rather inventive, new, and willing to try new things and delve into new areas and dramatizations.",Friday the 13th

C'mon, this is the film that, along with ""Halloween,"" started the big horror craze back in the day! Granted, ""Halloween"" is much superior, but this little low budget film also made major waves when it was released in 1980. Costing just $750,000 and grossing over $40 million, this film had one huge thing going for it: Betsy Palmer! A former 50's glamour girl, who starred on Broadway, films and TV, Betsy stripped down the glamour and made a fantastic psycho in this film. SPOILERS:(But hasn't everyone seen this?) Speaking outloud to herself in a schizo baby voice and answering in her own gravely voice(""Kill her mommy...I will Jason""), Ms. Palmer shocked audiences as Pamela Vorhees, Jason's mother. Though the film would spawn countless sequels featuring her psycho son, Jason, I always remember back how the franchise first started. Too bad Palmer's character was be-headed..She could have shown up at some point during the series, and sent some more shivers down people's spines! I, for one, was very disappointed a different actress played Pamela Vorhees in dream sequences, in last year's ""Freddy Vs. Jason."" Nobody can replace Betsy as Pamela! The film also features a young unknown, Kevin Bacon,and also featured creative shocking(for it's time) murder sequences. For many years, the original uncut version of this film has been released on DVD in every country except the United States by Warner Bros.(Paramount never foresaw this being such a huge film, and let Warner Brothers own the foreign rights to the original film, but not the sequels). Paramount STILL has never released the uncut version in the United States, sadly. Let's hope one day that will change.",Friday the 13th

(I like to consider it the beginning of horror/slasher of the 80's, though I'm sure it's really not.) It's based on a vengeful killing spree of a killer that has some connection to the area in which they stalk that involves a terrible accident years before. If you've never seen it, go get it.

320,Wwmbrd,The Slasher Cash-in-er,4,20 September 2021,"The movie that started it all. If all was ""Jason Voorhees"", that is. Described by the director Sean Cunningham as a cash in on the sudden popularity of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" slasher, Friday the 13th lives on as a cult classic. With its ""Goosebumps"" level of horror, a little blood, and some shaky camera work, apparently the audiences of 1980 were a lot more easily invoked to dread and terror- as the early 80s were a huge renaissance for the horror genre with films like The Shining, The Thing, Poltergeist, and Nightmare On Elm Street coming out all within three short years. However, what those movies did with acting, direction, and effects, Friday the 13th is low budget schlock by comparison.Perhaps Friday the 13th codified the horror genre's stupid, sex crazed, teen protagonists-who-for-no-good-reason-find-reasons-to-go-off-by-themselves, but a welcome introduction to filmmaking, it is not. Convenience is excusable in some cases, but when literally every character does the complete opposite of what makes sense and ventures off on their own into the dark, I found myself watching with dark, if a bit disinterested enthusiasm, that they had what was coming to them for being so idiotic. The movie is entirely overreliant on shock value and jump scares to the point when each character manufactures a reason to walk out, their demise is following as close behind as their shadow.It's a simple movie, and I suppose its place in history makes it worth watching once, but it's absolutely not anything I would want to revisit on a yearly basis.",Friday the 13th
321,matthewnoorman,"Good, not great. Creepy, but not scary",7,20 September 2019,"Given it might have been scarier back then than it is now (like most old horror films) but the differences between this and other slashers like halloween, black christmas and a nightmare on elm street are obvious. Not showing the killer until the end is the directors way of taking from black Christmas the difference is Black Christmas had a build of suspense before each kill and each kill was scary. By the time they showed the killer you were on the edge of your seat. And the imagery of the movies Above are more frightening, more memorable and better executed. A long with that the performances of this film are less convincing and muddy. Very little development of the plot let alone the characters. Part of the horror of those foremention slashers, was they built more of a connection to each of the people murdered.
Friday the 13th is good. It has a lot of flaws that people like to overlook but is still a solid movie a good to own if you are a horror fan. But there's not much original here and it's simply not as frightening as the other films coming out at that time.",Friday the 13th
322,Chris-332,"Surprisingly, a great slasher movie.",7,10 August 1999,"I think it's safe to say that the Friday the 13th series is a very, very terrible franchise. Jason is a cool killer, but there are just WAY too many movies that are exactly the same. Although every single Friday the 13th sequel is horrible (except for maybe the second one), the original movie is amazing. It has the best death scenes of any slasher movie. That spear through the bed was a masterpiece in slasher art. Mrs. Voorhees was so much better than Jason himself. Her motive was classic. And it's so cool how (if you have never heard anything about the movie at all) you don't know that it's her. Jason could never beat those marvelous killings by his lunatic mother. And the killings have GREAT special effects. Every Friday sequel combined couldn't compare to how real the killings were. Another great thing about this movie is that the story is pretty decent. It doesn't have a lot of scenes where you know what was going to happen. And the acting was much better than the Jennifer Love Hewitt/Neve Campbell movies nowadays. The only things that I don't like about the movie are the fact that it's a total rip off of Halloween and how Mrs. Voorhees dies. But if you forget about those two things, the movie is a very impressive movie for one that has almost TEN sequels that suck. The way I would've done the series is like this: The first one exactly how it was, only not having it the way Jason's mom die the way she did, but a more believable death which would be realistic for her to still live. The second one would be pretty much the way it was, except having Jason find the mask in that movie, not the next, and not having the scene where the girl dresses up as Mrs. Voorhees and tricking Jason. And the third and final one would have Jason's mom come back so both her AND Jason do a killing spree together which would have Jason decapitated and his mom burned to ashes.",Friday the 13th
323,chez-3,Box office smash - What's all the fuss?,4,28 January 1999,"When ""Friday the 13th"" was released in the early summer of 1980 it was a box office smash! Now, almost 19 years later, one must ask what all the fuss was about?A horror film can be stylishly made with plenty of scares thrown in with some gruesomeness (take ""Halloween"" which has no real on screen violence after the first scene.) FT13th goes for the sickening gore from scene one which kills any suspense the film might have. We know these kids are going to be hunted down and we know they're going to die in some brutal fashion.Perhaps if the film had contained a few more scares we could have forgiven the violence. But the only real scare is the infamous canoe shot at the end and even that ripped off ""Carrie.""As far as the acting goes - forget it! This is some of the worst actors in the world. (Yes, I know Kevin Bacon is in it. Judging from this film you'd have to bet you couldn't predict the stardom he has achieved). Look at the last scene Adrienne King has in the hospital telling the police about the boy. The only thing I felt was the urge to laugh at how wooden she was.Still, this is probably the best in the series, though I did like the 3-D effects in the third film. But if you're a horror lover and want good (not cheap) scares, ""Friday the 13th"" is one to steer clear from.",Friday the 13th

326,helencmm,The godmother of all the 80s slashers (Halloween is the mother).,6,22 August 2019,"If someone wants to watch a slasher film, I think that this one should be the one of the first choices, since it became influence to the later ones of the same genre.I think that it's the best way, because if you start to watch the newest ones, or even the remakes, then you will find this one very cliché and predictable, while the exact opposite happens.First of all, it's not cliché. Actually, for this period standards it's very innovative. It came out in 1980. That's about 39 years ago. I know that the presentation of 1980s horror with the 2000s-present differs a lot.I liked its authentic plot. The horror aura that oozes is really special. Different than the todays one, that they just want to scary you with one-after-another jumpscares. It really builds tension.The gore I think is mediocre. For the then standards maybe was very gory, but for the todays one it's very minimal. Tom Savini did a great job.I'm going to be realistic. I've watched many similar themed films before watching this one and that's why I found this one such a cliché, but as I've told above it is not. I kinda knew what was going to happen and how the final girl would find the bodies etc.Another thing I want to mention is that i didnt liked the protagonist (a.k.a. final girl). I didn't liked the acting skills of the actress. She was really really annoying.By the way her screams were obviously so fake. Nothing realistic.It's a classic and very popular film. Many people know the story and the ending without even been watched the film. I was one of them. Of course I didn't knew details, but some general important parts.Generally, I enjoyed this film, and I recommend it, because I think that we sould watch the evolution of this subgenre (slasher). Especially a real horror fan. I can say for sure that the next three ones are way better than this one. They contain more action and we learn more things about the story, so in my opinion, you should continue watching this franchise.",Friday the 13th

331,Duzniak38,A Date to Remember,10,2 August 2006,"Friday the 13th. The movie which turned around the horror genre and gave us one of the most unforgettable villains and endings, is, and always will be a horror classic. Friday the 13th doesn't set out to be glossy and glamorous. Friday the 13th sets out to do what it wants to do; and that is, make you sit on the edge of your seat, feel uncomfortable and unnerved, to make you frightened when you go to bed after watching it. Friday the 13th delivers all of the fantastic horror goods. The plot revolves around American teenagers, who are the new counsellors at the apparently jinxed Camp Crystal Lake. These naive, horny youngsters have a one-track mind and break all of the innocent borders which has more depth than you would think. Basically, the message is ""Don't have pre-marital sex, or you'll die"" just like many of Friday the 13th's predecessors and clones send out as well. Friday the 13th has a variety of characters, all who you could possibly relate to. These characters are then slowly followed and hacked off one by one, in dark, gory, claustrophobic manners, which may leave you frightened in the same way Psycho made showers scary. As the camp counsellors are knocked off one by one, the tension rises higher and higher. Along the journey of carnage, the hugely effective soundtrack really creeps under your skin, highlighting how jumpy and scary the events happening on screen really are. For example when a chase scene occurs, the music may speed up, the tempo rising and jittering, almost moving like the characters on screen are. The acting in Friday the 13th is not bad at all; some of the actors/actresses may be a little amateur, but there is nothing terrible in this picture. The settings are also very effective. The stalkings and slaying in broad daylight and open spaces are a twist in a new direction, showing that not everything has to happen in the dark, in a small isolated house on the top of a hill, so the variation of location makes forests, cabins and even lakes more unappealing to the viewers afterwards, and may leave them creeped out by the aforementioned places. The camera-work is also very effective. The way the camera 'stalks' the victim behind trees and bushes, and the way the camera chases after it's victims as the point of view of the villain is unique and exciting, and adds a more tense and faster chill to the movie. Friday the 13th may play as a clichéd slasher, a story of sex equalling carnage, but it plays so effectively well it is a too important horror movie to simply be dismissed. It collects everything appealing about the 80's horror genre and wraps it up neatly into this fantastic horror package. A classic in it's genre.",Friday the 13th

I will skip the synopsis since you've probably heard it all before or can read another review for a synopsis. My main focus is on what the film succeeds and fails in. The first film has a lot of pros my first point is the kills and special effects, as always Savini provides great effects and there are a few memorable deaths. The film also succeeds in atmosphere, right from the get go you get a great feel for the setting and suspense that builds as the story continues. There are also a few cons though. The acting for the most part is standard and sometimes lacking, mainly Pamela Voorhees is the real standout and gives it her all. The next thing is a lot of thd characters are undefined, not necessarily a bad thing it just felt really meh, in other films of this series characters are a lot more defined. Finally this film is about as standard as it gets. This movie brought the slasher genre into the public eye alongside Halloween, but in retrospect and after so many slashers and horror film releases from the 80s this one doesn't stand out as much and really only remains iconic for the series of films that followed it.

The story is so involved you really can connect to it and understand why it happens. The unseen killer is really what makes this film so thrilling, you never know what's going to happen. That's unfortunately what got lost in a lot of the future Friday the 13th films. Betsy Palmer is excellent as Mrs. Voorhees, they should have had her comeback in Freddy vs. Jason.

She adds depth to the character of Pamela Vorhees and she plays it straight which makes it very effective. She's a mother who is truly broken and angry about what happened to her kid.

Yes, the acting isn't golden, but it's still humans conveying somewhat emotions.

Sure it's not the worst I've ever seen because even the franchise has worse ones.You would think if a movie could get 12 or so sequels it would be good or sort of a classic but the movie truly should never get that status.It had bad fake looking effect, terrible acting, cheap scares that aren't scary and is simply a waste of anyone's time.

The critic side of me absolutely abhors this movie but the part of me that loves slasher films adores this film. It's such easy fodder to tear into but it's also entertaining despite all the flaws. Bad acting? Check. Bad camera work? Check. Spending four fifths of the movie thinking the camera man is the killer? Check.It's got some decent gore here and there and, unlike Halloween (a movie both sides of me abhors) it actually gets to the killing and doesn't ""build suspense"" to get to a pointless ending. This movie moves along fast enough to keep you interested and, despite tons of filler, is so much fun to watch because it's so easy to sit with friends and riff it.Thus, it's a pretty great horror film and party movie in my opinion.",Friday the 13th

""Friday the 13th"" was just another slasher film at that time, but now, it's probably one of the most famous and notorious slasher films in the history of American Cinema. Thanks, Sean Cunningham!

348,HorrorFreak1997,classic slasher film that set the standard for the sub genre at the time,7,10 September 2016,"Friday the 13th is a film of great notoriety. everybody and their entire bloodline have heard if not seen at least one movie under the Friday the 13th name. there is a reason for this too. the first film is a great movie. Directed by Sean S. Cunningham in the year 1980 this movie set the standard for the sub genre and also spawned 10 sequels. what's most impressive about this film is what was accomplished on such a minuscule budget. made for an estimated 550,00$ this film shows that even with a tiny budget you can still make a totally memorable piece of cinema. with a cast made up of nobodies and a thin plot this movie still stands the test of time as a classic.one of the most memorable things about Friday the 13th (1980) is it's score and atmospheric setting. the two of these things help create a very dark and mysterious tone that sticks with the viewer long after it's over. we also get some excellent gore effects for the its time that still hold up to this day. the final showdown between the lead and the killer also has some genuine suspense and urgency to it that results in a brutal finale that will always be remembered. the final moments before the credits role are also very scare inducing and catch you off guard while also setting up a sequel. for its time this movie was revolutionary in the sense that it set in stone the tropes that would work for countless sequels and imitations throughout the years and would assist the horror genre in staying afloat. for this Friday the 13th (1980) will always be considered a classic.the acting in the film is alright. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's god awful. but it is not good in any way. the actors here are of course playing one dimensional teenagers. you can't exactly expect grade A performances.to conclude the review ill say that while not a perfect film, Friday the 13th is a classic in every sense of the word. it has amazing atmosphere, a memorable score, great special effects, some suspense and tension as well as a few scares. it basically created the 80's slasher craze and maintained it for years.the verdict: 7/10",Friday the 13th
349,very_doubtful,"Terrible acting, weak plot...I loved it! (!SPOILERS!)",8,20 March 2000,"If you want to see good acting, smart filmmaking and you're hoping for a story-driven movie, stay clear of this one!But if you're looking for a slasher movie, a classic in the horror genre, this is it! Horny teens getting cut to pieces, some of the finest death scenes ever and good suspense make this movie a must-see for any true horror fan (or anyone else interested in one or several of these points). The acting is pretty awful and the story has its holes (but hey, who cares?). The motive of Mrs. Voorhees is one of the best I have seen in horror films although Jason (coming up in Part 2) is more frightening as the killer. Camp Crystal Lake is a very eerie place and the atmosphere throughout the film is pretty scary too, thanks to the good directing of Sean Cunningham. The chase scene at the end of the film is a little ridiculous (Alice being attacked, knocking down Mrs. Voorhees, running away, being attacked again...) but Kevin Bacon being killed by an arrow through the neck and other great (and very gory!) scenes are worth a watch!The movie certainly is connected to ""Halloween"" (1978) but then again, the two movies have very little in common.My rating: 8/10 (Check out Part 2)",Friday the 13th

The latest film based on these characters is 'Freddy vs. Jason' from 2003, so this film is still hot and extremely popular together with another classic film; 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' from 1984. The plot is simple, but it works all the way and the manuscript is also OK. But there is two things with this film that I really dislike; the acting (Bad actors, very bad actors) and the directing (looks like a homemade video sometimes u have done yourself).

355,sunshinebeachcinema,A deadly excursion to Camp Crystal Lake,6,12 December 2013,"Friday the 13th was one of the first films to follow the formula laid out by Halloween (1978), and writer Victor Miller has admitted that he was 'inspired by' (read: piggybacking on the success of) the earlier picture. It's even got a title which bears little relevance to the plot beyond providing a suitably spooky date for events to take place. Surprisingly, this film would spawn the most sequels (eleven). It is the equal of Star Trek and second only to James Bond in the sheer number of cinematic releases for a single franchise.No prizes for guessing that a group of teenagers (including an early film appearance by Kevin Bacon) are stalked and picked off by an unseen adversary. Slightly unique is the setting: deep in the woods, ten miles from the nearest junction, let alone the nearest town, lies Camp Crystal Lake, site of a brutal double murder in the fifties. Some twenty years later, the curse rears its ugly head when a new generation of entrepreneurs decide to reopen the venue.Summer camp is a benchmark of American culture, bringing a level of isolation almost unfathomable for anyone who has spent their entire life less than six miles away from three major towns (that's me). It has long been the inspiration for ghost stories and campfire tales, but Friday the 13th helped cement the setting as a staple of backwoods horror.The otherwise forgettable Sean S. Cunningham directs, with little of John Carpenter's subtlety. Aside from involvement in later Friday the 13th films, Cunningham produced a number of other horror pictures, including the controversial Last House on the Left (1972) directed by Wes Craven (who would go on to make A Nightmare on Elm Street).Like Halloween, pacing is slow, highlighting the intensity of the murders by comparison, but Friday the 13th is slightly more boring than its predecessor. In other ways, Friday the 13th is more extreme – the body count is higher, and the deaths are more gruesome.Nobody dies off screen save the penultimate victim, and Kevin Bacon's demise stands out as particularly gory. Cunningham does make effective use of point of view throughout, forcing the audience to inhabit the voyeuristic killer, as they peer through leaves and branches.Also intriguing are times when victims greet the killer with recognition, letting their guard down before being murdered. A continuing exercise in misdirection, the choice is made to follow a decoy protagonist during the opening scenes. Her demise provides an effective shock, but also underlines how undeveloped the other characters are.An interpretation of these early slashers is that they are a criticism of hedonistic 70s and 80s youth, and their weakness for drink and drugs and particularly sex. Thus the various killers punish the teenagers, yet fail to defeat the more celibate final heroine.Psychologists have written more academic analyses of this than the overviews that I can offer, but in this vein, Friday the 13th is no different and the thematic ground trod in films like Halloween is more explicitly covered. The flashback murder is once again inspired by sex, and later murders are indeed post coital.Slasher film makers are rarely vocal about their true intentions in this regard, usually preferring to deny or remain ambiguous about their themes. But with franchises so long, and each film so subsidiary to its predecessors, it's easy to lose sight of what the original statements may have been.More practically, the less promiscuous could be argued to survive merely through virtue of not being distracted while a killer's on the rampage. At any rate, the juxtaposition of a sexual scene with a violent one provides effective mood whiplash, maintaining high emotion throughout the film.Apologies if I've already revealed that some characters die, but stop reading if you don't want the big twist spoilt. For while the enduring horror icon of the Friday the 13th franchise became the hockey masked machete wielding Jason, this first instalment features his mother, Mrs. Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) as the killer.Locked in a kind of reverse Psycho arrangement – although she was not responsible for Jason's death, she channels the spirit of her son through asides in his voice. It becomes clear what the chilling musical score was foreshadowing with its echoing vocal chorus: ""ki-ki-ki-ma-ma- ma""This film is thus unique amongst the genre for featuring a female murderer, with a general vendetta against camp counsellors, specifically those who would dare to tread upon the hallowed ground where she lost her son all those years ago. She believes Jason drowned whilst his counsellors were distracted having sex, and thus punishes the frivolous shirking of responsibility.It's ridiculous and over the top, and while there are some genuine jumps and scares that make Friday the 13th an entertaining thrill ride, and enough unique material to prevent it from becoming a simple Halloween clone, it ultimately falls slightly flatter than its spiritual predecessor.",Friday the 13th

The movies seem to have the same basic plot. The movie starts off as a bunch of teenagers congregate simultaneously somewhere remote to celebrate, and break off into couples. One by one, a mysterious person kills them in some odd or strange way. Often there's a throwaway character or two who's obviously labeled as a bad person and they get killed first or whatever.

Of course it's a classic everyone knows and everyone should watch, and yes it's cozy classic horror - Well worth a watch.The movie does fail in several aspects. Every person is killed off in pure stealth without anyone knowing that the others are dead until there's only one person left and the Killer suddenly is clumpsy and tries to kill the last person head on. Problem is that by then you don't care who the killer is since you see the person too late in the movie, and the motive just feels forced and thrown in there last minute. There's no Main Character, just a bunch of teenagers being killed one-by-one. The movie rips off both ""Halloween (1978)"" and ""Psycho (1960)"" way too obvious to go unnoticed, down to the opening scenes and personality of the killer.Sometimes less is more but Friday the 13th never lifts due to too little information. The last 30 minutes are the strongest but by then you don't really care about this random killer character showing up. And the ending, implying that Jason somehow supernaturally lives in a is also weird since the movie has no supernatural elements besides that.I do give it a rate of 7/10 since I think it's a classic and you get mostly what you want with the cozy feeling and slashing but there are sadly too much missing to be a complete movie for me.

365,Habibi-Universe,An Overrated Horror Cult Classic!,4,1 November 2020,"Sean S. Cunningham's 'Friday the 13th' (1980) is basically a teen horror film about a mysterious killer on the loose haunting a group of young camp counselors.This is one of the most overrated horror films of all time! To think that this is actually a good film, makes me go absolutely nuts!
'Friday the 13th' watches itself like a super cheesy '80s B-movie! As far as the quality of this film is concerned, it is in the same ballpark as movies like 'Jaws 3-D' (1983) and 'Alien 3' (1992)! Funny enough that I think that those two movies deserve a little more credit as I believe that they are a bit underrated!With 'Friday the 13th' we have a movie that struggles to tell multiple storylines all at once. When the movie starts off, we are introduced to a female character and think that this will be our main character from now on, however the film then changes the setting and introduces new characters. As the audience, you are confused why you then spend so much time with these other characters until you find out that the introduction for our first character was almost completely unnecessary! That could have been easily cut short!
If only that was the only problem with this film...
Like I've already just said, this film is not edited well
Furthermore the acting performances as well as the line deliveries from the actors range from mediocre to atrocious! I am usually quite forgiving when it comes to acting performances (if they sometime seem a little off), however in THIS FILM there was some seriously poor acting!Obviously with a mysterious killer on the loose, we need a killer reveal. Personally I liked the reveal, but I thought the killer's background and motivation was too shallow!Overall, 'Friday the 13th' is a completely overrated horror film, yet it is still watchable. I am sure you will get the best viewing experience if you watch this film with a bunch of friends ridiculing the whole situation and making fun of the film! I didn't hate this film (even thought it may have sounded that way), I just think that other horrror movies deserve more attention than the 'Friday the 13th' franchise! 4/10",Friday the 13th

If you are a movie fan and you hear those words, things like ""Halloween"", ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" and ""Friday the 13th"" come to mind.Out of all of those named and along with a few others have become cult favorites and made money at the box office for the most part. Since the beginning of films, the 'Movie Monster' has been an icon. Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolfman, every time you hear those words you think of the Universal versions of these famous characters. There are many many more. Our modern versions are just as colorful and scarier than those before. Freddy, Jason, Michael, Chucky, we know them all on a first name basis. Without even a last name, or even have seen any of the films in any series, you know who these characters are. Like Bugs Bunny and The Easter Bunny, they are part of our collective consciousness.In Friday the 13th we are introduced to the beginning of what will become ""Jason"". Though if you are looking for the 'Hockey Masked' villain, you won't see him here, at least in his usual get-up (not to spoil the film if you haven't seen it.) The first film in the series is full of a few surprises, and scares, but if you haven't been subjected to the plot already by someone else, or caught up quickly because you happen to be watching Friday the 13th Part 7 with your friends, you know what happens in this movie, and what it is about.What is it about? Pretty basic premise, without giving away the ending: In the late 1950's Camp Crystal Lake was closed due to the murder of two teenagers who worked there. 20 years later someone else plans to open up Camp Crystal Lake again, but of course this is a bad idea. Soon the teen's that have been hired to help fix the place and take care of the kids when they arrive, are brutally being axed off one by one.Pretty primitive and over used concept at this point in the 21st century, but in 1980 this was one of the more original slasher films to come about after ""Halloween"" had been a huge success 2 years before. Friday the 13th was an independent film like Halloween, then bought and released by Paramount, maybe that is half of it's charm and ability to rise just above the rest.Of course, oddly the first film is not the best film in the series, it gets a little worse before it gets better, but it's all good clean fun!",Friday the 13th

But this when first viewing has a intrigue place upon it separating it from the others. Cause remember this is before Jason got into the picture, so we don't know who the killer is and when we do it is when as first viewed remarkable.Camp Crystal Lake has been shut down for 20 years due to a vicious murder of two teen counselors. Now new counselors are about to re-open the camp site. Soon they will learn it was a bad mistake. And campsters start dying the horror begins, but not an enjoyable horror as many others before it except for HALLOWEEN, but a serious film with shocking death scenes thanks to gore master Tom Savini.What makes this film intelligent in the hint of scares is the intrigue of not knowing who the killer is or any clue of why he/she would do such evil acts. The he/she hides in the distance, not giving no clue to what's up in that sick head. The death scenes are so realistic looking it's disgusting. And the acting is great for what it is, especially by Adrienne King and Betsy Palmer, who is just a scene stealer from a brief appearance.

The ending jump scare did make me jump. The acting was dumb. The characters were some of the stupidest characters ever. There is one part where a girl is killed with an axe. Some of the characters even walk up to the killer. I know the killer probably had her weapon hidden but still walking into a dark house is not the smartest thing to do. She turns around to see an axe. So she just stands there and screams. The effects are good but not Tom Savini's best. The Kevin Bacon death was pretty impressive but other than that the other deaths were okay. So the movie sucked.,Friday the 13th
375,worthythorn24,Legendary,7,22 October 2005,"What can possibly be written about a movie that is 25 years old and helped to spawn an entire genre? It was 1980's film ""Friday the 13th"" that ushered in a new age of horror. Slasher films were nothing new, with John Carpenter's Halloween being released two years earlier, but Friday the 13th set the tone for violence and opened the door for several copycat films.The film begins in 1958 where two Crystal Lake camp counselors were ruthlessly slaughtered while making love inside a barn. These grizzly murders led to the camp being closed down for over twenty years and caused the community to assign the moniker of ""Camp Blood"" to the area. Now, someone has decided to re-open the campground and soon the memories twenty years removed become a harsh reality for the new camp counselors. One by one, these youngsters get murdered in extremely graphic fashion and it's up to the sole survivor to fend for herself when the killer is finally revealed. SFX master Tom Savini provided the gore effects and Sean Cunningham did a good job directing the film. In my opinion, the gritty look of the film made it look almost documentary style and it really added a lot to the movie. Another thing that makes this movie so good is the pacing. Unlike most of the sequels, the killer in this film stalks the victims and watches them long before disposing of them. Let's not forget the music and the ""ki-ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma-ma"".The only negative I can draw from this movie is the acting. Of course, with the small budget it had they couldn't exactly hire the upper echelon of Hollywood talent. Then again, none of them would have liked the script. Also, there was not a lot of character development. In a movie like this, people just go to see kids being murdered with any kind of garden tool/weapon available. I always wanted to see Jason kill somebody with a squeegee (Heck, he used a party favor in Part 6). I'll give this movie a 7/10. Definitely worth owning on DVD.",Friday the 13th
376,cny_cd,"Decent film, with a disappointing ending...",6,19 January 2010,"Yes, this is a classic film, and the first of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. And yes, there are many good scares and suspenseful moments, and until the very end the viewer has no idea who the murderer is. Unfortunately, once we find out who the murderer is, it kind of ruins the buildup. Are we really supposed to believe that a middle aged, medium sized woman can overpower and outrun numerous athletic teenagers (especially the boys), and men? That is the downfall of this film, and makes the film a bit silly. This situation is rectified in the next film, when her thought to be dead son Jason takes over the killing spree, but in this film the killer just isn't believable and isn't scary.....",Friday the 13th
377,troutman,Part 2 is better,7,12 February 1999,"Friday the 13th is quite a good slasher film though the first sequel is better.The film looks really cheap even by the standards of the day, but the location does give the impression that the camp is secluded. The acting like with all of the Friday movies is not very good but that's never been a problem with the Friday the 13th films.The film is quite scary and the gore doesn't get in the way of the plot (probably because there isn't one).Unlike the countless sequels that followed it was difficult to tell who would survive.The killer though not Jason was a bit hard to believe - a sort of old woman mixed with the strength of the Terminator.Michael Myers had his mask, Fred Krueger had his glove and Pam Voorhees has a dead cat on her head, I don't know which is creepier.Overall the original Friday the 13th is a really entertaining film that is a zillion times better than the film that is supposed to have ended the series - Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday, but not as good as Friday the 13th Part 2 or The Final Chapter.",Friday the 13th

This movie is very stupid, but it does things that weren't seen in movies before it.Most people say its a carbon copy of Halloween (which is a much better movie, but hey). It's not. The creepy camera angles and the use of the woods in the dark help to create an ominous atmosphere. We can relate to the characters. They are just normal pleasant, well meaning kids that get killed. As the killings start we wait to see which one gets it next etc.But there are 2 things that are great about this film. the music( which is truly creepy) and the killer's identity. this movie is a ""whodunnit"" (even if by now we all know who it was).The sequels tried to copy this but failed because there was no care with the film making. This movie is well made.The acting sucks (betsy palmer is an exception, Adrienne king was OK) all round. and the dialogue is dumb.

380,sumana-m21,"Boring, predictable and not an intense thriller.",4,21 February 2009,"This movie came out almost 30 years ago which makes me feel it does not have much of an effect on people watching the movie nowadays. In 1980 when it first came out it must have been a little better than avg release. But I got the feeling it was a little slow to begin with, characters did not really die very creepily, they were killed one by one, just being knocked out except the last one. But why? Why was Alice spared and given a chance to fight back unlike the others? Only to introduce the killer? That doesn't do much justice. I would rather have had more chasing screaming scenes which would have had me jumping out of my seat. And with the horrifying sounds effects in theaters these days, this movie did not the least bit creep me out. Some of the scenes had bodies being thrown through a window, a guy hanging backwards from something falling suddenly as Alice is running. lol I was laughing on that one. Like a dead guy knows when exactly to drop onto your face and make the audience scream. I just didn't feel it with this movie. I prefer the sequels to this one when Jason enters. He is surely more creepier with his mask. I give it a 4/10.",Friday the 13th
381,PeterKurten911,a weak movie that deserves respect as a godfather,5,12 February 2005,"I've seen the latest two installments in the Friday series and though they can't be considered as cinematic art, they entertained me enough to take a look at the original when it was broadcast. Having read many reviews on the original Friday the 13th i was able to acknowledge its strengths: the rubbed-based make-up by Tom ""Dawn"" Savini, the stalking camera movements (one year earlier than Hill Street Blues, which takes much credit for them) and of course the innovative killings. All of them have to be judged by the era in which the movie was made, because otherwise they don't elevate what is otherwise a dull movie. Tension is hard to find, a plot is obsolete. The characters stick in your mind as what they are: butcher meat. The identity of the killer is also more disappointing than surprising, but at least unusual. So what does a young man in the early 21st century has to thank this low-budget cult film for? Its consequences. Ten more Jason movies and a whole slasher genre from which to pick the best. That's why it gets a score over 3 Still, i think it's a shame this movie has aged so rapidly. There are other godfather movies who can stand for themselves decades later. This goes as far as the SF/android classic Metropolis ('26) and the silent Bram Stoker adaption Nosferatu ('22)...",Friday the 13th
382,kitfox30,Spoiler alert,6,21 October 2014,"For die-hard fans of the whole movie franchise I have to ask if anybody else noticed a major mistake? In this movie Mrs. Voorhees states that Jason is her only child, yet in the 9th movie, it is clarified that he had a sister. How did that happen? I cannot see how I could be the only one that seem to catch that. The movie as a whole is good, Tom Savinis makeup is brilliant (as always), and the story itself is good, but I can think of a couple of people who in 1980 would have made better casting choices than Betsy Palmer and Adrienne King. They seemed like they were trying to hard for roles that were not what they wanted to do. Nowadays someone who looks like A.K. would not be cast. She's supposed to be about 18 and she looks like she's 25.But this is not the only movie that cast much older people in younger roles. Remember GREASE?",Friday the 13th

The acting sucked, the dialouge was lame Example: ""If you were a flavor of ice cream, what flavor would you be""? The second half was a completely different story, only because the murders kick in with (SPOILER) Kevin Bacon's throat getting pierced and his girlfriend's head getting axed.

385,Devil_Boy_80,A True Classic,10,4 July 2005,"The Best Friday The 13th movie i have ever seen but my personal favorite is Friday The 13th Part VI Jason Lives, The Plot is Simple On Friday, June 13th of 1958, two Camp Crystal Lake counselors, Claudette and Barry, slip away from the campfire for an illicit rendezvous. They are discovered and murdered by an unseen assailant.Two decades later, the camp is preparing to reopen. The town loony, Crazy Ralph, warns camp cook Annie that ""Camp Blood"" has a death curse, but Annie continues to hitch her way to camp. Local truck driver Enos tells her the camp lore: the murders in '58, a boy drowning in '57, the fires and bad water that thwarted attempts to reopen the camp. Annie then catches a ride with the wrong person, who chases her through the woods and slits her throat.At Camp Crystal Lake, Steve Christy is eager for his counselors Marcie, Jack, Ned, Brenda, Bill and Alice to begin their preparations to open the camp. After they get underway, Steve leaves for an urgent errand in town. The counselors work for a while longer, then break for some swimming. After a drowning scare, a snake in a cabin and visits from both the law and Crazy Ralph, Ned goes to investigate a noise in one of the cabins, and doesn't come out. . . A storm begins, and Marcie and Jack seek shelter in the same cabin, where they make love in a bunk bed. Meanwhile, Brenda, Bill and Alice amuse themselves with a rousing game of strip Monopoly. When Marcie leaves for the restroom, Ned's body, hidden on the top bunk, drips blood onto Jack's face. Jack is then stabbed through the neck with an arrow, and the killer leaves for the camp restroom. Marcie goes to investigate a sound in the showers and the killer splits her face open with a vicious Axe swing.The door blows open in the main cabin, interrupting Brenda, Bill and Alice's game. Brenda leaves to close the windows in her cabin. In town, Steve finishes his meal in the local diner and starts back for camp. From her cabin, Brenda hears a child crying in the woods and braves the storm. As she slogs through the driving the rain, the archery range is suddenly illuminated, with Brenda standing in front of the targets. . .Alice thinks she hears a scream, and she and Bill go to investigate. On Brenda's pillow they find a bloody Axe. The phones are out and the truck won't start, so they decide to go back to the main cabin to get out of the rain. In the meantime, Steve's Jeep has slid off the road. A passing police car gives him a ride part of the way, and he walks the rest - only to encounter the killer, who Steve recognizes before he is stabbed in the stomach.Back at camp the power goes out, and Bill goes to check the generator while Alice takes a nap. When she awakes she goes to look for Bill in the generator shed, but instead discovers his body mounted on the door, riddled with arrows. She returns to the main cabin and seals herself in, only to have Brenda's corpse thrown through the window. She flees, and runs into Pamela Voorhees, an ""old friend of the Christys.""Alice is left alone against Pamela, whose son Jason drowned at Camp Crystal Lake in 1957. Now all the counselors of the camp must die, and it is one or the other in a match to the death. . . who will survive the long night at Camp Blood?A truly Great Horror Film if you haven't seen this then go out and buy it or rent it NOW!!!.",Friday the 13th
386,rick-98899,Saved by the ending..,6,23 May 2020,Hard to believe a movie with so many flaws spawned a 13 sequel dynasty. The ending and the peformance of Betsy Palmer saves it - making me watch #2,Friday the 13th
387,claptonisgod53,More of an iconic movie than a good movie.,6,8 July 2008,"Friday the 13th is a huge piece of American pop culture. It is the longest running American Horror series of all time, and still remains to be extremely popular. While some of the sequels were good and others terrible, it all started with Part 1. While Jason is commonly noted as the main villain in this never ending series of films, he isn't the killer in Part 1. It is in fact, his mother.Now I'm just going to come out and say that this film isn't by any means a great masterpiece. It is very lacking in the story department. Friday the 13th is completely void of any character development or story development. The movie is basically about a group of teens who wish to re-open a summer camp.. the catch is that the summer camp was closed because of some unsolved murders. The kids are at the camp, and there they are. The story doesn't move foreword anymore after that. The acting is also very terrible. Thanks to the terrible character development and acting, the viewer doesn't care for the characters in Friday the 13th at all. This is what brought down my rating.Where the films pros do take place, is the kill scenes. The kill scenes in Friday the 13th are outstanding and creative. The kill scenes are very enjoyable and fun to watch, but are even better in the uncut version of the film, rather than the plain American Theatrical Version. The FX in Friday the 13th were done by Tom Savini, so therefore, you should know that the kills are going to be very good. If you plan on watching Friday the 13th for any other reason than cool death scenes, then you shouldn't watch it. It's what the movie is good for.The film does have other pros, though. The camp feel is extremely present in Friday the 13th. The forest setting puts off a really remote feel for the film, which improves the fear. The thing that makes Friday the 13th so good is the small details and cinematography. You can hear birds chirping in the background, you can hear crickets singing, you can hear leaves crack. These make the film seem so much more real, and therefore enjoyable. Friday the 13th is best when viewed in small groups with the lights off, preferably with a bag of popcorn in hand.Friday the 13th also has a very good surprise ending. It blew me away after I seen it.Friday the 13th also truly kick started the slasher genre. While the concept was born with Psycho (1960), Friday the 13th set the tone and the feel. While it didn't do this all by itself (Bay of Blood, Black Christmas, and Halloween played big roles as well) it is still cool to see the complete beginning of the legendary genre.So while Friday the 13th may not be much to talk about when it comes to quality of movie, but it excels when it comes to being enjoyable. I mean, what's more fun than seeing Kevin Bacon getting an arrow shoved through his neck?",Friday the 13th
388,ernesto-garcia,A Genuine Review of Friday the 13th,4,28 January 2013,"Friday the 13th is a classic 80s slasher flick, but I don't see whats so classic about it. Friday the 13th is widely accepted as one of the best slasher films of the 80s and one of the best horror films of all time,and I think that makes me dislike just that much more.Friday the 13th is a tale about a mother seeking revenge for her son who drowned at a camp because the counselors were busy smoking pot and having sex. The film showcases bad writing uninteresting characters and a silly premise that I personally found hard to buy into.Some of the highlights include the deaths,particularly one involving a young Kevin Bacon.I can understand how people might think this is good,even great but just not for me.If you feel like I do stick with a far better slasher flick called The Burning 2/4",Friday the 13th
389,Krush_Burner,The Most Well-Known Date For Every Slasher Fan,7,15 July 2013,"Let me say this right from the start. I'm a big fan of ""Friday The 13th"" franchise as long as I remember myself. But I'm not the fan of the very first part of the whole series. The most obvious reason for that is an absence of Jason Voorhees here (OK, he's here, yes, but only for a couple of minutes). Second reason is more personal: this part wasn't my first, when I started to watch (first was part VII and VIII), so I already had a strong image of an Hockey Mask Guy in mind when I started to watch this one. As a result, I was quite disappointed. But, after all, this is not important. What is important is that ""Friday The 13th"" is a classic slasher from the Golden Age of such films (late 1970's - mid-1980's, roughly from ""Halloween"" to ""A Nightmare On Elm Street""). The classic plot structure of slasher movie is presented here in its pure form, including all basic elements: a group of youth (1) in an isolated location (2), having sex (3) and subsequently having a terrible death (4) - with only one exception. There's not much gore, it's more about atmosphere and setting than about blood, but it's quite enough for the first installment. And, of course, there's not much acting here, but - once again - what you get is enough for such kind of movie. So, if you're a slasher fan, it is strongly recommended to watch this one at least. Sure, you may watch all other parts, since they much better, bloody and creepy, but it's always useful to know where and how it all began. And the only film that could give you the right answer is the first one. Welcome to the Crystal Lake.",Friday the 13th

An obvious send off of Halloween, both Cunningham and Miller do enough to separate from Carpenter's classic. Cunningham does a great job as director giving intense killer P.O.V shots while Manfredini's catchy and eerie score is effective with Cunningham's decision to play it only when the killer is on the prowl. Tom Savini gives some of the best special effects the 80s has to offer, and the film has many memorable death scenes including a young Kevin Bacon getting speared in the throat. Young cast of camp counselors led by female lead Adrienne King are charming and work well together. Film holds up well today, giving a newer audience a surprise reveal that Jason, who's presence goes hand-in-hand with this series, isn't the film's killer. Movie introduces one of my favorite horror character; not Jason, but Crazy Ralph who is hilariously and perfectly portrayed by Walt Gorney.",Friday the 13th

Despite warnings of a dark past and a 'death curse', the teens decide to have a good time anyway, and at night indulge in sex, drugs, and strip poker. Unfortunately for them, a psycho killer is prowling the camp grounds, picking them off one by one. When only one is left, she must discover the identity of the killer and fight for her life.my thoughts: Ever since I can remember, I've loved this film. When I was a child, it scared the crap out of me. That chilling noise playing in the stalk sequences (which has now become the most famous sound in horror films) haunted my nightmares, and some of the gore scenes were really graphic.Viewing it now, it is no longer that scary but it is still a lot of fun. I liked how these earlier Friday films ignored the stereotypical teenage characters. There's no slut, no jock, no token anything. Every character felt really natural and for some of them, I cared when they died.The gore scenes are great, thanks to Tom Savini. We get stabbings, decapitations, and plenty more. Gore hounds will love this. Well since every gore hound has seen this, gore hounds mostly already love this.And then there's the two key things in making a good horror film. The directing and the music. Sean S. Cunningham is a really good director and establishes the camp setting perfectly. He adds beautiful shots of the wind blowing against the trees, the lake at sunrise, that you wouldn't find in later entries.The music is also great. Harry Manfredini is one of my favorite composers, because he makes the chase scenes so much more exciting. The music in the final scene also works like a charm.I forgot to mention that this film has one of the most popular and remembered horror endings of all time. And while it may have stolen from CARRIE, it works just as well here and is the cherry on top of a classic slasher film.",Friday the 13th

They are: the opening title, where the words `Friday the 13th' shatter glass; Kevin Bacon and the arrowhead; and Jason attacking the girl in the boat.  Those three moments are cool.  The rest of the film is boring, and the horror violence is hilarious.  The shadow of the axe being raised and then the girl screaming with the axe in her forehead are simply wonderfully bad.

The have seen most of the other (for the most part) god-awful ""Friday"" movies, and have to say, this one outshines all of them. Firstly, the women in this episode are hands-down the most beautiful in any of the sequels.  Secondly, there were quite a few scares, that depending on the atmosphere, could have you jumping out of your seat.The gore and killing in this movie are second to none, and very realistic. The movie may be worth watching to see Kevin Bacon take an arrow the the throat alone.  (Then again, if I got a chance to make love to the girls he did in the movie, I might have been willing to accept a similar fate).  I normally have a reasonably strong stomach, but there were times I had to turn away briefly (which I say is a testament to the realistic effects, not my cowardice).I don't know why everyone rips the acting in these movies.  It seems equivalent to pretty much 80% of the movies from that era.  Of course, this is not an oscar winner, but the cast is for the most part, teenagers. Adrienne King, who plays the part of the cliched last surviving heroine, did a respectable job.  So did Betsy Palmer who played Mrs. Voorhees.  Also, the low budget that this movie had added to the appeal, giving a grainy, atmospheric, and more raw feel to the movie, then the slick and overproduced horror movies of today.If you like hard-bodied young women, great suspense, realistic effects, and great spooks give Friday the 13th a try.  If you're bored with the other crappy Friday sequels, Part 1 is definitely worth your time.Oh yeah, if your looking for the hockey-masked Jason, he's not here.  He makes only a brief appearance as a zombie in his boyish form.",Friday the 13th
394,The Film Buff,What's the big deal?,6,21 March 2001,"Now, I myself am a fan of the slasher genre, and this was one of the first 'slasher films' I saw. I have to admit that the first time I saw this I was pretty freaked out, but the more I watch it the more I realize that it's a really bad movie. The 'plot' deals with seven councellors planning to re-open Camp Crystal Lake. Years before a young boy named Jason had drowned there while the councellors weren't paying attention, and ever since there have been some strange going-ons in the woods. Well it starts off with two teens necking in a cabin. One gets a knife in his stomach and the other one is killed off screen. Then we are introduced to the main fodder. Well, as if you wouldn't guess, the teens aren't worried about fixing up the camp. No, instead there interested in playing 'strip Monopoly' and playing a game of hanky-panky. But, as if you wouldn't have known, they begin getting killed off by a mysterious assailant. One girl gets her throat cut, another gets an axe  in her head, etc. Well, this goes on until finally the killer is revealed. And the killer is -- Well I won't tell you, that would give away the fun! So anyway, FRIDAY THE 13th is a classic and all, but it is no way near films like HALLOWEEN or JUST BEFORE DAWN. It's not even the best in the series. But, since this movie's really popular and all, you're no slasher fan if you haven't seen this, so go rent it now just to laugh at  the stilted acting and to cringe at the gory deaths!GORE: 9/10 ACTING: 5/10 DIRECTION: 4/10 SUSPENSE: 5/10",Friday the 13th
395,The Film Buff,"Enjoyable, but not the best in it's series",6,11 November 2001,"FRIDAY THE 13th was not the first slasher movie ever made. However, it was the film that started the whole slasher craze of the early-80's. And while HALLOWEEN and BLACK CHRISTMAS (the first true slashers) were classy and more in the vein of Hitchcock, FRIDAY THE 13th is pure exploitation.
(Warning: contains MAJOR spoilers!)Annie, a young teenage girl, is hitchhiking across the backwoods of New Jersey. Her destination: Camp Crystal Lake, where she will work as a camp chef. She arrives in a sleepy little town on the edge of the lake where, shortly after, the local diner patrons warn her of the curse of ""Camp Blood."" She is then given a scare when the local town crazy, Ralph, jumps at her screaming the likes of ""You're all d-o-o-o-med!"" and ""Camp Blood - it's got a death curse."" As if that wasn't bad enough, a greasy truck driver who Annie has hitched a ride with tells her of the legend of the cursed summer camp. Supposedly a young boy named Jason Vorhees drowned there in the 50's. Ever since then, whenever the camp has been set to re-open, strange things have happened: fires, water contamination and . . . murder. The truck driver just knows that something terrible is going to happen again but, naturally, the rather unsettling premonition falls on deaf ears. Annie is dropped off by a graveyard and hitches a ride with another, this time unseen, person. She soon realizes however that she is in danger and jumps out of the speeding vehicle, resulting in a chase through the woods between her and the knife-wielding maniac. Unfortunately, Annie makes a wrong turn and bumps right into the killer's path . . .Meanwhile, six other counselors have already arrived: Alice (sweet and sensitive), Bill (gruff, backwoods type), Jack (Kevin Bacon!), Marcie (Jack's sarcastic girlfriend), Ned (nerdy, plays constant practical jokes), and Brenda (likes to play strip Monopoly). They are under the supervision of head counselor Steve Christy. But when he leaves for the night, the teens begin to drop like flies . . .FRIDAY THE 13th is often considered a slasher masterpiece. Okay so it's gory, scary and even exciting. But it's no masterpiece. Heck, it's not even the best in it's series. It does however have a few strong points. Besides Tom Savini's incredibly gory effects, matched blow by blow by Harry Menfredini's hilariously tacky, but effective, score, there is also some true tension when first viewed. The last twenty minutes or so are pure cheese at it's strongest but it's suspenseful enough. There's also a great shock ending borrowed from CARRIE.It also has it's weak points. Sean Cunningham's direction is gritty and the cinematography is dark (make sure to get the DVD and NOT the VHS). The entire film feels very tacky and is in no way up there with such greats as BLACK CHRISTMAS or HALLOWEEN. The acting isn't that bad for a low budget movie, though. Performaces generally range from the good (Mark Nelson, Laurie Bartram, Jeannine Taylor) to the mediocre (Adrienne King, Robbie Morgan, Harry Crosby). All of this is capped off by Betsy Palmer's hilariously over-the-top portrayal of Jason's mother.So all in all a solid little slasher flick that deserves every bit of praise it's got. It's just not the best in it's series, that's all.*** (out of ****)",Friday the 13th
396,ben_mister_s,A lucky day for fans of horror!!!,9,3 October 2008,"This movie is the mother of all slasher movies. I remember that I watched this movie for the first time when I was still living in the woods with my parents. I was finally old enough to watch it, and I turned it on during midnight, and wow!!! This movie scared the living s*** out of me.The movie is about a group of volunteers that go out to restore an abandoned camp named Camp Crystal Lake in rural New Yersey. The locals strongly disagree with them, but they ignore the warnings about CCL's dark past. It starts as fun and lovemaking, but when the night falls and it starts to storm, someone else is walking around in Camp Crystal Lake, looking for blood, lot's of it!! I'm not surprised that a lot of horror movies don't score very high. It's obvious that none of them are academy award material, but seriously, that's not the point. This movie is very creepy and fun to watch. I even got my mother to watch it during Halloween. As a fan of British costume drama's, even my mother thought it was a good horror movie. The point I'm trying to make: don't take it to serious. Just sit back, relax and enjoy this.8 out of 10, definitely",Friday the 13th

For the series as a whole, I think Part 6 is the scariest, and Part 4 is probably the best plot (if you can even think of a plot in these films).  What these films are is pure entertainment--trying to scare someone without too much blood and gore--in the first 4, at least. Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore--I seriously hope they don't remake it like they did Texas Chainsaw Massacre (although, the remake was better than the original).",Friday the 13th
399,robertlauter25,Definitiely not a Halloween Clone.,9,26 August 2018,"Critics like Roger Ebert lost bodily control of themselves in the process of hurling insults at this movie upon release. They called it a rip off of John Carpenter's Halloween. I didn't think so when I saw it in the early 80's and having just bought the box set, guess what... I still don't. Aside from teenagers getting killed, there is literally no common denominator between the two. And by that standard, Halloween itself was a clone of the Texas Chainsaw massacre. The meteoric rise of this franchise reminds me of the Trump election, the more self entitled snobs mocked it, the better it did. The producers and studio got so sick of it, that they just said the hell with it and used it as a springboard to actually clone Halloween with the many sequels, a handful of which were good too. Aside from great cinemaphotography and Mafredini's creative score, the young actors gave stellar performances, especially given the limited subject matter. I fail to this day to see, how the teenagers in Halloween were anymore likeable or developed than the cast of this film. The atmosphere is way creepier than Halloween, the only edge Halloween has on Friday the 13th from my perspective was we knew the backstory from the beginning, where as Friday springs it on us at the end. Also the ending sequence of Halloween is better due to the music, where as Manferdini or Cunnigham for some reason elected to switch to ""happy music"" for the closing credits, instead of the creepy theme music, in any event, Friday the 13th is and never was a Halloween clone and stands on it's own as a classic, it's sequels, well that kind viewers as they said in Conan the Barbarian, is a different story.",Friday the 13th

I decided to see the movie and see for myself. I had already got into the Halloween films and decided to give the film a try. Friday the 13th for its time from the horror era was original and proved it was more then a horror film. The actimg while not perfect was better then a lot of B rated horror films from the remake era we get today. I liked how they shielded the killer's identity until the end of the film. Who was the killer. Was it one of the counslers? That was the main question during the film. In a way it was logical to believe that one of them was the possible killer. But instead it was Pamala Voorhess who we knew nothing about. But we soon learned her reasons for becoming a killer. Betsy Palmer played the character perfectly. She had a real cool calm approach and when you saw her you thought, there is no way she could be a convincing killer. But she proved people wrong. And add on the whole being Jason Voorhess with the whole, KILLER MOMMY,KILLER thing was just creepy. But I also liked the dark feel this movie had. And the creepy music which went well with the film. Overall I liked this film. And it did go onto become a cult classic amongst horror fans and that's no surprise. But it also spawned several films that fallowed. Sadly just like the Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street series, the Friday the 13th films started to go downhill. They went onto span several more films. I recommend this to any fan today stuck in the remake era of films who hasn't seen this film and wants to see what original horror is all about.",Friday the 13th

What an absolute treat as a horror fan!I've never watched this before because it quite dated but I'm so glad I did!I feel that because it's old, the acting, the sound and the lack of a true storyline would not have had the same effect if you were watching on low volume, at dusk and without the commitment it deserves.With volume the soundtrack truly is frightening. Much better than our current day horrors.It's not perfect this film. It has all the typical flaws of an 80's movie that just wouldn't work today.

403,AverxgeJoe,Hilarious but not necessarily in a good way,3,13 October 2015,"This movie was more comedy than horror. The acting was atrocious even for horror movie standards. It wasn't completely the actors and the actresses fault, because the script and dialogue were just laughable.The scene quite early on in the movie when the motorcycle cop came to the lake was just pure comic gold. It was so poorly done, written and acted yet so hilarious at the same time. Actually that's the case for many other scenes. They are so bad, but comically entertaining.The score was more annoying than scary, the high-pitched sounds in particular. Other horror movies also use high-pitched sounds, but this was the first time I was genuinely annoyed by it.The ending was far too prolonged and really dragged. They could have skipped many scenes from the ending and go straight for the finale at the shore. The way Alice finally killed the movie's bad guy, (erhm* I mean lady) was terrible and corny.However, I have to give the movie some credit. I was really surprised that Annie was the first to die. And she didn't even arrive at the camp yet. The whole time when she was running from the killer in the woods I just kept thinking to myself: ""Of course she will get away, there not gonna kill anyone this early into the movie.""

It's at times creepy and effective, but just as often, I found myself yawning because I understood that it was more about the body count than about any kind of reasonable plot.It's a lot like an Italian body count movie, but without the innovative death sequences.

Unfortunately, the murders continue now that they are re-opening it.This is one of the most famous of all slasher movies, put right up there with Psycho, Halloween and A Nightmare On Elm Street, and has been followed by nine sequels and a spin-off (Freddy Vs. Jason). Jason Vorhees (who actually is only in this one for the briefest of moments) became one of the slasher movie icons and seems to continually make money when one of his films opens. Why? I can answer that in four simple words: I have no idea.Director Sean S. Cunningham manages to milk just a little bit of atmosphere with his ultra-low budget and nightime locations, but not very much. The script (assuming there was one) must have been less than five pages, since most of the movie consists of characters walking around in the darkness for no reason. The movie is amateurish, for one thing, but that's not the main problem: the main problem is that it does the absolute worst thing a movie can do.It manages to be absolutely and utterly boring.There are no differences whatsoever between the various characters. I didn't even catch most of their names, and the ones I did catch I quickly forgot. The actors either a, do the best with the nothing they're given (Betsy Palmer, Kevin Bacon), or b, are as unconvincing as the day is long (pretty much everyone else).Additionally, absolutely nothing happens. It just goes on and on and on. It's just plain dull.On the other hand, it does get one thing right that almost every other horror movie in history has gotten wrong: the ending. The final 20 seconds of the film are genuinely great. They were amusing and creepy. In fact, the entire last two minutes or so worked pretty well.Palmer's very over-the-top performance is a little bit of fun to watch. Not a whole lot, but a little. Keven Bacon, in one of his first films, shows that he definitely already had both talent and skill and does the most any actor could have done with what he was given.And Tom Savini's makeup is very convincing. I'm not a fan of blood and gore, but those who are will find the few on screen murders to be satisfying and realistic. I assume. Considering the kind of fanbase this piece of garbage has.It still stinks pretty badly.This movie was made for about $700,000 and somehow managed to make $37 million at the box office. For some reason, teens flocked to see this. I can't imagine why. It's simply and utterly awful.",Friday the 13th
411,Kendich89,His name was Jason...,8,3 March 2013,"It's been a long time since the release of this horror flick that came out as a rather poor attempt to involve a whole new generation of cult- fans, but its name surprisingly remains a mark of a cultural reference. I must have been no more than eight years old when I watched this movie on TV. The impact was pretty strong for such a young viewer, so I just had to find it later and re-watch it as a maturer viewer. This movie was heavily influenced by John Carpenter's Halloween and it's not a surprise. What the movie makers wanted to do, was to recreate the same tension and plot-strategy, involving teenagers which goof and spoof their way to their inevitable doom. It's a standard approach of storytelling, involving a scenario that is predestined by its clichéd plot, but somehow we're not let down by the overall experience if we're not snobbish enough to not frown upon the premise it has for the viewer. Its attempt to engage you in its tale is like an old prankster friend, showing you around the forgotten places from the past and leading you up to the campfire for a late-night spooky story (at least that's the way I felt it) is awarded with success. If it doesn't deserve to be called a quality-movie, then it least has earned its status as an old and eerie urban legend that scared reckless teenagers for generations just by a simple catch-phrase ""His name was Jason...""",Friday the 13th

Friday 13th (1980)",9,3 December 2007,"Released alongside a series of slasher-movies during the late-seventies and early-eighties - including 'Halloween' and 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' - all of which were influenced by the original slasher movie, 'Psycho' (1960), this particular film has since increased in popularity and earned itself classic status amongst horror fans worldwide. It has spawned no less than ten sequels (if you include 'Freddy Vs Jason') and a TV series.~ Young Jason Vorhees was drowned in Crystal Lake way back in 1957. A subsequent fire and spate of murders resulted in the camp being shut down. Years later Steve Christy decides to reopen Camp Crystal Lake and hires a new group of councillors to have the place ready for the summer. Ignoring warnings from the local lunatic, they go ahead with the reopening regardless. Things seem to be going as planned until the killings begin again ~ 'Friday 13th' is based on the age-old superstition that a Friday falling on the 13th day of any month is considered to be a bad omen. Victor Miller (screenwriter) picked up on this idea and along with Sean S Cunningham (dir.) completed the independent slasher film in 1980. 'Friday the 13th' has since become the most popular franchise in the history of the horror film.The film offers teenagers indulging in sex, drugs and high jinx; an eerie setting comprising of rain-and wind-torn woods, the silent and still black lake; opposing cinematography - that of the gentle countryside come morning - and a 'whodunit' storyline that will keep you guessing until the finale. A neat twist - suggested by Tom Savini and supposedly stolen from 'Stephen King's 'Carrie' (Brian De Palma; Larry Cohen) - allows for a string of sequels that just keep coming.With great special effects (Tom Savini - 'Creepshow' & 'The Burning'), a chilling soundtrack (stringed instruments providing a frenetically-paced tempo similar to 'Psycho'), and skillfully executed directing (right up until the end, the murder scenes are shot from the killer's point-of-view) 'Friday the 13th' will make you think twice about your next camping trip.Stars Kevin Bacon and Betsy Palmer.Matt Lee-Williams, Review.",Friday the 13th

Kevin Bacon's death is by far the coolest and goriest moment of any rated R films in history!Another reason why this film is so dumb is that you can't see anything. 2/3 of the movie is filmed in complete darkness, making you really agitated.

421,leslie_rulz08,Friday The 13th (1979),5,1 May 2009,"From Sean S. Cunningham, the man behind the chase scene from A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984).In 1957, at Camp Crystal Lake, a young boy drowned. The next year, two of the counselors were murdered which lead to a fire. No one knows who done it. So the camp was closed.Now in 1979, the 13th of April, a naive local re-opens the camp along with 6 other teenage counselors. Throughout the day, they fix up the place & have fun. But at night they are all doomed when an unseen person starts to murder them one by one after they sin.This movie IS classic. It has inspired most of the horror films we watch today. It's also was one of the first slashers featuring teenagers having sex before they die in a rather grisly manner. But that doesn't mean this is a good movie. Does it?Well the storyline is...OK...but really simple. Yet the killer's motive just ruined the whole story. Kind of. Anyway, Friday The 13th (1979) is just another Halloween (1978) rip-off. So that is partly why i don't like it.The start of the film was swell, though the beginning ripped-off the beginning of Halloween (1978). Unlike Halloween (1978), this film was not suspenseful or creepy. Effective? Yes. But it takes more than effective death scenes to make a good slasher film. The direction IS NOT bad like other users have stated. The acting IS NOT bad like other users have stated. The score is really good. The atmosphere is raw like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). The script is not that good. I agree on that. Also, the villain is not scary like the masked villains from horror flicks before this such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), the underrated Alice Sweet Alice (1975, also known as Communion) or Halloween (1978). Maybe because the killer does NOT wear a mask...but still, the villain could have been better. Speaking of villains, the killer was an OLD LADY. The finale involving the confrontations between Mrs.Voorhees played by Betsy Palmer & the final girl, Alice played by Adrienne King were beyond me. She is an old woman! Just kick the beep out her! Instead, Jasons mother seems to be really strong and Alice seems to be really weak. Another thing frustrated me is that Alice never finishes her off. The stupid b#tch had all these chances yet threw them away. I was happy about her demise in Friday The 13th Part 2 (1981). The b!tch deserved it. There are more stupid things that this stupid girl committed throughout the flick which i couldn't be bothered mentioning. So if you compare this character to Laurie Strode from the Halloween series, of course Laurie Strode is more smart/likable. She was a good, smart girl in the middle of all the this terror whilst Alice was a stupid girly-girl who wouldn't escape from the murderer even when she had the chances.This picture does have an effective ending, i'll give it that. But the movie is just...bad. Zero story. Zero suspense. Zero characters to care for (encept for the 3rd victim Annie-what a shame she dies) Zero script. I could go oooonn & oooonn & oooonn but i won't.Friday The 13th could have been an OK if the stupid character Alice & the stupid finale didn't exist. Yet they DO exist.........well it is entertaining!At least the gore was good. Not good,-great! We get people getting stabbed, necks being cut & some more imaginative death scenes. But i warn you, the result in the gore department may not be as strong as todays standards so do not keep your expectations high. Anyway the movie is quite violent so...yeah. THE GORE IS GREAT!2 out of 5 stars.Followed by the superior sequel, Friday The 13th Part 2 (1981).",Friday the 13th
422,blakepatterson2000,Friday the 13th and Paramount Pictures in the 80's,8,3 March 2014,Excellent Movie about a woman who wants revenge on the managers of a camp. Camp Crystal Lake is Home to Jason Voorhees a Boy in drowned in the lake. Paramount Pictures Produced a awesome Horror classic for teens and up. This is a very old movie and still makes people jump at night. This Movie is the Best Friday the 13th and so is number 2. Although teenagers should watch it ALTHOUGH ITS NOT LIKE THE NEW ONE WHICH WAS TERRIBLE. Paramount pictures is not the same as it use to be in 1975- 1986. I recommend Friday the 13th Grease Ferris Summer rental meat balls up in smoke and others. I would like people to see these movies because you probably might like them.,Friday the 13th
423,papafain,A very good slasher movie,10,12 March 2005,"Friday the 13th is a very good slasher movie. Jason Voorhees drowns. His mother goes crazy and starts killing people to keep the camp closed. But why didn't Jason appear? Presumably because they were not thinking about sequels. There is no supernatural element in the movie although the sequels are full of it. This makes it a combination slasher/horror series even though they are not very scary. This is a well-paced film with a good mystery flavor, since we do not know who the killer is until the climax. The acting is mostly unconvincing (which is normal for this kind of movie)- not including Betsy Palmer. More old pros like her would make these movies better but almost all the characters have to be too young to be old pros. It doesn't help much in playing Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, either. Of all the movies in this series, this is the best, even without the presence of Jason.",Friday the 13th

The final girl just did some catfighting , runs to next house to hide from the killer instead of leaving the camp ? When a killer is actively trying to kill her she just stops by river & stays there as if forgot about killer... terrible acting too! Idk how a puny killer did the brutal killing !

425,Charlotte_Kaye,Gory set pieces enliven tired formula in classic slasher movie.,7,29 March 2007,"Anyone who grew up in the 80s watched this one and likely a lot of the sequels, too! They released one almost every single year after this, the original, raked in a ton of money at the box office. Critics across the globe were startled by its success since nearly all of them bashed it, and most shook their heads in disbelief when sequel after sequel were produced and were financially successful. For whatever reason, Americans couldn't get enough of these things and turned ""Friday the 13th"" into one of the most popular and longest running horror franchises in history. Looking at it now, it's a very nostalgic type of film for horror fans. There is something comforting (well, sort of) about taking a trip back to ""Camp Crystal Lake"" to watch a bunch of energetic, though mediocre, actors and actresses getting killed off one by one by a deranged maniac. There's no plot to get in the way of the slicing and dicing as a group of counselors show up to reopen a summer camp with a sordid history (a drowned boy and two unsolved murders happened there years before) and are killed off one by one by in grisly and effective scenes. Makeup effects artist Tom Savini did a pretty good job here, even though many of his kills were trimmed or removed altogether. After a slow build-up, there's also a nice pay off with a lot of action and jump scares at the finale; the very last scene being one of the all-time great jump-out-of-your-seat moments. There's also a now-classic score from Harry Manfredini, a memorable performance from Betsy Palmer as the strange Mrs. Voorhees and a young Kevin Bacon in a supporting role.",Friday the 13th

I only wished that Paramount wasn't the company to release these movies. Not that I like to see gore, but I don't believe in censorship, I'd like to see a creation just as the author/director intended it to be. With Paramount releasing parts 1-8, we will probably never see Directors' Cuts of these. I hope the Jason X turns out to be somewhat of a hit. The movie was overall pretty good. Introducing us to the 'story' with Jason Vorhees mother as the killer, I thought was a pretty good idea. A good start to the best horror movies of all time.",Friday the 13th

I had not seen this film since junior high, one of the first horror films I ever watched, and it was an odd experience revisiting it now with so many horror films now under the bridge. For one thing, the sex saturation level is extremely low. We get some counselors dry humping at the beginning, a tame game of strip monopoly and Kevin Bacon and his paramour under the cover of darkness with very little nudity. The teens in this one are not as annoying as later efforts, here just part of the blank generation. The lone female survivor reminding me of Alyson Hannigan, minus the playful eyes.

432,rortrain,A very suspenseful and atmospheric horror movie.,10,11 March 2012,"Friday the 13th is really a very good horror movie. It has an extremely good story about a mysterious place that is doomed with a very menacing presence that is unknown to us and that is why in that sense it is better than Halloween. I completely disagree when i hear people saying that ""Friday the 13th part 2"" is superior to its prequel. Because the most important aspect in a horror movie is the atmosphere created and the suspense. In the first movie, we are plunged in a mystery, an unknown menace is there but we do not know anything about it, we try to find out, it is mysterious, so more frightening because it is the unknown. They have created a place that is doomed and that generates a lot more tension and suspense. It is the major strength of the first movie. In Friday 2, we know everything, that it is jason from the start and we know why he is there and what he is going to do so it is a lot less effective suspense and tension that is created. The music of Harry Manfredini is a major force in Friday the 13th, it brings so much intensity and vigor to many scenes and the famous sound effect ""KI KI KI MA MA Ma"" brings so much more chills to the images. It is very original. The many more menacing situations because of the new story created not copied and the superior crystal lake blairstown locations are what makes Friday the 13th a unique and original film. Friday the 13th has often been cited has being a rip off to halloween, but that is so wrong because most importantly, this movie has come up with its own story, its own frightening and suspenseful atmosphere and its extremely unique and effective setting as Camp crystal lake and its surroundings. It is a true classic and deserves as much appreciation as halloween.",Friday the 13th
433,andrewbarry6336,"The first of many, but still under-rated.",9,22 November 2013,"I wasn't born in till 1990. So while I wasn't around in the late 70's and 80's to watch the slasher flicks coming out, my dad is a huge horror buff so he had all these, Halloween, Freddy, Chucky, and many more taped on VHS. At the age of four I was watching all these movies. Of all these characters only Chucky(my grandma bought me a doll that looked just like him)and Jason scared me. I never like Halloween even though that is what I watched first since my dad loved it. Halloween started it, Friday the 13th perfected it.This movie was made so Sean Cunningham could cash in on the slasher craze plain and simple. What he didn't count on was because of the way the movie was shot, and where it was shot that it would go on to become the number one grossing Horror Franchise of all time. That's right, this beats out other greats like Nightmare on Elm Street and Hannibal. That doesn't mean you should like this any better but I prefer Jason and this one over any other slasher.The reason is Cunningham kept the killer a mystery in this one and actually had POV shots with the killer chasing their victims. Unlike those others slashers the victims in this movie have no back story which is usually a drag but it works great here. He made the kills gory and great to watch even still to this day. If for some reason you haven't watched this movie then there is something wrong because the reason the whole series is possible is because of the formula in this movie. I will say you have probably seen at least one Jason movie and if that is the case then go into this with an open mind. The formula is the same but the set up is quite different and while it is extremely low budget it really works great.I do not knock anyone who likes Michael Myers or Freddy more. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Critics cant seem to understand how this series is so popular. I will tell you why. It simplifies the slasher and makes it more about the killer and unlike other killers both the killer from this movie and Jason in the others are both sympathetic to a point. Not to much but enough where you ROOT for them to win. While Michael Myers started the craze, Friday the 13th perfected it and made it fun to root for the bad guy. The kills are always great and inventive in each of the series. Even the worse Jason movie is fun(Jason Takes Manhattan, I am looking at you!) and watching this movie is a great ride that never gets old. It gets 4.5 outta 10 in my book and there is no reason not to watch this movie.",Friday the 13th

After this incident, the camp was closed for several years, until it was re-opened, just to become the center of the blood festival once again when Jason's mother returns to kill.""Friday the 13th"" may be a little cliché, it may not have the most likable characters, but it still delivers the basics of a good slasher film; blood, guts and screams. That's all you can ask from an entertaining slasher flick among many others. Also, a movie that keeps the audience entertained for about ten following sequels can't be bad.The sequels may be more entertaining than this one, but none of them has the classic suspense that we feel here. We won't be surprised when seeing someone getting an axe in the face or a knife in the throat, but in the middle of the murdering scenes we actually feel the killer stalking around us; the same feel that ""Halloween"" provided us.I strongly recommend this film to anyone who likes horror, maybe not strong and disturbing horror we see in many other movies (modern, classic, whatever), but an entertaining amount of people getting killed in a creative way.

The way friendship and human relationships are conveyed, even the sick way and the reasons why all the murders take place.Someone who's fan of the horror genre will spot connections to later and precedent horror / mystery movies.

A small group of camp councillors arrive to fix the place up before it opens however each one is murdered one by one by a mysterious killer.Taking inspiration from the horror classic Halloween, Friday the 13th follows the same basic premise, just not as well.Friday the 13th does have genuinely chilling moments that make you feel uneasy, especially if you are watching the movie alone, and good atmosphere as well as having a great setting, a camp in the woods, which has become a major cliché in the Slasher movie sub-genre, not to mention some great special effects done by Tom Savini.However, the movie does take a while to get going. I assume just to establish the setting and protagonists, however the protagonists are not that interesting as characters and are pretty two-dimensional. The only character I find interesting is the killer themselves (If you have not seen the movie, I would not dare spoil it for you). Usually, I'm not one to critique acting as I love over-the-top and hammy but maybe the acting in this is a little too hammy. Even the killer who I just said was a good character is somewhat less effective thanks to some bad acting.Overall, if you're a fan of horror movies especially slashers, Friday the 13th is a decent movie brought down only by a slow start and some hokey acting but chances are if you are a horror fan you have probably already seen it.",Friday the 13th

There are more suspense, the death scenes are more fun, the lake where the movie takes place is gorgeous and creepy at the same time.

441,fritz_fraugman,The Jason Voorhees Prequel,4,29 April 2009,"Between nodding off and my head dropping to the floor (j/j) I found this camp slasher popularly considered the best and the original of it's kind very dull. We have an opening set in 1958 with a bunch of teens timewarped from the future circa 1979/1980 (by their dress and hairstyles). Heck were boys and girls allowed to intermingle in summer camp back in the 50s I don't know. Two scuzzy looking examples take their leave after enjoying a campfire sing along to do alittle necking and more when a third interrupts them revealed by cam POV and precedes to slice em and dice em.Flashforward to the present, Camp Crystal Lake is reopening, viewers have gathered from the town looney Crazy Ralph that and a truck driver that Camp Blood (as the locals frankly deem it at every opportunity I guess they's gives a *beep* about recreational tourism and vacationers) has in fact a deathcurse a boy drowned there in 1957 and in 1958 two people were brutally murdered that set into motion the near indefinite shutting down of the camp til now.Steve Christy is leading this venture that will host about 50 kids and run by several counselors Alice, Bill, Jack, Marcie, Brenda, Ned, and Annie.The beginning and middle definitely drag with a couple of poorly deposited red herrings. Once the killings begin it is like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam consecutively a near omniscient killer strikes em down at every opportunity these cutout deserving victims are isolated from the others. I am not sure if I saw a cut edition but most of the killing is done offscreen the film only lets viewers see the immediate aftermath. Some great gore is provided by Tom Savini. Friday The 13th attempts an effort at suspense when the killing spree grinds to a halt while the last surviving man and woman try to figure out why they are so suddenly alone, power outages, floodlights on the archery grounds are being switched on and off. Of course they separate themselves and that spells disaster.No need to go further, every one knows the final twists in this film.BTW, the score sounds like a mixture of Herrmann's Psycho and Williams' Jaws.Quite a disappointment. Friday The 13th fails to generate any amount of tension and suspense because of laughably miss-timed music stings and poorly edited violence and non-sympathetic characters a real effort to sit through.",Friday the 13th

Its mass influence inspired nine sequels, a spin-off film (Freddy vs. Jason), a remake, a T.V. show, a comic book series, and other related merchandise. Despite everything that is tied into the franchise is awful, again, it's the impact that made it amazing as well as being a cornerstone in the horror genre. The plot twist at the end was one of the greatest of I've ever seen because, let's just say that, due seeing it for the first time only recently; had expected something different. I don't wish to spoil the movie for anyone, so please go rent it and keep in mind the horror genre is not COMPLETELY dead. Films like this, ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""Saw,"" ""Saw II,"" ""The Descent,"" ""Alien,"" etc. make me really appreciate the genre.

The creeping-around-in-the-woods scenes keep the viewer interested. When a thunderstorms brews up, it really adds to the eerie atmosphere. I love the part where Marcy tells her boyfriend (Bacon) about her ""bloody rain"" dream. A eerie touch to foretell what is to come. My only complaint is that some scenes are too dull, like when Alice is making coffee. But when the killer begins to stalk her, it gets interesting again. Alice really goes through hell. The climactic ending is classic and Savini really adds realism to the gore. The sequel was light on gore but heavy on suspense. I only recommend seeing the first four of this series (Savini returns for ""The Final chapter""). The later sequels are  more comical than scary (if not plain boring). If you're expecting to see Jason creeping around with a machette and goalie mask, you'll be disappointed. Jason is pretty young here.

445,Our_Feature_Presentation,Friday the 13th: My Favorite Day of the Year for a reason,7,17 January 2014,"The slasher genera is defined as ""a subgenre of horror film, and at times thriller, typically involving a mysterious psychopathic killer stalking and killing a sequence of victims usually in a graphically violent manner, often with a cutting tool such as a knife or axe."" The genera is best represented in the Friday the 13th series, so lets take a look at what most consider to be the best of the series, Part I. The movie is really clichéd but you do have to take into consideration that this was during the time the clichés where being made so technically they were new ideas. Also the acting is just downright horrible at some parts, however there were two actresses that did a pretty good job. The characters are really just there to die. Now that's all the negatives, the positives lie in the creativity of the kills and the dire suspense that the movie makes. The film's makeup and special effects were made by horror movie master Tom Savini, the effects are unbelievably realistic and really cool to look at. And the movie also generates tons of suspense because you know were the killer is but the characters don't, because of this your always held in great anticipation for the next person to die. The ending chase is good and the very very end had a good twist ending and good shock ending. So how is the original Friday the 13th? Its hard to rate this movie because it's just a dumb (not completely dumb however) slasher movie so the rating I'm giving this is really just on how much fun you can have with it and for that it gets an 8.6 out of 10.

People who like schlock tend to like the whole series, but horror elitists have a tendency to dislike them lump them into a single crap-heap.Unfair, I say! The first film is an excellent little thriller (better than most, in fact). Spare and naturalistic. Essentially a no-frills job that at no-time telegraphs any of the major shocks (the elderly lady as the killer, Jason leaping out of the lake at the end).It ingeniously places its young victims in a remote area, cut-off from any kind of help. This makes it much more realistic than something like Halloween (for God's sake, they're in the middle of a suburban neighborhood!!).It is also less derivative than Halloween, which is clearly a rip on Black Christmas. Some say Friday the 13th was inspired by Bava's ""Bay of Blood"", however I see Agatha Christie's ""And then there were None"" as the more logical ancestor.It also does a beautiful job of earning the tension it shows off in the last 20-25 minutes. In particular, the wire-taut unbroken shot of Adrienne King making coffee (her eyes like saucers) and pacing slowly around the cabin is marvelously effective.Mark my words, in 5-10 years the 1st Friday the 13th will be singled out from the rest as a mini horror work of art (at least a very influential one).",Friday the 13th

It has no lofty ambitions of being an emotional psychodrama that wins awards. It's a down and dirty exploitation flick and it's proud of it. Aesthetically, it might borrow aspects of films like Psycho and Halloween but it can only dream of being as polished and, dare I say, classy as those films. What Friday the 13th does offer is a gritty slasher flick with a bit more suspense than expected.A group of attractive young counselors have been hiring to clean up the cursed Camp Crystal Lake so that it can have its grand reopening. Before they get much work done, they start to get killed one by one and it becomes obvious that the camp's infamous death curse is real.It's bare bones Agatha Christie material with more blood and guts. It even takes place on an appropriately dark and stormy night, which does add a look of creepy and hokey atmosphere to the film that a lot of the subsequent clones never possessed.

450,hunter_a4,Classic?,5,3 January 2003,"Friday the 13th is one of those movies that should appear at the drive-in and never go any farther. It's the kind of movie people go to see just to get their girlfriend scared and make out with her later. And now it's on video. What a coincidence. In short, it's not scary; we never see the killer until the end of the movie, and until then it's weapons in the corner of the screen, or a first-person view.         The plot of the movie is better constructed than what I expected from a slasher, and that's a good thing, considering that it's sequels are just Jason running around slaughtering people for no reason, excpet that they're between the ages of 17 and 25. The movie begins with two camp councillors being killed by an unknown stalker at Camp Chrystal Lake in 1957. Fast forward to 1980, where a group of teens plan on re-opening the camp. Of course, someone is there watching them, but we don't know who. A bunch of people get killed, and the killer is finally revealed in the end, and the worst chase ever ensues. (I'm afraid I'm not going to spoil the rest for you, because it's a surprise, but a surprise you shouldn't bother finding out for yourself.) Aside from a good plot, Friday the 13th has nothing, not even Jason (That's right, big-bad Jason doesn't make his debut until Part Two). It's a movie that a lot of people see and that a lot of people liked, but maybe some day, we'll all come to our senses.",Friday the 13th

Now there are tons of movies that supposedly, no "" conveniently "" have the same location, a run down camp. And there is another "" convenient "" forest and or woods near or beside the camp.

(SP) Who ends up getting killed who did it? Well there are rumors around the town of a boy who drowned when he was 11 is the killer him? What I like about this movie the most is that you never see the killer till the end all you see is a sudden swipe of a knife or some other weapon and than your dead. I love the gore that is in the movie it was so awesome everything from the throat being slit open to the arrow through the chest of Kevin Bacon which this is his very first role in a movie that I know of. As you watch you'll notice that at the end of the movie there's only one character left Alice who is left alone in a cabin when you see a body go flying through a window. When I first saw that I was like. ""AHH S**T."" thats some pretty scary stuff for a kid who was only 8 when he saw it. Alice tries to baracade her front door than she sees a jeep pull up she comes out and out pops this nice looking old lady. Her name is Mrs Voorhees well after awhile we find out shes the mother of the drowned boy his name was Jason Voorhees she than reveals that her sons birthday was that night. I won't spoil everything but suffice to say there's a fight and a death than at the end of the movie you see a rotting corpse jump out of the lake is this Jason???",Friday the 13th

Friday the 13th is one of the first in the new breed of ""slasher"" flicks but, it's less gory than many that followed. I kind of grew up at the time these movies were being made so I probably have a bit of a nostalgic feel toward them.
 I'm used to the startling scares that these type movies produce but, if someone out there is startled easily, you might get a few scares from this movie. In closing I will say that while Friday the 13th is not one of the best horror films ever, it is a decent movie. And besides that, this is the film that introduced the world to one of the genres most fearsome villains, Jason Voorhees. For those reasons I give this movie a 6 out of 10!!",Friday the 13th
455,ethansanders-40501,"An average ""classic""",5,11 September 2016,"Of all the films to ever gain the reputation of a classic, Friday 13th, along with Top Gun, is the worst. That's not to say it's a bad movie it's just not worthy of its classic status, honestly if it weren't for the huge number of sequels I don't think this film would be as fondly remembered. The main flaws I have with this film are the characters and pacing. No one in this film is well acted or interesting, I don't mind simple characters but they still have to enjoyable to watch and here they're just not and as the film spends its first hour with them (this is a 1hr 30mins film) it really leaves me bored and disinterested. Most of their scenes feel more like filler and padding just to stretch out the films run time so it can qualify as feature length, hence my pacing issue. The kills are also a letdown as most of them happen of screen and are just throat slittings. The killers, Mrs Voorhees, motivation makes no sense as she wants to avenge her sons death yet the people she's targeting aren't responsible what so ever. The cop out ending is also annoying as it implies that one of the best scenes in the film was only a dream. However there are positives as well. Betty Palmer gives a fantastic performance as Mrs Voorhees as she manages to be both sympathetic and scary, it's fun seeing a Young Kevin Bacon and his death along with his girlfriends are really cool. The penultimate scene in which a zombie Jason jumps out a drags the main protagonist is excellent as there is good build up and payoff, it's one of the few jump scares in horror films that actually works. Overall, Friday 13th is a film with some very noticeable strengths how ever they are bogged down by too much filler and bland characters and plot holes.",Friday the 13th
456,Gigante,Cha Cha Cha....Ha Ha Ha.....,5,31 December 1999,Ok. So we have a killer. An eerie place in the middle of nowhere. A bad history of killings. Booze. Blood. And last but not least a group of horny teenagers with nothing more on their minds than getting each other's kits off.The first time I saw this I thought why did I just waste the last hour and half watching this rubbish. I had seen Halloween before this. I had seen a Nightmare on Elm Street. I'd seen Scream. So this was just scraping the barrel of trash. There was no atmosphere to it. I didn't feel scared at all. I knew what was coming (although after seeing about 19 horror films if you don't know what to expect then why bother). I knew who was going to get sliced next. A good aspect however is if you like gore.....maybe watch this.But when I watched it again I didn't think it was too bad. And the underlying motive for the killer is one of the best and most innovative in the history of horror films.Obviously made for a sequel it is a worthwhile watch but don't build your hopes up.

Sean Cunningham was probably looking to receive the same type of credit that John Carpenter got from Halloween by not using a lot of funds to produce it; nevertheless, it was produced by Paramount and was nominated for worse picture and worse supporting actress.

The movie is no where close to Halloween (1978) some of these people give it a 10/10 I'm like BRUH do people know how to rate/review movies those people who have it 10/10 the movie fails in various spots first of all where is JASON? You never really get to see him, none of the kills are good maybe only the kill at the end is ok at best, the acting is garbage during the middle of the movie, the whole thing with the lady at the end is stupid, the movie is boring for most of it nothing really intense there are good here and there but that's it another thing is the nudity is so stupid there's just people kissing like crazy for like god knows 5-10 minutes like what kinda slasher film is that those stupid scenes last for long at it takes interest out the movie 4/10 is my rating for the worst original slasher movie of all time",Friday the 13th

464,FatChino,Signposts to the future of slasher-genre ... still pretty poor,5,22 September 2005,"We all learn from the works of others ... better yet the mistakes of others ... we look to take the best pieces from others' attempts; incorporate them into our own; cast off anything we think was a fault and end up with a product that builds upon yet betters the foundations left for us by those gone before us. I guess if this were the case, well, films would just keep getting better and better and better ... damn it, reviews would too! Logically taking the perspective that, given the number of sequels 'Friday The 13th' has spawned, this particular slasher must have an awful lot going for it I decided to spend an hour or so watching it. You can see the various slasher trade-marks (as they must surely actually become some day) that the 'ironic' efforts of the 90s ('Scream' & co) would so readily taunt in a decade or so ... oh look there's the naughty-sexually-active-teens getting just what they deserve, there's the oh-teen-number-1's-dying-no-he's-not-he's-just-joking, there's the local madman who might just turn out to be talking some sense and oh of course couldn't forget the classic ... you think it's all over ... but it's not ... I mean it is ... or is it? etc etc.These were and are signposts through the slasher-genre; to be used again and again. Then in the 90s 'Scream' told us that was cool anymore; hell, it wasn't even scary anymore ... it was just too damn predictable. It was like the see-saw for that brief moment had reached a cynical, sarcastic equilibrium before being unbalanced again letting the old values creep back; this time more polished than ever.And therein lie the faults of this film for me. It's a clichéd story line; FINE ... It uses the same old same old (probably not so much at the time but anyway) tried and tested, jump and scare 'em tactics; FINE. But the execution (no pun intended) just isn't what I'd expect from what really is a mammoth of a franchise on number of sequels alone. There is a lacking of a sense of tension that has to be crucial at the centre of a film like this. Cheap scares aplenty, but no sense of foreboding. Sure, horror should be notable for its production values and its inventiveness (which are sadly lacking in bundles too) but low budget horror (as this was evidently) can offer us and often does offer us great scares that come from that sense of tension.Basically the story of the teens free to do what they want and thus falling victim to psychopathic who happens to be handy with various sharp objects has been polished up and done to death since. Without the high production values (see final fight with Jason's loving mother ... tisk tisk) and needed tension, this, for me served only to guide future tweaked versions of this for years to come before the 'ironic' 90s efforts 'showed us' how formulaic these (often enjoyable) films were, to set the process in motion again this time towards a more brutal, nasty end product that was evident in the 70s (see Wolf Creek, Haute Tension etc).Before viewing I had in my mind that this was for some reason on a par with Carpenter's 'Halloween' among horror fans ... really all I can say is that 'it musta been the sequels!!'",Friday the 13th
465,Theshapeo31,More Overrated than Nightmare On Elm Street but worse,5,14 August 2012,"Now where to begin? OK Sean S. Cunningham's Friday The 13th is called by many to be a horror classic yet I don't see it. When I was just starting to watch the series I thought Mrs. Voorhees was the one in the hockey mask and suit and what I thought was the original was Part III (don't judge me I didn't know) but when I saw the original I wasn't impressed with this film. I know this film is original I don't think people have seen a WOMAN in the role as the psychotic killer and a woman in her 60's at that original I will admit I don't think we've seen that before in a movie but Mrs. Voorhees doesn't work for me as the killer when I think of Friday The 13th it's only natural that I think of Jason since he is the series. This is actually one of my least favorite installments of this series, I'd out the list Friday The 13th Part II Friday The 13th Part III Friday The 13th Part VI: Jason Lives Friday The 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter Friday The 13th Part VII: The New Blood Freddy vs. Jason Friday The 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan Jason X Friday The 13th (2009) Friday The 13th Part V: A New Beginning Friday The 13th (1980) Jason Goes To Hell (The Final Friday)I really don't believe this is the horror classic it's hailed out to be, in my opinion the following film Friday The 13th Part II is the classic of the series: it has a better atmosphere, suspenseful moments, and great kills and JASON is the killer as it should be. Here with Mrs. Voorhees I'm just waiting for the movie to end so I can on to he next film.Anyway the story goes 2 camp counselors are killed, then a girl on her way to camp Crystal Lake, and she's killed, then other counselors (except for the lead girl Alice portrayed by Adrianne King) are killed one by one and when you see that Mrs. Voorhees is the killer you don't buy that an old woman in her 50's or 60's could've done all of this, so after a LONG boring chase Alice lops off Mrs. Voorhees's head and in the lake she's pulled under by a home decaying Jason and it turns out to be a dream. After this film I heard some gave away Betsy Palmer's (Mrs. Voorhees) address so people could hate her and tell her how bad the movie is, now despite how much I don't like this film I still find that uncalled for and think this should be a prequel and series starts with the next film. Also Adrienne King retired from acting after this film due to stalkers and one of them even broke into her home to get to her. Now my rating I give this mess **1/2 Out of *****",Friday the 13th
466,max-swindlehurst,"Bit of a let down, But I did like it.",7,19 August 2012,"This is it, the first teen slasher film of the 80's, that, following in 'Halloween's' footsteps, taught us to enjoy nothing more than watching wave after wave of pretty teenagers be brutally massacred. And nothing has changed, judging by the fact that the series has just celebrated its ELEVENTH entry, 'Freddy VS Jason'. Far from intelligent, intellectual, or even genuinely scary, 'Friday the 13th' differs greatly from that which it is supposedly influenced. Admitting that its sole aim was to make money, and describing the experience of watching the film as a roller-coaster ride, director Sean S Cunningham uses minimal characterisation and plot to construct a story based purely on graphic violence and scares induced by a sudden high pitched violin note. However, 'Friday...' still deals with the usual horror conventions, and is closer to a 'horror' movie than any of today's efforts, which rely on action, martial arts and even science fiction influences. There is the creepy setting of a disused summer camp, to which a group of young counsellors have arrived, intending to get it running again, the themes of the family - so prevalent in the slasher films of the late 70s and early 80s, and the anniversary of an accident, or prank gone wrong that occurred years ago, now coming back to punish those who were responsible. Despite being rather generic and often criticised for being overly nasty in its graphic portrayal of the murders of innocent youths, 'Friday the 13th' an d its sequels have such a undescribable, fun quality to them, it is impossible not to join in with the guessing who is going to die next, cheering on the surviving girl as she does battle with the killer, and jumping out of your seat every time the killer pops up from/sticks their arm through the nearest door or window. They are fun movies, and if the were an integral part of your childhood, it is definitely worth going back to see what all the fuss was about all that time ago. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a good horror but it wasn't up to the standards I espected. Espeicially with the budget they had...",Friday the 13th
467,mikejpg,The best is still yet to come...,6,26 June 2020,"Friday The 13th is a horror franchise classic! Everybody knows that!
But I don't believe it's this movie that earns it that title.
Let me start off by saying this movie is not a terrible movie, it definitely feels dated and the acting isn't the best and if the franchise never became a franchise then i believe this would of just been one of many 80's horrors (although saying that this movie did help kick off the 80's slasher craze)
It's not a movie you want to stick on every month but it is something you can enjoy for what it is.
As for the characters.. I do find it hard to remember their names but I don't think that's particularly important in a Friday The 13th movie.. except for our final girl Alice of course.And as for the killer... Pamela Voorhees is an amazing villain for what little screen time she has. If we try to pretend we don't know that she's going to be the killer, when we first see her she is actually so believable as the ""loving mother figure"" who wants to help Alice but then out of nowhere she just snaps into this deranged lunatic and I just love that!
She really makes up for the few boring parts that this movie goes through before we get to the final act.All in all I do enjoy this movie but I don't believe it's this movie that embodies the franchise that is Friday The 13th.. as the title says the best is yet to come.",Friday the 13th

The acting isn't that bad, the gory is done well, but the killer is where it falls short.Palmer is a classic and wonderful actress but there's something missing. I can't put my finger on it but there's definitely something missing. I also have to say I don't like how overhyped this film is. People always say Jason is the best in the original but where is he? It's like they've never seen the original.I have to praise the kills because they are original and done well. I also have to praise the score, definitely menacing.

469,HorrorFIlmReviews,Ted Munns Horror Film Reviews - Friday the 13th (1980),7,22 June 2011,"Growing up and being the first born, my parents were more strict with me than they are now with my siblings. I was never allowed to watch 15 or 18 rated films until I reached that age. One film that I always remember wanting to see was the Friday the 13th films. I would always run the horror section of the video shop and read the cover of the films. When I finally watched the first one it started a love affair with the genre. Plot:Years after the death of child and the death of the counselors who were being neglecting him at Camp Crystal Lake, a group of horny, weed smoking counselors move into the camp to make it presentable for its opening. However they are not alone and they are being stalked by and unseen assailant.Hot or Not:I love John Carpenters Halloween (1978) however it does annoy me when people compare Friday the 13th to it, calling it a rip off. Surely if anything Halloween ripped off Black Christmas (1974) and then Psycho (1960) before that, every film borrows from another. For one thing I believe the Friday the 13th Franchise is much more successful and entertaining than that of Halloween. What is great about this film is its surroundings and the isolation of the characters and director Sean Cunningham plays brilliantly with, his shots of the lake are very creepy. Something that critics never looked upon was how Cunningham demonstrated how the setting and tone in a horror film is just as important than the gore. Cunningham brought the audience into the film as if they were the ones being stalked along with the counselors.Of course the gore in the film is a lot more than Either Halloween or Black Christmas however it is impressive and the king of gore Tom Savini was at the helm. On top of all the positives that Friday the 13th has to offer it does have its drawbacks, I wouldn't say the tension is a high as some of the horror films out at the same time and it may not look as classy as some of the others, but it does have charm and that is what took me in. Birds and the Bees:There isn't much surprisingly, something the sequels made up for! However the ladies do get Kevin Bacon naked butt.Acting:Adrienne King's (Alice) is the week link in the film and I don't feel she was right for the part, she looked to old for the role and I never warmed to her. She appeared inexperience. Jeannine Taylor (Marcie) handled herself well and Kevin Bacon (Jack) showed some of the class that made him a star. His death had become iconic in the horror community. Walt Gorney (Crazy Ralph) was great as the crazy old man and he set up the film brilliantly at the opening. Betsy Palmer (Ms Voorhees) was great considering she wasn't a fan of horror.Bottom Line:Friday the 13th opened the door to the slasher genre and all true horror fans will appreciate this film. While maybe not the best horror film of all time it is fun gory and creepy. I would checkout the sequels too while all not to the standard of the original some come close and all have their individual charm. This film clearly stands out amongst other slasher movies.",Friday the 13th

But on the fateful day of Friday, June 13, 1980, the curse becomes true when Christy and his young, nubile teenage counselors are systematically murdered one by one until only one remains. When an elderly old woman, PAmela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) reveals herself as the mother of Jason, the boy who drowned and the killer, Alice (Adrienne King), the only counselor left alive battles Pamela in a life or death fight by the lake.

We've all seen slasher flicks before; it would be unnecessary to go over the things typically wrong with these types of movies. Nevertheless, it's definitely a horror movie worth watching, especially for fans of the genre. Its premise and presentation is reminiscent of the original Halloween (although it doesn't quite measure up to that classic), and it has strong points of its own. There is a plot twist that is certainly not mind-blowing, but interesting enough for this movie. Along with that, there are some fairly imaginative deaths, which is a bonus.

One of my friends wouldn't shut up about how bad it was. The last 20 minutes or so were very good, and redeemed a lot of the movie. If I didn't have friends with me I probably would have fell asleep and not seen the last 20 minutes. After writing this I wonder if I was being generous giving it a 5.5/10",Friday the 13th
475,lostanddelirious85,The start of the best '80s slasher series.,8,10 December 2010,"""Friday the 13th"" is one of those love it or hate it movies. On one side, you've got the people judging it based on its technical merits such as script, acting, etc. and on the other, you've got those who just appreciate it for what it is: a good, fun movie whose only purpose is to scare. And that it does.While not as technically accomplished as ""Halloween"", I find ""Friday the 13th"" to be the more entertaining film. The story is simple, but rather than being a bad thing, its lack of plot complications is oddly comforting. The story begins at Camp Crystal Lake in 1958, when two horny counselors are murdered by an unknown assailant. Flash forward to 1980, and a group of kids are all making their way to the infamous camp site to help the owner, Steve Christy, get the place in shape for re-opening. Almost from the start, we are warned of the terrible events to come in the form of the town crazy, Ralph, who ominously warns one of the characters that Camp Crystal Lake has a ""death curse."" Thankfully for us, the kids don't let all of the scary talk affect them, and soon enough we begin to see the old killer get back in action--dispatching of the apple-faced youngsters in a variety of creative ways.This movie was widely renowned for its creative murder sequences back in 1980--something which every film after it tried to copy shamelessly. As a result, some of the more bizarre murders might seem tame in comparison to what we've seen in the ensuing 30 years after its release. However, this doesn't take away from their entertainment value.What really works for this movie is the setting, which is so simple yet so classic. Every American ventures out into the wilderness to go camping at some point, and this movie is the equivalent of those camp fire ghost stories you tell to scare your friends. Every time I go camping now, I can't help but think of this film's prowler creeping around the woods outside my cabin and hearing that iconic ""ki ki ki ma ma ma"" sound in the back of my head. This movie did for outdoors trips what ""Jaws"" did for the beach.This film has rightfully carved out a niche in popular culture--the film equivalent of an urban legend told to scare future generations of kids out of their wits and make them think twice about wandering around camp alone in the dark.No, it's not award-winning material, but it doesn't have to be. Appreciate it for what it is, and you can't go wrong.",Friday the 13th
476,Chiidatbe,"Entertaining, but for the wrong reasons",5,26 November 2008,"As much as I'd love to give this film a lower rating, there was something about it I found rather compelling. In short, it's nothing special or different than any other horror film out there. A group of teenagers head to camp, the majority end up murdered, the remaining person finds the villain, fights with villain, villain gets killed. However, this was actually quite entertaining, but for the wrong reasons.Firstly, the negatives, Mrs. Voorhees has to be one of the worst scary villains ever in a film. I think this is down to both the writing by Victor Miller and the performance by Betsy Palmer as a whole. The ""mama"" scenes being particularly bad.The action sequences in the film were also quite bad with a lot of the scenes being hugely under-acted. After Alice beheads Voorhees, she almost calmly walks away from the decapitated head still lying on the floor. And one of the girls throws a box to try and keep somebody away at one point.I think keeping the first half of the movie mostly action free and getting to know the characters and seem them naturally worked well for the film though personally I don't think it really made me care for the character's death scenes as much as it should have done. But I do think a lot of the actual death scenes were quite memorable and well carried out.The ending I also thought carried a nice twist though I think the movie should have ended straight after Alice wakes in the hospital bed screaming and a lot of the dialogue used in that scene cut.Overall, a good film if you're looking to be entertained while killing some time, though I wouldn't recommend it as a must see.",Friday the 13th

478,PowerPadMan,Overrated snooze-fest,1,1 May 2004,"I simply cannot understand why everyone considers this movie ""A classic"", as it seems to fail in that category. This movie just shows that as long as you have some blood in a movie, it shall be deemed as a classic. Classic my ass. This movie is just another slasher, which would set up for more boring slasher flicks from this series, until ""Jason Goes to Hell"". This movie is about a camp known as ""Camp Crystal Lake"" that re-opens 23 years after the death of Jason Voorhees: who had drowned while the camp counselors were having sex. His Mother, who is aptly known as ""Mrs. Voorhees"", decides to seek revenge by killing every camp counselor who joins up in the return of the camp. What I don't understand, is why she decided to go after the new counselors, who had nothing to do with the counselors from when Jason passed away. I can see where they were trying to go, with her being some psychotic woman, but it just feels too sloppy. This film has some nice death sequences (I always feel queasy when I see a death via an axe.), including Kevin Bacon's death. This movie has an ""Iffy"" be-heading scene with Mrs. Voorhees head popping off. One positive spot is near the end; the out of nowhere scene where Jason pops out of the water to attack the final camper: Who survives.One thing that this movie lacks, is continuity. Most parts tend to drag on, and the only real time when the film gets interesting is when Mrs. Voorhees (Played excellently by Betsy Palmer.) finally shows up. Ignore this snooze-fest and check out the sequels instead.RATING: ** out of ****",Friday the 13th

480,Halloween1247,Very Memorable Movie,7,15 October 2015,"Friday the 13th was one of those 80's slasher films that were made in response to the success of John Carpenter's Halloween. What made this movie stand out (at the time) is this is one of the first horror movies to kick up the horror and nudity.This has created one of the biggest slasher movie franchises to date, but it all started here and it did not have Jason Voorhees as the killer. All though this movie started off as a rip-off of the Halloween but it seems to have at least tries to establish itself as its own movie and I think it does just that. This movie starts off in Camp Crystal lake in 1958 as a P.O.V of the killer hiding out in the main cabin in the camp. The killer murders two camp counsellors that have gone into the cabin to have sex. The film then skips to 1980 where the camps new owner Steve Christy is trying to reopen the camp after decades of trouble. Steve hires 7 new counsellors and they spend half the movie preparing the camp for the summer. Then an unknown killer shows up and starts killing people. This film features the usual slasher movie characters, but I find that these character are all pretty enjoyable to watch and none of them are too annoying. The main problem with this movies characters are that most of them are just forgettable. The main character in the film Alice (Adrienne King) is very clearly based on Laurie Strode from Halloween and has no notable personally quirks. The character that is worth mentioning is Mrs.Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) as she has one of the best slasher villain motivations of all time. Funny enough, when Betsy Palmer looked at the script for the movie she said it was a piece of crap but, when she saw that the amount of money she would be paid would be enough for a new car she accepted Sean Cunningham's offer to be in the film.Another character I feel should be mentioned is crazy Ralph. This guy is actually hilarious and might have started the ""crazy guy warns people away""cliché.The film is shot alright and taking inspiration from Jaws only plays the theme when the killer is present. I notice in this film that there is a lot of continuous shots of the characters and I find that this is a nice thing to see as most films you see nowadays is just cut cut. The far removed from society camp makes for a great place for a horror film and when the lights go out in the camp it gives a feeling of panic as it now feels dark and desolate. I felt that even if this movie did not got any sequels, that people would still remember this film and I think that it is a great addition to the slasher genre.Recommend to any horror movie fan 7/10",Friday the 13th
481,barrosjared,A Cult Classic With Some Issues,7,17 June 2017,"Friday the 13th needs little to no introduction, Jason Voorhees is one of the most iconic horror villains ever. It is even more hard to believe that Friday the 13th (1980), doesn't have Jason as the killer! The main villain is Besty Palmer (Jason's Mom). While she does pull off a great performance, Jason is much better.The editing in this film is choppy, every scene plays on for too long. The characters are indistinguishable from another, this makes it more comfortable to see them die. The kills by Tom Savini are amazing and executed perfectly, some don't even show on camera which is quite disappointing.

Afterwards we go to 1980, where some young peeps are going to try out for that same camp, apparently known as Camp Crystal Lake, or if I recall correctly also Camp Blood.In the evening, that turns to crap.

We all know the story of Jason in ""Friday the 13th"", well this is the original and therefore the beginning of a long franchise. This would would be considered a classic and a first of it's kind, but I don't think it is a must see. ""Friday the 13th"" does have it's popular scenes that everyone will remember, but that wasn't enough for me. The movie has a few (or in my case) one heart leaping moment, but ""Friday the 13th"" lacks too much for me to recommend. Frankly, I caught myself not paying attention to this movies quite often. The point is that the story is a classic, but the movie lacks the feeling of being on the edge of your seat.

""Friday the 13th"" was one of the very first (of millions) horror films I'd ever seen so I have a very sentimental attachment to it... but sentimentality aside, when re-watching again (and again) it still holds up really well as a really well crafted slasher with (for the time) some pretty decent special effects.   And why, oh why, did Betsy Palmer not receive an Oscar nomination for her brilliant work?   I tell ya... those Oscars - all politics.

But still managed to get a lot through.While the acting is hammy and overdone....it has to be!  That what these movies are known for.  You don't go to horror movies to see great acting, character development or plot.  You go to see the death sequences, cheesy one-liners, and half naked girls.  And that's it.

Too many of todays horror films rely on quick scares,lots of blood/gore, minimal plot line, and boderline acting or they go the extreme and become sick pieces of trash. Friday the 13th is of course about Camp Cyrtal Lake and how a couple of decades before a young boy allegedly drowned in the lake while the counselors were not paying attention. The film opens with a group of counselors attempting to re-open the camp however things slowly begin to go wrong and one by one people are getting killed. The last 10 minutes of this movie is pure suspense and again total pay off. All psycho killers should be taken care of like that. Parts 2 and 3 are also worth viewing especially when the uncut versions come out on DVD in early 2009 along with the uncut DVD version of part 1.

Of course, I stupidly watched Friday the 13th through my fingers and had nightmares for months.. I refused to watch horror films for years afterwards.A true genre masterpiece. The reason I say this is that you experience the film through the eyes of the killer, who is not revealed until the end. This differentiates the original Friday the 13th from other genre films like Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street. Both good movies, but Friday is different.

I wouldn't say that it's horrible but it's not very good either. There are some good moments; learning why and who the killer is, the spear coming up through Kevin Bacon's neck, and Jason coming up through the water at the end. But then, instead of ending it right there they continue and go to a hospital where the surviving character awakens so that we have to endure her terrible acting some more. Moments such as, where Alice and Mrs. Voorhees ""fight"" is unintentionally funny, as well as when Alice struggles to blockade the door of the cabin. This is one of those examples of movies where it's supposed to go without saying that this is a great addition to the horror film genre. But is it really? Would it really be such a great loss to be without the ""slasher film""? In hindsight I really don't think so. I never thought so much of this film and its series to ever go out and own and any of them to watch over and over again and to show people, yet these films are so popular and so talked about. Halloween came out 2 years before this and I guess spawned this series but it is so much better, even if it is considered a slasher film and spawned an equally horrible franchise. But one of the many differences between the two is that Halloween's director (John Carpenter, of course) was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock, where as Friday the 13th's director ( Sean S. Cunningham) was inspired by Herschell Gordon Lewis. Hopefully I won't have to watch this ever again to try and justify all the hype and apparent inspiration that surrounds it.

She did a phenomenal job from going to a caring, loving, nurturing mother figure to a psychopathic,vengeful mother all in an instance. Kevin Bacon was great in this as well he had some cool lines and being with a hot babe and lighting one up before having one of the coolest kill scenes in movie cinema especially horror cinema. The kill scenes were extremely creative thanks especially to the master of gore and makeup effects Tom Savini. Sean Cunningham did a great job in directing this horror masterpiece. Harry Manfredini's theme score rivaled John Carpenter's theme score Halloween. They both are the creepiest and recognizable scores of all time. Adrianne King was brilliant with her portrayal as Alice the strong and resourceful woman that survives that horrible night. She and Harry Crosby had great chemistry together along with Peter Brouwer. I loved the patrol cop scene when he's questioning the counselors there were some great funny lines for example ""Did you get off of a spaceship man"" and ""I told you to sit on it Tonto!"" and ""Can it Cochise"" just to name a few.

It's scary, it's original, it has backbone, it has balls, and it has a very realistic storyline to it.And when I say original, I'm serious.  Halloween WAS the first movie in the reguard of horror....but Friday the 13th was the first splatter/gore movie.Iscolated at Camp Crystal Lake, seven counselors must succomb to the terrible revenge of a deranged lunatic.  It's a scary premise...isolation is bad enough, but isolation with a killer is truly frightening.The killer in this movie is not Jason.  No walking dead corpses, no hockey masks, but a truly motivated killer.  Unlike current movies like Scream, the movie doesn't really throw out clues as to who the killer may be...it's not a whodunit, it's a terror movie.The counsilors are not stupid in this.  Sure, most of them (including the survivor) smoke pot (as did many young people of the time) and only 2 had sex.  The characters themselves did everything logically, they didn't do anything any normal person wouldn't do in a situation like the one presented.Even the survivor Alice (wonderfully portrayed by Adrienne King) did a few dorky things at the end, but we forgave her because in the spur of the moment, one cannot ALWAYS predict the right thing to do.The killer (whom I wont give away in case someone wants to see this) makes the killers in Scream 1 & 2, I Know...Summer, and others look like shallow shadows.  He/She has a very logical reason for doing it (the psychological effects can plainly be seen), unlike such rubbish as ""Your slut mother slept with my father, and that's why my mom left and abandoned me!!!""I highly recommend this movie to all...if you feel the need to see any others, then I guess parts 2 and 3 are okay.  4 is too.  But none of the others can be taken seriously (they are nothing but NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD rip-offs).The ending is probably the most memorable of many movies I've ever seen....Alice KNOWS he's still in the lake....he's still there...If you want to know what that means, I suggest you rent Friday the 13th and find out!  :)",Friday the 13th

I was terrified and when the unforgettable finale occurred and finished. I could feel my heart physically thumping against my chest. Then they hit me with one final scare (something which still gets me to this day), ended, and there I lay scared, thrilled and in utter euphoria. Horror movies I believe are one of the two best genre's there are (the other being drama). Although Friday the 13th is not one of the best examples of how good horror can be. It is a great film to watch when you are young and to watch the whole series from 1-9 is almost a rites of passage for every teenager (or film buff). The story is simple. A group of young people set up a holiday camp only to all get killed by a deranged lunatic. Its derivative now, but it was the first (Halloween is not a slasher film, its a proper terror movie) to do this kind of film. I have seen it since and time does not do it good. But I still love it and enjoy watching it. Dont expect a film classic. But if you like horror, watch this film and enjoy what it is.

I don't understand how this movie spawned sequel after sequel thus evolving into the colossal franchise that it now is. This was my first time watching this movie. I figured I'd been missing out on something great all these years, knowing how popular and massive this series of films is, and after watching the first one, I literally have no interest in watching the others.
This movie was super boring, there was literally almost no story or plot... the film feels VERY dated / it has not aged well at all, and that can't be excused by its release date, for there are many horror films released in the 60s and 70s (70s especially) that have aged far better than this one!
The characters are dumb. It doesn't seem believable that the killer was who she ended up being and managed to get away with / kill everyone that she did. The ""Final Girl"" is especially stupid, yet manages to outwit and outfight the killer... ummm.... yeah, okay.... sure....I get that this movie is a classic, that is spawned an entire franchise, but I think a large majority of Jason / Friday fans are ones who grew up with this movie. I have no nostalgia or sentimental lens to look at this film through, all I can do is look at it compared to other classic horror films that I've seen, and honestly... this one sucks. I'll take TCM, Nightmare on Elm Street, or even Halloween over this any day of the week. This movie honestly blows.
The only redeeming factors of this movie for me, were some of the kills were pretty gory and intense (there was some good use of practical effects, no doubt) and.... actually, that's the only redeeming factor I can think of.
The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 2 or 3 is simply because I've (unfortunately) seen even worse horror movies than this. While I could sit through this one at least, I still didn't care for and I'm truly mind-boggled how this movie created such a monster franchise and fandom.Maybe the sequels get better...? Maybe I should try watching those...? I don't know, but not sure if it's worth it to find out, either.",Friday the 13th

This movie had epic bloody deaths that lucky didn't have any good parts cut by the MPAA. It has a good pace since it wasn't a sequel. Before the actual intentional scary parts and chase scenes and stuff, i enjoyed seeing them introducing the characters, even though i don't care a lot about most of them. It does seem to get a bit boring at times just a little. And i saw the ending was made in a one of a kind way. And to me music can make a movie way more better, and the music for the chase scenes, the theme, and that great ending music. Overall, i like every other Jason movie except Part II better than this, I still think this is great to help give a good vibe around Friday the 13th or Halloween.",Friday the 13th
513,jackmoss88,Not worth the hype.,3,3 September 2005,"Friday the 13th has become one of the most recognisable franchises in horror, and Jason's hockey-masked, machete wielding killer a firm cinematic figure. However, stripping past this high-profile reveals one of the most bafflingly successful horror films of all time (I put it down to the freshness of the idea), as this really is a poor movie.For a start, it's terribly directed. There's an incredible over-use of extended shots (lasting several minutes) entirely on hand-held cameras, which start far away and draw slowly closer towards the characters. This was probably intended to build the tension, but it's so over-used you stop caring who's behind the camera. The film also uses that classic of cheap slasher films everywhere- the ""eyes"" of the killer. It's also incredibly badly paced. The film is over 100 minutes long, and yet that time seems to evaporate without explaining any of the background or developing a solid narrative. People start getting killed off very early, with no explanation. By the time anyone realises there's a serial killer on the loose- there's only one person left alive! Constant, drawn-out tension shots burn through the minutes, and the characters talk the usual filler that we're supposed to breeze over because we're clinging to our seat edges wondering what the killer's going to do next. The clincher is some very suspect editing- with shots lingering on long after anything left in the frame.Essentially, this is a cheap rip-off of Halloween, and it lacks John Carpenter's direction, John Carpenter's score, John Carpenter's knowledge of how to work the audience up and Donald Pleasance's brilliant armed doctor, who is that film's crucial source of important information. What's left lacks any suspense, and many scenes are even taken pretty much straight from Halloween. The fact that we never know who's killing everyone (they remain a pair of hands and a knife for the most part) destroys the point of the film. Even Tom Savini's gore effects are decidedly tame compared to his still impressive work on George A Romero's Dawn of the Dead a couple of years earlier.Does anything save this film? Well, ironically the best thing about it also removes the remaining good reason to see it. The acting in this film is actually reasonably good. I've seen countless zero-budget horror flicks and for such an amateur film, the acting is believable and consistent. Only trouble is that none of the characters are developed at all, so you really couldn't care less whether they die or not.This straight-faced acting actually removes the ""so bad it's good"" possibility from this film- even though it almost qualifies with perhaps the most unintentionally hilarious scene in movie history. We meet the generic superstitious old man (Ralph) at the beginning, but after he's done his customary ""you'll all die"" bit he re-appears later on. Apparently he walks twenty miles across country, into the camp without anyone noticing, and goes into a store cupboard, shutting himself in and standing in the darkness, waiting for someone to open it up so he can warn them again for all of five seconds before ambling off into the woods. Absolutely brilliant.Sadly though, even Ralph doesn't make this film worth watching. If you want a genuinely scary no-budget horror flick set in the woods- then I give you The Evil Dead.",Friday the 13th

I can't understand why this is considered a classic or spawned so many sequels, which by the way, get worse as you move on. I love low budget horror movies and have seen many of them that never get recognized and they are ten times better that this piece of crap. All of his has been done before in more interesting and intelligent ways. The acting of course sucks, there were no good surprises or twists, and its not in the least bit scary. I watched this movie when i was really young and scared of horror movies and this still didn't scare me. The only thing remotely creepy is the music that is being played when Jason is about to attack but that is it.

517,Nightflyre9,A classic of modern horror ...,10,26 September 2001,"Released in 1980, ""Friday the 13th"" was not only the heir apparent to the earlier and hyper-successful ""Halloween,"" but would spawn the ubiquitous slasher sub-genre that dominated most of the Eighties.  Movies like ""Prom Night,"" ""Terror Train,"" and ""My Bloody Valentine"" would benefit from the box-office success of ""Friday the 13th,"" which is to say nothing of the string of sequels it bore that turned a deranged killer into an iconic anti-hero for a disaffected generation.  A garishly graphic yet minimalist psycho-on-the-loose tale, this was an effective and engaging film, tightly directed and unapologetic in its lack of subtlety.  To this day, ""Friday the 13th,"" with its carefully constructed sense of claustrophobic isolation, tension-building camera work, and believable performances, is still a highly entertaining and influential movie that does not pretend to be anything else but a high-adrenaline terror trip.  Betsy Palmer chews the scenery in a climactic showdown that has been often imitated but never duplicated, and it is notable that the villain's motivation is entirely believable ... a fact that, to me, enhances the film's overall appeal.  ""Friday the 13th"" has earned a well-deserved place in the Pantheon of pop culture and is, without a doubt, a classic of modern horror.",Friday the 13th
518,jwikel,Alice is dumb.,5,14 August 2021,"I think Friday the 13th is an iffy movie. It's got good stuff, like some of the acting, the amazing gore by Tom Savini (a great goremaster), and even some of the humor. But, there is a lot of flaws. For one, the snake scene. They used a real snake. It was also a pet snake of one of the crewmembers. He didn't know they would kill it. They didn't even need the scene in the movie, and it costed them an innocent snake. Second, the 3 minute scene of Alice making coffee. We didn't need it! If we removed that scene and the snake scene, which would be 6 minutes less, it would still reach the 80 minute mark! We didn't need these scenes. Third of all, and the most frustrating, ALICE IS STUPID! She had a chance to drive away with Ms. Voorhees' car, but one body made her run away! It's just a body! Drive away! She also has a fully loaded gun, but she doesn't shoot her! She had the chance to shoot her in the 15 seconds of Voorhees just standing there, and also had the chance when she knocked her down, BUT SHE DOESN'T SHOOT HER! She also uses a canoe to go onto the lake instead of driving away with Ms. Voorhees' car! SHE'S A DUMBASS! I would have enjoyed the movie if Brenda or Annie were the final girls!",Friday the 13th
519,zainjohnson,"Iconic, but underwhelming",6,7 August 2021,"I love old slasher movies. In fact, I would say that John Carpenter's Halloween and Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre have become two of my favorite horror movies recently. But sadly, the original Friday the 13th is not one of those movies. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy it, and I think it's iconic in its own right. Those who've not seen this movie before may be surprised to know that Jason isn't even this movie's present slasher, but rather his mother, which I was quite surprised to find out myself.Moreover to the movie itself, however, it is apparent just from the opening scene that they are trying to replicate the opening to John Carpenter's Halloween (i.e. The opening POV shot showing the events that would be the catalyst for what's to come). And it's also apparent from the first couple kills that this was a film on a rather small budget. Basically the plot centers around a group of teens trying to open up a summer camp that's been closed for a couple decades and they are being killed off one by one by an unknown assailant (Jason's mom, Pamela). Overall, they don't seem to have a bad premise. It's a concept that would spawn a whole slew of summer camp slashers (such as Sleepaway Camp), but overall, not a bad idea for a slasher film.As far as gore goes, it just makes it even more apparent they were on a small budget. The effects in this movie are, well, dated, and haven't aged well. I mean, they were decent enough for the time, but by today's standards, they are rather crude.My final point in this review is that there are scenes that feel dragged out and overly elongated. They pretty much dedicate and entire scene to the film's final girl making tea, I guess to give you a sense of normalcy before the climax, but it really doesn't work here. It feels kind of tacked on and boring.Overall, not a great film, but far from horrible.",Friday the 13th
520,horrorforpresident,A classic horror film that will be remembered forever,10,22 February 2008,"Friday the 13th is one of the first original slasher movies, and one of my personal favorites to say the least. The film's near perfect music is just one of the many amazing features this film has to offer.Friday the 13th is a film that you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it. It's villain, and Total Films #100 most loved movie character of all time, Jason Vorheese, stars in the films as an insane phsycopath who kills for the sake of killing itself. What I personally love about the original film, is the directors ability to make so much happen on such a steep budget. Jason was just Jason in this first film, no mask no nothing. You barley even see him throughout the entire movie. All of the ""true"" Friday the 13th fans will know that Jason does not have the hockey mast until Friday the 13th Part III.The classic film is what many call one of the best horror films ever made, and I agree completely. Everything about it is perfect, and done just as it should.When we look at Friday the 13th we don't see meaningless killing and low budget gore. We see what the director truly wanted us to see, a masterpiece. a work of art that can never be topped. And a series that will live on forever.",Friday the 13th

Once we purchased a VCR, I rented it probably 15 times until it was priced for sell-thru in 1987. To me this movie and the following sequels are part of the definition of 80's culture. Every 12-18 months, these movies would pop up to the excitement of fans. The original, to me, is a great example of how a simple idea can be turned into a successful movie going experience. Is it a masterpiece...well, no. It is a movie that provides the shocks necessary to elevate it to the classic status it now has.

524,azerman18,Suspense + Killing = slasher,4,31 December 2014,"I had mixed thoughts about the film. The characters in the movie are stupid (how shocking, that never happens in a slasher film). One lesson is never get into a strangers' car. One of the characters does exactly that and she is killed. Mrs. Voorhees lures the characters into traps. She clips the power line and she attracts the teenagers to the powerhouse, just like how a spider attracts a fly. And then she goes for the kill. The makeup and special effects for the film are well done. The film is a blood fest and it possibly the first bloody/ gory slasher film. But the plot is incoherent and it is too focused on the deaths and the body counts. The characters are not really given personalities, except for the fact that they are all addicted to sex. We don't have much background of them either. If you haven't seen this film yet, you probably think the killer is Jason Voorhees. You are wrong. It is Mrs. Voorhees. A senior citizen- aged woman with a fleece sweater was not quite my original vision of Mrs. Voorhees. What I want to know is how an old woman is able to find all of them out of all the possible places on the camp within hours. I also want to know why the teenagers didn't just walk out of the camp. The film has the elements of a typical horror movie. It has its moments and there are suspenseful parts.

Not knowing who the killer is was scary until the end when it was a woman and not a man.  The whole time, I thought that a man was the killer because a man usually is the killer.  The woman was Jason's mother.  The acting was not that good to today's techonology, but in 1980, the techonology was not as good as that it wasen't discovered/invented yet.

Also, I love the location, the forest; Just thinking that the killer could be hiding behind any tree makes it so scary, also being the abandoned summer camp, and the rainstorm really give you the creeps. Next, it has much more creepy scenes than any horror I've seen (I've counted like 20+), especially the bathroom scenes and the scene with Brenda hearing the voice. But what really makes this movie scary, are the scenes where's there's no killing! Here's some the creepy scenes that actually creep me out: In the beginning where Ms. Voorhees walks into the cabin - The part where they're swimming and you see the hand of the killer touching the tree, then someone hears something and they go to a shot of the forest with nothing moving.... - The lights going out at camp - Steve getting killed - Jack getting killed - The bathroom scenes - the scene where Brenda's in the bathroom and she leaves, then it shows the light shaking...

The death-scenes are nicely produced with minor and sometimes major use of gore. The killer (whoever it is) is certainly unexpected and the suspense builds up until the nerve-wracking climax turns up! The characters are well developed and have a quite sophisticated and 2011-like humor and innuendo. The cast of teens are very attractive and innocent. The Friday The 13th: Deluxe Edition was beautifully remastered and it looked as new as the downgraded remake by Marcus Nispel. The movie overall is very suspenseful, and I love the setting for the film, the eerie woods. This film may have the most amazing setting. The film's ending may be very disturbing and the image of the scene is very traumatizing. Watchers please watch with your own discretion.

540,Raged_Maniac,Classic of the 80's Horror Flix,8,19 January 2005,"The first movie alone with the name makes it one to see just to say to friends you saw it. It does mislead a lot of younger people because the name is so famous with the big guy with the hockey mask even though it has very little to do with him. You do learn about Jason an how the story begins but it still has enough juice to keep one interested. I saw this movie in the theaters an I still get that feeling of fright watching this movie. A lot of Friday the 13th movies starred a lot of now famous actors an actress's starting with part 1 starring Kevin Bacon. Do not expect a Oscar performance by him but its interesting to see him so young. I now own all of these movies on DVD an enjoy most of them the last few were kind of dragging the name Jason a little out of proportion but what the hell make a little more money why not. This is a must see movie. I know many have already seen the higher numbered movies but one night sit an watch 1 though 4 (the best ones)an then one can appreciate the storyline.If you want to see a classic horror movie then this is a very good choice, just make sure you leave the lights on an the doors locked!!!",Friday the 13th

There's lots of blood, some creepy moments and it certainly makes you feel quite uncomfortable when it's close to the end. I guess that's perfect for a slasher film, but it really isn't enough to make a good movie.

Then they start getting killed off one by one in very gruesome ways , but not after getting involved in sex, drink and drugs.This film has spawned hundreds of copies which most have not come close to this. The ending was a big surprise when you find out who the killer was and the finale if that does not make you jump you have no emotion.The cast is not great but does not need to be, but it is nice to see a young Kevin Bacon get wasted, i feel that most of the credit must go to Tom Savini and his special effects which are great. all in all this really is worthy horror treat and a great shocker for its time...",Friday the 13th
543,MrScary,Slasher Films are born!,10,29 December 1998,"Along with Halloween, one of the most original and widely viewed horror movies over the last twenty five years.  Halloween brought back suspense, Friday showed us gore.  From the moment the audience sees a very young Kevin Bacon squered  through the throat with an arrow,  a new kind of horror film is on it's way to movie history; the teenage slasher film.  Done on a very low budget, with excellent special effects by Tom Savini, this movie set a precedent that was copied thousands of time; the more gore, the better.  The story was pioneering back in 1980, and unlike the horror films of today, original and suspenseful.  Although nine sequels were to follow (parts 2,4, and 7 are worth seeing), none captured the magic of the first one.  All real horror fans must see this film, and realize that 99% of all horror films since then are mere rip-offs.",Friday the 13th
544,belial-6,The one that started it all,10,19 July 1999,"Granted Halloween came out 2 years prior, but Friday is in no way a rip-off of Halloween. The plots don't even corrolate other than a 'crazy' person going around killing people, and if you want to get technical about it, then every 'slasher' horror flick is a ripoff of one another going all the back to the birth of horror in movies.You have a kid who killed his sister in Halloween to go on and age to adult hood and then try and seek out his other sister and kill her, all in one movie. Friday the 13th, Jason is only seen briefly at the end and revolves around his mother seeking revenge for allowing the camp counselors to let her son die while they were busy have sex!  Both, at first, are believable plots, a sibling (crazy) wanting to kill his sister, and a mother taking revenge because her son drowned. If we didnt know better, these may be headlines out of a local newspaper. But when it comes right down to it, how many horror films actually have believable plots anyway? And if i wanted something believable I'll go watch documentaries.It's hard to say how scary Friday was, it has been nearly 20 years! Yet it is synonomous with horror films. That alone should tell you something. Times have changed since 1980, more money is invested into the production of the movie, audience expects wild special effects, but in 1980 that wasnt the case. I wasnt fortunate to see the first friday in the theatres, but when I did see it for the first time, it was scary. Not to mention the fact I was going away to camp during the summers. The scene at the end of the movie forever burns a memory into your mind.The first one may not have been the scariest or the best, but it's the original, it spawned more direct sequels than any other horror film of its time.

Though these movies take a huge beating for being cheesy and stereotypical, I beg to disagree. Granted the whole idea of a holiday slasher was derived from the classic Halloween, what other movie series did it better than Friday the 13th (other than Halloween) These movies are great fun, and did even better considering drive in movies were the prime in their times. But as far as following a certain formula of characters getting whacked in the woods, it does do that but the characters aren't just blank canvases that die brutal deaths, they each had meaning and they all had there own personality traits, (which was something that was missing in later installments.) Granted this movie was a revenge story in the end, but ended up spinning into one of the longest running horror franchises in cinematic history. Plus the graphic and creative ways that the camp counselors are dispatched were very interesting as well. This movie will shock any who think that Jason Voorhees killed in every single one, you may just be surprised. Unless you've seen Scream, then it ruined it for you, thanks to Kevin Williamson.Point is, this movie is awesome. Just wait till you discover the death curse on Camp Crystal Lake!",Friday the 13th

Then it's reveled that the killer is some middle age woman who blames all fornicating teenagers for her sons death. Long story short she dies, and the only girl who didn't have sex lives. The majority of this movie is super corny sex scenes. If you see this movie out any where don't buy it. Even if it's a quarter. Buy gum instead. I don't care if you paid me I would refuse.

552,PrettyDead,A Legend in its' Own Time: Friday the 13th Part I,5,6 January 2010,"If you're a slave to story being the most important thing in a movie, and you're the type to go on and on about the scholar like ambitions in a filmmaker's writing of a graphic or exploitation horror film (and you know who you are- the type who might, for example, praise David Lynch or the weaker efforts of David Cronenberg), I pity you.This is not to say I think graphic films, exploitation, and horror films are best when they're dumb or don't try to be serious. Not at all. It's just that horror films have a formula. And no matter what you want to make your movie into, you always have to cheapen them just a bit to use violence for the sake of style or piling on dead bodies. A horror film is not a horror film without the classic Death Scene, or even several of them. Is this all a big lead-up to me praising Friday the 13th? No. It's just an excuse to say we can't be expected to take everything seriously.Films have always been a reflection of what happens in the world around us. Horror as a genre, however, is by definition: unrealistic. And absurd. And out of the ordinary. This is the perfect way to describe Friday the 13th. Which is a film (and later- a franchise) that has been bashed by serious folk for being too violent, gory, and in these excesses- depraved. Like it's really a professionally slick and oppressively dark film with a conservative agenda to punish young people either for indulging in ""bad things"" or for just being young. I don't think we need a movie to be depraved. What Friday the 13th really is is a simple frightfest scenario. Carefree, easy-going 19-20 year old's take their summer job at an abandoned camp which is getting ready to re-open. But there's a mysterious killer out there. You don't know who they are. Or where they are. Or when they're going to strike! And this is all a precursor to what Jason Voorhees became. Omnipresent, mysterious yet crude and somewhat hulking, and savage ""revenge"" slasher-killer.Friday the 13th is the definitive slasher film. Because it's not really about anything. But it sure became something, didn't it? The leader in entertaining ""And Then There Were None""-styled massacres with cool, bloody death scenes by the dozen. Completely absurd in terms of story, never making sense for a single moment. And filled with shrill, cold, quiet yet loud atmosphere in terms of darkness and isolation. It's truly become a legend. These elements. The white steam rising off the frozen water, wafting into the black night forest with green trees jutting up into your path, blue rain smacking everything in sight, yellow lights in cabin windows, flashlight beams fading into the eternal darkness. And of course... that sound. The unsubtle ""ch- ch- ch- ha- ha- ha"" just over your head. And that Harry Manfredini string section slicing through the air, through the peace of the gentle woods.It's not story that propels these movies forward. But it is a lack of quality direction that holds them back. With a lax focus on story and strong characterization, and a rushed low-budget filming schedule, results vary and often include painfully bad acting. The original Friday the 13th suffers much from this. Though by the end, it's really not that much of an issue anymore.",Friday the 13th
553,sylviapulp,A perfect slasher!,7,13 January 2003,"This film is top! If you like slashers you'll like this.  It's not original, but no one should expect that from this kind of film.  It includes all the basic rules as to who will die, such as drug use and sex, with the high point being our fully clothed heroin in a game of strip poker. Hilarious and perfect for a generic horror drinking game.",Friday the 13th
554,jeremynicholsv1,Friday the 13th (1980),10,3 April 2015,"Who hasn't heard of Friday the 13th? It's an iconic franchise launched in the 1980's during the height of the slasher genre, and helped write many of the rules that horror movies would follow after it. Sure, Halloween and even Black Christmas started the whole ""unseen killer"" era of horror movies, but Friday the 13th really kicked it up a few notches.The story here is easy to wrap your head around, which it needed to be to get to the blood and guts of the movie. The story centers around Alice, the new head counselor, and Steve, the new owner of Camp Crystal Lake. They bring out a number of other counselors to help rebuild the place and get it ready to open. Over the course of three days, one by one each teenager is killed before Steve gets it. Alice is eventually the last one left alive, and ends up meeting Mrs. Voorhees, who explains how her young son Jason drowned there twenty years ago while the teenage counselors ""made love"". This drove her insane, and she set about to kill any teenagers and anyone else that came out to Crystal Lake. The showdown between Alice and Mrs. Voorhees sets up the climax, where Mrs. Voorhees meets her demise via beheading.The look of the movie captures the feeling of being isolated out in the woods, adding to the scariness of the picture. The film moves along at a good pace giving watchers plenty of suspense. With kills every few minutes, you won't get bored watching this one.Who could forget the fantastic score? The creepy stalking music, the famous ki-ki-ki-ki that still sends a chill down my spine works so damn great here. The music is fantastic, and much like it did for Halloween, the music adds to the creepiness of the film.Tom Savini, the master of gore who worked on Dawn of the Dead among other films, really brought it here with the kills. For today's fans, they won't be impressed with the gore, for the time however it was pretty damn shocking. I still winch during the arrow scene, and the final kill of the film memorable.The one complaint I do have is the lack of character development, which won't always be a complaint from me (I swear) in future reviews. Here, however, we really only get to know Mrs. Voorhees and Alice, and we barely get to know them. The other characters are just glossed over here, and are mostly there for fodder. While this would be a normal occurrence for the franchise, there are characters that get plenty of back story and time to develop, just not in this one.This first movie is a toss up for fans thanks to Jason Voorhees, the killer for the majority of the franchise, not being the killer in this one. Spoiler alert for a thirty year old movie, the killer this time around is Jason's mother, Mrs. Voorhees (Jason does make an appearance at the end).Personally, I enjoy the movie even today. While it did bother me that Jason's mother was the killer when I first watched the movie as a kid, I attribute that to having seen the other movies first. I grew up watching the Friday the 13th movies, and this is one of the best in the series.",Friday the 13th

What a good horror movie. I didn't know that some 1980 extravaganza like this could blow my socks off, but, boy it sure did. But, it lacks plot holes and has noticeable mistakes. BIG MISTAKE: Alice puts the bucket down twice. (When Steve, Marcie, Ned and Jack are shaking hands.) But like all people, before I saw this movie 2 years ago, I though the 80's icon 'jason' was the killer. Wrong! Mrs. Voorhees... But what I don't get is that in some bits, she looks like a guy.

First you got this teenage characters that you will see in most slashers (a virgin girl, a slutty blonde, a hot douche guy, a goofy guy). Okay it maybe the basic rules of a slasher film but i don't even care about these characters, i don't even feel concern of their safety. And for that, it has no suspense for me. Then you have this mute first person camera antagonist. Okay it may be cool to make it a mystery, but the killer is the best part of the movie. And when i hope to get a great villain at the end. You got nothing but Jason's mom. Which is kinda lame and not scary at all. So with all of that, I rather watch other slasher franchise or even the sequels to this movie.

557,Nepfew33,Very Overrated,4,24 September 2006,"This movie is very overrated in my opinion sorry to all the Friday the 13th fan boys out there but this film isn't what everyone says it to be. Its nothing like Halloween as people compare it and its just a slightly below average slasher. Thats it there really nothing special about it. Just to say this film starts off with well some teens making out and then suddenly there off'd by a anonymous killer who the camera won't show. OK I'll give it to them here that very cool to me not being able to identify the killer right of the back. Something that really bothered me though was the girls death scenes they were so stupid didn't even try to fight back at all just running tripping over stuff and then with the girl throwing boxes at the killer acting as if the killer is really terrifying when you find out. That the killer is just some physcotic looking nanny with a Christmas sweater and yes it was Jason's mom. GET REAL!!!! shes wasn't even the least bit terrifying. It was annoying at the end with the girl and the moms final showdown and the chick kept knocking the old lady out and she'd keep coming back. KILL THE LADY DUMASS don't just keep knocking her out. Then at the end the chick slices the old lady's head off the gore whatsoever. I was little mad but it was all good the final scene of the move was incredible I think thats what gave this movie most of its credibility when the son Jason Voorhees who supposedly dead pops up as a ugly disfigured child and grabs here and pulls her under the water. KILLER I really didn't see it coming it was OK I guess but it had its problems trust me but it did make me yell ""RUN BITCH RUN!!!!! as hard as it to believe thats a good thing actually meaning I was kinda into it key Word: Kinda.

Tom Savini's make-up effects are absolutely brilliant. The gore keeps on coming.  Sean S. Cunningham made this one stand out against the rest (all of which were not awful, but could have been better) and the classic sound ""ch ch ch ch ha ha ha ha"" will give you goosebumps.If you absolutely love this movie, I recommend the sequels as well as other slasher movies such as Halloween and Nigthmare on Elm Street.All in all...an excellent horror flick.

Sean Cunningham may have directed this film mainly to make some profit returns after a disappointing small run of ""family"" orientated movies but I still think he was oblivious to what an effective little sleeper he was creating, easily his most significant work since ""Last House"" with Wes Craven.It was further helped because of when it appeared, with audiences trained and tuned for on screen gore after ""Dawn of the Dead"" and other films like ""Zombie Flesh Eaters"". And of course Tom Savini was on board to create the amazingly effective on screen murders.Although the movie can seem like just a routine slasher in terms of plot and murder set pieces today, people sometimes forget it was the film that spawned a million clones. It wasn't unoriginal at the time(although that is open to debate of course with both ""Bay of Blood"" and ""Halloween"" both sited as influence on the film and its sequels) and in fact created traits that have been copied countless times by other movies of its type.

On Friday the 13th, of course.Is it well-written? Not exactly. But there are plenty of great set pieces galore. This was before the MTV brand of film-making where loud noises and things suddenly jumping out at you qualified as ""scary."" This film takes its time to build up the tension before unleashing the scare, which in this day and age is sorely missing from most horror films. And atmosphere...well, it's got plenty of that to boot. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better setting suited for a horror film than the woods.

This was one of the most suspenseful of the series, right up there with Part II in that department.My fave scenes? The death of Jack, the scene leading to Marcie's demise, the final fight on the small beach, and Annie's chase. Some people see Alice as boring and typical, and far too innocent, but I think she was pretty developed (especially compared to many of the final girls of the LATE 1980s).

The camp then closes down. We then fast-forward about 20 or so years, and they are trying to open up Camp Crystal Lake to inner-city children. Seven counslers are to report and finish fixing up the camp to make it more suitable. However, someone isn't happy about them opening up. Someone begins stalking them, and then brutally murdering them, one-by-one. There are some throat cuttings, an axe in the face, a spear through the throat, a guy impaled on a door with arrows, a decapitation, and, of course, a few stabbings. Then, we get a twist as we head toward the climax as we find out the killer's identity and motive.This movie is one of the scariest movies i've ever watched. Like Halloween, the suspense slowly builds to an intense, very suspenseful climax. And, just when you think its all over, there is one last ""jolt"". I strongly recommend this movie. I also recommend Friday the 13th, Part 2 and Halloween.",Friday the 13th
570,blaughlin75,The movie that introduced the horror clichés to a wide American audience.,8,15 October 2006,"Although the conventions that this movie spawned had been done before in other forms, this is the classic camp slasher flick that created a stereotype which was imitated ad nauseum ever since. Halloween may have delivered a bit more suspense and contained better acting and more character development (while still being a bit cheesy in its own right), but this one was the gritty, shocking gore fest that made you scared to go to bed without looking underneath your bed first.The advantage this one has over all its sequels is that it contains mystery. You don't know who the killer is or what his/her motivation might be. You never see much of the killer until the end. As a result, all the deaths come out of nowhere. You never see the killer picking up a weapon or approaching a victim. You just see shadows, brief glimpses, or nothing but a hand yielding a weapon. In addition, the shots of the lake, the trees, and the approaching storm look as real as can be, allowing you to slip into the movie without feeling like it's telegraphed.One of the problems with this movie is that almost half the murders come off-screen. I have read that this a a result of shoddy looking special effects. This is a disappointment since the kills we do get to see are wince-inducing. Another problem is that in all the brief glimpse you get of the killer throughout the movie, it looks like a man. Remember the shot of his/her legs as he/she runs after Annie in the woods. Those were man legs, IMO. The killer, of course, turns out to be an older woman. Also, Mrs. Voorhees moves pretty fast to through Brenda's body through the window at Alice and run to get her jeep, which she drive up just about two minutes later.All in all, this movie is a classic. It is the blueprint for many to come. It offers gore effects which were shocking for their time. And the story line rings true and unsupernatural, unlike future Fridays.",Friday the 13th

The acting is horrible, the writing is horrible, and the cinematography is pathetic. The film is too obviously low budget, but not even more money could salvage this turkey of a movie. The film has no thrills, in fact it's PAINFULLY boring. Anyone with half a brain could've written a screenplay better than this. Although the idea of a bunch of teens getting slaughtered at a dark camp by a lake is a rather good premise for a horror movie, it isn't used well here. There's nothing enjoyable about this movie. It's most definately the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought ""Halloween"" was bad, but ""Friday the 13th"" makes ""Halloween"" look like something just short of Shakespeare.

Horror films are not complex pieces of art, thus do not need heavy critique. So on one of my friends recommendation me and a group of friends checked out the original ""Friday the 13th"".The only thing that scared us in the end was how this film became so iconic. It was strikingly similar to ""Halloween"" (although to be fair to Cunningham, that did inspire it), only with more unnecessary gore, and contained a villain that heavily resembled Norman Bates from ""Psycho"".The lack of scares was frustrating, due to the skill Cunningham obviously has. Any moments that could have been scary were quickly sacrificed for violence and gore. Cunningham deserves points for attempting to develop the characters, but in the end you really don't care about them in the slightest, which wouldn't matter if the film had built up suspense more prominently.",Friday the 13th

And the plot was nonexistent if that. But I think what really let me down was that I didn't care about any of the characters. And I'm not just saying that either, I really didn't care. None of them were even remotely interesting or unique. And some were just downright annoying. (I think maybe the director figured that out since the most annoying of the characters died off screen.) The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that I liked that we never saw the killer until the end. It reminded me of Halloween whenever we saw through the killers eyes. But I liked how this time we didn't know who the killer was. Overall though, I gotta say I was hoping for more. See, I'm just now starting to delve into the ""Classic"" horror genre, and after seeing this and Halloween, I'm a little worried about the rest of the films.",Friday the 13th

In no way is it a good film but it is a guilty pleasure that should keep you entertained for an hour and a half. The gore is good thanks to Tom Savini and the music (including the famous ki-ki-ki ha-ha-ha) is all in keeping with the mood. The acting is lousy but what did you expect.Conclusion:This is not a movie that is going to change your life and it probably isn't the best slasher film you will ever see.

The good part is that for a horror film it does manage to build up a good amount of tension and you are struggling to think who the killer could be. The way the murder scenes get more and more graphic also impressed me. Now then the killer is revealed as an old woman, just how scary is that. Not very is the answer and when she makes those stupid voices it just got ridiculous.  Even worse was the way that this old woman kept getting smacked on the head with blows which would knock a full grown man out, never mind an elderly woman and just keeps getting straight back up and continues to automatically find the girl.

The Camp has been closed for so long due to a number of catastrophes such as the young boy Jason Voorhees drowning in the lake, cabins catching on fire, and (I almost forgot) tons of camp counselors being brutally slashed and murdered by a killer running loose in the camp. So when the camp is being reopened, its deja vu, the new camp conselors are in for it. The killer is back and is ready for more. This is the movie that started in all, the classic slasher series that has a total of 11 films to date. The movie is good, but don't expect a truly scary horror film. Its full of some tense moments, nice jumps, and gore, lots of gore. What it lacks is some decent acting (not very impressive).

All the classic horror clichés are in this, yet they pull it off, probably cause it was pretty original at the time. If you like some cool and a few funny death scenes, then you will surely like this one. The effects and make up artists are great for the time, with none of that computerized crap that you see now days. This is surely a movie you watch at midnight with a nice blunt to let get you into the mood. The actors are also surprisingly good and the setting is great. A low budget horror film indeed and sometimes those are the best, as most horror fans already know. I loved this movie from the start and so should you. If not then oh well.

The movie is full of gory deaths, great acting and a great storyline. A woman serial killer? Wow.The movie is all based on the events of the 1950s (not a true story) when the woman's child, Jason Voorhees, drowned in Crystal Lake. The woman's name is Pamela Voorhees. She goes insane, vowing to kill every counsellor in the Crystal Lake area. However, as I said when the killer is revealed, she is revealed to one character, who then chops her head off after a brutal fight between the two ladies.This movie is excellent. Not the best in the series, but awesome. This movie involved great acting, and some actors and actresses who would later go onto fame and fortune (such as Kevin Bacon who stars as Jack).

With its iconic music, to loads of memorable scenes that will send shivers down your spine this movie has a pretty good variety of a slasher film, especially in 1980. This film is actually a pretty graphic horror film too, with 3 extremely iconic deaths. Plus the effects for some of the kills are down right amazing, and still hold up too this day. Sure, Jason isn't in the film but allow me to explain how that works. When Friday the 13th (1980) came out we had no idea who Jason was, while when A New Beginning came out we knew about Jason and not seeing this iconic character in that film sucked a little. And plus Pamela Voorhees is a great slasher killer and is pretty damn creepy too. However yes, this film has not aged well which held it back from a 10/10.

The movie has its scares and jumps and not to mention some blood/gore effects, which are done nicely by Tom Savini. I recommend the movie for teens to watch (age 15, not 13) because the characters act just like teens in today's world. The movie got an R rating for obvious reasons. Blood, Gore, Extreme violence including a decapitation, and several uses of the F word all contributed to the rating. Parents be warned, this is not appropriate for anyone under 15.

603,bigddy83,Campy fun for counselors,6,15 February 2004,"Friday the 13th (1980)95 MIN- R **Camp Crystal Lake is affectionately known as `Camp Blood' and for good reason.  It's got a death curse.  And on Friday the 13th, the young, dumb, sex obsessed counselors are going to find that out `the hard way'.  Or should I say `the sharp way'!  This film has more suspense than your typical cardboard cutout imitation.  This is mostly due to an unsettling mood, creepy score by Harry Manfredini, and an isolated setting.  Cunningham directed this low budget project just to tie him over until a TV series, about soccer of all things, got picked up.  Adrienne King plays Alice Hardy, who is as convincing as a heroine as Roberto Begini is as a super hero. Rounding out the rest of the cast are Harry Crosby (Bing's son), Laurie Bartrum, Mark Nelson, Jeannie Taylor, and a very young Kevin Bacon in one of his first screen roles.  Robbi Morgan (wife of TV's 'Russian Roulette's Mark Wahlberg) makes a brief appearance as Annie, the hitchhiking cook, that is murdered in the woods.  The late NY character actor Walt Gorney appears briefly as Crazy Ralph, the drunk town loon.  The best offering in the film comes from Betsy Palmer who delivers a terrifying, bloodthirsty performance as Mrs. Voorhees, the grief stricken mother of a murdered boy from the camp, years ago.  The contrived premise of the film does not detract it from delivering the goods in a gory, grisly fashion.  Shot on location in New Jersey and inspired by Mario Bava's `Twitch of the Death Nerve' and Agatha Christie's `Ten Little Indians', Friday the 13th provides a somewhat organic and carnal look at psychotic behavior.  Tom Savini's gruesome special effects provide excellence in creating the unsettling frame of mind needed in a mindless film like this.  This box office smash paved the way for coutless rip-offs not to mention 9 sequels, a spin-off, and an ill-fated TV series by name only.  Associate produced by Steve Miner (billed as Stephen), the director of Part 2 and 3.

And I really enjoyed this film as a horror film, but I wouldn't really revisit it unless I was going to rewatch the series in full. The movie in between kills is generally very mundane and boring. And nothing really happens other than teenagers (you know what) and random conversations that don't matter a whole lot to the films plot. But all of that aside, the actual kills themselves are absolute classics of the series and impressive looking considering they only had a $550,000 budget. Betsy Palmer was great as Pamela Voorhees and was definitely the star of the movie. Her death is absolutely epic and badass, and one of the highlights of the film.

Still, it wasn't a bad movie - worth watching for genre fans. At least for some nice killing scenes. Now I can't wait to see part 2 to see how this turns out.

My friends and I usually have a ""Friday the 13th"" party when ever that particular calendar date rolls around, and it completely changes the experience of watching the movie.

609,bulldogbill18,Gotta see it on the BIG SCREEN,10,27 June 2014,"For the past year I have been wading through a lot of these reviews with poor ratings and wonder why so many people are down on this movie. This type of movie(slasher)was designed to give you a roller-coaster ride, to scare you, period. There is little to no character development for a reason, so you don't get too bummed when someone is killed and zone out of the movie. This movie was designed to scare you, let you calm for a bit and then scare you again-hence the roller-coaster analogy. I was 18 when I saw this in 1980 in a real theatre with a screen larger than my 52"" LCD, unlike today's multi-plexes. I walked out of there really scared and this movie left an indelible mark on me. Recently, I went to Blairstown, NJ on a Friday the 13th. The movie was shot in Blairstown and at a BoyScout camp just outside the town. The town plays the original movie every Friday the 13th in the historic theatre there. The theatre was packed and dark, the screen was good sized and the sound system was cranked up with tons of bass. I have to tell you, I have seen this movie probably 100 times since the first viewing back in 1980, but this scenario brought back why it was so effective back then. Watching a movie at home with a large flat screen TV is cool, but even with a really good surround sound system, it loses much of it's impact. The background score playing much louder than your surround permits, really keeps the mood frightening and the loud jarring noises become terrifying. Strangers screaming around you really makes a difference you can't get at home. I was surprised to see the audience scream wildly when Jason popped out of the lake at the end and I thought everyone knew the ending. So I say to you, if you ever get a chance, watch this movie at a real theatre with a BIG SCREEN, go. If you aren't a fan, it might change your mind or at least surprise you somewhat. Remember, rollercoasters aren't for everyone, but they are cool.",Friday the 13th

Though it was more graphic (since it was the last created it had the most advanced technology), i felt it was corny and a waste of my time, for the most part, and Im 13 years old. The character is what makes me enjoy the series the most the way Jason is portrayed, but the movie itself is not very disgusting to me because the blood looked like ketcup! But for an old movie i give it a lot of credit. I was not scared, but there were a few occasional surprises. If you are my age or even 15 i recommend you are careful where and when you watch this movie because it is very graphic when it comes to nudity. I mean, they show everything! I was a little disgusted in that sense as well as the various ""scenes"" if you know what i mean. I think they over did that a bit. there were like 4 or 5 in each movie from the series. But overall watch these movies and share my love of JASON VORHEESE!",Friday the 13th
611,marice-boyd,Still chillling,8,1 April 2012,"Friday the 13th is an excellent chiller. It's imaginative death scenes, and it's creepy setting are what make it so great. When I first saw the movie I stopped it when Neddy went into that creepy cabin after seeing someone on the porch, of course I was just a kid and that little bit scared the p*** out of me. The second time I watched it(as a teen)all the way through, I already knew who the killer was, but there were so many parts I hadn't seen it was like watching it for the first time and it scared the p*** out of me again. I jumped and literally yelled at the end when Jason jumps out of the lake, Kevin Bacon and his girlfriend's death shocked me beyond belief, and the killers voice freaked me out so much I admit, I turned away from the screen. This movie has come to be my favorite horror movie of all time, I still can't watch it without getting scared or at least getting that feeling in your stomach which moves up to your heart and makes it beat so fast that you can feel your heart in your mouth and then you jump and it returns to normal. It's a great feeling, and only this movie does that to me every time I watch it. Watch it you'll feel the same thing. It is very good, very suspenseful, and very scary. Even listening to that unforgettable music(Ch ch ch ah ah ah) can scare you enough. Try watching it without any shudders, it's impossible.",Friday the 13th
612,sadisticcynic,Skip it.,2,30 October 2004,"Many people hail this as a ""cult classic"". I am a fan of horror and cult movies like this, but personally, I recommend you skip this one. I have not not seen the others in the series, but if they are like this movie, I will not see it.This is the supposed plot: A group of teenage J.Cs at a mysterious camp site called ""Camp Crystal Lake"" are terrorized by an unknown killer (NOT Jason) who doesn't show his/her (I'll avoid spoilers, as if anyone should see it) face until the last ten minutes of the movie.But here's the more accurate plot: A group of horny kids sit around and a vague omen pops up here and there. This goes on for two thirds of the movie, and needless to say, it gets pretty boring. Suddenly, it's the end, and a killer with horrible acting runs in and a chase scene begins. The final battle isn't much too look out for, either. It basically consists of this: hero hits killer, killer is stunned, hero runs, killer jumps from behind a bush. Repeat.I'll give the movie this: the ending gives a complete feeling but leaves plenty of room for suspense.However, even if you are looking for a cheesy movie with unintentional laughs, I recommend you look somewhere else. This movie isn't so much ""funny cheesy"" as it is ""boring cheesy"". And ""boring cheesy"" isn't entertaining.I only recommend this movie if you are a total die-hard to the Jason series. But even then, you might not want to see it, because Jason only makes the briefest appearance at the end.",Friday the 13th
613,countspookula,Friday The 13th Review,6,26 June 2014,"Watching this movie, you can't help but wonder just what made this movie turn into such a popular franchise, spawning 11 sequels, a remake, a comic series and a television show. Well, for starters, it jump started the Camp setting for horror movies and brought it into the mainstream. There were SO many camp-cult horror films in the 80's, it makes my head spin thinking about it. It's a good movie. It offers some cheap scares. The characters are pretty unrecognisable (with the exception of Kevin Bacon) and it's about as tense as shredded wheat. But you have to love it- awesome kills, a surprise ending, good effects, and an overall fear of spookiness. It's a classic, and while it may not be the best horror film ever, you can't turn it down.",Friday the 13th
614,matthew-brown1,great film,10,2 November 2006,I have seen this film a couple of times now and I have enjoyed it.I remember first seeing it in the early 80's and it was pretty frightening as I was only young at the time i am waiting for a book called crystal lake memories which i have heard is a good book i have one book called making Friday the 13th by David grove.Certain scenes gave me a bit of worry when I saw it back in the 80's.I have just seen Halloween for the first time and that is a good film the films music is quite scary at times.The characters are interesting as well and the locations are beautiful.We have a wooded area here outside Chelmsford which looks a bit like crystal lake woods so it is a bit haunting at times.,Friday the 13th
615,lilmikey42291,An Overrated movie,1,20 April 2006,"Okay, I do not see at all how Friday the 13th (1980) (or any of its endless sequels for that matter) can be considered a classic. Sure it gave use legendary killer Jason (actually it was Part II to be accurate) I know typically horror movies generally are not known for their great acting abilities, but come on. The only decent acting comes from Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, and Kevin Bacon. Their is no significance to almost any of the characters and it seems as if they are just walking around waiting to be offed. The script is crappy and so is the directing. The movie only cares about blood and sex which in my opinion shows the signs of a ""bad"" horror movie. I mean look at some of the intelligent and clever horror movies that came around at the same time- ""Halloween"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" etc. I also don't understand how this movie generated so many sequels that only get worse as the series pretty much drags on. Heres an interesting fact: Betsy Palmer said ""the only reason I accepted the role was because I needed the money to get my car repaired"" and in fact called the movie ""a piece of s**t"" I agree Betsy.Ugh. Horrible 1/10",Friday the 13th
616,lassprite,Surprisingly emotional slasher,9,24 March 2018,"Having been on a Friday binge lately, the time finally came to re-watch the original for perhaps the first time in a decade. Two things struck me immediately: 1. Kevin Bacon is in the movie and 2. how well it holds up. Granted, it's nearly 40 years old so the acting and effects aren't always the crispest, but overall it holds up very well, even better than some of the later installments. The movie also contains a sentimentality that the later ones do not; before the series turned into the Jason Voorhees hack-fest we all know and love, it was about a mother who loved her little boy so much she went mad. After the finale ending with the protagonist Alice decapitating Ms. Voorhees (praise Tom Savigni), we get Alice floating floating around in a canoe in Crystal Lake, while the sweet end theme by Harry Manfredini plays, until the infamous Jason-bursting-out-of-the-lake shot into Alice waking up in the hospital. We see some nice dialogue in the hospital as Alice and a police officer briefly talk about the events, ending with this:
Alice: ""The boy, is he dead too?""
Police officer: ""The boy?""
Alice: ""The boy, Jason.""
Police officer: ""Jason?""
Alice: ""The one who attacked me, the one who pulled me underneath the water.""
Police officer: ""Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.""
Alice: ""Then he's still there...""
cue a zooming-in shot of Crystal lake into end credits while the melancholic end theme plays again, highlighting the sadness of the little boy who drowned in the lake all those years ago. I got close to shedding a tear here. This piece of dialogue is also a brilliant foreshadowing of what was to come. 
Overall, a well done tragic slasher which by all means deserves to be viewed as a classic in the horror genre.",Friday the 13th
617,juho-93792,For those who like mindless slashers,5,1 August 2021,"There's no denying the legacy this movie has left behind in pop culture. Having said that, this movie is quite below average even for its time.The acting feels cheesy and forced for the most part, excluding some scenes towards the end of the movie. The plot is very basic and the movie feels really shallow. The movie doesn't explore or build up the characters, they are there to be killed. If you don't build up the characters of the victims or the killers, I'm left wondering why do I care about what's gonna happen to anyone.Music, atmosphere and overall sound effects are pretty good. I feel like they could have done much more with the setting other than having most of the teens die in the cabins. Of course taking into account the time this was released, the kills were quite good.This is a movie for people who enjoy mindless slasher movies and ""fun"" kills. I'm not one of those people, but I can see the appeal for other people.",Friday the 13th

I watched it the other day and it felt like a parody.
The first scene was laughably bad, me and my family, one of which was previously traumatized, laughed.
No on screen deaths throughout and the final part in which Jason jumps out the lake is just a dissapointment, a poor jumpscare that ruined the realism of the movie, well the shard of it that was left.
All the death scenes were laughable, and it basically just aged horribly.
If you'd ask me the rating in '80 Is give it a nine.",Friday the 13th
620,Steve-119,THE Classic Slasher Film,10,9 April 1999,"Possibly the scariest film I've ever seen, Friday The 13th is the kind of movie that you show to people who don't know anything about horror films. After they see this, they know what they are about.  Best watched late at night in darkness, especially with a storm outside.  Even though the Jason most well-known (the mask-wearing, nearly invincible one) never shows, he does make a drop-in at the end of the movie as a little boy.  That scene with the canoe gave me nightmares when I first saw it as a little boy.Overall, I highly recommend this movie to ANYONE WHO LIKES MOVIES. Obviously if you like horror films then you've already seen it.  The rest of the Friday The 13th Series does not live up to this one, but most of them aren't terrible; Part 6 is a great one if you like fast action and some humor.

622,lhdwe,"A horrendous film of terror, gore, and suspense that never loses its flair.",10,29 November 1999,"Despite the eight sequels that were spawned over the following twenty years, perhaps none of them had quite the same effect on the horror genre than the original film, Friday the 13th.  Believed by fans and critics alike to be one of the pioneers of the modern horror genre, Friday the 13th contained a horrendous atmosphere of suspense and despair like no other film of its time, with its terrifying intensity and creative murder sequences never failing to please.Camp Crystal Lake has been silent for nearly twenty years, due to several viscious murders which remain unsolved.  Numerous attempts to reopen the camp have been thwarted with mysterious fires and tainted water.  Now, the camp's new owner and seven young counselors are preparing for another reopening despite the claims of a ""death curse"" by local residents.  The story is regarded as mere craziness until Friday the 13th, when one by one each of the counselors is stalked and brutally murdered by an unseen killer. Who is responsible for the murders, and what is their involvement the the drowning of a young boy decades earlier?The film features suspense like none other, as scenes can often feature several minutes of silence, despite the killer's obvious presence.  No two murder sequences are alike, as the young counselors are stabbed, maimed, impaled, slashed and axed in this gory romp.  In the end there is one survivor and an intense chase sequence with an unforgettable ending. However, just when you think it's over, the film strikes back with a terrifying ending sequence that the viewer will never forget.  If you have no idea it's coming, you may need to excuse yourself to the restroom momentarily.Although the Friday the 13th series is chock full of sequels, perhaps none of them can compare to the sheer intensity and suspense of the original. Unlike the later films, the key of the original is its psychological terror, not just the physical blood and gore.  This film is worth a late night viewing and most likely worth purchasing.  Truly an integral piece to the modern horror puzzle.",Friday the 13th
623,rjeromson,Good make up effects but film is disappointing and dull.,2,23 June 2000,"My first encounter with this most infamous of slasher films was on late night television when I was about 12 years old.  It seemed to me, at the time, to be just about the coolest thing I had ever seen.  Now at 24 I have a somewhat less than affectionate view of it.  So what has changed in the last 12 years, not a whole lot in terms of the genre of films that I appreciate the most, except for the fact that I have had the dissatisfying experience of sitting through parts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in various stages of censorship.  The quality, or lack there of, of part one hardly justifies the enormous investment that must have gone into producing it's many numbered clones.  Still somebody, like me, paid to see them I guess.  The originals cult status I am a loss to explain.  Set on friday the 13th (of course) the story centres around a group of nubile camp councellors out in the woods for a weekend of booze and bonking.  But from the opening minutes of the film it appears frighteningly obvious that not many of them are going to make it out alive as someone, who I won't reveal here, starts hacking through the supporting cast. It would be great to say that there is something, anything, in this film that separates it from the rest of it's kind, but there simply isn't.  It owes more than a little to 'Halloween', it's stalk an slash melodrama just isn't original.  There is on thing I will say however, and that is that Tom Savini's grizzly make-up effects do make the grade, even by todays standards, freeze frame them if you like, they are pretty flawless (my personal favourite:  Kevin Bacon's bed side skewering). The film is dull, and pretty disappointing, badly acted and flatly directed I can't help but get the feeling the Sean S. Cunningham has just yelled ""action"" at every cut.  There is one thing you can count on though and that is that somewhere in the world on this most superstitious of dates some T.V. network will hash it up and run it again for old times sake.  If you find this to be the case, by all means watch it and watch out for that final fright, it's a doozy. In my discussions with friends 'Friday the 13th' comes up quite a bit.  I do admire it on some level I certainly admire it's staying power but I don't find it entertaining and I don't go out of my way to watch it.  Sitting alone on a dusty video store shelf it waits for a new generation a horror addicts to find and who knows, maybe in another 12 years I will see it again, late one rainy night the glass in the opening titles will shatter and I will once again be reminded of what it was like to be a 12 year old kid with the run of parents video machine.",Friday the 13th
624,scaryscreenplays,The Best Slasher Flick I Have Ever Seen!,10,27 July 2000,"Unlike the modern horror movie killers of the 90's, Mrs. Voorhees, the sagacious and brutal killer in this flick, is creepy. Betsy Palmer did an incredible job in brilliantly transfiguring herself into this--should I rightly say--satanic killer. Hearing the spooky music by Harry Manfredini is enough to scare you even without having seen the movie. Proof of this is that I, being a musician, am able to play the music to this movie by ear. When I played it for my class in chorus they told me to ""stop or they would have nightmares"". The acting, though admittedly boring, is very realistic, not exaggerated as in the 90's slasher flicks. The murders--if you get the uncut version--are no joke. They are frighteningly realistic and can be pretty gruesome as well as horrifying to a high degree! Most of us say this movie set the standard for modern horror, but also remember who made this movie horror--Mrs. Voorhees. She can, indeed, be called the ""mother of horror"" because she set the standards and everyone else follows in awe. My regrets is that they did not make another ""Friday the 13th"" film with her in it.Please give this movie a chance. I believe you will love it. My friends played it in class at school, and they loved it death.

After 10 sequals (including Freddy VS Jason) this is the one that actually stands up after 25 years. I mean granted that seeing Jason killing people in 9 movies is alot of fun. But it gets tired and dragged down after awhile. But the first is origanal, scary, has the best effects, cool characters, and two killer endings.The film is pretty straight forward when it comes to plot. A summer camp has a terrible tragedy. A young boy drownds. The camp counselors who are supposed to be watching this young boy are having sex. And someone gets a little p***ed off.Ahead we go to present day. Where the camp is readying the camp for re-opening. The town is against this. They say the place is cursed and no one should enter. There have been murders, fires, water poisoning. But of course no one listens and all plans go forward to reopen the camp. But then someone is stalking the camp counselors and killing them off one by one. In cool, gross, nasty ways. You gotta love it!So I have to say everytime I watch this film its like I am watching it for the first time. I never get tired of it. I love everything about the movie. Even the actors don't annoy me like they did in the later sequals. And this movie is scary and has alot of great suspense and chilling moments.
But the best part in the finale. Granted the last 30min is then ending so it kind of drags out. But its our heroine against villan. In about a 20min chase scene that is great. And then seeing the killer's head chopped off was a HUGE shock and was awesome. So just when I think the film has ended like a predictable slasher should. Another chain of events happen that scared me and got me going 10 times more then seeing the killer's head chopped off.Trust me this movie kicks ass! And if your tired of seeing the same old Jason walking and killing people. Come back to its roots and watch the orignal. It might not have Jason in a hockey mask. But it still is a classic and a great horror movie. **** out of ****",Friday the 13th

Friday stands on it's own merit as the first serial killer horror movie with a high body count. Another contributing factor to the endurable greatness of this film is the fact that the motive behind the murders is saved until near the end. The character development is subtle, but present. There is Mr. Christy, who wants to make the camp a success after taking it over from his family. He has an attraction to his right-hand employee, Alice, who may have to go back to California to take care of some personal business. There is a love triangle of sorts involving Kevin Bacon's character, his girlfriend and their best friend,Ned. Local crazy,Ralph tries to warn the lot to no avail and the murders happen. And Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Vorhees is the would-be scene stealer were it not for the formidable performance of Adrianne King who hasn't done much since this movie and it's sequel probably because of the association to her character. The population of this movie with people who seem real, not too melodramatic makes a wonderful partnership with Tom Savini's special effects artistry.This is the most realistic stuff I've ever seen on film. The soundtrack is unforgettable. The name of the composer is right on the tip of my tongue, but alas, it escapes me.The stories told in the sequels really don't hold up against the first one. I am more sympathetic to the killer(s) in the earlier movies as tragic victoms of grief rather than being evil. This less-dramatic plot device makes the movie all the scarier.There is a sequel, or rather a re-imagining of Friday the thirteenth in the works.

Although the whole bunch of characters are pretty one dimensional, there are some scenes that are pretty stand out. One particularly stands out, because it is the first ""modern"" encounter with the killer. The innocent, naive teenage girl getting a ride to the oh-so famous Camp Crystal Lake. I found it particularly terrifying when I first saw it because it's a large amount of terror- during the daytime. Many movies always stick to night time horror, but Friday the 13th is terrifying whenever it wants. It's also particularly funny to see a young Kevin Bacon. Yes, we may have seen and heard the movies/stories of camp counselors getting knocked off, but Friday the 13th made a name for itself. I must give a generous amount of props to that music and other noises, and it deservingly is cemented in pop culture(cheecheecheeahhahhahh.) This is a very entertaining movie, and although it may not be Grade A, it sure as hell can be as entertaining as one(at the worst a Grade C.)",Friday the 13th

644,steve-1986,"The original ""stalk n slash"" movie",10,6 April 2003,"-POSSIBLE SPOILERS-Although this film does seem very dated now people must remember that if this film was never made, its wouldn't have spawned 9 sequels, the Halloween sequels wouldn't have been made, Freddy Krueger and A Nightmare On Elm Street wouldn't exist, therefore neither would Scream. The reason this film accomplishes so much is because you do not see the killer until the very end, tension builds up as you're wondering who the killer is, unlike the many sequels. The plot is simple and the acting is quite terrible and people just say ""its just another slasher flick"" but this was the original slasher flick, and was immitated by many people afterwards. 9/10",Friday the 13th

It all started off with a little boy named Jason. Who appears as the killer in the later films. Who drowned while the consolers were making out. His mother then kills the campers every year of his birthday. Camp Crystal Lake has a creepy feel to it. This movie is why i'm scared of the woods. The camera angles are spot on. The music makes the movie more scary. The ending scared the hell out of me. Plus it was pretty funny to. It is campy but good.I recommend this film to anyone who likes horror movies.,Friday the 13th
647,BeastMcCoy,For those of you unlucky enough to watch this movie...,2,17 February 2009,"Once in a while a movie comes along that is so terribly, terribly bad that you could almost cry for the lost time you gave to it. Angry and frightened, you feel like you should tell someone (anyone!) what happened, because it feels like a crime has been committed. But who would listen? Only you and the movie know what happened, and the movie's not telling. Such a movie is the original Friday the 13th. By rights, this movie should have been good. Obviously I wasn't expecting a Citizen Kane or a Gone With the Wind, but when one considers that Friday the 13th has spawned eleven various sequels, mash-ups, and remakes which, taken together as a franchise, have grossed nearly $500,000,000 worldwide, that might raise the expectations slightly. Those numbers would make any movie studio proud, and such a cinematic juggernaut has to be based on an incredibly strong foundation, right? The answer is ""not so much,"" actually. Watching the first film, one gets the sense that the sequels are basically unplanned pregnancies that just sort of happened, and not the result of careful planned franchise-hood.Truly, I gave it every chance to succeed. I even coaxed it like a puppy, or a tiny sprout: ""Come on, little guy, you can do it."" Guess it just wasn't my lucky day, but isn't that the point?Why is this overrated ""classic"" so bad, you ask? Well, it has almost no plot or characters, and no real sense of purpose. At all. Really. It just sort ofis. I swear there is a five-minute scene of a girl making coffee, and that about sums up the film. Clearly, it was a great directorial decision to establish beverage preference before such superfluous things as motivation and personality. As a result of such ground-breaking work, the pace of this movie is somewhere between amateur golf and colonoscopy, tending towards the latter. That's how I love my horror movies; you never know what's going to happen next. Will she use one teaspoon of sugar or two? Will she stir clockwise or counter-clockwise? Oh, I can't take it! That's the kind of edge-of-your-seat, beaded-sweat-on-the-brow tension you can only get at the nursing home during naptime. And the best part is, after all that wonderfully taut buildup, you just know you're going to get to see another fantastically realistic, squeal-inducing death, delivered by a master thespian. It has been my experience that in most movies, the actors are the ones who usually act. Interestingly, actors were not required for this one. As a result, most of the killings look like people having painful gas or pretending to pass a kidney stone while trying to recall masterful dialogue lifted from Bazooka Joe wrappers. Why this film didn't win any Oscars is one of the great, enduring mysteries of Hollywood. Still, despite its nearly-complete cinematic insouciance, some ardent fans defend this movie ferociously, citing its ""iconic"" appeal and cult status. They rebuff criticism that Friday the 13th is a rip-off of superior films such John Carpenter's Halloween or the Italian-made Reazione a catena among others. Instead, they rally behind its ""old-school"" reliance on the audience's imagination, and the feeling of atmospheric dread it inspires in the viewer. I'm all for imagination, but I'm not going to imagine the whole movie, because the director lacks the originality and skill to do so himself. Second, just because Friday the 13th is ""old-school"" and not explicitly violent and gory does not give it license to suck. Hitchcock was old school, and his movies definitely inspire dread. If you want to go even more ""old-school,"" Tod Browning's Dracula has zero gore but enough atmospheric dread for twenty movies. Even Roger Corman does dread better. There was more dread in Judge Dredd.My point is, this movie is weak on almost every level, and the fact that it has been so successful leaves me scratching my head. Despite all of that, (here comes the surprise ending) I can't wait to watch part II",Friday the 13th
648,cokemanjohnny,Friday the 13th Review,10,16 May 2004,"I would like to begin by saying that this is one of the greatest films of all time, not just horror/slasher films. What Sean Cunningham did in 1980 would be impossible today: turned a tiny budget into the first of 11 films that are known worldwide. Some may argue that it was just cashing in on the success of other previous horror films, including ""The Texas Chain Saw Massare"" (1974) and ""Halloween"" (1978), but let's remember that neither of those were at all similar to Friday the 13th. Also, classics such as ""The Evil Dead"" (1981) and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984) came after it was made. Friday the 13th was completely independent, and should be required viewing for all film-making students and actors.",Friday the 13th
649,Cinebuster,A timeless horror masterpiece,10,29 June 2014,"Friday the 13th, by Sean S. Cunningham. This movie tells the story of a group of camp counselors who are stalked and murdered by an unknown woman whilst attempting to reopen the camp.Writer Victor Miller claims to have taken a crash course in horror writing when he wrote ""Friday the 13th"", as both he and Sean were in dire need of a success and saw that the horror genre had potential, but knew next-to-nothing about it. Taking ""Halloween"" as a model, Miller crafted his story about the spine-chilling night where a group of teens end up isolated and at the mercy of an unknown serial killer, with the sole purpose of making a successful horror movie. And he succeeded, as he took the many different elements that would create the ""slasher rules"" and turned the simple and derivative plot into a roller-coaster of horror, with the perfect mix of fun, horror and mystery that just keeps getting better and better until it reaches the climatic finale.The 80's were practically a golden decade for the horror genre, since the roundup of many 70's horror flicks dealt with similar plots and concepts. We had quite a few paranormal movies, like ""The Omen"" and ""The Exorcist"", and then we had mythological horror movies. Things relating to zombies, vampires and werewolves. In fact, ""Halloween"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" were two of the very few serial killer movies at the time. ""Friday The 13th"" was released in May of 1980, and eventually paved the way for many other slasher and serial killer movies like ""The Nightmare On Elm Street"" series. Since ""Friday The 13th"" was released in the summer of 1980, this was worth seeing. The filmmakers of Friday the 13th were always the first to admit just how much of the film was inspired by Halloween, like the faceless murder machine, the promiscuous teens and the prophet of doom – with Halloween it was Dr. Loomis, here it is local soothsayer, Crazy Ralph. But whereas Carpenter's film was a well-crafted movie with professional cinematography, Friday the 13th was a cheap exploitation film directed by a businessman. However, despite its technical flaws, there are many aspects to enjoy with this movie that are guaranteed to entertain. The cast are likable, especially Crosby and Bartram, who portray their characters as genuinely pleasant individuals. Morgan, too, makes her role sympathetic, with her passion for the camp evident. Whilst Bacon and Taylor are fairly generic, Nelson adds a touch of humor as the joker which would then go on to become a staple of the genre.Friday the 13th was also a landmark film for Tom Savini. He further proved his uncanny ability to get the most effect out of the least financial backing. Savini will go down in history as one of the greats in special effects - and Friday the 13th helped him prove his mastery of the art.One thing this movie handles well is pacing. It isn't too slow, it doesn't move too fast and it's not that hard to follow. It takes about twenty minutes to get to an actual murder scene, which gives the movie enough time to flesh out some characters without taking too long to add unneeded exposition or add too much than what is needed. I can only think of one scene where this is negated. The ending scene with Mrs. Voorhees rushed a little too quickly for my tastes. Not so much in the action, but in terms of the dialog and the story. I rushed itself just a bit, but that didn't ruin the scene itself. Other than that, I feel like the movie did a good job of focusing on what was really needed, while fleshing out the murder scenes in an orderly fashion. That's something that makes a horror movie very good.The dialog can be very good, very awkward or just strange. Good moments can come from the characters we don't really see too often, or the characters we only see once or twice. The trucker gives a fairly good speech on how Camp Crystal Lake is not a happy place to be, the diner waitress was very sweet and kinda nice to listen to and I feel like Alice Hardy's character reacted like any person in this situation would react. In terms of awkward and strange dialog displays, I had a very hard time understanding Steve when he was introduced. A shirtless guy with a mustache and red bandanna around his neck hitting on Hardy in the way he did might not have been the best approach in hindsight. Maybe slap on a polo shirt and then we'll see. The police officer was a little strange as well. This all might be due to this movie being a little bit dated, so we tend to look back on dialog from older movies and laugh at how strange they are. In this movie's case, the teenagers didn't really feel like regular teenagers. They had moments where they didn't quite speak or act like they were teens. Mark Nelson was probably the better example of how a sarcastic teenager would behave. Although, with this in mind, the actors themselves displayed a decent amount of emotion in their performances. The acting isn't spectacular, but they did well with the script they were given. The story is exceedingly well crafted and works greatly with the pace. While the story may be somewhat basic, it's the execution that really pays off. Not only is it well crafted, but it's overall fun to watch, and it's very pivotal to the horror genre, and without it we wouldn't have some of the greats that we are now familiar with in the horror category. There's a reason it spawned 10 sequels and a re-imagining. Overall, as long as there's a Friday the 13th, the tale of Camp Blood will always continue.",Friday the 13th
650,an_albatross,One of the Finest in the Genre.,7,19 October 2004,"To properly review a movie like ""Friday the 13th"" you have to compare it to other films in it's genre. To try to compare horror/slasher films to ""The Godfather"" or ""Citizen Kane"" you'll come up with a 1 out of 10 every time. So here goes...As far as the ""Slasher"" genre goes ""Friday the 13th"" is one of the most entertaining and innovative films of all time. It has everything fans of the genre like: Suspense, Attractive Teens, A few laughs, A bit of Campiness, a bit of Gore, and a very memorable and creepy musical score. Much like ""Halloween"", the first ""Friday"" film features one of the stronger plot lines in the series. It also spawned a whole sub genre of slasher flicks. The ""Psychopath in the Woods"" thing has been imitated time and time again since the release of this film. Where ""Halloween"" made people feel uneasy about the suburbs, ""Friday"" made the woods an uncomfortable place to be.This films also has some of the better performances in the series, mostly from the younger actors in the film. A few of the older actors' performances come of as forced and unnatural (I believe overacting is the term). The script isn't bad with a few cheesy lines here and there, but all in all it's pretty good.So, when all is said and done, this movie is quite good, one of the best in the genre. I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 when compared to other horror films. I recommend this film as well as parts II and IV of the series to moderate horror fans. The hardcore fans have already seen them all.",Friday the 13th
651,gavinjames13,Suspense in an all-time high!,10,3 November 2012,"Although I did not have a familiarity with horror movies at the time, I was indeed swept away by Friday the 13th. All the elements incorporated such as casting and plots were well thought-out. The reasons why I loved Friday the 13th so much was because the suspense was killing me in a very good way. I felt like the killer would strike at any moment. When Ned happened to wander upon the killer while walking at the lakeside, I caught a glimpse at the build of the killer and noticed how big and scary the killer looked even though you couldn't see the killer's face. Suspense was employed throughout the movie and was very effective indeed. The middle of the movie was suspenseful too as the killer really begun the killing spree at that point. The character Brenda's idea of fun seemed to be quite interesting as well. The ending was phenomenal in my opinion as the revelation of the killer slightly shocked me but nevertheless, the motive behind the killing was what spawned the many sequels that followed Friday the 13th. When the seemingly dead Jason Voorhees made his appearance in the couple of minutes in Friday the 13th, I cringed in fear and was swept away by its excellence. My personal recommendation would be that anyone who is just settling into the horror genre please watch Friday the 13th. That movie inspired me to continue to watch many other slashers such as Halloween and Slumber Party Massacre. Thanks for reading :) My rating: 10/10",Friday the 13th
652,alexeversull,"Dated, But Still Worthwhile and Entertaining",8,15 September 2013,"There are some movies that just standout and become timeless classics most consider the best the film industry can offer. This does indeed standout, and is a ""classic"" for the horror genre and those who continue to watch it even though they could reproduce the script from memory. It offers some good moments of shock, but allows the core and supporting characters to act as normal as possible, even when some are not always ""normal"". When elements of terror start to creep in, one can become more mindful and fearful, knowing that someone or something is out there and the antics of the characters we still see separates one from fear momentarily, but you know there is more to happen. It does take awhile to start up, but then increases steadily from there. It does not reveal too much and almost seems to let you want to try and guess who the killer is. Some of the end results are quite memorable, and like many movies, the music seems to make all the bit of difference. Some elements are probably dated, such as the occasional reference to classic actors/actresses and the idea of seeing a lack of now-modern technology is too much to bare for some. Either way, don't let its age get the best of you. If you're into fear and scares while coming out generally pleased with the results, give this a shot.",Friday the 13th
653,mazencheeks,Great Movie,8,9 November 2014,"For all my life I had heard about Friday The 13th, and finally decided to watch it. I researched it, and found out that Jason isn't the killer! I didn't want to watch it after finding that out, so I never watched, until a long while later when it came on TV, but I hated it. I thought it was slow and boring, and didn't deserve its praise.Then I realized that maybe it was slow because it was on TV and had commercials, and had most violence taken out, so I gave it another chance, and loved it.What a movie! I think what makes it scarier than the rest is that this one could really happen. There's no monsters or magic or zombie, its about a serial killer that could exist, much like Halloween.The characters were likable and seemed real, and I was impressed by Adrienne King's performance of Alice. It looked as if she was really in danger, and that she was really scared. It didn't look like it was acting at all, much like Alex Vincent's performance in Child's Play. I even felt sorry for Annie when she died. Everything seemed so real.This movie didn't need buckets of gore to be scary. Most of the deaths are off screen or are in a first-person point of view, which adds to the suspense, making it scary. The killer, Mrs. Voorhees, stays hidden until the very end, where she reveals that she killed everyone, and that Jason was her son. Another thing I love about this movie is the music. The ki ki ki, ma ma ma is just awesome, and adds to the suspense. And the scary fast music sounds like its from Old Yeller, but as awesome as it is, we don't care.The clichés used are just awesome, like when Annie trips over three times, and hiding in stupid places, and how sex equals death, and how the good girl lives.Overall, Friday The 13th is just a classic slasher and I'm glad I gave it a second chance. Everything is just awesome about it, and the acting is really convincing. From start to finish, this movie is awesome! 8/10, and definitely give it watch if you're a true horror fan!",Friday the 13th

I found that some parts we slept a little, but it comes just 3 or 4 minutes of bored, the rest is quite significant and also almost scary (but do not go too far either). This is not the film that makes the most fear in the world, but I have to admit that some parts were the heart beating fast enough. The murderer of the first part is quite disappointing when compared with the murderer of following components of the franchise.

Cunningham makes excellent use of the dark, isolated camp location, making it seem like a place where there is no escape, or any chance of outside help. Of course, he would not be able to do this without the help of Harry Manfredini's masterful music score, which really heightens the tension. Tom Savini's gore effects are outstanding as well, some of the best he has done.The cast, which includes a young Kevin Bacon, gives decent performances, though most of them get very little showcase before they are brutally slaughtered.
