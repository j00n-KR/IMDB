0,Leofwine_draca,I hoped for more,5,8 November 2021,"16 years after the last Hollywood version we get another MORTAL KOMBAT video game adaptation and funnily enough it's about the same quality as the last one. Grittier to begin with and Hiroyuki Sanada is one of those guys who automatically lifts the quality of the thing by his presence alone, but then it ends up turning into the usual CGI dominated cheese fest by the climax. They try to make sense of some kind of plot here which is quite excruciating but by the end it's just the usual intercutting of heavily stylised fights between the player characters. Kudos for the copious gore FX and the CGI isn't as bad as it could have been, but I was hoping for more.",Mortal Kombat
1,SnoopyStyle,B-movie reboot,6,30 April 2021,"Earth is on the verge of annihilation. After nine victories by Outworld, they are one loss away from the Earth being conquered. Cole Young (Lewis Tan), Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee), and Liu Kang (Ludi Lin) must defeat the warriors of ruthless Outworld Emperor Shang Tsung (Chin Han).This is a violent, hard-R reboot of the video game adaptation from the 90's. It has scraped off the cheese and speckled on some more action. The special effects are mostly up to date. It's very competent like the competent acting, action, and designs. The story is basic and set up to have more movies in the franchise. Josh Lawson is funny as Kano. The others are less charismatic. The missing ingredient is an A-list actor or an old action star doing a side role cameo. It's an old Hollywood trick but it works. It would give this the illusion of an A-list movie. As it stands, this is a well made B-movie and it's probably enough to continue as a B-movie franchise. Sadly, that road is usually downhill but maybe it could be a long ride.",Mortal Kombat
2,Prismark10,Mortal Kombat,5,18 June 2021,"Mortal Kombat has been rebooted as a gore laden and a more serious action packed movie.It is surprisingly entertaining but a predictable film. The director makes effective use of some visceral battle fights.It starts off in 17th Century Japan. Bi-Han/Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim) kills the ninja clan led by Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion. He kills Hanzo as well as his wife and son.Raiden, god of thunder, arrives and takes Hanzo's infant daughter to safety.In the present day. Outworld has defeated Earthrealm in nine of ten tournaments known as Mortal Kombat. If Earthrealm loses the tenth tournament, it can be conquered by Outworld.An ancient prophecy that the blood of Hanzo Hasashi will bring a new generation of Earthrealm's champions. One such person is a former MMA fighter named Cole Young (Lewis Tan.)The movie needed a bit more humour. I thought Kano (Josh Lawson) who provided some of the banter quickly became tiring.The big problem was the lack of a well known star so this really is a B movie fodder. However for a movie based on a computer game franchise, it is still one of the better ones.",Mortal Kombat
3,nogodnomasters,And they spelled it wrong,5,5 May 2021,"The film opens in 1607 Japan. Hanzo is killed by Bi-Kan who goes on to become the bad guy Sub-zero (Joe Taslim). Not to be confused with a Batman villain or the guy on ""Running Man."" Years later descendants of Hanzo and those that might have killed one have the dragon mark. They are the chosen ones of Earth who must fight in the intergalactic contest of ""Mortal Kombat"". There are three people who have the mark and a fourth (Jessica McNamee toned) who tags along. We know how she will get her mark, but they make us wait for it.There is the standard training scene. This one doesn't have a music montage. They also have certain elemental powers including an eye with a freakin' laser beam. Predictable fare. It builds character which was very secondary to the script.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Mortal Kombat
4,kosmasp,Looking Good Kombat,8,24 April 2021,"Considering the other real life action adaptations of the game ... this is quite a great movie! Now especially the first one was so ridiculous that it was kinda fun. That does not mean you will like it - but hopefully you will like this one. The action is really good (and quite violent just so you know), the acting is also more than solid, which includes script and dialog. Always considering the nature of the movie that is.This is not Shakespeare, this is not meant to have a big story. Bad guys want to destroy the Earth (realm), good guys fight to protect it ... I mean it really is simple as that. The twists and turns can be guessed or seen at least most of the time ... but the movie is entertaining nevertheless. And it looks so good ... not sure how much money they invested, but it was worth it. Yes these movies do not win best cinematography and stuff like that, but that does not mean they cannot have brilliant people as DPs. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but I really enjoyed this one and if you decide to watch this (because you like the genre and/or the games) you will not be dissapointed.",Mortal Kombat
5,classicsoncall,"""Pain is the ultimate catalyst.""",7,3 May 2021,"With a title like ""Mortal Kombat"", your expectations should border on the desire to see a fast paced film with plenty of violent martial arts action, so on that score the picture delivers. Story wise, it comes across as pretty standard and predictable, with champions of the Earthrealm battling the forces of Outworld to prevent the world from falling under the evil influence of super baddie Shang Tsung (Chin Han). One thing that took me out of the picture for a moment was when turncoat Kano (Josh Lawson) made reference to David Copperfield in 1617 Japan; where was the film's editor on that one? The picture does suffer from a handful of scenes that are too dark, never a good thing for fight scenes because it's like letting the audience know that what you're looking at couldn't occur in real life. The most gruesome scene for me was when Kung Lao (Max Huang) sliced the vampire winged Nitara (Mel Jarnson) with his bladed helmet, the visual there you don't want to contemplate too long. Over all, this is a fun and fast paced flick for fans of this stuff, but it doesn't get any deeper than that. You'll remember Kano's fireball eye laser as one of the cooler special effects.",Mortal Kombat
6,paul_haakonsen,Finally! This is how Mortal Kombat should be done...,7,23 April 2021,"Granted, I must admit that I was most certainly persuaded to watch the 2021 movie adaptation of the ""Mortal Kombat"" arcade games, despite of how less than impressive most of the previous attempts at bringing the arcade game to life on the big screen. But the special effects in this 2021 seemed to do the trick, at least in the trailer.And now that I have just watched the 2021 attempt from writers Greg Russo, Dave Callaham, Oren Uziel and Greg Russo. And color me impressed. This 2021 ""Mortal Kombat"" is how the very first ""Mortal Kombat"" movie should have been. And this particular movie from director Simon McQuoid makes you want to forget about ever having suffered from previous attempts of ""Mortal Kombat"" with the likes of Christopher Lambert and Brian Thompson on the cast lists.Sure, the storyline told in the 2021 ""Mortal Kombat"" was pretty simplistic, as they have essentially always been in these movies, as they are movies based on an arcade game. Let's face it, there isn't really much of any in-depth deeper storytelling needed here. It is fighting, pure and simple.Joe Taslim and Hiroyuki Sanada are phenomenally cast for the roles of Bi-Han/Sub-Zero and Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion respectively. And aside from these two mammoth action stars, then it was really, really refreshing to see that they opted to cast mostly unfamiliar talents for the roles in this movie. That made me very happy, because it was so good to see fresh and new faces to portray these characters, so the older and more dubious performances could be put away for good.""Mortal Kombat"" is, surprise surprise, a martial arts fighting and action movie. There isn't any profound storyline here, but of course that should come as no surprise when you sit down to watch a movie such as the 2021 ""Mortal Kombat"" movie.Visually then the special effects and CGI people working on ""Mortal Kombat"" worked wonders. The visual effects were spectacular and the CGI was spot on. These effects really made a world of difference for a movie such as this. And it was so nice to see proper effects in a ""Mortal Kombat"" movie after all these years.Sure, I haven't played ""Mortal Kombat"" for many years, so some of the characters in the storyline here in this 2021 movie were total strangers to me. Not that it really made a whole lot of difference to the overall enjoyment of the movie though.And I do enjoy how they aren't afraid to kill off characters in these movies.I will say that director Simon McQuoid managed to direct a proper movie here with this particular addition to the ""Mortal Kombat"" franchise. And this is without a doubt a movie that is well worth taking the time and effort to sit down and watch.This was a movie that properly entertained me, and I was enjoying it from beginning to end. As such, I am rating the 2021 ""Mortal Kombat"" a well-deserved seven out of ten stars. This 2021 movie is a fresh start for the ""Mortal Kombat"" movie franchise, and let's just pretend all the previous ones actually were just a fever-induced bad dream.",Mortal Kombat
7,BandSAboutMovies,I'm the audience for this,4,30 April 2021,"'ve seen so many reviews of this movie that seem to take great enjoyment making fun of it and saying things like, ""Who cares about a Mortal Kombat movie?""Well, I do. I'm the exact audience for this movie, someone who fell in love with the game, saw both of the original films in the theater and have purchased more than my fair share of the multiple sequels and all the DLC that goes with them.So while these holier than thou critics snicker their way through their reviews, please know that this is someone hoping Stryker would show up and someone that grinded to get multiple Scorpion outfits in Mortal Kombat 11.That means that when I mention all the moments why this movie didn't work, it's with sadness.That's because I've been waiting - as have many fans of the game - for this movie for a long time.And this isn't what I was waiting for.Now, there's the blood and gore that some see as the true heart of Mortal Kombat, but for me, the true joy of the games is the opportunity to be part of a wuxia movie. That would seem to be an incredibly simple idea to take and make a movie of - hey, they did it right the first time - and yet, this doesn't seem to do it.Yes, the Mortal Kombat tournament doesn't happen in every game, but the story has always revolved around it. Much like every shared universe attempt, this is a movie trying to make the sequel instead of worrying about making the first movie rock.The other critical error this movie makes is that outdated thought that we need a set of human eyes to view these events through, someone we can relate to. That would be Cole Young, a struggling MMA artist who has a family bloodline that ties to Scorpion. This is also kind of like how old comics thought that I needed a child sidekick to better identify with Batman. Nope. I'm just fine with wanting to be the hero and even better with unworldly characters that allow me to escape the world of normlacy.Speaking of the gray ordinary world, this movie seems content to have the action take place outside a farmhouse than taking us to the Outworld or really anywhere that isn't drab. Look, I'm not expecting this to be Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain, but come on. The beginning at least flirts with bright colors and great fighting. And then...That said, I kind of liked that Tadanobu Asano - Kakihara from Ichi the Killer - was Raiden, even if he doesn't get all that much to do. Josh Lawson's Kano is one of the few other bright spots, even if this version just has a red eye and isn't a cyborg. And I'm always happy to see Kabal.But you know, the first film in what may be a new series gets rid of Goro and Sub-Zero before we even get to the tournament, while tickling us with a mention of Johnny Cage. It's the inverse of Patton Oswald's joke about the Star Wars prequels - ""Don't show me how the things I love started, show me the things I love!"" - and like some weird edging thing where they withhold the sure thing in the hopes of getting you to care more about a movie that might never get made instead of the one you paid to watch.",Mortal Kombat
8,CinemaSerf,Repetitive and derivative first parter...,6,14 September 2021,"The snag with this (or ought that to be snags? Is that it is so clearly the opening gambit for a series of action films, and as such much of the initial stages are spent on rather plodding character and plot development, and frankly neither of these elements offer much promise of anything new to come. Lewis Tan take the top billing as ""Cole"" an young MMA fighter who tries to establish a fearsome band of suitably skilled champions who are going to have to join him against the evil Cryomancer and, yep - you've guessed it - save the universe... Indeed, if you have a dragon mark anywhere on your body, I'd lock all the doors and get under that duvet - else you might find yourself drafted in too! The effects are great, but not particularly special - it is an high standard that we all expect nowadays, so they don't really stand out. The dialogue is neither here nor there and the fight scenes are such as we have seen many, many times before... It's not rubbish, and perhaps now we have the establishing film out of the way, we can focus a little more on a more solid and interesting story for the characters to play out. This, however, is instantly forgettable stuff...",Mortal Kombat
9,Calicodreamin,Hell yea!,8,23 April 2021,"I actually quite enjoyed watching this movie! The action was awesome, the jokes were actually funny, and the storyline was fairly well developed.

10,bombersflyup,I don't think so!,2,26 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat (2021) has no reason to exist, as the original's already perfect.The opening sequence isn't good, but okay, on the level of mini-series. After we're introduced to the main cast, it's hardly watchable. Every character and actor vastly inferior and it's just not well done. I mean Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's irreplaceable, but they didn't even try to fill this role. I had no expectation, so I'm not disappointed, just a waste of time. I don't see how anyone could be a fan and not love the original film, yet put out something so far off it.",Mortal Kombat
11,trashgang,fight for your life,8,8 May 2021,"I don't know a thing about the game Mortal Kombat so I can't say it's okay on that part or it's total crap. Whatever. I just went as I do the last year totally blind into this one.I did like the story , did like the effects and did like the fight scene's. I can't say anything else because it's all about fighting.Maybe I'm stupid but it reminded me somehow on the Marvel or DC superhero flicks.What else can I say, martial art and a good story.Gore 0/5

12,siderite,"Better than the first movie, but less fun",8,24 April 2021,"If you are a fan of Mortal Kombat you played the original game and then every version you got your hands on until now and also watched the movies and the TV series and are curious about how this compares. Well, I am happy to say that it is a good Mortal Kombat film, balancing character development and action pretty well. However, it has to adapt to the times, meaning that the characters are inspired from multiple versions of the games and the R rating is there only to show some scenes that are inspired by the 3D fatalities in the games and less about actual emotional violence, subtlety or real violence. Also, I am afraid to say, the acting is not that good in some cases. The plot makes sense, but there are some scenes in it that don't, like people accepting Cole as the leader or him understanding what the hell Hanzo says in Japanese and the bad guys leaving their targets alive for no reason. Compared to the 1997 film, it is much better, but also less entertaining. Gone are the goofy quips of the actors, replaced with a kind of rushed intensity, like all the characters know they are in a movie and work together to hurry it along.Let's start with the characters. You get Cole Young as the main character, a good fighter, but completely unaware of the Mortal Kombat universe as well as his lineage descending directly from Scorpion. He is a completely new character, not found in the games. You get Sub Zero, he is the big baddie and working for Shang Tsung, and a bit of Scorpion. Then there is Liu Kang, can't avoid him, together with Kung Lao. And finally the (love?) triangle Sonya, Kano and Jax. Then there are the fighters for Shang Tsung: Sub-Zero, Kabal, Mileena, Nitara, Reiko and CGI Reptile and Goro. Characterization-wise, only Cole, Sonya and Kano get anything like a character arc. Jax, Liu Kang and Kung Lao follow, then the other characters getting a random basic backstory and quick demise.I am a fan of Joe Taslim since I've seen him in Fighter and he did a terrifying Sub-Zero. It was kind of funny to see him defeated by Lewis Tan and Hiroyuki Sanada, though. Josh Lawson absolutely stole the show with his interpretation of sociopathic Kano. I liked Mehcad Brooks as Jax, he really changed his appearance for the role and trained a lot. Goro was ridiculous and also kind of pointless. They wasted a lot of CGI to just kill the character off. As I said, they made a good trade off between story and action, but most of the other characters were short lived, especially the baddies. I was most disappointed with Mileena, which is one of my favourite characters and a really brutal fighter with a huge game history, but in this film she's just a little girl with anger issues. Nitara and Reiko have a few scenes and then dies off. I thought Kabal was real interesting and well played by Daniel Nelson. Sonya was also one of my favourites, especially in the early games, but I can't say I was impressed by Jessica McNamee. Also Raiden... Tadanobu Asano is a decent actor, but he was crap in this.The more interesting bit of the film for me is that it's clearly a beginning, not an end. Imagine that in the story of this film there actually wasn't any tournament! It all happens before the tournament even starts. So if this is a success, which I certainly hope, they have enough time to get the feedback from fans and adapt for the sequel(s). Personally I think that Mortal Kombat has such a deep lore that it is perfect for a TV series rather than for a bunch of films. Perhaps they will go that way, who knows. Also, the games always grouped the characters in small units: Scorpion and Sub-Zero, Sonya, Jax and Kano, Shao Kahn, Kitana and Mileena, etc. I think a really good MK movie would just take one of these subgroups of characters and expand their story as part of the larger Mortal Kombat universe. Go, MKEU!Bottom line: great acting job for Sub-Zero and Kano and a bit Kabal, great preparation for Jax, good job on balancing story and action, but the rest could have been better. Two hours is way too little for any comprehensive Mortal Kombat story. Next time either go with a TV series or with episodic films, covering just a few characters.",Mortal Kombat
13,FeastMode,sighhhhhhhhhhhhh,3,25 April 2021,"Things i liked: the opening scene was amazing. The fighting was awesome, beautifully shot, a few too many cuts but i could still see everything. And basically anything with subzero or scorpion was great. And cano was a fun and funny characterthings i hated: everything else.This movie is really bad. I got my hopes up after the first scene, but it was all downhill from there. Everything is bad. Other than subzero and scorpion, the acting is awful. Like really really bad. Every line or facial expression given by sonya blade is laughable. And the guy playing reiko had a tiny part, but every scene he was in, omg, he had the stupidest hammiest over-the-top facial expressions i've ever seen. (he played rictus erectus!? Lol)the dialogue was terrible, the story was nonsense. Pacing is bad, no flow at all. But the worst part, so much of the fighting was terrible, poorly shot, switching between different fights, and mostly unclear. Why???? Some of the fighting was awesome, so why was the rest of it so bad?They can make an amazing MK movie, i do believe that. I hope they eventually do (1 viewing, 4/24/2021)",Mortal Kombat
14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Get over here and watch this; it's dumb but fun.,6,8 August 2021,"Perhaps fittingly, 'Mortal Kombat (2021)' feels like something straight out of the nineties - it's arguably more of a direct remake of 'Mortal Kombat (1995)' than an adaptation of its source video-game franchise. It's colourful, chaotic and even a bit camp; it's silly but it knows it, emulating the feeling of playing the fighting game with friends rather than the feeling of being engaged in brutal, to-the-death bouts against vicious, otherworldly opponents. Fans of the games will find plenty of enjoyment here (don't ask me why, but hearing someone say ""fatality"" or ""flawless victory"" after a recognisable kill is oddly satisfying), even if some elements have been adapted in slightly strange - and, I suppose, 'unfaithful' - ways for no real reason. I don't mind the created character of Cole, since he serves as protagonist and does a decent job of driving the story forward, but he isn't all that interesting - nobody is, to be honest - and he doesn't really fit with the more classically adapted elements. The most engaging character is probably Kano because he chews every scene he's in; others, like Raiden and Shang Tsung, are just flat-out flat. The picture is oddly small in scope and some (not all) of its supernatural elements - such as outworld, for example - are actually rather boring, aesthetically speaking. The whole thing feels a bit inconsequential, too; although it does feature several instances of decidedly mortal combat, it doesn't actually get around to portraying its eponymous tournament. It's almost like set-up for a potential future film. While I certainly hope that film will come, it doesn't feel great to have sat through something that essentially acts as a prelude. Still, it isn't a waste of time. Despite its issues, it's actually a ton of fun. The story is essentially an excuse to get its stars involved in one-on-one bouts with one another and make references to their video-game counterparts. The action, save for a couple of odd edits (including one that literally seems like an overlooked mistake), is well-choreographed and energetic, typically making good use of its characters' varying skill sets. The players feel a tad invincible at times (until they're killed, of course), but that's sort of in keeping with the source material because the combatants just keep going until the fight is done, no matter how much potentially fatal - or, at least, incapacitating - damage they take (such as broken bones, ruptured spleens and busted testicles). The picture has its share of fatalities, most of which are recognisable to franchise fans, and it renders them in an appropriately violent way, even though the gore isn't gross so much as (as odd as it seems) crowd-pleasing. Like I said, it's fun. It definitely has its problems and, as entertaining as they are, its fights aren't the ""greatest fight scenes ever put to screen"" as its director once claimed, but the flick is fast-paced and enjoyable right the way through. It doesn't take itself too seriously and it never even comes close to being boring. Though imperfect, it's a solid effort. It's especially good for a video-game movie; in fact, it's one of the best video-game movies I've seen. 6/10.",Mortal Kombat
15,MLDinTN,better than expected,6,30 April 2021,"I was expecting absolutely no plot, but we actually get a small one. It seems it's time for the Earthrealm fighters and Outworld fighters to square off. Outworld has won 9 times in a row and if wins again will take over Earth. So not only do the fighters have to save themselves, they must also save mankind. Sub zero beings to hunt down Cole, whose ancester was Scorpion. Jax and Sonya Blade hunt him down and tell him about the Mortal Kombat tournament. Sonya has captured Kano whom has the mark of the dragon like Cole and Jax. From there, they go to the temple of Raiden to seek training and learn their secret powers. Shang Tsung tries to cheat by engaging in combat before the tournament, so all our characters end up taking each other on. We get some good fights and gore( not very realistic) but still cool. Scorpion shows up at the end and breathes fire, cool. I think you need to know something about the video game and its characters to really enjoy this movie.FINAL VERDICT: If you like the video game, I think you will like this. You can still enjoy the fights if you don't know much about the game. Worth a view.",Mortal Kombat

19,ironhorse_iv,Get over here! It's time to talk about Mortal Kombat. Is it a movie worth watching? Kinda.,6,14 May 2021,"Honestly while not a flawless victory, this fantasy martial arts adaptation of a 1990s fighting arcade game was not horrible. Like the original PG-13 1995 & 1997 movies, this 2021 reboot also adapted in and out franchise story elements. With the results being that the visuals are too extremely gory. Because of that, this flick came very close to getting an NC-17 title by the MPA. Instead, it got a Rated R rating. With that, this film's gruesomely kills are a lot more memorable than the previous movies big time. Even with all the quick cuts from director Simon McQuoid and his crew, the fights perform by the legit martial artists honestly lives up to the bloody fatalities of the game; along with the somewhat silly unnatural special effects, listenable music and semi beautiful cinematographic backdrops. However, the previous ones do establish the underground fighting tournament for control the Earthrealm a lot better by showing it. Here the movie explains the lore in a quick spill badly execution black screen text scene, follow by a repetitive exposition dump from a character with little history of witnessing the tournament, firsthand. You would think that Earth God defender Raiden (Tadanobu Asano), would be that story teller yet it's given to Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee). Nevertheless, the tournament never really does starts in this movie. This film instead establishes that sorcerer Shang Tsung (Chin Han) who has overseen the last nine victories loves to cheat by taking out the Earthrealm's champions before the fights starts. All of this doesn't make any sense; seeing how the tournament is there to stop Outworld from conquering Earth. Yet they could enter easily and freely into that world at anytime and anywhere to interfere with the God of Thunder's fighters. Honestly what's really stopping them from conquering the world all through. Another thing if Raiden could take his fighters to the endless void, a neutral world to escape the villains. I really don't get why his crew wouldn't train there until the tournament starts or the Elder Gods find out on Tsung's scheme. A lot of this film's conflict could easily be resolved with his teleporting powers. The movie never makes it clear what Raiden could and couldn't interfere with and why he couldn't just banish Tsung all right. I really got lost in the lack of logic of the plot because of him. It sucks because Asano does look the part, but he doesn't have the natural charisma or gravitas of that of the previous actor Christopher Lambert to keep me entertain to overlook the big jarring flaws of that character. This version of Raiden is also a jerk with his bemoaning and insulting attitude. Not fun to be around. The film makes it hard to believe that he cares about Earth. Another thing that the original flick has over this, was its protagonist. Instead of having original video game characters like Liu Kang (Ludi Lin) take the helm. This supernatural martial arts film written by Greg Russo and Dave Callaham goes in another direction by following a studio mandated new character Cole Young (Lewis Tan), a somewhat mediocre mixed martial arts fighter who quite dull and boring as the chosen one. It's really hard to root for Young as an underdog because how dumb and reckless the story makes the character be. It's quite stupid to rage quit and go back to his family when the threats are still happening. He pretty much put his wife and daughter in danger on purpose. Plus, he doesn't even evolve into Scorpion like the story makes it out to be. Instead, his new gain powers are kinda lame. Think of a punching bag mixed with Wing Chun wooden dummy and you got what he turns out to be. Nonetheless I kinda do understand why he has those magic based powers due to feeble Earth realm individual traits being enhance for the tournament such in the technology or cybernetic case of Mehcad Brooks' Jax's metal arms and Josh Lawson' Kano's eye. Since Cole is always in the meager defense. It made sense for him to have a literal plot armor. Still, I kinda wish he had more of a fighting spirit. The character always getting his butt beaten or having another character save him at the last minute. He made out to look so weak. That's not how you build up a hero at all. The movie would probably work better as a revenge story if they kept the establishing character Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion (Hiroyuki Sanada) as the lead. I kinda like the Edo period Jidaigeki Chanbara opening with him versus Bi-Han/Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim). Still kinda wish they establish why they were fighting with each other. Nevertheless, there was a lot of material that they could had gone with Hanzo after that fight, such as showing how he gain his demonic powers and the conflict that comes with it, like choosing to defend the Earthrealm for his daughter or join the forces of the Outworld for his soul. Sadly, that character doesn't show back up until the final few minutes of the end without much exposition. Nevertheless, it was still badass to see him fight his rival once again. Love Joe Taslim as Sub-Zero. Sorry for the pun, but he was chilling. Very menacing. As for the other antagonists. The performances needed a little work even with Lawson being somewhat a memorable comic relief as Kano. Nonetheless, I do get why the filmmakers chosen to showcase some of the lesser-known villains from the franchise. Can't have ultimate baddie Shao Kahn died in the first movie. The same with the heroes. Glad they kinda hint that other characters like Nightwolf, Johnny Cage and others might be coming soon. That would be nice to witness. Overall: While not truly toasty. This reboot still worth a watch both in theaters and on HBO Max. So, check the movie out.",Mortal Kombat
20,The-Sarkologist,A Good Way to Waste Some Time,6,16 May 2021,"I've probably played this game a couple of times in the past, but I have never really been all that interested in what I term as beat-em-ups. Then again Mortal Kombat, back in the days, or at least back in the days of the video arcade, was one of those classic games, probably because at the time of its release it was pushing the boundaries of what could be done. Also, they have released eleven versions of the game (which usually means that they have been upgraded for the next generation console), and I have to admit that they do bring in new characters. However, the characters in this movie all come from the original game.Honestly, there isn't much in this film that differs it from many of the other films that I've seen, though I guess it is certainly better than a lot of the rubbish that had been hitting our screens of late. Yeah, this is definitely not one of those straight to Netflix types of films, but it certainly isn't going to be winning any awards either (though I might eat my words down the track).The story is about these realms that engage in periodic tournaments, not that there is actually any tournament in the film, but rather people with super powers beating each other up. We have the outworld, which are the bad guys, and we have Earth, which are the good guys. Anyway, centuries ago this guy named Hanzo, who happens to be a martial arts master, got into a fight with another dude named Bi Han who has this ability to shoot ice out of his hands. Anyway, Bi-Han kills Hanzo and his family, but Hanzo's daughter manages to escape, and from her comes a line of martial artists.Fast forward to the present time we have Cole Young, a descendant of Hanzo, and also a street fighter, though he isn't particularly good any more. Unfortunately, it seems that Bi-Han, who now goes by the name of Sub-Zero, has decided that they will go and kill all of the competitors from Earth so that they win the tournament by default, and as such end up taking Earth for their own. As you can probably guess, we then have a section of the film where they are training, and then they go after the bad guys, and you can probably guess what the ending is going to be.Yeah, it was okay, what you would basically call a popcorn flick. Mind you, they do have some laughs, especially with the Australian (or who I assume is Australian based on the accent, though the accent does happen to be particularly thick). Mind you, he was a pretty cool character, and they certainly did well with the laughs. However, in the end it isn't anything that is particularly flash, but it still is an enjoyable watch, and is certainly much better than a lot of the rubbish I've seen of late.",Mortal Kombat
21,ops-52535,its for the...,5,23 April 2021,"Kids and grownups in somekinda combatmode that this film invites, not a grumpy old man. I think its far too unfinished on the special effects, it will become a comedy gem in 2050 due to bad visual motions, like monster movies made in the19 50's and 60's, watched and smiled over in 2010.Some funny acts, by a surtain aussie with beard, the rest is just pounting at eachother, or cut and slice and grind under the influence of humungous sound effects and musical score volume. Otherwise its dead on new ideas, you can sense everyones next move, and with ''two-in-one''- monsters(broadbacked and handy as metoo) , others with a ''jonas''-mask( not the friday 13th kind, its the one for coldasthma patients, skiers, skaters, parachuters etc) or tight nostrils due to icesickles in every joint and others with a shraply edged toilett bed pan on the head aint scary.So its just a weak 5 with just a small recommend, its entertainment for the multitasking generation, not for a ''count one finger at the time''-guy like miself.",Mortal Kombat
22,UniqueParticle,Brutality achieved with loads of satisfaction!,9,28 April 2021,I don't know what the deal is for a video game adaption this Mortal Kombat is the closet thing to accurate in my opinion. Got to see this in RPX which is an exhilarating theater experience glad I didn't watch on HBO it wouldn't have been as epic! I absolutely love how brutal the fights/murder scenes were. Some of my reviews don't get enough appreciation so at least take the positivity from me.,Mortal Kombat
23,paulclaassen,Now that's entertainment!,6,4 July 2021,"Based on the video game franchise, 'Mortal Kombat' has the age old premise: world domination. This high fantasy action adventure film will no doubt have a limited audience: those who enjoy fantasy movies, and those who enjoy martial arts.While I'm not a martial arts fan, I must admit the fight scenes were incredibly well done. They are fast, brutal and bloody and extremely well choreographed. There was maybe a bit too much fighting for my liking, but I nevertheless still enjoyed the movie.So, we have a bunch of unlikely heroes who must save Earth from the ruler of Outworld, the soul sucker Shang Tsung. The ultimate villain, though, is Bi-Han, or Sub-Zero. His scenes were by far the film's best scenes - especially when he first arrives on Earth in search of fighter Cole (Lewis Tan). The visual effects are jaw-dropping! The no holds barred action sequences are fast-paced and exciting. The film also has a very good score.Although Cole is the film's main protagonist, my favorite character was Kano (Josh Lawson), simply because his character was so different from all the others. He is rude, bombastic, arrogant, and has no sense of ethics, morals, or discretion.There are some plot flaws but being high fantasy they can easily be overlooked. I found 'Mortal Kombat' more entertaining than other high profile superhero movies like 'The Avengers' series and the new Spider-Man movies starring Tom Holland. 'Mortal Kombat' was pure entertainment from beginning to end. And the film ends with the door wide open for a sequel. This is a film I'll watch again and again, even if purely for the stunning visuals and amazing action sequences.",Mortal Kombat
24,Thanos_Alfie,"If you are a fan, you must watch it...",7,24 April 2021,"""Mortal Kombat"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a group of people trying to find the Earth's greatest champions in order to fight to an elite tournament. They have to do their best and work together if they want to have a chance to win.Since I had already watched the two previous movies I knew what to expect from this movie but still I was surprised by it. It was very interesting, it had amazing visual effects, and a simple but nice plot that combined very well the previous movies of the franchise. The direction which was made by Simon McQuoid, it was very good and he presented very well his main characters and their stories, something that made clear the plot of the movie. The interpretations of Lewis Tan who played as Cole Young, Josh Lawson who played as Kano, Joe Taslim who played as Bi-Han / Sub-Zero and Hiroyuki Sanada who played as Hanzo Hasashi / Scorpion were simply amazing. Something else that I have to mention is that I would want more scenes of Scorpion fighting than what I watched in this movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Mortal Kombat"" is an amazing movie that if you are a fan of ""Mortal Kombat"" I am sure that you will love it and I strongly recommend you to watch it.",Mortal Kombat
25,cruise01,Film finally reaches its victorious fatalities which may satisfy fans.,10,26 April 2021,5 out of 5 stars.Mortal Kombat is an awesome fantasy martial arts film that takes the game into a movie franchise in a hard R with its bloody violence. And taking the characters into justice with how the games were.The story takes a brand new character Cole who has a dragon symbol on his body. Which Sonya explains that there is a tournament coming. Which every contender from other realms are going to fight each other. While the earth champions may have to fight for there realm.The story felt like an origin story. Characters reaching there potential with there abilities. Them forming a group together. While Shang Tsung is trying to eliminate Earths champions to take over the realm. It almost feels like watching the games storyline coming to life.The film is action packed throughout. Lots of bloody action. Fatalities are shown which was awesome. And gory. Lots of fun characters are in the movie like Kung Lao. Liu Kang. Kano. Sonya. Kabal. Mileena. Goro. And the ultimate showdown with Sub zero and Scorpion which delivered a fantastic fight sequence.The visual effects are great. The music score was good. The film does feel short for its run time of 1 hour and 50 minutes. Characters come together. Little introduction with some. Then they spend the middle of the movie training. Then a one on one showdown and a climatic fight with Subzero and Scorpion. It is fast paced and has plenty of action to keep you entertained.The film does have a fun surprising ending hinting on a next character that will show up in a sequel which i cant wait. The film does end with plenty of ideas where a sequel can go next.,Mortal Kombat
26,eddie_baggins,"A blood-soaked and over the top affair, Mortal Kombat delivers exactly what was promised",6,26 April 2021,"You've played the games. You've seen the 90's movies and you've seen the trailers, no doubt then you know exactly what to expect when you walk into the theater (or log in at home thanks to HBO Max) to partake in some extremely over the top fisticuffs and dismembering courtesy of long-lasting property Mortal Kombat.An Australian tinged affair, with this mid-budget offering shooting in South Australia thanks to producer extraordinaire James Wan and Australian based commercial director Simon McQuoid (as well as starring the scene-stealing Josh Lawson as foulmouthed criminal Kano), this latest rebirth of Mortal Kombat is as over the top and nonsensical as you'd have imagined it to be but in a world where many video game features are nigh on unwatchable, this blood-soaked adventure stands up as a decent bout of entertainment for anyone heading into it expecting exactly what was promised.Suffering at times quite badly by the unnecessary new addition to the Mortal Kombat cannon of Lewis Tan's bland MMA fighter turned fighter of Earth Cole Young, Mortal Kombat still gets things right where it needed too thanks to some frenetic and fan service heavy fights and beloved characters, that ensure the many millions of fans across the world of this property are going to have a blast watching a collection of iconic creations go toe to toe as they face an impending threat that is often at the hands of Joe Taslim's devious Sub-Zero.Forgoing the what was to be expected tournament format that the games have become famous for, focusing too much on the films plot would cause many to feel uneasy but when the focus of the viewer can be maintained on enjoying a colorful bunch of misfits and miscreants, McQuoid's fast-moving and energetic film can be a popcorn munching good time.A stand-out amongst all the gushes of blood, the Gandalf inspired smack-downs and the training montages is what is likely to be a Hollywood calling-card performance for Australian based actor/director Josh Lawson, who absolutely steals most of Mortal Kombat's best scenes and moments.While his short temper and even shorter grasp of language that is not considered a swear word may grate a few viewers and could've been dialed back a notch or two without losing impact, Lawson as Kano provides a series of laugh out loud moments and saves an at times otherwise dull exercise that gets bogged down on more than one occasion as it heads towards a rushed feeling finale and Lawson's fun and excitable turn is a great piece of work for an industry veteran that has here finally got a chance to take hold of the spotlight.In many ways Kano can be seen as a metaphor for this film, devoid of any real substance, loud and brash but there's no denying there's enjoyable elements to a rough around the edges product that never tries to become anything its not and should be a winner for any fans with their expectations in check.Final Say -Not a film to convert any new Mortal Kombat fans, this fast, violent and empty offering is not high-class stuff but its one of the more enjoyable examples of recent video game adaptations and should be a solid stepping stone for future installments should the fans demand it.3 garden gnomes out of 5.",Mortal Kombat

28,SAMTHEBESTEST,Mortal Kombat is succumbed by weak writing but somehow finds a breath with action elements.,5,23 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat (2021) :
Movie Review -With the trailer release this film gave an idea of storyline, visuals, action and overall content so, expecting too much after that was already out of question. The only thing remained to see was whether this manages to come out as a decent product or not. Here is your answer. Call it decent or not but it's definitely not good. It battles for that Decent to Average range with the help of some good action sequences. Nevertheless, the base of weak writing does not hold the weight of narrative and as expected, it collapses. There are few action scenes here and there that can be enjoyed by the hardcore fans who doesn't care much about the storyline and other intelligent stuff so yes it touches that Decent mark after crumbling so much for 100 minutes.In film, MMA fighter Cole Young seeks out Earth's greatest champions in order to stand against the enemies of Outworld in a high stakes battle for the universe. There are many loopholes in the basic writing and the screenplay is filled of errors. It doesn't apply logic even while presenting a fictional drama and then you seriously start scratching your head. Maybe it doesn't matter sometimes, one can overlook minor faults but it cannot be accepted every time, right? Mortal Kombat goes all out just to make things go their way even though it doesn't make much sense. The overuse of cinematic Liberty seemed to have done huge damage here.With actors, there is a sort of relief. Lewis Tan, Jessica McNamee, Josh Lawson, Tadanobu Asano, Mehcad Brooks, Ludi Lin, Chin Han, Joe Taslim, Hiroyuki Sanada etc. All have done fine with their roles. Although, it doesn't include much of acting and has more of action to do, it can still be considered decent. Visual effects and Action are the two of the best things about Mortal Kombat. It looks great for 2021 time even though the story runs like 80s cinema.Mortal Kombat has that dragging nature for fans and therefore it ignores other audiences. That harmful vision plays the big villain part in pulling down the film and its impact. Unripened Simon McQuoid's crude and unropp techniques to drive the dead script can't be blamed much. He at least tried to keep the estimation as per his doctrine, besides, it's not his fault if the same isn't followed by on paper materialism. Overall, Mortal Kombat has couple of things to enjoy but it also has imperfection that mars a substantial entertainment. Strictly Average.RATING - 5/10*",Mortal Kombat
29,subxerogravity,Lives up to 88% of the hype,7,23 April 2021,"First off, just want to give a shout out to the first Mortal Kombat film. As a kid when I heard a Mortal Komabt movie was coming but it was going to be Rated PG-13, I said ""this is going to suck"", but they proved me wrong. In all fairness Mortal Kombat came out at a time when that was all we had and its only competition was Street Fighter (which did suck)This 2021 version has a lot to compete with (like Godzilla vs. Kong a few weeks prior), but its holding its ground. Its choice to make the movie Rated R this time was a definite bonus compared to the first one. I will say I liked the fact that the first movie was trying more to be a kung fu flick, while this film is in...Mortal Kombat with Justice League and the Avengers (The former it definitely wins with a fatality and a flawless victory).It's been a long time since I played a Mortal Kombat game so I'm a little behind. I don't know who Cole Young is. Is he a MMA fighter in the game? I thought it fitting that someone other than Lu Kang was the main protagonist as Mortal Kombat fits with the idea that you can make any of these fighters the main character.Plus, this was more of an ensemble anyway. Loved what they did with Sonya, Jax, Kano and Rayden (An Asian god played by an Asian, what a concept).Also loved the plot. Matches with what I know of the video game but I loved how they played around with it and the characters the played with.Not much of what I didn't like. Too slow at times but the plot itself came quickly and the action was excellent. Was expecting a kung fu flick but got more Justice League meets like Lord of the Rings (I use justice League because both movies are on HBOMax). Makes sense how it can fall into the Superhero Fantasy genre and I have no problems with that.The special effects were cool but...It felt good to yell out ""Mortal Kombat!"" in the theaters again.",Mortal Kombat
30,DarkVulcan29,The version I believe fans have been wanting to see.,10,26 April 2021,"It's nearly similar to the 1995 film of the same name, but this is not PG13, but instead a hard R. Does not hold nothing back with the violence. If that is not your thing, then you should avoid this film like the plague.Tells an interesting story, almost feeling like a video game come to life, the characters are all fun to watch, nobody is left out, I mean everybody has a chance to shine. Fight scenes are awesome and very inventive. If you're a big time gamer then Mortal Kombat won't disappoint you.",Mortal Kombat
31,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,30 April 2021,"OK... my wife is the Mortal Kombat fan of the family, and the fighting game fan of the family. So this should really be her review... because I'm just going to trash it.The problem here is plot, as in they actually tried to add in a real plot. Mortal Kombat is a fighting game. You play it to peacefully beat your friends to a bloody pulp... and that is where the fun is.But they added a plot.In Twister, the star of the show was the tornado. The plot was there to move the view from tornado to tornado. And in Back Draft, it was the same... with fire.Mortal Kombat thought it had to be deep. It thought it had to be something more than it a tournament. It thought the characters had to have more than surface level depth.THE DIDN'T.The Tournament should have been the star. The plot should have only been there to move you from fight to fight with a climax that shouted ""FATALITY!"" and left it at that.Instead they tried to add depth where no depth was needed... and that killed the fun of Mortal Kombat.Not every movie needs to have a plot and characters, some movies work best as mindless popcorn munching escapism.",Mortal Kombat
32,jadavix,Mostly underwhelming video game adaptation with a few gory moments to liven things up,5,28 April 2021,"Throughout this new version of ""Mortal Kombat"", I was often thinking the same thing: gore, despite being associated with the MK franchise since the very first (highly controversial) game, just doesn't seem to fit the mythology of this world when it is shown using live actors.To my knowledge film-makers have never successfully transplanted a video game to the big screen. Remember Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as the Mario brothers? Poor Raul Julia as M. Bison? The distinctive looks and costuming of video game characters is stretched far beyond breaking point when we see it up on the big screen. I felt like I was watching that awful adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"", which was more-or-less a children's movie, because only children could take some of these get ups seriously.And then the violence happens, jarringly as it is for characters dressed as though they are the entertainment for a children's party. The movie has surprisingly scant gore, though at least they replicated some of the fatalities from the game. Aside from that, sure, there's tonnes of typical action violence in the movie, but the fight scenes are kind of mediocre. I never felt my pulse raise, was never impressed by any choreography or stunt.I also don't really know what the movie was about. Sure, it's a bunch of people who have some weird marking ending up in the ""Outworld"", a scary place familiar to MK players where monstrous creatures such as the four-armed Goro live side-by-side with human gods like Raiden and the evil Shang Tsung. Why did they go there? There was talk of a ""tournament"" which could have been a great centre-piece for the movie, but I don't remember such a thing ever taking place. It was more like the good guys were paired with the bad guys and then fought to a gory death in the Outworld and not. I don't remember any tournament setting, nor any on-screen audience to the fights.Before I go I will note that the two best actors in the movie, Australians Angus Sampson and Damon Herriman, both only ""appear"" as voice actors to Goro and Kabal, respectively. Did they do it as a favour?",Mortal Kombat
33,stevendbeard,Bloody Good Reboot,8,24 April 2021,"I saw ""Mortal Kombat"", starring Lewis Tan-Into the Badlands_tv, Deadpool 2; Jessica McNamee-The Meg, The Vow; Josh Lawson-Bombshell, Anchorman 2:The Legend Continues; Joe Taslim-Star Trek Beyond, Fast & Furious 6 and Hiroyuki Sanada-Avengers:Endgame, The Wolverine.This is literally a bloody good reboot of the 1990's movies-that are based on a video game-about a contest of fighters from 2 different realms. Outworld is home of the bad guys that want to take over Earthrealm-the good guys-and the bad guys have won the last 9 times, so one more win and they get all the goodies. Lewis plays a MMA fighter on Earthrealm that has a strange dragon tattoo on his chest-he claims it's a birthmark-that actually marks him as a contestant and connects him to Hiroyuki, aka Scorpion. Jessica plays Sonya and Josh is Kano, both of whom, along with Lewis, are also future contestants that are all being hunted down by Joe-Sub Zero-in a preemptive move to eliminate competitors before the actual contest even takes place. That's right, none of these fights in the movie take place in the big talked about contest-I'm sure they are saving that for the next movie-but they are great fights. This is rated ""R"" so they are very violent and bloody so be forewarned-don't take the little kids with you. As far as humor goes, Josh has the best lines throughout and the iconic Mortal Kombat theme is heard but it's not until about an hour and a half into the movie. There is a hint at the end about the next movie and a search for a character from the original movies-with the initials JC.It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes.I loved this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",Mortal Kombat

35,kevin_robbins,This is a movie you have to rate based on entertainment value over quality,7,30 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat (2021) is a movie the Mrs. And I saw in IMAX last weekend. The storyline focuses on an intergalactic fight tournament someone from Earth is prophesied to win; due to this, a group is sent to kill the Earth realm participants before the tournament ever begins. This movie is directed by Australian director Simon McQuoid in his directorial debut and stars Lewis Tan (Deadpool 2), Jessica McNamee (The Meg), Josh Lawson (Anchorman), Mehcad Brooks (True Blood) and Hiroyuki Sanada (Twilight Samurai - outstanding movie, BTW). I'm posting this review after the dust settled on this movie a little. This is a movie with a mediocre storyline, inconsistent acting and casting, and an uneven script...but it's a video game movie, what did you expect? However, the special effects, fight scenes and gore were all absolutely awesome. It's impossible to not like Kano, Sonya Blade, Kung Lao, Sub-zero and Scorpion in this movie. Liu Kang and Raiden were poorly cast and written, and I didn't love the main character, but I did enjoy the full circle his character evolved into. I felt some of the fight scenes at the end were too short (once everyone discovers their powers) and the movie could have been a little longer to extend those fight scenes as that's what we paid to see (and was the best part of the movie). This is a movie you have to rate based on entertainment value over quality and I'd score this a solid 7/10 and strongly recommend seeing it. I'm actually excited to go back and watch the old films after seeing this and can't wait for the sequels.",Mortal Kombat
36,drqshadow-reviews,"The Gore Arrives As-Advertised. So, Unfortunately, Does the Story.",4,3 May 2021,"Well, the first trailer looked miserable and the second was, at least, slightly reassuring. Which one lands closest to the truth? I think you probably know the answer already.The latest MK has blood n' guts aplenty, with a few especially memorable (and gratuitously gory) fatalities up its sleeve. It features a strong range of characters from various iterations of the game, well-outfitted like an expensive troupe of cosplayers. The special effects are good enough, and the martial arts action is... ehhh, I'll be generous and call it ""not bad."" As for the rest? Totally forgettable. It can't decide what it wants to be, or where it wants to go, which makes all its gathered sound and fury rather insignificant. Bottom line, the whole thing seems to exist solely for the sake of being edgy and looking cool, and often it doesn't even accomplish that much.Great time and effort is spent establishing a no-holds-barred underground tournament, one which shall determine the fate of all reality, or something, and then everyone just decides to drop the whole tournament thing and fight each other on the side instead. Scenery shifts are sudden, frequent, and only occasionally explained. Supporting characters come and go at their leisure, sans pomp and circumstance, which saps power from the aforementioned cool-guy moments the film should be chasing. Goro, the four-armed behemoth, is neither explained nor developed. Barely identified, he pops into one shot as an unseen extra, gathers recs from all the bad guys, then disappears until it's time to fight. ""Oh, hey Goro. Nice to see you. Well, catch ya later.""Maybe not to that same degree, but the rest of the cast is similarly under-explored, save the Australian mouthpiece Kano, who steals all the good lines and enjoys one of the few truly complete character arcs. Where everyone else looks stiff and uncomfortable in their fighting gear, stumbling over the stilted dialog and gaping ineffectually at the computer-generated imagery, Josh Lawson is perfectly loose and authentic in that role. He's pretty much the sole reason to even bother with this, and even then, you'd be better-served by short clips and compilations. An obvious franchise-building exercise that draws curtains over the dreaded ""to be continued"" card, it's barely half a film unto itself. A frantically loud and showy half-story, maybe, but not one I'm itching to see continued.",Mortal Kombat
37,alindsay-al,An Average Film that won't bring in new fans,5,6 May 2021,"Finally, after a long wait Mortal Kombat has made its way to The UK and today I watched it and here is my review. The premise of the film sees a group of warriors brought together to help defend Earthrealm for the evil Outworld.Main Character
There was much controversy when it was revealed that Lewis Tan would be playing an original character Cole Young and unfortunately this is one of the most boring protagonists you will ever see. In a world full of over the top colourful characters he is is just a normal guy and Tan plays it so stoically that he feels really out of place. The other issue is that the writing for his character is really poor, the film does nothing to make you care and literally gives him the most basic motivation to get involved and it really doesn't help him.Supporting Characters
Like the game it is based on, this film has plenty of characters in it so I am going to try and keep this section quite short. Firstly we have Joe Taslim as Sub-zero and Hiroyuki Sanada as Scorpion and these two are great. The film really does a good job in showing the rivalry between these two characters and how personal that it was and despite their characters not being in the forefront they are maybe the most interesting part of the film. But the show stealer has to be Josh Lawson as Kano, this is one of the funniest characters I have seen in a long time, he had one liner after one liner and it easily made Kano the best character in this film. Lawson is clearly having a blast in the role and he really adds some necessary humour into a film that is pretty serious otherwise. Mehcad Brooks as Jax and Jessica McNamee as Sonya Blade are fun aspects of the film and it does feel like they fit the characters that we have seen from the games. There are some interesting things done with their characters and stories but that doesn't change the fact I liked their characters. But there are a few characters here that I thought didn't work, Ludi Lin as Liu Kang was one of those and that was mainly because of he didn't have a character. He felt like an exposition tool and I just felt like the actor didn't quite fit the role and was relegated from being the huge character that he is in the previous films and the games. Then there is Lord Raiden and Shang Tsung, two of the biggest characters in the video games and they are portrayed fine, it's just they do very little and have next to no characterisation and it feels like a bit of a let down, to both fans who love the characters and casuals who have no idea who they are.Story
The story is okay, it is fun to watch these characters come together and clash in interesting battles with some interesting interactions. The Scorpion and Sub-Zero is the highlight and I wish there had been a bit more of it but there is no denying it is pretty captivating stuff. But this film goes against so much lore from the games it is unreal and it really affects the characters and how they get involved. Plus despite this film being called Mortal Kombat there is a lack of tournament and it just ends up feeling like build up to a sequel we actually want to see.Script
The script is also okay, the humour only really works when it is Kano, he had me laughing consistently in the film but I do think some of that was Lawson adlibbing because he is clearly a funny guy. There is also some decent emotion from the Scorpion and Sub-zero conflict but not much else.Style
The best thing about the style is that fatalities are here and they are here in all their awesome glory. Some taken literally out of the games and it is amazing to see these things that have just been in the games in a film version. The fight scenes are also pretty decent again with the Scorpion vs Sub-Zero fights being the best of the lot, with a few being a bit weaker then others. But the issue is the pacing, this film isn't particularly long and it has so many characters. If you are a fan of the lore then you know who these characters are and it feels like the film expects everybody to know who they are and it makes the film feel lighting quick without the substance required because it has just so many characters.Overall
Overall, Mortal Kombat is a pretty average film. It has some good action and characters. But some iconic characters are misused and the lead character is incredibly boring and if you aren't a fan of the franchise this isn't going to exactly bring you in. But as I am a fan of the franchise I think there are some elements of the film that could lead to some exciting things in sequels that will probably come.",Mortal Kombat

AWESOME film.,8,25 July 2021,"I grew up in the 90's & loved those Fighting Games of that time such as STREETS OF RAGE, STREET FIGHTER & MORTAL KOMBAT, i also loved the fun & cheesy computer games based movies that came out such as Van Damme's Street Fighter, Super Mario Bros, Double Dragon & of Course MORTAL KOMBAT. Those films were pure 90's fun in every way & i have a fondness & big Nostalgic love for those films even if many hate them.Now I'm a fan of 90's MORTAL KOMBAT the movie & still think it's an Awesome fantasy martial arts film but what this new Reboot did was give us all that retro feel with its score, Amazing production design & sets & fantastic costumes but also gives us that bloody action we always wanted as young teens!!!Here the blood flows & it's glorious to watch during those brutal fight scenes that are Amazing.The whole cast is Excellent here & the villains are actually scary especially SUB-ZERO, this guy is scarily savage & like an unstoppable killing machine. All the characters they have in this movie (not all of them because others are set up for future sequels) are given a decent amount of screen time shared out well except for the Awesome REPTILE, he's got a brief fight sequence in full REPTILE form & he looks fantastic as that lizard but i didn't get to see him as his cool Ninja look. Raiden looks Amazing & is the master of the good realm & the huge scary four armed monster Grogu looks Amazing here!!!! Mehcad Brooks as Jax is a scene stealer here & gives a great performance.A real top cast all performed perfectly in my opinion.I loved that old school sense of wonder & fantasy & that there's other worlds out there & dimensions with creatures & warriors wanting to fight, so exciting.The story is so well Told & doesn't feel corny or cheesy at all & is full of adventure & fantasy.Scorpion looks Amazing & has an epic fight with Sub-zero.The Mythology is here & there's so much more story to tell here & content for a whole franchise with sequels & spin-off films, i just hope this is the start of something beautiful because this movie is Excellent.",Mortal Kombat

43,masonfisk,WHAT'S NEXT MAMET PENS A PACMAN FILM...?,1,4 May 2021,"The 2021 reboot of the 1995 infamously, famous classic derived from a popular video game where fighters pit themselves in battles to the death. Not much say to here in terms of plot since it's basically good guys versus bad guys in a hand to hand fight where the loser gets deliciously killed in gore soaked ways which would make the Marquis de Sade wince but trying to elevate the narrative from its predecessors, we get backstory on how Scorpion became Scorpion, certain characters met others, all in the name of an upcoming tournament where the combatants will meet but since this is part of a projected 5 picture series (so a youtuber claims) we never get to the legitimate showdown since the bad guys play spoilers hoping to off their counterparts before the big tourney. I have to admit this particular story didn't interest me (it didn't interest me either in 1995 but like a loyal lemming I followed the crowds to watch it regardless) but I still rather like Paul W. S. Anderson's take on the material (he knew it was cheese) so this maturation comes off as successfully as a gussied up swine in a tux (the smell of bad pork still lingers), while good actors like Mehcad Brooks (from Supergirl), Joe Taslim (from Warrior & The Raid) & Hiroyuki Sanada (from The Wolverine) have to deliver finishing moves & corny catch phrases w/straight gobs on.",Mortal Kombat
44,questl-18592,MK Ultra,6,29 April 2021,"Another Mortal Kombat movie and I'm starting to think they should stop making these things. MK has a story, it has fascinating characters, but these just never seem to translate properly to film. Maybe that's because this is all based on a fighting game who's world is freaking bonkers and was only designed to explain the crazy characters and their bloody finishers.To a point, I actually enjoyed this as a dumb action movie with sometimes solid special effects but I can't help but wonder how much this thing got messed up by COVID-19 because it feels about 80% finished and that last bit is really, really noticeable sometimes. It's just missing that last bit of polish on the effects to make them sing. It's missing maybe an extra week or so with the choreographers to get all the fights spot on.It's also a bit too self involved for it's own good. No one in the real world ever uses the word ""fatality"" unless they're talking about Mortal Kombat, so getting characters in the movie that have never heard of this thing before spouting it off sounds weird as hell and entirely forced. Scorpion has become such a huge icon for the game as well that they can't just have him be the hellish assassin, no he needs a redemption arc and a backstory and... Just stop! Just let him be Scorpion and let him kick ass. This whole Scorpion v Sub-Zero thing the movie is forcing so hard feels like exactly that, forced and that's not great.Overall, yeah, it's not a bad action flick for those with HBO MAX to check out, but I don't think anyone needs to pay for early access to this thing. It's a nearly complete action flick with some cool effects and some not so cool ones and a meh story. It's too inconsistent to be great or really strongly tell people to seek out.",Mortal Kombat
45,aidanratesmovies,"Can't Wait for them to Get Rid of Cole Young, Otherwise it was great :)",8,28 April 2021,"It's an entertaining and incredibly shot blockbuster stravaganza- and although it doesn't hit all of its notes quite as well as it could have, Mortal Kombat is certainly the action packed and bloody spectacle one could hope for. As I suspected before seeing the film, the films main issue is its introduction of character Cole Young (played by Lewis Tan). Not only is his character incredibly out of nowhere, considering he is not a part of any of the games the film is based upon, but his character is incredibly predictable and 1-dimensional- something we have truly seen over a dozen times before. Tan gives the character his best, but he isn't enough to save the character from mediocrity, or his ugly power up. The CGI on the eyes of Shang Tsung was also incredibly obvious and very frustrating to look at. The film follows a bit of a standard story, which I honestly expected, but it does manage to be rather entertaining nevertheless. Although the film is obviously not perfect, there were quite a few things I loved about the film in general, being such a big fan of the games myself. Hiroyuki Sanada as Scorpion/Hanzo Hasashi is absolutely brilliant, the best casting in the film by far, as well as Joe Taslim as Sub Zero, Josh Lawson as Kano, and Mehcad Brooks as Jax Briggs. The CGI, besides Tsung's eyes, is absolutely incredible and does a wonderful job at mixing real shots and CGI for an incredible and nostalgic blast of action that at times truly blew me away. The fight scenes are incredibly well done, especially with Scorpion (obviously), and the pacing of the film is just right. In the end, Mortal Kombat may be flawed, but it's a very fun reboot that I hope will be expanded upon in the future.My Rating: 8/10.",Mortal Kombat
46,masonsaul,Fun mixed bag,6,24 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat is an extremely inconsistent film but overall it's a fun mixed bag. It's simultaneously really faithful to its source material and extremely inaccurate, adding new plot points and ideas that are ridiculously dumb (birthmarks that transfer to the murderer and characters unlocking their secret power with lazy explanations).Lewis Tan is a pretty wooden lead but gets better and more charismatic as it goes along. Hiroyuki Sanada, Joe Taslim and Mehcad Brooks are all perfect and Josh Lawson is a hilarious scene stealer. Ludi Lin, Max Huang and Jessica McNamee are really good. However, Tadanobu Asano and Chin Han are both bland and forgettable.Simon McQuoid's direction is mostly really good. It looks stunning in moments and has some impressive fight scenes (mainly the opening and ending fight sequences) but some of the other fights scenes are extremely choppy and borderline incomprehensible. It's fast paced but does feel rushed. The music by Benjamin Wallfisch is great. It's pretty violent and satisfyingly gory but nowhere near as gory as it's video game or animated movie counterparts.Also, where are the Elder Gods during all this?! Shang Tsung breaks the rules of Mortal Kombat and tries to kill the fighters beforehand and Raiden does barely anything about it, even the 1995 film (which is actually better surprisingly) acknowledged this. Kung Lao's death is cheap and pathetic and I hate it.",Mortal Kombat
47,nancyldraper,"Nothing special, just fan bait",5,14 September 2021,"As someone who parachuted in (not a Mortal Kombat gamer, haven't seen the other films) there wasn't much to take from this. I see it may have some fan appeal but it lacked a good storyline, fights were nothing special and no depth to any of the characters, so no heart. I rate this film a 5 (meh) out of 10. {Action Game Concept}",Mortal Kombat
48,Foutainoflife,Perfect? No. Fun? ABSOLUTELY!,8,24 April 2021,"While the '95 film will always be a staple of my teen years, I am pleased with the justice this release has done for the franchise.For me, this offered the blood, characters and the story I was eager to see. I like our introduction to Cole Young. I am going to be eagerly awaiting the sequel.",Mortal Kombat
49,Abdulxoxo,Had issues but entertaining for sure,7,6 June 2021,"This film started off brilliantly. Set centuries ago we see the origin story for the rivalry between Sub-Zero/Bi-Han and Scorpian/Hanzo Hasashi. The cinematography looked great; the storytelling felt like it had substance; and the action sequences were brutal. Taslim and Hasashi were fantastic. Then we cut to modern day and meet Cole, a brand new character created for this movie. Unfortunately he's a bland character; and Tan's performance throughout the majority of the film felt wooden. Luckily, he gets to surround himself with popular characters from the games and previous films. Sonya and Jax are decent enough characters, but slightly under-developed. Later they join up with Liu Kang and Kung Lao. Those guys are terribly written either. The only character that brought any sort of personality was Kano, who gets dragged along with our protagonists and absolutely steals this movie. Bringing humour to the proceedings. Narratively I've got mixed feelings. You might expect that one of the major aspects of a Mortal Kombat movie would be the main tournament. Well, that isn't the case for this movie. This film is more like a prequel that takes place before the film that actually deserves to be titled 'Mortal Kombat'. In a way it's good that it tries something different; but the structure of the fights would have been great within a tournament setting. The majority of the film feels tonally off when compared to that amazing opening act, which is somewhat disappointing. Overall, There's no denying that this 'Mortal Kombat' has some major issues - some of the editing, characters etc but it was a very entertaining movie and hope that for the sequel it expands upon what they did well and improves on the things they did less well. Hopefully a bigger budget and perhaps some different writers could fix those issues.",Mortal Kombat
50,arungeorge13,"Definitely not a winner, but I'd still like to see a sequel! [+53%]",5,23 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat begins with a lot of promise, taking us directly into the legendary rivalry between Hanzo Hasashi (a.k.a Scorpion, played by Hiroyuki Sanada) and Bi-Han (a.k.a Sub-Zero, played by Joe Taslim). This particular 13-minute stretch won me over for its well-choreographed (gory) action, visual texture & CGI, and revenge plot setup. Thereafter, it quickly shifts to an altogether new character Cole Young (Lewis Tan). Did we really need a completely new character for audiences to understand the campy, self-aware nature of Mortal Kombat? I'd suggest they watch the 1995 flick or play one of the games instead. Also, the emotional equation between MMA fighter Cole Young and his family is underdeveloped; so it doesn't exactly help.The editing, I felt, was all over the place. We jumped from realm to realm so abruptly, and some of the set-pieces (in the film's midsection) felt running out of breath. They either end too soon, probably in the attempt to shorten the run-time or fail to visually impress (due to excessive CGI - the Goro set-piece is a good example!). This isn't the film where you'll witness Joe Taslim's skills in all their glory, but whenever Sub-Zero shows up, Mortal Kombat gets more interesting. The plot, as you'd expect, is all over the place - sometimes in a hurry to introduce new characters only to dispose of them minutes later (Reiko, Nitara, Reptile, Kabal, and more).I'd have preferred Reptile to be a ninja-reptile-hybrid like the one in Paul W. S Anderson's film instead of the pure CGI creature we see in this one. The sequences that involve excessive CGI are some of the least engrossing ones, visually. Liu Kang is a supporting character here, and probably one of my least favourites in the film. In fact, the same goes for Lord Raiden, Jax, Shang Tsung, Mileena, and Kung Lao (though his costume was on point) - all forgettable. Australian actor Josh Lawson injects some much-needed energy into Kano with his quirky lines and is also pivotal in driving the story forward.I didn't particularly fancy or dislike Jessica McNamee's portrayal of Sonya Blade. The writing didn't render her particularly memorable. The musical score here is okayish, not particularly striking. One can't help but recall the epic techno-laced soundtrack of the 1995 flick. Along with the two incredible showdowns between Scorpion and Sub Zero, the other high point in Mortal Kombat for me were the little easter eggs that hinted at the future (Shao Kahn's statue, Nightwolf's clipping, and more) and also, the numerous video-game references (Dayum, those fatalities!). Johnny Cage in the sequel? I might take a liking to that!",Mortal Kombat

54,jeremycrimsonfox,"Not A Flawless Victory, But Still Good",8,16 July 2021,"The 2021 Mortal Kombat reboot was talked about a lot, especially when it was announced that unlike the 1995 film of the same name and its 1997 sequel, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, this would be R rated and the Fatalities that the games this movie was based on would finally be on the big screen.Cole Young is a washed up MMA fighter who fights in dangerous underground matches just to get money to put food on the table for his wife and daughter. However, his life would change when he is attacked by Sub-Zero, a cryromancer who one of Shang Tsung's warriors tasked with eliminating so there can be no tenth tournament because of a prophecy Shang Tsung fears could spell defeat, especially when Outworld is one victory away from claiming Earthrealm. After being saved by Jackson Briggs, a.k.a. Jax, a Special Forces Major, Cole gets his family to safety and leaves to find Sonya Blade, and after the two are attack by Syzoth, only to be saved by Kano, who was held by Sonya after he killed a champion, Cole soon experiences an adventure where he meets allies and learns about his arcana and heritage.This is actually a good reboot. With the R rating, fans finally get the Mortal Kombat movie that should be: as gory as the video games. Classic Fatalities are present and all their gory glory, The characters range from fan favorites like Liu Kang and Sonya to the obscure characters Reiko and Nitara. Cole Young, the protagonist of this film, is a new character created for this movie, and he is pretty much a sort of Gary Stu, especially when he is written to be descended from a classic Mortal Kombat character (plus his arcana is basically turning a strength band his daughter made him into armor that can absorb blows and either power his attacks or form into bladed tonfas, which is a lame power compared to the others). Also, some characters seem to be portrayed differently (Reiko, despite being a general of Outworld, acts like a savage, and Kano lacks his iconic cybernetic eye, as his eye laser is instead treated as his arcana). However, despite not getting a flawless victory in my book, it is still a good movie (they got some good actors (like Jessica McNamee as Sonya Blade), and the special effects is good (I am starting to like this movie's Goro, who looks more believable than the one from the 1995 film).

57,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Another example of a video game adaptation done correctly.,9,20 August 2021,"In the last few years, it feels like Hollywood has finally come to grips with adapting video games into movies. There has been such a sour taste from the initial wave of video game-inspired movies from the mid-90s that it's taken 25 years to finally delve into this genre again. As these movie franchises are being rebooted, it's nice to see that the writers and directors (mostly) understand the appeal of the source material and can translate it to the big screen. It also helps that CGI technology has advanced to the point where the special effects in these films aren't nearly as campy.While the original movie version of Mortal Kombat (1995) was OK, there were definitely a few odd choices in its production (inducing casting and some script issues). For the reboot, I felt Mortal Kombat (2021) nailed the aesthetic and the characters with just enough plot to make the reason for these brutal fights plausible. There were just enough classic characters to draw in the nostalgia factor while also providing lesser-known newer characters from the series that added a ""cool factor"" that makes me want to try some of the more recent installments of the video game franchise. Of course, there has likely been over 20 years of lore to draw from to help make a violent fighting game into something that makes sense.Those of us who grew up in the era of this video game can appreciate that the movie's staples are intact, even if they are references that heavily wink at the audience. Catchphrases and extremely brutal fatalities were sprinkled throughout and somewhat distracted from the overall flow, even if they were necessary to tie to the original games. In the end, though, Mortal Kombat was a fun ride and an entertaining bit of nostalgia that was improved by ""better graphics"" of today's CGI.Another example of a video game adaptation done correctly, I give Mortal Kombat 4.5 stars out of 5.",Mortal Kombat

60,Vivekmaru45,Of the three Mortal Kombat movies made this is the worst.,3,26 April 2021,"The first one starring Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Sheng Tsung was the best. Effects and fighting wise it was also the best. It was the first one to feature Scorpion battling Johnny Cage. In the movie the Earth realm fighters have no super-powers and have to rely on their fighting abilities to triumph over their enemies.This is not the case in this movie. The heroes do have unique special abilities. This movie is heavily C. G. I. Reliant for all the special effects which is a normal think these days, because computer dependence have made Hollywood forget the lost art of camera trickery and real effects using props. Just to quote an example James Cameron used cotton wool over a bulb to simulate a nuclear explosion at the end of his movie Aliens. It's also there in the directors commentary. This is pure genius and the effect looks gorgeous as well.The casting of the movie is surprisingly above average. The actors fit well into their roles. The sound-effects and photography is also decent.The problem is in Mortal Kombat the plot is so well known and generic that If you've ever played the game, you know how the movie is going to end.Brief plot of the film: at the core it is a family feud between the Shirai Ryu ninja clan and the Lin Kuei clan. The key figures in the movie are
Hanzo Hasashi(Scorpion) and Bi-Han of the Lin Kuei(Sub-Zero). This film is the backstory of Scorpions character as well.The other concerns the taking over of Earth realm by evil sorcerer Sheng Tsung(played by the excellent actor Chin Han) and his group of evil fighters. A tournament called Mortal Kombat is held during a specified time where the light(good) and evil(Sheng Tsung and Co.) battle it out - winner takes all.In the movie the good heroes are yet to be found and trained and have yet to discover their unique special abilities. This is the bulk of the movie. I don't know how to classify a film like this. It is not a martial arts movie. It's a dark fantasy fighting action thriller with horror overtones. And even this is not a good definition(laughs).Do I recommend this movie? I you've time to waste, it's a good movie but you'll never see it twice.

65,kuarinofu,Ups and downs,5,25 April 2021,"Growing up playing MKII and III I can't say I love this as much as I could.One has to understand that there are not that many options when it comes to Mortal Kombat in general. The story isn't really a story, just pieces of lore here and there. Maybe I'm not familiar with the whole story since I'm sure many things have happened in the most recent games.They make sure to introduce most of the characters, but they dive into that Resident Evil Alice formula. I haven't played the games past MKIII Ultimate, but I did recognize most of the iconic characters besides the main champion. He wasn't a good protagonist and his connection to the story was kinda loose.The film is very uneven. The first segment (around 10 mins) is absolutely great. Then the film starts jumping around completely changing the tone. I understand that Mortal Kombat is not meant to be taken very seriously, but I'd still prefer better continuity and overall pacing of the film. I don't think it will attract audiences that are completely unaware of the background, but if it does - they will be confused.Did it say it was uneven? Well, it shows in everything. Some of the scenes are interesting, some are not. Some of the fight scenes are creative, some are shot with so many cuts in the dark you can't really tell what is going on. The CGI was fine though, and the amount of blood and gore was satisfying.The not-so-engaging story is not made better by most of the acting performances. The actor who played Kano completely stole the show. Big props to Hiroyuki Sanada as well. I couldn't spot real acting by the main lead and the actress who played Sonya Blade though. Jackson Briggs was fine but surprisingly enough, he lacked the charisma of Lynn Red Williams from the 1997's sequel.They provide enough fan service and some jokes are even funny, but overall, besides Kano and great gore, there are not that many memorable things about it.Give it a look if you love MK, but you probably won't find it being much better than the original films from the 90ties.",Mortal Kombat

There was gore there and there that made the end of some fight scene good and surprising.Also, Hanzo/Scorpio and Sub-Zero were the best characters. Both were badass with their masks and scary blue eyes. I liked the Darth Vader feeling whenever Sub-Zero was in the scene.Since I'm not a Mortal Kombat guy, I did not know much about the universe. The story in the movie was very generic and predictable and boring. I pretty much knew how this movie would turn out. This is probably because they were setting up for a sequel.Except for Scorpio and Sub-Zero, the rest of the characters, including the main protagonist, were cheesy and boring. The acting and dialogues were also pretty bad and cringe.Even though I said that there were gore in the fight scenes, the fights themselves were disappointing with many cuts. They didn't look clean and weren't exciting.Overall, besides being surprised at the gore, I found this movie mostly boring and disappointing. 5.5/10.",Mortal Kombat
67,Neptune165,One of the most boring action movies of all time,3,7 June 2021,"Liu Kang was suppose to be the strongest fighter in mortal Kombat but this movie made him into one of the weakest fighters it's pathetic. I kept waiting for the tournament to start and then the movie ended. Coles daughter was more like a sister, and yes his armor looked like he went to party city!! Honestly at first I thought Cole's wife was his mother until they kissed because his daughter and him looked like brothers and sisters, I literally didn't realize that was even his daughter until halfway through the movie. An embarrassment to the franchise. Other than the fights and some of the humour especially from Kano, this film is complete crap for me. This movie sucked. Kano was too friendly. The cinematography sucked, they couldn't figure out how to frame a shot. The story was poorly planned out, it was just random and incoherent. It didn't even feel like Mortal Kombat until the Hanzo Hasashi fight. They didn't give Goro what he deserved. He didn't even kill anyone, he didn't even make Cole bleed! He dies in less than 3 minutes... against someone who cant even win a cage fight with a regular person.",Mortal Kombat
68,Darkside-Reviewer,A huge let down,4,7 July 2021,Mortal Kombat (2021) is by far one of the worst video game movie adaptations I have seen in the past twenty five years.The film spends far too much time introducing popular MK characters that have already been well established and given a proper back story in the video games. This is a MK movie for crying out loud the MK franchise has been going since the early 90s anyone watching this movie already knows who Scorpion and Sub Zero are they are the two most popular characters in the franchise.Many of the characters iconic powers are made completely pointless in this movie. There's a particular scene in the movie where Sub Zero uses his ice powers to bombard his targets with icecles but none of them are sharp or even vaguely poiny he essentially throws icy slush at them injuring nobody not even the defenceless civilians. Liu Kang uses fireball attack a handful of times throughout the movie and like Sub Zeros ice power he harms literally no-one with it not even when he hits Kano in the face with it instead Kano just shrugs it off like it's nothing.There are a couple of fatalities in the movie that are somewhat decent and bloody but unfortunately they only take place during the last twenty minutes of the movie and are just fatalities from the game nothing new or exciting. All the special effects in this movie including the blood are all just CGI special effects with almost no practical effects outside of set designs which still look cheaply made. The Prince Goro character is entirely CGI and in my opinion looks even faker than in the 95 MK movie and that was just a rubber animatronic with stop motion special effects. Goro looks more like one of the CGI orcs from the live action World of Warcraft movie only with worse CGI.The costumes look worse than in the 90s MK movies and look more like costumes used in a fan made MK movie not a modern high budget movie. I personally wouldn't use any of these costumes in MK 11 unless I wanted my character roster to look more like their rejected character concept art.The films soundtrack is atrocious and lacks any energy to it which is a shame because the 90s MK movies had such kick ass sound tracks that got your blood pumping during fight sequences. The iconic Mortal Kombat theme is used for five seconds during the movies climax and is played over the ending credits. The MK theme in this film is just another crappy modern day techno remix with no bass to it.The movie teases a sequel or to be more accurate the entire movie is one long teaser trailer for the next movie which judging by this crap will be about as entertaining as watching paint dry.If your a Mortal Kombat fan try and avoid this movie if you can because it will only leave you feeling disappointed and angry that even after over twenty years they still can't even put together a half decent MK movie.,Mortal Kombat
69,djurrepower,it's getting there,5,1 May 2021,"With the R rating it's getting much better. But even this movie suffers from some terrible writing. Character motivation and devolopment is rushed and watered down. Acting is sub par, but passable. But the choreography is top notch, just some amazing fighting scenes.Most ""quotes"" felt really forced, and could have been implemented better. Also, with the MK roster being this big, a lot of characters just felt like filler. But as a kano fan, I did get the better fanservice. But apart from personal bias, this movie sure got more of a gimmick feel when it comes to how well it's trying to implement the MK universe.So overall a sup par movie that still has a lot of room for improvement, but not half bad.5/10: yeeye.",Mortal Kombat
70,msbreviews,Mortal Kombat will leave most hardcore fans of the franchise quite satisfied.,6,24 April 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Even though I consider myself somewhat of a gamer, I was never the biggest fan of the Mortal Kombat games, probably because I never really knew how to play them. Besides occasional visits to my neighbor's house to play several games on his PlayStation 1 (or 2?), I've only played this game on the nostalgic arcade machines that gave me incredible joy when I was younger. In all honesty, I don't exactly remember if I watched the previous film adaptations of the popular franchise, but I do know that both didn't receive the best feedback from critics and audiences, especially the 1997's flick. Therefore, I went to the theater - first time in over four months - with no real expectations. I just hoped the action would compensate for the predictably flawed screenplay.All in all, I'm surprised at how much I actually had fun with this movie. Considering this is Simon McQuoid's feature directorial debut, as well as Greg Russo's first screenplay credit, my hopes rested on Dave Callaham's previous works (Wonder Woman 1984, Zombieland: Double Tap) and on the gory, violent action sequences. The latter component is the best element in the entire film, which will definitely leave the viewers in search of action-heavy entertainment satisfied. The opening sequence shows the merciless brutality of each fight through phenomenal stunt work (Hiroyuki Sanada is impressively talented), long takes with exceptional choreography, and a shocking amount of blood - something quite characteristic of the game franchise.The only negative aspect about this opening is the fact that no other action scene surpasses it, which doesn't mean that the rest of the battles fail to live up to the expectations of the most avid fans. Despite a few shaky, roughly edited scenes, the vast majority of the fights are easy to follow and feature jaw-dropping moments, such as the ""Fatality!"" finishing moves. McQuoid and his team of writers try to make the movie understandable and exciting to everyone, but if there's a chance of placing a reference, an Easter Egg, or something alike, they proudly and unrestrainedly present it to the audience, which will trigger the most hardcore fans to let go of a resounding, adrenaline-fueled ""YEAH!"".I admit that I didn't expect the film to deliver those epic announcements from the game. From ""Flawless Victory!"" to ""Fatality!"", without forgetting the classic ""Fight!"", I did smile during these moments, where the actors actually change the tone of their voice to mimic the famous one-liners. Is it extraordinarily cheesy and over-the-top? Of course. Would any fan want it any other way? It might be a tad too much for some viewers, but I have to compliment McQuoid for fully committing to this adaptation. There's no ounce of shame, regret, or restraint. It's a movie made with a passionate public in mind, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to every single fan of the games.I firmly believe people will end up liking or disliking this film based on how much the action compensates for the lack of a compelling story, which is something even the most enthusiastic fans are probably anticipating as well. From a couple of nonsensical narrative decisions to hollow, uninteresting characters, the screenplay is solely focused on explaining everything surrounding Mortal Kombat - Earthworld, Outworld, champions, stakes, rules of the tournament - through lazy yet admittedly efficient exposition scenes. The characters could have been better developed, and the actors are far from being completely convincing. However, no one will enter the theater or click ""play"" on HBO Max expecting to witness an Oscar-worthy story...Mortal Kombat is a surprisingly decent adaptation of the popular franchise, which will leave the most hardcore fans quite satisfied. For viewers with no experience or knowledge about the games, it could be a tough watch. However, if all the audience seeks is action-heavy entertainment, then Simon McQuoid's directorial debut fulfills the more reasonable expectations. Packed with references that even the least avid gamers will recognize, the fighting scenes are mostly well-filmed and quite energetic, focusing more on the gruesome, bloody, jaw-dropping Fatalities. Despite the opening sequence being the peak of great action, there are a couple of moments that could be compared to some parts of that epic start. Story-wise, Greg Russo and Dave Callaham's screenplay is as flawed as expected, possessing ridiculous developments and an abundance of dull exposition scenes, but it's the underwhelming use of a few interesting characters that negatively impacts the movie the most. In the end, I definitely recommend it to fans of the franchise, who will surely appreciate this film a lot more than myself.Rating: B-",Mortal Kombat

73,SoumikBanerjee25,Would have been considerably better had it been made as a Mini-series!,4,8 May 2021,"Amidst all FATALITIES & BRUTALITIES ""Mortal Kombat"" is strictly catered to the needs of loyal MK fanatics! With the momentous inclusion of several fan-favorite characters; this ought to be a treat to many. However, solely on the basis of a feature-length film; it is clearly miles away from any pleasing remark!""GET OVER HERE""Over the past few days, I have been trying to get myself preoccupied in this whole MK universe! Guilty as charged, I never played any of the video games nor did I watch any of those classic movies. So keep in mind, I'm still new to all this!Having said that, being somewhat a neutral viewer; I will try to put my thoughts into words in the best possible way.Technically, this has been a fine showing. With the Cinematography flattering all those neat Visual effects comprised of Gore and Bloodshed. Alongside a dubstep-inspired Score more or less paying homage to vintage soundtracks.When the characters are concerned, they have given us plenty to talk about! Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Raiden, Shang Tsung, Reiko, Mileena, Goro, Kano, Kabal, Sonya, Jax, And two crucial faces i.e. Scorpion & Sub-Zero! Amongst them Kano, Scorpion, and Sub-Zero stealing every scene they featured in! But the same cannot be said for the rest!And that's where the issues come forth!The underlying structure of the storyline is extremely banal and disarticulated! That distinctly reflects upon the preamble to the characters and the concurrent events that take place at that point in time. Giving a strong impression; that events do unfold out of the blue.In the meantime overall progression gets in too much of a hurry, therefore; the narration feels severely disjointed and unsuitably broken off into discrete pieces without any conceivable link in-between!In a nutshell, It's not a terrible execution by any means. As It did have some sense of appeasement somewhere underneath. From my point of view, this would have been considerably better had it been made as a Mini-series with a handful of episodes to consolidate individual character backstories!Dear Warner Bros. We need an Extended Cut Just Like Snyder's; is that too much to ask for?",Mortal Kombat

76,MrDHWong,Delivers what fans of the franchise have desired after so many years and is also decent martial arts film on its own,7,29 April 2021,"""Mortal Kombat,"" is an action fantasy film based on the video game series of the same name. Directed by Simon McQuoid and co-produced by James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring), it delivers what fans of the franchise have desired after so many years and is also decent martial arts film on its own.While out with his family one night, MMA fighter Cole Young (Lewis Tan) is attacked by a mysterious figure calling himself ""Sub-Zero"" (Joe Taslim) and is soon rescued by a man named Jax (Mehcad Brooks), who tells them to seek out his associate Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee). After Cole discovers Sonya's whereabouts, she informs him of an otherworldly tournament known as ""Mortal Kombat"", where chosen warriors bearing a dragon shaped mark on their bodies fight to the death to defend their respective realms. Cole happens to bear this mark, along with Sonya's captive mercenary Kano (Josh Lawson), and three of them embark on a journey to the temple belonging to Lord Raiden (Tadanobu Asano), the guardian of Earthrealm. Upon arrival, the trio meet with the other chosen fighters Liu Kang (Ludi Lin) and Kung Lao (Max Huang), who begin training them to defeat the reigning champions of Outworld.Movies based on video games are usually of poor quality for the most part. Some range from being cheesy fun, like ""Mortal Kombat 1995"", to downright terrible, like ""Mortal Kombat Annihilation"". It is interesting how both of those films hailing from the same franchise can be so further from each other on the spectrum, but in this 2021 reboot, we now have a safe middle ground for what a video game-based movie should be like. One of the main complaints many had about the 1995 film was how toned down it was in order to fall within the parameters of a PG-13 rating. This film, on the other hand, spares no expense when it comes to piling on the blood and gore with its fatalities - heads are sliced open, limbs are dismembered, and hearts are ripped out of bodies. In other words, this film is considerably more faithful to its source material so long time fans should be pleased to see this. Personally, I only possess a surface level knowledge of the series, having grown up preferring Street Fighter instead, but Mortal Kombat always had my respect for the significant impact it has left on the video game industry and I'll admit the 1995 film, while not that great, is a guilty pleasure of mine. With that said, I'm relieved to finally see a Mortal Kombat film closer in style to the games they originated from, even though I can't say I am able to appreciate it as much as others might.Of course, this wouldn't be much of an adaptation of a fighting game series if it didn't contain some solid fight scenes, and this one has them in spades. In fact, I think there was more physical sparring than important expository dialogue, and while this prevents the film from ever being boring, it does unfortunately lead to some underdeveloped characters and glossed over plot points. Although I did enjoy watching an all-out brawl between opposing fighters, there were times where it felt like characters were simply duking it out for the sake of duking it out, rather than as a reason to advance the story. I would have liked to have seen more of the internalised conflict between the main heroes before they take on the dangerous enemies from Outworld, as this would have made for a better understanding for what is at stake. Regardless, for what we got, the fighting was still very entertaining and choreographed well with minimal shaky cam.From what I can gather, the film's characters appear to have been done justice, at least visually, with Josh Lawson as Kano standing out the most. Being an actual Australian, Lawson's portrayal of this loud mouthed, vulgar mercenary was on point and responsible for a great deal of the film's comic relief. Jessica McNamee also did a nice enough job as Sonya Blade, holding her own alongside the rest of the cast. However, I was somewhat underwhelmed with Lewis Tan's performance as Cole Young, the main protagonist and an entirely new character created specifically for this film. Even though he excels in combat scenes, Tan's delivery of his dialogue felt wooden and stiff, making it difficult for me to care about him whenever he was placed in danger. On that note, he felt like a Gary Stu (the male equivalent of a Mary Sue), with everything magically working out for him in the face of adversity. As for everyone else, they were either there to spout exposition or be name dropped as fanservice for avid followers of the series.As far as video game film adaptations go, ""Mortal Kombat 2021"" is definitely one of the better ones, although considering how low the bar is, this isn't saying a whole lot. It offers plenty of gory fatalities and brutalities to satisfy fans while also featuring enough regular action to hold a newcomer's attention. There is already talk of a sequel if this film is a success and I welcome the idea of it as there are still many more frontiers to be explored with the franchise, as long as they don't go down the same route as MK: Annihilation. If only the Street Fighter series could have the same amount of attention focused around it for a new and improved live-action feature. I guess we'll have to wait and see.I rate it 6.5/10.",Mortal Kombat
77,cardsrock,Give me more gore,6,12 May 2021,"The gore and violence was definitely the standout here, I just wanted more of it. Any time the movie switched to supremely dull Cole Young or the main story, it really dragged. Kano steals the show and does his best to make things entertaining.

Not anyone who isn't completely high or a too-hardcore fan of MK, anyway.The first one in the 90's was just WAY better (a solid 10 compared to this). I can see why a lot of people are losing faith in the movie industry now (I just thought they made a few bad movies, but maybe they have ""lost their mojo"").Scorpion and Subzero should be yellow and blue, respectively, but that's just me (spoiler, I guess).But hey, maybe you'll like it.

80,elicopperman,Meant More for the Fans,5,25 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat is one of the most well known game franchises of today, having gone from resurrecting the popularity of arcade games in the early 1990s to spawning dozens of spinoff games, shows, and even film adaptations. While the 1995 film and its sequel are unfortunate misfires in the franchise's run, that didn't stop Warner Bros from trying again and rebooting the games back into cinema. So after years of development hell, the new adaptation was finally released in both theaters and HBO Max subsequently, with Saw director James Wan co-producing. Now as a non-fan of the franchise, having seen this movie, I was rather polarized personally.The bare bones premise of this film centers around MMA fighter Cole Young, who seeks out Earth's greatest champions to stand against the enemies of Outworld in a high stakes battle for the universe. If that sounds very straightforward and even painfully obvious, then the movie's execution is even more predictable. Throughout the whole movie, one can easily tell what plot point will come up, especially regarding Cole and the underdog ragtag team of heroes trying to defend Earth. Even though the cast is trying their hardest to make their characters engaging, the weak script doesn't really allow the characters to be anything more than one note (although Josh Lawson is delightfully witty as Kano). It's really unfortunate that even during the higher stakes throughout the film's latter half, I couldn't get invested due to the boring characters and nearly tapped out. It's nice to have protagonists who are flawed in their skills, but they become so easily defeatable that it's almost pathetic. Maybe the shorter run time has to do with it, but I was hoping for at least some intrigue in this cast.However, even with the lame story, I imagine that the film's target audience of Mortal Kombat fans will be pleased the most. Given that this film is rated R, unlike the 1995 film, there's a lot more carnage and gore for the blood hungry fans of the franchise to get invested in. It also helps that the movie is quite faithful to the video games as a whole, so people who are quite familiar with the games and characters might pick up on more detail than the average viewer. It also helps that the fight choreography is thoroughly well planned out and a lot more easy to digest than most action blockbusters where the camerawork is so busy that you can barely pick up what's going on in the first place. Also, the mythos behind Cole's ancestry, while seemingly far fetched, does provide the necessary context as to why the villainous Sub Zero would pose such an immediate threat throughout the film's runtime. Even when the martial arts choreography is drowned out by special effects, that shouldn't stop the video game enthusiasts from enjoying this flick.So in the end, while by no means worth watching for everyone, this new adaptation of Mortal Kombat might at least satisfy its intended demographic. It seems like video game film adaptations are slowly starting to rise back up in popularity over these past few years, and content like this has proven to be no exception. Admittedly, it's only a matter of time before the film's financial return says anything regarding its outcome, but at least the film is under the $100 million borderline, so it might not be a complete bomb. Let's just let the audience vote with their wallets and give this film the benefit of the doubt.",Mortal Kombat

The script is too cheesy and not risky.Second, even the Fx's are most pretty well done, sometimes it looks like a mess. Also, blood and Fatalities are only in a few scenes. Not enough.

Mortal Kombat is something I've wanted to see solely based on the trailer. I've never played the game it had much knowledge on it, but I figured I'd get a good sense from the movie. And I tried. Really I did. But I really didn't like this movie. As a game Mortal Kombat might work, but when it comes to the screen I'm not sure they've been able to get it as good as it could be. From what I know, this movie is a good representation of the game. The action sequences are really good and some are fun to watch. When it comes to story, and I know most will defend the movie because the story isn't a main focus point, I was extremely bored. The opening is really great and sets up to be a fun watch. Come an hour in, not much has happened. The second half is better, but my interest level never really increased. The characters are never really developed enough to care about. When it comes to the script, it's lazily written. In the game, witty one-liners may work, but here they're cringe worthy. By the end, only the action scenes were redeemable for me. They're very well executed and represent the game well. I may have not played the game, but we all know very well what the action is like. The violence is raised up to the point that it feels like a scene from Evil Dead. Honestly, there's not much more to say. Fans may like it and general movie-goers.

But rest of actors weren't famous in it and also I wish this rebootwould have got bigger budget, better actors look acting wasn't issue actors weren't issue it's about getting actors right not getting actors for explame Jax was far too small for his role they should got Michael Jai White again because he was in web series Mortal Kombat or Mike Colter as Jax or Terry Crews not Mehcad Brooks his far too small for his role Jax is meant to be huge not small guy with Muscles anyday anytime I would say Michael Jai White would whoop Mehcad Brooks ass anytime, I thought cast was just misplaced including with Sonja Blade (Jessica McNamee) known for The Meg that's it I know from her they should off got another actress for Sonja Blade that is Amy Johnston she is not that famous she is martial artist and a stuntwoman I think she can do all her fights and stunts all herself that would been amazing if you seen Lady Bloodfight, for Kano Josh Lawson is breaking law of his character does do justice he doesn't have metal plate on his face he is far too small, story doesn't tell how he got the laser eye. I wanted cast to be much bigger sadly wasn't. That's little issue with film, but sametime your not here for story your not here for Oscars your here to see fighting, Flawless Victory, Gore, characters I thought characters of how they look with costumes all that looked great I liked look of Sub-Zero with mask all that it looked very well made costumes. Action was slaright forward full on gore andalso villain characters were good looking like for Milena, Shang Tsung, Kabal they looked good didn't look to fake with their costumes I thought that looked good, movie didn't look cheap but what made it look cheap is having actors that is not known expect for actors who Scorpion and Sub-Zero and Sonja that's all I know from them, idk hiring very cheap actors expect those actors I mention that I know. Cast could been better, Cinematography all that looked great, fight scenes perfect shot not original but gore looked great HARDCORE R-RATED looked great for film as always, action was fun to watch I thought this was fun and enjoyable had tons of laugh's, tons of fun in movie your here for fighting, crazy insane gore witch it was fantastic look for film that what made me to like movie I had fun with it could not dislike movie I enjoyed it storyline follows MMA fighter Cole Young (Lewis Tan) known for Den of Thieves, Wu Assassins, Deadpool 2, Into the Badlands. Cole Young is character that wasn't in game but that's idea they toke from Resident Evil Paul W. S Anderson film where he made character Alice Milla Jovovich character that wasn't based on game. That's all idea from movie and Cole Young didn't care for that all I care about is film and other characters and action didn't care for Cole Young I wanted Scorpion to lead instead of Cole Young witch that character didn't do anything for me but his not bad actor but it's just that his character didn't do jack crap for me rest of them did not Cole Young character he lost fight in MMA witch I thought you could off have done something to get out of choke but anyway it's movie Sub-Zero is after Cole Young, as you know Jax (Mehcad Brooks) saves Cole Young tells him what is going on then Cole Young seeks out Earth's greatest champions in order to stand against the enemies of Outworld in a high stakes battle for the universe. Threw out entire film was insane gore, great fight scenes full of action it was just a fun movie. Constantly throwing jokes and insults at other characters. Probably one of the funniest, self aware movie characters I've seen but rest of other jokes were not funny they were too over top witch some little jokes didn't make sense for movie.There are also weird editing jumps in the movie, one moment you're looking at characters interacting and in the next you're looking at something completely different. The movie suffers from a few of these, but see what happens if you get a director that never ever made movie Simon McQuoid given director first foray into the world of movie making, and they should got a different director Maybe Paul WS Anderson who made original film or Chad Stahelski or Gareth Evans someone knows Mortal Kombat very well who made previous amazing action films not having someone who hasn't made a single movie or who hasn't made a action movie before Simon McQuiod is his first film James Wan?? I don't know 50.50 depends what his idea is they toke so much time with project and how did they go with this idea why could they just go with different idea for movie just have simple idea of having Scorpion as lead role then have Cole Young as not lead just character in movie that's it could have switched opposite idea. Funny thing in movie when you have Milena in movie she is villain where the heck is Kitana how can we have Mileena without Kitana?? Because if her sister Mileena is in movie where in all time is Kitana?? Theirs a bunch of actress they could Ktiana Gal Gadot but I bet they can't afford her she is too expensive she better be like actress Talisa Soto she was soo hot in 95 Mortal Kombat film better found actress someone like that she looks like exactly Kitana if you look at game and her in 95 film that looks like her. But seriously having Mileena in film without Kitana doesn't work really because then in next film what would Kitana do? What is her character then? She would mention about her sister and what just have Kitana on her own not have her with Mileena?? Jeez writers or director been sleepwalking while playing game that's what it is you can't have Mileena and Kitana together in film that works if you just have them 2 together fighting but just having Mileena looked very odd too my opinion when you watch trailer of this movie or anything like that don't expect too much or else it will be a letdown don'texpect everything in this movie, I can't wait until they get Johnny Cage in sequel I wanna see Scott Adkins as Johnny Cage having actor who has experience in martial arts don't have actors that are non experience in martial arts just like with rest of cast expect for Joe Taslim I want a cast that is martial arts it's not meant to be actors who has experience or performance this is meant to be fighting film with actors who has martial arts experience not having non experience actors who don't know martial arts oh we are gonna train them it's not point the point is having martial arts actors like Scott Adkins in movie suits, he can perform he is own stunts having actor who is martial artist it's better to have Experienced martial artist then to have non martial artist for sequel to have Scott Adkins as Johnny Cage would suits in Mortal Kombat movie not because of Martial arts, because he look like Johnny Cage, has same fight moves, has humour of Johnny Cage but anyway this was fun movie I highly recommended to see at theaters it's fun experience also just let you know they do play theme but not original theme sadly they play Mortal Kombat 2021 Theme Song Techno Syndrome type not original I reckon original was better theme.",Mortal Kombat
90,stevenrotherforth,Just watch the opening ten minutes on YouTube instead,4,28 April 2021,"Mortal KombatThe trailer promised a movie that punched above its weight and from the opening ten minutes it did look like we were going to get that movie.The beginning of the movie sets up two intriguing characters and their rivalry. It's well made too.The fight choreography blends superbly with the gore. Then it all goes to pot!Mortal Kombat quickly descends into utter unfathomable nonsense.This certainly is a movie made for the fans.If you are unaware and uneducated in the Mortal Kombat law then you will struggle with the movie's absurdity.For the none hardcore fans a decent martial arts movie would suffice.Sadly we don't even get that. After the excellent opening the fight scenes then become poorly edited. By no means 'Resident Evil bad' but the quick cut style editing is fatiguing on the eye. What happened, did they get a different person to direct the rest of the movie?Excellent talent such as Hiroyuki Sanada and Joe Taslim are unable to shine because of the plummeting quality.Still they are both the movies standouts despite the choppy editing and lacklustre fight choreography.None of the blows have any real impact except the final fatal strike.Tame is a word that's a little too harsh but the movie poorly imitates the video game.Lead character Cole Young played by Lewis Tan has all the charisma of a wet dishcloth and isn't even needed. The Cole character was especially dreamt up for this movie.Why?There's already a bunch of interesting characters from the game that could have been better utilised. Instead some core characters are pushed to the back to make way for Cole Young.It's not all bad. Josh Lawson as Kano is hilarious and Jennifer McNamee is always watchable.That's about it guys!I'm really struggling to find anything memorable about this movie. Sure it's better than the original versions from the 90's but that's hardly saying much.If you're a hardcore Mortal Kombat fan then I'm sure you will find enjoyment in this latest effort to reboot the franchise.As for the rest of us?The opening ten minutes are available on YouTube.Just watch that instead.",Mortal Kombat
91,drpainters,Winner the audience,7,26 April 2021,"This was an entertaining well done adaptation. Moved along well, some story issues but you come for a fight movie and it succeeds.

They got details right, the perfect amount of blood, the story was intriguing, I dont understand all the negative reviews as I thought this was amazing from start to finish. This film is the type you gotta see if you're a die hard fan of the games, I didnt think I'd enjoy it as much as I did, im very glad I checked it out.Such an experience its a shame the cinemas wasn't open, highly recommend this to fans and non fans.",Mortal Kombat

94,maxglen,A decent video game movie but don't expect much in the way of story,7,24 April 2021,"If you go into this looking for a gory, silly action flick with little in the way of story, you're going to have a good time. Me and my other half watched it cinema style with some popcorn and the lights off and we had a blast but if you go in thinking this is going to be anything other than what I've described, you'll be sorely disappointed. The effects vary from not great to really good. The acting is the same, Kano, Scorpion, Kung Lao and Sub Zero were highlights. The fight scene choreography isn't amazing but it's decent and the gore makes up for what it lacks. The soundtrack is also dope and very much evokes that 90s techno score we got in the original film adaptation while also being it's own thing. I'm going to give it a 7 as I enjoyed it very much but it's doesn't do much to be anything else other than what you expect it to be.",Mortal Kombat
95,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,An uninspired attempt at launching a new film franchise that will probably work,5,27 April 2021,"Well, it started off strong, then fell off quick. The first 10 minutes are honestly fantastic. But then, we are introduced to our ""heroes"", and the majority of the next hour feels like nothing but exposition and introductions, often disguised as ""training"". If your characters aren't going to have any depth whatsoever, I would suggest much less dialogue and much more action. Finally, in the final third of the film we get ""a bunch of fights"", only the majority of them are lodged into a quick 5-10 minute period, overlapping each other, some lasting less than a minute - it really does feel like a bit of a ripoff. The final battle and the fight with Goro are the only other really strong sequences, outside of the opening - but it's definitely not enough to redeem the entire film. There are also a couple sequences in which they used some of the villains in a horror movie fashion, which was a pleasant surprise and worked really well when they did it. The gore was definitely one of the strongest features of the movie - when it went hard, it went hard and it satisfied. When death comes, there is plenty of blood - and even some guts!The greatest weaknesses, other than the fact that the entire meat of the movie was taken up by weak dialogue that goes nowhere and dull training sequences, is in the writing, acting, and casting - Raiden, Liu Kang, and Kung Lao were all vapid and completely lacking heart and likability. Even Shang Tsung had a dull, underwhelming presence. A lot of the key lines felt weakly delivered and, thus, forced. I enjoyed the gal who played Sonya, looking like an even cross between Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Nicole Aniston. Kano was sufficient but the way he was just a carbon copy of the Kano from Paul W. S. Anderson's 1996 film was kind of silly. No one really got a chance to shine in their role, to be honest, but Sub-Zero probably did the best.And then, there's the music score...I'm not sure how you could feel content following up one of the most iconic soundtracks of the 90's with a score as bland and uncharismatic as this. The movie is chock full of cues that are sonically ""on par"" with contemporary music scores, but offer ZERO personality - nothing to give this new film it's own identity. The techno-industrial-metal hybrid of the original film not only perfectly captured relevant bands that were ahead of their time at the time but also went above and beyond in the way they complemented the intensity of the action and sat in loyally with the franchise's ongoing vibe. This score is cliche, uninspired throwaway.My primary thought is that, if you're a fan of superhero movies, there's no reason you shouldn't like this. This plays just like a lower-budget, middle-tier super hero movie - the way it's paced, written, edited, etc - it's exactly the same thing - the only difference is that they had a lower budget so they worked with no name actors rather than big names. It's just as good as the most mediocre of superhero films, and just as corny. Kabal was literally just Deadpool - it was so blatant. It's not a good movie but in an era where super hero movies are the only things that get any real funding or budgets anymore, the team that made this at least deserve to be part of that shallow support system. I feel like that's what this movie was: a grab by some lesser known filmmakers to get in on that big franchise money all the superhero filmmakers are attaining - at least these guys tried to do it with something other than Marvel or DC... might as well let them have it.",Mortal Kombat
96,colewaters,Now that's what I call a movie,10,25 April 2021,Mortal Kombat was definitely one of the best movies I have seen in years. Every second got better and better. I highly recommend this movie. The graphics were on point.,Mortal Kombat
97,daisukereds,It's not the best one so far.. is it? That would be sad,6,25 April 2021,"Overall, good action scenes, which is what people will watch this for.I was more impressed by the beautiful design and production!! The adaptation of some of the characters (specially our ""favorite speedster"") was a great use of budget. The CGI is on point for the time we are in. The dialogue, interactions and the story is on par with what you'd get in a Mortal Kombat movie (the forced references sometimes are a bit much). The cast is mostly ok (Asano-san and Sanada-san are always a treat!).. but the lead actor should have been relegated to a support character instead.The structure of the movie was a tad different from what I was expecting. You can feel the good guys having the short end of the stick from the get-go. And the irony of the title of the movie was an unexpected turn.. Still, I enjoyed it! Though, probably won't ever watch it again. Maybe if it does well and the sequel is actually made and I forget it completely, and for some reason need a reminder of what happens in a movie that doesn't really need a re-watch.",Mortal Kombat
98,backup-50362,"I had low expectations, this was a great surprise",1,25 April 2021,"Unlike most game-based movies only this one and the Sonic movie managed to do it mostly right!Let's start with the writing, which is both genius and stupid. Kano's comedic relief was outstanding, priceless, both the actor and his lines were amazing. But some of the other writing was super dumb. A specific scene comes to mind, that mostly goes as follows - ""We're doomed, without him we can't win"" - ""Guys, we have to fight."" - ""Oh okay, we're all suddenly positive about it now that you said that generic one line.""Anyways, acting and casting. Generally great, except for Sonya. It was absolute cringe that she can beat Kano effortlessly with him landing very few hits, despite being much bigger and stronger than her. That's some Captain Marvel garbage. If you look at the original lady who played Sonia in the game - she was (and still is!) actually tough, muscular, I can buy her kicking butt. But this Sonya wasn't. How come all the male actors you picked are jacked to high heavens but you didn't hire a physically strong woman to play Sonia? Bias much?Sigh, whatever. I'm used to this at this point, plus it's actually a minor annoyance in a generally great film. It's fun, the effects are cool, it has great, clever nods to the games (even if some were way forced). Whether you're an MK fan or just want to watch a cool Kung Fu fantasy movie - you'll enjoy this.Generally great. Not sure why the 6/10 rating, but I'm guessing it'll get higher as more people see it.",Mortal Kombat
99,backup-50362,"Good action, fantasy and comedy",1,26 April 2021,"Of course dumb IMDB didn't publish my original review, but this time I'm taking screenshots and sharing them everywhere if they do that again.Anyway, the actor who played Kano did carry this movie. His performance and the writing for that character were hilarious, and kept the movie from getting cringey and overly-serious.The effects and cinematography were cool too, even if some moments were awfully basic. There was a real conversation that went like this: ""Oh no, we won't be able to do this."" - ""Come on guys, we have to do this"". - ""Oh okay, we'll do this!"" But the plentiful nods to the games and Kano's writing managed to steal the show from the occasionally bad writing.The actress who played Sonya managing to effortlessly beat up huge guys is cringe. I know that's common in Hollywood movies, we're supposed to pretend that's possible, but if you look at the original lady who played Sonya in the original games - she was actually muscular (and still is in great shape!). Now she - I can believe she might be able to take a huge guy like Kano. But this Sonya was annoyingly written and badly cast.Speaking of bad casting, Shang Tzung wasn't as threatening as he should've been. Sub Zero on the other hand is absolutely imposing and believable as a super powerful warrior, but like I said, not everyone else fit their role that well.In any case, good movie, definitely doesn't deserve such a low rating. MK fans might be disappointed with the not-so-solid lore (was it ever great?) and more notably - the obligatory set up for a Johnny Kage sequel. Meaning there's no Johnny Kage here. But hey. Still fun action/fantasy/comedy movie. For 2021 - well above the average.",Mortal Kombat

Characters and their abilities were also very well done.The main problem with the movie was that storyline was predictable from the beginning. The plot could have been better. Expectations go high when studio takes 20 years to make a reboot. Overall, a total enjoyment (if you watch it without high expectations).",Mortal Kombat

102,fciocca,Could have been much more. A forgettable video game adaptation.,4,26 April 2021,"I was expecting way more from this movie. ""Mortal Kombat"" is all about fighting. In original games there is a background story, but it is not so important, because the focus is mainly on action and gruesome fatalities. It should have been just one hour an half of mindless violence. Who cares if Cole has a family to protect? Who cares about Sonya Blade and her military career? Who cares how Jung Lao and Liu Kang are related? This mania of Hollywood to deepen characters and create subplots, even when it is not required at all, is something that I don't understand. This is a popcorn flick, it will not for sure be nominated to Oscars.Have you ever seen fatalities in MK games? The latest two chapters have some crazy stuff. Why the movie did not push more boundaries? Show me some nasty stuff, this is why I approached this film: show me blood, guts, broken bones, spines. I have to admit that Sub Zero effects are impressive, for sure my favorites. The way he exploits ice at his advantage is amazing and original. Beside this, I cannot say that I was impressed. Also, they could have done much more with camera movements and shootings. They could have been so creative.I am not a huge fan of the saga, I play once in a while and I enjoy matches with friends. I was waiting for this movie for a while, but unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The ending set up for a sequel. This is another mania from the showbiz, force movies into franchises, before even know if it will be well received by the audience. If you want to go on with this saga, drop useless and boring storylines and focus more on violence.",Mortal Kombat
103,DeBBss,Give me a movie about the first 10 minutes,4,15 July 2021,"The best part about this movie are its first 10 minutes. If they just gave us that then I'm sure we could've gotten the best video-game movie adaptions ever. It would've been way better than what we actually got. Imagine, a Hiroyuki Sanada Scorpion vs Sub-Zero in a samurai era Japan; instead we get a generic movie with a generic plot about generic characters. I came for Scorpion and Sub-Zero and I only got Sub-Zero. I don't care about Cole Young, and it doesn't help that he's the most boring character in the movie.But, if you only care about brutal fights scenes, then you'll somewhat get what you came for. There are plenty of fights, but arguably they're not that well done. The choreography and creativity is there, but the editing is hot garbage. It's so hard to tell what's going on when the camera is jumping every half a second. And with all the fight scenes, there are like two fatality-like kills. This film is rated R and it's called Mortal Kombat, but you only add two fatalities, come on.The story isn't that good, most of the character are bland to okay, the fight scenes are underwhelming, and the visuals are decent. I think we could've gotten something way better, maybe my expectations were too high for a film like this. I got disappointed because they couldn't even get the most important things right. I'd only recommend this film for Mortal Kombat fans, because if you came for any specific thing, then you're guaranteed to be disappointed.",Mortal Kombat

Mortal kombat is about an MMA fighter Cole young who seeks out Earth's greatest champions in order to stand against the enemies of outworld in a high stakes battle for the universe.Mortal Kombat for me was very bad and a huge mess. However, the cinematography and set pieces were great. The action and gore we did get was fantastic and very entertaining. I thought the opening was very emotional and effective. The sound design was great. The rising of tension was great and the set up was fun. There was some good building of story world. It was funny in places, with some great references to the video games. Whilst also having some fun action scenes in the final act.However, there was a lot of rushed explanation of things so people aren't hardcore fans of the video games would probably get confused like I was in places. There was some really lazy set up for the main character. The script and the performances from most of the cast was absolutely terrible, it baffled me as to how some of the actors and screenwriters weren't cut. It was predictable, it repeated certain plot points way too often. It had so many pacing issues, with a lack of action and too much sitting around doing nothing. It was very oddly structured in parts. Some of the characters just got really annoying and for me their was a lack of chemistry between the whole cast. I didn't connect to the main character at all, and I unfortunately think it was because of the very mediocre and sub par performance. The characters from the games were incredibly underused. There was some very odd character decisions, some poorly executed plot twists. And for me the final act was a complete mess.So overall, Mortal Kombat does boast some impressive cinematography and action sequences. And should mostly satisfy Mortal Kombat fans with the fatalities and the inclusion of so many of the characters. But the script and the performances were painfully poor. Whilst also criminally underusing so many characters that fans of the games love with a complete lack of action. And when a Mortal Kombat movie is playing it safe you know something is wrong, it always just felt like a set up for a sequel and not its own film. If they do a sequel I would recommend getting new screenwriters and replacing 90% of the cast.",Mortal Kombat
105,gavinp9,Semi-tongue-in-cheek action silliness,5,23 April 2021,"'Mortal Kombat' is a reboot of the 1995 film based on the early 90s arcade game. As such, the bar is quite low! The story revolves around Hanzo (Sanada), who battles Sub Zero (Taslim) in samurai-era Japan. We then cut to 500 years later and Hanzo's heir, Cole (Tan) is a semi-washed-up MMA fighter trying to support his family, when he's approached by Jax (Brooks) and Sonya (McNamee) to inform him that he's a Champion and needed to defend Earth. Fighting ensues!We never really learn where or when it's set, but it doesn't really matter and the outback South Australia scenery is great to see on screen and gives it an otherworldly vibe, as it's not the standard ""American West"". There's some allusions as to the why/what ""Mortal Kombat"" is and we then get to see Raiden (Asano), Kang (Lin) & Lao (Huang), as well as the ""bad guys"", Nitara (Jarnson) & Tsung (Han) + Sub Zero in full costume, as they set out to destroy Earth. Special mention to Kano (Lawson), who brings comedic relief and is super-annoying - hopefully on purpose!With the solid pacing and OK set-up in the first 15min, the film definitely meanders all over the shop and seems like it's episode 3 of a 10-part TV series, before it gets 70min and realises it needs to make something happen, so suddenly there's heaps of fighting and individual battles, before the big sequel-setting-finale. For an R-rated film, probably not as gory as I was expecting, but still some laugh-inducing deaths.",Mortal Kombat

108,flingebunt,Action and storying telling linked in great special effects driven marital arts fantasy film,8,8 June 2021,"The art of a good action movie is that all action sequences progress the plot. The sign of a great action movie is where all action sequences are intertwined deeply with the story. Many movies attempt one or both, and often do it clumsily, while Mortal Kombat achieves this superbly.Yes, some of the special effects are a little clumsy, but most are amazing, and the fights seem to be a little hurried, while the middle section of the movie bogs itself down in cliche, it still ends well with fight scenes that tell more with punches, throws and special movies than most movies convey with dialogue. What you see is a masterclass in minimalist story telling embedded in great action sequences. Might be a little hurried, but still works.Ultimately though, this is a movie for fans of the games and the series, martial arts fans and so on, rather than the general public.",Mortal Kombat

113,mike-c-b,Virtue signalling with loving eyes or hate-joking. No professionalism at all.,1,28 April 2021,"The start is laughably cliche as a family virtue signals to each other with loving eyes, completely ruining the illusion of a hard working life and that any of them know how to defend themselves, at all.Lewis Tan virtue signals with glowing eyes non-stop for no reason (he also did the same on instagram all throughout the filming), except fight scenes. After fight scenes he virtue signals with love in his tummy again. Zero profesionalism. In one scene he hate-argues with a confused old man, both acting tough towards each other with cliche lines. No really strong person acts tough, yet this is somehow the LEAD in a Mortal Kombat film?Fight scenes are zoomed-in and jump cut to show drama. This is done in every other movie to hide bad fighting. The fighting itself is good in this movie, but you'll never see it. Audience is zoomed-in on frequently as if the viewer is asking for their approval, and your own view doesn't matter.All voice-overs are fake and show no passion for the words they're saying, at all.During any action that happens, the camera focuses on anything that moves fast and loud music is played. The loud music distracts you from the fight scene in a poor attempt to add more drama, which was never needed in the first place, and doesn't let the viewer decide what they look at and how they process it. The camera shakes nervously, zooms in on feet, looking right at scared faces.The whole point of Mortal Kombat as a film/tv series is good fight scenes and 100% real story and characters. The natural drama involved purely due to the situation of the characters is enough to entertain. This movie has okay fight scenes, and fakes everything else like it's normal...Easily replaced by 110 minutes of people acting tough, grateful with glowing eyes, a shakey camera, and loud music.Watch the Mortal Kombat Conquest TV series instead if you want more than the first two 1990's movies.",Mortal Kombat

Shang Tsung, Subzero and Scorpion are menacing and convincing enough to keep your attention.Other than that, the movie felt more like a rushed pilot, and the mediocre acting and special effects had more in common with the '98 series MK: Conquest, than with the iconic '95 movie which had the atmosphere, chemistry and fight choreography that this new movie lacks.Enjoy it for the memories that are already yours, and the inevitable Scorpion vs Subzero fight. The movie has not much else to offer.",Mortal Kombat
116,dasa108,Bad movie,3,4 July 2021,"This film is the clear demonstration of a Hollywood law: every time you remake, the original film remains like a masterpiece. And that the original was not a big deal! The mortal kombat tournament does not take place in this film, which indicates that it was seeded to reap sequels. The problem is that the chosen warriors look like Power Rangers: there are of every color and race and yet the best in the game hardly stand out. Kung Lao is the best in this movie so imagine the rest. The best dialogue goes to Kano who is a minor character in the game. The villains don't stand out, the opening story looks like a carbon copy of the web series, and some of the characters are definitely pitiful. The fights are few and not above average. It is a film only for fans who give a damn about the coherence of the film and its relationship to the original story. Bad movie.",Mortal Kombat
117,coombsstephen,Good action movie with a few laughs,7,22 May 2021,"This isn't really my cup of tea but I must say I really enjoyed it.There is non stop action and quite a few laughs as well.It looks set up for a sequel, I just hope it's as good.",Mortal Kombat
118,Darkjak007,This world is not fully developed,5,23 April 2021,"It's passable for general audience but mortal kombat fan should've gotten more. The cast is a split bag for every good thing about them there's something wrong with them. Firstly Cole while not as horrible is still really boring and unnecessary many of the scene that could been use for Sonia, Kano and others are being spent on him and his family with a really stupid justification for his importance. He's a failed MMA fighter Who they really emphasize is a terrible fighter has to find his inner power to success in the tournament. They really try to make care about him the whole film but you just don't. Every fan will say the same thing that he's pointless. The characters in this franchise there's no reason for you to make one up at all. It's quite obvious that Cole is taken Johnny Cages Place from the fact that he's the one who fights Goro. Which is unacceptable for the character who's suppose to be the introduction to this world for the audience Johnny's the most suitable for that task this movie did not need cole. The only one more pointless then Cole is Raiden who doesn't do a damn thing in this movie. This is the god of thunder & the protector of earthrealm but he doesn't do anything of motivation for the fighters. You even wish for him to say I must consult the elder gods but doesn't. Lui Kang and Kung Lao aren't introduced for about 40 minutes. Lui Kang is shafted as the chosen one in favor of Cole. He gives speeches of wisdom basically taken raiden job but he's not that shaolin master with that Bruce lee mentality from the games. Kung Lao, who usually overlooked by Lui Kang actually gets more respect in this movie overshadowing him which is a nice Change of pace. Kano's great the comic relief he's crude and vulgar hands down the best portrayal in the movie. Though he should have his cybernetics. Sonia starts off good but is absent from the fighting most of the film they add this ridiculous rule that only one's with with the dragon mark can fight in mortal kombat they bring it up multiple times and comes off rather disrespectful to her character. She also explains to Cole want mortal kombat is as if she and Jax would know that before meeting raiden. Both her and Jax you don't really know anything about them, the special forces is pretty much none existent. Similar to Mortal kombat: Scorpions revenges they just expected you to know these people. Lastly the opening with Scorpion and subzero if your looking forward to a whole movie of them your going to be disappointed it's not the tone for the whole movie. The fighting scenes are bland and of course the gore is a beauty.however the duels all seem rather rushed and pushed more towards the end and when they start there over rather quick. They should've space the Fight out more and had more action. The music alright and the effects are good especially on Subzero. This film takes a ton of liberties not saying that they had to rehash the same plot of mk1 with the island tournament but it might as well giving how there a cliffhanger for sequel . There's no rules interference of the mortal kombat. You don't know anything about the other realms or the elder gods. Mileena is just here with no Mention of Kitana its really out of place. While you see images of Shao khan he's not even mentioned by name! You don't see any location of outworld but derserted landscape. They don't really say who Shang Tsung is he's really generic, with no devilish charm whatsoever. You don't see the Netherrealm you don't see orderrealm or chaosrealm. The shaolin temple's a ruin with no culture to it doesn't feel like a place where white lotus Shaolin monks are born. Scorpion returns as a Hellspawn but Quan chi not brought up at all. The movies a subpar take of franchise while not great it does have something to offer and how this movie ends we most likely will be getting a sequel. If It wasn't for Kano the movie would've been worst.",Mortal Kombat
119,dk77dk,Disappointing,2,25 April 2021,"Really disappointing considering that the film is not a lukewarm PG-13, but a real R rated one.The film is so boring that neither the R rating nor the great Hiroyuki Sanada can save it, and the jokes are pathetic.The story is bad, and I really don't understand why Johnny Cage isn't in the movie. Truly the only thing good in the film is Scorpion, the rest is disaster.The story is catastrophically bad, they made such a bad plot, they could have simply used the concept they had in the game. The movies are getting worse and worse overall, and this one just confirms that. In short, the film is boring, the fight scenes are nothing special, the jokes are pathetic.Maybe the film would have looked better if it had had a capable director who would have made a better film even from such a bad script.A film that is not worth wasting time on.",Mortal Kombat
120,zac-04879,Great MK Characters,6,30 May 2021,"Best suited for the fans of the games, fatalities and brutal fights, the new Mortal Kombat tale is an exciting, gory and grand reboot. However, newcomers to this series are likely to find the film tedious, so they are better off starting with the previous MK games and films. Still though, there's always room for improvement and at least there's plenty of those fantasy-action fights that we were expecting.Now, what especially makes Mortal Kombat an acceptable reboot are the great-looking and well-constructed characters. They each have really awesome skills which make the battles even more appealing. But not only are the characters visually striking; they are fun and hilarious! Who in the world didn't want the classic MK fighters to be silly and comical. Also, the CGI characters such as Goro and the Reptile make some of the unforgettable Mortal Kombat villains.Yet there are plenty of people who will be disappointed by those characters. What was disappointing about the CGI characters is the fact that they would only appear for 5 minutes each throughout the movie and only for their fights. Other than that, the story was just fine. Yes it's a decent idea for a start but if a sequel comes along, hopefully it won't disappoint.But this entertaining MK reboot is satisfying, and the characters, fights and fatalities are all impressive. This gory action-fantasy is certainly a great recommendation for those who love the games or violent martial arts fantasy films.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Mortal Kombat
121,TheOne746,Should have had a bigger roster,8,23 April 2021,"This movie was very entertaining, but way too short. If I had known this movie could be this entertaining, I would have extended its runtime to 20-30 more minutes and give it an actual tournament instead of fights being there because of run ins the characters have. In conclusion, this movie sets up a lot of potential for the sequel. It really could be a lot better and the roster should be a lot more than what this movie had. Honestly wish it could have been better and by the time you finish the movie you really feel like it needed like 20-30 more minutes or a second part immediately kind of like Lord of the Rings where they were released one year apart. But since they didn't shoot it back to back because they are depending on this one being a success we are left with hunger for the sequel and we are left with no taste for a lot of time because the sequel is probably releasing in 2-3 years and that is if this movie is a success. Now I get why this franchise could have worked a lot better as a show of 2-3 seasons of 10 episodes. I also think a lot of the ""deaths"" in the movie were meaningless because at the end we don't know if they get resurrected for the sequel. If we are being honest there was probably one official death from the roster in the movie and it kind of doesn't leave any stakes for this movie if they really stay alive for the sequel.",Mortal Kombat
122,darkreignn,A very fun flick,7,1 May 2021,"I consider myself a gamer (and yes, I do live in my parents' basement), but ""Mortal Kombat"" has never been one of my favorite game franchises. Sure, the fatalities are always entertaining, but fighting games have never been my cup of tea, and maybe that's because I don't have many friends to play them with. Regardless, I was very much looking forward to watching ""Mortal Kombat"" 2021, because I'm a big fan of martial arts films, and it just looked flat-out entertaining. And I'm happy to report that, for the most part, it is.""Mortal Kombat"" delivers practically everything you'd expect from this type of film - bloody violence, uniquely bizarre characters, and an undercurrent of dark comedy that makes everything that much more fun to watch. Yes, the action is as brutal as you expect, but it's also incredibly well-choreographed and slickly edited. The editing is fast, but not so rapid as in a film like ""Taken 3;"" instead, ""Mortal Kombat's"" editing makes for kinetic, but still coherent, fight sequences. There are, of course, the fatalities that you know and love, but I was shocked when I found myself enjoying the action in general, and not just the gory finishing movies - there is real competency at play here, both in front of and behind the camera, that elevates the work.The weakest link in this movie is perhaps its main character, Cole Young, played by Lewis Tan. While he wasn't bad in the role, and also had some of the most brutal action scenes, he seems to be lacking the necessary amount of charisma to lead a film like this. And this criticism has nothing to do with the man himself, but instead with his character. There is nothing very memorable about his character, nothing that makes him stand out from the pack. Cole is serviceable, and even entertaining at points, but as a whole he did seem mildly bland, especially when compared to other characters such as Kano, Jax, and Sonya Blade (Kano especially is a show stealer, and is worth watching the movie for).The only other critique I have of this movie is that there was no real tournament taking place - sure, there's plenty of action, but I would've enjoyed the hierarchy that a tournament would've provided. That being said, there is a lot to like here, and a ton of entertainment value to be had. I would definitely recommend this movie to action fans, and I, for one, am looking forward to seeing this again.",Mortal Kombat

126,Jerique,Throwaway film; adds no substance to the franchise.,4,1 August 2021,"I had waited two decades for a worthy Mortal Kombat film to come out. Paul's film in 1995 was great, but the sequel almost destroyed its legacy.However, this film is not good. It opens up and does no explanation. Then a flash-forward to present time with minimal origin and story explanation and the main character is not a part of the games.Kano, is a garbage character whom is supposed to provide the bulk of comedy but the vulgarity of his lines breaks every scene he's involved in. Pop culture references to Harry Potter and other films breaks immersion and the film fails to provide realism. Even the villain character of Kabal has such vulgar lines it makes it difficult to take the character seriously.For a majority of the film, it doesn't feel like there's a tournament happening and the action sequences feel very tame. It's very much as if the characters are doing choreography and making sure not to hurt each other while doing the right moves.The rest of the film feels like the writers and producers had a list to checkmark for fans of the game. ""Get over here"" is the only English line by Scorpion in the film, and it tries to feature fatalities throughout the fight sequences. Special effects are overused as well. This definitely feels more of a commercial for the characters than a film.Overall, the pacing of the film was bad. In the first 40 minutes of the film, it seems to skip over what is happening and just get to the objective of Tsung's warriors. But for the second act and dealing with arcana's and battles, it glosses over exposition for cool effects and fatalities. For the final act of the film, it just misses on pacing once again and skips over moments that could give a lasting appeal.Mortal Kombat needed a reboot, but this wasn't the one we needed.",Mortal Kombat

The story is an explicitly horrendous train wreck.The best part of this movie was Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and as the movie went on, even Kano; these characters saved the little that was left to save in Mortal Kombat, but unfortunately, they still weren't enough to fight and win the good fight.",Mortal Kombat

The reason, however, that the saving grace belongs to the female aristocracy, is that despite the fact that the meet to meet was allowed, due to the female aristocracy's idiosyncrasy of not being a reaction to no romance despite being designed to hand out trouble when met with kindness, the boiling point used to save the woman literary agent aristocracy is replicated itself, albeit in the same territory it began.In Mortal Kombat (2021), the Woman In Blue's hot Happy Meal syndrome from Mortal Kombat Annihilation (1997) is replicated over yet different as a difference; in other words, the new replication is new.",Mortal Kombat

While I don't play much of the games, I respect it as one of the most famous game franchises. The original movie is enjoyable if cheesy (with a super catchy opening theme to boot) and there's no disagreement the sequel should go to the Netherrealm. Cut to 2021 and we got ourselves a brand new reboot. Can Raiden's lighting strike again?Plot: Former MMA champion Cole Young finds himself chosen to participate in the interdimensional tournament Mortal Kombat, the goal being to prevent Earth's invasion by the malevolent Outworld. This makes him and his family a target for assassination by the dark forces. Reluctantly, Cole joins a band of heroic fighters including Sonya Blade and Liu Kang among others, led by the thunder god Raiden. Together they must unlock their true powers in order to stand a chance against their evil counterparts.There's a large cast of characters, which is both its strength and weakness. On one hand, it allows a diverse set of fighting styles and abilities, not to mention a good-sized body count. On the other, it means some will be more developed than others and some character storylines will have to take a backseat, though this mostly falls onto the villains. Acting is a somewhat mixed; while no one is bad, some line delivery comes across as stiff while the rest is done well. The main characters are likable enough to carry the movie, faithfully adapted from the games with some going through arcs that connect with their abilities and relationships. The standout is Kano, who eats every last chunk of the scenery and provides much of the comic relief. The iconic rivalry between Scorpion and Sub-Zero is also done well with the film's opening being one of the stronger emotional scenes, leading to an excellent payoff later on. Cole Young is made exclusively for this film. Not the best protagonist, but is serviceable and acts as an audience avatar learning about MK as much as the viewer. Of course, we have numerous fight scenes spread throughout, each set in visually distinct locations. There's a superb balance of martial arts and magic, playing to the strengths of each combatant and often ending in super gory fatalities, the latter something missing from the old films. These are complemented by great special effects that blend CGI with practical elements. There's lots of fan service to go around with many callbacks to the franchise like a recreation of the theme music, classic catchphrases, and a little fun poked at spamming attacks, very few of which are intrusive. Admittedly, the first half is a little sluggish in its pacing, but afterwards it picks up nicely and ends with a bloody finale.All in all, this is an enjoyable experience. A little rough around the edges, but it's both a fun film and a faithful adaptation.",Mortal Kombat

A great adaptation of the iconic Video Game series and a fun movie with some great action and interesting new concepts added to the story. This is a movie that I enjoy just as much as the 95 version.The fight scenes and the effects are awesome and the action keeps you on the edge of your seat especially the fights with Scorpion and Sub-zero and the Goro scene with him fighting Cole Young.I also really like the idea of the Arcana and how that chooses the champions for Mortal Kombat and gives them there powers its an interesting new concept that I really like and a nice way of explaining how everyone gets there powers. I also like how it seems to adapt to the person like in the case of Jax his power adapts to his metal arms and makes them bigger.The characters are great for the most part and well adapted from the game i love what they do with Subzero and Scorpion and Kano is definitely the highlight character of the movie. The other characters all do a great job aswell for the most part and I even like Cole Young for a new character he does a good job.I also like how this is a prelude to the tournament which was an interesting choice for the story and shows the how far Outworld will go to make sure they win its an interesting idea and i like the idea of showing the build up to Mortal Kombat.The only issues i have with the movie is I feel like some of the Villains were wasted like Mileena and Reiko they are basically just there to kill and basically don't do much in the movie in my opinion and its disappointing because they are well known and ineresting characters from the game. I also feel like Cole Young although I liked him was a little generic and needs to be built more as a character hopefully he is better served in the sequel.But this is a solid movie and alot of fun for all Mortal Kombat fans if you like the games or the 95 movie you will have a blast with this one.This is a solid adaptation of a videogame in my opinion.Verdict 8.5/10 a solid adaptation of Mortal Kombat some interesting new concepts like Arcana and some solid action make this a blast.

It's just Hollywood jump cuts to one person throws a punch and the other person taking. It or throwing their own, very disjointed and uninteresting. There were ""fights"" that I couldn't follow until somebody died and I had to reflect back and convince myself that it made sense.Having said that this film feels as though it was reduced down to under 2hours on purpose, most scenes and interactions feel as though they had much more in there to flesh out the story but they were cut for whatever reasons.

The fight choreography, the camerawork and the CGI in MK'96 were all better than in this 2021 reboot. It's kind of funny.I feel like they didn't really know what or who they were trying to make this movie foe; old fans? New ones? The makers probably don't even know. The only character they got right was Kano. Scorpion being some tragic hero even though he's 'risen from Hell' and Cole was totally unnecessary. I think he was hauled out of some network exec's ass to fill the gap the lack of Johnny Cage in the first movie to justify a sequel(s).I feel like all of the creative energy was burnt out on the first scene, and from there it feel's like the Alien 3 of Reboots.

The movie has a great cast, wish to see more of them. They did a wonderful job with the fighting sequencees with special gorgeous effects. Joe Taslim did a wonderful job playing sub Zero and think he needs an award. Same for Sanada as Scorpion. Both actors really created a wonderful atmosphere for the movie fans and I hope to see them more in the sequels to come.On the other hand; the negatives... the movie's dialogues were not so great and fun, infact some were lame and uninspiring. The movie's plot didn't do a good job to attract and entice the fans either, was too simple with very few characters to explore and admire. The stunts also had some bad ones in them, the roping were very unrealistic and un-natural, wish those parts were cut out.Nonetheless though I think the movie isn't too great, it's worth a start and a prequel to awesome and broader sequels to come.

With that said, there's been far worse cases of that and nothing about this film's take had me cringing or pulling my hair out.The action is the main course and it delivers. It's an exhilarating marathon of gleefully gory martial arts mayhem and cheesy winks to the games, despite some messy editing and a few missed opportunities here and there. Personally, I prefer the 1995 film because the action, sets and effects are more authentic and there's not so much CGI in your face. However, this new film works in its own right and it's a decent diversion. Plus, it's SHORT. Hallelujah. Expect nothing more than corny blockbuster thrills. Test your might with this fun romp.",Mortal Kombat
145,aleksanderk-95350,Get Over Here!!!!!,5,24 April 2021,The highly anticipated 2021 Mortal Kombat film is here. It's what I expected lots of fighting with little plot. The effects and visuals are great in this film. The best parts of this film are the opening and closing fights. Between sub zero and scorpion. Unfortunately we get very little of scorpion in the film. Most of the screen time is filled up with boring characters like Cole Young. Who is the most generic character ever. I'm curious to see if this gets a sequel. If some of the well known characters. Will return even though they died.,Mortal Kombat

Maybe this was a prequel to the original MK movie. I had just finished watching Wu Assassins, that has Lewis Tan in it, and was surprised me to see him in this. His character (Cole) seemed to be the main lead, but... I don't know, it was like unfinished, I couldn't get his character or even his power.

But the cheesiness is inherent to the source material, and the FX are passable for the time. Plus, I was a kid when it came out so it's close to my heart. Enough about that one, though. This installment/reboot was excellent fun, especially the R-rated (the original was PG-13) fatalities. Everybody loves Kano but I thought his humor was a bit too constant and in-your-face/annoying. Not all, but some of it. I really did relish that they humanized Scorpion and Subzero as characters with backstories, more so than the foreground protagonists. My only gripe is Mileena - they gave her teeth but not the iconic Mileena jaw until the last 5 seconds (no exaggeration) of her screen time. I can let it go, though, in hopes that a sequel (and c'mon, they're DEFINITELY gonna make this a franchise) will resurrect some of the fallen characters and one-up their appearances/capabilities.

As a Mortal Kombat fan since 1992 I felt very satisfied with the nostalgia and the obvious care they put into this film to make it authentic.The Scorpion and Sub Zero story line was very impressive. The beginning of the movie was flawless. The new character Cole was fine. I found his power a little lame, but his bloodline story was really cool.Now, to compare it to the 1995 Mortal Kombat. Shang Tsung in the '95 film was so much better. But other than the classic techno theme song, this new one was much improved in almost every other way.

Thanks for the good looking view! Hot as fire my respect to those gods, I literally fell in love with those 4, even if that seems impossible!

BAD POINTS:
Where was Kitana?? It's a classic characterWho was Reiko??? He's none of the classic games(only played the first 3, the last ones are an insult to these classics and has nothing to do with MK)Why Mileena had a dirty face? Where was her mask and her classic epic outfit?Where were Mileena's powers?Why the 90's films had better special effects than this movie that is literally made in a time where special effects can be 100% realistic?Why there wasnt a Mortal Kombat if the movie is called Mortal Kombat??Super funny the creators of this parody!!!

155,arabnikita,Exactly what fans of MK wanted for all these years,8,8 April 2021,"Video game movie curse is over! What's more, we can finally forget the nightmare of the old Mortal Kombat cringefest with horrendous graphics and awful acting. This film was made primarily for the OG fans of the games and they will not be disappointed. The characters, the dialogue and the inhuman level of violence is all done in the best standards of the genre with special effects leaving little to be desired. In case you are not familiar with the games, don't worry because the action will leave you satisfied.Starting off with a tragic prologue about the franchise's most iconic characters Scorpion and Sub Zero, the movie shows that it's not here to mess around. I was worried that the story will be all over the place but they managed to give adequate time for everyone's development while keeping it engaging the entire time. Nothing too original as the main focus was to set up the characters and make sure the fans got a proper MK treatment. The spot-on casting nailed everyone's appearance and the personalities energized this dark themed film. The biggest surprise by far was the humor of this film as I certainly didn't expect Kano to be the wisecracking joker.Half of the dialogue is composed of game quotes that are made more impactful by the constant presence of gimmicks that will make you laugh at one moment and fill you with adrenaline during the next. If you are wondering about fight and fatalities in particular; they are left, right, center and through the body. Some of the acting does feel cringy and the editing is occasionally choppy but otherwise nothing to pick on. Mortal Kombat is a promising start to what can become an entertaining franchise.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and Tv shows.",Mortal Kombat

159,BrickNash,"One or two good action scenes, but ultimately amateurish and boring",3,26 April 2021,"You can tell that this is a first time gig from the writer and director, as the film is horribly unbalanced. All the good ideas are poured into just one or two characters leaving the rest of the movie feeling pale and neglected.The addition of Cole was a huge mistake as he is just a boring character, and the part would have been better suited to Liu Kang or a young Johnny Cage. The dialogue is awful and unnatural, and nothing really feels together in the movie, which is basically a series of uninteresting events which don't grab the attention. The addition of magic tattoos and ""arcana"" was phenomenally silly and felt like it was an idea by a 12 year old.The film does do a few things very well though - namely Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Kano. All three of them get the best action scenes and the best lines, but unfortunately when they aren't on screen it's just a dull slog which feels like a fan film or webisode. Sonya and Jax are fine, but they are kind of surpluses to the events.The really crux comes when we meet Raiden, Kung-Lao, and Liu Kang. The film makers manged to make all of them - particularly Raiden - completely unlikable, and the actors portraying them are terrible and really hammy.The fights look well choreographed, but the editing is so annoying with the quick cuts that it robs the combat of any momentum, and for a film about martial arts, there's really not that much fighting in it. Even the gore is limited to just a few bits, so the action is by and large very PG-13 for the majority.To summarise - a strong opening and a few cool action & comedy bits isn't enough to save what is really a very amateurish and boring film.",Mortal Kombat

165,hoernkeem,"Mortal Kombat review(2021, Simon McQuoid) They get the violence right but surround it with a ridiculous plot",3,28 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat (2021, Simon McQuoid)
'Mortal Kombat' becomes the lates in the high profile films of 2021 being released on HBOmax on the same day that they drop in theaters. I am in no way any kind of Mortal Kombat aficionado. I played the game a bit when I was younger and have no real memory of the 90's adaptation therefore I do not take any fanboy sensibility into this review although I do recognize some of the characters and the catchphrases from the game sprinkled throughout. This is director McQuoid's feature debut and he certain gets to play with some toys as this is a heavily effects based martial arts film. I feel like they tried too hard to construct a plot around the characters and concept of the game although it still comes across like a half hearted effort as far as script and plot go. This is a solid R rated film which allows them to fill the movie with some gratuitous violence and bloodletting which is in keeping with the harsh uberviolent nature of the video game which caused a sensation when it was first released.The plot sets up a classic hero's journey in the form of Cole Hanzo who is not a character from the game I believe. He is a faltering mixed martial artist but quickly learns that he is descended from an elite fighting ancestor and he has been selected for a supernatural tournament where no less than the fate of Earth hangs in the balance. Earth's champions are all identified by distinctive dragon marks. The beings of what is known as Outworld have their own champions primary among them being an otherworldly entity known as Sub-Zero. Like I said the plot here is thin yet overly convoluted. It actually would have been better to attempt less plot to just get to the fighting. I will give them credit for gore though. They had an R rating and they wielded it with a reckless abandon. The first fight involves a thrilling battle as our protagonist, Cole Hanzo's, ancestor whips around a blade tied to a rope wasting bad guys left and right. Another standout scene is one where Sub-Zero utilizes his freeze powers in a battle to amazing effect. It is a very cool scene where even his blood becomes a weapon. Our hero, who is initially beset by self doubt, finds his strength, channels the power of his ancestors and with the help of the other champions of Earth defeats the evil Outworlders. One of the oddities of the narrative is that there was supposed to be this big tournament known as Mortal Kombat, but the Outworlders were trying to cheat by killing Earth's champions so we never even got to the tournament. It was kind of an odd way to take the story, but I think they just didn't want to do a basic fighting tournament story.The special effects and the fighting make, for the most part, this movie an entertaining watch. The plot is just a cobbled together mush to give the character's excuses for fighting. The shame is that they actually seemed to try to put together this plot and storyline and it winds up being silly and ultimately the downfall of the film. You don't get invested in any of the character's despite the film imploring you to, and even the tease at the end of assembling a new group of champions including Johnny Cage only really causes a smirk rather than generate any kind of genuine excitement for a sequel. This film isn't awful, but it is far from good. Ultimately this may be destined to be one of those cult style faves beloved by a few and chided by many. I enjoyed a few of the fight scenes and appreciated the R rating but was hoping for much better than what was delivered.Eric's Grade: D+",Mortal Kombat

174,chandean-69762,Mortal Kombat 2021 Review,7,23 April 2021,"""The fate of Earth is in our hands.""
I had high expectations going in to this film and I left decently satisfied.It's obvious they wanted to put this out to start a movie franchise, especially now knowing that Joe Taslim, the actor for Sub-Zero, said he's already signed on for four more Mortal Kombat films.I feel like this is a good launching point, but I can't help but feel a little bit of distaste specifically with the ending because of the ""sequel set-up"" treatment.Mortal Kombat, this time around, brought a well needed R-Rating and it delivers on that rating too.The fights scenes are impactful, bloody, and well choreographed, there's even a super brutal fatality that I was ecstatic to see come to the big screen.However, I feel like the editing of this film hurts it a lot, it's extremely hit or miss especially with the fight sequences.There's a sequence when 5 fights are going on at once in two different locations and they constantly switch from fight to fight and location to location and it becomes jarring super fast.The editing outside of the fights wasn't the greatest either, it's definitely this films weakest link.Cole Young as our protagonist was a welcome addition to the Mortal Kombat franchise but his character seemed too shrouded in mystery the entire film for little pay off. I'm still asking myself questions about his character.Everyone else was decently good, the casting for Kano (Josh Lawson) and Kung Lao (Max Huang) was perfect in my opinion, I enjoyed their characters the most.All in all, Mortal Kombat was more serious when compared to the corny campiness of the previous two films. It's overall decent, it didn't blow me away like I was hoping it would, but it did have some good action and characters, it just got weighed down by some poor editing. There's even some slight references and little easter eggs scattered throughout the film that i'm sure hardcore Mortal Kombat fans will love.A good launching point for the franchise if they do decide to continue it.",Mortal Kombat

176,theredsky,Mortal Kombat Review,3,29 April 2021,"Maybe it's because I never grew up with the games that I didn't like this but I feel that even if I did, I wouldn't like this movie. This film's big issue is that it really didn't do anything to keep me interested. I found myself dozing off at points and having to rewind a couple times because I would miss something. I also just didn't really care about the characters that much. Even if you have played the games, a lot of these characters aren't given arcs and the ones that do have one, their conclusions don't feel satisfying. The only thing that really kept me going was the fight scenes but it wasn't because the choreography was cool, it was because I liked the use of blood. The Mortal Kombat games are very violent and this film keeps that element. The film is pretty brutal at points and I enjoyed that but nothing else stood out. The fight scene at the beginning was cool but I don't remember any of the other fight scenes after that. A lot of them feel like they mesh together and don't have a big impact on the overall story. The film is bland looking. Nothing about the cinematography or the lighting really caught my eye. I did like some of the production design though. The sets for some of the fight scenes look cool at points and I kinda liked the guy with the metal arms. That's really about it.

Shang T-Sung is killing off those who will fight in the Mortal Kombat tournament for Earth.... and we get no tournament??? Really?The introduction to these characters is bad, and the villains are introduced so badly they belong in Mortal Kombat: Anhilation. Yes. Its that Bad! Shang T-Sung literally says each of his henchman names so the audience knows who they are... all located on a terrible bridge of some sort.The movie becomes a train wreck with just about every decision it makes.

Hilarious!The major issues with the film in summary are: there is no tournament, just scuffles leading up to the tournament which in the end doesn't even happen, the dialogue is just dreadful...and I mean awful, 13yr old drama students could write better stuff! (Apart from Kano's dialogue which is gold!), the acting is very hit and miss with some performers really not delivering at all, and lastly the plot is so shallow and superficial. (I'm still not sure what point of the story is anyway).In saying that, the fighting is good fun and enjoyable to watch, and the film makers have done their research on the games with some great character introductions and references to the game itself.Not one to watch if you need to think but great if you need something to zone out to or have on in the background.",Mortal Kombat

Kano says the 'f' word as filler when he's having trouble doing the comic relief. This can be summed up as follows: X-men meets Transformers meets the plot elements of Mortal Kombat, with added fireworks! It doesn't even feel like Mortal Kombat at all. There is no peril in this movie, it is entirely predictable. The only part that approached interesting was the beginning, which starts as an origin story for Sub-Zero and Scorpion.

181,ssvfolder-1,"Movie is a show, and a show is exactly what you get",7,24 April 2021,"Let me start with saying that the prologue and introduction of Scorpion and Sub zero are one of the best I've ever seen. It was superb and perfect in almost every way. It set the tone for the rest of the movie, but obviously the rest couldn't match up the first 10 minutes of the movie. Never the less the movie gives you exactly what to expect from all the fighting games and it's awesome.I got the feeling that the creators spent too much money and effort into the prologue and realized that there won't be enough budget to follow up on that tone, so they've decided to cut costs on the decorations and focus on a fighting sequences, which was a smart move considering it's a movie after a fighting game, and what a sequences we've got. I can honestly say that they are one of the best ever! The same gore we love in MK games we saw perfectly portrayed in the movie. Actors they are not, but fighters they are. We wanted a show and we've got one!Now as a MK series fan I'd like to go into small characters details, comparing them to the games and 1995 movie classic.Sub Zero & Scorpion - Perfect! Couldn't be done better. Though they didn't show the scorpions teleportation abilities and Sub-Zero's glide, they've still shown a lot of moves from the games. 2 points to 2021 version.Raiden. In all honesty he doesn't strike you as a all powerful lightning god in thins one. I got the feeling he acted more like insure grocery seller, that can't protect his own. Even by movie logic, he can get involved should the outworld break the rules. Point to 1995 version.Sonya Blade. Much much better in 2021 version, though unfortunately some of her moves with legs are missing from the sequences. They replaced it with a knife play which was a good replacement. Point to 2021.Kano. No comparison there. 2021 version is witty, true sell-sword and does his awesome fatality on reptile. Nice! Another point to 2021.Liu Kang. 1995 version and games show Liu Kang as a light side protagonist. Insanely powerful fighter that was destined to best Shang Tsung. 2021 shows him as quite weak and in all honesty he talked too much. Point to 1995.Shang Tsung. 1995 version was simply better due to almost perfect casting. Point to 1995 version.Goro. As 2021 version invested so much more into fighting sequences and special effects made a huge step to a different level than almost 30 years ago, nod to 2021.Reptile. 2021 version was different than shown in games yet once again as in case of Goro, it was much better than 1995 version. Point to 2021.Decorations. As mentioned earlier 2021 version had abandoned it almost completely, except the prologue, therefore point to 1995.Fighting sequences and fatalities. Clear and obvious winner in 2021. One of the best ever. 2 points to 2021.Music. Very few soundtracks that became as iconic to the techno style of 1995. Point to 1995.Additional and new characters. 1995 version had Johnny Cage and Kitana. 2021 version had Kung Lao, Mileena. Jax, Kabal and Nitara. It also had a new character that did not appear in games - Cole Young. I did not like how a new character broke a bit MK strength rankings, but I need to give this one to 2021 version, as Kung Lao and Jax were awesome, though a bit arrogant.So to conclude it's 9 points for 2021 and 5 points for 1995.We want more of the same and triple the budget, so we'd get and entire movie with a prologue quality. This will be a masterpiece! Worth every minute.",Mortal Kombat
182,scottmannen1,Terrible! There are so many Good Reviews for a Terrible Film!,4,24 April 2021,I am sure there must be tons of kids giving this bad film a good review. It has a ton of actors no one has EVER seen before. Their acting skills are bad. The Plot is awful and the fighting and effects aren't that great either! 4/10.,Mortal Kombat
183,ravenhair702,Awesome movie! much better than it's last try...,9,25 April 2021,"I went with my brother to go see Mortal Kombat today and it was fantastic! It's rated R for a reason, though. WAY too many F-bombs in this movie and I saw a lot of kids brought into this movie with their parents. I guess it will be their fault if they start talking like that, but I digress. The story was excellent and the special effects were amazing. Kano was the funniest of the characters and the guy who played sub-zero was very good at drawing out my hate for his character. He plays a villain VERY well. I'm guessing that there will be a sequel from the ending. I just hope that if they do another movie, it won't be a complete abortion like 1997 Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. IMDB rating? 3.7. SUPER TERRIBLE. Loved this movie, though. Go watch it, but leave the kids at home. Peace.",Mortal Kombat

Kano was a funny character. He steals the show.Music was very disappointing. You could hear the beats but it's semi. Ugh without those beats and rhythm, it felt blah!I love the fatalities.

A ""gore-fest"" action movie that's boring. How great is that?There is nothing about this movie that I can take away positively. The story was underwhelming, the dialogues were exposition dumps with no real reason, the acting was painfully bad (especially the actor playing Lord Rayden), the dialogue deliveries were flat, the action scenes were dull, the gore had all the fun stripped out of it, the VFX was not that great and lastly the iconic MK theme song was just straight up butchered into this lifeless version of itself.Not worth watching at all.",Mortal Kombat

Kano is outstanding and you just cant hate him in the film.Sub zero is portrayed well same with jax and especially scorpion.It has been hinted and left open for a sequel, and yes this film does need quite a bit of work done on it. But they have a good chance with how well this first outing has been done.I fully expect a lot more characters in sequel especially with Johnny cage.Overall Mortal kombat is a brilliant example of when people who care about a game, turn it into a film.Fatalitie, flawless victory.",Mortal Kombat
191,jindann,average movie,5,24 April 2021,"Pretty average movie, that has a predictably mediocre story. The actions are acceptable and tightly packed, CG is decent enough but lacks the gore that was in the game. However the overall acting is rather stiff and dialogues are fairly silly, and while the opening is nice the ending is somewhat unsatisfying, and has rooms for improvement with a better directing and polishing. Also the characters from the old movie has better resemblance to those in game than the new remake, and those in the new movie are kind of weak and lack of charisma.",Mortal Kombat
192,tresm87,"As a fan of the game since 1992, this second attempt at a proper adaptation is more like a babality than a fatality.",6,15 April 2021,"Honestly I'm a huge fan of the 1995 film and consider it wildly underrated. It brought the game to life with sensational practical effects, supreme casting, and amazing fights. I'm not just saying this because of nostalgia bias. I truly believe it's one of the better video game adaptations.This new film is all glitz and glamour with Oversaturated CGI barraged at the audience to the point where you might as well be playing the newest MK games instead. The visuals are executed fine with immaculate color and detail but something still doesn't seem legitimate.The biggest problem is the cast imo. Yes they did cast a handful of actual martial artist actors, but when most of it is covered in CGI that aspect really doesn't seem to matter. They could've used a few bigger names as well and the inclusion of probably a top six character if the franchise. Still have no idea why they decided to not include him in a Mortal Kombat film. Aside from a few characters most of the actors gave pretty flat performances and I was never really transported into a true MK experience.The story is about as bare-bones and cliché as it gets and the stakes aren't really there. Seems very rushed or like they just wanted to focus on the CGI.I thought James Wan being attached would give us better results but unfortunately this was a very tame and watered down adaptation that can still be enjoyable at times. I say give the 1995 film another chance after watching this and realize that it's actually pretty fun and a solid imagining of the game.",Mortal Kombat

The choice of actors is neat, it could have been better, but ok, the acting is below a decent level. The fight scenes are much worse than the previous works. What can be noticed is that the action takes place extremely fast it is never good because then too much action is squeezed into a small time frame. It can be watched at without a problem but this isn't ""that"" mortal combat we're used to.",Mortal Kombat
195,thomvic,Fun overall....but not a flawless victory,7,21 April 2021,"I was so hyped when I saw the trailer when it was released. Being a fairly big fan of the games having played most of them, I had to keep my expectations in check as I knew a move adaptation based on a fighting game often doesn't translate as well on the big screen. So after viewing this at the cinema and walking out, I was pleased overall but still had some gripes with it.I know this movie was to set up the lore and mythology around the mortal kombat universe and I knew there would be no tournament and that didn't bother me. However the plotline with the dragon marking making you a chosen warrior of Earthrealm (Earth essentially) didn't sit well with me for one reason: if you kill a champion with the mark, the mark gets transferred to the killer. So one of the main characters Sonya (who is one of the original 3 champions) doesn't have a marking in this movie. That didn't bother me initially as I thought she would prove that she didn't need a marking to be a worthwhile champion, but instead she ends up killing another champion, then gets the mark and develops her power. It would have been a lot better had she proven herself, then essentially earnt the mark to prove that she was equal amongst all others who had it. Does this mean if someone on the street accidentally shot a champion, they would have no choice but to be a champion in the Mortal Kombat tournament? Sorry mate, you got more than you bargained for.Aside from that, the beginning of the film was really well done with the set up of the conflict between Hanzo Hasashi and Bihan, who would eventually become Scorpion and Sub Zero. It was well shot and had a good pace, which the rest of the film sometimes went astray.The fight scenes were fine, though I think some of them were edited with to many shots and wasn't as smooth as it could have been.In terms of the characters, Kano is a standout who provided the comedy. The actors who played Sub Zero, Scorpion and Sonya were my favourites. The actor who played Shang Tsung, who is meant to be the feared leader, could have done a better job and he didn't come off as very threatening or intimidating.The third act also felt a big rushed with the final fights for some of the characters so it kind of felt like they couldn't quite work out how to make the final battles more impactful.Hopefully if sequels get made (or a Netflix tv series perhaps, which I think would be better to explore the mortal kombat universe and lore) they can help the franchise move in a more grounded direction. So overall, I enjoyed it but still left me wanting more from it.",Mortal Kombat
196,mr-altex,Going full cringe would be more entertaining,4,24 April 2021,"I've said it! There are various aspects of this movie that making it a bad entertainment.First. For anyone who watched Deadpool 2 , Lewis Tan is a Shatterstar, the little bit more gay useless superhero. That same goes to his acting skills. Every scene where he is and where it is supposed to be a dramatic moment is worth skipping.The first combat scenes with Hiroyuki Sanada and Joe Taslim had some good direction, not the usual every blow = cut type of shooting. Unfortunately that's about the highlight of the movie when it comes to action.The only entertaining characters are Kano and Kung Pao, because nothing they do seems to be meant seriously and Liu Kang, because of cringeworthy performance of overreacting and overplaying every moment :DIf the movie would take itself less seriously and went full cringe it would be definitely better entertainment.",Mortal Kombat
197,talllwoood13,Babality,4,7 July 2021,"The CGI and special effects look great but is this movie ever poorly cast, Except maybe Sonya Blade and Jax the actors hardly look like most of the characters. Especially Raiden and Mileena as Mileena is not black (or black looking) though I haven't played the last few games. Kano pretty much kept this movie from being dull. They are trying way too hard to be funny and entertaining like a crappy guardians of the galaxy or that awful dragon ball z movie. Humor is great every movie can use a bit but it just comes off as a kiddy ""believe in yourself"" or ""never give up"" movies or one of those find their true powers and they save the world at the end with these newly found powers. But as we know instead.. boom! Scorpion appears, no lessons are learned! Scorpion is like a participation trophy at best. It's like the director or producers know this movie their target audience is mostly going to be edgy 12 year olds will sneak and watch this on their phones. I kind of admire but find it annoying with the ""flawless victory"" and all the nods to the game such as mentioning ""test your might"".The actors for the most part act fine and surely look better than the dragon ball Z movie but they should have found actors that looked similar to the video game characters. I'm just glad Rhonda Rousey isn't Sonya Blade. I think the movie should have been darker in atmosphere. It was brutal when it needed to be I'll admit because that Kung Lao fatality involving his hat was great. 3/4 of the way into the movie they all magically start getting their powers so the pacing was just awful. I'm going to use another dragon ball reference. Remember how long it took Vegeta to turn super saiyan? Goku got it in Namek yet Vegeta was angry, he wanted it so badly. Imagine how dull or pointless it would have been if 5 seconds later Vegeta says oh look I'm a super saiyan too. The end of the movie when Sub zero fights scorpion who appears out of nowhere was a really REALLY dumb idea and they really heavily abused the ""Get over here"" spear thing. A few times is great but kind of like if a band played 9 encores eventually even the most hardcore fans will leave. The ending could have used some work it's like they were going over budget. I know they couldn't have killed Shang Tsung and I always felt Sub Zero was a good guy (yes there's 2). However I do admire at least once they fought in an area that remotely looked like it belongs in the video game. However like I've said in the beginner of the review the pay off for scorpions ancestor. Mr. Gold armor.. whoever he was (I'm too lazy to google it) he doesn't even defeat sub zero. He just gets his who knows how many greats grandfather to do it. As if he did that journey for nothing. The final bit of the plot just seemed like that last mission in GTA 5 where they all go after someone else and oh goodie! A sequel! Please PLEASE get better writers who understand some of the fan base is in their 30s or 40s. I'll admit this is more than likely better than how I remember the first two movies especially the ""YOU.. WILL.. DIE!"" everyone brainlessly spews. Maybe if this came out instead almost 30 years ago it would have done better but I really feel Warner Brothers or someone else was to blame for this borderline cheesy kids movie feel to it.So ways to improve, less childish, more darker atmosphere, not everything has to be a comedy, re-cast almost everyone and give the special effects team a raise! They were what kept this extremely watered down tale from being boring.",Mortal Kombat
198,mochteam,As close as it's going to get for now...,7,10 November 2021,"The original MK movies were corny and lacked the violence of the games. This movie was a lot more on par with the games and they had the right races to play the characters this time so that was a BIG improvement.The story though seemed to fall off in the 4th act for me. It rushed to an ending without the same attention to detail in character development. It felt like it was a movie that should have been told in 2 parts but the film company didn't know if there would be a sequel or not so they just stuffed it all into one movie.Problems as a long time fan of the game since it debuted when I was a kid is the story line. Mortal Kombat was basically ""Enter the Dragon"" the video game but over the years the plot just got crazier and crazier and so did the characters and fatalities.I could imagine a movie based on the game at this point being confusing or difficult to do with so many different storylines they could follow but they made a new character named Cole just for the movie? Which was strange and unfamiliar as all the existing characters already have great back stories.I was excited to see some characters but also kind of disappointed that so many fan favorites and classic characters were missing from the film and they got reptile really wrong. I do admire the original movies of Mortal Kombat because they had pretty much all the characters from the games in them. Even if they were cheesy they had peoples favorite characters in them. That's important because literally everyone has a favorite character they played as a kid. You got to have them ALL in your movie. The first 2 movies did that well and that's what this version of MK is missing.Even though those early movies lacked the violence and seriousness they were true to the game in that regard. You got to see your favorite character on the big screen.I'm sure they'll take the criticism from fans and make the sequel better and add in more characters.",Mortal Kombat

So these are things that went right.Compared to the previous movies that have cult following, this one's the character design is great. It's nothing ground breaking but it's very good.Corny low budget laugh out loud VFX is gone. The CG and practical effects are pretty good.Acting is acceptable. Jax and specially Kano really really stand out.For a video game movie which has low bar, this has a pretty cohesive, no time waste plot and that's something.They make good use of the R rating.Fight choreography and stunt work is pretty great.For the things that don't work.Lead character is a new addition to the team and is very bland. I did not enjoy his story at all. I don't like when hero's are passed down powers then they push a few buttons to get some awesome super powers.There is a very much loved character which is pretty non existent in the movie and the trailer had advertised hell out of it.The fight choreography is great but for some reason they chose to do that fast cut and edit style. I wanna meet and KO the guy who is telling them that audience love Jason Bourne style fast past cut cut cut fight scenes.

With better editing and some minor changes it would have been a solid 7.This had alot of potential, but ebcause of bad editing (seems like a re.-edit possibly that ruined the initial edit?, or re-edit for a possible sequel - aka to save some shot material?) it falls apart more than a few times. The CGI isnt top notch aswell. I had hoped for a more huamn version with the nice landscape shots that can be seen but are too far and not well enough phased in. While downplaying most effects to emphasize those of the warriors (which was also done).So to the good parts; they got Sub zero right (even though humanising him wasn't the richt choice imo). They got Kano (also his eye) and Kung Lao right, aswell as the fire and purple effect. Scorpion's effect not so much. The trailer also milked the one moment they really nailed down.They got the panoramic views somewhat right, maybe some greenscreen work and ruined cities could have been added if budget allowed it.For me overall this seems like they were doing a good product and then got rushed to finish it, with a second editor isntead of increased budget and the result suffered.

So I'm judging this as a movie, and well... it's ok I guess. There are lots to love about this film, for starters, the production design in amazing, especially during the first 10 minutes. Hiroyuki Sanada nails it as Scorpion, but we don't see enough of him. In fact, most of the actors do a good job here, with the standout being Joshua Lawson as Kano.The story is bland and predictable, and the screenplay is poor, but on the flip side, I doubt people came to watch Mortal Kombat for the story, they came for the fight scenes - and this film surely delievers on that. I wasn't over fond of the music, at times it was so loud I could barely here the actors on screen speaking. But that is no fault of the composer, there are great instances where the music plays over well done action scenes.The action is very well done, the choreography is outstanding in some parts. You can tell the director is a big fan of old school martial arts films.Mortal Kombat is average, not awful like that Monster Hunter movie that came out, but not as good as Detective Pikachu.

So with this film I was hoping it would be better than the original and the animation (Scorpion's Revenge). And after watching it twice on both Theater and HBO Max. I like it... but sadly I didn't love it. Some fans wanted lore and other gore. I wanted both of them. The film does a lot of things right. The fighting and the gore, fatalities, brutalities, and acting were all on point. Such as Kano; it's true what they said about him he was hilarious and I saw Kano not Josh Lawson by far he did a phenomenal job at the role. And the negatives are yes quite a lot. The lore was too quick it's a prequel; OK... I like it. But the story felt too quick to process and which characters I need to grow didn't I feel like they cut out the most important parts of the film. And some characters died too early in the films, where I wanted to see Kung Lao, Kabal, Nitara, Mileena, and Goro, they died in this film and that means we won't see them again after this. (I hope they come back). I wanted more from these characters I knew it would be a hard task, And I wish we got more of it. Sadly they didn't deliver on this. And Cole Young... He was ok I guess, his powers though were awful. I wish we saw more of him and his fighting abilities and I wish I saw more of his character with his wife and daughter.

211,garethvk,Mortal Kombat Gives Fans Of The Franchise The Brutal Live-Action Version They Deserve,7,22 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat Gives Fans Of The Franchise The Brutal Live-Action Version They Deserve
Fans of the Mortal Kombat series have known that the path to bringing the violent and controversial game to live-action formats has been a mixed bag. While the first film in 1995 was a decent hit; the follow-up in 1997 disappointed fans who had grown weary of the PG-13 take on the series.Subsequent efforts such as the 2011 television series also left fans wanting more; especially since the game series had become even more graphic and violent.An animated film released in 2020 gave fans a taste of what they wanted as it featured graphical violence which many fans believed was essential to properly catch the spirit and action of the series.The latest offering in the series ""Mortal Kombat""; reboots the cinematic universe and gives fans the intense, brutal, and graphic violence that they have demanded. The film keeps the basic premise that the Outworld realm has won nine tournaments in a row, and based on the ancient laws; one more victory would allow them to take control of the Earth.Raiden the Thunder God (Tadanobu Asano); who has been tasked with protecting Earth looks to assemble and train a band of champions to save Earth. Naturally, this is not going to be easy as Shang Tsung (Chin Han); is not willing to follow the rules of the tournament and dispatches his top fighter (Sub Zero (Joe Taslim) to dispatch the champions of Earth before the tournament in a clear violation of the rules in order to ensure total victory.What follows is solid and very graphic action which contains gore and brutality on a level that almost kept the film from earning an R-rating. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there were some great recreations of classic moves by characters from the game series which were really well utilized and did not seem like gratuitous pandering.While the plot is fairly simplistic and does not deviate greatly from the source material; it does give a larger backstory to the universe. It was really enjoyable to see many nods to the franchise throughout both subtle and overt and while some characters were glaringly absent which was a surprise; the characters that were included were really solid to see and the door was wide open for their inclusion at a later date.While the cast does not contain any star power in terms of what Western audiences might expect from a major studio release; the ensemble works well and do a great job in bringing their characters to life.The film leaves sequels wide open and teases a character that in my opinion was a glaring omission from the film. That being said; ""Mortal Kombat"" gives fans a solid adaptation that does not shy away from gore and violence and gives fans the cinematic experience that they have wanted.3.5 stars out of 5.",Mortal Kombat

Sadly this character chose like the first the wrong female to play it as she can not pull that role off. Both Sonya's are irritating and would be smashed by anyone.- failed badly in that respect.Watch this movie while you're trying to think how to get out of debt or how to get a better paying job and then it'll pass by nicely.,Mortal Kombat
215,stephenstephenbyrne,Fatality,5,27 May 2021,"Well, it was certainly an MK movie, for better or worse. The script was kinda lame and the fight scenes were a bit stiff but I was weirdly okay with that given the source material. The real fatality for this movie is its choice of main protagonist and the story it chooses to tell.The whole 'clueless new character as a conduit for the audience' shtick really backfires here. He's so unbelievably boring, you will find yourself relishing every moment this guy isn't on screen. His power is LITERALLY plot armour mixed with a comeback mechanic. I died. They really should have just stuck with the story of Scorpion and Sub-Zero.",Mortal Kombat
216,drawlife,It's got potential.,6,26 April 2021,"I'll get straight to the point, the film has weak dialog, some wooden/mediocre performances, and somewhat choppy editing. BUT, I see potential, A LOT of potential. It's a good shut your brain off and enjoy kind of film.I will admit, I'm not a MORTAL KOMBAT diehard, I actually was a TEKKEN kid, but I did grow up playing MORTAL KOMBAT here and there so I am familiar with the game and it's characters. I bring up characters cause the lead of the film is Cole Young played by Lewis Tan. He has moments of dry delivery, but I didn't think he was awful for a new character for the film. He did the best he could and I found his abilities to be kinda cool really. Even though there are plenty of characters they could have chosen for a primary protagonist, I understand why they chose to create a new character for the film as he doesn't carry any expectations that won't be met say if they chose Liu Kang or Kung Lao or Sonya Blade. So I get it, and at the very least he wasn't as awful as Alice from the RESIDENT EVIL franchise, who is also a brand new character for the film.As for the rest of the cast, aside from some bland performances, they all did fairly alright. Nothing was too too corny or awful, but the clear MVP in the acting category is Josh Lawson as Kano. He provided a lot of comedic relief and provided the best dialog in what is a movie filled with ""meh"" dialog. Hiroyuki Sanada and Joe Taslim both portray Scorpion and Sub-Zero very well. As seen in the trailers they both clearly have the best fights in the film. Also dug Max Huang and Ludi Lin as Kung Lao and Liu Kang. I was extremely bummed to see Huang's Kung Lao get killed off, despite his moments where he shined.Fights were great, fatalities were AWESOME and didn't hold back on the blood and gore. Loved every minute of it particularly the opening fight, Kung Lao's fatality, and Cole's finish with Goro. It is heavy R, loaded with fan service here and there and I suspect the casual fans and diehard fans would not complain about that end of the spectrum. I certainly didn't.Again, I do see a lot of potential should the film do well enough to warrant a sequel. I think if they had a bigger budget they definitely could have amped up the VFX, fights and scenery. Should this be successful I would think they can take it to another level with the right people behind the scenes and really start an actual tournament in the film. The film ends in which where Johnny Cage will absolutely show up, and although it is very unlikely I personally can see any of the Hollywood Chris' play the role, specifically Chris Evans.I know diehards love the first 90's film, but honestly, for me it just never held up and it's pretty awful. This is clearly the best live action adaptation of the game, which I understand that's not high praise when almost every video game film adaptation has been awful, but I do think WB and the filmmakers have something good in their hands.6/10.",Mortal Kombat
217,tvdefrancesco,I Don't Know Why People are Hating on This Movie,9,29 April 2021,I thought this movie was done really well. Much better than its predecessors. I played the video game when I was kid. Enough to remember most of the characters but I wouldn't say I'm a diehard fan. I thought the guy who played Sub Zero was dope. I wish they showed more of Outerworld and the bridge between the opening scene and 400 years later. Especially learning about Bihans transition to Sub Zero over that period of time and Scorpion in hell. But there's definitely going to be a sequel so hopefully we'll get it in the next film. GodFather 2 style.The beginning scene was the best in the movie. Overall I liked it. With every movie so political these days it's nice to watch a movie where I can kick back and enjoy.

I think the tone was just right, with the movie playing it straight but also acknowledging the silliness. Kano was absolutely hilarious and stole the show. Sub Zero and Scorpion were done better than I have ever seen them before. Seriously. I would not change their depiction at all. The fight scenes weren't anything to write home about...but the fatalities were generally awesome and ilicited the ""ohhhhhsss"" you would expect. I also thought the casting was pretty spot on and they managed to capture the essence of each character quite well. I legitimately enjoyed a lot of these characters and wanted to see more.The Bad: I sorta respect that this movie decided to go with a new protagonist (not from the games), but...he was pretty boring. I also thought the fight scenes could have been filmed a bit better (although, let's be honest, even at it's best Mortal Kombat is mostly button mashing). The worst thing for me was the ending. It felt super abrupt and as if we didn't actually get a sense of what this universe's Mortal Kombat tournament really entailed. It leaves you hanging.The Ugly: quick editing needs to die. Seriously. Please stop cutting. Unless it's via spinning razor hat or big sword. That's fine.",Mortal Kombat

I waited to hear it and was so disappointed *insert thug tear here*Moving on, I thought the movie was solid!! Seeing some of my faves (like Scorpion, Raiden and Sub-Zero) took me back to my youth when I spent hours playing Mortal Kombat, trying to hit fatalities on the wretched Sega controller. It's gory and now that I'm a bit older it can be hard to watch but I knew what to expect going in. All in all MK had great fight scenes, so-so character development and tons of nostalgia.

222,impressivesgirl-37857,Thankfully I didn't pay to see this,5,24 April 2021,"Is this a parody or something? Why is everyone speaking in a ghetto slang or using to much swear words? It is filled with stupid dialogues (especially Kano) with cliche phrases, used in every cheap action movie ever. The actors cannot act at all and the script is generally bad. And where is the awesome theme song? From the beginning you can see the cheap visuals and effects (in the Prince Goro fighting scene with the very poorly made blood - basically the blood in every scene). To me this movie was full of plot holes or just bad writing in general. For example how is Cole a father of a 13ish year old daughter when he looks 27? Obviously they chose this actor only for the looks. Why did he leave his family in the car to go see Sonya and then completely left them to find a magical temple? Btw the actress that plays Sonya is so blah and Americana looking - no bad ass vibes from her. I cannot understand where the budget went. Definitely one of the biggest disappointments of the year. One plus tho - this story is better than the 1995 version and the Scorpion/Sub-Zero duo is better executed, costume and character.",Mortal Kombat
223,HanShotFirstGR,It was nice for what it wanted to be!,6,14 May 2021,"Plot:MMA fighter Cole Young seeks out Earth's greatest champions in order to stand against the enemies of Outworld in a high stakes battle for the universe.Analysis:I had never been a fan of this game yet I was pretty hyped for this, the trailer showed something cruel and not at all ridiculous and the cast was really promising so I waited a long time to watch this. Certain parts of the film were quite nice and proved that Video Game movies can be good sometimes, but there were also some stuff that could be significantly better.The action was the main focus of the movie. When you adapt a fighting video game, it's only logical to have the action on point and to be fair the choreography standards were pretty high, the actors were skilled, their fights were brutal and had a nice tempo and this was a huge opportunity to make an action movie to remember. And that's were editing does more harm than good. When the viewer can't watch the hits on a fight he can't be invested in it, too many cuts, too many weird changes of angle and a filming style that actually undermines the whole result. Most of the battles were created in that style and that was a huge let down, thankfully the last battle was clearer and had quite a lot of surprises to at least end with a banger.It was pretty obvious from the beginning that the story would not be anything memorable. A simple plot, no big plotlines or character arcs, they kept it simple and somewhat enjoyable as it helps the movie to be a fun no-brainer. Even when you shut your brain down, this movie has no characters and a silly plot, you won't be pissed off but even as a low quality form of entertainment don't seak for something interesting in the screenplay.As of visuals and style Mortal Kombat manages to win some more points. Creators chose a fancy way to show off the powers of each character and they manage to surprise you with the realistic special effects. There was some big effort not only for battles and powers, but also for the brutal images with very cartoonish but awesome kills. The violence and the effects in general were spot on and they deserve recognition on that.The cast really tried to bring the feeling of this game to the movie, Josh Lawson was incredibly good as Kano and stole the show from the most famous characters, he aced the scum personallity and made me think that he should play more roles like this one. Joe Taslim was also quite badass as Sub-Zero, the character was kinda the boogeyman in this one but he did a nice job on making him look like a threat. All the other actors were fine, a few performances were quite wooden but that isn't enough to have a bad influence on the film.The important element that will probably satisfy many hardcore fans and even some less passionate ones will be the fan service. Big entrances, anthemic music, fatallities, cheesy one-liners and badass feeling, this is a movie to hype you and make you wanna re-visit the game or just smile and cheer, you might not get anything storywise but I think most people won't search for that. This is a badass no-brainer to reward the fans and that's why it's also a succesful film for its purpose.Conclusion:I will understand both the ones who liked this and the ones who didn't, it eventually comes to what you want this movie to be. I expected a fun no-brainer with glorious action and I got a great percentage of that, if the editing was better I would probably even like this a lot, but for now I will settle with what I got and I have to say I think it was pretty okay for me, not something I will revisit or remember quite often, but something that was a nice 2-hour relaxing choice. If you want something more than that you should probably think twice before watching this.Rating: 6.5/10.",Mortal Kombat
224,PeacepiperF20,Man these people complaining are ridiculous,10,23 April 2021,People literally have a problem with complaining and expecting too much. I really believe these people made up their minds before even watching this movie because it was fantastic. 100 percent better than all the movies recently released and definitely better than all the movies of 2020. Also for the directors first movie he did a hell of a job. The biggest annoyance is making the white male the idiot and making female characters overpowered.,Mortal Kombat
225,lord_cw,Strong effects with non obvious settings,5,13 September 2021,"I do not know if I like it or not, but it is not your traditional Mortal Kombat movie, with nice fast and great introduction of the players making people that does not have come in contact with Mortal Kombat before get familiar with it. What is really great.Love how elements of Mortal kombat comes in it without overdoing it for fans but making new audience getting crazy over repeatings. What I do pity is the cartoons they put in ancient places ugh, it is like when childern goes treasurehunting and look at old cartoon books to play it. The special effects are done really great. I could not imagine if the producer kills of great players that sson what they will put into the next movies. So many great ones, pity because those are the highlights. Like how raiden is more god than in the games what should because of his states but it could mean a clash in the movie and the games.Love the movie hold you really into your seat but also they planned an after movie making it also a bit stretchy and not able to make it every second solid strong. What I do like is the great flow of the movie.7/10 I would say, improvement on some acting what they do really great compare to some great hollywood movies, but still some traditional hollywood moments. The quality of psychical elements are not high making it bit sloppy and dragging the overall movie quality.",Mortal Kombat
226,theemuhammede,"short movie, lack of character build",6,24 April 2021,"Among all the movies that release each year, there are always 3-5 movies that I most look forward to. For 2021, Mortal Kombat is one of those movies. I mostly anticipated how Warner Bros. Was going to bring this universe of characters back to life.This movie was short considering that it is under two hours in length. I believe that it was done to play it safe and jump right to what probably most audiences want to see, the fights. Do not get me wrong, I absolutely appreciate an action-packed sci-fi movie. But I also do desire strong character build. The issue with this movie's length is that it can only allow so much development and growth in the characters. Both sides had at least 6-7 characters to be familiar with, and that is too many characters to connect with in under two hours. Among all the villains in the movie, only two had any type of character development. Sub-Zero had the most development, and he was followed by Kano. From all the champions or defenders of Earth, Cole Young was the only character with focused development.Scorpion too had some character build, but I felt he really deserved a much bigger presence. The movie gave the impression that his character was going to have a similar story presence to the 2020 animated movie Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge.It is time to move on to the fighting. Each fight was shorter than what I would like to watch, but each fight was mind-blowing in its own way. One thing that Warner Bros. Really nailed right was the character cast and their acting/fighting abilities on the big screen which mirrored the characters in the video games. The one character that most impressed me was Max Huang's Kung Lao. Kung Lao's introduction brought me to the edge of my seat because it was so unexpected. The one fight that I most enjoyed was Scorpion vs. Sub-Zero; I like both characters, but I have always been a fan of Scorpion and his Shirai Ryu ninja clan. The movie was inevitably leading to these two fighting to the death, both fights between the two met all my expectations.If Warner Bros. Continues this story in the future, I hope that it provides more appropriate connection between the characters and the audience. Each current cast member depicted his or her perspective charter exceptionally well, and I would hope to see each return. Moreover, if they do continue this series and introduce Johnny Cage, can you please cast Chris Evans to play him?",Mortal Kombat
227,nodlimax,The movie works for me,7,2 October 2021,Looking at this Mortal Kombat movie objectively I'd have to give it a 5 or 6/10. The visuals are good and the same goes for the fights as well as the gore.I also chuckled a few times regarding character interactions. Still the characters are rather flat. Also the whole aspect of the special abilities is just glanced over and to easily accepted.In addition there was to much focus on Kano. He's kinda entertaining at the start but becomes rather annoying later in the movie. The other characters aren't really getting their chance to really shine. The MC especially is pretty underwhelming overall.Still I enjoyed the movie for what it is and I was looking and speculating regarding the characters at times. They usually managed to reflect the look of the game characters in the movie.Mortal Kombat is definitively not a masterpiece but it has quite a few enjoyable moments during the combat an when you have certain obvious situations taken from the game (fatalities for example).,Mortal Kombat
228,arod_85,Ehhh. Could have been better,6,24 April 2021,"MK has such a cult following, interesting characters with intriguing backstories. Mix in supernatural abilities and martial arts with cool scenery and it should have not been that difficult to come up with an interesting movie that could be taken seriously. Why is it so hard to bring these characters to the big screen without it coming off as a low budget cheese fest? This probably would have worked better as a limited series on HBO Max or Netflix using the same tone as GOT or the Witcher instead of an hour and a half movie. It needed time to show characters backstories instead of trying to push a new character on the audience who was written to be very uninteresting. The movie's first scene started off interesting with Scorpion's origin story and his decades long contention with Subzero, but once the present day scenes started, it depreciated in quality very quickly. It wasn't the worst movie I've seen, but it had so much wasted opportunity. Kung Lao, Sub Zero and Scorpion were the only characters that had impressive fighting skills and they were all significantly underutilized. Some iconic characters came off like amateurs, like Liu Kang and Sonya. Other iconic characters were not even introduced or mentioned (why have Nitara and Kabal, yet no Kitana and Johnny Cage? I actually think the 1995 movie had a better storyline (but had horrible fight sequences). With the exception of subzero, the villains were a joke. MK has enough interesting stories to tell without introducing a new character. It was a risk that did not pay off. Heck, the story mode in the video game has a better plot, they should have just ripped one of those off!",Mortal Kombat
229,ThomDerd,Not bad. 1st part of a trilogy.,6,14 May 2021,"Great visuals, excellent fight scenes, good choices on most of the cast (e.g Kano, Scorpion, Sub-Zero) and just a fun movie overall. If you are familiar with the game, you will like it.Keep in mind that it's a trilogy, so this first film tries to add some background! Luckily there's not much time spent on meaningless conversations and the scenes get into the action parts faster than you would expect. Runtime of 1h 50min is works well; you will not be bored.Fight scenes get more rewarding halfway through, closer to the game style.Also, the idea to rotate this film's story around the rivalry between scorpion and sub-zero worked; it gave some background. Maybe the lead protagonist is not that interesting compared to the other characters but he seems necessary to keep the story moving forward.So, this first film does the job and although not everyone from the game is in it, I m sure all the other favorite characters will appear in the next 2 films and I m looking forward to that.6,5/10 good effort bringing the game on film screen.",Mortal Kombat
230,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,"Fun, violent and action-packed; unapologetically made for fans of the Mortal Kombat games",7,10 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat is a fun bloody action-packed romp that puts pleasing fans of the video game first and introduces its mythology to general audiences second. Director Simon McQuoid directs with a love for the source material, delivering on the franchise's signature gory martial arts violence.The new story centers on Cole Young, a new character created for this film, and the ancient rivalry between Scorpion and Sub-Zero amidst the tournament determining the fate between the Earthrealm and Outworld.Screenwriters Greg Russo and Dave Callaham try to accomplish a lot. The script is of two minds, devoting half its attention to these two main plot lines while the other half is spent on world-building. Gradually as we move towards the middle of the film, it is full of world-building. This results in a somewhat rushed finale, but it's all forgivable knowing that the franchise is in the right hands and being done properly.The Scorpion and Sub-Zero rivalry is the best part. As Scorpion, Hiroyuki Sanada shines in a way he's never had in his past Hollywood films. In a much-deserved lead part, Sanada gets to showcase his steely-eyed charisma and impressive martial arts skills (the man is in his fifties). This film could have been centered on just Scorpion. I wish there was more of Sanada.Joe Taslim's Sub-Zero is freaking scary as a villain, to the levels of Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th. His ice powers are indomitable and throughout the fights, I was biting my nails watching how close his freezing hands were to his victims.The fight choreography is blood-gushingly violent. The action is shot in a way the audience can follow easily and the characters' powers are used creatively. Fans of the game will be satisfied to see all the signature moves and fatalities. Do not take your kids to this.Even though they are decent gags provided in the script, the comic relief works half the time. A lot of the actors are not selling the genuine human reaction enough to the craziness and it is swallowed up by the overall self-serious tone of the piece. Chin Han's Shang Tsung is a particular case where I felt the costume was wearing the actor.It's a testament to what Christopher Lambert and Linden Ashby brought to the original Mortal Kombat. They provided comic moments that helped ground the ridiculousness of what was happening. This remake gravely needed that charisma.The gags that did work, however, were great. There's a gag about leg sweeping and how it is a cheap move in the video game that had me laughing out loud.Josh Lawson's Kano, the film's other standout character, inherits the sole duty as the comic relief and audience avatar and elevates the talky scenes with irreverent quips and freeform profanity. Hearing Lawson unleashing F-bombs in one scene suddenly transported me back to watching movies in the nineties, back when I could enjoy a crude joke with expletives or a violent R-rated moment and did not have to feel guilty.And that in a nutshell, is what I enjoyed most about Mortal Kombat. It is unbridled unapologetic fun. The original film holds a special place in my teenage heart; I can't quite say if I like this film more than the original quite yet. Time will tell. For now, I hope the new Mortal Kombat is well-received and a future sequel to be in the works.",Mortal Kombat
231,WooderIce64,Feels Like Mortal Kombat,7,19 May 2021,"One of the most popular video game franchises of the 90s that continues to this day, Mortal Kombat was the source for two movies back then. Don't watch them, go straight to this version. While it may not be the best movie out there, it's a movie that fans of the games can clearly at least get some enjoyment out of. The reason this movie succeeds is because unlike other video game adaptations, this feels like a Mortal Kombat movie. It's got great action scenes, it's packed with references to the games, and, oh yeah, it's super violent. Any proper adaptation of Mortal Kombat needs that R rating. I'd sooner watch PG-13 rated Deadpool than PG-13 rated Mortal Kombat. And this movie lives up to that R with all the gory fatalities that made the games notorious back in the day.The main character is an original character named Cole. While there's already a host of characters to use, it is good that it doesn't focus too much on one of them in particular. Cole is a fairly generic protagonist, but he's more of a vehicle for the story to progress, much like a silent protagonist in other games. It makes good use out of the characters from the game. The ones most prominently featured are Sonya, Kano, Lui Kang, Kung Lao, Raiden, and Sub-Zero as the villain. Of course, Scorpion is in it, but he doesn't get much screen time. His little screen time is awesome, and he says, ""get over here!"" which alone makes it worth it. The characters all retain their moves and personalities from the games, which is welcome. Even some of the fatalities are carried out in live action. Some others could have been used better, namely Goro and Mileena, especially Goro. Perhaps most importantly, they all look exactly like they do in the games, so they are instantly identifiable. They are both perfectly cast and wearing perfect costumes.That being said, this is far from a perfect movie. It has massive pacing issues, and it feels like this is a seriously edited version of a much longer movie. The protagonists go from getting annihilated in one fight to handily winning in a span of 10 minutes. Also, the Mortal Kombat tournament, which the entire movie builds up to, doesn't happen at all. Granted, there is a sequel hook with Johnny Cage, so it's probably going to happen in the sequel, but still. Also, if you aren't familiar with the characters already, you're going to be lost, as this movie was clearly made for fans who already know the lore. And finally, Techno Syndrome is barely in it, most noticeable in the credits. If you can see past these things, Mortal Kombat is a solid action film that effectively captures the spirit of the games in all their violent action. You know what the sad thing is? This is probably the best video game movie adaptation ever made.",Mortal Kombat

234,jebyvyson,As I expected,5,24 April 2021,"Not many Mortal Kombat fans really cares about the story of the MK series, just blood and gore and it really delivers in this movie. The action was badass at best, something we wanted to see from the 1995 film but with GORE! As good as the action is, the movie itself felt rushed and changed up alot from the game series which made some things boring. The production design always seem to be a hit or a miss. Some area looks cool like you would see from the games, while others just doesn't seem impressive to look at on screen. The main character isn't that likable to me and I don't even know him from the games or what he's supposed to be. The other characters seems to be underwhelming, weird, or out of character. The only characters I liked in the movie was Kano, Jax, Scorpion, and most definitly Sub-Zero showing how threating he looks and act in this movie. Overall, I expected to be bad movie with good action series and that's what I got. I know it wouldn't win the critics, but there are some enjoyment to get out of this movie...but I still prefer the 1995 film over this since that film actually looks like the adaptation from the game.",Mortal Kombat

But the movie itself really makes up for those flaws. The backstory from the main character is engaging. The visuals and costumes have massive improvements from the 90s films. The acting is very solid. And especially intense action that makes the movie bloody and extreme like in the games. If you're a Mortal Kombat fan and you want to see an actual film based on it, this movie will have what you want. For quite some time, movies based on video games are improving from the previous ones and take them seriously as what those films really stay true to the games. And this film is one of them.

Nothing catchy here on that front here. A big trick missed!2) As anyone with some awareness will point out, the main character (Cole) has an unnerving amateurish vibe about him. That the plot made him look more of an annoying wuss didn't help either.3) Great support cast. Special mention to the Aussie who had some absolutely hilarious roast.4) The run time is about 30 min too long, especially apparent since the ending is incomplete and there's no tournament to speak of (that is hyped up in the first half incessantly).",Mortal Kombat

240,alanhowden-86367,A bad movie by any measure,3,4 October 2021,"Even by the standards of films based on video games this is not good. I've played the games since MK2 so I know the franchise has a stupid story but since the film seems happy taking some big liberties with it it should have been made better, not worse (who TF is the main character anyway and why is his super power having an armoured shirt- there are 80 character on the MK roster there was no need to create Cole blandy Mcbland face).The historical intro of the film is actually not bad but after that the film's watchability dives off a cliff. I've already mentioned that the story is dumb so it's a cardinal sin that large parts of the movie are also boring. The acting (Apart from Scorpion/Sub Zero/Shang Tsung) is awful, nothing really connects, there is no reason to care about Cole or his boring family, everything is all of a sudden far too easy in the end and all that went before is pretty pointless. Even the fight scenes are not particularly good. I really did not like this.",Mortal Kombat
241,Wikkid_Gamez,Excellent start to what will hopefully end up a trilogy....,10,24 April 2021,"I see a lot of people talking about the lack of certain things like the actual tournament, to much groundwork on background for certain characters and other characters completely missing from the movie, characters not looking the same etc, as well as people saying they wish there had been more action than only about 40-50% of the movie.I just want to point out to everyone that is not aware, that this is supposed to be the beginning of a trilogy (Yes, I am one of those people that follows stuff like that). Had they packed all of that into one movie it would have been overload.I personally think it was an excellent start! Excellent character casting and personality building on everyone. I love all the visual, Outworld and the temple on Earth. As well as all the visual hints in the movie of future character's for those of us that are a little obsessive.I like the music upgrades, they still have the feel of the original and bring back memories with a slightly more contemporary vibe to keep it from sounding dated. Crossing my fingers that this first installment does well enough so that the next installment goes ahead. The only reason that I am worried that it may not is because of everything thats happened over the past year, not because of the movie not being good enough.I personally loved this movie, as the first of a trilogy. If it were a stand alone I may be a little disappointed that certain personal favorites *cough* Katana *cough* Nightwolf *cough* were not in it, however, I saw Katana's blade fan in the temple although it didn't get a neon sign the way Shinnok's amulet did when Kano tried to steal it, and one of the newspaper clippings on Sonya Blade's research wall pointed to a possibility for a future Nightwolf to me. But between those hints and the big hint (blazing neon sign really lol) at the end when Cole Young heads to Hollywood and as he leaves a movie poster for Johnny Cage as Citizen Cage is left in focus of the camera spell out for some excellent future possibilities/probabilities. They would have had to include other realms in this movie to pull in characters like Katana and again, that probably would have been information overload for one movie. They are taking their time and doing this right and I for one appreciate it greatly!Looking forward to the next installment of this trilogy!",Mortal Kombat
242,A_Llama_Drama,An amusing re-introduction to Outworld and the Netherrealm,6,25 April 2021,"Want to see a man with metal arms squash someone's head like a grape? Or see a dragon made of fire simultaneously swallow and char a man to a crisp? How about an ancient magician gleefully suck the soul out of a hot martial artist? All for absolutely no reason? You've come to the right place.Mortal Kombat is a stupid, senseless film. But it's fun, gory and got the sort of fan service you'd expect from a movie built around fan expectationsUnfortunately, it's like one big tease to what will finally be waiting for the Earthrealm fighters when they get to go save Earth. A lot of the film is spent watching bit part characters find their special powers. I accidentally looked at the runtime while watching and was surprised to find out more than half the film had passed and we still hadn't gotten to Mortal Kombat.Still, almost every character gets to showcase one of their most iconic fatalities (RIP, Reptile) and there's fun to be had in seeing Sonya beat up Kano again (even if the actors are different, the chemistry between these two characters is eternal). Sadly, the movie seems content with just scratching the surface of what can be done. Fights are all one-on-one, and while the characters and their move-sets are full of potential, fight choreography, editing and story is lacking almost entirely. Hopefully, in the next one (I really hope there's another), they can build upon what these characters and actors are capable of and give us more thrilling action with loftier goals.Support fan cinema!

243,greggman,Not as good as the original,6,25 April 2021,"That probably sounds ludacris as the original is arguably not a good movie but as bad or silly as the 1995 movie was this one just doesn't come together as well.The CGI is obviously much better in this one given it's been 21 years. The fight choreography is mostly better too. But, the original had a far more exotic setting whereas this one the settings seem just generic caves.The biggest issue though is the writing, not that the original had good writing, it just worked better than this one.For one the main character sucks. He loses 3 of 4 fights. He would have lost the final fight except for getting help.Then there are all kinds of other issues. Magic powers make some sense but why does Jax get robot arms? That doesn't seem to fit the magic theme. I guess they are ""magic robot arms"".What is Cole's power? It's never explained or clear. Is his magic gold armor invincible? When he's getting pummeled by Goro each hit seems to be adding energy to his armor but he never spends that energy. Then when he fights Sub-Zero his armor never lights up as Sub-Zero punches him.Liu Kang calls forth a giant fire dragon. Why didn't he just do that as his first move?Shang Tsung takes Kung Lao's soul, why doesn't he just do that with every one? In the first movie he only does that after a warrior is defeated.The first time we meet Kung Lao he materizes out of the floor. Is that another power? Why does he never use it again?While Cole is fighting Sub-Zero a miracle happens and Scorpion appears, why?Sub-Zero is defeated by the combo of Cole and Scorpion. 2 against one seems unfair and unsatisfying.With Sub-Zero down, Scorpion, who's learned to control the fires of hell, shoots fire out of his mouth and burns Sub-Zero to death. Why didn't he just do that at the start?Frozen people shatter yet Cole is punching the ice encasing his mom and sister. Cole also stupidly turns his back on Sub-Zero to punch ice.The best parts of the movie are all Sonya Blade. Her moves are all amazing and she's confident and kicks ass. But, this brings up another place the first movie is better. There's more eye candy as we have both Sonya Blade and Kitana.Kano is also not bad as a baddie. He's easy to hate which you're supposed to do.I still enjoyed watching this bad movie as a dumb action movie based off of a video game but, while I've put on the 1995 movie once every 5-6 years as I find it semi-entertaining, I don't think this movie crosses that threshold of enjoyment that I'd ever watch it again.",Mortal Kombat
244,MovieWarfare,"Boring characters, messy plot but the beginning and end are amazing",5,25 April 2021,"I am a huge fan of the Mortal Kombat games. They have very creative gore and fatalities but another thing that makes it special is the lore, story and characters. Video game movies are starting to get better so I had some hope for Mortal Kombat (2021) especially since it was going to be R Rated. The premise is ""Hunted by the fearsome warrior Sub-Zero, MMA fighter Cole Young finds sanctuary at the temple of Lord Raiden. Training with experienced fighters Liu Kang, Kung Lao and the rogue mercenary Kano, Cole prepares to stand with Earth's greatest champions to take on the enemies from Outworld in a high-stakes battle for the universe"". So is this a flawless victory or fatally flawed?Firstly, I love the casting choice. Joe Taslim as Sub Zero and Hiroyuki Sanada as Scorpion is phenomenal casting as both embody their characters. John Lawson steals every scene he is in as Kano. He is hilarious and genuinely some of the best parts of Mortal Kombat (2021). Ludi Lin as Liu Kang, Max Huang as Kung Lao, Mehcad Brooks as Jax, Jessica McNamee as Sonya is all also great casting as they resemble the characters from the game perfectly. Tadanobu Asano is very majestic as Lord Raiden and Chin Han is very sinister as Shang Tsung. I also really appreciate having an Asian be the main character with Lewis Tan as Cole Young. It's great that the director, Simon McQuoid, is giving Asians more representation in mainstream media and I can appreciate that.A lot of video game movies don't work because it is clear the director and writers are not fans of the respective game. However, this is not the case here and this clearly shows within the movie. They have authentic casting so characters that were Asian in the game are played by Asians in the movie, characters act and resemble their game counterparts, gruesome fatalities and a lot of game references. Additionally, the first 10 minutes is amazing and is such a great start to the movie. The last 15 minutes of the movie is also really good which is down to the fact that any scene with Sub-Zero and Scorpion is great. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch is also quite good at times when orchestral instruments are used.However, sometimes the score can be quite odd such as when electronic sounds are used in the 17th-century scene which doesn't sound right. Furthermore, the editing of certain scenes is quite bad. Despite casting an actual martial artist who can fight, the director still uses a lot of quick cuts in fight scenes that just ruin it. It even happens during sparring fights which just makes it very disorienting. The most jarring editing comes around the middle where multiple fights are occurring with different characters and the scene just keeps constantly swapping between all of them. Instead of just focusing on one fight at a time which would result in a more pleasant experience. On that note, the action scenes not concerning Sub Zero or Scorpion lack a lot of brutality, grit and damage. You don't feel like the characters are getting hurt enough as during fights it feels like they are just slapping each other about. Where are the broken bones, bruises or physical impact in these fights?Another major flaw is the main lead Cole Young as he is very bland and uninteresting. The only thing about his character is he a chosen one and he has a family that he cares about. It's boring. The supporting characters are not that great either since there are way too many characters and not enough time exploring them. Liu Kang and Kung Lao appear but are pretty much just the strong yet generic Asian guys. Jax and Sonya are just initially there to get the plot moving and then fight some people which is all there is to them. Mileena, Goro and Kabal are in the movie but are just there to be fodder for the heroes. We get absolutely no information about them, not even an explanation on why Kabal has super speed. Raiden is a good powerful guy and Shang Tsung is a bad powerful guy. Both barely appear and when they do it is when the plot needs teleporting stuff.MINOR SPOILERS HERE
Following that, the story is a mess. It starts in the 17th century with Scorpion and Sub Zero. Scorpion's family gets murdered and he dies as well but goes to hell. However, his thirst for vengeance for his family being murdered by Sub Zero will bring him out of hell and that alone is an interesting story. Such a shame we ignore that and just focus on boring Cole Young. The marketing plays up Scorpion's role but he is only at the beginning and the end. He also just randomly appears at the end with little to no explanation. It's very baffling even to me, a Mortal Kombat fan. Throughout Mortal Kombat (2021) there is a lot of build-up for this tournament. It feels like the movie will conclude with the tournament but it does not which is kind of annoying. They spend two-thirds of the movie leading to it but then decide in the 3rd act just to forget about it. This is where Mortal Kombat (1995) does better as the 1st act is the setup and the 2nd and 3rd are the tournament which is way better.Overall, Mortal Kombat (2021) does a lot of right in satisfying fans but doesn't do enough to bring new people in. It feels like they were just ticking boxes instead of making a cohesive and good movie in general. Mortal Kombat has great characters which are why the movie should've just focused on one of them instead of just bringing in as many characters as they could. The movie has a fair amount of things better than the 1995 version but a fair amount that isn't as well. The only conclusion that I got out of it was that at least it was way better than Mortal Kombat Annihilation and honestly that is a huge win in my book.",Mortal Kombat

I felt fine because it is based on video game and a lot of lines such as come over here, flawless victory, your soul is mine we're ok too.The things I dislike about the movie is it is considered as a big budget movie a lot of budget were put in why can the writer write a decent story line and use a more decent CGI which in a way spoilt the whole movie showing nothing but gore, only the character sub Zero CGI were good the rest is just sad.This movie is produce by James Wan which is one of my favourite director yet it felt like I'm watching some B Grade movie quality.",Mortal Kombat

I don't understand why the creators of this movie seem to have not studied one single Chinese Kung Fu film... which is what the original game from 1992 was based on, and why that game is so legendary. Then make a sequel and throw in some horror elements. Bam, you got two amazing Mortal Kombat movies... but no, you try to throw in 30 years of convoluted video game reboot crap story and throw it into one movie and introduce a protagonist that's not in the game... The intro to this movie was actually really great... it felt like a proper Kung Fu movie... too bad they decided to just derail that whole tone and feel and go straight to clown town.I watched this movie at midnight on HBO Max, knowing that this was going to play out exactly like this. You know why? Because MK is part of my childhood. I'm a fan, always for life because that game introduced me to Kung Fu movies. I remember my father telling me, ""You think that game is cool son? Here, check out this old movie from the 70s called Enter the Dragon starring one of the greatest martial artist that ever lived... seems like the plot to your game is nearly identical..."" But here's the thing. The producers of this heap on HBO know that a 38 year old like me is going to watch it no matter what, and no matter how terrible of movie it is, will at least be MILDLY entertained by it. And that's enough for them. They make money. I'm mildly entertained and want to play Mortal Kombat now. Good job?I think they just did a babality on me... It's good business.

As much as disappointing their country's heavy censorship is, Indonesian viewers can still take pride of their fellow countryman actor becomes the MVP of the movie.

Don't come in expecting 100% accuracy to the games when it comes to some lore and looks of certain characters, as this movie is ""its own thing"".Story wise I think still hard to nail down a good story for a movie version. There are alot of loopholes and things that happen that won't make sense. Again, gives its a game adaptation, don't expect a well thought out, deep story.Gore wise... there are some great things you see that you don't see in the trailers. I wish there could have been more, but what I seen did give me hope that maybe the next one will offer more.Music wise it kind of sucked. Only at the end did you sort of even get a MK theme hint. And in general the movie wasn't as good as the old movies. I may be bias given the techno/electronic sound of the music in those movies. Heck this movie doesn't even have a catchy MK song at all.Some of my nitpicks were:
1. Some of the lines were to cheesy. ""Get over here"" makes sense in a battle and is the one line that didn't feel weird. But some people would say things like ""Fatality"" or other quotes from the game at the end of a match, it felt cheesy.2. The characters are hit or miss. I won't spoil who else is in it but the ones you seen in the trailer like Jax for example, you don't really care or get into them. The only one I ended up liking was Kano oddly enough. The actor really took on the role. The other actors tried, but it didn't feel right. Not that it was the worst ever, just don't expect Oscar worthy performances or emotional feelings.3. While there are alot of great fights in this, a good amount of them you already seen in the trailer. Though as I said at the start, some of the scenes not in the trailer were fan service! One of which I will just say ""Hats off to them"" for it, they killed it!4. Obviously given the fact it's MK, there is alot of CGI. Some of it is pretty good. But a good portion of it is nothing amazing. Even some of the fatalities
were a bit cartoony CGI wise. Not terrible, just not as great as they could have been.Movie is worth a watch for sure. I wouldn't but it though. Nor would I see it again really.

Mortal Kombat Annihilation from 1997 was as cheesy as they come and I can swallow and appreciate the tropes that that movie made compared to the tropes of this one. The post covid sets with the inclusive cast mixed with the marvel universe non-serious humor really left a bad taste in my mouth.The biggest problem with this movie is the fact that they had to find their ""Arcana"" which is some fantasy power move like a Marvel superhero similar to Animality from the 97' MK movie. This movie was a mess with the very small portion of cool video game reference scenery that would make people cheer.Funniest plot idea to me was that they DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE TOURNAMENT. Yes, you heard me. They never got to the tournament, its only fighting the ""bad guy"" before the tournament (Which is against the rules) and Rayden choosing to let it happen because of the Elder gods rules. Which ultimately leads to Kung Lao's death (again). Then when Rayden is asked why did he let it happen, he said because he cannot help all souls of Earthrealm. Yet, he is willing to let, ya know, one of his prized fighters on earthrealm die to someone who is killing him outside the rules of the tournament.... Nice.Overall just bad movie. I don't care about the video game accuracy or the cheesy one liners or the bad CGI at certain parts.

I think it could have been MUCH better, if they spent less time on the introduction and more time on actually fight!!Finally, the ending was SO LAME!! Without trying to provide any spoilers, I'll just say - in the last 30 seconds of the movie, a new 'hero name' is revealed.... so STUPID!!NOT RECOMMENDED: Unless you just want background noise, or it's your goal to waste 2 hours of your life, then go ahead and watch.

I enjoyed it although the story felt like something was missing. Felt like it was edited badly just to fit it in below 2 hour mark. Knowing WB executives it's possible they chopped up this movie. It definitely could've been better if the story or plot actually meant something. Acting was okay by some. This ""cole young"" character is waste of time and I didn't care for his character.

271,jcallows,Missed Opportunity,7,25 April 2021,"I enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat but thought it was a little too campy and wanted something grittier and more down to earth. The trailers for the new version gave me the impression I was going to get it.I did, somewhat. This film tried to be more grounded but unfortunately the poor dialogue and screenplay made it hard for me to take it seriously.The strengths of this film were of course the special effects and action scenes. The inclusion of a few gory fatalies from the video game was especially entertaining. The decision to focus on Sub-Zero and Scorpion was a good one, as they are the two of my favorite characters. Kano surprisingly stole the show. He had all the best lines. The cast overall was fine, though some could've used a few more acting lessons. The actors did look nice though.But that's about it as far as the positives. Maybe it's the weak script or poor acting but the film felt like a straight-to-video B-movie. I liked that the characters had regular names and I wished they had gone by those, instead of bluntly announcing their video game names later in the movie. It would've sounded less silly if their video game names had been used indirectly and more subtly. The soundtrack was non-existent. The best part of it was when it recycled a bit of the music from the the original at the end.The original Mortal Kombat was good but it left much to be desired. This new version intended to surpass the original in quality but unfortunately ended up not even meeting it.",Mortal Kombat

I had so many expectations after seeing the awesome trailer, but was let down somewhat. First off, if you want to see blood, guts, and gore....this is the movie for you. The fight scenes were outstanding and stayed true to the history of MK. All the blood, gore, and guts made this movie. Now for the bad....the acting! It was atrocious. And I mean bad especially from the one main character.....an actor I have never seen before! The storyline was simple, but they did not develop any of the characters. I know character development is not what MK is about, but they just threw a bunch of our fav characters in the movie and expected us to care about them. Overall it was a fun movie to watch and the fight scenes are worth watching. They did set it up for a second movie.",Mortal Kombat

As bad as the original movie was I enjoyed it because at the time it brought the video game to the big screen for many fans. Back then, even the acting was pretty good. Sadly, this MK has awful acting.The screenplay wasn't that great, they took the Mortal Kombat theme but stretched it and added some nonsense about arcana. The characters were all stale. I'm assuming no big names to save on budget. Lewis Tan is a terrible lead and he can't fight at all. Chin Han plays an AWFUL Shang Tsung. Josh Lawson is an irritating Kano. The only redeeming actor was Hiroyuki Sanada and sadly he was in it the least.The fight scenes were pretty good, but not enough to carry the film.

279,med77_99,Disappointing,4,14 April 2021,"I was looking forward to watching the new Mortal Kombat with much hope.Unfortunately, this 2021 adaptation is disappointing and inferior even to the 1995 version.The story lacks depth and so there was no tension in the film to keep us interested throughout.The casting is the worst, actors are just terrible here, and I understand they had to find athletic people for the roles, but at least cast big names for the roles of Raiden and Tshang sun.Lu Kang and Kung lao are two very boring and uninteresting characters.The dialogue is also bad, apart from some funny parts, most of it seemed forced.Then comes the fighting, definitely not very well choreographed nor properly edited despite it being superior visually to the 1995 version.In these type of films we need to see martial arts moves to enhance the experience not just total destruction and special powers. I recall Johnny Cage vs Scorpion fight from 1995 to be the best fight so far.Perhaps the Scorpion vs Subzero fight here is the best, yet it still feels like it's missing something.Still the movie does offer some enjoyable parts and is stunning visually ( although i thought Reptile's scene and CGI was mediocre).The highlight as I mentioned is Scorpion vs Subzero fight.Please, have better writers in the future to write the script with smart dialogue, and cast better actors. Also, bring in martial arts experts for the fights choreography.",Mortal Kombat
280,influxtwo,Disappointment you can only see for yourself to believe,6,24 April 2021,"I watched the original 90's movie several times as a kid and was fixated on it forever, didn't mind Annihilation either. I watched the original again twice back to back recently to prepare for this new installment. Relishing in the original's simplicity, pacing, and- yes- depth, it truly was the product of a good classic action movie; and a somewhat authentic adaptation with heart.This new one...some might love, and that is fine. I however didn't hate it. But the Mortal Kombat kid in me was left feeling a bit empty and deprived. I went in to this totally open to accept the Cole character and was open to any other possibility thrown at me. However, I am left disappointed with that overall outcome.Cole Young for some reason is wedged in to the story with a bunch of ""family"" screen time that whittles down the screen time so much it outweighs the supposed Mortal Kombat story we showed up for. Characters that are actually in the game then are pushed to the side as a rather nondescript sidekick or side character.Then some of the characters you might have shown up for in the first place get maybe one or two lines if they're even lucky and then some are promptly murdered 8 to 12 seconds later. It happens so fast there is simply no momentum or emotion behind it.I found myself constantly saying ""Less talking... more fighting"" because some of the characters just blab on and on and I was one of the few in the audience who seemed to feel that Kano's jokes fell flat and for me were largely unfunny. The seriousness was robbed of it's depth by a onslaught of poor comedy attempts.It's difficult to see a movie that feels so premature that can only be improved on by a sequel. It makes the 90s film feel like a complete and fleshed out action classic in comparison. This became a diluted prequel tease with a lot of damage control for a sequel to live up to. I expect some characters even who perished will return and I can only hope their stories carry more weight next time.This film felt like the inhale without the exhale. Too brief, limited and fleeting. It's hard to take it seriously when characters are wasted 12 seconds in to their first or second mini-battle. Another thing I noticed is nearly every scene from the trailer was the only good scenes, and there was really not much you did not see from the trailer left to view. This was a case of an ultimate marketing job with little else to find. I feel like it was almost even a money grab.Sub Zero and Scorpion's story felt isolated and almost to be from a completely different movie and pasted in. That was the movie quality that should've been the rest of this too.Cole Young, I am sorry to say but he was a sore thumb in the middle of all this and really took away from the stories core rather than eclipse it. There was no need for Cole's family to be tagging along into outworld either this kind of shoe-horning took a great potential and made it in to a TV show spin-off quality for me, and simply did not work. It was cringe and if that's the only way they could get the audience to feel something for their characters then maybe they missed the point of Mortal Kombat altogether.I will be too curious not to see the sequels, but I'm no longer holding my breath on this one. This didn't touch the original film. Sorry not sorry. But with that disappointment aside, I could not hate this film either. You might love this, and that is great. I can't say I was that excited by the end product. The pacing of the original movie is undying, the pacing of this one. Well I just don't think I care to see Cole Young's family in peril time and time again. Not what I signed up for when I agreed to pay for a Mortal Kombat movie.I will stick with the original because even on a rewatch it still doesn't get boring unlike this one. Not much rewatchability here. The original has a pace that doesn't get tired. This one has Mileena, so hey, at least there's that.The ""powers"" were written so corny this time around, you'd never know this was a rated R movie and not a Disney one. Kano's eye and Jax's arms are supposed to be cybernetics. Not magic? Why do they need a birthmark to be worthy. If not for the forced profanity and tiny bit of gore (none of which was impressive) I would have never known this was a rated R movie.Not a patch over the original. A decent fantasy spin-off at best. View at your own risk. Fatality.",Mortal Kombat

282,ty-jensen,Decent video game movie.,6,24 April 2021,"I was only curious for Mortal Kombat because I'm a casual moviegoer like with Godzilla. I played the Sega Genesis version when I was a little kid and I seen the first movie on Netflix back in December 2015. I skipped the second movie but I seen the Nostlagia Critic's review and Chris Stuckmann's review. Mortal Kombat was the kind of movie I expected, a serviceable martial arts movie.The characters are weak as expected, most blockbusters have weak characters. Cole Young was really bland and he was created for the movie so the cast can be more diverse. Johnny Cage should of been the protagonist but he was saved for the sequel. Kano is the best character, he's a charming scumbag.Mortal Kombat is darkly cheesy, it has plenty of humor mainly from Kano. The humor landed for me, I laughed several times. Yeah, the dialogue sucks. The plot is weak and rushed but I can't think of any martial arts movie with a strong plot.The fight scenes are cool but they could of been better because there's some choppy editing. Mortal Kombat is a hard R so it's really bloody. The characters don't feel like they're in danger not even Cole. The visuals are fine, they look like TV show visuals.Overall, Mortal Kombat is another serviceable martial arts movie. Yes, it's better than the first movie. I think most video game fans and martial arts fans will enjoy it.",Mortal Kombat
283,jelencesb,To be comoletely honest...,8,24 April 2021,"One cannot take a stab at this MK movie...And I say that as someone who is not a fan of fighting movies and superhero character typ3 movies because all of them end up shallow and stupid, but I also say this as a fan of MK!So, the movie was very well done from the very beginning, first with visuals, second with the back storyline. Fighting scenes also amazing. I tried to find the flaw in the movie so I can take a stab at it, and write that it, like all of the previous bad MK movies, ruined my fav video game of all times. But this time I cannot say that, I cannot do that. I cannot say that the movie couldnt have been slightly better, it surely could have had been, but I can also find few flaws which didnt cause the chink in the movie in overall. I rarely nowadays enjoy a movie because movie makers actually do not put so much effort into making movies of any kind... But this time I say I thoroughly enjoyed it!Now, the two flaws I found were a bad acting at one point and some pointless dialogue... But it was like 10 seconds out of the entire movie. And the second was, which made me very sad, nonexistence of the Earth princess Kitana in this one. She ahould have appeared instead of that frivolous monster Mileena. I MEAN for the very FIRST time in the MK franchise we have a more than a decent movie and there is no Kitana? 😕Anyway, very enjoyable movie and so worth going to cinema to watch it!And all of you mist admit that Goro looked amazing and that in the end even Mileena didnt disappoint turning into the monster she is.I hope that all of the MK fans are happy with this movie.",Mortal Kombat

286,pedroquintaoo,Amazing for fans... Enjoyable for the rest,8,23 April 2021,"This film adaptation of Mortal Kombat has everything that made the videogames incredible. In this story you have charismatic protagonists (Kano and Sonya Blade are my favorite ones), a lot of fight scenes well choreographed and some violence (but this one isn't so gruesome as the last videogames installments are).As Mortal Kombat fan, I had a lot of fun during almost 2 hours, however there are 2 problems:
The villains don't have any development, they are on the story just to fight, we never got any knowledge about them and they never feel to be a really threat.Even being the film adaptation that the fans deserve, I think some spectators will feel a little lost in the story or won't understand some videogames references.Even having some problems, Mortal Kombat is one of the best film adaptations I've ever seen.When the movie ended, I wanted to watch more...

This movie had better locations, better combat scenarios and more lore to keep an interest. The action was graphic and plentiful which meets the MK dossier and a new character to bring the audience into the MK universe was a neat touch. Kano was also decent this time around and provided the comedy everyone was looking for. However, the writing is VERY basic, campy, cheesy and not enough acting talent could make it feel natural. Felt very forced throughout especially with introductions to some of the characters as the movie progressed. Also, not enough Hiroyuki Sanada.Recommended for a decent actioner but keep expectations low.",Mortal Kombat
288,botrytis,Ehm... 1995 Mortal Kombat wins?,6,24 April 2021,"I'm not getting it how hard it is to do finally a well shot, well written, well edited Mortal Kombat movie, both the 1995 movie and this had many great elements visual, set, scene-wise that could have been perfect if a little more creative work would have been put in but this nearly wasn't worth the wait at all. I think they wanted to do some Marvel Universe-like attempt with this franchise but that's just not the right direction to go with this, that's just way apparent right away.(1) The sets that had anything to do with Mortal Kombat looked great, especially the Outworld ones. The costumes were fine, Sub-Zero and Scorpion for the win, but characters like Liu Kang, Raiden were a bit fishy overall, could had been done better.(2) The story might have been good on paper, the plot associated with Scorpion/Sub-zero has a fine circle to it, but anything other than that is just a rushed narration that ends up being a hot messy filler being all over the place. Random things happen with random consequences (below the level of human logic or the understanding of a sober mind) on some occasions where you just cannot wrap your head around it, and have no time to even think about it because...(3) The pacing of this movie is SUPER FAST, on BRUTALITY level. Zero suspense at any dramatic scene because it doesn't give you time to even absorb the feelings a human can develop in a healthy way to try to even give 1% of a damn for any character on the screen. There is no time for that. Some character is just having a hard time, being sad? Who gives a damn, next scene, someone is explaining a lore to you to know some background story of a place, oh wait oh wait, next scene we are already fighting, oh wait, there are other not yet seen characters from the game in the movie, say hello to them as well, oh wait, let's fight again.... I mean, come on! We are just jumping from scene to scene, this is no way to tell a story of any sort.(4) The music... what music? Oh you mean this POS? It had almost ZERO, and I mean ZERO reason to be in this movie or any other one for that matter. It's like it was made for a random Marvel movie and ended up here somehow. It's pointless, trailer/commercial-like, cheap, nothing-to-do-with-anything garbage. It might have been better to just leave the movie music-free.(5) The acting was fine, I mean, if I know it well these people are mostly stunt actors and they had done everything from their power in an action/fighting movie, so no issue there. I definitely liked Kano the most, he brought good times on screen with his hilariousity.(6) The visuals were decent, some places they were really good and on other places a bit underdeveloped. Sub-Zero's freezing VFX were probably the most well done as it seems they have used many practical effects for it, I loved these.(7) The action/fight parts of the movie were well done, they have really put a huge deal of effort into that... if only I could give a damn about any of the characters that were fighting. Many times, during fights they were using fast cuts between close ups and really far, near panorama views that made the fightings chaotic and disorienting.But what were surprisingly great were the Astonishingly Brutal Fatalities. Oh my... they were really a sight to see on the screen and something that captured the essence of the source material JUST RIGHT!This just wasn't worth it in my sad but honest oppinion. If I'm thinking about this and the 1995 movie I'm shocked that I don't see much difference between these two. Both of them have many issues, elements that just backfires on many levels, but both of them are warmheartedly done good garbage flicks that in a way resonates with the source material they are adapting from. Both of them have such well executed elements cinematography/set/atmosphere/visual-wise that I easily could see those in a close perfect Mortal Kombat movie that could use them way better. But unfortunately this one too couldn't be that... well, maybe in another 15 years.",Mortal Kombat

291,cristinalinderman,An unwatchable adaptation.,1,25 April 2021,"* There is no end credit scene *Simon McQuoid, in his feature directorial debut and crew, brought an unwatchable adaptation. I don't know which part was worse the direction, the story, the music, or the performances. I wasn't surprised at how terrible the film was because, from the moment the trailer hit, I instantly knew how bad it might be. Such a shame because when they announced for the first time that a Mortal Kombat movie was in the works I was so thrilled especially since it was rated R. I was more excited by it because I thought the fatalities were going to be gruesome and entertaining to watch. I can't believe I'm going to say this but I prefer to watch the Mortal Kombat 1995 version over this reboot. There wasn't a scene that I enjoyed everything was going from bad to worse and all I kept thinking about was to end the film but I kept holding on and on watching how the seconds were so slow for it to finish. I only felt happiness the moment it hit the end credits, I almost yelled ""finally!"". This movie felt like I was watching a low-budget bad TV Show that took too long to end for it to finish. When the moment came on the film to explain Mortal Kombat it was like a blur with no suspense behind it. Everything was crashing down, scene after scene making too much humor with unimpressive fight sequences trying to hide the bad script and failing at it. I didn't mind that there was no actual tournament their idea to move past that was good but only the idea because the way everything unfolded was excruciating to watch.The composer Benjamin Wallfisch made the film even worse with his music. Not only I was annoyed by everything but the music was not helping. His music felt extremely out of place and it really didn't go well in any scene. It was making too much out of scenes that needed something smoother and when the scenes got heated the music push too much.The cast performances were painful to watch, not even the incredible Hiroyuki Sanada opening scene could save the film. He is an amazing actor but his part was bad as well and mainly towards the bad script, not his acting skills. The other cast members felt like all of them were rookies, so many of their lines made the scenes so cheesy and not to be taken seriously.",Mortal Kombat

I gave it a little more because I enjoyed some of it.The acting ruined it for me. Especially the actress, McNamee?, for Sonia Blyde. Bothers me more so that she thinks she's so awesome in real life too, as an actress. She was so awful in this, it ruined the movie for me. Every single scene she was in was awful. Find someone else to play her. There was nothing she did right. Awful dialogue, awful jokes, awful delivery, awful cinematography for fights, and awful story.The lead actor for Cole wasn't very good either, as his delivery in dialogue was very apparent in regards to acting or reading from a script. Character was kind of lame too.Why'd they race swap Mileena? She should have been Asian. Or at least an actress who knew how to fight. Mileena and Sonia's fight was so hard to watch. So stiff and slow. I can tell at least that Sonia's actress can fight a little, but Mileena's....no.Jax was cool, however, we hardly saw him and he should have lost his arms to Goro. Both characters were neglected and wasted. I thought Goro looked cool and was presented lame. Jax, in my opinion, was awesome and I liked the actor. But again, hardly there.Guy with the hammer, I forgot his name, was just stupid.Wasted Reptile. Completely.Finale complaint is I wish they made SubZero and Scorpion cooler.

This 10 min sequence is perhaps the best part of the film. Packed with great actors, well choreographed combat sequence and well directed scene is so emotionally impactful that we are left waiting for the payback at the end of film.Fast forward 3 centuries, Hanzo and Bi Han are now Scorpion and Sub Zero. The wait over the entire film for their second face to face sequence is worth it.Remaining characters are pretty much what you see in a cliche action film. Forgetful characters, plots that fail to create an impact and just average action scenes. Honestly you can just finish the film in half an hour if Scorpion Subzero scenes are watched together and you wouldn't miss any important plot points.Overall a good one time watch only thanks to Hiroyuki Sanada and Joe Taslim.

I found it most entertaining, unlike some people, I did not go into the movie expecting it to be anything less or more than it is, it's fun to watch, filled with action, a whole lot of fantasy, not so much adventure, but enough.The movie is worth watching, in fact I'll probably watch it again, and again, just for the entertainment value.

308,DanteRiggs,The trailer shows too much,8,24 April 2021,"I've been a MK fan for over 20 years. To put it short: I liked the movie. I feared it would be much worse and I hoped it would be much better. It's somewhere in the middle, between (very) entertaining and underwhelming.Cole - I'm not a big fan of the main protagonist. I wish we got Johnny Cage and more of Liu Kang (the real hero of the franchise) instead. Or make him be Kuai Liang.Liu Kang - He was fine, but I still prefer Robin Shou.Sub-Zero - He is my favorite MK character, so the only complain I have is that I wish his costume was a bit brighter. A brighter blue. He gets a lot of screen time, which I highly appreciateScorpion - He was good but his costume (like Sub-Zero's) could have been a little better. He looks too much like a regular samurai. Also, I had the impression that he would play a larger role in the movie.Raiden - A bit bland. Not bad, but a different actor would have been better. In this movie, he is more like Raiden from the games, but I prefer the sarcastic Raiden from the live adaptations (Jeffrey Meek or Christopher Lambert)Sonya, Jax, Kung Lao = very goodKano was good, but a little too likable. Kano shouldn't be a lovable goofball. And where is the metal plate?Shang Tsung - kinda flat. Nothing memorable.Mileena - Nah, wrong actress, wrong skin colour and wrong teeth. There's no reason to give her normal teeth even for 1 secondReptile - Ok but underused. And I prefer ninja Reptile, not Lizard-Man.Goro - good special effects, but not menacing enough. Too much like a jobber.other characters (so not to spoil anything) - I'm happy with what I got.Overall, it was entertaining but a little bit underwhelming. It's fun to watch but it doesn't really hype you up. The acting is sometimes cheesy, the action is good and the special effects are, for the most part, also good. The trailer shows way too much, there aren't many surprises left. And I wish they played the classic theme song during the final fight.I'm not sure how to rate this movie. At the moment, I feel it deserves a 8,4/10. And just to put things into perspective, I give Mortal Kombat (1995) a 9,7/10 and MK Legends: Scorpion's Revenge (2020) a 10/10.",Mortal Kombat
309,MackMonMay87,The 95 Original is Still the Reigning Champ,5,27 April 2021,"As a lifelong Mortal Kombat fan, of course I was excited about a new, official live action MK movie 24 years since the release of the hilariously awful ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"", and the smaller scale live action webseries that came out in the mid-00s. I didn't go into this with a chip on my shoulder and wanting to hate it, but it still falls massively short of the 1995 original Mortal Kombat movie, which still remains one of the best video game movies for one main reason: it doesn't and never did try to be anything but what it is.But enough comparisons the first to this one, even if it's hard not to do that. MK21 isn't a total turd, but it's far from a flawless victory. It's got debatably better visual effects, some real awesome-looking costumes (Sub Zero and Scorpion's costumes look outstanding in particular), and there are some good visuals such as Sub Z freezing the barrel of a shotgun in mid-fire, some gruesome fatalities, and some decent fight scenes, with anytime Hiroyuki Sanada and Joe Taslim (as Scorp and Sub Z respectively) fight being outstanding. This isn't a video game movie failure on the level of the latter Resident Evil movies, Alone in the Dark by Uwe Boll, or the live action Doom movies, but it's still hollow and bland aside from a few highlights.The first red flag I knew about in MK 21's development was the addition of Cole Young, a boring and bland original character and the addition of the concept of ""Akanas"" (I think this is how you say it) which are these birthmarks in the shape of the MK Dragon logo that pass from person to person, which is a ridiculous way to justify the characters having powers and leads to Cole literally developing powers out of nowhere. All of your favorite main characters who are fleshed out and interesting in the games are sidelined by Cole, showing that producers still don't understand how to properly adapt existing fictional worlds even after the massive success of the MCU.Mortal Kombat doesn't feature any cheezy messages about the power of friendship and care for family unlocking secret powers in the games, so why is it in the movie? They thought this would help it sell better to the mainstream public maybe? It falls flat because it ends up being boring on its own but doesn't do justice to the games either, so it ends up making you wonder who the changes are really supposed to be for. This is what ends up happening when you outsource the development of your movie to focus-groups instead of having confidence in the source material and doing your best to stay true to those concepts instead.Say what you will about the 95 version, but it understood that Liu Kang was the lead, made Shang Tsung into a charismatic, scenery-chewing and fun villain (played by the legendary Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa), and characters like Raiden served more of an actual purpose and introduced the characters (and by proxy the audience) to the supernatural elements of the story, as opposed to Sonya Blade doing some research with sticky notes and red-string that lead her to understanding that there's literally other universes and realms and a fighting tournament determines which realm can dominate the others. She doesn't seem too shocked about discovering this reality-altering information in MK21. She presents it as if she's reading it off the back of a video game box.The cast is mostly wasted, as they look like the characters and have their moments, and there's some fun callbacks to the games and even a few brief comedic scenes, so it's not a total waste, but overall, it feels as if this movie is relying on fans recognizing this thing or that thing from the games and expecting to coast by on that instead of telling a more compelling story. As a Mortal Kombat fan, I can tell you this version doesn't offer quite enough to ignore the lacking elements. You can't just build an entire movie off of gore&blood, references, nostalgia, and gags meant to remind you of something greater. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who isn't interested in the games or previous movies, but it's worth checking out if you've played the games and are curious, otherwise you should stick with the original 95 movie if you've never played or experienced anything MK-related, as it summarizes the essence of the franchise much more effectively (which is ironic because it has no gore, something MK is known for).",Mortal Kombat
310,tylerrosin,Mortal Kombat 2021,7,15 July 2021,It was a solid new take on Mortal Kombat. I enjoyed the gritty look and feel. The cast was solid and for the most part they looked and portrayed the Video game characters well. The plot was a bit weak and it lost steam in the middle. There also wasn't as many characters as I was expecting and not everyone was fully utilized. I am curious how the franchise will continue and I am excited to see a actual Mortal Kombat tournament.,Mortal Kombat

Fight!!",Mortal Kombat
312,ghanima_atrieadies,Solid Effort,8,24 April 2021,"I thought this was great. Same basic story with some differences which isn't a bad thing. Cole is an original character (don't automatically hate him because of that) which is fine because it gives a fresh way to tell the story we all know. Still the same basic story shaken up a bit. Again, not a bad thing. That being said, Cole is a weaker character but that's because we don't know him like we do Liu or Sonya.The rest of the characters more than make up for it. The first Sonya Blade that I didn't wish dead in first 10 seconds. A great Kung Lao and Raiden. Kano cracked me up. Jax (a character who never got a good due in the pervious movies) was a nice surprise. Best of all though was Scorpion and Sub Zero's back story. Hiroyuki Sanada is one of my favorite actors and he did a great job.Only a few complaints about the movie as a whole. 1) Shang Tsung. Chin Han did a good job but Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is still the best fit for that character. Nothing that can be changed just a personal preference.2) the MK Theme.... I know it's a new movie and all but if you're gonna include it just stick to the original arrangement. New one wasn't bad but didn't have the same punch.",Mortal Kombat

I can imagine it being hard to put a successful computer game into a feature film, but I would've just liked for this film to have been longer and more detailed instead of getting the sense of it feeling rushed.",Mortal Kombat
314,craigthomas90,1995 movie is superior,5,23 April 2021,"The storyline is half hearted, and unethusiastic. It is not nearly as campy as the original 1995 version. The fighting scenes are not as dynamic; it is not as suspenseful. For it's time, the 95 version has superior special effect designs; it is used more creatively. If Mortal Kombat 2 is made, it should focus on the tournament and stop with the character development and introductions. If the acting will not be a focal point, focus on the fighting. Atempting to connect to the characters, with their soap opera acting abilities is difficult and boring. The transitions from location to location is sketchy, it is just unexplained and brushed over. I am looking for blood, gore, and great Karate/Kung-fu, I barely received any of it. I did receive a great deal of terrible acting. Far too difficult to get through. It is similar to Kong vs. Godzilla; maximize the fight scenes with chorography and CGI, which happens to be the best aspects of these movies.",Mortal Kombat

Jax, Kabal and Sub-Zero where my favorite, I have to comment on the gory and exciting bloody fatalities to be the highlight. I was pretty happy with the results, if you've played the games you'll know what to expect, unfortunately the character development wasn't good.

Maybe 7/10 As A Tribute To MK.,6,24 April 2021,I wasn't expecting this to be well written... but neither to walk out of the cinema after one hour.Nostalgia wise - it was a lot of value and they've banked on this. As a movie - it is simply boring. It is full of cliches and formulaic. Even the character for the comic relief feels forced.The last Mortal Kombat I've played was 4 so I didn't recognize a lot of the secondary characters. But yeah - fine - if you love the games it is an entertaining movie. But if you're not a MK fan or if you don't really remember them that well - it is predictable and boring.,Mortal Kombat
318,derangedxzombie,"Unfortunately, very average",4,24 August 2021,"Compared to the cult classic from the 90s, whose only faults were some cheesiness and lack of gore, this film has almost no character derived from the source material that the original had in such copious amounts. The protagonist Cole is lame and not needed in the movie, they're just a new character used as a means to forward the narrative for newcomers to the series. This could've easily been done with Liu Kang, Johnny Cage etc. The environments like Outworld are pretty lacking again no character. Reptile is lame (too literal, should be a ninja at the least with scaly skin line MK4 onwards, not a quick CGI piece quickly dispatched). Some character's are done well like Kano and Scorpion, and the effects and fight choreography are solid, but honestly? It's a let down. Just watch the 90's original, it's far better, even the not so good sequel MK2 Annihilation is feels more like Mortal Kombat.",Mortal Kombat

327,Mash-the-stampede,"""Boredom Wins. Flawless Victory. MEDIOCRITALITY!""",5,28 April 2021,"I will start with the positive. The opening and closing scenes of this film are excellent!Focusing on Scorpion and Sub-zero's story was a solid high point that showcased the best this film had to offer as far as acting performances, fight choreography and interesting plot premise.Unfortunately, the 90+ minutes that occur between these 2 scenes are dull in comparison!Immediately after the exhilarating opening scene, we get introduced to brand new character; Cole Young.As a character, Cole is just blah! Boring. Un-interesting. A down-and-out underdog with no real purpose other than functioning as a major buzz-kill everytime he's on screen.Basically - Cole sucks!!!If the writers wanted to add a new character - at least make him interesting so the audience gives a s*!t about him!I would love to say that Cole is the worst thing about this film but unfortunately the ""bad"" doesn't end with him.Other MK faves are pointlessly inserted throughout the film just so the audience can say ""hey, it's Kabal - there he is"" or ""ooh, no! Here comes Goro"" but serve no real purpose outside of this!Rayden and Shang Tsung literally could have been played by anyone!They had NO personality whatsoever!Rayden could barely speak english and delivered his dialogue like it was a dress rehearsal for an amature theatre production.Shang Tsung was a generic TV villain straight out of Power Rangers!No black contact lenses could make up for the lack of ""menace"" about him.This film desperately needed Cary Tagawa back in the role of Shang Tsung - his charisma and menacing grimace was a stand-out of the 1995 original film.Heck - his performance was so good that they bought him back for MK11!Why not this film?!Outside of Sub-zero and Scorpion - the only likeable character in this film is Kano!He gets the best dialogue of all characters (I suspect much of it is improvised), had he not been in the film - that 90 minutes between the intro and ending would have been an absolute snore-fest!I realise I'm sounding overly harsh here but the thing is - Im a long time MK fan.I grew up with the original game trilogy, read the comics and watched the film's.I'm an MK fan for life and this film was an insult to MK fans everywhere!People say we need to turn our brain's off to enjoy these types of film's - but there's a difference between turning off your brain and having to get a labotomy to enjoy a movie!Very dissapointing.I hope that a sequel brings in a new team of (creative) writers, a more competent Director and that they kill off Cole within Act 1 as it would be a huge disservice having a non-canon plank of wood win the tournament!",Mortal Kombat

Screenwriter Greg Russo created a new original character, an MMA fighter Cole Young, who seeks out Earth's greatest champions in order to stand against the enemies of Outworld in a high stakes tournament for the universe. The movie shines with love for the Mortal Kombat games and it stays loyal to the lore for the most part. The fights are fun, filled with gore and magical powers, just like we imagined the games would look like in a movie as kids. Adding Cole was sadly a mistake - he adds nothing.

I definitely think the writing and directing could have been MUCH better. The cgi was decent enough but definitely shows that they're not high budget cgi. I think the music score cost more than the rest of it, but it feels ""off."" The score feels like it's made for this high impact movie, highly emotional movie, but that's not the case. The language is also another negative for me. The cuss words are definitely deserving to be said at some points but I felt like they used them too much and not always in the right spots.One plus is Kano. Kano was great, acting and writing. I think him and Scorpion provide the best acting compared to the rest. Even with the average acting overall, the lower budget feel and all the negatives I have for it, it's still fun to watch. I would put it as maybe a slightly better version of the first mortal kombat film and 1000x better than the second MK film.I'll watch it again but, even with our extreme advancements in CGI these days, don't get your hopes up too high and you'll enjoy it too.",Mortal Kombat

I liked the Japanese and Chinese language corrections they made to the Hasashi/Bi Han story, but otherwise the script was worse than the MK Legacy one. Too much try-harding to make everyone ""cool"" turned most characters to trash. Ridiculous attempts to shove in some lines from the game where they didn't belong. First two movies were cheesy as hell, but once you accepted that, you could actually take most characters seriously within that framework. Here people are too busy trying to be cool to take their roles seriously and embody this ""we are part of a war of parallel worlds that could mean total destruction for our side"".I can't believe they actually made a Mortal Kombat movie that's worse than the 90s ones, I was sure this would be at least decent, at least on par with watching the video game cutscenes, but there we have it: a new low.",Mortal Kombat

The WolverineI watched this film at the cinema by accident. Me and my girlfriend went to go see ""Godzilla Vs. Kong"", but when we arrived it turned out that the hall where it was being shown was closed for some kind of repair. Mortal Kombat was the only other film playing that night, and I was quite suspicious at first because this game probably has the worst reputation when it comes to plot and movie adaptations, but I remembered that the trailer looked cool, so we went anyway. It turned out to be a pleasant surprise.For those of you who don't know, MK is based on a fighting game franchise that is 29 years old now, and is famous for it's gore, blood and violence. So, if you aren't into that kind of thing - I wouldn't watch it; and according to my gf it probably would seem quite bad for you plot-wise if you never played the game either. But as a person who played the games, knows most of the characters and fatalities and understands the references they made - I really liked what they did with the film. Let's be honest, nobody who knows what ""Mortal Kombat"" is would come for the plot; we come to see these epic fights on the big screen, and we got them, excellently choreographed too (the fight choreographer Chan Griffin worked on The Wolverine, Pirates of the Caribbean, Aquaman, Shazam, Thor: Ragnarok and THE SPONGEBOB MOVIE..). They also took some of the most satisfying and visually appealing combos and fatalities from the game and brought them to life; and they kept the age-old Sub-Zero and Scorpion rivalry as one of the main plot elements.Gore, funny (at times) and action - overall very faithful to the game franchise and already generally loved by the fans.

That would make a freaking good plot.And when it comes to the budget and special effects of this movie, why the heck did they even bother. A homeless guy would do a more decent job than this. We are in 2021 for crying out loud, this effects, music and fight choreography are even subpar to the original movies.Zero effort, so I will give 1 star for lazy movie making.

354,TheOnlyOwen01,A cinematic abomination in every sense of the word,1,27 August 2021,"Video game adaptations are notorious for being terrible. With a couple of exceptions that have managed to become cult classics over the years as well as decently received children's films such as the Sonic movie and Detective Pikachu, I can't think of one solid adaptation. One of those cult films is Mortal Kombat (1995). A film that I personally am not a fan of but I totally understand the appeal so when I heard there was a reboot coming along that would be R rated and more true to the games, I had hope for it.Unfortunately, Mortal Kombat (2021) is a disaster on all fronts. With it's nonsensical plot, terrible performances, atrocious effects, dull as dirt characters and uninspired production design, I was in utter shock at how bad this film is. This is the biggest disaster of the 2021 slate of films by far. Not only is this the worst Mortal Kombat movie, it's the worst video game movie I've seen period. You could say that Annihilation is a worse movie but at least I can laugh at how bad that film is. I can't with this film.The biggest issue of the movie is that it has no idea why Mortal Kombat is beloved and popular. I'm not a fan of the franchise but I am full aware why it's iconic in the video game industry. It seems the filmmakers think all people want is gory violence and fatalities as well as cramming in an absurd amount of pointless easter eggs and fan service but there's more to it than that. Mortal Kombat is beloved for it's storytelling the games offered as well as it's lore, world, and diverse cast of characters. But I guess the filmmakers didn't see the clear as air reason for it's success.I'll give you an example of how out of touch they are: a lot of people were upset about Johnny Cage not being in the film and being replaced by a random made up character named Cole Young (who I'll get to soon). The reason Cage isn't here is because the producers didn't feel comfortable having a white male lead for this film and wanted something for diverse which is stupid because of two reasons: First of all, Johnny Cage is not the main character of Mortal Kombat, Lui Kang is. And second, Mortal Kombat already has a diverse cast of characters. This further backs up my point as to why the filmmakers are clueless with this franchise.Then we have the characters. Not a single one of them are likable and relatable in the slightest. Most of them serve no purpose other than to dump exposition and to be there for fan service. Sub Zero and Scorpion are the most tolerable but they're barely in the movie. And yes, I know early on that they weren't in the original character lineup and they were added in later on due to fan backlash and when you watch this movie, it really shows. The other characters are so forgettable that they're not even worth mentioning. The only one that has any form of personality is Kano and even he's not very compelling.But the worst character is none other than the lead Cole Young. Now I've given Rey a lot of trash and I think it's justified, I don't think she's a very interesting protagonist. I've also given Captain Marvel a lot of heat but at least these two characters were functional as protagonists. Cole Young is just a loser. He's completely devoid of personality, his powers are terrible, Lewis Tan gives an awful performance, he has no character arc or development and he is so carbon copy and boring that he might as well be a mute. He is one of the weakest protagonists I've ever seen and with the number of bad protagonists out there, that's saying a lot.The visual effects and production design is absolutely HORRIBLE. The greenscreen is laughably noticeable and the CGI is so ugly and cartoonish that it makes you want to vomit. The sets are uninspired and fake looking and the costumes are downright cosplay material. Lacking any grit to them and feeling like they were slapped together really quickly by a thirteen year old. There's also the lousy action set pieces. Why do filmmakers think it's a good idea to have absurd amounts of jump cuts to the point where you can't tell what's going on because that's exactly what's happening here. I remember there was an article that came out that said that this film would have the best action sequences in movie history and I knew it would just be a marketing gimmick and I was so right.On an overall scale, Mortal Kombat (2021) is one of the worst films I've ever seen. There isn't a single redeeming aspect to this movie minus a solid performance from Hiroyuki Sanada at the beginning but like I said, he's barely in the film. Soulless, pandering to the fans, pretending to understand the source material, absolutely devoid of substance and completely detached from it's audience in every possible way, this film is a disaster. I can't imagine anyone who's not a fan enjoying this and since this film doesn't understand the source material, there's no way to connect to it. This feels more like a straight to DVD martial arts film starring Scott Adkins and Bruce Willis rather than a Mortal Kombat movie. All this was was mindless fan service and franchise maintenance but since few people saw it and even fewer liked it, good luck with that sequel WB. A total waste a time.",Mortal Kombat

361,jaredkjacoby,"A Not-so Flawless Victory, but still a Victory",6,24 April 2021,"After Bi-Han leads a group of assassins to murder the members of Hanzo Hasashi's clan as well as his family, he is taken to the Neatherealm by Bi-Han. However, his youngest son survived the attack and is saved by Raiden. Shang Tsung wants to end the Earthrealm before the tenth tournament begins because he believes they have already won because of the lack of champions from the other side. It is up to MMA fighter Cole Young along with other classic MK characters such as Sonya Blade, Liu Kang and Jax to stop Shang Tsung and his warriors.Although I do not consider myself the biggest fan of Mortal Kombat, I love the lore and the characters. They have such interesting backstories and personalities that I cannot help but feel drawn to this universe. Also, the world of MK in general is interesting to boot. Some of the movies for the franchise have been good, some of them have been quite awful to say the least. I was looking forward to this film because of the fact that we were finally getting an R-rated Mortal Kombat movie. Does it deliver or is this just another video game movie misfire?The characters are a mixed bag. Sonya Blade is really cool in this film, much more so than the '90s film. She feels like a leader, she is much more effective in battle and the actress playing as her did a great job. I also felt bad for her at one point in the movie because she was treated kind of poorly at times. Kano is a riot. He is the comic relief and he is going to crack the audience up. He can also become a badass when he needs to be. Kung Lao and Liu Kang are in this film and they are very cool. Their movesets here are faithful to the games with Liu Kang's Bicycle Kick and any move from Kung Lao involving his hat. They even got one of Kang's fatalities dead on. Sub-Zero was a menacing villain here. I never remembered him being this evil, but he is still an effective villain. He also looks awesome here.However, not all characters here work. Scorpion feels so underused in favor of the boring and dull protagonist, Cole Young. He has a lot of similar characteristics that heroes from action-packed blockbuster movies have. He has a family, he is trying to find himself and he has to protect them. Lack of personality aside, he is not even an effective fighter. He beats one with luck and then has to be saved. My friend made an interesting observation on the character in that Cole is the viewer reacting as if he is in the Mortal Kombat world. In that sense, Cole could be incredibly relatable, but he still made for a dull protagonist. As for the villains, they are cool, but underdeveloped. They do not have a lot of screen time at all.What about the fight scenes? They kick ass! They are shot and edited so expertly and they use all of the visuals they have to make them standout. The choreography is spot on. I could tell that this cast prepared for this movie. The fatalities are gleefully gory. There is one in particular that had my jaw drop on the ground with how far they went with the gore. They did not waste the R rating here. The visuals mostly look amazing with the lush backgrounds, sets and costumes. Some of the sets and fights looked realistic to some degree. However, not all of them are perfect. Liu Kang's fire looked kind of questionable. Most of the effects look great though and the cinematography is gorgeous. The soundtrack is terrific with remixes of the Mortal Kombat themes and a fantastic musical score during both the fights and the quiet scenes.One problem I have with this movie is the tonal shifts. Aside from Kano, the movie starts out too serious, but the third act turns the story into a cheesefest. On top of the over-the-top gore, there are cheesy but awesome one-liners, jokes cracked by the main characters and bombastic villains. I wish this tone was consistent because once it embraced the zaniness of the world of Mortal Kombat, the movie got much better. However, it took itself too seriously at first when dealing with Cole's family. The story itself is fine, but the pacing is where the problem comes in. It starts out as a slowburner, but then it throws everything at the viewer in the third act. I know this might sound like something people say often, but I think this movie could have benefited from a longer runtime. The world of Mortal Kombat is huge and there is a lot to explore and fights to be had. Maybe the more villainous characters could be developed more too.Overall, Mortal Kombat works for what it is. It is an adaptation of a violent, popular fighting game series that delivers on the gore and the lore. Still, it lacked the right script to make it truly shine. Still, it is incredibly faithful to the series and it makes for a very fun action movie on its own. It also helps that there is a very diverse cast that is properly utilized for the most part. This is much better than either of the MK movies in the '90s. If you are a Mortal Kombat fan, this is definitely a movie worth checking out.However, it is a very graphic movie so if it might be difficult to get through if you are a little squeamish to gore. Seriously, if you have a son or daughter who wants to watch this movie, make sure they are old enough and that they understand how messy the movie will get.",Mortal Kombat

Rest of the movie experience depends on its viewer taste. The next thing to cheer in the movie is Kano's satirical portrayal which worked out at times. Last but not the least the movie provides a hopeful end teasing more heroes to be involved in the future.Coming to negatives, the movie has a bunch of them starting from acting performances where most of the lead actors felt weak and forced. To me the movie slowly gets degraded from there own turning the whole thing into a b grade movie with average CGI and bad vfx. The whole movie feels extremely rushed with underdeveloped characters who are developed in a rush degrading the whole experience. There is a wide range of b grade fight sequences in the movie where some are interesting and some are truly terrible. Overuse of background score was extremely irritating at times giving it the extreme b grade shade. The biggest disappointment was naming it Mortal Kombat and missing the tournament style.In the end, Mortal Kombat feels like a disastrous test dose attempt of pushing all characters to their accuracy just before starting the actual things in the future.Rating:39%",Mortal Kombat

But what gets portrayed on screen is what it's about. They needed to exemplify some fighting styles in martial arts to it's best, such as jujitsu, crane, snake, drunken fist, nunchaks, tonfa, karate and many others. Cause honestly this is Mortal Kombat, not just two punches and two slaps and that's it . But overall it ain't a bad movie, don't get me wrong, it's survived somehow to be an above average nice movie .",Mortal Kombat

385,ryanlion-38514,Decent but most will agree original is better,5,28 April 2021,I appreciated some aspects of the film. Sub-Zero and Raiden I thought were great. Still like the previous ones better. Otherwise I felt alot of the characters were bland. Too much attetion to some characters like Kano who I felt talked too much took too much time and again original character was better. Some scenes just overdrawn or not necessary. It makes me want to view the original again. Why was Raiden so different? Some characters like Johnny Cage missing and others added like other reviewers stated like maim character not good. I agree should of been centered around johny cage or liu kang. It is still watchable. It was one of the better 2020-2021 movies so far as they have been very few anf far in between.,Mortal Kombat
386,alexleizerovichcoaching,Big fan of MK,7,23 April 2021,"I've played MK 1,2,3, 4 when it came out so I am biased.The good:
Sub zero is great and a force to be feared. The actor playing him is the dude from warrior and does a great job.Kano is very good aswell and funny like hell.I like Mechad brooks from Supergirl as Jax. This tough guy persona works good for him.Sonya Blade is ok.The final battle was amazing and well balanced strength wise. They didnt make Sub zero weak suddenly which is a good move.As a total experience this movie is better than the 90's versions(not including conquest series which is something else).The bad:
Cole is the main character in here. I like the actor but it doesnt work for me to have him as lead it feels off.Liu Kang is there but feels like a side character which is wrong sorry.Raiden and Shang tsung are not great. They are missing depth.Kitana and Johnny cage are not in the movie. They are saving them for the sequel probably. But you cant have the story of MK1-2 with Mileena, Goro etc but no Kitana or Cage.It feels a bit like a spinoff frankly because in the main timeline Liu kang, Kitana, Cage, Sonya are the main characters(Jax appears only later on).In here you get Cole, Sonya, Kano, Sub zero, Scorpion...Anyways its still a good movie but an improved MK2 would be great. With Cole as the main lead it feels weird. So they better switch back to Liu kang.",Mortal Kombat
387,Gorillaboi,Mortal Kombat fans will enjoy it,6,25 April 2021,"This movie is far from perfect, but it's important to note that it doesn't pretend to be. It knows its main focus is in its hand-to-hand combat action, and in that regard it delivers a somewhat decent product for its target audience.I do, however, believe it could have done a better job in terms of pacing and plot structure. We know this possible to do without compromising the action (because the 1995 Mortal Kombat movie did so). But this 2021 version instead abruptly jumps from one fight scene to another without there being any lead-up.I do also believe there is lots of material in the MK franchise to have actually made a series of movies - instead of rushing the stories and character arcs into one. The characters have interesting backgrounds which, if explored, could have made the events of the film more meaningful and of more substance. And on the topic of characters, the main lead in this is completely unnecessary. The game itself, as mentioned, has amazing characters. There really was no need to introduce an entirely new person that viewers care very little for. If it instead focused on Scorpion (who has a very strong introduction), this movie would have been far better.(That said, Kano was brilliant in this. Whoever wrote his character and his lines, deserves props. He was surprisingly hilarious)But back to the plot, in its defence I guess it didn't have the time or budget to the things I recommended. Maybe they had just one shot to make a movie that would be enjoyed by the general masses. And with that in mind, they created a product with cool fight scenes, affects and costumes.",Mortal Kombat

However, this movie was an extremely fun watch that set a good foundation for an entire franchise in the future.Opening scene is beautiful. Characters like Sub Zero, Kano, Jax, Kung Lao and Sonya definitely steal the show. Besides the writing, the character of Cole Young is a hot mess. Just a complete waste of screen time. Get rid of him.Overall, I had a great time watching. The fighting, the effects, the fan service made it an enjoyable watch and I'm anxious for a sequel and for films beyond it. I am confident that with a bigger budget, a better writing team and a new director that can pull more compelling acting out of the actors, the movie will elevate itself even higher.",Mortal Kombat
389,ethantoy,Decent Reboot to a Beloved Franchise,6,24 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat (2021) is in simplest terms: good. It isn't great, nor is it terrible. I personally enjoyed much of the movie for what it was worth. I definitely could tell you off the bat that if you're a fan of the games and the old films, you will appreciate this new addition to the series. It's fine in its own right but it lacks in cinematic story. The pacing of the movie is ridiculously fast, and I mean fast- it will flip flop over and over, with incredibly bland dialogue and corny conversations. There's a ton of work on story that seemed to be dropped for tighter choreography and better CGI use, but it's not that great of a decision. I feel that the funnest part of the film was the action, and that's about it. It's got your violence, your gore, and your fight sequences: all realms of what makes Mortal Kombat. However, it is very off-beat with its own lore and the director made odd decisions to certain character arcs that were not necessarily needed.In terms of CGI and violence on this movie. There isn't a lot of it, and that's kind of a let down for some people. It's got a fair amount of fatalities and trademark kills, but it is very few and far between. When these events do happen, they're pretty quick to cut out the rest of the damage (assuming it was because the studio was attempting to cease a rating of NC-17), yet they were satisfying. You will be impressed with the roster used in the movie, aside from a new addition who I found to actually be quite unique and very cool after all.Script and plot was what dropped this film's ball. It had a great opening, it seemed to know where it was going in terms of direction, but until the second act- this whole script becomes nonexistent to the Mortal Kombat lore, which as contradicting as this is, it is the closest to the lore as well. There are just story changes that are bizarre and unnecessary, it's very ""director"" interfered and I can tell that he had a biased agenda for some characters in the film. It's ok, but the preferences and retcons that were made are absolutely bad. I found myself quite disappointed.SPOILER TERRITORY:
I must admit, the idea of Cole being a descendant of Scorpion's family bloodline is incredibly unique and new to the lore, I like this idea because it gives everyone an opportunity to appreciate Cole as a character.That being said, the decision to make Sub-Zero, a villain (the MAIN villain) at that, was purely biased and it's a confusing and bewildering decision. I love both the characters, Scorpion and Sub-Zero, but to flip the roles purely to fit preference is just disrespectful to the actual game series itself. I may seem immature for this opinion, but if you're going to make a video game adaptation, please stick to it and don't change arcs simply because. I must admit to the actors that portrayed these characters, they did a phenomenal job for what time they had. Scorpion maybe has 15 minutes of total screen time, and Cole being a descendant, steals the screen time for the majority of this runtime. It's disappointing to say the least.The roster was surprisingly decent as well, even if the majority were sided and only shown off barley. It was still fan-service to include Kabal and Nitara. I thought that was super cool. There are definitely more characters, but they're mainly in one moment of a scene and gone the next. It's very adjacent to the idea of a sequel being developed.Should there be a sequel? Absolutely. I think that Mortal Kombat (2021) is far better than the originals when it comes to fan service and respect to the game's universe (even if there are a few missteps along the way) and I would totally be willing to give Director Simon another shot at making a sequel. However, I'd hope he'd not retcon the lore as rough as he did here. It's a good movie, guys, and it's great for the time it's on. It's a fast-paced, gory action film that offers everyone a little bit of everything. But perhaps it was better to give everyone everything they could get instead of sheltering it for a tight runtime that will eventually turn itself into a sequel.",Mortal Kombat

It was actually insulting that they had to add a audience character to the story as if we couldn't grasp the ""deep and complex"" story that Mortal Kombat isn't known for, pretty sure we can all figure out who the original characters are of Mortal Kombat by now. Cole never even grew as a character and just got angry? Coles ""special power"" was completely lame and looked like a cheap rubber suit on screen. They literally gave armor to a character that had plot armor, kind of Ironic and ridiculous. The Scorpion story was completely unnecessary and adding nothing to the story and never really touched based with later in the film. Goro was in the film for a few minutes and it was an completely underwhelming fight and introduction to the series. All the other characters were mediocre at best and didn't really make the film.

Because in reality it can be improved in many ways.The main plot is confusing and superficial. The story line never reaches a conclusion. Where is the tournament?? In the end everything is a bad justification to show a couple of fatalities and to be able to add some lines stolen from video games.The film has some good sequences and others not so good, showing that the fights and the visual effects were worked with uneven effort. The character design is good, although the antagonists are just actors being mannequins to add visuals and special effects. There are scenes where there is a lot of unnecessary blood and others where more blood is needed. By the way, there were few grotesque scenes.

401,StrayFeral,I was expecting much much more,5,6 May 2021,"Problem is, the first MK movie was a hit. And it was good. They had all the cool characters, nice cast, legendary music and cool tournament, just as the game did. While the second movie did not really repeat the success, MK fans still reference to the first movie. We had the tv show which was nice, then recently came ""Scorpion's Revenge"", which was very nice and now this movie, which is a huge disappointment.First - the bad things. I was expecting the tournament. The tournament is the culmination of every MK story. No tournament here, just separate battles. Nothing epic. Then is the cast. Cole Young was not bad, but it was Kano, Kung Lao and Sonya who excelled. Everything else was real disappointment, most of which was the music. Hell at least put a good music! True, music was not bad, it was good, but galaxies away from the legendary beats of Utah Saints. To be honest, in the beginning of the final credits, you hear the Utah Saints chords striking and... what you hear next is emotionless crap of sound. And in the end, there are Scorpion and Sub-Zero - they were not bad, but they were seriously crippled towards the end of the movie. I really expected so much more.Now the good things. Visuals are of course good for a modern movie. Music is not bad, just not what it was supposed to be. In general - good fight scenes choreography. Especially the very first scene in the movie - I watched it two times, it was really well done and we see the origin of the famous Scorpion weapon. Then we have the cast and characters of Sonya, Kano and Kung Lao, which were really well done, Kano especially! And in general it is amusing movie, so if you want to kill some time, go ahead.

403,phobicsq,Worse than I expected but it had some violence,3,12 May 2021,"After many years and many games we finally got another MK film and it was not very good. The people who made this film clearly don't know much about the game or even tried to follow the lore. Sure, there was some MK stuff in this film but it tried hard to be something else. Many decisions made on this film confuse me as a fan of MK since it first hit the arcade in the 90's. The 95 film, with all of it's flaws, it far superior to this film on almost every level -minus no violent fatalities.The web series (legacy) was actually good and it's a shame that it wasn't continued but instead we got this trash.The Bad:Cole is a terrible character and should never had been in the film. I have no idea why they made a new character when MK has so many who could have anchored the film.So many wasted characters like Reptile, Goro, Reiko, Mileena, Kintara, and let's not forget there was no Johnny Cage.How the fighters got their powers was really lame and even topped the animality crap from the 2nd movie.Having no actual tournament and keeping the fighters in a ""cave"" for a good portion of the film was beyond dumb.Scorpion is nowhere in the film except the beginning and end (though he seems weak) which is a shame because they set him up big time.Cole's wife and daughter can survive being frozen in ice but scorpions family can't? Seriously dumb storytelling.Not very many fatalities and not pit fatality when they were on the pit!The fights and fighting were sub-par at best and too much ""tag-teaming"".The music was terrible and no iconic MK song.The Good:There's some violence/gore but not as much as I expected.

You're a big fan of the Mortal Kombat series, or 2. You like hard R action movies and want to see some gore. If you still don't see a reason to watch this movie, you should not watch this movie. I haven't played any of the games and didn't know much about the Mortal Kombat universe, but I still wanted to watch some gore go down. You can clearly see this movie is made for the die hard fans. The dialog feels like it's straight out of the games with the one-liners and monologues. This makes the fight scenes awesome, but the filler scenes a bit hard to watch at times. The non fighting scenes in general aren't the greatest story building moments. There is little to no character development and the acting is also questionable at times. The reason why I'm still giving a positive score is purely for the action scenes, and especially the takedowns are incredible. I fully delivered on that front and my only complaint there is that there aren't more of them and less filler story moments.

Every scene they're in you can feel the power, the emotion, the connection. They both are A-level talent with incredible acting abilities. They both have that natural ability to grab the audience's attention. It doesn't matter who was the good guy, bad guy, you cheer for them both. It's like watching two different movies when these two were on the screen and an entirely different movie without them on the screen.I've read others suggesting they to need immediately replace the other actors.

I've been playing the video games since the 90's and I am 100% the target demographic for this movie. If you are like me, you will enjoy the movie. If you are not like me, you probably won't (nor should you).Watching the movie is like you're experiencing a playthrough of a new MK game on story mode. All dialogue just serves as a filler between fight scenes.

411,ryanwesthamfan,Cool action but very cheesy,6,26 May 2021,"The Good- Delivers on the blood and gore that you expect from an R rated Mortal Kombat film right from the first scene. The film also gives us some nice mythology including the opening sequence. This is a film that knows it is dumb, so naturally there are plenty of fight and hard R action and quite a bit of the dialogue are one liners.The Mixed- It is very inconsistent when it comes to the action, acting and characterisation. Some of the action is pretty nice including the final fight. But some of the fights were very simple and the editing was very rough on the edges. Some of the characters I thought were very overused and others were just there and didn't really add anything new.The Bad- This film can come across as very cheesy when trying to be serious. My biggest issue with this film is that it is a movie about a Mortal Kombat tournament that avoids the Mortal Kombat tournament. It's like they were trying to set up a franchise and it didn't work as it ended up sabotaging its own film. It's not a film that bored me I was entertained at parts but at the end of it I wasn't 100% satisfied with it.I had more fun with this film than it sounds it delivered on the parts I expected it to deliver on. Overall I'm going to give Mortal Kombat a 6/10 and if your a fan of Mortal Kombat then you should probably check it out.",Mortal Kombat
412,kuner-59029,Corporate fast food,2,23 April 2021,"The trailer already had me worried. The tropes and hallmarks of uninspired corporate filmmaking and sloppy writing were all over this: Orphaned main protagonist, ""chosen one"" plot device, washed out color grading, race swapped and weirdly designed characters (Reptile), cgi overkill. But some of the shots were nicely composed, they went for the gore, and everyone involved seemed passionate, so I had some hope.Then I saw the movie. The first few minutes started quite promising. The scene in Japan lacked a good setup and context, but the direction wasn't bad. The score on the other hand stuck out like a sore thumb. This makes some of the bad marvel scores sound like Beethoven. The score is all over the place, going from Orchestral epic to dubsteppy electronica, leaving scene feel totally disjointed. It's also used badly in a story and character context.Right after one character suffers a tragedy, the music is melancholy orchestra. Then it goes straight into techno with dubstep basslines for an action scene. A better composer would have taken the sorrow theme and worked that into the action scene, to show the character turning his sorrow into rage. Instead they're trying to hype up the audience ""they're fighting! This is cool!""
This worked in the 1995 version because that movie knew it was shlock. This one can't decide what it wants to be until halfway through.The movie then actually starts strong. The first encounter with the villain is excellent. Joe Taslim is the highlight of the movie, his Sub-Zero is absolutely menacing und unpredictable. Whenever he's on screen, the film lives and the stakes can be felt.The initial plot setup really works. The new protagonist fits into the narrative, though there is no mystery over who he is. Tournament, heroes have to defend the Earth against Shang Tsung and his Outworld champions. Okay, same plot as the game and original movie.Except it's not. The entire rest of the movie takes place in a cave. Where the 95 original felt grand and colorful in scope with a multitude of colors, setpieces and locations, here we get... orange rock. More orange rock. A shack somewhere. And a warehouse.The Mortal Kombat games are known for their epic scope and imaginative settings and worldbuilding. Here we get locations designed for a Steven Seagal movie.Once they reach the cave, the movie just gives up. The narrative grinds to a halt. The setups from early on (tournament etc) are irrelevant. Raiden, played with such charm and spirit by Christopher Lambert in 95 has no function here. He barely has any lines and the acting is awful. Shang Tsung as well is horribly miscast and milquetoast. No comparison to Hiroyuki-Tagawa's delightfully evil and sadistic bad guy in 95. In this film he just looks sad and constipated with his costume weighing the poor actor down.The villains mostly just grunt and yell. Even in MK Armageddon the villains had more lines and character development than here.There is one exception: Kano. This actor is having a blast, and was the only thing keeping the movie watchable for much of its runtime. The actor had big shoes to fill and fill them he did. Kano even had a bit of a character arc, unlike every other character in this film. The protagonist more or less disappears for the entire middle of the film, until you almost forget he exists.The end of the movie is just fight scenes ad nauseum. Thought MK Annihilation was tiring? This is paced even worse with characters you know even less about. At least MK Armageddon had interesting locations to spice things up.There is zero plot for the last 45 minutes. The narrative grinds to a total halt. No character development, no story beats. People prepare to fight and then fight. While the fight scenes are competently made, the CGI looks bad for the most part.The music joes goes off on a tangent. It barely fits in any scene. Whoever hired Benjamin Wallfisch should be fired.All of this is a shame, because the director is clearly passionate, but his reach exceeded his grasp. The film was poorly written, badly shot, terribly scored, way under budget and at least half of the actors were miscast.The video game movie curse remains. Out of all games, Mortal Kombat, Tomb Raider and Assassin's Creed had the biggest potential to be great. How did Hollywood screw up all 3?If you're a fan, watch it for Sub-Zero and Kano and the gory death scenes. Everyone else is better off sticking to Mortal Kombat 1995.",Mortal Kombat
413,david_royz,A film for fans of the game,6,24 April 2021,"Doesn't really follow the tried and tested 3-act formula. After the first 10 minute set-up, it's just a bunch of fights amongst a bunch of conversations. There's no real character development and the ""finale"" doesn't feel any more grand than the middle of the film.Pretty much every Australian knows a Kano. He's a true Aussie larrikin and the most interesting character in the film. But his humour and foul mouth just gets tedious, much like some of the special effects.Overall the film will likely please fans of the video game. It's violent, bloody, action packed and reasonably well paced. But for movie buffs expecting a big blockbuster, it falls a little short.",Mortal Kombat

People complained about the editing in the bourne movies being fast paced but this has to be the best example of the WORST action editing in the history of cinema.With films like John Wick, Atomic Blonde, Kate... in fact any number of western movies nowadays which has a good grip on how to edit action I cannot believe the audience still has to sit through this sh&t.The irony is... it's a fight movie...about a tournament of fighters... they hired decent martial arts actors and rather than allowing them to show what they can do they chop it up to the point that it's unwatchable. I started counting the number of edits/camera changes during one combination of strikes and got to 9... there doesn't need to be 9 edits in an entire fight scene with the talent they have.Now I know you don't watch this sort of movie for the dialogue and the actors but Christ, these characters are less 2d than the original game. They aren't funny, they aren't engaging, they aren't interesting, the longer I watched the more I felt my brain cells giving up on life.Now the trailer looked promising and that's because they took the best editing from the first fight scene (maybe the directors day off) but very quickly you realise that's the last of the good stuff...Avoid at all costs.

I believe a lot of thought process went into how to present it to the modern audience who are familiar with the recent video-games, I think it does a good job in entertaining.The movie by all means is not Perfect, it has it's flaws, but it moves in such a pace that it never feels like it's dragging for too long.I have heard that this is a part of trilogy, I am on board for the second one and i hope they improve on everything they put on display here.Giving time to Sub-Zero & Scorpion is like a dream come true and the fight scenes are awesome, I would watch this just for entertainment, which is exactly what this type of movie should be.Rating 6/10.",Mortal Kombat

Quick spurts of martial arts only to give way to a fatality of some sort.The main character leaves much to be desired and even more to understand where, how, and who he is. Even then without spoiling this movie the truth is that this a failure at portraying Mortal Kombat. While it may be hard to adapt game to movie, this was a perfect example of what not to do. Do not stray too far from original story, do not fill the movie with every character you can, etc.The only saving grace for this movie was some of the acting, a majority of special effects, Kano's humor, and a few other things, worth the one time watch but not in theatres - wait to stream, or rent.",Mortal Kombat

Many people are bashing the addition of the new main protagonist as well as the fact that the story did not remain loyal to the original. But let's face it, the premise of Mortal Kombat has been overused so many times in different movies and animations. Of course they had to go for something different this time and it worked. What makes this movie good is the fact that it managed to turn an original goofy video game storyline into something serious and sensible. The Tournament between two worlds were well explained. It is through this movie that we properly understand how and why the outer dimension has been trying to cheat against Earth through any means possible. The acting was great and the character writing was standard. I appreciated Sonya's role as someone who did not need to be ""a chosen one"" to save the day. There were no silly lines and terrible jokes. Most of the jokes were well timed as well. The strongest point for the movie was the CGI, editing and action scenes. The only thing I hated about the movie was the death of Kung Lao. It was cheap and not even needed. Apparently, the writers forgot that Kung Lao has a large fan base like Liu Kang. However, unlike Liu Kang, Kung Lao has barely gotten any meaningful appearance in mainstream. This was his first major but his exit was terrible. The writers just wanted an emotional connection with the loss of the heroes and to show us how dangerous the villains are. It was disappointing to say the least.",Mortal Kombat

Spot on! The second thing I'd like to mention is that I am a die hard Mortal Kombat fan, as in, I have played it since I was 6, and I have read comic books, and I have seen every video about MK on Youtube. So...Let's get technical. Nice CGI, fantastic casting in some roles, terrible in others. Dialogues are mediocre at best; even the good ones. And I get that it is an adaptation, but why did they have to change stupid little facts? Bi Han cuts Jax's hands off? Raiden is supposed to be the wise and calm thundergod, and tall; specifically, in the timeline the movie is trying to present. Hanzo is killed by Bi Han, Harumi too, who's the kid saved from Shirai Ryu? So I guess they had to somehow relate Cole to Hanzo.I gotta say I am not annoyed by the big adaptation diversions, but it is the small details that bother me. Fight scenes are good though. Overall, if you wanted to make a good movie, why did you have to change it? If it ain't broke, don't fix it mate.To be fair, they had some really good moments though!

The trailer for this thing looked cool. Lots of awesome fight choreography and special effects. There was even that R-rating which appeared to be giving fans exactly what they want. Unfortunately, the experience of watching this movie is far from satisfying. I wanted a fun rollercoaster ride of a picture -- didn't need to be oscar-worthy or anything, heck, just as long as you made it enjoyable with enough humor, martial arts action, and gory fatalities, would've been fine with me. What I got was long, drawn-out scenes where characters dump exposition, bland actors that seem to lack pulse and vibrancy, flat cinematography, and a nonsensical story that goes absolutely nowhere.

If you are going into the movie expecting an Oscar winning script or Oscar performances from actors, then you will be disappointed.If you are hoping for a decent screenplay based on the video game with good fight scenes, screen adaptions of your favourite characters and improved choreography and CGI compared to previous Mortal Kombat movies, then you will enjoy this movie. Based on those criteria and scoring this movie from an entertainment point of view, I would give it an 7/10 - I would have loved to have heard the original theme from the 1995 movie in this.I personally didn't have high expectations for this movie due to the fact that very few video games have had good screenplay adaptions. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the job the producers have done for this movie.Although I did not know some of the actors, I thought the casting of the characters was perfect and loved seeing the job they did with them. I especially loved the screen adaptions of the characters special moves... they were a joy to behold. Kano was also surprisingly very funny and the producers did a great job including some of the characters catchphrases. The fictional worlds were also impressive looking in the movie.If you are a fan of the Mortal Kombat game, and you enjoyed the 1995 movie, then this movie is definitely for you. If you are looking for a cheesy entertaining movie to watch then you can't really go astray either with this.

444,adhipar,"A decent reboot, a journey not a tournament",7,26 April 2021,"Judging from the previous MK movies, I set my expectation low, thinking only the duel between Scorpion and Sub-Zero will be fun to watch. I'm not entirely wrong, but other fights are quite OK.Not like the previous MK installment, this movie is not about a tournament, but a journey for some of the character. It's open with a fight between Hanzo vs Bi Han, and we aware the final battle will be between them too. Then there' are stories about Jax, Sonya Blade and Cole Young becoming MK fighters. The main plot is about Cole Young's journey and it gives fresh angle about the MK universe. And I can say this plot can be developed more than just sime people gathered for a tournament. That's good.I think sub-zero is the leading character/villain. I find all the characters here are better than the old MK, except Shang Tsung. He looks like an old chinese royal, not a warrior. Well actually Liu Kang is not better than before too, but he's more like a supporting role here.My favorite characters here are Sub Zero and Sonya Blade. Sonya's plot to become a MK fighter is satisfying. I hope these two will join the next installment. I'm a bit worry about Kano, but his portrayal is ok. But overall I think the director and the script have given these characters good portions, it's only some actors deliver better than the other. The CGI and effects are also convincing. There's also a 'double team' (2 agains 1) fight just like in the game.Now, I really want to see the next one. Hopefully with better budget. More martial arts actors involved. And the screen writers has no boundary about which characters will join the sequel. The beauty of this MK universe that you can revive any characters needed by the story with some logics.I was prepare to give perhaps 4 - 6 score but after watching the movie it's a solid 7 out of 10. If you love the game, dont miss it.",Mortal Kombat
445,benmundie,"Exactly What I Expected, Still Enjoyable Though!!",7,28 May 2021,"'Mortal Kombat' is the latest film adaptation of the beloved game franchise, that was apart of many people's childhoods as their introduction to 'ultraviolence'. This is the third attempt at shifting these iconic characters over to the big screen. The first two films were in 1995 and 1997 and were not so well received, especially the sequel 'Mortal Kombat: Annihilation' which was heavily slandered for poor effects and terrible characters. This new film was helmed by Simon McQuoid in his feature length directorial debut and there are rumours that many sequels are currently in the works.This film features a lot of characters from the games, most of which I would say are accurate to the source material. The best looking are definitely 'Goro' and 'Kabal', both of which are very factual to the originals. The casting is near on perfection, in particular the always brilliant Hiroyuki Sanada as 'Scorpion' and Josh Lawson as 'Kano'. Especially in the third act, Sanada is fantastic in his role, he brings a certain stoicism at the start and then in the end he transitions into a brutal fighting machine. Also, Kano is the comic relief of the movie, Lawson plays him to perfection, and is great at conveying the same disbelief that the audience has whist watching.The main selling point of this picture is the action. A 'Mortal Kombat' film has to have thrilling, high-paced fight choreography and I'm glad to say that this rendition 100% delivers. The action set pieces are bloody, they're fast and they don't hold back on the fatalities that made the games so beloved. In my opinion, the most impressive is the final battle between Scorpion and Sub-Zero. They manage to make references to the games during the fight, but they don't come across as forced and shoehorned in, they flow naturally along side the conflict.However, the story is quite generic, which was expected going in. The writers definitely prioritise the action ahead of the writing. My main issue is the main protagonist. I don't understand why they would make 'Cole Young' (an original character, that hasn't appeared in any of the games) the primary hero. I think making either 'Scorpion' or 'Johnny Cage' (who doesn't even appear) the major lead would make more sense as people know their personalities. Cole was boring, unnecessary and one-note. Even Cole's 'power' is boring and doesn't really make sense with the character.Overall, this movie was everything I expected and if you're able to shut your mind off and just enjoy the film, you'll have a blast. It has been reported that there could be up to ten sequels in the works and honestly I can't wait.7/10.",Mortal Kombat
446,RaymanHortse,Fatality!... in a good way.,7,16 April 2021,"We're getting more and more video-game movies that are good (some more than others) and i got satisfied with this one.Mortal Kombat presents the known story from years but with some originality touch with the characters, it gives them more personality within the minutes. VFXs are visually gorgeous, specially in slow moving scenes in which they shine, but if something shines more it's the violence and the bloody scenes, they don't cut them like in the 90s adaptation, here we have blood and even fatalities that are refferences to the games with lots of attention to details. By the way the cast is amazingly similar to the models in-game from most of the characters, very good decisions there with most of performances being good.Everything good has it's bad side, here there are some decisions that are a bit rushed and makes no sense, like for example the Hanzo's descendant which feels rushed and with no complexity. There's also the ""Astral"" the energy they need for calling their special abilities and for some is ok, but Jax and Kano is not an excuse.Good adaptation, just a few things that aren't quite the thing but i can't say they ruin the experience.

447,passan-80670,As a fan of MK I was very bored,3,25 April 2021,"TL:DR:
If you want to see some MK characters in a movie. You will like it.If you want a good action movie with ""The raid""-like choreo... you will be very dissatisfied.Also, why does Scorpion says ""Get over here!"" even thought he died hundreds of years ago in feudal japan? Did he attended an English class in hell or what?There is nothing that this movie does well.Story, writing, production (set design), cinematography, camerawork and acting are very poor. Especially Kano with his ""humor"" was enough to turn off the movie. Why do the corporate-rats from Warner Brothers like this cringe style of humor?I rate this movie on the 3 most important things that an action movie should do right. Choreography, script and editing.The choreography was mostly lame and tame. Nothing anyone did was impressive. When Scorpion fought the assassins and the first 3rd of Subzero vs Scorpion were alright. Kano vs the invisible Lizard was actually cool.The script was .. blegh. Nothing happened. The coolest moment was supposed to be Scorpion vs Subzero. But the good part of this fight lasted not even 2 minutes before it went full cliché. After that he disappeared. The ending was virtually the same as the beginning of the movie. It felt like the entire movie was meaningless.Editing was indistinguishable from any factory produced Hollywood slog. A bunch of quick cuts during the action. I lost count how many times it was impossible to tell what actually happened.The whole time I was watching MK, I kept thinking of ""The Raid"".Yes, every Raid movie has obnoxious editing, but the choreography is on point and those movies have scripts where stuff is happening moving along.",Mortal Kombat

452,ryan-44110,"Not bad, but not good either.",5,24 April 2021,"Spoilers ahead so be warned. I wish I could properly explain my grievances without them, but I can't.The entire movie we're edged into believing the main character, Cole, is going to become Scorpion. For whatever reason, the writers felt like switching allegiances with Scorpy and Sub Zero. While Zero has come packaged in villain form, he's most recently portrayed as a protagonist to combat the consistently evil Scorpion and other rival ninja factions. The entire movie seems to have continuity issues. We jump around without a whole lot of explanation. The tournament doesn't even take place. We're given a kid's sized sampler platter from Chili's of assorted good guys and bad guys... and one random 22 year old dude who somehow has a 14 year old daughter (guessing on ages). The plot isn't terrible, Shang Tsung is up to his old tricks again, and is breaking rules to try and win the tournament by default... whenever it actually happens. We get the usual good guys, Jax, Sonya, Liu, and Kung Lao is thrown in for a little zesty kick. The bad guys consist of surprise surprise... Shang, Goro (who goes down faster than a drunken prom date) Mileena, Zero, Kano, Kabal, and two extra albatrosses thrown into the mix.The plot feels flat. The movie wants you to care about this 22 year old, with his 32 year old wife, and 14 year old daughter, but I don't. I'm not moved by any of the distress or lovey dovey crap as it doesn't last long enough. Liu feels like a giant wuss unlike the previous films. None of the characters really have that much development. Feels like they tried to cram a bunch of stuff into a sub-2hour span and failed to convey any relevant plot or development.I guess they're planning on a sequel to this? I just don't really see it happening though as I don't think anyone who likes MK enough is going to want to sit through another two hours of convoluted mess with Mortal Kombat overtones. The best scenes in the movie? Literally the beginning, and the Scorpion vs Sub Zero fight at the end that they hyped in the trailers. Everything else is pretty irrelevant.",Mortal Kombat

456,syd9907,"It didn't ""Get Over Here""...It Ran Away Over There!",2,25 April 2021,"I'm giving it 2 stars for the costumes & CGI, and that's where it ends. I was so completely disappointed with this latest iteration of Mortal Kombat, I don't know where to start. I have followed the Mortal Kombat films since the first one in 1995, and by far, after 26 years, that is way better than this 2021 version, though we've come a long way with technology. And if you've never followed the films, some of the character's names won't be familiar to you.One of my favorite characters is Liu Kang. In the other films he was a serious bad-a** warrior and martial artist. This Liu Kang looked and acted like a young new-age flower child left over from the 60's. Louis Tan as Cole Young is just not a very good actor and his character was getting his butt whipped at every turn. If you're descended from the bloodline of a Ninja warrior, then for goodness sake, act like it. That character was so badly written, it was laughable. And his family...who cast them? They all looked like siblings; older brother, middle sister and younger sister. None of it was believable that this was his wife and kid. And can we talk about Subzero....he was always a character you loved to hate, yet with this Subzero, he was more irritating than anything else. The Scorpion acted as if he was just out of all his martial arts gas...his tank was empty, and his famous catchphrase ""get over here!"" landed with a thud. Raiden was like your cool uncle that can always make you feel better even when he knows you're a screw-up. This character was the most tolerable of them all.And there were characters with hardly anything to do such as Mileena, with a mouth like a monstrous man-eating Venus fly trap...why? Nitara...if you blinked you'd miss her. Then they took the Black guy Jax, had his arms frozen off and made him into something that looked like a cyborg, once again...why? And where was Kitana, who was a major character in the other films and the twin sister to Mileena? But ultimately, there was no tournament (which is at the core of the Mortal Kombat films), no real character development, no insightful explanation of the prophecy and the writers didn't make good use of the source material....this was another glaring example of Hollywood screenwriters and the powers-that-be fixing what wasn't broken.",Mortal Kombat

This movie was everything I wanted it to be. I absolutely loved it. It was very true to its source material but also new and refreshing. They stayed true to MK lore when possible but they also introduced some really interesting elements. The fans of the franchise will definitely love this movie as much as I did. It's filled with fun Easter eggs that are very appreciated. Josh Lawson really killed it as Kano and to me he was the best thing in the film. However, the movie is not perfect. I didn't really like Raiden that much, in fact he was kind of annoying.

As far as faithfulness to the source material, the film does a great job of stuffing the action full of game references and one-liners that are sure to make fans of the franchise smile.However, as a film, this is god awful. There is absolutely no sense of pacing whatsoever; the film moves at a blistering pace. The plot is almost non-existent. Instead there are lots of action sequences in which the CGI looks a little shoddy. The lack of plot may not bother others, but there are so many unexplained sequences in the film that at some point you have to shrug your shoulders and just enjoy the action sequences that have been put together. The acting is pretty bad, the dialogue is worse, and the movie ends with no story arc.It's a fun watch for making fun of the film or chilling with a bunch of your friends.

Very strange choices for actors, especially when it came to the roles of Raiden and Shang Tsung. The acting wasn't all horrible, but unfortunately for the rest of the cast, the actor who played the role of Kano (who is supposed to be a side character/ henchman of sorts) stole the movie.

The story was extremely rushed and while the plot was paper thin like it usually is in a supposed franchise-building film, I did not find myself caring about any of the characters. Viewers would find themselves enjoying a fight scene here or there and would enjoy comedic moments but aside from that, there's not much here except for an extremely predictable film with bad costume designs, bad acting and big plotholes.It focuses too much on the least interesting characters although pretty much all characters were uninteresting here except for the highlights of the film Sub-Zero by Joe Taslim and Scorpion played by Hiroyuki Sanada who were the best incarnations of these characters you can possibly ask for but what's frustrating is that they are BARELY in the film.Throughout the runtime, I kept lowering my expectations and this film failed to meet them for the most part. You can tell that they put in a decent effort to make it work but their vision just wasn't good enough in the first place.",Mortal Kombat
467,janjeltes,Mostly works,7,23 April 2021,"I strongly dislike violent movies and this movie is very graphic. Having said that, it basically works.The good. The series is a product of Konami and focussed on Asian culture and they mostly stick to that. The Australian, the blonde and the black guy are all unnecessary and I suggest the film would hav even better without them. We will pay dearly in the next film with the blond female ninja warrior.However, the story was adequate. Quite a few of the characters behaved like normal human beings. The wokeness was almost non-existent.However, the film just didn't quite work. Jessica McNamee (Sonya Blade) was teeming with narcissism and she had to restrain herself (which saved the film). Josh Lawson (Kano) was a bloody idiot who tried to be super obnoxious and succeeded. Mehcad Brooks (Jax) was a poor actor who felt deeply out of place.The last film like this I enjoyed was Fight Club, although fight club is far better than this film.If you can get past the extreme gore, there's an entertaining flick underneath.

It was scenic, well choreographed, and emotionally well acted by everyone involved. I was like, whoa! Could they really be epic storytelling here and getting away from the video game schtick? If the whole movie is like this, this is going to be GOOD!Then there was the rest of the movie. Ugh. They really had a chance here to reboot this movie and make it something of epic fantasy beyond its video game origins. The story and lore of MK with different realms having champions come together to defend their realms from Outworld, and each champion having hidden powers, well that's the makings of good epic fantasy. Your still true to the story of the game with the same character and abilities, but telling a good story on screen to boot! But, NOPE! They take all that potential and have to keep inserted the cheese like, ""TEST YOUR MIGHT"", ""FLAWLESS VICTORY"", ""KANO WINS"", and the every present ""FATALITY"" that just never lets you forget this is just a video game movie after all.

472,Krush_Burner,Expect The Unexpected,7,9 April 2021,"The main point I'd like to start with is that this is not the film about Mortal Kombat tournament, this is feels more like an origin story or rather a spin-off. Scripts deals greatly with training and team building and heritage, leaving nearly everything else behind. This certainly sets new MK apart from 1995 version let alone (epic) failed 1997 sequel. Sure, this is still Mortal Kombat, but different in some important ways.Cole Young character seems totally unneccesry as an audience surrogate, Johhny Cage (whose absence is unforgivable) or Stryker easily can replace this one to introduce unfamiliar moviegoers to MK mythology and story arc. Character designs are good (great sometimes), but most locations looks unimaginative and pale to say the least. Dialogues are... alright, let's just skip this part.But regarding the fights and its style, Mortal Kombat is an eye-candy.Most battles ends with a gruesome fatalities, hearts are ripped off, hand and legs are thrown apart. The climatic clash between Sub-Zero and Scorpion is a truly remarkable piece of maritial arts cinema. The blood and guts, basiclaly, redeems all the flaws between action sequences.

Everything is simple and straightforward, considering the lack of time and will to explain more of the Saga, in general.Taking this in consideration, the story is fast-paced, and has no intention whatsoever to make a big deal of the magnitude of this universe. This approach particularly diminishes the importance and cohesion in the plot.Therefore, the main problem of this movie is the acting, and the editing, especially on the action sequences. The effort that was drawn on every single dialogue was embarrassing.Although, the acting was sometimes forced and robotic, this film has amazing features, and punchlines from the game. Those lines and especially the graphic special (blood and extreme - r rated - combat scenes) from every character makes up for the nostalgic appeal of the movie.In overall, the film is decent, and makes the main audience drink from the pit of the nostalgic features of the game. However, the story and performance are effortless and basic for a classic game.Ps: the Scorpion scene is just so nostalgic and amazing!",Mortal Kombat

It has character development, a good plot, gore, and humor.This movie fails in many of those regards. It is peppered with some good scenes, and a great Kano to add the humor, but ultimately that isn't enough to redeem the hurried plot and curious decisions therein.Why did they center it on Cole Young, a completely new character? MK has what, 30+ characters? He has such a cliched story that I ended up kinda bored by his scenes. The addition of the special MK marks and the heres needing to find their magical power was just bad and unnecessary.Pros
-decent acting with Kano standing out.-Some cool fatalities(though not enough)
-Couple nice easter eggs for fansCons
-Some of the actors were miscast, especially scorpion, who was too old and short. The actor is great in other movies, just miscast. Also Jax should have been huge. I wish they had Michael Jai White. Dude is like 50 and still a beast.-Where the F is Kitana?-Goro CGI looks BAD. Reptile is just a velociraptor/monkey.-Plot is pretty bad
-Pacing is all over the place, often too fast, with too much exposition spoken rather than shown.-Cole Young is your generic action hero, underdog with latent abilities destined to save the world.

491,abdurehmanarshd,Doesn't add much...,3,5 May 2021,Though the movie wasn't worse and it didn't waste my time but there were some small blunders scattered throughout. First being the plot so fast and bad. Performances were below average and music was okayish. CGI seemed bad at points considering we are living in 2021 and WB produced it. Fighting sequences were quite alright and actually enjoyable. The timeline they explored didn't fit at all and kind of dimmed the love I had for video games. It was an effortless try by WB imo because they focused on sequel in film. This film failed at box office and now I doubt the sequel is coming. In short it was an okayish action funpack film with no depth or proper execution which makes it bad for me but good for action films lovers. You might actually like the Scorpion vs Subzero's epic rivalry but there's nothing special in it.,Mortal Kombat

The fatalities and finishing moves were cool and I liked the few gory fatalities.The worst part about this was a new central character who means nothing to Mortal Kombat fans and dominates the story. It got progressively cheesier to almost rival the terrible 90's attempts.I know you can't please everyone when doing a movie based on something as iconic as MK but unfortunately this was just OK.

Story is basic but done right, and it prepares and introduces the MK world and lore very well. You will see characters teased in coming sequels, along with realms and different races. They balance story and fights very well, there is a good formula going. There are some silly and stupid moments like cheesy dialogues and delivery of them, but there are many amazing and super cool moments to compensate, like good timed comedic moments, character chemistry, tons of easter eggs, and of course the fights!Do not be worried about Cole, he is a good character and you'll end up liking him. We see the MK world through him which is a good writing move. Best characters are Kano, Sonya, Kung Lao, and Kabal. Raiden, and Mileena could've been better. Lui Kang, Shang Tsung, and Jax aren't bad. Obviously Scorpion and Subzero were perfected and stole the entire movie! In terms of CGI, the environmental could be better, but the character's CGI (Powers and effects) are perfect and look great!

497,scott_dunning,Good action flick but slightly confusing and messy,5,29 April 2021,"As a teenager I used to love playing Mortal Combat and Street Fighter at the local arcade. The games were pretty basic compared to today but a whole lot more involved then what I started with, Space Invaders, PAC Man and Joust....and let's not forget Frogger 😁
I remember when the first Mortal Combat movie was released and loved it, especially being a fan of Christopher Lambert who played Lord Raiden. The story line was good, acting ok and the fight scenes were every teenage boys fantasy. The sequel was a bit blah but still enjoyable....and at least better then Street Fighter the movie or the deplorable Double Dragon.This latest Mortal Combat offering centred around a brand new character in Cole Younge who apparently is the last direct descendant of Scorpion (Hanzo Hasashi). Cole's backstory of a washed up MMA fighter is weak and hardly explained. His relationship with his family is unclear (is he the biological father or step father), at least to me. Cole's power is weak and poorly fleshed out. He develops some form of armour over his torso and arms which seems to absorb blows and redirect as energy (think Black Panther) although I could be wrong, it was a bit confusing. The movie felt like it chopped and changed between PG13 to R18+ at will. There was lots of super violent fights with heads being crushed and knives being driven into skulls and copious amounts of profanity all of which made the humour feel out of place yet at the same time the choreography for the fight scenes seemed low budget and the characters saying ""flawless victory"" or ""fatality"" after their fights came across as silly. I know these catch phrases were a big part of the games but they were always said by the voice over fight announcer not by the characters themselves.There's heaps more wrong with this movie but I want to at least focus on one positive. I thought Hiroyuki Sanada was fantastic as Hanzo Hasashi. A real standout for me. His performance was totally believable (minus the last few minutes which felt rushed overall). The main backstory of the movie was the feud between Hanzo's Scorpion and Bi-Han's Subzero which ended a thousand years ago (or thousands of years ago) with Bi-Han killing Hanzo's wife and child and then Hanzo himself. Hanzo was Japanese and Bi-Han Chinese which apparently meant something in the movie but it's never discussed and we have no idea why the feud existed in the first place. Hanzo goes to hell and for whatever reason Bi-Han goes to work for Shang Tsung in Outworld as an assassin where he is helping to win Mortal Combat thus bringing an end to Earth??? Ummm why?So many problems with this movie but still an enjoyable watch if you don't take your movies too seriously (which apparently I do 😆).Cheers.",Mortal Kombat

There's some funny moments when one character declares his own fight a flawless victory.Overall enjoyable for anyone with MK nostalgia. They really play into the damsel in distress trope with both the main character's wife and Sonya having no real agency and needing men to rescue her.I really hope they make a sequel, but not if it focuses solely on Johnny Cage, which seems to be where they're heading.",Mortal Kombat

505,gpcheng87,Missed opportunity; relies on fights & CGI.,4,2 May 2021,"As a MK fan, really wanted to like this. Yes, it was faithful to the games, but that's the ""video game movie curse"" - ignoring story, pacing, purpose, emotion, character origins/arcs... etc., just to tick off superficial boxes.This should have been planned as a series - instead of the main character meeting a series of people who deliver lengthy explanations of what's going on, which the main character believes, leading to a series of fights. Actions also don't make sense: Sub-Zero is the worst assassin, mistakenly thinking he killed Scorpion AND Jax, the former who stupidily tried to take him on single-handedly when he could have just driven away. Cole also conveniently leaves his family behind with no protection (so writers didn't have the burden of doing something with the characters until they're needed to up the ante later on). The story would have been much more effective if Cole discovered MK lore on his own - i.e. Spotting the mark on Jax or narrowly escaping an assassination attempt...etc.). There was also no need to try and fit so much in one film - I think the first 7 min is pretty highly regarded; they should have kept the storyline more focused on Sub-Zero and Scorpion (the surviving daughter, the bloodline...); there was no need to include so many characters and try to explain/show everything - spreading it all out over two or three films would have been much neater, enjoyable, and build up anticipation for popular characters.There's more to pick at, but long story short, this game probably satisfied most MK fans, but failed as an actual movie (for the masses).",Mortal Kombat

The story was full of plot holes and twists that didn't make sense at all. The opening was decent and promised a Mortal kombat movie we deserve. However after that first scene it went downhill real fast, the special effects were good but my gosh who ever wrote this script understands less of the video game than 1996 mortal kombat 2 movie. Lot of miscasting and MK characters don't have to be softies, lord Raiden was a total whimp and so goes for a number of other characters. The only fatality here is the director who has no idea what he was doing. If you want to see some good mortal kombat watch the web version that ign made a few years ago, that has more depth to the characters then anything that is thrown at you in this 2 hour drama of a movie!",Mortal Kombat

513,kensai-5,Mortal Kringe,2,22 June 2021,"At this point I'm not sure what I find more embarrassing, the movie or the fact that there's thousands of people who claim to have liked it.I have mostly come to terms with the fact of life that different people like different things. Most things are subjective. There's no good reason to fight over opinions. Yet, all throughout my life there have continually been occasions where a majority of humankind agreed on making fun of certain subjects, due to their very obvious lacking qualities. I'd say Tommy Wiseau and his movie ""The Room"" make a good example. ""Birdemic"" is another. All of Neil Breen's products fit in that category.Mortal Kombat is only a small step above that league. The actors are all capable, when in actual movies. There's reasonable special effects and some of the choreography is above competent. But the writing, all of the dialog, the plot, the direction and all-non-combat interactions between the characters...are as painful or cringe-inducing to sit through as the movies mentioned above. Yes...I'd put the writers of the script (that was used for filming) and the director on the same competence level as Tommy Wiseau. And that's no exaggeration.Accordingly, my reaction to people who unironically like ""Mortal Kombat"" is about the same as to people who'd defend ""Birdemic"" for its ""great special effects"". I'm pondering their sanity.",Mortal Kombat
514,joseph-boik,"Action, decent story, and yes, fanfare!",8,26 April 2021,"First off, you cannot compare this to 1995's Mortal Kombat. That movie is a cheesy, great classic, and getting that again would be redoing something already done.You can absolutely watch this if you aren't well-versed in MK. It's at its core, and action film. Specifically, a gory action film. Yes, some of the dialogue is silly, but it doesn't take away from the film. Kano is the Mortal Kombat version of Deadpool, but it works, if not only overdoing the comedy a few times. It doesn't stick to comedy through the whole film, as each character has their own personalities, and that I feel is done well. Their powers are given explanation, and placed into the plot of the film, to give credence to magics in an otherwise realistic film. There is a level of predictably as well, but this film I feel wasn't trying to do anything too crazy outside of trying to make a cool MK movie; in that, I felt it did well. The fatalities are the huge fanfare piece that are also the goriest, and biggest, visually. They are where the budget of this film focuses heavily on, as does always its game counterpart; this was done very well.Overall, it's good fun film for action enthusiasts, and MK fans. If there is a sequel, I'd love to see them crank the dial up with future characters, an expanding story, and more fatality fanfare.",Mortal Kombat

It has the gore, over-the-top dramatics and ridiculous story that Mortal Kombat deserves with plenty of Easter eggs and subtle hilarity.",Mortal Kombat
516,rainfollower-95-646324,Not bad but could be better,6,17 April 2021,"First of all and overall, this is quite an enjoyable thing to see. It's got the story, the actors, the acting and the deep respect towards the MK game lore. The chemistry between Kano and everyone else is so real! Kano is the best party guy all around. Shang Tsung is good too, and Hanzo's arc is just great! And I really like how they cast all the people who really look like their gaming prototypes! That's cool.But this MK is nowhere beyond 'enjoyable', I'm afraid. There're reasons to that. First, the combat scenes, however surprising that might be! The camera is of a modern shaky kind, and the montage cuts the continuous action into a lot of tiny pieces, and as a result, the fighting is not really spectacular. I've seen a fan-made movie with Baraka where fighting was way more spectacular than here. No idea how they could come to this! The MK should be all about fighting, but the best you get is that scene with Hanzo you've seen in a trailer. Another thing is overly simplistic plot. It's super straight, and obvious, and very steady. No real 'climax points' anywhere. No tension! Both inside the fights and outside of them. The third and the last flaw: too much product placement and too little cinema magic. They tried to fit in too many iconic things, and as a result, we mostly see iconic things where we should've seen the action, the chemistry, the story flow. Putting it all together... I see it so that the concept is just not whole enough. That's the problem. Unlike 1995 version, it's more about fan-service than about making a movie. I have to admit that I still like the 1995 version more even now.All in all, it's fun if you know what ""Mortal Kombat"" is. And if you don't, then it should feel somewhat boring, but still enjoyable, just like your average 'weekend action movie'.",Mortal Kombat
517,duzt-52804,Not as good as the trailer,6,27 April 2021,"I'm confused with the attempts at turning this video game into not only a single movie but a franchise series - it is literally based on a tournament where the characters die. There's at least six deaths in this one and everyone's now talking about a sequel where you can't bring those guys back. Reptile is in hell and the tournament hasn't even started yet. The video game allowed for spawn scenarios but this movie takes on some semblance of reality even if there's a supernatural element to it. And of course there's such a wide swath in the ability levels of the characters. Clearly Raiden and Shang Tsung are the god-level ones, with Sub-Zero on the next peg down arguably with Reptile, and somewhere down the line are the more simple supernatural beings like Goro and Mileena and Kabal/Flash, then some martial artists with special powers, and then for some reason they continue to pursue regular humans like Sonja and Jax and now Cole in some weird hero role that they realistically can't fulfill.So essentially you need to suspend all belief in order to watch some one-off battles that generally involve one lucky stroke to decide it. And in this movie many of the characters don't even know what their power is until the last second (and Sonja finds hers out in 2 seconds upon getting her symbol).That said, it was a little more than an okay movie. I agree with many of the other reviewers:
(1) Cole is kind of a waste and that was a pretty terrible acting job;
(2) Don't expect an actual tournament or really an extensive storyline, though I did think they fleshed it out more than was given credit for. Clearly Shang Tsung was trying to sabotage and win by killing everyone before the tournament;
(3) Just watch it for the fight scenes. But really you could just stop watching after the first 15 minutes after you see the throwback fight and know you've seen the best part.",Mortal Kombat

520,skitofit,I was really hoping it would be better,6,23 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat movies have always suffered from bad story telling. The games were pretty cut and paste as far as story, and that's because no one came for the story. Everyone just came to see the brutal gore, from the goriest fighting game of the nineties.... when the movies came out over a decade ago they focused on a poorly developed story as well, (following Johnny cage.) And now in 2021, the same thing happened. Half the movie is a ""what happened when, & who's going to get vengeance, and this is the lead role, were going to focus on him. Etc"" half the movie focused on a fast and loose plot that had a few holes.... the movie follows one lead, and left the rest of the characters to be poorly fleshed out... the gore was great, in the handful of fighting scenes you see in the last 30-40 minutes of the film. So that's cool... but if anyone from the movies writing, development, directing, and storyboarding department is reading this; please... for the love of god... if you make another one of these mortal kombat films... don't try to turn this gore fest into a story.

Special FX were jaw dropping, especially when Jax gets his arms frozen and ripped off. Script was pretty good, banter was somewhat entertaining... Now the ""Bad"" They introduced too many back stories, felt like the movie itself never started, even in the last scene they hint at Johnny Cage. LAME Johnny Cage was an original OG character leaving him out of this movie is DUMB imho. Should have stuck with the original cast, Raiden, Cage, Scorpion, sub zero, sonya, lao, lu kang, etc..THEN show us the wacky characters in the sequels! Too much too soon, too confusing. Stick to the meat and potatoes. The Tournament. Show us the KOMBAT like in the game, working up the ladder through the realms. Instead Goro, YES the multi armed BAD GUY which was pretty much the final boss in the video game which the movie is based off of, is killed by a no frills Joe Smoe at a gas station in about 3 minutes. Its very silly, They should have had us follow Johnny Cage instead of a no name hero, maybe we would have cared more. Or how about ANY other character that WE KNOW> OH and Goro looked terrible!! The 90s Mortal Kombat Goro was 10x better and was animatronic. Imagine a PC game running on windows Vista, thats how goro looked. I found out they are making 4 more movies. Now i see it IS drawn out. About 20 minutes too long, the final fight was scorpion vs sub zero... um we waited that long to see that?? Instead we get to see back stories that really dont matter. Good attempt, but they gotta stay true to the game next time, ask fans, dont just throw together some fighting garbage and CGI.

WB made a mistake mandating the Cole Young character and choosing a first time director/screen writer to do this film. Gareth Evans would have done a much better job with this film and he worked with Joe Taslim before on The Raid. I honestly couldn't tell the tone here.. they made this a hard R for the violence (even though it wasn't that violent considering other films out there) yet the storyline and delivery felt like a PG-13 popcorn flick...

The soundtrack is almost non-existent, and the famous one-liners from the games are used and delivered quite awfully. I heard how the creators of this film were inspired by The Lord of the Rings' world-building, but the places here are plain, and the character designs are just worse versions of the ones from the game. At times, the main character's armor suit looks like it's made from rubber and had those folds that just scream ""cheap!""

526,stani_cv,Not much improvement over annihilation except for the fx,5,25 April 2021,"To summarize the general agreement :The first10 minutes are the only thing worth watching. Cole Young was unnecessary and given powers he did not deserve. Acting from all the cast was average or below. Worst of them were raiden, kung Lao, Liu Kang which were supposed to be the main ones. Best ones were sub zero, kano, scorpion and that's about it. The movie suffers from the same thing as annihilation. It throws characters without explanation who die within 10 minutes. How can they kill main characters without giving them barely any background story. The gory kills work in the game but here they're so cheesy it's just laughable.Overall I'm a fan of the games and even the cutscenes in the last one make for a better story or acting than what's being told here. This is a B movie with good fx. Nothing more. Mk 1 is much better and that should tell you something . That one I can still watch because it was fun. This is a pretentious mess. Sure it tries to cater to fans but we need something more than mindless action. This movie is just an average flick that feels like a fan fiction of some sort. The costumes don't make things much more convenient, that's for sure. Saying one liners from the game didn't work in the previous movie. Doesn't work here either.",Mortal Kombat

After you watched the rest: ""WUT?!"" Yeah, it's the same as it was Cyberpunk 2077. They advertised the thing with the only well executed part.This movie lacks many thing to make it good or decent. My 7/10 score represent my love towards Mortal Kombat more than the quality of the movie itself. The plot is non-existent and the lead actor is one of the worsts I ever saw. I think Lewis Tan has some relation to Steven Seagal, cause he plays trough the whole movie with the same face. Tadanobu Asano is also a terribe choice as Raiden, simply because it's painful to watch his ""acting"".The movie is saved by two guy: Hiroyuki Sanada & Joe Taslim. Joe Taslim is so good as Sub-Zero that you actually want the Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa traitment toward him and reimagine Sub-Zero in the game as Joe Taslim. Seriously, he is the best part here.

531,thale05,"A Close Victory, Far From Flawless",6,30 April 2021,"This is going to be tricky review for me: I'm Mortal Kombat fan but I'm a movie fan first. That being said, I will be as honest as I can about this movie. I had reservations and hopes going into it; to put it bluntly, I left satisfied but mixed. My hope is for the producers/writers listen to the fan feedback because I do support an ongoing movie franchise for the future. I think it's safe to say this movie is a huge improvement over ""MK: Annihilation"", so it is not a disaster.A group of physically athletic beings who bear a dragon mark are the Chosen Ones chosen to participate in a tournament designed to conquer and defend worlds. Earthrealm (that's us) is the underdog in this fight while Outworld is the heavy favorite. Same premise as the 1995 film. But instead of a watered down PG-13 version of the game, the producers went to bring us the gory, gritty nature of the Mortal Kombat franchise into a story taking place before the actual tournament. Kind of a strange approach for a planned trilogy: the first being pre-tournament, the second being the tournament, and the third post-tournament. The warriors of Earthrealm are actually preparing for the tournament and the main conflict is Outworld is trying to sabotage them before anything official.For a series of fighting video games, the Mortal Kombat franchise has an interesting lore and a lot of memorable characters to work with. It borrows elements from the fantasy genre and martial arts film kind of like how Star Wars brought samurai movies, WWII, Flash Gordon, and other elements to the Sci-Fi genre. Whereas the first movie was more of an ""Enter the Dragon"" redux, this movie was ambitious enough to be both an origin movie and a team-up film like the Avengers or the Justice League. The results are sloppy with the beginning seven minutes being very solid detailing the origins of fan favorite Scorpion (played by Hiroyuki Sanada) who ends up being saved for the final act in favor of a bland main character Cole (played by Lewis Tan). While Scorpion is elevated from being a mindless goon of 1995 movie to being an actual character, he felt shoehorned it. I think it would have worked if the plot was Earthrealm warriors joining to resurrect him in preparation for Mortal Kombat.Scorpion's arch-nemesis Subzero (played by Joe Taslim) serves as the Darth Vader of the film to Shang Tsung (played by Chin Han) the Grand Moff Tarkin of Outworld assigned to terminate the Earthrealm warriors before the tournament. First time director Simon McQuoid did a good job establishing the cold-hearted ninja as a menacing presence, almost like a horror villain, but gave him some cartoony dialogue. The rest of the bad guys seemed to be thrown in the last half of the film giving me bad vibes from ""MK: Annihilation"" which crammed so many villains into its story that most of the characters only had one scene. While it did not get as bad in this reboot, it did reduce my favorite Mortal Kombat character Mileena (played by Sisi Stranger) into being a shallow goon. My girl got satisfactory screentime and action but they really do nothing with her character.As for the protagonists, I was kind of happy what they did making a few of them Chosen Ones and not continuing the tradition of making Liu Kang (played by Ludi Lin) the Gary Stu of the Mortal Kombat Universe. Sonya (played by Jessica McNamee) and Jax (played by Mechad Brooks) are given development more than the other characters and while I would have liked to see more depth, I ended up rooting for them. But the one who steals the show is Kano (played by Josh Lawson) who basically carries the entire movie on his shoulders and steals every scene he is. They set him up more as an anti-hero than a straight-up villain and serves up the comic relief which can sometimes feel a bit unwelcome in a couple parts but it definitely entertained me.The pacing of the movie felt weird for me because it seemed it was more focused on discovering the inner power (akana) of the protagonists rather than progressing through a series of fights which were pretty much crammed into the third act. Whereas the original movie took its time with one fight and then the next, it felt a bit rushed. Don't get me wrong, I think the fights were competent though I think it has choppy editing for a martial arts film. Oh and they don't hold back on the fatalities; they are gleefully bloody and brutal like the recent games and two of them got a big reaction from me in the theater. There's a really funny meta joke about jumping during a fight which I'm sure will delight the most hardcore of fighting game fans so prepare for that one.As a Mortal Kombat fan, I enjoyed myself watching the film series have another chance but as a film fan, I found it mediocre. Oh and a point off for that sequel bait of an ending shot. Come on, guys. We get there will be more.My rating: 6/10.",Mortal Kombat
532,letande,FACEPALMITY!!!,1,24 April 2021,"FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU...... I mean, OK, I never liked Mortal Kombat franchise. It's hard to argue with the fact that those games were, like, a cultural phenomenon back in the days and it's impossible to think of nineties without thinking about them. Like it's hard to imagine eighties without Ninja Turtles, for example. And yet... those were pretty bad games. Presentation was great, everybody enjoyed blood and gore and it was fun to just... you know, stick around those coin-op machines and watch people doing ""fatalities"". Kids love violence. And, despite what some stupid people say, the violence in video games actually helps to let the steam off. Like you know... it's always better to have kids ripping each other heads off in video games than fighting in real life. And with all of its violence, Mortal Kombat was perfect for that.Like I said, though those were pretty bad games. Fighting genre is all about balance and... let's just say that balance in Mortal Kombat was never a thing. Still isn't, up to this day. So, as a person who always preferred gameplay over the presentation, I was never a fan. To say the least. But even I enjoyed the original 1995 movie. Paul W. S. Anderson? The man got it all right. He got the idea of Mortal Kombat being pretty much a cheesy version of Enter the Dragon with ninjas (you know, everybody was a ninja back in the days, even Michael Dudikoff, and all kids wanted to be ninjas too, of course), he got the right cast, he got the right music (I actually remember having the soundtrack on tape and not only because of the main theme), he got the atmosphere and all in all, it was a pretty satisfying experience. As long as you didn't mind cheesy martial arts movies and spent some time in the arcades. Seriously, I actually don't mind re-watching Mr. Anderson's movie from time to time. And while watching it, I can almost hear my old friends laughing while playing Mortal Kombat II on SEGA Genesis and consuming tons of soda. It was a movie that captured the certain moment in popular culture and is still good for what it is. Then John R. Leonetti came and... yeah... We've all seen the Annihilation.Instead of trying to make a solid movie, the man decided to re-create video games on big screen. So, he just filmed some random fights, added some cheesy lines and that was it. Watching the Annihilation felt like... I dunno. You know how it feels when you watch some cheesy cosplay or fan-made movies on YouTube nowadays? That's exactly how it felt. I wasn't nearly as furious as some of my friends, of course, since, like I said, I never cared about the franchise enough to feel bad about it being butchered so badly, but still, it didn't feel good and I don't think I've ever seen the movie ever since. One time was more than enough for me. But guess what? Here it is. The Annihilation. All over again... Good grief...And no, I'm not kidding. And no, I'm not overreacting. I mean, I'm not a fan and clearly, I didn't expect anything from this movie. All I wanted is some decent entertainment. But even though Simon McQuoid had almost $100.000.000 to work with, he repeated every single mistake John R. Leonetti committed in the Annihilation. Every... bloody... mistake. So, even though the new movie looks quite fine (the effects are there, fight choreography is there and so on), it feels... absolutely... completely... TERRIBLE. The writing here is so bad that there's a huge risk of hurting yourself with all the facepalms (FACEPALMITY!!!!!!). Seriously, the writing here is so bad that at some points I almost decided to stop watching. It was literally unbearable. Remember that pussy joke from 2018 Predator? That's freakin' it (actually, this movie has its own pussy joke, so... enjoy?). The story is also way, WAY too random, nobody even try to properly explain characters, while the directing... Well, you've probably seen Kano shooting his laser in the trailer. Didn't feel good, right? Let's just say there'll be more of that. A lo-o-ot more... Hiroyuki Sanada did great, but the rest of the actors are clearly suffering without a proper directing.The worst thing about this movie, though, is the idea of re-creating the video games within a movie. Yeah... that exact idea that ruined the Annihilation. I mean... who thought that making people acting like video game characters in the movie, while using all of those video game terms and cheesy one-liners is a good idea? It's a bloody disaster! I don't know if Mr. McQuoid have seen Mr. Leonetti's movie before starting to work on this, but it looks like he didn't. Otherwise... why in the world did he do all that?! He literally took everything that was bad about the Annihilation... and covered it with money. Like... what... the heck is going on here?!!Watching the new movie is like watching a fan-made stuff from YouTube. That got AAA budget for whatever reason. Tons of fan service, people trying to show off their characters just because (the movie just pretends that you're supposed to already know and love those guys and go WOW!!! Just by hearing their names)... and not a single well-written line on the horizon. Also, no proper atmosphere. Well, aside from the opening part maybe. Because Scorpion's origin story didn't feel nearly as bad as the rest of the movie. Painfully generic? Sure. But but nearly as bad as the rest. But honestly, even though I didn't expect anything good here... I'm still trying to unsee this. A bloody Monster Hunter felt better than this. Heck, some Resident Evil movies were better than this. Never thought I'll ever see Annihilation again. And yet... here it is. A bunch of random scenes, covered with crappy writing, shallow characters and cheesy one-liners. If you're die-hard MK fan, you may check this movie out for fan service, but if you want a good movie? Don't even think about this one. Well, at least now we know what good ol' Jar Jar Binks was doing all this time. He was busy writing the screenplay for this movie...",Mortal Kombat
533,jvg37,"Marginal Even For A ""B"" Movie!",5,26 April 2021,"I thought this movie had potential but it failed to live up to it. The opening scene and the final confrontation was the only real high-points in the film. The copious amount of blood (albeit CGI) was off kilter for the comic book choreography of the fight scenes. I was hoping for a more gritty, straight forward approach to the action (like Raid: Redemption). Instead, we were treated to ""have a mark, become an X Man"" storyline with a cheaters never win moral. I also take issue with a couple of the casting choices; Lewis Tan was not believable as Cole and Sonia Blade was completely cast wrong! Not belittling their abilities, just pointing out that they were not the best fit for the characters. The character-arc was also a bit forced, if not plain cheesy. All in all, it wasn't a bad movie, just wasn't a good one.",Mortal Kombat

I was very lost at some poits and needed some context to get some jokes, references and themes.Clearly and as expected, all the very good reviews arre from actual fans and the very low are from people who had no idea what they were signing in toDo I think it is an awful movie?

The fighting is phenomenal and while CGI can be hit or miss it was very pleasing to watch overall. I'm hoping that if a sequel does happen they could give a little more time for character development but I understand that it's hard to introduce so many random characters without it being 3 hours long.

Except the duel between sub zero and hanzo(scorpion ), rest are forgettable. We don't feel anything while watching this , even the most hyped fight sequences are mediocre barring the aforementioned duel and the dialogues are not compelling enough nor acting to grab us, as they failed to strike the right chord .

539,afatedcircle,It was...okay.,7,26 April 2021,"I went into this with high hopes based on the trailers which mostly showed an epic fight between Scorpion and Sub Zero, man was I left a bit disappointed.First, let's discuss Goro. They put him in the film for all of 10 minutes and get him killed by the new guy....and can we all just admit his face was a near copy of Hulk's from endgame? Goro was a fan favorite, not sure what the point of killing him off was.Hiroyuki Sanada was perfect casting for Scorpion, but he's good in pretty much every movie he's ever seen in. The opening fight between he and Joe Taslim as Bi-Han was great, but that was pretty much the high point of the movie. Also, you have Scorpion only knowing and understanding Japanese but says ""come over here"" in English. I get that it's the most iconic line from the games but it didn't make a whole lot of sense with him only knowing Japanese.Joe Taslim was great as Bi-Han/Subzero. His presence throughout the movie was suspenseful and gave people a sense of dread.Josh Lawson as Kano was perfect casting and his snarky/sarcastic humor throughout made the movie enjoyable enough to not be a snoozefest. Hoping he's back for a sequel because they're going to need all the help they can get.Ultimately, everyone else was forgettable. Especially the Cole Young character. I feel as if there was no need for him to be there and having him included in the final fight between Subzero and Scorpion was a let down, like Scorpion couldn't defeat Subzero without him. It was actually something people seemed mad about in the theaters.Some of the outfit designs were nice but Shang Tsung looked like a drag queen and was completely laughable.From what I gather from the movie, it's an origin story to introduce a few characters and try to give us an idea of what's happening. It fails at this because it doesn't really go into detail on any characters other than Scorpion and Subzero, but also doesn't explain how Subzero, a human, can live for hundreds of years. Introduces some fan favorites but quickly kills them off, for instance Kabal, whom by the way would never have sided with Kano.If they want to continue this series, they'll have to release a sequel within the next year to keep people interested.",Mortal Kombat

543,BB02,"Another Movie, another Dissapointment",3,14 August 2021,"I like the classic 90s movie, but I never felt, like it was actually a fitting adaption in all it's fun but dated cheesiness. And especially since the franchise grew so much with the last 3 epic games, I always hoped for a new movie or at least another TV show to do it justice. This movie sadly doesn't manage to make use of all the potential of the games saga. Instead it's pretty much ""Legacy"" all over again.Just as in the ""Legacy"" Series you can feel a lot of love for the material by the people behind it, but that doesn't necessarily guarantees quality - or talent. The director may be a fan, but choosing a first time filmmaker to helm a project like this is simply ridiculous. Justice where Justice is do, he does a good enough job with the fighting scenes and the effects, but the movie immediately false flat in the dialogue scenes in between.The camera is often awkwardly placed, the look remains blend and uninteresting all throughout, the mostly good acting ensemble seems a little lost at times and while there a some nice performances (particularly Josh Lawson steeling the show as Kano) they clearly lack the unifying vision of a good director to make their characters really come alive. As a result the characters seem mostly stale and liveless, definitely not interesting enough to care about them. Especially Liu Kang is reduced to a slightly whiny weakling, while Raiden is simply a dick, both seem particularly down powered from the games.Just having some bloody deaths doesn't make up for a story you not only can't invest in, but that rarely makes any sense, inventing new concepts and characters instead of trusting in the strength of it's source material and in general denying the audience to see the actual tournament that's in the very title.Just like in ""Legacy"" they constantly scale down the fantasy elements to make it more ""realistic"" aka cheaper, but also a lot less original. But in my opinion, if you can't make Mortal Kombat properly, why do it at all? This often felt to me like the old ""Masters of the Universe"" movie, taking the action out of the imaginative surroundings of the games, replacing a fascinating fantasy universe with dull and mundane real world settings.Strangely, despite this being really a 50 Million Dollar production, it feels very much like a fan film or web series to me. There are some nice real world locations, but neither the director nor the camera man seemed to have known how to film them in an impressive or at least convincing way. The same is true for the costumes, which look great in stills from the film, but look simply unimpressive in the actual film. And clearly just having people in costumes walk around in real world locations doesn't make it look real.I don't hate this movie, but with a higher budget, a proper script deserving that name and an experienced director, this could have been so much better.",Mortal Kombat

546,jprice-38253,"Good, badass, does have its flaws though...",7,25 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat 2021 is definitely a MAJOR upgrade compared to the old cheesy ones from the 90s. Anybody that says those films are better than this, I just, I don't know what's wrong with you. You just can't. I didn't have high or low expectations for this at all, but it is exactly what I thought it would be.Story: It's easy, it delivers well, but it's just corny and too predictable of course. I mean stories in the Mortal Kombat universe really tend to be very simple and not unpredictable. Not saying the story is bad at all, but it's just too simple.Settings: All very cool! The Japanese forest setting with Hanzo's family is beautiful at the beginning. Raidens temple was cool and ancient looking. The Outworld was cool as well. Nothing to complain about with settings.Cinematography: Definitely top notch! Beautiful shots. Well framed.VFX/CGI: Seriously, hats off to these people! If it wasn't for them, the characters and the film itself definitely wouldn't have looked as cool. The blood and gore is so on point! Although there was one point at the beginning, where Hanzo's head gets slammed on a rock, but then he's not bleeding? Haha. That needed to be more realistic. But oh well. All in all, special effects are amazing!Acting: Everybody acted well! And this is when I get to my explanations on all the characters....Hanzo's Hasashi/Scorpion: Badass! The guy is literally like 60 years old playing as him! That's impressive! Hanzo's fight scene at the beginning is great! The symbolism and the birth of Scorpion really shows when we notice the garden tool attached to a rope and how he became Scorpion. I really do wish he had a lot more screening time. Instead we only see him from the beginning till the very end of the film when he fights Sub Zero with Cole Young. Nonetheless, Scorpion is Scorpion. And always will be.Sub Zero: The guy looks like a GOD in this film. He's pretty much the main villain of this film. He looks so cool, foreboding and scary. I did have two problems with him. When's he fighting Scorpion at the end, he's only using the same damn ice sword move over and over again. He's Sub Zero. He could've done so many other powerful things on Scorpion if he wanted to! And plus Sub Zero is just killed off too quickly and too easily. Like this is an unstoppable force. As a matter of fact, I don't think he should've gone down at all. He should've been pretty beat up and then just retreated away or something. I don't know. But there's no doubt he will be in the sequel. He HAS to come back!Cole Young: He's ok. Not bad. It was interesting when we find out he's part of Scorpions bloodline. I don't really have much else to say about him, but I guess I'm looking forward to seeing him in the sequel.Jax: My man! He's cool! We see him get his justice and his revenge of course by getting his badass cybernetic arms. His arms look dope. He had a great fight scene against one of the henchmen on the bridge, by smashing the guys head like a splattered watermelon haha. Awesome! Wish I could've seen him fight more. Hopefully in the sequel.Sonya Blade: Eh. I don't really care much for her personally. Good actress. I mean she did look cool with the purple powers she had on her arms. But the one shot one kill against Milena? C'mon now! Make it challenging for those women! HahaKano: Ok! Hands down the best character in this film! Despite his fighting being terrible, Josh doesn't just act as Kano, Josh IS KANO! Oh my gosh! He perfectly represents him, talks like him, has the same body language, walks like him, same personality, same sense of humor, which made my friends and I laugh our asses off the whole time haha. While everybody else just acts like the character, um, Josh is the only one actor that IS THE character. He executed Kano so so well. Big respect to him! Outstanding job!Raiden: He looks freaking cool and all, but I'm disappointed that he didn't get at least ONE fight scene! That's Raiden! Lord Raiden! Who's wrath is ferocious! Instead we watch him guard a temple the whole time. Not good.Kabel: Looks and acts just like the video game character. Does the speed, has the humor, he looked dope in this, but barely any screening time. Probably not even 15 minutes.Kung Lao: Max plays and fights as Kung Lao pretty well. Awesome fatality where he kills Nitira with his hat! That's exactly what I had been wanting and expecting to see from Kung Lao of course. He got killed off early I thought.Liu Kang: Is definitely cool in this! His fire moves and everything else is great.Nitira: Completely useless.Milena: She does look like a savage indeed. The part where she shows all her teeth is eerie.Shang Tsung: He looked cool and all, but barely fought anybody, except for just sucking Kung Laos soul out. Would have love to seen him fight more or be more powerful.Goro: They did Goro very well in this! Can't complain.My biggest problems with this film mainly is that the fight scenes could've been longer I think and after the halfway point of the film, after where Raiden has a meeting with the group up in the white mist, everything went completely rushed. It was so obvious to tell. You could tell the writers just got lazy or ran out of time or something.All in all, despite Mortal Kombat having a few of its flaws, it is such a fun movie!",Mortal Kombat

552,aliahmedashraf,Let me down but hoping for a better sequel,5,23 April 2021,"MK1 and MK2 were great in their own way considering both were made in the 90's. This 2021 version felt as a huge letdown with some basics. I've narrowed it down:1) The opening was great. I know the movie wasn't meant to completely replicate ""Scorpion's Revenge"" either2) Introducing a new character for the new generation is absolutely pointless. Anybody and everybody who has ever heard of Mortal Kombat knows what its about. Similarly, having Kung Lao and Liu Kang as ""brothers"" was a weird take which didn't need to be done3) The concept of ""You need to have a marking so you can unlock your superpower"" felt very transactional and unnecessary and used up a lot of screen time with the characters practicing and training.4) Shang Tsung has managed to win 9 MK's ""fairly"" as he put it. But for this 10th one he is hell bent on wanting to kill the Earthrealm fighters before the tournament even begins. Granted that it has to do with some ""prophecy"" but they never actually get to the beginning of the tournament, Infact, the tournament never actually takes place as it ends with our champions going on a worldwide search for more champions.5) No realm can attack eachother before the tournament begins (MK1 where Raiden explicitly mentions this to Shang Tsung when brings out Scorpion and Sub-Zero). Doing this is against the rules and the Elder Gods will object but no Elder Gods actually interfere throughout which just doesn't seem right story-telling-wise6) Seeing as Raiden himself is classed as an Elder God, he could easily have gone to the rest of the Elders and informed them of Shang Tsung's deception7) When Raiden takes the champions into the ""void"" where Shang Tsung couldn't follow them, my immediate thought was ""why couldn't they just train here and avoid ST and his attacks altogether?""8) Goro deserved better9) While I'm glad that Scorpion's iconic ""Get over here"" was fixed, it still doesn't make sense to have him speak Japanese through most of the movie and just ONE dialogue in English. Scorpion then proceeds to talk to Cole in Japanese as well. Are we just supposed to accept that Cole is able to understand this foreign language?10) Sub-Zero is speaking Chinese while Scorpion speaks Japanese. In the opening scene, Scorpion even says ""I may not understand your words"" which makes their ENTIRE dialogue of ending the Shirai Ryu and the Lin Kuei's supremacy pointless.11) They need to either replace Tadanobu Asano as Raiden or train him for proper dialogue delivery because much of his words, I could not understand12) Reptile wtf?Fingers crossed that we get a sequel.",Mortal Kombat
553,huey2088,Cliche and worse than video game,3,24 April 2021,"A movie based on a violent video game, what could go wrong? I had real hopes for this considering it has Hiroyuki Sanada as Scorpion in it. But his role is so limited, unfortunately the other less experienced actors had to make up for the the lack of substance in this movie.The characters are cliche especially Kano, Australian actor Josh Lawson piles on the swearing, makes himself the crude and stupid bloke from Down Under. Then there is Lewis Tan's Cole Young who finally realises his true identity but he is so wooden throughout, it's hard to believe that he's the great one.The storyline is non existent. For a start, Sub Zero kills Scorpion's wife and son by deep freezing them in the opening scenes. He then presumably does the same to Young's wife and daughter, but they only seem dead and Cole reinvigorates them from their frozen state, somehow.The filming location is the one good thing good about this movie.

With the exception of Kano, all other characters seemed to have no noticeable personality beyond acting ""tough"". At no point I got interested or developed empathy for any of them. The chemistry between them is also nonexistent. The special effects are a big problem too. Goro's CGI is terrible. I'd even liked more the one in the original movie, because at least it seemed like a real thing that was in the room. This new Goro was a cartoon character. The thing they should have gotten right for sure at least is the fight scenes. After all, it's a film based on a fighting game. But the fights were quick, confusing, and involving characters you haven't established any kind of connection, so I found them boring to the point of feeling sleepy while watching them. The plot is very confusing too. At least the original was simple and clear. At several moments in this film I didn't know what was going o, why things were happening that way, or if the tournament had started for real or not. I got so bored that I started doing other things while leaving the film in the background. But what I missed the most in this MK movie is the FUN. Games are fun, and films based on games should be fun. This film seemed too slow, serious and pretentious considering it's supposed to be fantasy. I don't need 30 minutes of explanation telling me how certain character got into the tournament because I don't care. Just show me what he's like so I can identify and move into the action!",Mortal Kombat

It's an adult movie because of the brutality. My favorite character, named Scorpion, was played by Hiroyuki Sanada and I liked him the best. His well-known enemy named Sub-Zero, played by the high-flyer Joe Taslim, was also shown in an interesting way. Sonya Blade was played by the attractive Jessica McNamee and she showed that women also have it when it comes to such a movie.

575,JTReviewsPlus,One of the best video game movie adaptations,8,23 April 2021,"Do you have to be a long time fan of the Mortal Kombat franchise to enjoy and understand this movie? No. Will you like it more if you are a fan and have a better understanding of the lore? Absolutely. Mortal Kombat is a movie made by fans for fans yet is still a great movie in it's own right. The visuals are great, the characters are faithful to the source material and are just plain awesome (for the most part), the story is easy to follow, and the action is incredible. While a lot of the characters are faithful, some unfortunately get sidelined to allow the narrative to progress at a more even pace. Cole Young was a good addition to the MK universe but Raiden felt miscast as he was too short when standing by other characters, he didn't look tough or godlike (besides the lightning effect which looked great), had an extremely thick accent, and did not seem like the character people know and love from a screenwriting standpoint. I wish there were some more minor characters for everyone to kill brutally but there was a ton of action and violence from beginning to end despite that problem. If you aren't a fan of Mortal Kombat or action/adventure movies then this film isn't for you. However, if you look at the Mortal Kombat for what it is, then I think you will appreciate how good of a job the filmmakers and talented cast did bringing this world to life on the big screen. It is easy to see they truly cared about the what they were creating flaws and all. Hopefully everything can be further explored and developed in a sequel because there's so much potential here.",Mortal Kombat

582,jschroeck92,It should've been great... sadly it's not,7,26 April 2021,"Although I'm old enough to remember the arcade game and original games, I'm really only a more recent fan of the franchise. Mortal Kombat as a whole has always been famous for its intense bloody combat and fights, but that's sadly one of the main and only things that holds this film together. If that's what you're looking for in the movie, then this film is for you. Sadly for sure though, this movie isn't for everyone. The writing for the characters and story is simple and the same time lackluster. Some of the fan favorite characters don't really have that much character which really doesn't make them interesting enough to care about. The character that the movie focuses around the most is a newly developed character never seen in any games or movies of the past and he is just as uninteresting as a good chunk of the others. The one character that holds up for certain is Kano (portrayed by Josh Lawson). He did a great job being humorous and bringing fun enjoyment to every scene he was in. There are a few other characters I liked seeing and were pretty good. Overall, this is just an above average start to this new movie franchise and I hope that the sequel can do better assuming their budget is better as well. I still recommend this film though if you want some good bloody fun. It's just an overall entertaining film in the end.

If you need to have the movie be so accurate, you're better off playing the video games.And even the video games contradict themselves, most prominently since MK 10, where it seems they have gradually discredited MK: Deception, Sub Zero Mythologies, MK: Armageddon and some aspects of MK9.Although, the movie follows in the vein of MK9 and humanizes the plot by adding a new character, complete with some backstory and background.No new ground was broken with character development and it doesn't need to when we have played the 20 different games there are on the subject.The fatalities and gore FINALLY have made it onto the big screen and for that, I commend the filmmakers and their ear for fan service.The dialogue was less contrived than the first 2 movies and the witty Kano, who is usually despised by your average MK fan, was a delightful surprise.He really helped move the already awkward dialogue and deadpan performances along.For me, it was worth the ill advised trip to the theater.

I watched it a 2nd time and you know I think I'm just such a die hard fan I hated they changed some of the lore. However I get it they need to make it so anyone can go see it. Watching it again I actually found myself enjoying it. It's fun and the gore and all that is more of what I wanted. For a fan and just watching I do like it after seeing it again. I for sure will watch again.Well this movie is not afraid to show what it is. The movie is soooo campy. Some of of the campy stuff is clever and fun and some of it had me shaking my head laughing. The action and special effects in the movie are great. I will say I like the story in the first movie better as they kept more to the characters not having these logo super powers.I have played the games from MK1 to MK11 which I still play. So I know the story and how they can change but the thing they don't do is give people super powers that don't have them Sonya just wears wrist guards that allow her to shoot stuff. Jax doesn't grow his arms they are made. Also Kano he has a cybernetic eye. He doesn't have a power to shoot stuff out of his eye. Then like most of the other reviews having a new character ""Cole"" was not my favorite idea. I get the idea of we grow with him but you could have done that with Johnny Cage just like the Scorpions Revenge movie. The first part of the movie is dope!! It then starts to get campy. This is all fine I just am not a fan of the changes with the logo stuff and then the last epic fight get interrupted by Cole. All of us mortal kombat fans just wanted a Scorpion, Sub-Zero fight to the death. I do think they could have been more serious like the first part of the movie is but I see the direction they went but having no tournament was a bit wack to me. That is the whole point. Minus all the changes and add ins the movie is fun. I will say don't go in expecting a great movie. I am putting at a 9 because I love mortal kombat and I'm giving them credit as they knew it was campy and stuck to their guns. I do think there is more potential fo future movies if we can get any as I think you really could basically do the scorpions revenge movie but live action. Sure you keep the super powers as you already established that. I think a good idea is to make the next moves main person Johnny Cage. Sure keep Cole but please just use him as a secondary. You wanted to be campy but the same time add a new character as it would be better for story lol. So personally I think later installments if it gets any can be improved based on the feedback.If you want a good laugh and some good action and entertainment this is is a fun movie.

616,Kreatureofmagik,Split the difference,5,19 May 2021,"As video game aficionados I knew we would ""enjoy"" the movie but as film aficionados we were left wanting. It is entertaining- action packed with hand to hand combat. Recognizable characters that bring a feeling of nostalgia. Plot was all over the place. Knowing from pop culture or previous knowledge that there is a tournament/fight to save the world is obviously ""the plot."" With no real back story for characters besides Hanzo bloodline it was just... Meh. Felt like it kept ramping up and then splintering off to some other sub plot.We are inspired to watch the old movie and not to ever watch this one again. That is how much we were NOT entertained w this version. Wanting more. I started w 6 but down to 5 because it was in the end a disappointment.",Mortal Kombat

Violence was no where near as brutal as advertised. A GoT beheading has more punch than the entirety of what this has to offer.Hanzo was a good character, Katana was cool, and Subzero was alright. The rest of the cast was forgettable.MK could be a great series on a streaming service where characters get fleshed out and we get a build up to a tourney where the stakes actually matter.

It's all about the grass roots of the game and what made it popular to begin with. The violence, fatalities and characters with original movesets. This film nails these expectations on the bloody head. However, when it comes to the plot, there is not much they can work with tbh. It's hard to sway from the soap opera multiverse theme the franchise has buried itself in. I honestly believe they did the best they could and I can't wait for the next instalment. Also, shout out to Adelaide for hosting their Hilltops in the location department along with the majority of production staff located around Australia. Adds another level to the nose bleed section.

I must say that this movie has been nothing but embarrassment to the franchise.I wonder how the film makers managed to get the rights to the movie. They didn't get to have a good storyline; the casting is pathetic as no one suits the characters they portray. How they even got casted!?Fight scenes were also mostly lame as they looked as though they were entirely depended on CGI. All in all, i say we need a re boot. No sequel to it and not a single member from the cast, director, cinematographer etc. Should be retaken on board.",Mortal Kombat

626,sentient-74528,Just about okay,5,26 April 2021,"The MK creators keep making the same mistake, it's just tiresome. Kevin Tancharoen had the right idea to make a good MK film, but they insist in making it weird. This time, the plot is really weak and many of the actors don't live up to their characters. Their motivation is questionable most of the time, it doesn't make much sense.It's weird. Shang Tsung is hanging out in a mountain with nothing on it besides some chairs and a wall with the bad guys in Outworld, and he is freaking out about losing the tournment. Shang Tsung is so concerned that Outworld will lose he decides to kill all champions before the tournment. And that's the plot, basically. So the film is Shang Tsung crew randomly attacking Raiden's fighters. They are all a series of characters with varying levels of faithfulness to the games.The protagonist is someone no one knows and never appeared in any game. His power is to conjure an acquaman suit. Liu Kang is a tiny little fellow with squeaky voice, quite different from 1995's Robin Shou, and a most boring character. Raiden is... dull. Tancharoen's Raiden was much more interesting. This is just a round-faced guy talking with an accent, I don't quite buy it. Sub-Zero is basically the boss level character. He is unbeatable. Sonya, Jax and Kung Lao are very much what one would expect, very similar to the game, and the actors were good. Kano is only so-so, Shang Tsung is.. meh.. Ermac a weak dude, Milena is.. boring, Reptile is badly done, Goro shows up, and he is just okay.Kabal shows up (boring) and Scorpion as well. Scorpion's story was heavily inspired by MK Legacy and the connection is evident. The actor is okay. A bit old, I thought. I liked the previous one better, but very convincing.The fights are the highlight of the film, with faithful fatalities and it's fun to watch. I dislike all the armour and weapons worn by the characters. Otherwise, 1995 film is less clumsy. Tancharoen would certainly do a much better job. It was a huge mistake not giving him the opportunity. Huge mistake.There's a hook for a next episode. Let's hope they can salvage this mess.",Mortal Kombat
627,kcsariano,"If you play the video game, you'll love this.",10,24 April 2021,"WOWI LOVED this new Mortal Kombat. Finally we got a very good, well directed film that we all deserved! There's gore, incredible costumes, it's funny, it's fast paced.I could see someone giving this a lower score if they have never played the game, or not even know what it is. But from someone who played this growing up, and even now, it definitely gave me that feeling of nostalgia over and over again.I see people giving this 5-7's? Y'all crazy. Was the storyline that bad? I don't think so. They had to start with Hanzo because he is an essential character, and everyone knows Scorpion. They had to really dig deep into what MK is, especially for those who are clueless. So it makes sense the direction they did. And this is the first installment, so once the second one comes out we will get that deep, more in-depth storyline we all know. We'll see those other characters (personally I wanted to see Jade and Kitana) but again, their storyline is so complex that it wouldn't make sense to fit it in this first one.Again - if you played the game and are a fan, this movie is for you.**plus James Wan produced this.

The film is overall fun to watch.Certainly it is not meant to be a ""grade A"" standard, therefor a 10 seems to be unrealistic.The reason that I did not rate this film to a 7 is the following. The storyline evolves too quickly. There was too many wanted to be told in the time given. And it is not even a short film. This also results in parts of script that needed to come out epic, but sound like they are just told along the way, this is the biggest irritation. Further more the fighting shots are well displayed, however it isn't renewing at all.The actors were doing a great job, especially Joe Taslim as Sub-Zero. However Lewis Tan as main character Cole Young is not rememborable and Tadanobu Asano as Rayden was just awfully bad.The gore was very MK and the visual of the movie is the greatest score.

633,alvarax,Pretty good overall but the lack of a tournament annoyed me.,7,22 April 2021,"I enjoyed MK overall, it was funny, action packed and generally quite faithful as an adaptation. The acting was also really good, with Joe Taslim as Subzero being the highlight for me. I was very disappointed however with the lack of an actual tournament, the fights were either ambush's or quick come and go brawls, there was no structure or rules, which I expected for the first mortal Kombat movie.I also didn't gravitate towards the newcomer Cole, I felt like he was unnecessary, I understand wanting to do your own thing sometimes but this was not one of those times. He also beats an iconic MK character which rubbed me the wrong way, but hopefully we'll see them again. The opening is brilliant and the second act is solid, but it's final act is very rushed and leaves you with little time to take it all in. Pretty good but not what I was hoping for.",Mortal Kombat

By giving it the R rating they were able to use a lot of gore which is great because it's what mortal Kombat should be like. I remember watching the first two and thinking ""these would be way cooler if they were more like Kill Bill"". The violence automatically made the movie better than the originals. Either way I'm just glad to have another MK movie.",Mortal Kombat
635,safeatbase,Yes! Yes! YES! Bring on the sequels!,8,24 April 2021,"How is it that a Mortal Kombat movie loaded with special moves and fatalities took over 25 years to make? I'm still a fan to this day of the 1995 movie even though it hasn't aged well. Its blinding error that was universally offensive was the lack of fatalities and blood. Director Simon McQuoid, thankfully, is fearless. This is almost the MK movie fans have wanted. I say ""almost"" only for the reason that this movie takes place not during a tournament, but before the 10th tournament. Shang Tsung fears the prophecy of the bloodline of Scorpion winning the tournament for Earthrealm and spoiling all of Outworld's domination plans. But this is a smart move. It helps this film not feel like the others, and it allows the characters to fight in any given setting rather than ""Go here! Now fight!""One star loss for a weak script. Lots of cliche lines. Lots of weightless statements. Another star loss for choppy editing. The second act bounces back and forth in a way that lacks fluidity. This is a consistent problem with MK movies since fights are generally between two characters in different settings at different times, not two armies in one setting. I don't know how that can be resolved.The fighting choreography is great. As a viewer who has zero knowledge of different martial arts styles, they are very easily discernible here. Most notably is Kung Lao. Max Huang displays some truly beautiful Wing Chun. On top of that, his character is most accurately represented from the game right from his teleport arrival to his fatality, which is easily the most gruesome of the movie. Equally brutal and sad, is his surprising death. Max Huang's confident acting portrayed the best character of all the heroes. Please, please, please, McQuoid, bring him back!The show stealer is inarguably Josh Lawson as Kano. Without him, the movie would have been flat. Every line he delivers is a stitch. The dealing with his eye laser is a creative liberty that will probably disappoint every fan because it comes with the omission of Kano's signature face mask. I'm forgiving of it because what Kano lacks in costume he makes up for in character and comedy. And it's an MK movie, you have to suspend disbelief.Folks, this is a 2021 movie about demons and super humans splitting each other in half in outer-dimensional settings with a mere $50MM budget. $50MM! This movie sets up a much deserved and desperately needed sequel(s) and just imagine what it can be with a $100MM budget. Unimaginable in 1995, but cheap now. Other films with a $100MM budget include Little Fockers (2010), Catwoman (2004), and The Hangover 3 (2013). Think about that. With a better scriptwriter, editor, and doubled-budget, McQuoid can deliver a sequel that will be the best video game movie ever. Please WB and New Line Cinema, give the fans what they have been waiting for decades.",Mortal Kombat

639,eltechshops,Flawed but enjoyable,7,28 August 2021,"Starting right off , the movie opens with a beautiful , tense and well made fight between Scorpion and Sub Zero. The movie overall has pretty decent fight choreographies. In all honesty , better than recent Snake Eyes movie. If you are expecting blood and gore , this movie will satisfy almost every fan of Mortal Kombat games. The acting is not too bad but definitely not that good either. I would love to say how the movie is 8/10 but here are some problems that really downgrade this movie ( No Spoilers )
Audio is kind of weird in this movie. Certain fight music sounds way too epic for a fight that is actually happening on the screen.The Actor who plays Raiden is in my opinion really bad in this movie.I cannot understand why is Cole the main character. He is boring , uninspiring and you honestly don't really care if he lives or dies.There are also some questionable choices throughout this movie that may or may not bother you. Depends how much of a Mortal Kombat fan are you.Kano in this movie is just a perfect cast and carries this movie on his shoulders. I would not mind to watch right now a solo Kano movie if it existed.Certain location in this movie seem just pointless CGI. If you don't have money to show a certain location than just don't show it!However , this movie does have pretty cool blood , gore and other CGI effects. I am glad that they didn't spend their money on something else instead. This way , every fight seems just a bit more intense and fun.The fact that there is actually no real tournament ( Mortal Kombat ) here doesn't bother me too much because I have high hopes that with more budget they will actually make it good.I really do hope the main character of the next movie is Johnny Cage or someone else because Cole is just bland.My honest opinion is that this movie is nothing special , not really better than the original but definitely proved that you can , with a nice budget , have a good Mortal Kombat movie so overall this movie was enjoyable , I am glad I own it and I am 100% hooked for the next Mortal Kombat movie. I just pray that they have more budget and a better script for the next one.Don't believe horrible reviews , don't miss this movie !!6.7/10

640,teppo-2,"""OK"", but could've been more",6,26 April 2021,"It's not a BAD movie, especially for a ""video game movie"". But despite the director's self-professed MK fanboyism, it kinda manages to miss the mark.The basic story was never going to be Shakespeare, obviously. But for some reason they decided to alter things quite a bit for no real reason, and not really for the better. Firstly, there's no tournament. Not a catastrophe by default, but still a somewhat unfortunate choice. The whole thing does kinda seem unnecessary for Shang Tsung's plan.Then there's the matter of Cole, the main protagonist. Like a lot of reviewers, I find the character pointless. So many characters in the franchise, and they feel the need to make one up from thin air for no real reason. Why? It's kind of a slap in the face for fans. Doesn't help that the character really isn't particularly interesting at all.Also, it's clearly designed as a franchise starter. Which also isn't necessarily a catastrophe by default, but at times it just feels painfully obvious that that is what this is, instead of a movie standing simply on its own right. Now, I don't mind as far as the sequel(s) actually see the light of day, but with video game movies being what they generally are revenue-wise, I'm not holding my breath,Finally, and perhaps most importantly, given this is Mortal Kombat after all... the action. Well, it's R-rated, alright. But to me it seems strange that this really isn't much of a martial marts movie at all. The action is... I mean, it's not Star Trek (pre-Abrams) level of clunky or anything, but if this really was ""Earth's champions"" and even the Outlanders' best, man, that's some slim pickings. There's no ""virtuosity"" to be found. Hell, for all its flaws and campiness the 1995 movie had way better martial arts. For the most part this was like pulling a bunch of random thugs off the street and have them go at it. Things focused way too much on the ""arcanas"" of the characters rather than any real fighting skills.Mixed feelings, in the end. It has better production value and acting than the 1995 movie, but they could've done so much better. If this does get a sequel, I really hope they'll improve the action if nothing else. After all this is quite clearly designed a franchise starter, but with how ""successful"" video game movies generally tend to be and especially with COVID in the mix lowering revenues further I'm not holding my breath about that actually happening.",Mortal Kombat
641,cpnpaint,A preview for the next film,6,25 April 2021,"Cole, the main character and everything ""special""/""Chosen One"" about him is a waste of time... Instead of expanding on the other characters, they create one of their own uninteresting character. (keep in mind, I went into this movie knowing exactly what they were intending to do with Cole, and I went into this film with the lowest expectations and I was still disappointed.""
I like that They made the real sub-zero kill human Scorpion, cool that's how it should be.... I hate how Scorpion was barely used, I hate that Cole is descended from him, I hate that Cole kills goro and helped kill Sub-Zero....
Sub-Zero was done Fantastically in this film.I like what they did with Kano, Sonya Blade, Sub-Zero and Kabal: They wasted Goro, probably good because his CGI was atrocious. ! They Shouldn't even had Goro until the tournament. They had Cole kill Goro: The Champion who defeated the great Kung Lao, is defeated by someone who couldn't beat Kano or a MMA fighter? Eh'AhhhgkLui Kang was alright, but Im Taken Aback that they dont have him as a descendent of the Great Kung Lao as well. I loved what they did with Kung Lao, and they wasted him By having Shang Tsung take his soul.....
There was no tournament, a lot about the movie is filler for Coles character and finding tattoos, people unlocking their powers. Teasing you with a taste here and there.

Scorpion, Kano, Sonya, Jax, etc were great picks. There was no need to change a character who should've been Asian (she's a Kitana clone after all) to a black person.It was a strange decision to pick Reiko (MK4) and Nitara (MK5) instead of going with more well known villains like the Cyrax, Sektor, Smoke, and Baraka. It's like they were scratching the bottom of the barrel when they certainly didn't need to.That aside, I think they still managed to pay respect to the games, for the most part. Most of the moves and fatalities were taken straight out of the game. The fight scenes were awesome. Sure Cole was completely unnecessary, but he wasn't necessarily bad. Doesn't bother me that Johnny Cage was left out and thrown in as a cliffhanger for the sequel, but I would've preferred Kitana to be in. The final fight of Cole + Scorpion vs Sub-Zero was great. Probably not as awesome as a Liu Kang vs Shang Tsung would've been but good nonetheless.I'm a long time Mortal Kombat fan. It was a fun movie. 7.5/10.",Mortal Kombat

It was a brilliant choreography that set the expectations very high. Everything that followed was absolutely uninspired. The entire film was like a YouTube video named ""all fatalities"". It was stitched together in an totally random way. What's even worse is that something happened to the fighting choreography and it got decimated. It was as if I was watching a slow motion homemade video. Visual effects were top notch. Costume design was true to the game. And that's about it.",Mortal Kombat
646,codymurphy27,Too much too fast,5,24 April 2021,"I read an interview with Greg Russo lately in anticipation of the film where he said something along the lines of ""this isn't the Avengers, I dont have 15 movies to build all this up"". I didn't think much of it at the time, but this ended up being very telling. The gist I got is they went for Endgame but without all the prequel movies to build up to it.So much of this movie is glossed over or just magic wanded and its very disappointing. Lets establish some facts. The original 1995 film is, again from Russo, ""dripping with nacho cheese"", but its an enjoyable movie to all but the most pretentious old crooks. The action was great, the music was amazing, and characters were memorable, for better or worse. You get none of those qualities this time around. Little of anything to be enthusiastic about really. I feel kind of generous giving a 5/10 but I dont want my bitterness from high expectations to influence my rating too much.Again, I'll compare to the original movie. In that one, Shang Tsung is a great villain. Who could forget the initial scene with Liu's brother? In 2021, Tsung is one of the worst and least memorable villains in recent memory. The 1995 film was cheesy, but it knew it was cheesy. Every time Shang Tsung speaks in this movie, you get the cheese, but they aren't self aware.There were good elements and potential, but for it all to work the movie would have had to be about 8 hours or more. They were on the right track when they released the various shorts based on the franchise years ago, the ones featuring the same actor as Hanzo. There should have been an entire movie building up the story surrounding Sub Zero and Scorpion. One for Raiden & Liu Kang/Kung Lao. One for Shang Tsung and Mileena maybe. Instead, we get too many characters sprinkled into a movie without any of the backstory they deserve, even for franchise vets like me. I know who these people are, but some are cherry picked and rearranged to fill in gaps, but they often fail. They come and go faster than challenges when I used to play the games online.What I hoped for coming in was not just cheap fan service, but a finesse in story telling that this content deserves. It completely failed in that regard and I'm very disappointed.On a less important note, I feel like it almost had to be a problem with the cinema I went to, but the special effects were horrendous and the movement of some of the CGI characters and elements almost seemed to stutter. For shame.",Mortal Kombat

652,MovieWatcher2021,Nice Action Film,8,27 April 2021,"In recent days, when Hollywood can only think of getting in the good eyes of their overlord in the East, it is a breath of fresh air to see movies as they are supposed to be made - fun without any stupid addition to make the boss happy.The movie is fun to watch, the fighting sequences are really nice. It's a mix of martial art/kung fu and kick-boxing, basically, whatever works, and that's why the movies is more practical and realistic. The animated monsters are ok, look well done.Also, another good thing about the movie, when a head is crushed, it's literally crushed and not like Marvel movies, saving the feelings of the little ones and not a drop of blood anywhere. So, if you cannot take good amount of gore, better stick with Disney stuff rather than watching this :)",Mortal Kombat
653,fourhfour,I was a bit disappointed,6,26 April 2021,"I wanna start off by saying that I've played the Mortal Kombat games enough to recognize the fan service and the Easter eggs, as well as all the characters and some of the story. I've never been super into fighting games, but I do enjoy Mortal Kombat every now and then.As for the movie? It was disappointing. It felt... anti-climactic? Like the fight scenes were awesome, and so were the fatalities. But everything else was really mediocre. The acting and line delivery is kinda bad. The writing is awkward at times (Except Kano. They nailed his character).The main character, Cole, should've been cut from the movie. It should have just been all the characters from the games competing in the tournament. The movie overall feels rushed. Like, there's no build up or tension to the final battle. It's a 1 hour and 50 minute movie that feels like it should've been 3 hours long. Heck, I'd love to see a 3 hour cut of this movie.Overall, the movie feels really rushed. Watch for the fight scenes ONLY. If you're a fan of the games you'll like this one for sure. They did change the story a bit.",Mortal Kombat
654,fostersforums,Not bad if you don't take it too seriously,8,26 April 2021,"It's a movie based upon a video game from nearly 30 years ago, important to remember that while watching. I liked the characters, pacing, special effects - they even made the storyline work pretty well. All characters embodied their roles, and we get some humorous and nostalgic throwbacks, e.g. Famous soundbites from the video games.At the same time, I felt like I was watching a somewhat updated movie from the 1990s, but not sure why. This can work for or against your opinion of the movie. But all in all, it was enjoyable, not too cheesy and it even pokes fun at itself. The line where Cole questions the spelling of ""Mortal Kombat"" is pretty funny in and of itself. I wouldn't mind watching the sequel if they make one.So sit back, turn off the inner critic and enjoy this one. It's fun!",Mortal Kombat
655,itqqut,Mix bag of awesome and stupid,6,24 April 2021,"You know what this movie is. When it's good, it's GREAT. When it's bad, it's seriously STUPID.

657,Allvgretto,Not bad! CGI was really good!,8,25 April 2021,"I am not a big MK fan and I have just seen some fatalities on YouTube here and there however I was pretty entertained even not knowing MK that much.I found the movie quite enjoyable actually! I watched it with some friends and they also thought it was pretty entertaining. First half of the movie was carried by Kano to be honest because he was really funny or at least his dialogues were. I thought the CGI was greatt, It looked cool at least for meee and though it was a bit rushed, I thought it was fine.I however did feel like Cole Young was kinda.. annoying but whatever the action was great.If you are looking for a movie with a great plot, why are you even considering MK but if you are looking for something entertaining and action, this is just for you!Also I have seen one of the review giving a 1 star just to bring this movie down which is a bit upsetting but that concludes my review!",Mortal Kombat
658,Sowerplave,"Starts off excellent, but is ultimately saved by fight choreography and the special effects - 6/10",6,25 April 2021,"While the story was weak and the plot not particularly good, this is a visually gor(e)geous movie. A lot of the sceneries were cool and the effects were great. Some scenes were unfortunately too dark at times, to the point that I didn't even know what I was looking at.The intro set an awesome tone for the movie, but it didn't sustain that tone throughout the movie. Having Cole Young as an original character for the purpose of this movie allows the format to have a story that doesn't make having played the games and an awareness of the lore from the game a necessity at all - just like the Assassin's Creed movie. I did hear quite some outcry about the Assasin's Creed movie being an entity of its own from the games, but I don't mind any of that. It's two different medias for two different audiences, and given all the soft and hard reboots that Mortal Kombat have had, I don't mind any of that at all.The combat tournament is the core of Mortal Kombat. Yet, this gets completely thrown out of the window, because all of the fights and feud takes place outside of a tournament. This is explained by Outbworld having won the past nine tournaments, and the tenth tournament would allow them to take over Earthrealm. While I buy this explanation, I'm not sure if I am a fan of this take.The cheekiness of Kano and Kabal became a bit Deadpool-esque a times, but it added some good flavour to the blunt seriousness and stiffness of the other characters.Overall, I think this is a movie that ultimately was saved from the fight choreography and the special effects. I give this a weak 6 out of 10.Favourite kill: Jax's Fatality on Reiko.",Mortal Kombat
659,Rainman53929,Disappointing,6,5 May 2021,"With ""Into the Badlands"" & ""Warrior"" stars in this I expected far better fight choreography.

660,allenknott3,Not the Epic You are looking for!,7,23 April 2021,"This was not the epic I was looking for. The new main character, Cole Young overshadowed the existing characters, but he basically is Liu Kang. The plot is a all over the place. The fight scenes was good but some are quite short. Some of the characters look great, other not so much. A lot of blood and referring to the video games. Mileena's face is terrible until the last moment before they killed her! I have no idea what they was doing with General Reiko. Kano was the best character and they killed him. Sonya Blade, who is my favorite Mortal Kombat was alright. Reptile? Again no idea. No Johnny Cage.Despite all of this, I would like to see a Mortal Kombat 2. I think they could improve and make a really good movie.",Mortal Kombat
661,myny-jeffrey,Covid killed this movie,6,28 July 2021,"The movie would have been great even perfect, if the actors weren't more afraid of each other than their actual characters. During each battle you can't see more than 4, sometimes 5, people in the same shot and the fights were either too short, with too much space between and bad CGI or non existent.This movie should have been shot during easier periods for shooting the scenes and never been done this fast.

662,rostsit,Not a real MK,5,8 May 2021,"If it would be an independent movie with its own universe, I would definitely give it a higher score. But it tries to be a part of well established MK Universe. But it does so by completely disrespecting MK lore. For example:
1. Jax lost his arms to Ermac, not Bi Han.2. Everything suddenly becomes based on MAGIC, despite Sony, Kano, Jax etc. Abilities were always based on technology.3. Reiko is shown as a mindless brute despite in the lore he is actually smart and cunning.The list can go on and on.

675,detlic,"Great fight scenes, but the rest... (mild spoilers)",7,24 April 2021,"Uneven quality is its main flaw. Some stories and fights are well covered, but others are just lazy, especially concerning bad guys.The very beginning is great and the chilling performance of Joe Taslim is awesome. However, in the middle of the movie, it drops. That part is rather boring, uninovative and has terrible dialogues, pretty close to Annihilation.The new character being introduced is kind of lame and expected once you see the first scene. Some other characters are disappointment as well. For example, Reiko... He is portrayed almost like a person with special needs... Other characters (Nitara) are there a couple of minutes and are just killed. Scorpion has so little screen time...
Still overall an OK movie carried mainly by Joe and good fight scenes and deserves to be watched at least by fans. Obviously setting up the sequels which I hope will happen and make things even better.",Mortal Kombat

677,maxwelloreocookie,Feels like a long boring pilot episode. Video-game movie curse still not broken.,5,28 April 2021,"The main character is super boring and not even a real Mortal Kombat character, very dumb decision on the writers. Resident Evil movies already make this mistake!!! This movie should've starred Lu Kang, sure, obviously he already starred in the 90s Mortal Kombat movies, but so what? I rather have any Mortal Kombat character star in a in Mortal Kombat movie than some rando. And the Cole isn't even cool or entertaining to make up for it, he's super boring and bland.Sonya was passable, she was hot, but that doesn't save her mediocre acting, but to be fair, she wasn't given great material and lines to work with, no one was. Jax was just passable. I don't like the casting for Lu Kang, he just looks too much like a pretty boy, he reminds me of the main blonde kid from Cobra Kai, and I can't stand that kid.Kano was the main standout surprisingly. Having Kano as the comedic relief was actually a smart move, probably literally the only smart move the writers made. Kano does get kinda annoying sometimes, but still the best character in the movie, but only because everyone else is bad to mediocre.As for the fight scenes, they were just decent, not great. I was expecting way better fight scenes, but none were straight-up bad, but some have obvious overuse of CGI, but that's already expected of a modern movie. The fights from the 1995 Mortal Kombat move and even some Annilation are better.Also a big part of why the fight scenes are so forgettable in the new movie is because the music. My God the music in this movie is super bland, cliche, generic orchestral music, and it literally plays for every single fight scene! They seriously couldn't come up with any better and more memorable music for the fights? Or for entire just the entire movie in general? Like no joke, this movie probably has the most generic score soundtrack I've ever heard.The 1995 Mortal Kombat was cheesy, but at least those fight scenes and music was on point! Like you'd have a dope Metal track for Johnny Cage vs Scorpion, or the banging Techno track for Lu Lang vs Reptile! Cheesy but so epic, and I'm not just speaking from nostalgia. The new movie's music is bland forgettable trash, just like the movie itself. Like even playing a random Pop or Rock song during fights would've been better than the constant generic mediocre orchestral music, more specifically for the Sonya vs Kano fight maybe.Anyways, by the end, we never actually get to the tournament, which was a dumb decision on the writers. So it feels like a very long boring pilot episode with barely anyone pay-off in the end. Overall, mediocre and forgettable movie.This is nostalgia goggles aside, but 1995 Mortal Kombat is still a way more entertaining movie than this, obviously no masterpiece, but cheesy fun with an amazing cast, amazing fights, and amazing soundtrack. All of which the new movie lacks except Kano was good, and Sonya and Jax had potential, but bad script didn't help them.",Mortal Kombat

It is basically the exact same movie as the first one in the 90's. The CGI is better ....barely. IMO, the opening scene may be the best in the movie. Also, there are only 4 moments in the whole movie that gave me that cheap pop thrill from the games. The actors are blank because they're mostly stunt people. There's a rivalry between characters that makes no sense because it isnt explained. Raiden is just a really loud substitute teacher.

Storyline was predictable from the beginning and the writing itself isn't gonna win any awards, characters say their catchphrases from the games in key moments of the film, however, one big surprise for me was the character of Kano. He was the biggest and funniest comic relief character in the whole movie, constantly throwing jokes and insults at other characters. Probably one of the funniest, self aware movie characters I've seen in a long time.There are also weird editing jumps in the movie, one moment you're looking at characters interacting and in the next you're looking at something completely different. The movie suffers from a few of these, but given this is the directors first foray into the world of movie making, I'll take that L, most of the other important things were handled with care,If you know what you're getting and your expectations are right, this movie isn't gonna let you down with violence and gore, if you're expecting more then it's gonna be a letdown.",Mortal Kombat

They didn't even have a tournament! LONG stretches of people talking about finding their powers. BORING. And I'm down for a high brow serious reboot if it works. This did not work, they didn't even try to make it work. It was obviously written as a pg13 teen movie, and made the decision to make it R afterwards.

But then it became bland (even with the fatalities)The premise apparently was a feud between Scorpion and Sub-Zero, with Scorpion actually being the ""good guy"", which I actually liked for a change, but but then out of nowhere it becomes a mess.It turns out a completely unnecesary new lead character Cole Young (MK has what like 40+ characters I lost count), I understand you don't want Johnny Cage to lead, but its not like you don't have anyone else to choose from.The guy is like a great great great great great grandson of some other character and he is chosen for Mortal Kombat. From this point on, there's no storyI thought it might have been so much better if the movie was just about Sub-Zero and Scorpion, because the rest of the characters don't really add much to the movie. The roster is too short anyway, lots of missing characters.The fights vary in quality, some are pretty good, but others lack quality.Fatalities are nowher near MK11 gore level.

It was like I needed to rely on some prequel or something that I've never seen before if I was going to understand it. The plot was a bit dry and some of the lines were awkward and stilted, I'm assuming so that they could shoehorn in lines from the game. They would introduce a new character with super dramatic music and I did not understand why I should care.Overall, if you do not know anything about MK already, definitely just skip this movie.

This movie is like that. Just enjoy the flavors of several versions of the videogame and the 2+ hours pass like a breeze. Very good special effects, lots of references, simple but enjoyable and even funny plot ( people criticizing the plot looking for a Godfather like script are laughable. The movie name is Mortal Kombat, what you were expecting? Shakespeare dialogues? Get out of here!) As an action movie is quite intense and as videogame adaptation is what players were waiting for. Favorite Scorpion and Subzero get the deserved screen time and most of the other fighters are terrific and faithful to the spirit of the video-game. Hope this movie gets well on box office to fans get more of this. James Wan didn't disappoint and for sure a second movie with more budget could be a good thing for fans. And for the non initiated too. The movie is packed in action, very good fights, nice effects, good sound and as you can guess nice techno! Good for anyone, Best for fans.

714,daveelmorto,Fun!!!!!!,9,22 April 2021,"Okay so as I start a lot of reviews (for better or for worse) if you are walking into this expecting Shakespeare or anything resembling a critique of the human condition you are deluding yourself. If you are walking in expecting a balls to the wall adaptation of a video game primarily about a fighting tournament with all the promised gore and even some clever nods to fight conclusions from the game you, my friend are in luck because this movie is great fun and really does it's best o bring the world of the games to life.There are no surprises in the pacing, you are basically introduced to the main players as basically as possible, but this is fine because it's all just set up to incredible fight sequences and a decent little revenge plot
This earns it's R18+ rating(here in Australia it's akin to the NC-17 In the U. S.) to the film maker's credit the fatalities are graphic and unlike other films the bloodshed is gruesome and graphic
Here's hoping that the box office is set alight for this and this will pave the way for big budget game adaptations by high profile quality film makers... I'm looking at you BioShock

717,paddy-56,So much POTENTIAL... the bones are there...,7,23 April 2021,"A very mixed bag of tricks in this film. The REALLY great bits are the action choreography, production values and just enough campiness. What doesn't work? Really choppy editing, clunky script and a terrible score. Having 15 or so edits in a 5 second fight scene screams, ""amateur"". Soaring John Williams style scoring is so wrong for the action scenes and overwhelms the dialogue at significant moments. Every so often the tempo changes and there is better music, however, all over the spectrum. Script... terrible amounts of exposition and too many loose ends. No cohesiveness whatsoever. If you're going to introduce the world of MK, the opening sequence is great. After that, too much exposition and too many loose ends. Why mention, ""The Black Dragon"", ten or so times and not follow through with WHAT Black Dragon is? Too many predictable parts. Good parts of the script are some really funny one liners and utterance of famous Mortal Kombat lines in the appropriate places. Worst part of the script? Where's Johnny Cage and what the heck did they do to Kane? What's with the Cole Young character? Why mess with the compelling story of Johnny Cage and his introduction to Mortal Kombat? Fav moments, any scene with Hiroyuki Sanada, Max Huang, Joe Taslim, Chin Han and Ludi Lin. Great martial artists that BRING it in every scene. Not enough of Hiroyuki Sanada. He was tremendous, particularly any action scene. Max Huang moves like a panther and crackles with every scene. Joe Taslim brings great intensity to Sub Zero. Chin Han is a fabulous over the top villain and Ludi Lin brings great heart to every scene he's in. Lewis Tan can handle the action scenes very well, but as his performance in the Wu Assassins shows, he is capable of SO much more. Why not use this actor instead of having his character arc be so predictable and superfluous? Josh Lawson did a great job with his role, he was given most of the funny bits, however, his action scenes underwhelmed. Jessica McNamee and Mehcad Books were given terrible dialogue and significantly hamstrung action sequences. A real mixed bag. The fight choreography was excellent and it's really too bad it was hacked with poor editing. There are great tools in this box of tricks, don't hide them behind a weak script, dreadful editing and an inappropriate score.",Mortal Kombat

N i feel like this is doing some character building before the real tournament. Can't wait for the next following sequeals!! The director's done a great job on remaking this movie so far. But i feel some of the fight scenes could be less choreographed. Some of the scenes need to be more Bruce Lee or Ip man-like epicness. Being a mortal kombat gamer, i do understand they need to match the gory action from the game to the movie with different martial arts styles but need to make it more real.

MK2021 is the best movie of the year so far(Dune may beat that).With great casting, a good story, amazing fight scenes, stellar CGI and best of all, the respect given to MK fans that we deserve, Mortal Kombat was in no way a disappointment. I will admit, I was worried this movie would be stupid, but I enjoyed every minute of it.Not all of your favorite fighters are here, but the end does lean toward a sequel, complete with many more fighters, that i, and so many others cannot wait to see.There is plenty of blood, gore and violence, and even better, special moves and fatalities that MK fans have come to love.Its rare that I give a movie a 10 out of 10, but Mortal Kombat was definitely made by fans and for the fans.If you're a fan of the game, go see it.",Mortal Kombat
725,danieljackthomas,Kinda disappointed but I want more,8,23 April 2021,"The writing & editing really let this film down, it's pacing & tone were all over the place.Moments that I felt should have been epic were either turned comedic or straight up cheesy.The action was good but could have been better. I was hoping for it to be more like ""The Night Comes for Us"" yet this felt way more tame and, well, generic.There were several moments in the story where I felt like it took the worser direction from what it could have.Without spoiling it, they killed off one of my favourite characters (and arguably the one who was best portrayed) which really bugged me, i'm hoping they can return for sequels somehow as they're pretty big in the games.On the plus side however, I will say that the casting is great & the costumes/set designs are really good.Overall I wouldn't say it was bad but it was definitely underwhelming considering how hyped I've been since it was announced.PLEASE give us more tho! 🙂",Mortal Kombat
726,djtranny,Gory? No... But decent effort 6.5/10,7,25 April 2021,"After reading a number of reviews saying how ""gory"" and ""bloody"" this movie is and that fans will love the R rating. I was left wondering if I had watched the same movie! Don't get me wrong, this is a far superior and more violent Mortal Kombat movie than previous attempts and the fight choreography, script, acting and overall polish is quite good. However, I went into the movie expecting to be wowed by the gore just like when I played the original game and experienced my first fatality. Unfortunately, the fatalities and overall violence/gore doesn't even come close to that of the games and I feel this is as important an element to the movie as the fight choreography. I went through the movie eagerly anticipating a spine rip that never came. Thumbs up to Josh Lawson's performance as Kano, was the highlight for me. A decent effort and 6.5/10 overall for me. Would have been an 8/10 with higher levels of gore/violence (comparable to the games).",Mortal Kombat

I have no complains or negative comments about it, only my own opinion.The plot truly is a walk in the park, not emotionally engaging, played safely. If that's what the producers had in mind then they nailed it. To me, the plot felt like 2014 Fantastic Four.I'd say some characters weren't explored to their full potential, while others had more screen time and killed it. I wish we had a look at the realms but the third act never takes off, as if it almost doesn't exist.To me, the opening scene still the best thing in the movie, but unfortunately the emotion ends there.Maybe if I hadn't seen the trailers, some scenes would be a bit more shocking.Now with the good stuff; it is Mortal Kombat, and Mortal Kombat done right. It is funny, bloody, action packed, perfect to watch with friends. The characters are well played and everything works fine, in my opinion.",Mortal Kombat
737,mackcrocker,My thoughts,9,15 August 2021,Here are My thoughts on mortal kombat. I loved this movie yeah it has flaws but man I really enjoyed this movie. I loved all the little hints and nods to the lore and how it set up a sequel with Johnny cage who's my favorite character of the games. All the costumes looked amazing. The acting was awesome by everyone especially they guy who played Kano he was the standout of the movie. I wish there was more scorpion but his scene was amazing. The fights scenes were really well done and the gore was well done as well and they actually did the fatalities right and that made me happy as a fan of the games. I really hope they make a sequel because I'm ready for it! I give mortal kombat. 9/10.,Mortal Kombat
738,adams5881,I get it,7,23 April 2021,I get anyone who loves or hates this movie. The fight scenes make up for a lot. The movie is different enough from the source material to stand on it's own and I enjoyed the throwback Easter eggs. I got what I expected for the most part.,Mortal Kombat
739,steven_kearns,MEDIOCREEEEEEEE AF,5,24 April 2021,Honestly they should just give the guys who make the games the budget for a movie. This was just a mess which started so promisingly. The entire tournament boiled down to a mix and match of action scenes for about 20 minutes with a completely nonsensical story line. The worst thing is it would be fairly easy to make MK a great movie but they just refuse to acknowledge the source material to the fullest whilst omitting the best characters.Apparently they signed contracts to make another 4 of these but on this showing I can't see it happening. Such a shame as it really could be a fantastic movieverse.,Mortal Kombat

745,joseph_f_klatt,Why Cole Young? Just Why?,8,25 April 2021,"So the movie is overall pretty solid. Some things could have been done better. The story was kind of weird with Cole Young. I think they just developed him wrong. Probably would of been better without him.With that said, Mortal Kombat is known for their unique characters and their back stories. I remember playing Ultimate MK 3 when I was a kid and was hooked ever since! Loved the violent fights and finishing moves (fatalities). MK was built over decades with great characters and their histories. So why did they feel the need to add a brand new character into the movie they are making for fans!? Cole Young was just a dumb character and killed Goro! Yes, they had a brand new character that is kinda lame kill Prince Goro...Mortal Kombat 1995 was great! No new characters were added and they had the MK tournament which they didn't have in MK 2021. Also they had Cole Young be the spawn of the most beloved character in Mortal Kombat. Scorpion!!! Also, Scorpion had a little role in the movie. Like 5 minutes of screen time.I really hope they continue with the series of movies they have planned for. They need to kill Cole Young. Obviously they could not make it work and his power was dumb.Movies like Resident Evil with Alice worked but people still wanted the orginal characters.

751,seedoeatreview,A flawless victory in video game filmmaking!,9,22 April 2021,"It's not often that I'm beaming with pride before going in to see a movie, but that's exactly how I felt when I sat down to watch the South Australian-made Mortal Kombat movie. The feeling talking to other South Aussies was similar. This movie with a big budget, based on a world-renowned video game, had an absolutely amazing trailer that raised my expectations that it was going to be great. And after watching the fantastic SA-made film Escape from Pretoria starring Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), I knew that this state could provide the skills and filmmaking ability that would rival any country in the world. With a diverse cast and some great Australian talent in front of and behind the camera, it's fair to say that my expectations with Mortal Kombat weren't just met but exceeded!Starting off in ancient Japan we witness the demise of the mighty Shirai Ryu clan at the hands of the evil Bi-Han (Joe Taslim). The reasons for this are unexplained but we later find out that it has to do with a historical tournament between the Earthworld and the Outworld known as Mortal Kombat. Cut to the modern-day and we find that MMA fighter Cole Young (Lewis Tan) is somehow involved in this ages-old battle. Carrying a dragon scar since birth, it seems that he has unknowingly been chosen as one of Earth's defenders. But for a guy who can't even win a fight in an MMA cage, how can he have a hope against Outworld's mighty combatants, led by the nefarious Shang Tsung (Chin Han)? Enter Sonya Blade (Jesicca McNamee) and Jax (Mehcad Brooks): these two allies help Cole discover who he really is, and with the help of the spiritual Liu Kang (Ludi Lin) and Lord Raiden (Tadanobu Asano), he may just have a chance of keeping Earth from the evil Shang Tsung's hands.THE GOODFirst-time movie director Simon McQuoid has done a wonderful job of telling an interesting story, keeping old-school video gamers like myself happy without making the film feel corny whatsoever. If you've played the game before you'd probably know all the classic lines and scenes from it. Mortal Kombat provides a lot of fan service but in a way that makes sense, while keeping it entertaining, fun and very brutal. The story is kept relatively simple - classic good guys versus bad guys - the special effects are amazing and all the characters are given time to develop and shine.Surprisingly the stand-out performance comes from Josh Lawson (The Little Death, Anchorman 2), who plays the mercenary Kano. Maybe it's my Aussie bias coming through, but his character is hilarious and broke up what was a film that initially seemed to be taking itself a little too seriously. This actually worked in the movie's favour as there was no joking around in the first act so when the laughs hit in the second act, they hit hard. As for the violence, well, you can't make a film like Mortal Kombat without it. That's what made the game popular and that's what people want to see. The great thing though is that McQuoid doesn't just do it for the sake of shock value but in a way that makes complete sense within the story being told.THE BADFrom such a strong start to the story, it does lose its way a little at the end. It's hard to discuss without giving spoilers, but the audience is given a lot of information about this big event that never materialises (maybe they're saving it for a possible sequel?). What also irked me slightly was that the bad guys in the film seemed to be breaking the holy rules of battle whenever they felt like it while the good guys stuck to the motto that the rules of battle must be followed. Now I know that's just good storytelling but as an audience member, I was invested in it so much that it was incredibly frustrating.THE UGLYWith an estimated budget of $50 million dollars to make this movie, I have a certain amount of paranoia that comes from Mortal Kombat's no-doubt success. Because as we know with sequels, there's usually a bigger budget, and that means that film companies probably don't need smaller filmmaking locations like South Australia to make their big-screen popcorn movies. Hopefully, with Mortal Kombat's release, production companies see the South Aussie quality and passion that goes into making films like this, which will lead to bigger and better things in the future.Mortal Kombat is a film where it seems that everyone was on the same page. Director Simon McQuoid mentioned that the mantra of making the Mortal Kombat film was to 'respect it and elevate it' and that's exactly what everyone (in front and behind the camera) has done. From its youngest actor (SA's own Matilda Kimber in her feature film debut) to its oldest (Hiroyuki Sanada in his 111th film), the performances are outstanding, and although it may have a couple of minor storytelling issues, it definitely doesn't take away from the movie as a whole.",Mortal Kombat

It was a good attempt and I'm giving it a good mark just because of the legacy, and I want to see more and better Mortal Kombat movies (or tv shows for that matter). It has so much potential, but this seems half-baked and rushed. Movie seems like it started with one thing in mind, and ended with another. The Mortal Kombat tournament should be a grand event, with epic champions and gods and whatnot. And here it's basically a fight in the schoolyard, and that's it. Seems like the original two movies got that part much better.",Mortal Kombat

758,matris1,"Solid entry in the Mortal Kombat franchise. Decent fights, average story telling",7,23 April 2021,"The Good: The fight scenes. The film makers stated they wanted to create the greatest martial arts movie ever. Whilst the fights are good, they are a far cry from great. The fatalities are awesome though. They are gruesome without being over-the-top. A big thumbs up in that department. We expect a lot of fighting and that's what we get. Also, Kano is good for some laughs and unexpected self-awareness - his presence definitely elevates the film.The Bad: The screenwriting, acting and overall plot are average at best. The movie jumps around a bit while it tries to find its footing, but doesn't actually land anywhere. With a better plot and improved screenwriting - the movie would have gone up a notch.Should you watch it: Most likely you're interested in this movie because you've played the game when you were young (like me) or play it still. And on meeting our expectations this movie delivers, but nothing more. If you haven't played the games, it's still a decent flick with some fist pumping blood and guts (literally), recommended.",Mortal Kombat

Characters, dialogues and locations are the problem.",Mortal Kombat

761,johnptomai,FINISH THIS already!,5,25 April 2021,"The Original 1995 Mortal Kombat experience is the best and only Mortal Kombat experience. .Hiroyuki Sanada (Last Samurai) opening scene as backstory for Scorpion was amazing, and promising of a movie that never followed through. Lets compare this new movie to the original 1995 movie. The Original has an opening and an ending which are an emotional arc. Tsang Tsung kills Chan Kang at the temple (Angkor Wat -ancient Cambodian Temples) in a visceral scene. ""Your Soul is Mine!"". Tsang Tsung brutally murders Liu Kang's brother in order to lure the prophesied tournament Champion Liu Kang into the tournament. The original story actually makes sense, if you will. The opening of the original sets up the character of Liu Kang (Robin Shou) as protagonist (who is far superior to the protagonist in the 2021 movie) wakes up in a dream where his brother has been murdered by Tsang Tsung and returns home for vengeance in the tournament. The original movie has an emotional resolution. Liu Kang becomes the Champion of Mortal Kombat, vanquishes Tsang Tsung and releases his brothers soul in an emotiional and uplifting sweeping moment with music by. Orbital ""Halcyon""
Audiences cheered at the end of the 1995 film. Characters were directly out of the original saga's canon. Fighting was more brutal and visceral. Scorpion vs Johnny Cage fight was wild. The Martial artists were better, far better. The original 1980's Moral Kombat theme sound-bytes from the video games were still intact: ""TEST YOUR MIGHT!""... ""Finish Him!"" -followed by high adrenaline techno music... In comparison despite all that the modern 2021 version had going for it, - Hiroyuki Sanada and his scenes with Sub Zero.. all the modern CGI technology, the movie used up because the emotion behind the story and its characters were lacking. I found the 2021 movie to be moderately entertaining but ultimately unmemorable. After 25+ years I can still enjoy the original and get excited when I hear ""Finish Him!"" -Not so with the latest.",Mortal Kombat
762,switchboard85,1 part: A Frustrating Mess. 2 parts: Exactly What I Was Hoping For!,7,25 April 2021,"So, first things first. If you're not already a fan of the Mortal Kombat franchise and have no familiarity with the central story or it's lore, this is not the best place to start. This is a movie clearly intended for fans of the franchise and it's nearly 30 years of lore which is often referenced or alluded to without explanation. A huge section of this movie is already highly expositional and fan-service is kind of the order of the day here. Having said that, if you know MK even a little bit or have simply seen the original 1995 film, there's a lot to love here. I had a fantastic time watching this movie overall. There are some jarring edits, some wonky storytelling and a few bad hires when it comes to acting, but when this movie hits certain beats and does what it does right, it's executed so well and exceedingly satisfying for the longtime MK fan!(Minor story-structure related SPOILERS to follow!!!!!!)The Sub-Zero/Scopion parts of the movie finally do some justice to the classic lore and even though it really only bookends the movie's narrative instead of being the central focus or running side-by-side the larger Earth vs. Outworld A-plot. What is done here is more than satisfying in that regard though. The opening moments are treated with a sense of genuine earnestness and the final fight feels epic and brings the story back around to complete the emotional backbone of the entire movie. What we see in the interim is kind of a mixed bag though.Lewis Tan, who plays the lead role of Cole Young just isn't a good actor and it's easy to see he was hired for his martial arts background and his pretty-boy good looks than his thespian abilities. Thankfully, most of his scenes are bolstered by some really inspired character portrayals like Kano, Sonya and Liu Kang. Josh Lawson's Kano is done brilliantly and it turns out the one actor who least resembled his MK character's in-game counterpart actually felt the most authentic out of the whole cast. Kano serves as a very welcome and clever comic relief and Lawson is clearly having a lot of fun and plays really well off of Jessica McNamee's Sonya Blade.The extra-sugary icing on this cake (pun intended) are the myriad of references and easter eggs in this movie for fans to catch without any of them really being vital to understand the central story. This movie totally owns the fan-service it leans on and it cerainly has a lot to draw from. Apart from the existence of Cole, you can easily tell that this story, characters and even props were designed with the fans of the game series in mind and it's that crowd this movie really aims to please.Throw in some kick-ass fights and wonderful fataliites into this mix and I think what comes out clearly has more working for it than against it. If you like MK, this is definitely worth your time.",Mortal Kombat

What you get is a bunch of cool fights with some signature moves that fans of the game series will really enjoy.Overall it's pretty good, I enjoyed it, pretty much what I expected after playing some of the games.

Gone were the cheesiness and this one ramped up the gore and violence.It was pleasant to see that the makers of the movie didn't white wash it and the cast was predominantly Asian.If you are looking for a movie with plenty of action this one has got it in spades. Though not a gamer I have it under good authority that this movie is true to the game.I highly recommend it and can't wait for the sequel.",Mortal Kombat
772,Engerek01,Such a disappointment.,4,24 April 2021,"First, Let's start with the good: Joe Taslim as Sub-Zero and Josh Lawson as Kano both turn in amazing performances. Joe already proved himself as an excellent fighter-actor and Josh's performance as someone you hate but also kinda like was spot on.Everything else is a failure.The story is the worst story in the MK universe. Remember how the 1st Mortal Kombat (1995) movie's story was considered weak? It was a Tolstoy level compared to this one. I am generously shocked how can writers come up with this 1-dimensional story while the MK universe is so rich. Let me give you 1 example of how bad the writing is:Cole Young is an MMA Fighter. He literally earns his life by fighting in the pits. And what does he say when he is told that he was chosen to fight for the earth? ""I am not a fighter"". What??!?! This is not a spoiler btw, it is in the description.Aside from Joe and Josh, the performances of other actors are weak to say the least. This movie has the worst Raiden ever and this includes fan-made short stories. In a world where a group of teenagers can create better short stories of Raiden with their phone recording, it is difficult for me to believe that this is a Warner Bross movie. Seeing Sonya Blade in such a shape made me cry. The rest of the characters are, again, forgettable to say the least.Now, we know that Warner Bross lately discard stories and put all their money on CGI in their recent movies. But even CGI is terrible in this scene. When Prince Goro is first seen, he looks like as tall as a tall gate, making everyone else look tiny. But when he actually shows up, he is barely as tall as an average NBA player. So human size.We expected so much more from this. Would Snyder be up to do a Mortal Kombat Snyder Cut by any chance?",Mortal Kombat

Reptile was much improved from previous films, except he never fought in human form and that made the fight scene feel uneven. They must make a sequel. I compare this to The Watchmen, a great film that deserved a sequel, but never got one. Getting off topic, so I will stop and just recommend this film to all MK fans.

The recent games have taken on a delightfully violent hue and that was mirrored well in this film. Sure, the Scorpion/Sub Zero parts are scarce but that's expected; they are the best characters in this NetherRealm universe. This film is a lot of fun and the fatalities were super satisfying for a long time fan. Kano was hilarious. Sonya, Jax, Liu Kang, Raiden, Kung Lao etc. Were all great on screen adaptations. Even the new guy, Cole, who admittedly starts out pretty lame, is a beast by the end. Video game adaptations usually fall short by a large margin, and this one did not.Not everything was perfect. The dark undertones of the Hanzo story were solid although not perfectly executed.

The scorpion and Sub Zero storyl line is brilliant and a great centre stage for an MK movie.

Its nice to see scorpion in his human form played and choreographed masterfully.Then the movie fast forwards to contemporary times and is focused on scorpion's descendent named Cole.Towards the end of the movie as Cole gains his confidence...a suit begins to form on his upper torso...and I got so psyched, hoping that the full Scorpion suit would form around him; but that doesn't happen
...but then that's as far as the suit got...a really shiny muscle shirt. I kept waiting for the rest of the suit to form, and for him to become SCORPION incarnate...but it never happens.That's my only gripe, I just wish that Cole was shown becoming Scorpion ...maybe they are saving that for the sequel ??",Mortal Kombat

The fatalities here are few but they are absolutely gruesome and definitely needed to be!Look guys.. this is Mortal Kombat, it's not some incredible Oscar worthy movie, it's literally just a movie that wants to please you if you're a fan and make sure that you are wanting more when it's done. I did want more and I'm excited for the next movie and what could be a Flawless Victory if they fix some minor issues it has such as acting and the lack of screen time.

796,mad_mike1211,"Gore, One Liners, good action and good backstory. A tribute to Mortal Kombat fans",9,23 April 2021,"Best bits:
-The backstory and story telling of the characters was great- Sub Zero and Scorpion had some of the biggest focus in terms of this as you will have seen for the release of the first 7 minutes. The back story gives you enough to go off as a newcomer, but if you are a new comer that asks questions about specifics, you wouldn't get the answer (about the clans) but that doesn't take away anything really.-the gore was right-
Understandably, this was something that they never really got right in previous telling's of Mortal Kombat, so it was refreshing to see actual gore and violence that they inherited from the games. This was absolutely necessary to make the story telling feel real. You needed this to understand the seriousness of what was happening.-Sub Zero and Kano-
These two were by far the best casting and talent showcasing of the movie. The trailer doesn't give much away about Kano, so his part was a big surprise in the movie. He was witty, funny, pulled out some brilliant one liners including one about a low kick. Sub Zero really gets showcased in the movie as a villain, and his screen presence was brilliant. You felt that anyone who came across him was in danger, and rightly so.-Cole-
I am all for Cole. The trailer didn't really give him justice and many fans were wondering ""well, who the hell is this guy, and why should be care?"". But I felt his character brought a sense of grounding to the story. AS much as characters like Jax and Sonya are regular people, we still know them as video game characters being brought to life in a movie. I think the addition of Cole was smart to help make the story and what was happening around you feel like it could all be real.Bad? Bits:Okay so there weren't really BAD bits as such, just things that maybe id want different in some way.-Pacing-
The movie felt short and everything happened so quickly. It felt like they wanted to tell so much in a short space of time that it felt like it interrupted the pacing. In sequels, i'd like to see a longer movie, between 2 and 2.5 hours. That may seem crazy, but i feel like we really need that length to help pace the movie, control the dialogue and allow for more development between the characters etc.-fight scenes-
I loves the fight scenes, they were brilliantly choreographed and the cast did an awesome job. However, again i felt like many of these scenes were shorter than they should be. It might be that I've become accustomed to longer fight scenes because of films like The Raid and im a big fan of Jackie Chan's fights because they have a good length of time.-Casting?-
While I believe that 90% of the casting was perfect (it really was!) I'm not sure how I feel about Raiden. I may be overthinking it, but I didn't feel like he was presented in the best way. He felt annoying, arrogant and didn't have much to say. It might be that the writers didn't pay too much attention to his script for this movie but will for sequels, so I don't want to pass too much judgement on the casting for that reason.Conclusion:
This movie in my opinion is the best video game adaption and easily beats the first movie. The issues needing to be ironed out are the pacing and length of the movie. You can easily add 30-60 minutes to this movie filled with dialogue and you wouldn't be bored of it. It needed it as some characters felt disconnected from others in a way. The movie stays true to the law of MK, and the character design and casting felt near perfect. The action was great but could be longer also. The gore was perfect. The Comedy aspects were perfect.",Mortal Kombat

Everybody knows this isn't an A movie but the problem is, it's not even a B one. It's somewhere around F.I'm pretty sure 50$ million of the budget went to CGI because that's good, in fact that's the only good thing in the movie. Appart from Kano (Josh Lawson) the acting is terrible and the story is braindead. There isn't really a story just random fillers between fights.The executions are nice but they are totally out of place and the action scenes are bad and boring.It's sad, because it doesn't really take much money to write a half-decent story.

I mean seriously, Kano pfffft.Ideas ran out, fight scenes half arsed and a movie that suffered to a large amount of editing.Sad to say this wasn't a good film, but it's out there and it's did manage to be much better than the MK from 1995.",Mortal Kombat

As a fan of the Mortal Kombat franchise I was ultimately pretty let down with this movie, but if I'm being honest I didn't really expect much from this film adaptation of the popular video games. While there was a lot of things to dislike about this movie it was still one of the higher rated video game based movies, which isn't really saying much. Still, a very entertaining movie. Here are 7 things I liked and disliked about the film.Things I liked about the film:
1. Very entertaining film overall

805,dave_maguire,Not as bad as all the hate it's getting,7,10 May 2021,"Like most kids who played the arcade games I was looking forward this movie, and was gutted to have to wait nearly a month after its release to watch it in the UK, I finally managed to watch it this weekend, but had already seen the YouTube videos sneaking around and despite trying to avoid spoilers got the view that the movie was a bit of a letdown by most reviewers... Still I wanted to watch it so did and I have to say, overall I enjoyed it. Sub zero has always been my favourite character in the game so it was good to see that he was going to play a prominent role in the movie, and even if it isn't as big a part as a the trailers would have you believe, he is by far the coolest character (no pun intended) in the film and has the best scenes in the movie overall, partly due to the talents of Joe Taslim. The movie gets a lot of hate as it talks about the mortal kombat tournament, but doesn't have one in it, however it has become evident since it's release that this is a""prequel"" and that there is a trilogy planned for mortal kombat. I was interested in how this would work out in line with the games given some of the deaths in the film but it is clear that the writers have decided on their own lore so this may well not follow the games, which isn't THAT bad a thing. But as I say I enjoyed the film, the bulk of the characters are entertaining and well acted, Kano in particular is another highlight of the film and had me laughing out loud to a lot of his dialogue. The fight scenes as expected are all exceptional and the special effects are great too, and who doesn't love a good ""fatality""!However the film is not without its bad points and the main one revolves around the films protagonist, Cole Young, a pointless new edition to the mortal kombat lore. The film basically serves as his original story, which really could've been swapped for any one the main characters from the the games, such as Liu Kang who is woefully misused in the film as some sort of mentor tasked with finding earth realms greatest warriors....despite not finding ANY of them and only meeting the gang because Kano knows where the temple is?! Cole is also somehow inserted in to the scorpion/subzero story now as the last decendant of Hanzo Hasashi's bloodline, and Raiden informs him it has been foretold that someone in this bloodline will basically lead earth realm to victory in the tournament. However, the film doesn't expand on why Hanzo's bloodline is so important, and even when he appears at the end of the film, he gets his revenge, then just leaves?! I didn't really understand Cole's power either, it's supposed to be awakened by him protecting his family, but it seems to be more brought on by simple plot device, and he just seems to grow some sort of body armour that absorbs power, much like black panther, but only for one fight against Goro,and then this never happens in he next fight?? Oh, and gets some knives too??I do think the film sequel would be better off without him, especially as they tease Johnny Cage for it and, given how little Cole commands the screen, he could well just get lost in the background of the heroes - maybe he gets killed off at the start to show the villains power? I'm intrigued to where they go with the next movie and how many more characters will be introduced, I'm no massive fan and don't know much about the lore, I've heard of Reiko, but not Nitara but wasn't too fussed with them being in the film as they were basically there for fatality fodder, but was a little disappointed to see Goro killed, and Mileena also as it would've been interesting to see a meeting between her and kitana.All in all, it's an enjoyable film if your a fan, but if you're an Uber fan who's expecting to see a carbon copy of the first game you'll be disappointed, but let's be fair, a film just about the tournament might not have been that easy to pull off straight away with all the extended lore nowadays - as much as I love the 1995 film, the tournament made no sense! No main characters lost a fight, and Shang Tsung just kept changing the rules?! Also, there a simple reason I've not mentioned him in this movie, he's just not that interesting villain, and we can all agree that he'll never better Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's version!",Mortal Kombat
806,trav_haines,Meh,5,1 May 2021,"This is one of those movies you keep watching hoping it will improve until the credits role and 2 hrs of your life are over. If you enjoy fight scenes saturated with CGI, ok dialogue, and plot holes this film is will be right up your alley.",Mortal Kombat
807,plato-42119,"One of the best action movies of all time, if you are familiar with the game series",9,18 June 2021,"If you grew up on the Mortal Kombat franchise then this movie is a real treat. The writing and CGI are significantly above par in my opinion. The fighting scenes are good and occasionally give you chills. The violence is over the top, just like the game series. The movie throws in some comic relief (Kano) without becoming cheesy or breaking the suspense/intensity.This is probably the best video game adaption I've ever seen. I would put this close to the Star Wars franchise for action/adventure/fantasy. Again, super kudos for the over the top violence which might offend some but for lovers of the video game series are likely to fill you with child-like glee. I found a few sequences I was so enthralled by I rewound them and watched them again. ""Come over here!!!"" made me squeal with joy a little bit.A special shout out to the CGI team, this felt like 2021 levels of gorgeous graphics and special effects. The writing was... was better than I expected and muchhhh better than so many other video game adaptions.This is a much-watch if you 1) really enjoyed the video game series. 2) love action/fantasy movies with horrific realistic violenceDon't watch if you're not really into on-screen decapitations *grin*",Mortal Kombat
808,IliescuVictor,A fresh reboot for modern times,8,24 April 2021,"I will start by saying that I have very few knowledge about Mortal Kombat as a whole and I haven't played the games. I found the movie to be very entertaining for what it want's to be, meaning there will be fans who will either hate this or enjoy it and people outside of the fandom who seek a good action movie for a Saturday night.There's plenty of action, many gory scenes and good fighting coreography. A lot of popular characters from the MK games return in this version, with a few minor changes and new additions, mainly the protagonist: Cole Young.Kano is the show stealer whenever he enters a scene, but Scorpion and Sub-zero are probably the best parts of this movie. Their confrontations are a joy to watch, especially towards the end of the movie. The script follows mostly the same story line as the movie from 1995 and they do set up for potential sequels provided this movie performs good. I recommend you to give it a try, it's funny, action packed and filled with many lines from the games plus fatalities and lots of blood. Flawless victory.",Mortal Kombat

Crappy plot but makes up in the fighting department be it short for some of the interesting characters in the film. I laughed out loud over the Kano rant which gave it a point up but could've been alot better but then could've been alot worse.

815,chris_reed-69842,"Just a win, but no flawless victory",6,12 May 2021,"I was mainly looking forward to this for the visuals and let's be clear, they don't disappoint but a few things fell flat for me.What is MK without an actual tournament? I can see that they're thinking of a bigger picture and after reading up after seeing it, they plan a trilogy, but i was excited to see a tournament.I thought the film was too short at 95 minutes, it could have been 120 minutes and allowed for better character development. I mean, the story was literally spoon fed to the audience verbally from characters.Hanzo was my favourite character and the opening scene was amazing! Cole could have been left out. Liu Kang was overacted as hell. Shang Tsung lacked a presence - nothing scary about him at all really. Kung Lao and Kano stole the overall show for me - these were really well acted.Last but not least, I think it was a risk not including Johnny Cage just in case the sequel got scrapped but for me personally it was a decent film and enough to make me want to see a sequel. The passion and knowledge is there for it - just give us an actual tournament.",Mortal Kombat
816,BronnFlakes,"It's decent, but can't match the entertainment value of the 1995 movie.",6,2 June 2021,"I have a hard time writing any kind of review on this movie. It bounces around a lot and a lot of things happen for the sake of convenience, but the overall structure of the movie is okay.The acting is shockingly good for a video game movie, with the weakest links being Cole (bleh) and Sonya. Jax is also a little hammy at times, but that is all the script's doing. Kano is by faaaaaar the best part of this movie and he pretty much steals the show. The actor who played him felt like he was a level above everyone else as far as acting chops go, and his character's lines felt like they way more care and thought put into them than those of any other character in the movie.The worst part of the movie, aside from there being no actual ""tournament"" in the movie, is Cole. Before seeing the movie, I had wrongfully assumed that he was intended to be an audience surrogate. Instead, he is so much more. Not only is he a blood relative of a major character, he also gets his own powers about three quarters through the movie that are hilariously awful. All in all, I just didn't feel like Cole belonged with the likes of Liu Kang, Jax, Sonya, etc. The fact that he was able to take out one of Mortal Kombat's BIGGEST heavy hitting characters on his own was kind of lame, but it was what it was.Shang Tsung's enforcers were some awful picks. Outside of Kano, who wasn't even originally on Shang Tsung's side, we've got Goro, Kabal, Mileena, Nitara, Reiko, and Sub-Zero. Kabal's only purpose is to swear a lot and sway Kano to their side, and Mileena, Nitara, and Reiko are so horribly bland and uninteresting that you can honestly forget that they're in the movie. I actually forgot that Mileena was in the movie and had to go back and add her to the characters I named off. Sub-Zero more or less steals the show and about 75% of the ""villain screen time"" is devoted to him. That's an awful imbalance. This movie also did Goro dirty. Shame on you, writers.Oh yeah, Reptile was in there too. See? Forgettable.This all sounds pretty negative for a 6/10, but it IS a decent movie to put on if you don't have high expectations. It's just silly action, a little bit of hilariously over the top gore care of Kung Lao, and a few endearing characters (Kano, Kano, Kano, and Kano) who are fun to watch. The story is okay, nothing great and a few plot points from the games are totally glossed over here. The 1995 movie does just about everything better (except Kano), but you'll still have some fun watching this one if you're a Mortal Kombat fan. If you're not, then it's probably best to skip this one.",Mortal Kombat

819,Drogan-Hex,A Mistake,3,29 April 2021,"MMA fighter Cole Young seeks out Earth's greatest champions in order to stand against the enemies of Outworld in a high stakes battle for the universe.Directing: Who is Simon? If you can't afford a decent director then at least pick someone who has actually directed a movie before, or at least has some kind of connection to the story or a vision or something... The first act is great, when it started, I was really impressed and thought this will be a great remake. Then it all went downhill from there. I was excited to see the fight scenes, but it looks like the focus was more on the ""Fatality"" than it was on the actual fighting which felt bland, didn't feel like the characters were in any kind of danger.Production: The production team is solid, regardless of the fact they had one too many executives, but the team is solid. I expected more from Kasanoff (was also producer in the 95 original) to at least influence some reality into the movie. One major flaw is the excess CGI in scenes that required none and made it look too gamified than an actual movie. I am sure the gamer fans enjoyed it but when you make it into a movie the whole purpose of it is to turn a game into reality which is not the case here.Script: What kind of nonsense is this? Pick something and stick to it. Script is all over the place, and if you decide to combine a bunch of stories together then at least do a good job writing it. Bland, weak, and has no depth to it at all.Acting: Credit has to be given to Hiroyuki Sanada for an outstanding performance and for basically carrying the whole movie. Joe Taslim also did a solid job as Bi-Han (sub-zero), as for the rest of the crew... Their acting felt as if I was watching cut scenes from a video game, like they were just standing there with no emotion, reading a transcript off a prompter. Even in the fight scenes, you can clearly differentiate between the CGI transitions and the real fighting, and I am not talking about the unrealistic parts but some of the actual one on one combat is also CGI.Cinema and sound: Who decided that the best way to edit the fight scenes is by making as many cut transitions as possible? The excessive editing and cutting of the fight scenes is ridiculous. What bothers me more is that it's not needed, but I get why they did it, they needed to CGI the unrealistic parts, CGI half the fight scenes which I am guessing was to avoid using stunt doubles and to avoid showing how much of a mess the acting/fighting skills of the actors was.Conclusion: What a disappointment, Bad script, bad acting with few exceptions and a pile of editing and CGI mess to top it off. The only thing I liked in it was the opening scene, the rest is a disaster.I give Mortal Kombat a rating of 3/10.",Mortal Kombat

825,Nymphocat,Flat Beyond Belief,4,2 May 2021,"Throughout the whole movie, Sub Zero's mask was somehow perfectly misaligned, not quite fitted into his nose. It was a small detail, but I feel like that one perk encapsulates the ""director's vision"". If such a simple thing was overlooked, imagine what the rest of the movie looks like...I know asking for longer movies is seen as parody since Zack Snyder's Justice League (which now has "": Justice is Gray"" in the name for some reason), but out of all movies that have had fans semi-jokingly asking for them, this one desperately needed more time. It is as painfully Hollywood as it gets. Cramming up too much into its 1h:50 run time really hurt the results, specially since it tries to eat more than it can chew. It is a film that, ironically enough, could have beneffited more from having a tighter roster and less characters to work with, leaving bigger rosters and secondary character building for potential sequels. Regardless, not having Liu Kang as the protagonist (again) was a pretty lame mistake.I previously mocked the ""director's vision"" since I've seen some interviews he's made about this film. He purposely created the protagonist, Cole, to deny Johnny Cage the spotlight, arguing ""diversity reasons"", which right of the bat told me two things: 1. A stupid argument, given that Liu Kang exists, and 2. He takes his ""vision"" seriously, which is hysterical given the end results. Not only were Cole and Liu Kang miserable in portrayal and writing, but many pre-release materials where hyping the combat (sorry, kombat...) as a highlight of the show. Can't really review the latter, as the generic industry editing makes the coreography almost indigestable. And what a shame. Sub Zero and Scorpion were credited as the showstoppers, as the actor's skills were hyped as ""too fast and too much"", despite the characters having very little screen-time. The pretentious nature of the director's promotion was already a red herring. Shame there wasn't any verve to back it up.I didn't hate it, but it's irritating how Hollywood continuously misunderstands how to treat creative properties. I get that calling things ""cookie cutter"" is very cliche, but can I just say... the actual cookie cutter Hollywood has not only is dreadful, but it frequently fails and flops. I think it's time the industry chooses another template. One that is, at least, humanly bearable.",Mortal Kombat

1. It's an enjoyable punch-em-up with great one liners from Kano, a load of great fights, fantastic finishes and above average special effects. It doesn't stretch the ethos of Mortal Kombat all that much, but it is better than practically all of the media beforehand. Recommended2. For someone that's played the games, watched all of the films, as well as being a fan of martial arts, it's somewhat of a disappointment. Sure, those one liners and blood filled finishes are pretty damn good, but it's still missing so much. Where's Michael Jai White? Where's Scott Adkins? We have a few martial artists at the top of their game, but I do feel that this film is another missed opportunity. Sure, it's nowhere near as bad as MK: Annihilation, but raising the bar from really, really bad to actually reasonably okay, is doing just that. Raising the bar. I want the bar raised and smashed over Outworld's face.Furthermore, we've just had the excellent MK: Scorpion's revenge. Now THAT was good.

Someone smart enough to add some substance to this story.For example, finding your magical inner power could've been an amazing self discovery story for each character - an opportunity for the audience to get to know them and start to care about them; not a stoopid, superficial plot trick that gets resolved in seconds, while we watch trash talk for 1.5 hours.The promise of the plot is that the protagonists turn their flaws into super-powers. But no.Earth's mightiest fighters are weak and poorly trained, and the guy who's supposed to train them won't, because he's clever like that. So there's no good reason why these fighters are horribly bad the whole movie yet win their fights at the end.Also the bad guys are breaking the rules with no consequences bc the Universe has been organizing Mortal Kombats with strict rules 9 times in a row, for millennia, but now is like ""Nah, we're cool"".So Earth's defenders get clever and break the rules too and... they fight, and they say all the MK lines, but there is no MK; and they sorta win, but also no. And the bad guys are dead, but also not really, because ""death is just another portal"".Who wrote this?!?And oh, btw, we have a fake ""protagonist"" - Cole FingWho? He is a loser. He loses EVERY fight. His super-power is getting beaten up and giving up. His own kid can see it. He is here bc he's related to Scorpio. That's right: nepotism got him the lead in a MK film.So does he learn anything in order to find his magical gift? No, he doesn't, we do: that his wife is a LOT braver than him.I was hoping his kid is the actual hero - a surprise reveal, as the story starts with a baby GIRL being the only survivor of the bloodline of Scorpio. But nope. The storyline is a complete waste of time - don't get invested.All the characters are badly written, superficial puppets you don't really care about. I would've given it 2 stars for writing Sonya as a badass, but it got down to one star the moment I saw that smart kid from the beginning of the movie yell repeatedly, like an idiot: ""Dad? Dad? Dad!?"" .... while her dad was fighting a creepy being, with 4 arms and magical powers.Just don't.",Mortal Kombat
845,daemonxhun,"Absolutely abysmal, the '95 original seems like a masterpiece in comparison",3,23 April 2021,"I feel like I lost like a million of my brain cells. I cannot even comprehend how it was even possible to make something as bad as this. I feel sorry for the actors/martial artists who have signed on for such a terrible, truly terrible script.I don't even know where to start it's such a big trainwreck. Well, let's start with this one. It doesn't even feel like a MOVIE even though it claims to be one. Even when I occasionally see some bad movies, at least I can still say about them that they were actually structured, paced, cut, and directed like a movie.As for Mortal Kombat, well, not so much. It has a barely passable first act that ends with a 3-page long exposition dump from Sonya Blade about the mysticism and history of the Mortal Kombat tournament. Because of the context and line delivery, this feels so cringeworthy and unbeliavable that I was waiting for either her or Cole to burst out laughing. Right before that you see her, Kano and Cole fight against Reptile... wait, an actual reptile... WTF...Anyway, then the second act comes in which pretty much nothing happens just random characters get introduced in an extremely anticlimactic and lame way, then they occasionally fight and say things only Timmy Wiseau would wrote (maybe the screenwriter of MK is his relative).And... where's the third act? It's pretty much also non-existent. Just suddenly Shang Tsung comes in again for the 5th or god knows which time and the bad guys and good guys fight, we get a little fan-service and then THE END.Basically, here's the summary of the movie:There's no tournament. Characters do random stuff in roughly the first third of the movie. In the second third of the movie, they do random stuff and say really bad lines in a lame cave. In the last third, they do all the same things as in the previous two thirds, but this time in the city AND in the cave. WOW! Oh, and Shang Tsung and his buddies appear every 20 minutes or so because they are impatient and want to kill the champions of Eearthrealm.The fighting scenes are not that interesting or engaging, I've seen much better in tons of other movies. The soundtrack sucks (e.g. It's not fitting at all and so bad that right after Hanzo's family gets killed, a low quality rock song kicks in when Hanzo starts fighting against the attackers, instead of something more orchestral, adrenalin pumping and emotional that would help convey to the audience Hanzo's inner rage and feel of sadness).The scenes transition into each other in an extremely abrupt way, scenes get cut very randomly, there's no flow at all to the entire movie, a high-school fan-film is much better thought out than this.The original MK movie from 1995 compared to this seems like a masterpiece because it actually had a good flow, a perfect balance between seriosuness and self-reflective comedy (which helped a lot), memorable characters, interesting world design and fun fight scenes, with a badass soundtrack. Yeah, it was a cringey movie, yet it still did pretty much everything better than the 2021 film, aside from the cinematography and visuals (the original still had much more varied environments though).I would rate MK2021 a 3 out of 10. I do not recommend watching it at all.",Mortal Kombat

The scene where Liu Kang beats Kano with leg sweep was legendary. Build up to the Johnny Cage at the end was amazing.I didn't like the newly invented character Cole Young. Cole by himself is not bad character, but I thought that they were gonna make him young Scorpion who inherits Hanzo's powers or something like that. When I saw him get that armor I realized that it went in wrong direction and I was little bit disappointed.His visual design was really not good and also there is no need for new characters when in the lore there is plenty who can take the role. Actor was pretty good tho, he could have pulled an amazing young Scorpion.Also I didn't like that new thing how they get their powers - Arkana. They should have done it like in games.Other parts were just good so I can't rate the movie lower than 9.",Mortal Kombat
853,starwarspasta,Entertaining film that paid homage to the original,7,26 April 2021,"I didn't know what to expect with this iteration of Mortal Kombat, but it did not disappoint. Within the exception of Johnny Cage, all the main characters from the original are in this movie, just playing different roles or versions of themselves. Unlike the original in which the film is situationally driven (fight scene, brief dialogue, immediately another fight scene) the 2021 Mortal Kombat is character driven. This allows for a better balance in the film between fight scenes and exposition, making it ultimately more enjoyable. Unlike some of the other misleading reviews, there were many fatalities in the film, and the movie has a very high rewatch ability factor. The aspect I enjoyed the most was the strong effort by the makers of this film to include nearly all the elements from the original, while putting their own spin on interpreting them (I.e scorpion using a blade attached to rope rather then rope shooting out of his hand). While the original will always be a guilty pleasure, the higher budget of the 2021 version paired with the R rating and more effort into making a complex plot just makes it a better film.",Mortal Kombat
854,lordoflightrhollor,Positively Incredible.,10,24 April 2021,"Clearly I didn't watch the same film as the critics and the naysayers because this Mortal Kombat adaptation was the best so far for sure.The cast. The crew. Everyone should be commended on an outstanding job well done. The fight choreography and the stunts were incredible. I thought the plot was actually quite compelling. They could've gone further with Cole's background, but perhaps a prequel and a sequel are in the works and at that point, this installment will fit into this new MK universe like a puzzle piece.The action here was unparalleled. It reminded me of the era of Jet Li/Jackie Chan/Bruce Lee/Chow Yun Fat legends. Except now, we have fresh, young handsome legends in the making via Lewis Tan and Joe Taslim.My only true gripes here, and not important enough to dock points, is that the special effects and the CGI could've definitely been better and the story could've blossomed better as well.But overall, it was incredible and I will be rewatching!",Mortal Kombat
855,friendswithwindowsxp,okay...,5,29 April 2021,"When you think of mortal kombat you think of one thing... BLOOD. Over the top comically violent finishing moves. Well once again they did not deliver the creative ultra violence from the game franchise that makes it popular in the first place. The film was paced like a fever dream. The cgi was weak. Felt like a movie from 2003. Acting was bad. Script was poor it even included a forrest gump reference. I dont understand why this was made. Its not an upgrade to the 1994 film whatsoever. We still dont get spinal cords. We do get a scene where kano has the perfect oppertunity to bite into heart he pulls from a demons chest but just holds it up and quips.

For example I would prefer to see Johnny Cage, or Striker for the good guys rather than a new guy, but also I think is a good idea to have a new character in the future video games, so I can live with this one.Try to see it in theaters so they earn enough for the sequel, I think they did a good work with this one.",Mortal Kombat

The kid in me who played this in the 90's & thought the pixilated red squares of ""blood"" were top notch graphics was thrilled. They did a good job of mixing classic elements from the games while bringing their own spin to the franchise.The one thing I don't agree with most of the other reviewers on is the lack of the actual tournament. It would have been so rushed If they tried to cram in the tournament into this movie & there would have been zero chance for any character growth or backstories to be shown. This entry was seems like a great ""origin"" story for the characters, they set it up so the fighters who were finished are going to comeback in some way which will make the tournaments a lot more compelling. Now the characters have some history & beef between them so the rematch fights will be next level. Plus the bulk of the next movie can be the actual tournament since we got all the backstory stuff out of the way in this movie. During the rematches the ""fallen"" characters will be out for revenge in a big way, I personally really want to see Sonya (at full power) take on a newly revived Mileena - hopefully rocking a Goldie Hawn Death Becomes Her style hole in her torso.",Mortal Kombat

860,rockdude-68045,It's a cinematic take on a game,9,24 April 2021,"To summarize: this movie accomplishes what it intended to. It's a more graphic, modern, and cinematic take on the games content. It builds a loose plot line to allow for multiple fights while essentially serving as a prologue to future potential sequels or movies.Pros:
Graphic content, Delivers what you expect, Scorpion Vs Sub-Zero driving the plot line, easy to follow, multiple fights, and distinguishes itself from old movies.Cons:
Struggled to create a climatic fight sequence like old films where they progressed to a boss, cussing was ok but almost became unnecessary at times like it was being forced, acting took some time to adjust to, fights weren't very long (but did allow for more), and missed out on the epic fight music keying in at the right times.Final thoughts:
It's a movie converted from a game and should be treated as such. Not-so-serious entertainment that gives exactly whats expected of if with room to flourish with sequels and etc if properly managed. The story behind Cole young surprisingly didn't suck either and neither did the movie as long as you keep it in perspective of what exactly it is (a gaming fans movie).",Mortal Kombat

Costumes were great. Most of the characters was introduced without any build-up or back stories. Some of the fights were great.. Some weren't. Loved scorpion. He should have been the main lead.

Everything you expect to see and hear you do.I've watched twice so far (back to back days) just to soak up all that nostalgia.My only pet peeve, is some characters take a while to develop their powers and it would've been great to see more powers/matches from the chosen ones.So this movie just HAS to have a sequel since the powers were developed so close to the end of the movie .

Cano's dialog wins.Opening scene is a flawless victory.Great fights

Good to see Nathan Jones again but his scenes are fast and they never show him in side by side shots like when he fights Jax.Goro's design is cooler looking than 90's movie Goro but he did not need to die.Gore and foul language : ]
Miles better than the two 90's films.I'm ""Game"" for a pt. 2The BAD:
Yes, Cole was not needed in this film at all.Jax could still be played by Michael Jai White.Sonya Blade......meh. Her character should be ripped like Sarah Connor.Yeah some cheesy scripting but then again it's a game.The end track based on the cheesy 90's techno song was still cheesy 90's sounding with a drop of Dubstep at the end.

Personally, I liked how it centered around the conflict between Scorpion and Sub-Zero. I also like how they decided to make Sub-Zero the main villain, since he is one of my favorite MK characters.

897,dwestlow,A big letdown!,5,23 April 2021,"I guess being a Mortal Kombat fan since it's very first game release in the early 90s and following its storyline with every game release since put me in steed to have very high expectations....and I have no doubt that other out there in the same boat would agree. And with the first 7 minutes of the movie release 2 days ago, all I can say is I was overwhelmingly PUMPED! I just left the cinema and feel really deflated. It's all down hill after that first 7 minutes.....well not all actually, as Kano steals this movie! Kano's dialogue is hilarious and it is delivered in hysterical fashion. Apart from that as an upside, there is nothing that stands out to grab you in a way that excites you from a character perspective, nor in regards to action. If you are a Scorpion fan and are going based on that alone, then wow you are going to be really disappointed...you see Scorpion for a combined total of 13 minutes in the entire movie! My advice, base the next movie off the script of Rebirth. That looked great and different but at the same time very promising......",Mortal Kombat

If you don't have alot of the characters then people would whine too.If you took a MK character and made them the star, lead or hero, then that would ruin the franchise, hence you have Cole, but the movie really doesn't focus on him too much, he is just the grounding pin it revolves around.Writing is good enough, some of the jokes were laugh out loud funny.

So they expect best of the best!First, I think they should've done a better job casting for its iconic characters - actors and actresses with more spine and muscle! Just because nowadays they can do anything with special effects doesn't mean they can cast anyone for such movies!Second, the plot is again a bit Cliché - Subzero vs. Scorpion with no reason on why these two should be against one another... and also, the Cliché plot of some fighters led by a soul-thirsty leader go from one realm to another to fight and take over... why! The viewer can obviously think of some whys, but after all these years and many games and movies, we expected a better plot.So I sum it up, a movie with a spineless plot and cast!",Mortal Kombat

903,tariqxl,Overall a good movie but had some problems.,7,28 April 2021,"Firstly if you're not a diehard fan of the game, you will probably like this movie for the most part. It does lack some character development emotionally but develops them skill wise. It has some great humour mostly coming from Kano. If you're kind of a fan you'll love the fatalities. What some don't like is the underdeveloped Nitara who as a character in the game was only in a handful and mainly re-releases. She is not a prominent character. And Reiko, who again is only in a couple of games then appears as cameos. There are 64 playable characters in the game, if they were going to focus purely on character development they'd only get a few in the first movie and it would take at least 10 movies to get them all in. This is good fun to watch and makes just as much sense as the games storyline so watch it without the game in the forefront of your brain.",Mortal Kombat

You know, an exciting adventure with a violent and epic tournament to decide the faith of the world.Well, this was nothing like that. There's not even a tournament.

906,code-morse-599-990226,A real firecracker for the fans,8,23 April 2021,"Yup they definitely delivered! I went in hoping got something better than the god awful and overwrought malarkey that came before it.I have to say, though the story is rushed, a bit messy and somewhat all over the place, they really knocked it out of the park, a few annoying tropes and some cheesy dialogue come up but not egregiously so.Cole Young, while not on the surface particularly interesting really adds to the myth and is for me and is a very worthy addition, old vendettas MK fans revere are beautifully and respectfully handled and the characters really live up to their game counterparts.None of them are a slouch but Scorpion, Sub Zero, Kung Lao and Kano in particular are brilliant!This is really a set up film and it does wet the appetite, brilliant fighting and good world building, albeit in teasing glimpses.Cinematography and locations were beautifully employed I thought and the film stays true to the spirit and fighters of the franchise.Now for the missteps:
The villains with a few notable exceptions are given little depth apart from being eeeeeeeviiiiillllllll and fall a tad flat outside of fight scenes. The actors do really well with what they're given, but I would have happily taken another 10-15 minutes to flesh things out a bit.Pacing is frenetic even though the beats hit hard and can be a tad uneven, even choppy but I suppose there is some hope for an extended cut at some point. All in all I'm really excited for where they're going with it and fervently hope for a sequel, the setup is brilliant!In closing, Citizen Cain this ain't, but that's not what we're here for is it?If you're not a fan you might come out a tad confused but YouTube and fandom are your friends for this; only so much you can stature into two hours after all...The film is great fun, visceral, oozing atmosphere in places and phenomenally choreographed, at least some of it hits really hard and although some kharacters I thought were miss handled (mainly because their screen time was limited) for the MK fans this is a delicious treat and a tantalising glimpse into what the future has in store.

I can see why they released that to get people interested.The acting is pretty bad but not in a campy way like the original, just bad.The music is forgettable and you only get glimpses of some nostalgia there.There is somehow even less of the lore in this one and most of it is just explained through some overly dramatic dialogue.Cole, the protagonist is the least interesting person in the movie and you simply never care about him or his family, although they have a lot more charisma than him.Overall a pretty disappointing movie, think original Robocop Vs. The remake did you even remember they made a remake of that until just now? That's how you'll remember this movie in a couple of months.",Mortal Kombat
909,imperialwalkrnyr,Great potential...dropped ball. Will still watch the sequels tho,6,29 April 2021,"So overall this movie wasnt the worst...but like many Warner's bros films seems like it was destroyed in the boardroom. Choosing a new lead not from the games was almost as bad a decision as ""Taven"" or ""Meat"". New Lead (who's name I cant remember even a day later) seemed way to cookie cuter. His ""super powers"" (another big dropped ball for me) looked like a man in a rubber suit with claw arms. Why so many weapons. Give me the kung fu / karate first fights. The whole super power thing seemed to fall in with the new trope of having to explain everything in films. I much rather some mystery of where these extraordinary people became extraordinary. The high points were most certainly the first 7minutes + Kung Lao and Liu Kang. The fatalities and ""flawless victory"" were great fan service moments.

It is a Kombo of MK Scorpion's Revenge (2020), MK Annihilation (1997)'s Dragon marks and MK 1995's ideas all used but gone wrong.

The most disappointing thing of the movie is that it's too busy setting things up for a big payoff that doesn't arrive. On a positive note, It had great special effects, costumes, and other items.

Was this better than the original movie? Yes. Was it a good movie though? Meh.The good:1. The characters were accurate and were how a fan would expect them to be.2. The action was really fun and the fatalities were fantastic!3. Sub Zero was just amazing. And the fight with him and Scorpion was epic.The bad:1. A completely new, and pointless, character took up a lot of the screen time. He was not interesting, his story was bland, and his powers were even lamer (a suit of armor? Come on). Liu Kang should have been the focus of the movie.2. No Johnny Cage or Kitana?? Two MK staples.3. Plot was even lamer than a video game plot.4. Acting was not that great.5. Predictable.So while I really had fun watching this, and it brought back memories, was it a good movie? No, not really. I wouldn't expect a non-MK fan to find it a good movie. I think it was mainly made for the fans.I'll say this though...maybe the best video game movie ever?

Like justice league, suicide squad etc ...If you go in wanting to see cool effects, a splatter of violence and a story line that doesn't really break ground ... you'll have a good time. This is not a cinematic masterpiece. It does the job of filling in a couple hours with some entertainment.Kano was the best thing in the movie. Without him ... it would have been boring and flat. The other characters are just ... boring. There is no effort in developing them. They aren't supposed to be deep characters, but they could at least be paper thick so they didn't just fall into being generic.Could have been more violence too.

The character portrayals from the video game characters were all fantastic, so it makes you wonder why, with over 30 years of MK character lore to choose from did they decide to make ""Generic Strongman"" the main character? Absolutely forgettable through 90% of its runtime but I had to give it a few stars for the decent action (when it actually happens). It would be better to just play one of the many MK games that have a better story than this.",Mortal Kombat
926,tmwydlay,"Good, but pretty much what you expect.",7,24 April 2021,"I will start off by saying I have played the games since I was 5 years old, in arcade machines and now in my home today. The first movie in the 90's was solid and a great summary of the games. The second movie was hot trash with some decent action. This movie is a great video game adaptation but there were a few letdowns.--
THE BAD: There is no actual tournament. Shang Tsung's actor was a terrible choice, I'm sorry but he's not even remotely close to resembling the character. The middle of the movie was a bad idea... the arcana and ""finding powers"" was never something in the games. Kano's death was a joke, and not even a good one. Reiko was HORRIBLY adapted and not even remotely accurate to the suave and intelligent Outworld general character in the games. Literally no Kitana, no Jade, NO JOHNNY CAGE TIL THE END AND IT'S A TEASER??? The changes in lore/character development were kind of unneeded and disrespectful to long time fans. Jax losing his arms a different way? Okay, that's fine. Kano getting angry enough to get a laser eye? I'm sorry but no. He's a mercenary arms dealer that has a cybernetic eye and heart because of the technology he has access to, not ""dragon logo powers."" Again, a little disrespectful for my taste since I've donated a quarter century of my life to the games. Why follow 80% of lore and make such non-sensical changes to the other 20% like that? Reptile is in the movie for 2.5 seconds and dies. Kano and Sonya fighting in a bathroom was super anticlimactic and laughable.--
THE GOOD: The martial arts, while it has the trademark shaky camera effect for a lot of it, is actually very good. It's got John Wick style action even though I wish there was more of it. The character designs are true to form in nearly all cases. They absolutely NAILED Kabal. Liu Kang and Kung Lao were also perfectly casted. I miss Robin Shou but the new guy was an amazing younger Liu. Kano wasn't just funny, he was extremely funny. Excellent choice and he's nonstop hilarious. Was nice to see Mileena get some decent screen time and love. (even though again... no Kitana.This movie setup some huge potential for sequel(s) without question. It's just ironic that a lot of the good has some strange things about them or drawbacks. The storyline is obviously meant to appeal more to newer people in order to draw them in to the franchise. There are some catch phrases and fatalities that will pay homage to the old school players such as myself. The moment that Scorpion finally catches up to Sub-Zero gave me goosebumps. That was a flawless victory for sure.-
All in all, I can't give this is a 6 but definitely not an 8. It's just above average in terms of an action movie. I do feel the first movie did a MUCH better job encapsulating the real game with its lore even though there were a few changes as well. In terms of action, this is most definitely the one to beat in terms of video game movies. I'm excited for a sequel because I want more action and lore, not necessarily because I was blown away.

That combined with the brutality, and the attempt to connect you to the protagonists, this film has no idea what it wants to be and unfortunately succeeds at being nothing.The first and last fight sequences are the only two you can tell any effort was made and they themselves end up passable but are swallowed in the shadow of forgettable and even cringe-worthy plot execution. I can't tell if the acting was just terrible b-rate or the unforgivable pacing just made it seem as so.I'm a fan of the games and, for nostalgia reasons the original movie. The latter I know wasn't necessarily a good film but honestly it was paced, choreographed, plotted, and executed better than this film... and embarrassingly overall may have even had better special effects. Even the CGI was poorly done in this new film.The highish rating of this film is undoubtedly the product of a long wait for many fans and in a few months probably around 80% of people will come back to this and amend their opinions because this IS NOT a good movie.

His role is taken up by Kano who, while not breaking character, wants all the answers. The OC was completely pointless to the story and the actor delivered his lines like if he didn't want to be there. All he did was soak up screen time.There was a lot of fan service to distract from the lack of plot and by the end of we never even reach the Mortal Kombat Tournament and we get sequel baited.It does everything wrong that Scorpion's Revenge did right.

The last time I SMDH this badly was ""Late Night"" and the dire ""Ghostbusters"" reboot of 2016. Seriously, avoid this and play any of the MK games (even MK3) instead for 2 hours-- you'd have a much better time.",Mortal Kombat

The movie may have been better if it focused more on Scorpion and Sub Zero perhaps?The new made up character, Cole, was total nonsense and not needed. Just rubbish, along with his powers. Poor Goro and his tiny starring role, killed off so easily by this noob. Kung Lao was awesome! Oh and Kano constantly swearing, what for? Kano was better than that. The story line all over the place, it was like I was watching a bunch of trailers put together.

953,Teymur4,Mortal Kombat was an ok movie.,6,26 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat movie review: My complaints generic villain motive, pretty predictable, one character is supposed to be funny and isnt really funny and kind of annoying, the front half of the movie is pretty boring and the middle of the movie is kind of boring, some things in the movie are pretty generic in like a hero and villain movie, some stuff in the movie are goofy, some characters are eh and uninteresting, and one of the main character's costume looked ugly and was only for his torso. My complements the back half of the movie is entertaining and exciting and the very beginning (where Scorpion and Sub-Zero are fighting for the first time) is also entertaining and exciting, and you start to enjoy the movie more in the back half of the movie, it's a pretty cool movie, the visuals are good, the CGI is pretty good, the soundtrack/score is ok, some characters were good and interesting, there was this one scene that was really cool, most of the costumes looked cool, some parts of the story were unique, and the action scenes were really nice and action packed.

The locations and set pieces look amazing, the story is simple and steady, the fighters look great and the action is on par with other films of the genre. My only peeve is that the movie gets slow at times, but this original take on the beloved franchise is definitely well worth it. Ignore the haters that say ""there wasn't enough this"" or ""the story was trash!"" Its setting up something bigger, and I think the next few films (Joe Taslim signed up for 4 movies 😉,) so I think the next movies are going to be epic. And Scorpion finally got his due.

There were couple of average scenes but also some good ones! Scorpion vs Sub-zero (2 fights were good!). Kano was needed. I think without him, the movie would have gone flat.I thought all characters had a their own charm. Except the main one. Rather dull and unsure why he was needed/there for.Overall it's a good attempt and giving it an 8 for their effort. Good movie to watch with mates.",Mortal Kombat

Too much cut and the movement of fight was slow. For example, Sonya vs Milenna. I thought this movie will look like The Raid movie cause Joe Taslim was in it.

Another thing I don't like about it is it does not have any after the Credits there was no scene explaining Johnny cage it could've been awesome if they do that it could've been the perfect ending for Mortal Kombat movie and announce the sequel and over all my opinion on the movie I think it was action packed I think it was like the video game if you like video games you will love this movie a lot And if you like action movies you will love this movie I highly recommend it to anyone who is a diehard video game fan and I think the movie was great.",Mortal Kombat

You watch it for the cool fight scenes and bloody finishing moves. And that's what you get. The problems lie mainly with Cole, as a new main character is flat uninteresting and to be honest a little confusing. He's a washed up MMA fighter, husband and father. All while appearing to be about 23 years old. I thought his teenage daughter was his sister at the beginning g and it wasn't until the fight with Goro did I realize she's his daughter. Where the film shines is with the established characters from the game. Kano absolutely steals every single scene he is in.

I found the main character Cole to be quite dull, but the focus wasn't entirely on him so that's a good thing. Shockingly, I found Kano to be the best character with the funniest lines, and I might even throw Kabal in for that too.Kung Lao was probably the most genuine true-to-character out of all of them, his fight scenes were incredible and quite enjoyable.Overall, the movie was disappointing but as a MK fan, I still enjoyed it for what it is. 6/10.",Mortal Kombat
967,samuel-bell94,"Moments of glory, surrounded by eh.",6,7 May 2021,"Mortal Kombat has always been a franchise filled with mixed results. From it's debut in 1992 game arcades, to its eclectic sequels. The franchise has always been hit or miss. Of the two previous attempts of a cinematic adaption. 1995 left the fans slightly disappointed, but happy to be represented, while 1997 saw one of the worst films ever made inflicted upon fans of the series. 2021s Mortal Kombat is far closer to the former, than the latter. However, it seems to have forgotten what it is, and so it loses its way more often than not.When it is on point, though, Australian director Simon McQuoid does the series proud. Bookending the movie with some of the best and most violent choreography to come out of Hollywood in years. The battle between Hiroyuki Sanada's Hanzo Hasashi (Scorpion) and Joe Taslim's Bi-Han(Sub-zero) are incredible and showcase the two actors true skills as martial artists. This doesn't always work in the films favour however, as comparing any of the other actors, however talented they may be to the two juggernauts of hong kong cinema is bound to leave them feeling subpar.The film does have an excellent cast, with Sanada and Taslim actually filling in relatively minor roles, as compared to the always exceptional Chin Han in his role as Outworld's Emperor Shang Tsung, or Mehcad Brooks's Jax, alongside Jessica McNamee's Sonya Blade. But while the movie is based around the newly created character of Cole Young as played by Lewis Tan, the undisputed star of the second act is Josh Lawson's Kano. Tan is a decent actor and he does occasionally get a chance to show his shops, but for the most part, the movie doesn't give him much to work with. Allowing Lawsons utterly shameless comedy relief to shine through and steal every scene he is in.Even when the actors are able to power through their clunky dialog though, they are always at the mercy of the cinematography. Which ranges from utterly stunning, to downright painful, without any trace of rhyme or reason behind the transition. The movie often uses an amazingly framed, perfectly lit wide shot, to showcase PlayStation 2 CGI and the dissonance between the two elements is enough to give the average viewer whiplash. Emotional scenes of character development, are suddenly interrupted by a CGI version of Goro that makes the 1995 animatronic look good by comparison.This dichotomy between skill and garbage carries on in the movies numerous fan service scenes as well. Some of them are seamlessly integrated into the movie. With exact quotes woven into the script for game fans to appreciate and make YouTube videos about. Compared to others that have the actors, stop what they are doing and look directly into the camera, to say their game reference, stopping shy of winking, through an apparent sheer force of will. None of this is to say that the movie suffers from its reliance on references, rather the movie is at it's best when it forgets about the new narrative it is trying to tell and revels in its corny and ultraviolent roots.Overall, this Mortal Kombat gives the fans about 30 minutes of pure unbridled joy and 80 minutes of forgettable nonsense. Leading a 110 minutes of easily roastable, largely enjoyable cheese that cries out for alcohol and crowds to appreciate it. For anyone who is a fan of the series or just of ultraviolent films and doesn't mind a bit of hammed up dialog, gather your friends, get on the beers and make sure the children have gone to bed. This movie is a good time, if you want one, even if it does take itself far too seriously at times.",Mortal Kombat
968,Watch-Movies-Online-Free,Worse than the original,4,25 April 2021,"There is no story, just random fighting. They failed to recreate the 'Mortal Kombat' atmosphere the original movie has.

The only thing I felt lacking was the pacing and story. It's more grounded in the source material but, for every character they had could've had more time to introduce who they are.

Fingers crossed for the sequel and Baraka!",Mortal Kombat
975,whatsyourboggle,"I'd rather watch Annihilation, at least it was entertaining and visually interesting.",4,26 April 2021,"The first half hour was quite decent. The choreography was alright, the effects were weird, but it was cool to get a backstory. But once it gets to present day it all falls apart. The music in the opening scene was pretty cool but after that it feels like generic superhero music. The film on a whole has a fanmade feel to it, with music by wotsit Macleod. Hits don't look like they land sometimes and it quickly becomes a Hollywood film - I counted five or six cuts to cover Sonya suplexing someone, which took a little over a second.I went into this with no strong expectations, but not with high hopes. I recently saw the Power Rangers gritty reboot and the waste of my time offends me, and I was afraid this would be the same. I wanted to give this a chance coz I love the first two MK movies, and it IS better, but not by much. It's also extremely guilty of the Wonder Woman 84-esque ""punch a person and they fly back in a straight line like a godsdamned cartoon"" thing which makes it overall feel somehow more camp and cartoonish than the original. There is gore, which does make it feel more faithful to the video game, and they use special moves from the game, which is cool, but what could have been an amazing uppercut moment was completely undersold.Very inconsistant tone, not as fun as the first movies, I feel like visually the cast is well chosen, but somehow it still feels miscast. Nothing about it sits quite right with me. I accept that it's someone else's vision but it falls flat for me as a movie. There are more references to the games in this one but it still doesn't quite work. Perhaps with a more original sounding score, definitely a few more takes, because some line readings are simply bizarre, when we first meet Liu Kang it's worth of Sindel's line readings in Annihilation.There are hints of good writing but simply not enough to make this any more than .. a movie I watched and forgot.",Mortal Kombat

978,fandanne-766-133657,Satisfied my expectations,7,6 November 2021,"We begin with a lovely story, with a tragic end, which felt like a movie of its own. The first part was all you could ask for. Acting, story and drama. The first fight scene was epic and we, the audience, understood very well that one clan was of warmth and the other clan was of cold.After the first sequence, the screen goes dark for a good long while as we digest the information from the first part. I was at this point very excited to continue watching, and my expectations grew.At this point, it was clear that we did not continue the stories from previous movies or series, but instead this movie is an interpretation of the games.In the main story of the movie we follow Cole, Sonya, Jax and Kano. And I was a mixture of curious and disappointed to what was done with the Kano character. This low life criminal was suddenly full of comic relief and whimsy.It took a while to get over, but in the end, he became more of the evil bastard we know and love.Some of the more famous characters were intentionally left out of this first movie, and it's clear they expect to make another installation and continue this story somehow, and I'm looking forward to it. Let's just hope this goes well and we will get a sequel.I give this movie a strong 7 out of 10. The acting struggled at times, and the same actor could perform splendidly in moments later. Some of the characters story line got cut short, but I was thinking this might be a horrible movie like a 2 or 3 going into it, but after the very first scene I was just blown away. So good at times.The tag team fight with mini Godzilla was very entertaining and the CGI team did us a solid. Shame we never got to see our ninja in green.I recommend you to watch this movie.

There was no boring explanation about details, what i liked of course. The Effects are ok, they nailed it with (not too much, not too cheap), im happy with them. The fights were ""most"" clearly, without too much camera angle cuts. It is very important to have flawless and camera-shake-free fights without too much camera angle cuts.The gore gave this movie an important charm, im glad that they put it in.The part about the second family of Cole Young (Lewis Tan) was not the best, but i understand why it has to exist there (in the middle and end of the movie). I think it could have been done with an other idea better, but this one is also ok.U see in the movie why they're suppose to be the best fighters.The Fightscenes are good.I came for the fightscenes, i wasnt disappointed.They are the best part of this movie.The Final fightscene is also very good.I lost my mind when they put in the Techno Syndrome music (even if its modified a bit, but it was still techno and punchy). Im very happy to hear it in the new movie.Watching this movie at home was awesome, better than in cinema. Without disturbance i could enjoy this movie in its full potential. I hate cinemas since people started to treat it like coffee shops (Loud talking, phone lights). The Stream release was a very cool thing, which im going to support more. More movies should do the ""Home Cinema"" streaming releases.This movie got some rewatchabality and im going to watch it again ""already"".This movie deserves to be on my shelf (""waiting for the bluray to buy"").",Mortal Kombat

How the hell?"". Another thing is the main character, the new one. I dont know why they decided it'd be a great idea to introduce a new character to a franchise thats already have dozens of interesting characters. He's kinda boring, heck even his costume is uncool. They should've just focused on the rivalry of subzero and scorpion.The tournament isn't really there. It was weird. Raiden is just teleporting people randomly and they fight and suddenly the earthrealm win, its like unofficial tournament which is kinda dumb.As someone who is familiar with Mortal Kombat from its ps2 era, it was a little bit disappointing to see the muscular and bulky characters that i knew is small and skinny. Liu kang is the best example, i think he is too skinny and small as Liu kang, and Raiden does not give the 'wise god' vibe, he doesn't look that 'powerful' and also Kano, but at least he's entertaining. Probably the best character in the movie.Anyway if youre a fan of MK, i'd say watch it.

Fights difficult to follow as some of them are in the dark, the main character which is not even included in the original game, an annoying Kano, a pissed Rayden who only talks but he is not kicking any ass.

It respects the source material but the plot and the pacing are off. It would be much better if they followed the cinematic story established with the MK9-11 reboot. As it stands, I feel that even today the 1995 Mortal Kombat movie was more coherent with more likable actors. The new Shang Tsung was my main gripe and disappointment as he doesn't measure up to the 1995 one as the prime villain. A movie is only as good as the major antagonist. If you want to enjoy an MK movie watch the 1995 classic, it is still holds up today.",Mortal Kombat
1000,Pugnisher,An Almost Flawless Victory!,7,22 April 2021,"Having been in the rumour-mil for near on three or four years now (if not more), fans of the Mortal Kombat franchise finally get the live adaptation of what Netherrealm Studios has breathed its life and soul into.Mortal Kombat is brutal, fun and at times - particularly for those tied to its lore - an emotional experience for audiences. While being grounded in what the games have paved as a foundation, Mortal Kombat (2021) takes creative liberties to tie its story and characters together as well as to explain more 'bizarre' aspects of the universe created in the games.While longtime fans will get exactly what they desire from Mortal Kombat, those less familiar with the games or with no previous knowledge whatsoever will find themselves thoroughly entertained. Exposition lends to explaining the undeniably convoluted world of MK here (particularly through the likes of Sonya Blade), and thereby, poses as a good entry point for newcomers to enter the franchise with a simplified - albeit - slightly altered version of the MK timeline and story.It's worth noting that this is a bloody ride. Mortal Kombat does not shy away from gratuitous violence and rightfully so. It leaves nothing in the tank, exploding heads, arms, guts and every other variable across the screens and onto the battlefield. These phenomenally violent scenes are accompanied by well choreographed, structured and shot fight sequences, making every movement, punch and kick feel impactful and purposeful.The only place Mortal Kombat feels as if it loses traction is perhaps in its scripting. The writing at time feels lacking and leans into some overly cringeworthy dialogue. At times it works, other times not so much.It's worth noting that the humour is perfect. Whether written or improvised, the jokes land and they land hard! Kano's dialogue in particular is rapid and fluid with a heap of one-liners and hard hitting jokes which can be attributed perhaps mostly to Josh Lawson who plays him. With roots in the comedy field, there's no denying that he had a hand in the banter thrown around here.Other castings were well suited too. Perhaps the only two which felt a little iffy were that of Raiden and Shang Tsung. Perhaps it was a lack of character development and purpose, but these two felt a little less on-point in comparison to the rest of the cast.Undeniably, if this gets a sequel, I feel that there will be a remedy to this. After all, they had a great deal to jam into this thing and explain to set-up not only the tournament of Mortal Kombat but the ever sprawling world.Without a doubt worth a visit to the theatre for, this one left me wanting more and got me excited for the prospect of a series of films to follow.7/10 if all things are considered.9/10 if you're diving in looking for nothing more than a good time, some gruesome violence and killer action sequences!",Mortal Kombat
1001,dmmart-28624,Seems like they managed to piss off both sides with this one,3,24 April 2021,If you're like me and don't know anything about mortal kombat or it's lore beyond FINISH HIM! This movie's pacing and random mish mash of characters with no explanation or backstory makes it hard to follow. Based on other reviews the hardcore MK fans hate that the story centers around a new character cole young (who is portrayed by a horrible actor) instead of the more famous or entrenched fighter from the very deep and established MK roster. Basically the terrible pacing and writing have managed to isolate both old and new MK fans. Oh and there's no actual tournament in this?! Only redeeming qualities are Kano and the fight scenes.,Mortal Kombat

1006,blanston-25010,"Entertaining, but not a Flawless Victory",6,23 April 2021,"So, while the original 'Mortal Kombat' film felt like it was a goofy popcorn movie geared towards the game series' audience at the time, this reboot feels like a goofy popcorn movie geared towards the exact same audience twenty-five years later with (thankfully) more violence and gory fatalities that would have kept the younger version of that audience from seeing it in theaters (although, strangely, not from playing the games).Ultimately, I enjoyed the movie, so I'll start with the positives. First, the aforementioned fatalities have not been excised for a PG-13. The film clips along at a fast enough pace, so it's not boring, but it doesn't move fast enough that you won't notice its' obvious flaws. The Sub-Zero/Scorpion/Cole subplot is done well... although, it's also part of my criticism. It should NOT have been a subplot, but rather, the CENTRAL plot. I generally liked the characters, although in MANY cases they're not given enough detail or they make inexplicable decisions to advance the plot.I think the movie's biggest problem is it feels like WB is once again trying to rush what I assume they want to be a Marvel-style cinematic universe, as they did with their DC comics characters, and once again, they've just crammed way too much fantastic stuff into two hours, with little-to-no establishing or build-up, so it comes off as absurd. One of the interesting things about this is that you can actually see in this film the potential for an AMAZING ""Part 1"" of an ongoing film series, and it involves removing most of the characters besides Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Sonya, Jax, and Cole & his family... and MAYBE Kano. Forget showing us Outworld, too. That's for the SEQUEL.I mean, the set-up for this movie SEEMS, at first, to be that Sub-Zero is this creepy, super-powered ninja assassin, who's going around killing all of Earth Realm's potential challengers for a future Mortal Kombat tournament, and now he's targeted this film's primary character and his family. Great premise, but towards the beginning of the film there's this stark jump-cut, with no set-up, from Cole, on earth, in a cage fight, to Shang Tsung IN ANOTHER DIMENSION. You can't JUMP-CUT to your first mention/introduction to characters IN ANOTHER DIMENSION. You have to set that up, man! No one who doesn't actually play the games will even have any context or frame of reference for what they're watching. Also, going to another dimension is actually kind of a big deal, so maybe when you're introducing it, add the requisite AWE and SPECTACLE, instead of just jump-cutting to it. But that's why it shouldn't have been in the movie in the first place. SAVE IT FOR THE SEQUEL(s). Joe Taslim (Sub-Zero) plays the character very menacingly, and has the gravitas to be a memorable, Terminator-like villain all on his own. There's some great horror-movie visual styling for the sequence when he first goes after Cole, specifically the shot where Jax spots him in an alleyway and he just sort of disappears in a cloud of mist/vapor. He's your antagonist! Learning about why he's trying to kill you, and eventually defeating him with your martial arts skills and, later, the help of your undead ancestor Scorpion is your plot! Everything else can go! Shang Tsung, Raiden, Liu Kang, training in Raiden's temple, Outworld, etc., are all in your SE-QUEL(s). In the ideal, simplified version, Cole and his family narrowly escape getting killed by this creepy ninja with ice powers, and then run into Jax and Sonya who explain SOME things (as opposed to everything) to him, and MAYBE we learn a little more about them and why, when Jax killed the guy in Brazil and got the Mortal Kombat mark, they began obsessively learning about a martial arts tournament between other dimensions instead of getting him ointment for a skin rash. Over the course of the film, what they learn about Sub-Zero informs the audience about who he is, why he's there, and who he works for and perfectly sets up future films. I know ""show, don't tell"" is sort of a standard Hollywood axiom, but in this case, I don't think it works in the film's favor. I would have gone with ""Leave people wanting more"".This could have been such a great film on its' own, as well as a set-up for future films, but somebody just started CRAMMING an entirely different film into this film.Because of this, alot of the scenes/situations and dialogue feel stilted, weird, rushed and/or poorly written. So, the end product is Kung Fu meets Fast & the Furious meets Harry Potter... Don't get me wrong, it's very entertaining in its' own cheesy way, and, as a Mortal Kombat fan, I appreciated seeing alot of my favorite characters like Liu Kang and Mileena, but from a storytelling point of view, it lacks restraint and focus.",Mortal Kombat

1009,ildudeentertainment,Far from a Flawless Victory,6,28 April 2021,"Hollywood and video games have always had a rocky relationship, with countless video game adaptations either being completely horrible or only sharing the game's name and not much else. With that said, Mortal Kombat was easily my second most anticipated movie this year. Having been a fan of the games since I was a kid, I was ecstatic when they announced a movie and my hopes only rose higher after the trailer showed off the action the franchise is so well known for and actors that sold the part they were playing. With that said, the movie itself definitely had its highs and lows.Off the bat, the movie does nail the aesthetic of the games with each of the actors looking the part perfectly. This is amplified by the costume department doing a remarkable job of transferring the video game designs to the big screen. While Scorpian and Sub-Zero's designs were a little less traditional than some of the other characters, they still looked really cool on screen. The costume designs that truly stole the show were Kung Lao, Jax, Sonya Blade, Kabal, and Liu Kang. Watching each of these characters on screen was a nerd dream come true in terms of physical appearance. It's very evident that these designs were taken into great consideration. This is why it was a little surprising to see Kano without any of his trademark cybernetics. Maybe it was done to avoid rehashing the plot of Jax gaining his cybernetic arms or they're waiting for the sequel, but it just seems like they could have made him a cyborg from the start of the movie, and nothing would have changed other than pleasing fans. Of course, cool designs can't carry a movie all on their own, and while actors can look the part, that doesn't mean they can play it.Truth be told, I didn't find any of the acting in the movie to be awful, but they also weren't particularly good either. Max Huang did a pretty good job as the stone-cold and arrogant Kung Lao, but the character never really had a chance to shine or develop so ultimately any range he might have been able to show was lost. Mehcad Brooks did a great job as Jax Brooks and seemed like he had studied the voice acting done on the character in the games. Having seen him in both Supergirl (2015-2021) and TrueBlood (2008-2014) it was clear that this character spoke and behaved differently from his usual soft-spoken and laid-back characters. Many of the other actors seemed to range from the mediocre to okay range, except for Josh Lawson as Kano. Anytime Kano found himself running his mouth, which was quite a bit, he outshined every other actor that was on set with him and genuinely made the movie way more enjoyable during the non-action scenes.One thing that this movie completely nails is its action. Many of the fights are a real spectacle to watch and it's awesome seeing the characters use their moves from the games. While from a pacing perspective some of the action scenes seem to break out almost randomly, in a way that is reminiscent of how people randomly break out into dance in musicals, it did remind me of how the same things happen in the games. Many of the characters recreate their iconic fatalities from the games and they're just as bloody and beautiful as any fan could have hoped for. The only downside to the action was at times the fighting scenes were so chopped up in editing in an attempt to show different angles or to hide the fact that the actors didn't know how to fight as well as their characters do. All the action in the world can't make up for the faults of the plot, however.While adapting the plot to a video game can be hard, especially a game that mostly relies on fighting over a story can be quite a challenge, and unfortunately, that's what the writers of Mortal Kombat had to deal with. With that said, the Mortal Kombat games have had a pretty good story as of recent, and 9 completely streamlined the plots of the first three games which is why it's weird that this movie decided to not follow any of it. While it wasn't surprising to see some changes to the story, no one expected such massive changes such as not featuring a Mortal Kombat tournament. Sure maybe it's because they're planning on building to it in the same way MCU has made building to large events a staple of modern Hollywood, but it just seems like the writers wanted to do their own thing. This however isn't even the biggest issue with the movie, as that one lies in the hands of the new character Cole Young.Now Cole Young is problematic from the start because he's essentially supposed to be a stand-in for the audience so that the characters can deliver exposition without it not making sense in world. This however gives the movie a more gimmicky plot than the games ever had, dealing with chosen ones selected by fate and unlocking arcana (superpowers) that can only be achieved if you have a symbol that leaves their chosen fighter if they are killed and end up on the victor. None of it makes a ton of sense, and it seems like it's only there to explain how Cole Young can go from being a losing MMA fighter to prophesied Mortal Kombat champion. What makes this even worse is the fact that MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD they included Goro in this movie especially only to have him be a human punching bag that allows Cole to unlock and show off his new abilities. This changes tons of other characters from the game, like Jax who is just a cyborg in the game but now unlocks his robotic arms, and Kano who in the games is also a cyborg and able to shoot lasers out of his cybernetic eye only for the movie to make it a superpower. A similar thing happens with Sonya Blade who in the games uses futuristic bracelet guns that shoot energy, but here she just produces it after defeating Kano END OF SPOILERS. In short, the addition of Cole Young really just did more harm than did when it came to explaining the lore of the world.Overall, I did enjoy watching Mortal Kombat, being a fan of the game helped as I was able to geek out watching iconic moves being performed, seeing characters I love pop up, and of course, briefly hearing the game's legendary theme song played. That doesn't mean this movie didn't have a great number of flaws, from mediocre acting, unnecessary changes to the plot from the game, and just Cole Young as a whole. If you're looking for an entertaining movie, with a lot of good action and a pretty terrifying villain definitely check it out. If you're a fan of the games you will find yourself both incredibly happy at times and incredibly disappointed at others. Overall I would give this movie a 6.3/10 because I thoroughly had a good time watching it, but it was far from a FLAWLESS VICTORY!!!",Mortal Kombat

It's the only good and solid part of the movie.1.) Story-wise nothing really happens in the movie, basically no progression at all. The team training and assembling was basically the whole movie up until the end where no repercussions were made.2.) Majority of the casting sucked, especially the main character who was a big wimp during the whole movie. Also, why did they think it was necessary to make Mileena black? It literally adds nothing to the character. The only good casting choices were Jax, Hanzo Hasashi and Bi-Han3.) The only noteworthy VFX within the movie were Sub-Zero's ice and how Goro looked, that's about it really.4.) For a Mortal Kombat movie it had a pretty low amount of gory scenes. They probably had around 3 big gore scenes in the entire 1 hour and 40 minutes.5.) The last scene where they fought in the boxing arena is probably the dumbest thing I've seen in filmmaking in a while. Why did Sub-Zero even take them there? It absolutely makes no sense.

But no he's out just so we can have boring new guy Cole. When a video game movie creates new protagonist, it means disaster. Look at Resident Evil. There are tons of awesome characters to make the lead, and they make bland new guy with bland powers? He's got a super generic backstory , and a bad design too boot and he certainly can't take out Goro, one of the most powerful fighters. They did most the characters dirty too. Sonya is nowhere near the badass she normally is, Jax spends most the movie with baby arms, and Liu Kang and Kung Lao are barely characters.Then with the bad guys, why did they choose no namers??? Reiko? He's one of the most hated characters of all time! Nitara? She hasn't been in a game for like 10 years! There are dozen of awesome bad guys, but they choose the d-list.And what's up with Sub Zero being this ultimate fighter who can't be beaten by anyone? Yeah he's pretty good, but he's not seen as a final boss.Finally, the worst thing the movie did is the Arcana power thing. It makes no sense. Why would magic give robot arms and an eye? And Sonya blade has no superpowers. She's a military vet using military tech and weapons. And the fact that everyone's powers comes from the same place robs everyone of their uniqueness. That's one thing that is appealing about the games. Everyone's abilities and powers are drawn from completely different areas.

1034,alanguidon,Great addition to the franchise,8,8 May 2021,"This movie brings a lot to the table, but it misses out on some key points too. Where they got the casting right, they absolutely nailed it. Hiroyuki Sanada and Joe Taslim as Scorpion and Sub-zero were absolutely perfect above all else.One thing they got wrong was the decision to bring in a new character in Cole Young. The character was boring and pointless. I felt they could have done better with the casting of Shang Tsung too but maybe I'm being picky.Good movie overall. A lot of fun and worth the watch, especially if you're a fan!",Mortal Kombat
1035,wantoncravings,Mediocre Fatality,4,17 May 2021,The movie tries to re-engage MK fans. Sadly it falls face flat in trying to bring anything good to recommend about. My advice is to watch it because you wanted to waste your time. I will take 'Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge' . The animated movie has better acting expressions and a better story line to engage someone who really wants an action movie.,Mortal Kombat
1036,yranslow,Pretty decent film,6,11 June 2021,"When it comes to video game movies, most of them have failed incredibly. When it comes to Mortal Kombat, it is a complicated situation. If you compare it to other video game movies, it is by far one of the best. It had some really cool action scenes and the cgi was decent. But if you compare it to other movies, it's not the best. I think mainly because of the failed protagonist. I mean, I give them props for trying something new. I think it's a great idea to create a new character, so that character isn't limited to the boundaries placed on fans of the source material. You can do whatever you want. But in this situation, they made a pathetic protagonist. I mean, he's very boring, has no character development, and his ability is to grow a long sleeve shirt.....pretty pathetic. All and all, I enjoyed watching it, but looking back I see there are some problems that could've been done better. But this movie was made by a brand new director, so kudos to him for making a decent movie.",Mortal Kombat

As far as technique and martial arts skill, the movie is better than the game. (Not a criticism of the game.) The character costumes are much better than the original movies.

1039,FinalSmash1689,Such a missed opportunity,5,23 April 2021,"Pros:
The Opening Sequence is AMAZING!!!The Fight Choreography is great.Hiroyuki Sanada is the BEST Actor in this movie.Sub-Zero actually feels very threatening.Cons:
THERE'S NO MORTAL KOMBAT IN THIS MORTAL KOMBAT MOVIE!!!!!!WTF is the point of Cole Young? All these amazing original MK characters and the studio says make a new character as the lead. TERRIBLE Decision!!!Lewis Tan is not a good actor especially considering he's the lead! In fact most of the actors either didn't fit their character or weren't trying hard enough.The Dialogue is BAD. Especially when using the lines from the game. Felt so forced!So many wasted characters: Reptile, Goro, Kabal, Kung Lao etc.Liu Kang, Raiden and Jax were all underused.The villains, aside from Sub-Zero, we're very flat and unthreatening.The script is WEAK. They should've scrapped it and started fresh.I was cautiously looking forward to this. I really loved the games as a kid and the trailer looked great! Sadly, the trailer is the best thing about this film. Every decision feels like a misstep. I don't know who decided to not have the MK Tournament but that was such a mistake. The film has no urgency without it and honestly just felt like they were stalling for time the entire film just to set up a sequel. It's like they were checking boxes with each scene with nothing authentic holding it together. You really don't feel anything for the characters outside of Sub-Zero and Scorpion, and Scorpion is only in two scenes. This whole film feels like a missed opportunity. The animated film Scorpion's Revenge is still the best MK adaptation to date. If you enjoyed this film, I'm happy for you but I struggled to keep watching it. 5/10.",Mortal Kombat

It struck the perfect tone, the fighting was well done, and it was funny.The original movies from the 90s took themselves so seriously and had such stiff fight scenes.I thought this movie was just excellent.

The script is terrible, where there's actually NO TOURNAMENT at all.But the worst of all are the locations: the entire movie has been shot in a studio with green screen with literally no stunts or other people involved.",Mortal Kombat
1043,alexander-iv,Not even Mortal Kombat brand can save this,3,5 May 2021,"If you're working on an iconic franchise like Mortal Kombat, with all the heavy lifting already done by the creators of it, at least put some effort into writing a proper script and dialogue.The 2021 return of Mortal Kombat to the movie screen is plagued by horrible, weird dialogue that will make you wince from the embarrassment of having heard it, and frantic, disjointed exposition. Characters are introduced in the most clumsy, cringe-inducing and illogical ways. As if it was penned by a group of twelve-year olds during a lunch break.Of course, this is not a movie one watches for the story, but some standards have to be followed in a high-budget production as this was.The only saving grace of this 1h 50m flotsam are the special effects and the fighting scenes, which are masterfully done and beautifully shot.But with such a proposition, you might as well just play the games for two hours and get more value out of your time.",Mortal Kombat
1044,madroxdk,Downhill after the beginning,3,25 April 2021,"It started so good and looked like they were taking it seriously, but then the scene changed from the stuff in Japan and everything went downhill. This is more of a direct to DVD comedy than a serious action movie. The CGI was subpar with quite a bit of it looking worse than the old movies, outside of the animality stuff in Annihilation. The story and most characters were a joke. Kano was the best part of the movie and he was entirely comic relief. The main character was crap and his costume looked like something bought at Spirit Halloween. The action scenes were largely poorly choreographed, with actors clearly pausing to let the other one hit them. Overall, I'd put this movie on par with MK Annihilation, only beating it due to somewhat improved CGI. Definitely worse than the first MK.This is worth watching in the same way that Sharknado is worth watching. Don't expect any more than that level of quality.",Mortal Kombat
1045,Nylistic,Stick to the cheesy 1995 version,3,23 April 2021,"I liked the 1995 Mortal Kombat film as a kid and it had me humming the theme song and acting out the action scenes in my room. It was a cheesy, not too great movie, but fun and unpretentious. I wish I could say the same for this 2021 version.There's some good stuff here like cool character designs and some occasionally great action but aside from that everything is very subpar. Scorpion and Sub-Zero deliver the action but the rest of the fight scenes are extremely bland and not nearly as gory as hyped. Combine that with an overabundance of CGI and surprisingly bad cinematography and you've got a movie where I felt only about 10 minutes of it was worth watching.The script is really what drags it down. Instead of just focusing on characters from the Mortal Kombat roster, we have Cole Young (Mr. Everyman) to lead us on this adventure. It's a bad decision to begin with but the character is completely uninteresting and the movie's bad acting and dialogue make it all even worse. The references to the game were well done at least.",Mortal Kombat

Both actors played their roles amazingly.Cons!!!There is no tournament in this entire film that's supposed to be about a tournament.Kano is annoying throughout the entire film.Cole the main character shouldn't even be in the movie. He is one of these characters where if you took him out of the movie and left the others in the movie the entire concept wouldn't change.Because this guy has 1/8th of Scorpios blood in him he is apparently a chosen one...
What about Scorpios daughter?? Who was rescued by her father? Wouldn't it make more sense to make the story about her?Lord Raiden is the guardian of the good guy realm and should have been the one to gather all the fighters but he actually has almost no reason to be there since he doesn't do much.You have Sonia Blade who apparently knew about Mortal Kombat for 7 years but didn't know where the base was but ironically Kano knows where it is even though he's never b.",Mortal Kombat

1065,thevision-44664,Mortal Kombat 2021: Movie Review,7,28 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat: 3.5/5 StarsTo start off, I would say this movie has been clearly created in such a way which will ultimately divide the audience in two sections. 1. Those who are pleased, neglecting the flaws and 2. Those who will criticize it due to an underdeveloped screenplay. To be honest, I kinda find myself on the latter position, but as the movie passes on, the entertainment is brilliant.The plot is good, similar to it's previous Games and 1995 Original movie. It's the Mortal Kombat tournament and the Outworld, your typical BAD GUYS, are doing BAD THINGS. I will come directly to the point of pros and cons.Pros:
The performances are great. Cole Young didn't bothered me. He is a good addition and a clear character. Tan portrays him in a good way. The standouts, who stole the show are definitely Scorpion, Sub Zero and Kano. Sanada, Taslin and Lawson are nothing short from brilliance. The comedic timing of Kano is great. I honestly need more of this Scorpion and Sub Zero.The other characters: Blade, Raiden, Jax are okay. Not bad to watch, they're fun too. But compared to them, Kung Lao and Liu Kang are Awesome. The violence, brutality and FATALITY is seriously one of the most goriest things on screen. Jaw dropping gore. Especially, the FATALITY of King Lao.... hahahaha superb. McQuoid did a supreme job to light up the audience with violence. The action and the background score are nothing which can be said diminishing. Works perfectly. Especially in the last 45 minutes. Flawless victory I have to say.Cons:
The characterization of Shang Tsung is the one I didn't dig. His motives aren't shown more desperately. He just wants to cheat and win. No that ain't enough, give something more! The screenplay clearly shows how much more is left out. Some characters are.. just there. They appear on screen without any type of story behind and there you go, you know them. That's it, no characterization. There is no Real Mortal Kombat Tournament shown. Also no kind of justice given to show how much more the World Of Mortal Kombat Tournament really is. It's soo much fast paced, it misses many many vital points of explanation. Feels hollow. The runtime should've been 30 minutes more. Director McQuoid said that the acion sequences are something never seen on screen before, sorry it wasn't that spectacular. These kind of action is seen before, nothing new.Overall, I'll say the movie isn't bad. Definitely watchable, one or two times. You'll enjoy. Idk whether it works out well for the gamers and the hardcore MK fans over the years, but for the general audience, it's kinda watchable and definitely enjoyable flick with some shining and cheerful moments to watch, ultimately making a somewhat satisfying experience. Far away from being a perfection, but some crucial action, acting and direction saves it from going to hell.Mortal Kombat: 3.5/5 Stars.",Mortal Kombat
1066,wabevilacqua,Hollywood's at it again,2,1 May 2021,"Seems like people are giving this high ratings just because it has violence in it. The old movie from the 90's didn't have a single drop of blood in it and still managed to be a better Mortal Kombat movie than this crap.Plot is absolutely horrible. It's incredible to see how professional hollywood writers, people who get paid tens of thousands of dollars to make this, can take a dumb plot from a 30 year old videogame and somehow manage to make it worse. Not to mention everything is delivered in such a corny way by a cast who can barely act.This movie look like what would happen if an AI was trying to make a stereotypical bad hollywood videogame adaptation.Butchered storyline and characters? Check.Protagonist is a movie-only character who barely fit in the universe, while other beloved characters are thrown to the sidelines? Check.Horrible acting? Check.Random lines and nods from the game that makes you cringe? Check.And on top of everything, the action also sucked. The fight scenes were so badly directed, full of continuity errors and weird cuts, with sometimes the characters being at a differente spot in the scenary than they were in the previous scene.Even if you're not familiar with the source material and wouldn't be bothered by their ""reimagining"" of the story, this is just a bad movie.

I enjoyed this movie for what it offered but I can't shake the potential it faced. The plot could have been more directed towards it's origin without the new creative changes. It is an over saturated movie to say the least and doesn't deliver as it could. There is a clear indication that as of late, anything Warner Bros touches, they ruin. Anyone who revives this video game adaption needs to be more conscious about the unique tone and overall attitude.

There was no solid character development and the main character is basically some random guy inserted into this universe. He was not needed in any capacity and really ruined the movie. The acting was mediocre at best and some lines were just downright cringy. On the plus side the choreography really kept me invested to continue watching.

1084,weetman-43235,Solid 7... needs some improvement,7,25 April 2021,All fairness this was a great attempt. But... i wasn't feeling the constant jump from place to place for each scene. The story and scenes honestly seem to rushed. Slow down guys. The potential is there! Just slow it down build things up more. Gutted to not see more of prince as usual. Make the fighting scenes more longer and more focussed on one fight.A game of Mortal Kombat is one fight at a time. Not 5.The great part probably is the fight between Scorpian and Sub Zero but killing off Sub Zero that way so quickly felt embarrassing really. He's a key character. Wanted more from this bht again it has potential to go that extra further. Listen to the fans and improve from this.Also characters earning their abilities the way they did?? Jacksoms arms appearing from nowhere? Come on? Seriously?... might aswel give them morphers and tell them to say its morphing time.

1092,garatelorenzmarlo-82219,View from an avid fan of the Video Games,6,26 April 2021,"SPOILERS AHEAD!The movie was over all ""OKAY"". I was excited for it. You know corny the storyline of MK ARMAGEDDON was? Well, this movie was pretty much similar. Let me start by sharing the good points of this film. The CGI's were very good and impressive. Goro and reptile were impressive during their scenes. Subzero and his costume was absolutely great! I have no complaints there. The fight scene between Scorpion and Subzero was phenomenal! Kano absolutely stole the show. Kano was great and the actor portrayed him very well and i was impressed by him! I absolutely loved and enjoyed the Easter Eggs placed in the film. The times where we saw Kitana's fans, statue of Shao Khan, image of Delia, Quan Chi's Amulet, and much more.Now the bad points, i'm sorry for ever dumping this on you but the storyline was corny and did not make much sense to me. I wish they could've picked a better actor for Raiden. In this film, Raiden seemed monotonous and did not feel like a leader. This actor gave Raiden no justice. Liu Kang was alright. I may have had larger expectations for Liu Kang since he is the Champion of Mortal Kombat. I did not like how mileena was portrayed as well. I was expecting more pink in her outfit and with a mask. The mask to give her a little mystery and once its removed we'd all be at the edge of our seat! Nitara was killed and that fatality was awesome but she did not get a fighting chance which made me remember how Sheeva died on that MK film back in 1995, so short and quick, oh how unfortunate. I am still confused and dumbfounded on who ""Cole"" is? This character did not excite me in any way and he confused me all through out the film.",Mortal Kombat

1095,shareelatasha,This was really fun,7,25 April 2021,"Overall this was a fun movie and I like most of the changes that they made and the way they did things. The main things I liked was the action sequences they did have, the fights were fun. I like how they really started from the basics, the way most of the fighters weren't really good at first. I enjoyed this idea of finding your Arcana. It was exciting to see them earn thier Arcana, and the ways they would find them was interesting. I like the idea of Sonya blade not having her mark to start with. I was looking for Scorpion the entire movie. I like the way he came in at the end in a surprise way, that was cool. I was okay with him not being in the movie more because they can always do that in the second movie. It felt like this was more of a origin story, it was like they really wanted to start from the beginning and I like that. That gives it room to grow because now the second one has so many things it can do. I think we'll see scorpion more in part two (if they have one) and we'll get to see Johnny Cage. I was looking for Johnny Cage the entire time and I like the way they mention him at the end and we get to know he'll be in the next one. They saved him for later and that's exciting because there's something to look forward to in part 2. I also enjoyed the way they did a lot of the lines that the characters say and they did a lot of the signature moves, that was exciting. I didn't mine that the movie slowed down a bit in the middle, because I get that they were building it up; plus that gave it substance. I also enjoy how gruesome this one was because that gave it a less cheesy feel. There was really only one big thing I didn't like and that's the fact that there wasn't a tournament. I think if there would have been a torment, I would have given this a 10 because that was missing and I enjoy that aspect of Mortal Kombat. The fight match ups that we were looking forward to seeing were kind of rushed and placed close to the end of the movie. It would have been better if they were inside a tournament, and drawn out more. That was one of the things that took away from this being great. Overall I really enjoyed this and I think they did a lot of things right. It is really easy to make a Mortal Kombat movie cheesy, they really made this one have substance. So over all this was a win and I look forward to part two.",Mortal Kombat

1098,Jim_E_Cornette,Test your might...not quite.,6,25 April 2021,"Josh Lawson as Kano is by far THE highlight of this reboot, and the fights are quite entertaining. But I'm not optimistic about the chances of a sequel, since unfortunately the reboot itself leaves a lot to be desired.Far too much exposition far too early. Feels like there's at least half a movie missing in the beginning, regardless whether you're familiar with the lore or not. And they took far too many liberties with the source material.Terrible pacing & scenes ending abruptly. The entire story felt rushed.They kept mentioning the tournament, yet there was no tournament to speak of. They jumped from Scorpion's origin straight to 21st century Annihilation, with SubZero as a glorified extermination squad.They went overboard with the gore to cover up the mediocre script and weak story.Zero character development for most characters, especially the bad guys, leaving us scratching our chins as to why ""some"" are on Team Outworld since they're human.Puppeteers in 1995 did a fantastic job at bringing Goro to life, front & center as Shang Tsung's champion. Yet in 2021 they couldn't create half-decent CGI for such an iconic fighter. And it's pretty sad that the reigning Outworld champion & Shokan royalty was demoted to lowly extermination squad duty, and couldn't last 5 minutes against a washed-up MMA fighter with hardly any powers to speak of. Sheeva or Kintaro would've been a far better choice for the job.Terrible Shang Tsung performance from start to finish. Chin Han made the role look like literally anybody could've been cast. Not a patch on our original Sorcerer, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, who should've been brought back. So what if he's 70 years old? Shang's role was 100% passive here. And Cary was still as good as ever in MK Legacy.Completely forgettable soundtrack, which is a cardinal sin for a Mortal Kombat movie, since the music of which was always a boasting feature - even if the rest of the movie wasn't up to par. The hideous ""Mortal Kombat"" theme remix in the credits was, frankly, insulting to listen to.21st century reboots tend to stink, and this one is sadly no exception. Now we wait to see if they'll make enough money to decide whether they're gonna bother with a sequel in order to introduce characters that should've already been in the first one.This so-called reboot has been in development hell for over a decade, and I'm definitely not holding my breath for a sequel. At this stage I would've been happier to get the cancelled 2nd sequel to the original, Mortal Kombat: Devastation. Or at least a MK Legacy season 3.",Mortal Kombat

If it was to turn people who never engaged with the franchise in any way before, probably even better.Shame on whoever wrote this lazily put together nonsense that has nothing to do with any established storylines, nor manages to tell a sane, internally coherent story if we discount the first, and frankly main issue. I'd say this cliché riddled, phoned in pile of **** manages to find the perfect balance between facepalm and cringe, but no, somehow it breaks both of those scales at the same time.The story starts at roughly the right place, though watching the Shirai Ryu get exterminated by the Lin Kuei feels sort of like Batman's or Spiderman's origin story: overtold. Then the unnecessary ""main character"" is shoehorned in, and you know what, I'd be borderline willing to step past that if he was not a character with no traits. I don't mean he's boring, or vanilla, I literally think that when the character was ""developed"" the writer(s) forgot to come up with a personality.And let's not forget about this ridiculous ""arcana"" concept, that allows iconic characters to do what they do without their established gear or cybernetic implants, or in the most extreme case allow them to magically manifest high-tech cybernetic prostetics. The sheer level of laziness in the writing here is detestable.Shame on the director too, who deserves the same kind of props, I never realized you could get performances out of otherwise talented actors that are stiff, over the top and boring at the same time. ""Give me your best crotchity grandpa with kids on his lawn and dial it up to 12"" must have been a sentence heard daily on set. And when the cast and crew were finally free of this ""genius"" and post production finally started, the sound team suddenly had to start putting up with the daily instruction: ""Now put a sci-fi noise in for that magic event"", while the editors had to work with this: ""Okay, so we dirped hard on the fight coreography, so just chip-chop this scene into sub-second pieces so nobody notices that.""The dumb, campy 90'-ies Mortal Kombat was 12 times better than this lazily slapped together. The one good thing about this being so bad, is that the next reboot (however many decades we might need to wait for it) will have to be a home run. It's a simple recipe: get an iconic cast of characters together, get them to Shang Tsung's island by minute 20 and then do the tournament. Nail the fights, the characters, put in some appropriate character devlopment, a dash of humor and crank the epic to 11 at the end. A blind hamster could do it ;)",Mortal Kombat

Even the 2011-2013 mini-series had a better idea of what was involved to make it worthwhile to the franchise and fans, but this is nowhere near that level of creativity or style.All in all, it comes across like they've found a load of basic character profiles from teenage fan-fiction writers and came up with their own idea of what ties everyone together...It's not terrible, but it's not what I'd consider Mortal Kombat either.",Mortal Kombat

1113,jota-b,"2021 Special Effects, 1990 storyline",7,23 April 2021,"I believe that I'm speaking for most fans when I say that I was expecting this to be loyal to the original storyline - a thought that the movie trailer ended right away. Instead we were presented with lots of deviations, and a sort of ""prequel"" that states a hope to build a cinematic universe around Mortal Kombat for the coming years, which don't get me wrong, is a very good thing. What I do think it's bad is the general acting - regarding some exceptions - along with character build up. Outworld characters appear to fall from the sky with little to no storyline attached to who they are and where they came from, when there was a lot to tell, especially about Shang Tsung, Mileena and Kabal. Actors playing Liu Kang, Kung Lao and particularly Raiden were close to average, along with their argument which was little to none. Kabal's voice was also not adequate to its figure. The guy's breathing through a metal mask and is stuck in an ""iron lung"" and sounds like a young wannabe highschool bully.Now the big elephant in the room, Cole Young. Adding a new character isn't that bad, but a new protagonist... that's an entire different thing. It's a very risky move, mostly because not only shatters the whole storyline, but also because a main character needs to be likeable to the general audience in order to stand. Personally, I found him closer to indifferent than good or bad, just kind of there. Fortunatly we can see that at the end, there's an intention to bring Johny Cage, who should already be present nonetheless along with Kitana (how can we have Mileena without Kitana?).Also there were some unecessary scenes, like Nitara (totally random choice by the way) literally appearing on screen just to die in the following second, following the footsteps of Rain in MK Anihalation. One way to get around that and other unsuited scene changes would be to increase the movie's lenght or simply not screening the character at all.On the upside, Kano's role is incredibly well performed and gives the movie its whole humour, bringing balance and a reality feeling to it. The fighting sequences are good, well shooted from a nice different set of angles, with a lot of movement variety. It's also noticeable they gave enourmous attention to Sub-Zero's special effects, which I think is one the best things in the movie along with some easter eggs like Shinnok's Amulet or Kitana's Fan. Goro's animation is also on a good note.Last but not least, the final standoff between Scorpion and Sub-Zero didn't let down. Very well shooted with an original choreography, and still managing to be loyal to some of the most iconic original moves from the game characters.To summarize, it's a generally well done remake. Although needing a lot of work, mostly on actor's performance and argument, has potential to set the foundations for an upcoming cinematic universe to be explored, which after all these years, MK absolutely deserves.",Mortal Kombat

The suits look rather silly, as expected, and the CGI is everpresent in great surplus. However, the cinematography in regards to the visual aspects, lighting and angles are beautifully executed.

The CGI isn't bad - the special effects for all of Sub-zero's powers are really good actually.I played MK1, MK2, and a bit of MK3 a lot as a kid and this movie keeps that vision in mind.

1133,d-wanderer,It's an OK attempt,6,4 May 2021,"If you're a hardcore MK fan you'll either hate how much it deviates from the actual story in the MK games or you'll love it, because you don't care about that and just wanna see the characters on the big screen actually using their powers in their fights and stuff.The good - the fight choreography is amazing in this! They really made sure the fights look good. No other live-action MK movie or TV series has done fights as legit as these, so you'll definitely enjoy that aspect of the film.Another thing where the movie excels are the VFX. All the special effects are nicely done, I don't know if they went all CGI or CGI + practical, but it works and it looks good.Lastly, the characters themselves (with 1 exception) are portrayed very well in terms of personality (not so much abilities and skillset). I'm watching them and thinking - yeah, he would totally say something like that. No dialogue felt out of character.The bad - unnecessary made up character for the movie that doesn't exist in MK lore (Cole Young). I don't know why movie makers keep doing this BS (think Resident Evil and Alice), when adapting video games into movies, but it's always bad. If they want to put a new character in it, fine, but no, they have to make them the main protagonist as well.Also you can really tell all of their money went for the characters and their powers (VFX), because literally all of the sets are ugly and bland. The only two sets, that were nice, were the beginning one and the final fight scene one. Everything else where just empty deserts and a shack (really the SP brand of the US military operates from a shack? Since when is Sonya Blade trailer trash and a conspiracy nut?). If you've played the games you know how beautiful their settings are. The Wu Shi Academy isn't some boring cave in the desert, Outworld isn't a slightly differently coloured desert, either. Was this an actual movie with a movie budget or a YouTube production?Finally, the story itself is sub-par as well. Main character is super boring and I didn't care for him or his family at all. The whole ""arcana"" sub-plot was completely out of left field and very not MK lore friendly. No tournament? Even the 1995 MK movie at least had the that in it. Just not sure if the story writers have ever played a Mortal Kombat game or just googled the usual characters that are on every roster and decided to make some plot around them.Despite all, I can tell that some effort was put in this and the actors cared, so I'm giving it 6/10, but I really don't see a sequel happening after this one.",Mortal Kombat

1146,coreyjameshines,pretty good/pretty bad,8,28 April 2021,"I felt compelled to review this movie, as I grew up playing the MK games. Its by no means perfect but it was really fun to watch. It felt like it had all the elements of the game pretty on point, it suffered from its pacing unfortunately. I loved most of these elements, my main issue was the story, or better yet the way it was executed. This movie could have been 30-40 minutes longer and would've had a bit more time to breathe. It felt like there was no distinction from the second and third act, it all kind of just happens like a hurricane and then it ends. I'm rating this so high because I want this movie to do well and see the movie franchise potential, and for the first scene, which in my honest opinion is a masterpiece.Sub-zero, Hanzo, Kabal and Kano were all phenomnal. The rest I could give or take, Cole is kind of a redundant character and they should've just began the story with Jax and Sonya investigating the tournament from the get go. In the game it is the special forces unit (and of course Johnny Cage) that is the ""outsider/new comer"" to the tournament so why they felt they needed Cole is a bizarre choice. Also not gonna lie I had flashbacks of ""Annihilation"" in the last act. The scene where they are in the void is so cheesy its cringy, but I'm glad for the most part the film didn't take itself too seriously. I suppose it translated the literal ""choose your fighter"" ""finish him"" to the big screen.It is unfortunate that Scorpion is so vacant from the film that we lose connection between Hanzo and Cole, as we see so little of them together. Again if it had more time breathe, like including Scorpion in more scenes aside a few flashy dream sequences, it would've paid off better. They could of had training scenes with Scorpion/Hanzo and Cole to learn his Arcana (don't even get me started on what the fuck ""arcana"" is). Cole's family should've died, some deeper connection than linage. Anything. Oh well. Also doesn't this mean Cole is Takeda?The gore is of course great and it was fun to see the ridiculous fatalities, though I half expected to see the most infamous fatality, Sub-Zero's heading ripping/spine dangling, considering he was the main villian. If he killed Cole's family that would've been huge for the story, such potential wasted.",Mortal Kombat
1147,satishgaribah,Mortal Combat....'They Spelt it wrong',5,24 April 2021,"The movie is average at best. Good fight sequences, a few fun fatalities. The storyline with Sub-Zero and Scorpion was decent but the best storyline in the movie. The casting could have been better. The acting seemed rigid and more like a bad 90's movie. Some of the settings in the movie were shot beautifully but then others seemed very poorly constructed. The lack of the tournament was another downside. The CGI with some back ground settings and Goro were excellent and then there were some CGI moments that looked extremely fake..like the Lui Kang Dragon Attack on Kabal .

From MK9 to MK11 and the animated movie, Scorpion's Revenge. But what I've witnessed was a monstrosity from this 2021 movie. It's worst than Mortal Kombat Annihilation. At least I enjoyed that movie. The directing was rookie and the writing was child's play. Not sophisticated at all. The music score was generic and didn't add any tension to the scenes. But the dialogue and acting were the worst parts of the movie. This movie boasted a list of C-list actors. I felt nothing from nor did I care for any of their characters. I didn't feel like the world was going to end. There was no real stake perceivable. After all none of the characters took it serious anyways. Raiden was a joke and useless. I hated Cole, the new character. The only characters I liked visually was Kung Lao and Kabal. Everyone else was blatant. The design was poor. The director had no real vision for the movie or respect for the source material. The time allotted for this film was also too short as everything felt like it was happening within fifteen minutes.

putting political agendas into your stories, your characters, or your writing when creating worlds from imagination--ruins your creation with your lack of imagination.This film, thankfully, has a minimum of this compared to more recent releases which are just painfully unwatchable due to an inability to absorb the viewer by ruining the imaginary world with real life problems or beliefs from the screenwriters who often let that bleed into scripts lately now more than ever.Plot was better than the 90s version in a lot of ways but had bigger holes in it than the predecessor and it's sequel, but the visuals were obviously better as the CGI has drastically improved in the past 30 years.But is CGI really the driving force behind what makes a movie watchable? I don't know, I'm just the audience, and I prefer less flashly more gravitational films from 30 years ago, because they're more believable as an imaginary world simply because the real world problems aren't brought there (as they probably shouldn't be in the entertainment industry which is driven by IMAGINATION:)In short, more creativity from creators would be preferable, overall, and this film does have more creativity than others released this year, so kudos for that.",Mortal Kombat

Extremely messy non-interesting story plot which completely lacks the excitement and understanding of MORTAL KOMBAT.Some of the lines and acting were cheesier than the 1995 Mortal Kombat hit. Given, there were some golden lines in there that made me laugh, but I felt it was trying entirely too hard.Seriously, how can you have Cole Young but not Johnny Cage?Liu Kang just seemed so awkward? But holy cow, that dude is ripped!Cole Young's family even seemed awkwardPros:

Ok... this looks promising. After that, it becomes a completly different movie. And the worst part is... it is never declared MORTAL KOMBAT!For real! The whole movie is about the fighters, and several plotlines that doesn´t make sense, and to be prepared for the tournament, and the tournament never officially starts! There is no Shang Tsung island! There is no Mortal Kombat!But the fights could save it, right? Not if we present charachters without context or reason!

Following him, I enjoyed SubZero and his fight scenes. Sonya Blade wasn't too bad too. One character that i had no interest in was the main guy, Cole. He was just boring and unnecessary. Even his ""power"" was....blah. I wish they had Liu Kang as the main guy, his story is more interesting. Another disappointment in this was the lack of tournaments in this movie, that was supposed to be the main plot of the whole movie. In addition, they did Goro dirty in this. His fight scene was short and missed the mark, and even though he was the big villain in the first movie, they showed him for less than 5 minutes in this one.

Shujinko didn't work for Deception, what on earth made them think a new hero straight out the gate would in anyway go over well with the fans.Lui Kang is as useful as Nitara.. spoiler alert; she doesn't do anything besides fly and get killed.. well I guess that makes Lui Kang only slightly more useful.And of course, the protagonist is able to beat Goro but needs help with every other fight.. makes sense.. not.And the final fight.. is just a grudge match.. with the protagonist barely able to chip away at ice, but is needed for the victory..This might as well been called Scorpions Legacy.. because this was as much Mortal Kombat as Mortal Kombat: Special Forces or Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero.Reminds me of another very big middle finger to fans; Dragon Ball Evolution.. yep I am going to put this on the same level as Dragon Ball Evolution.Except worse, this relies heavily on swearing and straight up blood and gore to resemble the original.Conclusion, what was the point?",Mortal Kombat

1186,paulegofuchs,Bloody Good Time (But That's It),5,5 May 2021,"We're entering into an age where video game adaptations have a shot at ACTUALLY being good. Sonic the Hedgehog, the most recent big-budget video game film to hit theaters, surprised audiences all over the world with how decent it was. So, when news hit of a new Mortal Kombat adaptation, I had my hopes up for another miracle. While I think ""miracle"" is a bit of a stretch when looking at the end result, I'd say we certainly got another digestible, enjoyable, and faithful video game adaptation that gives me hope for the future of the franchise it establishes.For those who don't know, Mortal Kombat is a series of fighting video games that put heavy emphasis on delightfully gory and bloody violence. So, it'd make sense that a new adaptation of the games - bolstered by modern special effects and the recent success of other R-rated films - would take a similar approach. If violence is what you're looking for when watching the film, you won't be disappointed. Mortal Kombat revels in its fight sequences, which are peppered throughout the runtime. Some of these combat scenes are done breathtakingly well. For instance, the two one-on-one fights between Scorpion and Sub-Zero are skillfully choreographed and edited, with the latter of the two fights featuring an excellent use of special effects demonstrating the characters' powers. A handful of fights between the supporting characters during the film's climax aren't done quite as well but are still fun enough to bolster my enjoyment in the film. Those fights also feature heavy use of the ""fatalities"" seen in the video games, which provide solid fan service while satisfyingly increasing the gore factor. Unfortunately, the film also includes quite a bit of ""meh"" action, which is characterized by rapid cuts, sloppy choreography, and a lack of the intense, visceral feel that embodies the better action of the film. Several of the movie's most important, gut-wrenching moments depend on these lower-quality action scenes, which rob those moments of their impact.In addition to gory violence, the Mortal Kombat video games put a heavy emphasis on their large rosters of characters. Again, the new Mortal Kombat film follows suit in this regard. There are many, MANY characters that define the film, almost all of which are pulled from the video games. Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Sonya Blade, Jax, Raiden, Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Kano, and Goro all feature prominently in the film, each to varying degrees of satisfaction and execution (though one thing they all share is excellent costume design: they look exactly like a fan of the games could have hoped for). Scorpion, while lighter on the screentime than I would have hoped, is easily the most interesting of the adapted characters: the arc that sees him seek revenge against Sub-Zero for the death of his family in the 17th century is well-written and intriguing. Sub-Zero does his part as a supremely menacing villain - the ice that creeps up on characters as he approaches creates a sense of dread reminiscent of horror movie tropes (which makes sense since James Wan is a producer on the film), the way he mercilessly kills innocent bystanders sparks fear of his lack of restraint, and Joe Taslim's performance in the role breathes life into the character. Sonya Blade and Jax were my two favorite supporting characters, as their portrayals sufficiently capture the personas seen in the games and make their presence enjoyable and welcome. Kano was a standout as well - to good effect, Josh Lawson holds nothing back in his portrayal of the loud, crude, brutal mercenary. Other supporting characters fall to the wayside: Liu Kang and Kung Lao - both prominent figures in the games - are relegated to roles as walking exposition dumps. Goro shows up in the film for a few minutes to menace the protagonist and disappears far too quickly. Raiden looks cool but adds little to the story. Other characters from Outworld - like Maleena and Kabal - serve as little more than cameos.Strangely, I found most of the supporting characters - even those demoted to small roles - more memorable and more interesting than the film's protagonist: Cole Young, an MMA fighter and original character not seen in any of the games. His inclusion in Mortal Kombat works well in theory: as someone new to the world of Mortal Kombat and unfamiliar with the supernatural abilities of the film's many characters, he had the potential to act as a ""vessel"" for audiences to discover the fantasy world through. In execution, however, he simply comes off as a bland, uninteresting, one-dimensional character with little development or reason to care for his success. This is a complaint I have seen from every mainstream critic on the internet, and one that I wholeheartedly agree with.Finally, the writing in Mortal Kombat leaves much to be desired. The character dialogue is... not the best. Much of the conversation - especially later in the film - is focused on explaining exactly what's happening to audiences and delivering mounds of exposition that is either irrelevant or implied through the actions of characters. I also pondered many of the decisions made from a worldbuilding perspective. The way the script approached the backstory of the warriors of Earthrealm was unnecessarily convoluted and raised many questions. For instance, why do the warriors of Earthrealm have to be ""chosen ones"" that are born with the dragon tattoo? Why can't they just be skilled individuals looking for a way to defend Earth and make a difference? Why do those that kill these chosen ones get to take their place if the Mortal Kombat tournament is governed by destiny? Why do these warriors get granted superpowers (""arcana"") and why is there no consistency with how they unlock their abilities? All of these were questions I didn't receive answers to, and the fact I was asking these questions in the first place suggested that the writing could have gone in a much simpler direction.Despite its noticeable flaws, Mortal Kombat still managed to be an enjoyable movie. I appreciated the faithfulness to its source material - at least in terms of character portrayals and its characteristic gratifying violence - and had a great time with some of the action sequences and the Scorpion vs. Sub-Zero rivalry. There was enough in the film to keep me entertained to the point where I'm genuinely excited to see what follow-up entries in this new franchise are able to deliver. Subsequent films simply need a stronger team of writers to bring greater depth to the rich fantasy world introduced in this film. While I doubt I'll sit through Mortal Kombat again any time soon, it was still a good time to watch on HBO Max. Those looking for a well-written, thought-provoking film will be disappointed, but those looking for a bloody good time may find what they're looking for. I'm giving Mortal Kombat 5 out of 10 stars.",Mortal Kombat

I am a lifelong Mortal Kombat fan who still plays MK11 competitively and loves the lore of MK and continued to follow the games every single release since the 90s. This movie felt extremely rushed, the CGI was terrible. Acting was horrid, almost child like. Felt like I was being pranked. Liu Kang actually threw 4 kicks in the entire movie! WOW! 4 KICKS! The god of kicks for the champion of earth realm, threw four kicks and barely got any screen time. The movie made no sense. There was no build up. The action was decent, but didn't truly represent Mortal Kombat and all its glory.

The Scorpion Sub-Zero conflict being central was a great key to restarting this franchise. I thought all the actors and actresses did a great job. Even the Melina she's gonna eat me look. The one I praise the most is the actor playing sub zero. Tough roll to pull off and not only did they do so, I haven't seen someone move like that since Bruce Lee.

1195,Treiden,Awful,3,25 April 2021,"You know, it says something when a movie from the mid-90s, when nobody knew how to do video game adaptations at all, still manages to vastly outclass this reboot.And that something is bad.Mortal Kombat has got to be one of the most vast fighting game franchises when it comes to lore. So many diverse and interesting characters that you can use to make a genuinely interesting feature film out of. So why in the name of all that is good and holy did they decide to make a completely new character that NOBODY cares about? And you've got to think the writers knew this themselves, because this new character is just so, so, SO bland, he makes oatmeal seem spicy.Aside from that, some other fun changes the writers decided to implement was the absolute lack of a tournament. In a franchise that revolves around, you guessed it, a tournament. Oh sure, they TALK about the tournament constantly, but it's all just teasing for what I can only imagine has to be a sequel that you'd otherwise have no interest in seeing after suffering through this travesty of a film.So the movie's main plot device is the ""markings"". Basically, what this means is that you can only fight in the non-existent tounament if you have one of those markings. You see, these markings are magic plot devices that give whoever has one superpowers. Not even kidding. They have a different name, but they legitimately describe them as superpowers. Oh, and it gets better. If you manage to kill someone with a marking, you then get their marking and suddenly, wham bam, thank you ma'am, now YOU have superpowers.Because having special abilities in a fantasy movie simply through sheer force of will or training was apparently too far fetched.And I have to imagine the writers didn't care one whit about the giant corner they were backing themselves into, because some of these powers are... well... questionable. Jax, whose arms get ripped off at the start of the movie and who gets teeny tiny metal prosthetic arms to replace them, has the ability to make his metal arms... useful. That's it. So the only reason they didn't build him some actual functional arms to begin with, was so that the writers could actually come up with a ""superpower"" for him.Oh, and our protagonist? Not even kidding, he has the superpower to get his ass kicked in a shiny metal jacket. That's it.So, story issues aside, the casting is also all over the place. Kano is brilliantly cast and thankfully appears in a large chunk of the movie. Scorpion is great too, but less thankfully only shows up in two or three scenes. Jax and Sonya are fine, but underused.LITERALLY every other MK character they cast in this, was a terrible, TERRIBLE casting choice. Shang Tsung and Liu Kang look like RuPaul's Drag Race rejects. Raiden's actor BARELY speaks English. I'm talking Jackie Chan in Rush Hour type Engrish, it's THAT bad.But what bothers me the absolute most about this, is the blatant attempts at fanservice. Wait, no, let me rephrase that. HORRIBLE fanservice. Shoehorn as many characters in as possible (Nitara has a whopping screentime of 2 minutes before she dies), act out some fatalities from the game, utter some hilariously bad and awkward punchlines from the game, all for the sake of recognizability, and not caring how utterly ridiculous it looks. I mean, in the heat of a large scale battle, who does a victory pose and then says ""flawless victory"" to absolutely no one after a one on one fight? Especially with other fights still going on around you? Honestly?If you want some entertaining MK live-action, watch Legacy. Hell, watch the original from 1995, even. I'd even go so far as to recommend MK: Annihilation over this. That movie was terrible too, but that one, at least, was entertainingly bad.",Mortal Kombat

1202,samaras09,Not quite a Flawless Victory but still a solid start for the MK franchise.,8,24 April 2021,"I have to start by saying as a fan I really enjoyed this from start to finish, yeah it has its flaws but from a director that usually films commercials I'd say hats off he has done well especially to take on something as big as the MK franchise as your first movie. To start with the positives I thought the whole look and feel of the movie was great the settings and locations used really good fitted in well especially Raiden's temple was cool you got a small look at characters that are still to come especially the big statues of characters that will no doubt come into play next time mainly Shao Kahn. I really enjoyed the the build up of Scorpion and Sub Zero I thought both of them looked great!! I massive upgrade from MK 95 also the fighting scenes very well done looked awesome people have had ago at the CGI but honestly I thought it was not bad at all I've seen alot worse from films with much bigger budgets the sub zero scenes with the ice was very cool...... pardon the pun, thought Goro also looked pretty good. I also like how they stuck to the game with this you get a good look at a few characters as well as signature moves you get to see a couple of fatalities not alot but the ones you do see are done really well and this ties in great with the movie being rated R I mean it had to be MK and blood and gore go hand in hand so that was good. I have to say Kano stole the show for me he was brilliant he definitely had all the best lines for sure him and Sonya just clicked from the off. The flaws nothing in this world is perfect so without being to harsh I'd say the big thing for me was the lack of tournament I really wanted to see that I mean there is absolutely no tournament at all, also Cole Young the lead character he's not something you've never seen before basic back story of being the chosen one he doesn't know he's the chosen one you know how it goes. Also the acting at some bits you would think they are reading directly from cue cards. The lack of character back story is something more than just myself has said but in a film that's 1hr 50 long with that amount of characters it's impossible to delve into detail. If you are a fan and watching you'll already know who's come from where but still you would of expected a little more on that front. The two big things for me that I didn't like was no Johnny Cage!!! Even though at the end you know that Cole is actually on his way to Hollywood to find Cage on his quest to find other champions so you know he's going to be in the next movie for sure. And the last thing is the last 30 minutes they have rushed it packed everything into it just to get it done all the big head to head fights over way too quickly though they were still good just too short especially the Scorpion v Sub Zero showdown at the end absolutely awesome especially the fatality I just wanted to see abit more. All this being said it is a solid start to what is to follow and is definitely one for the fans I give it a strong 7/10 definitely the best video game to movie we have had in a while well worth a watch.",Mortal Kombat

I wasnt expecting it to be as good as Mortal Kombat 1995, but i was surprised how good it actually turned out to be.The fight scenes didnt drag on too long which i find gets old and most didnt go along w/ the horrible trope of: good guy fights bad guy, good guy is nearly defeated to then come back from that and win the fight. The film also had some pretty funny moments and lines during some of the slower scenes. The call backs to moments of play or scenes from the games that came out of the 90's was a nice touch, like when Scorpion reappears near end and uses some of his famous finishing moves or how some people became they way they are, like Jax's arms.Overall, I felt is was enjoyable and nearly on par w/ the original film.",Mortal Kombat

1208,amin-kahdouei,Big disappointment,6,25 April 2021,"I'm a all time mortal kombat player and fan
I usually don't write bad reviews or give bad ratings but for this movie i was really excited and it failed badly
Here is the reason why:
Changing the original story in a bad way including goro's death. Subzero death. Mileena death(not the death and fatality itself but too soon in my opinion). Kung lao death. Lack of scorpion screen time. Too soon to add a original character descendent.And now about the acting such as raiden acting was not the way you could take seriously. Also shang tsung the same(both of them because of bad acting and bad voices). Jax's body in my opinion was not muscular enough. Sonya wasn't that serious military girl.and also mileena not good. Kano was good. Kung lao and liu kang were meh.No outworld characters backstory
No mortal kombat tournament
Fighting scenes are not that epic and good(looks like cheap low budget fight scenes)
And so many other things that ruined the movie
If there is going to be a sequel they should change a lot of it to make the game better
But lets not just be all bad and negative
Hanzo and bi han were both good (lack of scenes for hanzo)
Kung lao fatality and liu kang dragon was soooo goood
Hanzo and bi han fight scene was really amazing(excluding the cole young)
Customes were okay and some good(kung lao and hanzo good the rest okay)
Overall this movie could have been sooo much better if the crew of mortal kombat game and Ed Boon would have make it. Even james wan as a director and putting and aquaman like effort(even less) would have make this movie great.",Mortal Kombat

HEAVY SPOILERS !!!Was a fan of the franchise as a teenager, and a big fan of the original movie also. What could have been a good action flick combined with a tragic story became a nausea inducing ""female empowered"" unfunny mess:
There is no Mortal Kombat tournament. There are several fights, badly cut and the first five and last ten minutes are awesome. The rest of the movie is utter garbage.Sonya submits Kano with several moves in the first part of the movie, like she's toying with him. Later on, he puts her in a rear naked choke and she survives for half a minute there. That the hell? Yeah, I know, it's a movie. Let's just not be idiotic when it comes to realism, Ok?! And then, out of the blue, with a SINGLE fatality move, she kills Mileena... Because girl power, of course. Her acting is laughably bad. It's like acting school first repetition bad. The story she tells Jax, about running 20 miles in the first day of training, to pump him up? Bwahaha. Pathetic. Yeah, she's beautiful. No one cares. Not enough frame for a fighter. Bring Gina Carano. Bring Ronda Rousey. They look muscular and can fight. It's not believable to have a 50 kg girl fighting an 80 kilo man and easily submitting himShang Tsung is almost irrelevant. Compared to the actor in 95's movie, this one is a parody. ""I came for your souls"" in the new movie quote does nothing to me. The original actor, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, makes me shake even now. Soul sucking is worse than in the old movie.Where the hell is Johnny Cage? Ah, yes, we must pander to the feminazi crowd and destroy any chance of having a white male as the good guy, right?Let's just pretend he'll be there for the next fight. In the sequel. If we get to have a sequel. Not interested in seeing it, to be honest.Raiden is non existent compared to 95's movie. Accent is bad, Raiden doesn't have a strong presence unlike Cristopher Lambert.Humor is forced, some lines from Kano were funny though.Liu Kang is worse than the original one, somehow. Plank acting. He looks like a teenager unable to fight his way out of a paper bag. Not the body, he's athletic and cut. But the face is definitely not up to the role. Old movie's Liu Kang was much more badass. Sorry.The script is bad overall, despite the huge materials from the cartoons, game, comics.Who freed Scorpion from Netherealm? How come he knew where to come back? Where is he going?Mileena is black, not Asian as in the lore, because pandering to the Twitter rage crowd is more important than following the storyline and having an evil twin sister of Kitana. Can't act. Useless as an actor. Despite filling the diversity quota, of course.Goro looks like an orc from Warcraft. And he dies of the hand of the first fighter he's up against. What the hell?! Goro is top tier in the games. Here, he's big and dumb.To make the non-fans even more confused, the script added Cole Young, mediocre MMA fighter, which doesn't exist in the original lore. Because bad scripting and reinventing the wheel with ""Arcana"" powers. Bad. Bad. Bad.Watch the first and last minutes of the film and play the games. Or read the comics.I'm giving it a two star rating because of the movie's first minutes (top notch) and some CGI effects throughout.Other than that, the Scorpion movie from Legacy series from 2011 had much better Scorpion eyes. Michael Jay White was infinitely better as Jax. Orders of magnitude better.Maybe the next one will be better. In another ten years or so.",Mortal Kombat

The fatalities were done in gory fashion. I wouldn't expect anything less.The fight between Scorpion and Sub Zero was well done with a slight twist. That I didn't expect.Cole turned out to be very important in the story. Completely unexpected and well thought out.Over all the movie delivered everything I wanted. Being a fan of the games since 1992 this was a monumental moment in movie history.I think there will definitely be a sequel with possibly a third movie. There are many characters they can bring in. If done right there may be more than three movies.Here's hoping 🤞",Mortal Kombat
1213,rizkyrarung,Worth it for that last fighting scene in the gym,7,15 July 2021,"Firstly, i kind of like the decision not to rush the tournament right of the batch and take times to introduce its character. Kind of nice even though the delivery is a bit lacking. Once they reach the temple, it is so boring. Liu Kang here is a meh for me. Simply plain just like that. Don't get me started on Raiden. In fact lots of the character is just lacking soul except Sonya and SubZero. SubZero is badass.However, everything considered, i am excited for what is in store for Mortal Kombat franchise. That SubZero-Scorpion fight is just awesome. Give us more fight like that and better script. It will be massive.Overall, enjoyed it and feeling nostalgic.",Mortal Kombat

Absolutely. That gives me hope for the sequel and makes me excited for it. The end was a little rushed with some of the fights but the ending itself was well done. And the fatalities...wow!!!

I always liked the characters and the style of the games but I don't play fighting games. That said I don't know the story line and I'm sure the movie wasn't very accurate to them. As someone with an outside perspective I would say this was a decent and fun movie to watch. I felt like it takes way too long for Scorpion to show up and the movie feels like they rushed the progression of the story to get more content squeezed in but it has a good deal of fighting from favored characters. There were a bunch of one liners and fatalities directly referenced from the games. Some felt like they had to stretch a bit to put them in. Honestly die hard fans of the games probably won't like it.Overall I wouldn't call it a great movie but it wasn't bad either.,Mortal Kombat

After the last...ALL the Mortal Kombat movies made, my expectations were not lofty.Positive:The inclusion of the Hanzo and Bi-Han showdown was a fantastic way to start the movie. Scorpion and Sub-Zero are two of the best characters in the series and they have deep background stories. I was happy to see the movie do these two justice.Keeping more true to the original characters. I was extremely happy to see that the race and ethnicity of the characters was generally adhered to. I'm still a little scarred from the whole Christopher Lambert as Raiden thing. It also helps that roughly half of my favorite Asian actors were in this movie. I was still hoping for Ken Watanabi, but we can't have everything I suppose.Flawless Victory! Direct quotes from the games were something I legitimately enjoyed here.Negatives:I spent most of the movie trying to figure out who the hell Cole Young was. I know the main canon of Mortal Kombat, but I'm by no means an expert. I couldn't place him and I also couldn't figure out why they would focus on such a boring character in the first place. I finally looked him up after the movie and found out he was created specifically for this film. Maybe he'll be more interesting in the sequel?",Mortal Kombat

1241,carlosarmandorocker,A Enjoyable trash,4,24 April 2021,"One of the main problems that an adaptation of this type has are the director and screenwriter who try to give their own imprint to the story, they will never accept to adapt everything as it comes from the original source and that is their main sin, they think they are too good to invent. Citing as an example ""Joker"" is still a very free version of the origin of the villain but the director and screenwriter did not forget where the character comes from and that shows in the story they tell us taking things from one story and another from the comics to create something fresh and functional while still making the character their own. IT IS A GREAT STUPIDITY to create a protagonist out of nothing having so many characters to choose from; that's the sin #MortalKombat has by not believing in the original source and improvising on the fly, it would have been easier to create a story focused on the rivalry between Scorpion and Zub-Zero, give the protagonist to Liu Kang as it has been originally, they could also focus on Johnny Cage or the enmity between Sonya and Kano. There was so much to choose from instead of inventing a 💩 character with a 💩 development and a 💩 family 💩 what do they end up importing a 💩!, besides what a lousy actor (actually they all act so bad what make you miss the cast of Mortal Kombat from the 90s).This is the typical case of ""lousy movie that becomes enjoyable because of how absurd it is"".The fights are decent but nothing spectacular, the special effects except when Zub-Zero shows his power are improvable (sometimes they sing too much), the story is rushed and very poorly developed (the fun of Mortal Kombat is that everything revolves around a tournament and here there is no tournament).A ""fanservice"" very poorly carried out.There will be people who enjoy it and despite the stick I'm giving it I also enjoyed it at times, but there were also some ridiculous moments that made me SMILE.If there's one thing that makes this movie worth watching with all its flaws, it's seeing Sub-Zero use his powers, the Scorpion vs Zub-Zero moment and the level of violence.",Mortal Kombat

Kano is an Earthrealm warrior but changes his mind and turns when his greed for $$$ is offered from Kabal.

There should've been more of a backstory between Kano & Kabal shown early so we understand the dramatic.Cole's ""chi"" is an upper body armor & the weapons used during fighting.

I think they nailed it with Kabal. However, the acting is no better than what you would see in a game cinematic.So, I stopped watching mid way and put on 1995 Mortal Kombat.

1256,mravelin,Honest Review From A True Mortal Kombat Fans,6,18 April 2021,"I will make this an non-spoiler review so everyone could see it. First of all, i just want to say that i already play mortal Kombat since 7 years old, its really fun games with great character. This movie make every fans really freak out and really excited to see an upgrade and new concept that this movie offer from the trailer.Before i start, this is an honest review, i am truly objective to review this movie as a fan and as an audience. This movie starts really well, they show us a little bit bloody and gore of the fight sequence, the story itself really promising at first. But, when we are in the middle of the movie, i don't know what happened, the script seems lost and i think they really forgot the main purpose of the movie, sometimes the script out from the track, like everything suddenly happens and appear, and ngl a little bit boring. The main character (Cole Young) (btw he is a new character and not original from the game) is really rubbish, i'm really hate how they make the development of his character. They are confused and forced the character at the same time, they really messed up every character development, and the writer seems really love sonya blade? Sonya story is not really interesting but they too much exploited her character to be appear in every scene (idk why). Kano its really surprising character in here, i'm not expected he is to be the funny one, so yeah they make his character really well. But poor jax, they Introduce him really well and suddenly disappear. And if u ask me about sub zero, he is the best character in here, and u cant change my mind. Also, They need to make Tsang Shung and Lord Raiden character a special place to delivered their story and performances, a little bit fight and origin story maybe?Some acting performance really weak (you will know when u watch it), but some of them also have the best performances (Read: Joe Taslim), if we talk about costume of CGI or another special effect, well i can say its really good. The scoring was not bad but actually they could make it better, and i prefer they used the old mortal Kombat theme. Last but not least, the editing is really messed up mann, like at near the climax i am really confused and dizzy to follow up the fight scene. So yeah you need to really focused on that.There are nothing new with the story, its kinda flat and predictable. But at the end, if you just like me (a true mortal Kombat fans), come and see the movie, the fighting, the gore, the FATALITY its delivered really well, the battle its not bad. U can still enjoy this. But if you want a good story and a good character development, this is really disappointing. And btw i watch it on IMAX, and there are no IMAX sequence, you can watch this on regular studio or Dolby Cinema or HBO MAX.I'm sorry for bad english, i'm not from America 🤙Conclusion:
+ Great Costume
+ Great Special Effects And CGI
+ Amazing Fight Sequence
+ SUB ZERO Character
+ Fatality, Finish Him, Mortal Kombat!!!!!+ Great Movie as an Fan ServiceStory is dull and confusingBad Character DevelopmentBad Editing Near The ClimaxSome Bad Acting PerformancesKinda Flat6/10 from me.",Mortal Kombat

The movie then starts to introduce new characters every ten minutes or so the new character to the franchise is Cole this is where the movie loses marks he's generic and never really does anything that makes you love him like the classic character before him , the acting on a base level is okay but does leave you wanting I think the problem is no one wants to steal the show but the characters who are in the movie briefly.My overall conclusion this is 7/10 but could be so much better with more character development, it is very much sequel bated and I'm looking forward to more.",Mortal Kombat

Debutant Cole played a downtrodden, depressed dad, it would've been nice to follow him to his downfall to connect more with him, before Found his new purpose. But, he did well with what he had, and his combat is on point! Hopefully build on him - which brings me to this - after 20 minutes it's clear what you're watching is a prelude to something much more vast, so don't panic about what might be missing!

If they wanted to bring in a new character don't have him belittle the legends of mk and have him beat goro and help scorpion beat subz. Have him learn from these and then get strong.. I'M not even interested in the sequel because of the new guy.Some characters was played really well, kano, kabal, kung Lao, sonya and jax and of course subz and the little bit of scorpion. But some of the others just didn't fit into the characters usual.. Raiden at the start seemed like he was gonna be ruthless.. But he didn't do anything really which is a shame he always played important roles oh and lui kang just seemed more a healer in this.

I feel like the writers wanted to create a universal relatable storyline for non MK fans. That being Cole fighting to save his family, motivation, etc etc, however it completely detracted from the other characters that the spotlight should have been on. This was obviously a prologue and entry point into what will be an expanded universe in a sequel, so let's support it and get more movies greenlit and hope the director and writers carry on knowing what worked well and what didn't from this movie.",Mortal Kombat

I liked seeing the characters from the games on screen and thought that for the most part, they were well adapted. However, the writing is pretty bad outside of the main plot idea, the main character in particular is very dull in my opinion and should have been replaced with a character from the games. I don't understand why they felt the need to make new characters when the MK franchise already has literally HUNDREDS to choose from. There is quite a bit of fan service that sometimes hits and other times feels cheesy, along with the comedy- some of it hit, and some of it felt corny. The performances were very mediocre with the exception of Josh Lawson's performance as Kano which was spot on and probably bumped up my rating by 1 star. Overall, if you are a fan of the series then I would recommend watching it but not having high expectations, if you do so then I think you will have a fun time. However I would not recommend this film to anyone who isn't interested in the MK games/universe.",Mortal Kombat

1301,waynewashington,If you don't care about plot & you just here for the Fatalities then you'll be pleased,6,25 April 2021,"It was an OK Mortal Kombat movie at best. Felt more like a PREQUEL than an actual legitimate MK movie. Here's what I liked and didn't like.What I LIKED
1)The actor who played Kano deserves a raise because he gave a show stealing performance. At one point I was routing for him and I accepted the story-line change of him fighting alongside the Earthrealm fighters.2) The character of Sub Zero was a force to be reckon with. You can tell a lot of the special effects and fight scenes were well done whenever Sub Zero was involved.3) The Final Fight scene between Scorpion & Sub Zero.4) Kabal was a nice surprise despite lack of build to his character.5) The little nods to game like Liu Kang's fatality, Kung Lao's fatality, some training moments, and some Easter Eggs.6) Liu Kang and Kung Lao were decent despite having minimal screen-time.What I DON'T LIKE
1) It's good to know that I'm not alone when I say that Cole Young didn't work for me. He really doesn't add anything new other than summoning Scorpion for the final fight. It would've made more sense for the payoff to his power aka ""Arcana"" was turning into Scorpion rather than getting a armored long sleeve shirt and tonfas. There were scenes where Cole was having visions of Scorpion so that's where I thought they were going but nope. Liu Kang should've been the main character cause Cole easily gets lost in the shuffle of MK characters. If they make a sequel, Cole will get lost again especially since they're alluding to Johnny Cage and more fighters to take part in Mortal Kombat.2) If you're a fan of Scorpion you will be disappointed as he truly has one fight with one opponent. Thank god it's Sub Zero but Scorpion is a popular MK character and he was willing to fight anybody and everybody. The treatment he gets here is underwhelming compared to how he is treated in his own animated movie, the games, and even the low budget Mortal Kombat: Legacy show.3) When Kano switches sides and joins Outworld, all of that charisma is gone and he's just a throw away villain. It's like whoever wrote the script just gave up. Would've been cool had this version of Kano stuck to being a good guy cause he had great character interactions with the Earthrealm fighters.4) With the exception of Sub Zero and maybe Kabal, ALL of the Outworld fighters were just thrown in and used as cannon fodder. You could've replaced Reptile, Reiko, Mileena, Nitara, and Goro with original characters like Cole Young and you would still get the same movie. Goro was the biggest offender because in the games he was one of the final bosses. Even the movie took the story-line element from the games that Goro was the nine-time MK champion. In Goro's one and only fight in this movie, he's defeated by Cole Young of all people. Again I would've accepted this if Cole's Arcana was him turning into Scorpion.5) Raiden & Shang Tsung were totally miscast. I understand Raiden is supposed to be asian, but Raiden is suppose to have a presence and an imposing look since he's a Thunder God. The actor playing Raiden doesn't cut it and comes off as annoying with a broken English accent. I would've preferred Benedict Wong as Raiden cause he would at least sound like a Thunder god. Shang Tsung is played by the Mob Accountant from The Dark Knight and he's not intimidating as an Outworld Sorcerer. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, the Shang Tsung from the original MK movie, was a better actor who was more threatening and had good screen presence. Shoot Cary Tagawa could've reprised this role cause all Shang Tsung does in this movie is suck the soul out of Kung Lao and that's it action-wise. I thought the casting of a younger Shang Tsung would mean he was going to fight but that wasn't the case.6) No memorable soundtrack like the original MK movie. The soundtrack didn't get good until the Scorpion and Sub Zero fight at the end.7) Majority of the fight scenes were rushing to get to the fatalities and even then the movie doesn't allow you time to sink all of that in. The quick cut editing during the fights doesn't help either.8) THERE'S NO TOURNAMENT. The movie spends time mentioning the MK Tournament multiple times but it actually never takes place. This took out of the movie big time. Every fight is an ambush rather than a tournament match where the fate of Earthrealm is at stake. You know like every single MK game. Say what you will about the older MK movies and MK: Legacy but at least they understood the tournament and the stakes behind it was crucial to the story.9) The explanation behind ""Arcana"" and the dragon birthmark symbol didn't click with me. It was only written in to give a BS explanation on why they have special abilities and participation in a tournament which doesn't take place. Nothing else.10) The final fights before Scorpion vs Sub Zero was a MAJOR letdown. If you've seen the trailers to this movie then you've seen those fights because they last up to 30 secs in the actual movie itself. The set up to that was stupid because Cole tells the Earthrealm fighters after they all got beat in one on one ambushes, the strategy was to fight them one on one again with Cole saying the Outworld fighters fought well as a team but not alone. Call me crazy but there wasn't a single moment where the Outworld fighters worked together nor combined their abilities to stop the Earthrealm fighters as team. They beat them one on one, period. Raiden then teleports everyone to fight and Shang Tsung does nothing to stop Raiden even though he's a sorcerer who's breaking the rules in the first place. So what's stopping him? Budget constraints perhaps? After these short fight scenes come and go, Cole specifically told the team that they would all take Sub Zero together. This doesn't happen as Sub Zero fight Cole all by himself till he summons Scorpion. So what's stopping Raiden from sending the other Earthrealm fighters to help Cole Young? Budget constraints perhaps? That whole sequence is where I felt the writers just gave up cause it felt lazy and out of place.",Mortal Kombat

The cast was not excellent (obviously no A-listers) but from among them, the best acting goes to Kano (Josh Lawson) by far. The actress chosen for Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee) was very beautiful, but too bad she did not have the right curves. Mileena (Sisi Stringer) also had the same flaw.

I will admit that my taste is generally not blockbuster action movie lately, but I can definitely appreciate one when it is done well. I found the pacing very inconsistent. I thought some parts were dragged out way too much, and other parts, especially as the film went on, were rushed. The story got choppy, and the dialogue was bland. The characters were well cast, and Jax stood out to me. The visual effects were done well. The fight choreography was also impressive. As much action as there was, I was looking for a little more.

1317,MasterOfTheMovieverse,Wasted potential and poor use of characters.,6,4 May 2021,"This film had so much potential but poor storytelling and an incredibly boring lead really lets this down.What I liked:
The opening sequence between Hanzo Hasashi and Bi-Han was fantastic, to be honest the whole film could have focused on this great rivalry. Set against the back drop of a tournament this could have made for an incredible revenge story. What a wasted opportunity.Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Jax, Sonya and especially Kano (who is steals every scene) are well casted BUT there is literally no backstory or any character development to any of these players and as a result they all feel flat.What I disliked.Cole Young, please get rid of this character in the follow up! He literally sucked the life out of every scene that he was in.Kung Loa's death, needlessly pointless and felt like a plot device, just so Shang Tsung could steal a soul. A potentially decent character that was completely wasted.Kano's death, why? He was incredibly fun as a villain and would have been great in any potential sequels.Goro was treated poorly! In the game he was the prized champion of outworld, undefeated for 500 years, in this film he gets offed by a complete novice who has lost every fight and sparring session that he's been in up until that point.Special abilities are written as super powers and the lead characters power is laughable. The dude becomes a human punch bag... Literally!Raiden was definitely miscast and seemed completely useless at times.Get a better writerGet a better writerDid I say get a better writer twice?

And they decided to have like 5 fights happening at once twice in the second half. None of the villains are fleshed out. Like it's awful. I didn't think you could make the 1995 movie look like high art, but ya did. It feels like act 1 of a story since the boring protagonist decides to reject the call to adventure over halfway through the movie.Now having a whole film be act 1 CAN be good like Unbreakable.But this is not.

1328,d_bellew,"Good,if you're a Mortal Kombat fan",6,27 April 2021,"This movie was a bit hit or miss,some stuff worked really well,others not so much.Alot of reviews complaining about there been no tournament,personally i dont mind that as the plot,for a reboot,was decent.I suppose the issue with casting is finding someone competent enough in martial arts & that can act,not an easy mission so we have some poor acting but some good fight scenes.Of course the scenes between scorpion & sub zero steal the show & are so good they probably make the rest of the action look a shade on the poor side.As many have mentioned there is alot of needless characters thrown into the mix & while i was glad to see some on the big scene there really was no need for them (nataro im looking at you)
One sticking point was the new protagonist Cole.completely unneccessary especially considering the wealth of character options available to the writers,the character was irrelevent & failed to carry the movie like a leading man should.After watching the opening 15 minutes id 100% take an origins story about the lin Kuei & Shirai Ryu clans set back in ancient japan.it would be amazing.",Mortal Kombat

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it definitely impacts the pacing of the film, making some scenes feel unnecessarily added in.The brutal action scenes and certain allusions to the game series; however, were PERFECT for the atmosphere of Mortal Kombat. As a patron of the MK universe, I found myself smirking at the dialogue of the characters and loved the chance to watch some of my favorite moves performed in live action.

The lack of depth in the main characters is kind of missing but this one can be fixed in the upcoming movies. Amazing special FX considering the budget compared to other movies.

He was in the heart on everything. Guys it was an easy and entertaining watch. I can't wait for the sequel now. I am sure it will only get better.It can't be like the 4 hours Justice League movie and give a story for every character. It doesn't have the budget for it. They made the movie to the best of its budget. I don't understand those moaning guys who give it a bad review. It's not an MCU movie or from a comic book for god sake. Its based on a video game for crying out loud. You can make up the story as much as you want with a few twist and turns. This was definitely worth a watch 100%.We have been in a pandemic for over a year now and people still are not satisfied.

1368,adamkgriff,Mortal Kombat Legacy was better,6,26 April 2021,"Movie started well introducing two of the best characters (Sub Zero & Scorpion) origin stories, the fight choreography was strong here. Then the movie jumps forward and makes an attempt at a coherent plot with the villains scheme to kill Earthrealm warriors before the Mortal Kombat tournament. The bland protagonists are then introduced, Cole a descendant of Hanzo Hasashi (Scorpion), Jax, Sonya & Kano who in fairness does get some pretty funny lines. The dialogue is pretty bad otherwise and the acting average not sure if that's poor direction or reflection of the actors abilities. The CGI is pretty well done but in this day and age that should be a minimum standard. The story grinds to halt at the training montage where each character tries to learn there special power, any momentum the movie had at this point fizzles out and it just barely kept my attention. So towards the end we see some nice fatalities and a decent fight scene between the two legends Scorpion & Sub Zero but the ending is poor, they are clearly trying to set up a franchise here and I wouldn't hold my breath for that. At no point in this movie was I given any reason to care about any of these characters, Mortal Kombat Legacy did a far better job of building the characters up. In summary fans of the games like myself will enjoy the gore and there's enough fan service in the movie to keep you just about entertained but as a movie it's average at best.",Mortal Kombat
1369,joris-65674,"Nice quality production, decent story",7,24 April 2021,"The story start very interesting and we are off to a great start of the story.Then we are introduced to the main character, who seems to be in a low of his career as an MMA fighter.IMHO the introduction part of the movie took a little too long because it wasn't really telling us too much background information or character development. There is some action with a fight scene and when sub-zero comes to the surface there is some more action. That scene was quite convincing and clearly put sub-zero in the camp of evil guy. Leaving Jax to die on the floor of an abandoned building.The part between Sonya, Kano, Cole Young and Reptile is a quite entertaining fight scene which ends a little bizarre but still ok. Especially Kano comes up with some cute one-liners and he bring quite the edgy character to the movie.Where the story starts to be lacking is where Sonya, Cole and Kano arrive at the Temple of Rayden, where they are to train for the upcoming 10th Mortal Kombat. I find the acting performance of Rayden not really convincing, while Sub-Zero and Scorpion are really on point.The idea that all human fighters need to find their own special power (arcana) is cool. Particularly how Kano finds his power is very entertaining. Kano is one of the more flavorful characters.It's quite bizar that Jax is also being cared for in the Temple and it's left a mystery to how Liu Kang actually found him, while the temple clearly wasn't near the USA but we'll let that one slip.How Cole Young found his Arcana is a little predictable but it give us a cool fight between him an Goro. I was a little underwhelmed but the execution of his power. The special effects where underwhelming or it was intended for him to have a special latex suite with special effects.I was somewhat novel to have the champions of the earth bring the fight to their adversaries in a tournament style. But for me the fights would have been more interesting is they were drawn out a little longer. The movie lost too much time with the set-up and so the delivery is quite light on the one-on-one fights. Especially how Sony ends up finding her Arcana: she just shows up with her power to finish the fight between Cole Young and Mileena. Quite the anti-climax.The final fight between Cole Young and Sub-Zero becomes really interesting because Scorpion get summoned from Hell to finish off Sub-Zero.This saves the movie somewhat but doesn't really carry it over the lackluster feeling of missing some depth and enough cool fight scenes or signature moves.The movie end by preparing the plot for a sequel, showing us that Cole Young will become Johnny Cage.I the end my 7/10 is quite generous and mostly based on the fact that I just like to see the Mortal Kombat universe be brought to life on the big screen.",Mortal Kombat
1370,lukajeroncic,Surprisingly good!,8,11 April 2021,"From the perspective of a non-MK fan, this was a really enjoyable watch.I approached this movie as a no-brain fighting action movie. Everything that would make such a movie good was performed brilliantly. The fighting was really well performed and directed, with no fast cuts that plauge a lot of bad action movies. There was plenty of fighting, with very little talk in between, which is a plus for this kind of movie. The fighting scenes are not too long and over-dramatic. The special effects are superb and fit flawlessly into the movie. The version I watched is absolutely not censored and that should be the only way to watch it.Characters are mostly bland and shallow, quantity over quality is definitely a theme here. Starting with an uninteresting main character and following the same with some side characters. The important characters do have really good and straight to the point introduction which I appreciate, but could be more fleshed out, at least for the few important ones.The humor is well timed and fits the movie quiet well, which is a great addition to a movie like this.The story is a bit sketchy. Some weird decisions and inconsistencies are noticable but nothing that breaks the movie. A little bit of suppresion is needed though.The movie sets up well for the sequel, which I am definitely going to watch.Finally, as a gamer but not a MK player, I recognized a lot of the characters and caught most of the references to the game, which definitely made the movie more enjoyable. I don't know the story or the lore of the games so I cannot compare to that.Verdict: It is a very enjoyable movie if you're not looking to get too invested in the story. It does it's job brilliantly considering the genre.",Mortal Kombat

The fights were ok, at least the editor wasn't the worst offender in the art of way too many cuts.Also there is Kano, the only character that you are able to remember 15 minutes after the movie is over.Then there is the script, it really doesn't differ much from the original, aside making it dumber and retconnig some minor but rather important things.I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but someone with a touch of talent would find a way to use the lore of the franchise that is almost 30 years old.""Flawless victory, fatality"" Sure anyone that has ever played some MK game will recognize the lines, so obviously they must be forced in to the movie, emphasis on the force. I have no problem with nodding to the fans, but those things should be done subtly.The main character, I really have nothing to say about him.

1382,dwainereyes,The prelude to the tournament,8,26 April 2021,"Critics have a tough job. They have to write reviews on dozens, if not, hundreds of movies; all part of varying genres. The problem with that is they tend to write their reviews based on the same qualities regardless of the genre, and you really can't do that while providing accurate reviews based on the genre.Mortal Kombat is a cinematic action fantasy about legendary martial arts tournaments. It is based on the video game of the same name. Today, it's modern interpretation pays homage to the original movie while also providing new viewers a bit of background to set the stage for what appears to be the beginning of Hollywood's reimagining.The movie itself isn't the Mortal Kombat tournament but rather Shang Tsung's attempt to preempt a victory he'd imagined locked. Unfortunately, this time around, Cole Young is on earths champion list. Being a blood descendant of Scorpion, aka Hasashi Hanzo, he is bestowed great abilities which only needed to be unlocked.Additionally, Raiden, the lightning god, has brought others into the group who also stand on earths side and each must either find their strengths or help others discover their abilities.Many of the same characters return, albeit in name only. Also, expect the final statements of finishing moves to be said as per the game.One of the few things I didn't find well received was the current iteration of Shang Tsung. In my opinion, his adaptation just didn't have the same ""authenticity"" as the original actor who filled the role. The same could be said of the current version of Kung Lao, who seemed to be a bit less focused but instead appeared almost... smug.Overall, the action pretty much maintained good pacing throughout the movie. There were few noticeable interruptions which took away from the momentum.For a movie that is adapted from a video game depicting gore and violence mashed with martial arts and fantasy style fighting, it definitely hit the spot. Especially since the current superhero trope is still in full swing. It's nice to have a change in pace.",Mortal Kombat

Maybe good for a pilot for a web series but the Paul Ws Anderson movie - even with the outdated cgi - is still enjoyable. The story is not good at all, the characters are 2D and they are just often posing where the 95 movie had cool story cool fight scenes- this movie is not even close to the action scenes of the old movie. The special effects are not saving the new movie. As by many movie lately, the trailer is better than the movie itself. I'm sorry as it could have been a great reboot but the acting and the fight scenes are not impressive. It was claimed that the fatalities will be brutal- nope, they are forced. How about giving Paul Ws Anderson budget to complete the old trilogy and re-edit the second part- would have been more sense than this.",Mortal Kombat

1391,georgechavez-68339,Get out of the year 1995 *Edit*,9,24 April 2021,"Stop and leave what came out 26 years ago in the past..Mortal Kombat 95 was probably one the most rented movies for me from the days of blockbuster and Mortal Kombat Annihilation aswell but because it had alot of characters and however the acting was mediocre but still loved it because it was video game movie.Growing up and playing almost every game including MK mythologies of SubZero. I still remember how re watching MK 95 and just feeling like this movie adaptation deserved a 2nd chance i was excited for this new take of Mortal Kombat on the big screen.First 7 mins hooked because it brought aN amazing character's origin story into live action. Instead what MK 95 did not because they were ""partners"".In MK 21 the character Bi-Han (sub-zero)had a more menacing character arc. Which was completely left out in MK 95 along with his mythos. Scorpion by far had the best introduction in the film and they stuck with his character mythos from the game. Jax and Sonya were amazing to see and to actually see them use their special moves unlike MK 95 or MK Annihilation.Kabal was a blast to see and again stuck with the original character structure.KANO had such a good reference to what the original creators of the games felt about him.If you honestly can't appreciate this movie then you need to let go of MK movie from 95. Because honestly it was terrible, from the acting to the fighting choreography and random characters like example the fight scene with the hooded shirtless dudes.I also can't forget Mortal Kombat Conquest I stayed up late at night just to watch it on our local channel.In conclusion...yes this movie had flaws..acting needed improvement but its not terrible. Fighting scenes needed to be longer but we got to finally see some MK gruesome fighting. This Movie delivered what the fans needed I'm sure scenes were taken out and characters were scrape but if you appreciate this movie. A schedule will happen and it can get better.",Mortal Kombat
1392,bstilesbs,Good reboot,8,25 April 2021,"I give this an 8 because I loved mortal kombat as a kid when it first came out and lost touch of it after the 3rd game until number 5 came out and then 11 I played for a minute. I was out of touch for a while on the new characters in the newer games over time which brings me to cole in the movie. I've never heard of him and he was never really and og mk fighter 🤔 so I wonder if I had missed anything over the years but it seems that other fans aren't familiar with him either so that would be the only downfall of the movie. The cgi was good and the fighting choreography could've been a tad better but overall for modern time, much better than the first one in 94 and definitely much better than annihilation, which almost any movie is better than annihilation. I cant wait for the second one and hopefully there will be a third in the future if all goes well. Warner bros definitely helped new line cinema with the little extra cash they may have needed for the budget costs since new line was alone to produce the 94 version. I love mortal kombat though so it'd be hard for me to give this a bad rating since no one epic wanted to reboot it til now.

It was too ""light"", needed to be darker.The scripts were rushed and just didn't flow
.The direction could have been much much better, and the acting was below average.There was no back story for any of the characters, and they all seem to get their special powers really quickly in the space of 5mins.The movie had potential, but should have kept it simple, with less characters, more backstory and build up.I would be surprised if its nominated for any award.

They brought in characters from multiple generations (no spoilers)It is a 10 because it checked a vast majority of the boxes for fans, which is what matters.If someone rated it below a 6, they are clearly not fans of Mortal Kombat, and should probably just stick to non video game movies.The casting grew on me slowly throughout the movie, and I really wish the movie was longer.Definitely give this movie a chance, it is entertaining and I feel like it will hold up much better than the original.",Mortal Kombat

The rest of the film, rubbish.Its mentioned a number of times in the film that Mortal Kombat is a ""Tournament"", which the director obviously forgot to film because there was no tournament, basically just random fighting, in random locations, for no apparent reason.And what is the deal with Cole, who's idea was it to make him the lead character.I can't even continue with this review because apart from a few short good moments, the entire film is just messy.Basically do you remember the Street Fighter movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme? - well this is worse.",Mortal Kombat

1406,Danielrl1982,Awesome Trailers... Mediocre Movie,4,24 April 2021,"Gee. It pains me to write this review. I had such high expectations for this movie.A solid and established video game. A history in film from which to learn. Modern visual effects. And Hiroyuki Sanada in the role of Scorpion. They had everything to make a great film.Opinion on Plot (No spoilers):
I honestly don't know where to start. The plot is ok...ish I guess. I personally don't mind movies sticking to the well known and established history from video games but I understand Hollywood feeling the need to change a plot and a story and introduce character nobody really wants just because... because I don't know why. I guess the director and writters are just so full of themsleves they want their personal touch in everything. Cole makes no sense at all. That's all I'll say to avoid spoilers, but there is nothing special about this guy and there is really nothing that makes him a unique or irreplaceable character in the Movie. We were all waiting for the Mortal Kombat tournament and it didn't even happen! Like... c'mon, guys!Acting:
Acting is terrible. Except for perhaps Sanada and Taslim, the rest of the cast just felt weird... fake. Save for the ninjas and perhaps Kano and MAYBE Jax, the rest just felt off their characters. At some point I even felt they were uncomfortable doing it specially the guys playing Liu Kang, Raiden and Kung Pao (great joke by the way). I won't even talk about Reptile. Goro's participation in this movie is essentially non existent.Fan service:
We all wanted some fan service, but I think this movie picked the most cringy way to deliver what I consider an forced amount of fan service (specially catch phrases).Concept:
At first I thought they were going to keep a balanced amoutn of realism and fantasy and they didn't they went for full fantasy. Which is ok, but they in the end what they chose to put on the fantasy side, looked kind of ridiculous. There a very serious lack of consistency on the brute strength of the characters. Kabal is very fast at first, and then he gets tired (I guess) cause out of nowhere he becomes slow enough to take a hit. Goro is super strong that he destroyed a vehicle, but apparently he loses his strength when he hits an oponent he's grabbed. Out of nowhere Cole understand old Japanese from the 17th Century. Again, inconsistent.Screen time (agh!) - Some minor spoilers (may be):
I know, I know. It is impossible to give enough screen time for all characters of the franchise. But precisely because of that reason, why the heck would you include irrelevant characters that add absolutely no value to the plot and waste screen time that could have been used to expand perhaps on, gee I don't know: ""some back stories besides Sub-Zero and Scorpion's rivalry?!!!"" Nitara? Reiko? But... no Johnny Cage? Characters that didn't appear until Shinnok returned, now didn't even make it to the first tournament alive?! Goro went down just like that? Some times less is more. Unfortunatelly this movie just didn't get it.Conclusion
The ninjas truly are so cool, that they just barely save the movie from a total disaster. Their scenes were not perfectly written, but they were good enough. The bad thing is that you'll find everything good about this move in the trailers and the 7 minute preview you can find in YouTube. I think that the premise of a movie with modern visual effects and based on Scorpion and Sub-Zero's rivalry is way more appealing than the 1995 concept. BUT! And I know this will rise some eyeborws... I think that however imperfect the 1995 movie was, it is way more consistent than this one:
Better plot: 1995
Better character balance: 1995
Better choreography: 2021
Better visual effects: 2021 no doubt
Better acting: 1995 (by a lot)Is it a total waste, not if you have HBO Max already. If you will pay extra to watch this, I'd wait for it to be available in Netflix or Prime Video.",Mortal Kombat
1407,furfilm,"Not bad, but ...",7,7 May 2021,"As a fan of classic videogames, I am somewhat disappointed.Despite all the references that can excite you, the movie feels a bit lazy. Maybe it's the absence of Jhonny Cage, the little respect they gave to Goro, how boring Raiden or the protagonist Cole Young, but it didn't feel better than the one from 95.Goro went from being the Mortal Kombat champion and Prince Shao Khan to a Warcraft orc.Raiden does nothing.Liu Kang's special attack looks so bad that he seems to walk on top of the enemy rather than kick him.It is not bad, it has many memorable and exciting moments but it is somewhat weak in its fidelity to the game.",Mortal Kombat

I guess it doesn't matter at the end of the day, Mortal Kombat is still the best video game movie of all-time, haters or not, there's nothing they can do about it but defame it the best way they can, with bad taste and clueless ratings and reviews by people who know nothing about Mortal Kombat.

1412,misterbeapjr,Cool Fighting Movie,7,25 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat (2021) doesn't try to be anything more than a fun movie about a video game where people fight each other to the death. The combat looks amazing with special effects used to enhance the movements of the actors, and the writers included plenty of jokes about the games and the brutality of it all. The movie does suffer by having too many characters as no one really gets the attention they deserve.The main character Cole Young is a bit boring, Sonya and Jax could've used more screen time, and characters like Mileena and Goro are just there to fight people. Kano, Scorpion, and Sub-Zero are the only characters that felt complete, which is great because those three are the best characters in the movie. Kano steals every scene he is in, Sub-Zero fills the menacing antagonist role brilliantly, and Scorpion provides a great foil to Sub-Zero. There's also 9 other characters not mentioned here. All of them fit in one of the above categories. Nevertheless, Seeing the same 5 characters fight each other would get boring, so the large cast does keep the fights visually interesting.",Mortal Kombat

Second issue was how stupid and over the top kano's character was! Out of all the potential actors that could have done him justice they had to use this guy who literally just looks like an outback crocodile hunter with zero fighting talent and in my opinion killed the character by not adding in his well known and famous eye of steel.. instead we get a bloody red dot behind a scar ( pathetic ). And not to mention the depressive Liu Kang who I think would've been better off in a romantic film! Why is it so difficult to choose actors that actually fit the character!! Like Michael Jai white - jax
Scott Adkins - Kano etc.Creators take note of the way rebirth and legacy was created and maybe you might get much better reviews.. almost 20 yrs waiting for a freakin try hard comedy and I'm sorry to say James Wan but you fukt it on this one!! Want an amazing movie with scores above 8.1.. then take the advice and take note of the reviews!!!!Problem is that that the creators of it were obviously not real fans.

1429,worksalexander,It rides a thin line,5,24 April 2021,"It's not outright terrible, but it absolutely sits on thin ice that even Sub-Zero can't help them with.The first major problem is that they tried to invent their own MC, which meant adjusting characters around him, giving him additional supporting characters, and basically brute forcing this character no one asked for into the MK storyline. DId they write a new story line for this? No, they just butchered the actual MK plotline to make it happen.Some character costumes are done well, as with the CGI; however as soon as it comes to portraying the characters themselves, other than maybe Kano, they are all dull and lifeless. Including the villains.The story is loaded with holes, major errors with the characters, and bad dialogue. When I say bad dialogue, I mean not even cheesy good like the original Mortal Kombat film, but just outright cringe and nonsensical.The saving grace of this film, is it's Kombat scenes, and the occasional nod to the games that spawned it's existence. When there is fighting, for the most part it becomes an enjoyable experience that rings true to the source material it's using.The movie ends off the assumption it would have a part II....but we'll see.",Mortal Kombat

The predictable plot, the subpar twists, the not so flashy special affects and computer animation. I just don't think there's any excuse for this not to have blown our socks off.

However, the film sometimes dives a lot into dialogues that leave the film boring and dull to watch.

It almost seems like this is a prequel/set-up movie, and if it does well, maybe they will expand more. The acting was pretty well, but some lines felt forced a bit. There wasn't that big ""grab you"" moment and I believe that is because Cole isn't relatable to people who have history with the MK Universe. Nonetheless, a fun action flick that does pay homage to some of the characters we know so well.",Mortal Kombat
1440,evanjaruzel,It's just really fun,8,29 April 2021,I see so many people say that this movie is bad because of dumb reasons. Somebody said that it was bad because instead of using a puppet for gorgo like the original it would be better and that's just dumb. Just because a movie did cgi doesn't mean it's bad. Stop comparing it to the original there different movies with the same brand and some of the same characters. I would say this movie is better than the original I'm not saying the original is bad but I just liked it more. I just have three problems.One there are a lot of characters. Yes it's cool for fans of mortal kombat but it's kind of annoying. Two there's no Johnny cage. Why is there no Johnny cage yes they mentioned him at the end but they could of just made him the main character. Three the main character. Why is cole not Johnny cage they try to make him like Johnny cage but he's just not Johnny cage.I would say watch it and make sure you don't think it's going to be like the original because it's a different movie.,Mortal Kombat

1448,floatingnuke,Its not that good,5,4 June 2021,"The story is bad, but the fight scenes are ok. Its not really worth watching if your not a mortal kombat fan. A problem with the movie is that when kung lao dies and gets his soul sucked, it's obvious that its gonna happen but kabal says he's gonna get his soul sucked, basically stating the obvious.

The effort put in and what they were able to do with a median budget ( Thanks WB 😕) was incredible!! Here's to whatever it takes to keep the tournaments appearing on the big screen!",Mortal Kombat
1454,nathannannenga,This movie gave me a profound respect for the 1995 version.,4,23 April 2021,"Don't get me wrong, I didn't have extremely high expectations for this, but it would have been so easy to knock it out of the park.Plot: Why the baffling decision to have all the plot happen outside the titular tournament? It should have been such an easy win for the plot here.Characters: First off, where the **** is my boy Johnny Cage? Honestly, I actually appreciated that they attempted to adapt faithfully many of the characters costumes and abilities from the game, which makes the introduction of main character Cole Young and the callous disregard for the lore so.... dumb. Why be faithful in one regard, but not another? I would have been pumped to have Cole Young turn out to be the younger brother or descendent of Subzero, like so many of us speculated was to be the outcome based on the trailers. But the decision to have him be the descendent of Scoprion, and an entirely new character to the roster, feels so.... unnecessary and disappointing. Again.... why? The issue is exasperated by the fact that Cole Young is completely dwarfed by the charisma and personality of Kano in every scene they're in together (which is most of them).Castings: Actually pretty good!Pacing: Started out great in the first half, with an intriguing introduction to the rivalry between Scoprion and Subzero. Second half felt extremely rushed, with many of the roster killed off, including a much too quick introduction and death for the iconic character Goro.Fun factor: I was excited and entertained in the beginning, until I realized where all this was headed. The fights were enjoyable and fun to watch, though. The abilities and moves were faithful and awesome on screen, and the over-the-top gore was there. Costumes were good. Background scenes and settings were, unfortunately, forgettable. Also, -10 points for a super weak ""Get over here"".How I would make it better:
Make the tournament the central plot point. Let there be more focus on individual fights in the tournament so we can enjoy some good ol' martial arts.Remove Cole Young altogether, or have him be the next Subzero, and not metal skin dudeMake Liu Kang the main characterJohnny CageMake Goro more ominous and threatening and not just a plot device for ColeGet rid of the unnecessary dragon tattoo birthmark power explanation thingNarrow the roster down and focus on the character development of the core castUse the ""get over here!"" straight from the gameif you're still hellbent on having this be a prologue to the tournament, scrap this entire movie and just focus on the Scorpion/Subzero backstory, because that had such potential.",Mortal Kombat
1455,danydarko-34609,Did I watch the same film as these guys saying it's 10/10??!?,2,24 April 2021,"I grew up with the original games and films,they were all fun(annihilation is c#*p but had a few good fights). I grew up on Bruce lee,Jackie Chan,Van Damme,etc films also so I'm a huge martial arts fan. Naturally films like this(about a supernatural fight tournament) should have my face hurting from grinning too much.....it REALLY didn't! I hate to report that this really is a HUGE let down! This is another case of ALL the best bits ARE in the trailer. The first 20 mins is pretty good,the first 10 mins are especially great! But it goes down hill FAST. The main character Cole is by far one of the LAMEST characters ever put in a film,zero likability,yet he's the main character?!!That in itself is insulting to the legendary characters of MK mythology. The fights are pretty boring apart from a few exceptions(basically fights with sub-zero and scorpion). The story,there really isn't one,I know this is a fight film but cmon at least try! There is no real build up to any fights,people just start fighting randomly and some are laughable! There is NO TOURNAMENT?!?NO JOHNNY CAGE?!?RAIDEN DOES NOTHING?!?Yet there are people claiming this is EXACTLY what MK fans want???! Dont be fooled,the less hyped you are for this film the more chance you have of liking any of it. The idea of the Cole Character was the worst idea ever,I still can't get over some of the DUMB moments with his character! No character development,he's boring and obvious at the start(I guessed exactly what would happen with him as it's painfully obvious) and just gets more annoying throughout. I won't give any spoilers just don't get excited for this film and maybe you'll enjoy some of it? One last thing,the 1995 film IS actually a more entertaining film. If you want a real fighting tournament film go watch Enter the Dragon or Bloodsport. Trust me I wanted to love this film,but the truth must be told,it's a waste of time and money and probably won't get a sequel due to how unprofessionally this was made. The script should NEVER have been green lit! Hell even a remake of the original film would've been better! Sorry to say REAL martial arts fans will see through this smoke screen of fancy effects and gore and see it's another wasted opportunity. Donnie Yen as Liu Kang, Scott Adkins as Johnny Cage and Jackie Chan as Raiden...already that's a better idea for a MK film. Last thing,it is SHAMEFUL what happens to the legendary Goro in this lame movie.",Mortal Kombat

The cinematography is also on a different level.

This whatever Cole guy was suppose to be a protagonist but as an actor he fails flawlessly. Jax was promising, Sonya can do better she lacks wit as the game version of Sonya Blade is out of the world character.

Costumes and special effects are actually done pretty well and enjoyable.This movie isn't faithful to the games at all. Firstly, the main character, Cole Young, is a completely new character. Personally, I don't mind if the plot is somewhat changed and new characters are added, but this guy seems very random to me. It just doesn't tie in with Mortal Kombat lore at all.Secondly, the plot in general seems badly written and cringy. While it's cool that they added lines from the game, the execution was just unnatural. There are many plot holes as well, and while some can be ignored, a lot of them are just too big and essential to the plot. This problem is probably one of the worst I've seen, as throughout the entire movie I was only thinking about the plot holes.This movie is probably meant for someone who's never interacted with Mortal Kombat, so it's understandable that some elements have to be removed and some added to make it enjoyable for the viewer, but also appeal to the games' fans.

1471,rob_picken,I never thought it was possible to sink any lower than Mortal Kombat Annihilation,5,23 April 2021,"To quote Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park: ""He did it, the crazy son of a.. he did it"".The Mortal Kombat series has had a rocky relationship with our tv and movie screens, from the fantastic 1995 movie staring Christopher Lambert.. to the frankly abysmal 1997 sequel Mortal Kombat Annihilation film that was so bad that it killed off the series for a long time.So when they first announced they were reviving the franchise I for one was genuinely surprised, aside from the Mortal Kombat mini series by Kevin Tancharoen we've not had anything Mortal Kombat movie related for years. So once the Twitter tease dropped and the hype built up yes naturally I was suckered in being a long time Mortal Kombat videogame player... boy was I let down.Now look.. I'm sure there's going to be those of you who liked the movie was what it is, but this is not a movie for the die hard Mortal Kombat fans. I mean let's just address the obvious elephant in the room: no Johnny Cage? Seriously? You can add Nitara (who's one of the less known characters in the series) but you can't have a corner stone of the MK franchise because the director doesn't like the idea of a white male lead? That's insane.Now that's out the way, keeping on the topic of characters we have this new guy called Cole who literally NOBODY asked for. I get that MK adds new characters to the roster every game, but this is a movie and honestly? I hated his character.Now that gripe is out the way I can talk about the rest f the film. Honestly it felt kind of boring.. the outworld section was a complete let down, and I never thought I'd see the day when Annihilation did a better job of Outworld than 2021. The editing in this movie is horrendous, and you're constantly chopping back and forth it got really annoying after a while.Obviously I can't say to much because of spoilers, but really.. if you're just a casual cinema goer who wants something to watch with your popcorn then great fill your boots.. but those of you hardcore Mortal Kombat fans, this isn't for you so just stick to the games.",Mortal Kombat

Bronze armor lame too.Positive: MMA fight in beginning was good. Special effects are perfect. Lightnings, blood, violence, it's what we all like.

It really just looks and feels like an enthusiastic amateur effort by cosplayers with some very inconsistent effects thrown on in post.The few halfway decent fight scenes in here weren't worth sitting through the majority of the movie which was just a lot of bad acting, juvenile attempts at being ultra grim dark and edgy yet at the same time shoving cringey out of place game quotes and unfunny comic relief Kano in there, and unreal engine looking particle effects.",Mortal Kombat

1484,rexstone2010,A Shaky Yet Potentially Promising Start to a Franchise,6,2 November 2021,"This film delivers tremendous fan service with very detailed yet subtle references and includes characters both prominent and obscure in the Mortal Kombat world. The CGI compliments an absolutely stellar costume and design department that completely did the film justice in execution.However the writing and film itself is a struggle. There are some tremendously cringeworthy acting performances from Lu Kang and the newly added Cole Young. Frankly the two most important characters in the film yet you want to do everything possible to get through their scenes. Kabal, Goro, and Kano absolutely stole the show with tremendous originality that remained true to how fans wanted these characters portrayed on the big screen. Additionally, some absolutely massive characters that are integral in the series are killed off immediately with little effort, leaving the diehards wondering how they expect to carry on the story without such figures. I would imagine it would involve resurrection coming in the form of Shang Tsung.I hope the Mortal Kombat fans get the films they have been crying out for, but I wouldn't be surprised if this film killed the momentum from the start.",Mortal Kombat

Adding ""Arcana"" as a way of explaining why the hero characters have superpowers is an interesting idea, but IMO it isn't properly explained or utilised- it's just a mcguffin to give certain characters their in-game abilities.Not quite as good as the first Mortal Kombat, but certainly better than Annihilation.",Mortal Kombat

I would have preferred the aforementioned game storyline in all it's absurdity (""we must navigate this crisis by aiding him"" - Raiden) as opposed to something new. For some silly reason I felt more for the characters in that storyline than this one. However, I must admit the best interactions were between Sub Zero and Scorpion, not to mention Kano and Kabal. Mileena was a wasted opportunity as she should have been the crazy ""Harlequin"" of the movie. The ending felt a bit rushed.Having said this, I feel this movie needs a sequel and the characters deserve a chance to grow.

Its as basic and straightforward as it gets, but done well. This is a movie about fighting so there is no need for anything complicated regarding the plot. Fighting scenes are great, special effects look nice and you get some iconic MK characters doing iconic MK moves. It is what Mortal Kombat movie should be. I think fans of the game will enjoy it and people who like fighting movies should enjoy it.If there are sequels (and I hope there will be) they should be done the way this movie was done. They have got material to work with, this movie sets up posssible continuation of a story, and games have introduced plenty of characters so there should be no problems making a simple, yet effective story like they did here.

Well firstly it's not an oscar reaching drama so for acting - acting was fine, all characters were in their style and some even better than expected.The movie has plenty of action but you gotta keep in mind that it's clearly made to be continued soon, so this film gives a nice welcome to MK world.

1513,jay_jeed,"Possibly the worst ""mainstream""-movie of 2021",2,24 April 2021,"I don't know where to begin honestly. The acting was about the worst I've seen in a long while. As soon as I saw an actor from Supergirl was starring, I knew exactly what to expect.. and I was totally right. Cringeworthy lines that only a really drunk person could maybe find it funny or...cool. I have no idea how people can rate it so high, maybe our viral plague has numbed peoples mind completely. The fights coordination is lackluster and could be so much more intense and nail-biting. I have never seen such bored out movements and slow fighting in an action movie for so many years.The only real positive argument I can give is that the movie do have some gore fatalities.. but it's just not enough to compensate for the lackluster movie overall. If they do decide to make another movie, they got to take a deep breath and actually TRY to make a meaningful story and something that makes sense to the tournament. Even if this is a prequel to the tournament, I never actually felt it gave any sort of leadup to it. Sorry, but I would have rather watched the 1995 version again over this. And please for all that is holy... make the characters STOP saying out loud ""fatality"" and such, I wanted to smash my head with a brick for how cringeworthy it sounded like.",Mortal Kombat

1518,AlyciaDebnamCarey,Disappointing but not surprising.,5,25 April 2021,"I won't say too much about the film as I'm not one for writing spoilers or telling someone what they should think about a film but I personally did not care for the movie too much. As a life long fan of Mortal Kombat and someone that actively plays every single game, the movie just wasn't that good. Some of the acting is not on par with other acting in the movie, the choreography for the fights isn't that great (which is disappointing considering they got Joe Taslim as Sub-Zero), and a lot of the characters are not true to their origin.It is funny because I said long before anyone was cast in the movie that I wanted Ludi Lin as Liu Kang and Joe Taslim as Sub-Zero and both ended up happening. All four of my favourite characters are in the movie too; Kung Lao, Scorpion, Reptile, and Mileena. Most of them barely get any screen time though and the choice for Mileena was awful. Mileena is my all time favourite character from any verse and so I was pretty much instantly disappointed when I saw who was cast as her a whilst back. She looks nothing like Mileena, not to mention, they did the typical ""let's alter her skin colour to please people"" thing, and they kept from showing her Tarkatan look throughout the entire film minus one scene.Mileena is the clone and twin to Kitana; Kitana, whilst of the fictional Edenian culture, is based on the Chinese culture and was originally supposed to be Shang Tsung's daughter. Shang Tsung is also Chinese and so this means that Mileena is based on a Chinese origin. The only thing different about Mileena in terms of her appearance is that she has Tarkatan blood in her and this gives her the Tarkartan mouth/teeth. One of the most annoying things is people with no knowledge of MK that try and defend changes to Mileena or any other character.I'm aware that the actress for Mileena in this film is part Asian too, though I have no idea of which origin though this is beside the point as she simply looks nothing like what Mileena is supposed to. Joe Taslim is a good example of how to properly cast a role. He is Indonesian but of Chinese descent and looks exactly like what Sub-Zero is supposed to. The same can be said for Kano and many other people in the movie that were properly cast. Imagine Jax being cast as a guy with light skin or Kano being cast as someone that isn't Australian; it literally breaks all immersion of the character for people that actually love these characters.I will add though that there are some exceptions to this from time-to-time such as Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, a Japanese actor that played Shang Tsung in the original Mortal Kombat movie. He did a great job in the movie and really made Shang Tsung into what most imagine him as.With all of that said, there was one really good part about the movie and that was Kano. Kano acted just as he should and the guy that played him, Josh Lawson, did a really good job.",Mortal Kombat

The arch of training takes literally two days in the movie in a lame ass temple.Second problem: the characters are way too dumb. They have to discover their arcana that comes from the soul. Ok. Kano gets his laser when he gets pissed in a child discussion (THE LASER COMES OUT OF HIS EYES. Disgust*), Jax just get stronger robot arms and Sonya gets the magic version of her arm guns in the game (disgust*). Raiden is straight up useless, BUT he can teleport anyone he wants in the movie, even the bad guys (WTF). The villains are pathetic and incompetent, Shang Tsung basically does nothing in the whole movie and the other bad guys are just... guys.Third problem: COLE. Jeez, what a bad character. They wanted him to introduce the viewer in the universe, but they do that in a scene that could literally have any other character. He gets beaten up by a regular fighter in the beginning of the movie and then, literally 3 days later, he is killing a stupid and horrible CGI Goro with his black panther-like armor that came from his arcana. In the final fight with Sub-Zero instead of fighting with him and help Scorpion, HE KEEPS BEATING UP THE ICE THAT SUB-ZERO USED TO CAPTURE HIS FAMILY. By the way, WHY HE DIDN'T KILL COLE'S FAMILY LIKE HE DID WITH SCORPION? OH YEAH, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE PROTAGONIST'S FAMILY.Fourth problem: Scenarios. Jesus, what a crap-ass movie for scenarios. The most Mortal Kombat scenario that appears is the throne of Shang Tsung, because in the rest of the movie they keep fighting in TRAILERS, A LITERAL FIGHT RING and that stupid Raiden's temple.

The plot is like a CSI Boston TV show...there is zero magic in it...the actors are bad and sterile...the final match is in the same cage of the beginning( in my opinion it should have started with a huge fight between scorpion and subzero with full fatalities and epic music...)...not even anything related to mortal kombat themes and arenas...how can anyone make a mortal kombat movie where normies and women need to kinda like it ?

1529,gussgrimm,Should have been a TV show instead.,4,25 April 2021,"The opening sequence was pretty decent. Sub Zero is by far the best handled character in this movie. He felt like a force to be reckoned with. I wish the movie had focused more on him.Shang Tsung is one of my favorite MK characters and I wish they had left him out of this. His presence was so underwhelming. He doesn't do anything relevant to the plot. And honestly the actor plays him so wooden. Shang Tsung is teeming with personality and cunning. None of that was displayed here.Liu Kang was painful to watch. He is the franchise's main character and they wasted him as some boring generic side character. The actor looked the part, but didn't feel like the character at all. He was just some dude with a familiar name. In my opinion, worst handled character. Also if they weren't gonna use the main protagonist of the franchise as the main, they should have gone with Scorpion instead.That brings me to Cole. Ugh. Why did they do that? With a plethora of characters to choose from they decided to create the most generic protagonist possible. The only thing he has going for him is being Scorpion's descendant..... just give me scorpion then, and get this boring dude out of my face!Kano on the other hand, not boring. Probably the best character in the movie in terms of personality. However, and this might be unpopular opinion, something about him didn't quite feel like Kano. Maybe it was how lighthearted they actually went with him. I'm used to Kano being this monster that does horrible things and then has a good laugh while he's at it. Kano felt more like what Johnny Cage should be. But that is nitpicking. I can live with the Kano they gave us here. The actor was pretty good for the part too.Raiden was horrible. I like the actor that plays him but honestly feel he was wrong for this part. Raiden had no presence in this movie. Didn't like him at all. And the glowing eye effects looked so bad. I don't understand how those were approved.Sonya and Jax were pretty decent. Kung Lao was the best of them. The actor looked the part. The fighting style resembled exactly the game fighting style of Lao. I was happy with that, but ultimately the character was wasted and underused. Again, if Liu Kang were to be protagonist, Kung Lao should have been his right hand.Goro, Nitara, Reiko and Mileena were all wasted. Everything felt so rushed with them. Reptile? Almost forgot about him. They did all of them dirty. Which brings me to my main point.This movie should have been a tv series instead. (With a higher budget ideally) the first season could have focused on Sub Zero as the main villain and after that they can start introducing the bigger guys like Shang Tsung, Quan Chi and eventually Shao Kahn. There's too many characters and storylines for a single movie. Or even a trilogy. This movie was soooo rushed and it felt like things were just happening. It felt disjointed. The character motivations weak. All because they had to cram tons of characters and stories in a single movie.All in all. Pretty mediocre movie. Cole was just as bad as I imagined he would be. This movie suffers from a lot of mishandling and rushing and while it has its merits and you can certainly see they treated certain aspects of it well, too many other things bring it down to mediocrity.

I agree with the other reviewers, there is room for better and as the movie ended maybe they will continue. However, I must say I enjoyed this a lot better than the other ones, which I watched because of the game, but got dissapointed.There is gore in the movie, maybe they will release also an unrated version where the finish moves are ever gorier but on the overall this is a good attempt.I gave it a nine because of its quality compared to the other installments and I recommend this one as a fun way to spend two hours in watching something nice.

1538,themistocleskonstantinou,Soulless and uninspired.,5,27 April 2021,"I'm a big fan of the MK video games so naturally my expectations were high. I ""wanted to believe"". I understand that the budget was limited and I appreciate the decent cgi and the way the gore and fatalities were executed. The problem is that they tried so hard with the visual aspect of the film and they forgot to give the characters soul. Each and everyone was forgettable. Except Scorpion and Sub-zero. Well, Kano too wasn't forgettable but in a bad way in my opinion. His jokes were ok. But the thing is that in this movie there shouldn't be any. I guess they tried to make a Marvel type of movie. Action comedy or something. I too like Marvel movies but I didn't want to see a copy of this formula here. I would prefer a darker, scarier and more serious type of film. Because in order for the viewer to immerse in a movie, the R-Rated visualization is not enough. You also need to create tense between characters and give each encounter the appropriate drama. It's psychological too. The first 10' were exactly like that and that is why in my opinion this was the best part of the movie. Now as for the acting i won't judge the actors. They were chosen by someone who thought they were good. So if we have to blame someone about the acting there you have it. Fight scenes were not shown in a good way, except Scorpion vs Sub-Zero. Too fast at times and cut/edited in small parts so you can't understand what's really happening. They tried to show so many things at the same time at the end of the movie, that they lost it. It's as if they were in a hurry to finish the movie. It should be simpler. Two characters at a time, fighting and giving each one of them the time to do their thing. Not 10 people fighting at the same time with 1' on screen for each one. And last but not least, the theme song.... Whoever reimagined it in this way, I only have to say this.""I don't think so...

It felt flat a lot and then the action was too much but some of it made me want to train again and I kept waiting to get excited about fight scenes, some of which were amazing.

It's too easy to look for flaws, but that ultimately make someone a downer/negative person (hint, don't be that guy). - This movie was plenty enjoyable, setting itself up as a pseudo-super hero movie, with some Guardians of the Galaxy style alien enemy world building, humor, and a slew of baddies and goodies to take as they are. The humor and riffs were more balanced than cheesy, and were timed pretty well for breaks between martial arts action. At times it's very gore-y, yet somehow not intentionally cheesy nor serious. The opening sequence is quite impressive, with some pretty solid ice crystal CGI work throughout the film. Some will claim the movie had poor CGI due to the 4-armed baddy from the trailer, but even he isn't the worst you could encounter, credit is due to the other effects being plenty acceptable for 2021. (Heck, they got the lighting matched to the world, not even Jurassic World accomplished that! - blue-tinted raptors, look it up) The main character's lines are a bit stale, but he's fine, I wouldn't blame the actor. The supporting cast was surprisingly well suited for their roles and delivered lines well. All-in-all, very enjoyable, undoubtedly not for everyone, but this will be a major cult-film in the future.

As everyone knows, they introduce a new character and he is fine, his character isn't bad, but he shouldn't have been the main focus. This movie feels more like a Cole Young movie with Mortal Kombat characters sorinkled in instead of a Mortal Kombat movie. I think it would have worked better if the original characters were the main focus and Cole was a support character that would take up the mantle as a main character in sequels. Biggest crime that causes folks to shy away from him is his killing of the Outworls Champion Goro. Especially after losing every fight he'd been in in the movie up to that point.

The movie itself was not bad, the only noticeable bad thing of the movie is amateur dialogue, and parts of the story missing!Let's start with the bad. The movie starts out excellent foreshadowing Scorpion's story as Hanzo Hasashi which is his former self but doesn't really show him the rest of the movie until the very end!Second bad, the story... A good movie has to have some value in the story, this movie really focused on the story of Cole Young! Hardly anything else..Let me explain the missing parts of the story... the story starts with Scorpion, in his former self as Hanzo Hasashi (In 1617 AD) reminds me a lot of the animated story of Scorpions Revenge with slight differences. Scorpion's wife and Daughter die, Scorpion gets mad, tries to kill Bi-Han (Sub-Zero) but fails and dies, Raiden shows up, finds Hanzo's last living bloodline and takes him. (Cuts to what I assume is more modern times UFC) Foreshadows Cole Young! We have no idea what happened with the rest of Scorpion's story or the child Raiden rescued! Until the end, Raiden Tells Cole he is the child he rescued in 1617? Huh? 400 years? What happened in 400 years?Let's focus on the good!Cole Young, great character, by far best character development in the movie, I'm excited to see him in future games.Great fights! Excellent choreography and GORE!! That was one of the biggest requests of the developers was to match the gore, with the games, which it did deliver!Great casting of characters, although I would've like to go more into the stories of other characters, but still great casting of characters.Best of all in the movie, the concluding fight!!!!! Omg the ultimate showdown between the two ninja, and at last Scorpion gets his revenge!The summary of my review, Overall great movie! Lacks a little of story, action is wonderful! My favorite Sub-Zero really took the spotlight in this movie as a ice-bending bada$$, could have focused more on Scorpion but if there is a sequel or a prequel hopefully Scorpion shows up more often, Acting was okay, but sub-par at best. Kano is one of the best characters in the movie, they really focused on his character as the biggest A Hole in all of earth realm and his jokes were the comedy relief of the movie.",Mortal Kombat

1577,obliqueskeptic,Mortal Kombat (2021) by Simon McQuoid,5,28 April 2021,"""Spare him, my lord Raiden. American life has enfeebled his mind. Too much television.""In 1995, Paul W. S. Anderson directed Mortal Kombat. For some, it was and remained one of the best worst movies ever made. For many, it stays the greatest film adaptation of an arcade videogame. Whichever way you lean toward, you'll either encounter the words ""best"" or ""greatest"". Today, looking back, the '95 movie would encapsulate the pulpy action and cheesy dialogue that defined a certain space in the 90s. And most of all, 90s nostalgia.Subjectively, is Simon McQuoid's film any better? Not really, but a comparison between the two would be fallacious. But is his film any different? Unfortunately, no. If we're talking about CG violence and ""fatality"" gore, then yes, obviously it's a different film, but in essence it's not. McQuoid's film is pulpy action and cheesy dialogue. It's a rehash of the '95 film sans the nostalgia.Why do I repeat nostalgia? Because some times, that feeling takes a film further. Especially if an original movie formed an integral part of an era. For example, Colin Trevorrow made Jurassic World in 2015. It was basically a different film, but there were several throwbacks to the '93 film. And Trevorrow's Jurassic World was oozing with nostalgia.Mortal Kombat 2021 has poorly choreographed fight scenes. After the class act depicted in the opening sequence surrounding the character of Hanzo Hasashi, every fight scene that follows, is pulpy. In fact, as the movie progresses, the fight sequences dwindle in duration and worsen in quality. And in terms of CG gore, certainly we've seen better and more ingenious violence in the 2019 console game.The 2010 short Mortal Kombat: Rebirth by Kevin Tancharoen was a brilliant endeavour. Personally, I was passionate to see that expand into something special. But that wasn't meant to be.For many, Mortal Kombat 2021 might be faithful to the game. But I feel, other than a few key fatality signature moves, this film deviates greatly from the game. Neither does it respect the game lore, nor does it attempt at changing it at its heart, like Rebirth. So ineffective at most, this film straddles a spot somewhere in between.Simon McQuoid's determination is commendable, but the product seems to be something better off as a web series than a feature film.",Mortal Kombat

Yes they were cheesy but they did the video games justice and paid respsect to them.The main issue I have with this is that they invented a new character to act as the main protagonist for no valid reason. They implied something about them all the way through but the payback wasn't there and it felt half-assed and missed.This looks visually stunning and it a massive leap on the original but the story lacks which is a shame.

1585,spiderman-55910,For Better and Worse,7,23 April 2021,"*******SPOILERS AHEAD*******Perhaps my expectations for this movie were a bit high. Some better casting (at least the Asian god of thunder and lightning was played by an Asian actor), but while many of the actors looked the part, their inexperience also showed. The blood and gore matches that of the games for the first time ever, which will please a lot of fans, but here's the biggest letdown... aside from the final confrontation between Scorpion and Sub-Zero, the 1995 film had better fight choreography. Has Hollywood learned nothing from Hong Kong cinema? I've seen a few Joe Taslim films... he was mostly subdued by comparison here. Good fight scenes should have wider frames, and fewer cuts. Most of the fights in this movie contained moves that any able-bodied person could pull off with how close and how often the angles change. This film was rife with missed opportunities.The transitions between serious movie and fantasy is also off-putting. It would've been nice for this to actually have a tournament plot line, rather than a skirmish outside of one. The awkward, fan-service quotes could've been applied much better this way too. The ""Arcana"" explanation for special abilities is a bit midichlorian-esque, and unnecessary, as fans of the game would already look past that. The ""chosen"" could've been so BECAUSE of their innate abilities.Now for the redeeming parts: Hiroyuki Sanada and Joe Taslim as Scorpion and Sub-Zero were excellent. By far, the best scenes in the movie belong to them. They got Goro right, and Jax, Sonya, and Kano were decent as well. The scene-setting/storytelling is inconsistent, but fun when it lands. And this is still an enjoyable watch overall.If this lays the groundwork for sequels, then I may be judging too harshly. I'm just a longtime fan of the games, lore, and characters. While the story could've been better, I'm mostly disappointed by the lackluster fight scenes, because those are what we're really in it for. My rating is on the backs of Hiroyuki and Joe for their outstanding performances.",Mortal Kombat

I liked the way they explained how the characters have their superhuman powers. The action is exactly what you come to see. The blood, the gore. It doesn't shy away from showing any of it. And there plenty of references and fun things from the games to see. From the characters themselves, to the iconically brutal fatalities and the infamous phrases from the games. Hiroyuki Sanada's deliverance of Scorpion's ""get over here!"" does not disappoint. The movie even pokes fun at some of the ways the game is played such as button mashing or only using one move over and over again. Definitely a fun movie to watch if you can handle the gore, especially if you're a fan of the games.",Mortal Kombat

Which is weird as i always see liukang as one of the grup leader.

As the story develops; so does our fighters, with every fighter finding their special ability, or arcana as they are called in this movie.

So it was either smart to make this movie a bit more long (20-30mins at least), or to use less characters.First Mortal Kombat ('95 if i remember correctly) was better for me, it had easier plot, a bit less characters, a bit less background but the plot was done as good as possible, this one had way more potentially better plot, but it was too rushed and forced.I liked Raiden, Liu Kang, Sonya, Shao Tshung (or how it is written) way more in original movie, here a i liked more Keyno. Goro too beacuse of better CGI, but not as a character.Wrongs with this movie were:
1. Too fast plot after 1st thrid of a movie
2. Bad choices for some characters
3. Creating whole new character just for the movie
4. Very unsatisfying finish of battle between Keyno and Sonya (it just had to be better finish)
5. Poor explanation of certain origins and poor origins of some characters anyhow
6. Mortal Kombat is a tournament - and there is no tournament here, just an idea that, at least for me, did not work properly.All in all 6, first movie i would rate 7.5, and considering the year that it came out even 8.Effects were almost perfect.Fights had too many illogic, but were pretty good to see.Plot i explained already.I think that when MK Rebirth came out they should've made movie (not series) out of it, cast was much better.Is it worth watching - yes.Do I hope for a sequel - yes.Do i hope for sequel to fix mistakes from this one - definitely yes!And, this is just my opinion, honest and fresh since i just watched, no mean to disrespect or anything like it. :)",Mortal Kombat

But the movie definitely makes up for anything that could be complained about. Let me just say the casting could not have been any better, and we got to see some all time classic characters make a debut on screen. The feud between Sub-Zero and Scorpion was just as epic, if not more epic than the games and the comics. I would love to see a sequel, but slightly more fleshed out than the concepts in this movie. The way things are presented set up for a series of movies following suit to the classic games, making the ideas more digestible for movie fans. The things that were changed, were understandably changed, besides Jaxx's arms. And everything sets up for a perfect sequel that hopefully we will get. Let's all try not to review bomb it, like everyone has been doing with movies lately. It has its flaws, as any first time director will make. But the movie is pretty badass in many ways still.

I'm an old school MK fan so the fact that the main character was NOT an MK character was a little off putting -- AT FIRST. I actually really grew to like Cole. And his Arcana is dope. Hope they throw him on the MK rosters in the future!!! Kano was hilarious, the graphics were so sick. The plot was actually fairly well thought out in my humblest of opinions. One thing I will say is that this movie gets 9/10 instead of 10/10 because I like my Sub-Zero as a good guy. But he's one fuckin hell of a bad guy! Watch it. Enjoy it.

In the movie, the fight choreography was usually fairly good, though nothing spectacular. However, the characters were all bland and none of them showed much of any particular personality except Kano, Liu Kang, and Cabal, and of those three, only Kano was interesting. With all of the awesome characters in almost thirty years of Mortal Kombat video games, why did they come up with a new protagonist as flavorless as bone broth? What the heck was his power, an Aquaman shirt that glows when hit (ostensibly absorbing the power?)

For literally every other aspect of the movie it was just not good. The plot, very subzero. The acting, not even close. Kano was the best actor in my opinion. I know it's hard with martial art films because you have to find people who can act and execute combat.

1624,blackninja-2,Adequate start of the possible franchise,8,24 April 2021,"It's not amazing. Don't expect it to take your breath away. But despite issues here and there, it is still fairly decent. Especially for a 40 million budget and rookie director. The fights are predominantly great, some just ok. Most actors fit their characters and do the best job they can. Sub Zero is the ultimate badass, I had chills like from Freddy Krueger in my childhood in a couple of situations when he entered the scene. A handful of characters do their fatalities from newer games and old too which all look awesome. And it appears as if the film deliberately strives to strengthen the plot points where the old movie was weak. Passerby no longer can enter the upcoming MK tournament, you are to work and deserve it. Everyone is training and getting ready, no situation of Cage and Sonia lured into the tournament, unaware of what did they get themselves into. They introduce a new concept to avoid specifically that. In the future this will lead to no ""ordinary people fights against trained outworld killers with superpowers"" who in the old movie had to make questionable decisions, stand still at some point of the fight and await death (Sub Zero and Scorpion). And finally the story from MK1 of the two just mentioned is told in full.The issues are editing near the end of movie, kind of rushed, uneven pacing and the nominal protagonist Cole Young. He's an alright actor and fighter, a likable, not irritating character, but nevertheless feels unnecessary. His family is rather cardboard. And of course Raiden and Shang Tsung are pale shadows of themselves from 1995. Can't even blame the actors, no one can match Lambert and Tagava and they ain't got much to work with here. Raiden's character is very different from Lambert's though so not easy to compare. He is dead serious in most of his scenes and for a reason.Overall, it is a decent effort and I rather recomend to go see it than not. Just don't overhype yourself.",Mortal Kombat

Guys, listen, we got what we asked for, we wanted to see the blood and guts and gore the game series is famous for and we got that. For heavens sakes someones head gets clapped and explodes! Now I understand the writing was plain and possibly even lazy, I understand there was no MK tournament and that disappointed me to, but society is busy pointing out flaws, we got a good movie with a good runtime and some solid gore (seriously that stuff is nasty) but because of the lack of the MK tournament meant we got fight scene after fight scene. I watched this movie with my dad and we genuinely enjoyed it, we laughed out loud at most of Kanos lines (props to his actor btw).

1629,shiicijnpi,Would have been better as a series,8,24 May 2021,"Casting was great (I'm especially happy with Raiden as I hated Christopher Lambert in the originals and thought his performance was terrible. I'm glad they did better with Tadanobu Asano), makeup/special effects SO much better than originals, but I think this story would have been better served as a series or limited series. It would've given them more time to explore the characters and get to the actual Mortal Kombat tournament, which we were robbed of in this. Also, having Cole as the hero of the film kind of fell flat as he was never really elevated too much above the other characters and his arcana, while useful, was a bit underwhelming when compared with others like Liu Kang. It felt like they kind of ripped off Shuri's updated suit in Black Panther with the whole redistributing power from enemies' blows thing.Im disappointed that Kano had to die as well, because he was such an incredible character overall and it would've been great to be able to see him in upcoming projects. Maybe they'll figure out a way to bring him back.The best thing about this movie for me was Bi-Han and Hanzo Hasashi and I really hope to see a spin-off delving more into their history together, which could also be done justice in a series as mentioned above. Having really enjoyed both actors in some of their other work, I would love to see more of them and get to know more of the backstories of Subzero and Scorpion.While I did enjoy the original movie as a kid and have occasionally watched it again over the years for nostalgia, it occurred to me that part of the reason for it not being unwatchable was that they were trying to copy Enter the Dragon with much of the plot. Overall, this movie was decent and certainly much better than the original (and they didn't even have to borrow major parts of the story from Bruce Lee), but they didn't really allow themselves to do all of the characters justice.",Mortal Kombat

I missed that music as well as background score. Action was poor than 1995 movie. In 1995, there was no much CGI visuals like present time but everything better than tis movie. Action is slow in this movie. If you are making a martial art action movie, action must be better while in 1995 movie action was fast.If we compare casting of this movie with 1995 movie, which is not perfect like earlier movie. Christopher Lambert was better than Tadanobu Asano as Lord Raiden. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was better than Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Shang Tsung. Bridgette Wilson was better than Jessica McNamee as Sonya Blade. Hiroyuki Sanada has worked with Jackie Chan in ""Rush Hour3"" and he is a martial artist. But his action sequence was very lazy. I can not imagine actor like him will do this type of action in action movies.Finally comes to Liu Kang, Robin Shou portrayed a complete character of Liu Kang while Max Huang can not stand with Robin Shou. Max Huang looks like a kid in whole this movie and he is not impressive. If company want to sequel of this movie, my suggestion is cast new actor as Liu Kang.Story of this movie is good that why i have given 2 star of this movie.",Mortal Kombat

Scorpion and SubZero are.... hard to explain to be honest, they lack ANY real back story, charisma, and sadly even look, their costumes are just some random rags tighten here and there.Story is just awfully lame, with holes so big and deep that you cant see bottom.Most annoying is pacing and lack of any sense, there are some ruch moments, stop for lame joke and then next boring fight....But still its far from ending that is just mind blowing... because lack of any actual story they LITERALY JUST TELEPORTED main characters to some random arenas to fight. Then for no reasons moved to gym from the beginning... and that's it...CG is just there.... colorful crisp and out of place in most of scenes.Music is annoying out of place and lack that PUNCH that would give you some feel of action.Overall this new Mortal Kombat remind me of most of those new remakes from past years, mostly last Predator movie: weird illogical story, quick colorful action scenes with cheese jokes between and really bad and annoying ending...Skip it and just watch old Mortal Kombat...",Mortal Kombat
1639,keithrhuff,How? What? Why?,5,25 April 2021,"I had really high hopes for this film after seeing the trailers and initial concepts but man did it disappoint. Let's start out with the good.Pro's:
Scorpion and Sub-Zero, by far the best aspects of the film and it was smart to start and end with these two because it's makes a strong entrance and exit.The arcana was an interesting concept and situation how each person attained their ""special move"" as it were.-The dragon marking was another device that worked and notion of it passing from individual to induvial was both a harkened back to Kombat coins and also gave a ""leveling up quality.""-Costuming for the most part seemed to work balancing the video game quality while being manageable in the real world.Cons:
The script. Yes, I don't expect the script for an MK film to be Oscar worthy but you know when you have an armature on your hands when there is just unnecessary swearing. A f-word every five seconds is so out of place that you could tell that this person is not a seasoned writer.A new character. Yes, I've read the director's comments on introducing a new character and I guess you could argue that it sounds good in theory, but in practice it's not. Cole, a MMA fighter who can't win a match to save his own life, takes out the reigning MK champion Goro? Come on now.-The lack of lore. The foundation of MK lies in a simple idea. Fighters representing their realms in Mortal Kombat. Yes, the film is setting up the tournament; however, there are rules here in the lore. Shang Tsung is not even remotely powerful enough to go against the elder gods or even to challenge Raiden for that matter. Shao Kahn won't even do it up front and has to look for loop holes. This was just silly.Shang Tsung hanging out on some random outdoor throne in Outworld because...?The characters chosen. Nitara? The representation of Reptile?-Scorpion's arc. Scorpion's entire arc in the MK game relies on the fact that his ENTIRE clan is massacred, ENTIRE. Without this, his quest for revenge makes little sense.We deserved better. If film makers want to adapt video games to the screen then they should just do that, adapt it. You want to make your own film with your own lore and own story...great!

And don't say ""It was done for fans etc."" I'm fan since 1994 and still play every MK game but this movie is a huge disappointment.I'm not complainig about the plot, It was expected nothing special, I have no problems with no Kitana and Johnny Cage and even Cole Young is not so bad.The main problem for me is almost complete absence of fight scenes I can't even call it a fight scenes, more like accidents honestly except for maybe only Scorpion/Sub-Zero which is not amazing just exists at least ( all creativity was shown in the trailer) definitely not enough for me. Almost every fight was short poor and absolutely not exciting and not interesting to watch. Instead we have a poor written dialogs and stupid Kano jokes which were given more screen time than actual fights.I really wanted to see Mileena in action not just 5 min screen time. The whole year I saw Sisi Stringer worked hard practiced at martial arts with sais etc. WHAT FOR? (and the same problem with almost every character). She looks good, I was really glad to see her as Mileena but the character potential is not even 5% unlocked. I hope she will return in the next movie.In the sequel if it will happen I really want to see all fights at least Scorpion/Sub-Zero screen time level and Mileena with a more dignified role.",Mortal Kombat

1650,virusgamingkbf,A failed fan service,5,26 April 2021,"MILD SPOILERS AHEAD.Right of the bat, I'm going to say I never held large expectations for this to ever succeed or shatter the barrier that is the video game adaptation into the screen curse. It just never ceases to continue, because studios can't comprehend some things just don't work as a movie or TV series. That being said, I'm going to pass some flaws, because it's first director that had to work with a script unfavorable to source material, because New Line Cinema wanted to introduce diverse variety of fans unaware of this franchise. Despite that, I will continue to judge it as another movie, because there are no favorites in my book.The peaks of this movie are combat scenes, VFXs and soundtracks, however general poor writing with wooden characters alongside zero background, apart from 2 characters that were quite short and left more to be desired and out of place pacing with non-justifiable reason as to why it had to happen pre-major arc makes no sense. The fan service while cool on paper, was absolutely bland in terms of effective execution. Well established and less mainstream characters were simply butchered for nothing, instead of keeping them the appropriate way alive. The only character I can only boast about was Kano, because his performance was genuinely satisfying, but the rest of the kast not so much. Cole Yong afaik, was shoehorned by New Line Cinema to attract new audiences so he held little value, if any at all.If New Line Cinema green-lights the sequel then they should appropriately include less characters for the tournament arc (despite how hard it would be), but much more polished. Because anyone outside of Mortal Kombat universe most likely were confused as to why these characters exists given there were absolutely no ultra short origin stories for each one of them.Concluding this with 5/10.",Mortal Kombat

1656,mbmcmil,Movie adaptation for one of the greatest games ever,7,24 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat was one of the most iconic video games ever created and while this movie was not perfect; it did have some appeals to it especially for those who are fans of the games.Plot: The plot was a very basic one of the classic ""super hero"" troth. It did not offer much as far as interesting plot developments or game changing twists; it was just a very straight by the book plot line. While this is ok, there was definitely room to build and to have a little more of a rising and falling narrative.Acting: Acting was very typical for what you get from a cheesy karate movie. While it was nowhere near that comparison of bad, there were no award winning performances or even notable performance. Best performance goes to Josh Lawson as Kano but he had it easy as the cheeky bad guy that everyone loves.Storytelling: This was going to be tough telling the story of a video game that is not known for its plotlines. While the writers were able to create a decent enough that could be followed along, it was still nowhere near next level film and there is probably nothing that could have been done to get it to that level. They did the best with what was there.Creativity; Creativity and making something unique is tough when you are going by the book of a video game. I felt the writers achieved that in some capacity but as mentioned in storytelling; it is something that is just really hard when it comes to a story such as this one.Other Factors: The other factors that this movie achieved best on was cinematography, CGI, and setting. These three components made up for it really well especially in areas when acting and storytelling lacked. These things are also especially needed when your whole sell is based on good action scenes and this was achieved well.Overall, I felt Mortal Kombat was a decent watch. It is nothing to root home for and I probably will never watch it again but it checked the boxes it needed to and was a great weekend watch at the home but a viewing experience that probably would have been accented by the movie theater but overall not bad.",Mortal Kombat
1657,brownpride-96508,"Nice fight scenes, no tournament",7,25 April 2021,"As a MK fan since the early days, I was a bit disappointed that there was no tournament. The movie starts good and resembles the last MK animated movie (made by Warner Brothers) with Scorpion being the central person. After that the story is very weak with no tournament. Also the cast of ""good guys"" weren't looking impressive, except Jax. The main character who is supposed to be a descendant of Scorpion is sooooo weak and his arcana is just growing a long sleeve armour + weapons. The fight with Goro was nice, but they shouldn't have killed him. I hope this movie was a good introduction for a sequel.",Mortal Kombat

1663,ccbenckert,Where do I begin with this....,1,27 April 2021,"I feel like there's a direct correlation between how many F bombs are dropped in this movie and how horrible the acting is. They tried to compensate WITHOUT A DOUBT by inserting the F word in nearly every line/scene. Completely unnecessary and wouldn't have helped anyways. Then there's Prince Goro.....curious, how does Marvel feel about them ripping off Hulk's face?! Liu Kang has been turned into some pre-pubescent kpop singer with a bad wig...what is he like 17?. And Scorpion's appearance is so embarrassingly brief, it's more like a cameo.. Literally only in the last 20 mins of the movie. I mean.....really? Is this meant to be portrayed as a remake or a pre-story? Maybe a side story? Cause it seemed like it couldn't make up its mind. I'm disturbed that they released this under the original movie's name as if it's a remake when it's a completely different storyline that doesn't even include a MK tournament. The entire movie is Shang Tsung trying to cheat to prevent a MK tournament. No Princess Katana, Johnny Cage is referenced on a movie poster in the last 5 seconds of the movie.... Scorpion speaks Japanese and can't understand Sub Zero who speaks Chinese, but somehow learned how to say his signature ""Get Over Here"" in English..sigh..yeah ok... they can't even understand each other as they speak different languages but somehow are mortal enemies? Uh yeah ok. Makes total sense. (Eye roll) Character development, makeup and special effects are cringe worthy. And in at least 2 parts of the movie there's weird jumping/cutting going on, like my 8 yr old edited the movie. There's just so much wrong with this movie. It's a dishonor to the original. It was painful to sit through.",Mortal Kombat
1664,davidugarte-35647,"Plot holes, cliches, and problematic tropes abound in this uninspired hack job",1,28 April 2021,"The opening scene of Scorpion's family's murder at the hands of Sub-zero comes with no explanation at all. Sub-zero seems to be hunting Scorpion's clan for some unexplained reason, and somehow found Scorpion simultaneously in hiding with bodyguards, yet totally unprepared. Whatever their rivalry, it is left totally in the dark, and from there, the plot goes downhill.Cole's introduction to the impending Mortal Kombat tournament is done in a rushed and confusing series of events that create more questions than they answer. How did Jax find him in the first place? Why is the mark of the tournament champions being passed down to Cole through his bloodline? Does the mark get passed down through every bloodline, unless an individual is killed? Are killers inherently stronger and more worthy than their victims, under any circumstances?How did Sub-zero find Cole conveniently moments after Jax found him and started following him? What kind of supernatural ninja fails to murder a completely unarmed and unsuspecting guy in a restaurant?Sony and Jax claim to be part of a special task force researching the Mortal Kombat phenomenon, but they appear to have 0 resources. They are literally operating out of Sonya's childhood trailer-house, with the cliché spiderweb of pictures and news-clippings tacked to the walls, and no money or any other sort of support for their work.Sonya has conveniently already captured Kano, giving us a brief, unsatisfactory after-the-fact explanation for why he is chained to a chair in her trailer house when we meet him. Again, Reptile manages to find Sonya and Cole and get to them without any explanation.Another odd threadbare plot connection is that Kano conveniently knows where Raiden's Temple is, and he candidly tells Sonya and Cole this, before bargaining to take them there for an absurd amount of money - sight unseen.While Jax, Sonya, Subzero, and Reptile have had no trouble finding Cole without any explanation, it seems Raiden and Lui Kang could not be bothered to go out to find Cole or Kano - but they did somehow manage to rescue Jax after he lost his arms to Subzero, and they had proceeded to simply wait around until Cole and Kano arrived, with less than a month to train for the tournament that they have been aware of forever, and which Cole has been marked for since the day he was born. So, I guess it would have been too much to expect Cole to be brought up preparing for this tournament that he was born to participate in.Apparently there are Elder Gods that simultaneously set the rules of the tournament, to determine the fates of worlds, but are also ""too lazy"" to do anything when Outer World cheats? Except Raiden, who is there to help Earth realm, but only so much? Seems difficult to believe...
Raiden's capacity to intervene in events seems poorly defined, as he goes out of his way to protect the champions from Shang Tsung, up to a point. When Shang Tsung finally penetrates Raiden's little shield barrier, Raiden claims to be obligated to stand by and remain neutral when Kung Lao is killed.Our john doe fanfiction writer's-ego Cole Young did not win a single fight on his own.His wife helped him with Goro.Raiden then agrees to use his teleportation ability to basically create game-like match-ups between champions. Sonya kills Kano - the most entertaining character in this whole movie by a mile - and she immediately masters her ""arcana"" power, offscreen, and then magically appeared to use it to save Cole once, before Cole goes on to continue getting his ass kicked by a second nemesis - Subzero.And then after burning in hell for hundreds of years, waiting for no particular reason, Scorpion showed up at JUST the right moment to save Cole from Subzero - but only after letting all the events of this movie unfold.Why does Scorpion say ""Get over here"" in English, when he exclusively speaks Japanese the rest of the movie? Why not say it in Japanese?Jax' ""arcana"" appears to simply be the ability to make his unbelievably frail mech-arms into the super strong arms we knew we'd be getting eventually. But how arcana - which generally appear in the forms of classic elemental magic like fire, ice, etc., make flimsy prosthetics into beefy robot muscles, I don't know. I am not an expert on ableism and the nuances of the ""supercrip"" trope, which I only vaguely understand can manifest itself in the form of a disabled person's disability is transformed into a super power, (think Daredevil, or like...half of all superheroes or Xmen) but I'm pretty confident that this was a solid example of the definition of that ugly, tired trope.In general, the ""arcana"" premise seems like an unnecessary new piece of non-canon plot-development that also feels like a cliché we've seen in fantasy stories ad nauseum, and I found that whole element of the story clunky and distracting.Worse, this whole storyline feels like it's thrown out some of the best parts of the ""canon"" plot of the Mortal Kombat games, whose story has really been getting interesting in the last few instalments.What it really feels like is some amateur's sophomoric fan-fiction in which Cole is their generic John Doe add-in character so they can live out the fantasy of becoming part of the Mortal Kombat universe, canon be damned. The problem with this movie is 90% the script, an uninspired mix of unexplained, rushed plot points, and not-good kitchiness, mediocre dialogue, and hit-and-miss comic relief.",Mortal Kombat

Wierd pacing, I found this movie at a wierdly fast pace that when the movie ended I thought it was only half done, I also felt as if the bad guys like Kabal and Mileena were just phoned in and didn have any involvment as characters even tho they are some of my favourite characters, contrary to what other people say I actually like Cole, I think a Mortal Kombat movie with all characters being known would be kind of boring so im glad we had a character we dont know but he could have used a bit more develpment than just being the father who is put in a dangerous situation and who just so happens to be the son of scorpion but I do appreciate what they were trying to do.

1677,jrmyhvl,Great but cole left a sour taste,10,10 May 2021,"Tl;DR - A lot of people touted that the curse of bad video game movies finally ended with Sonic, I didn't fully agree with this. But seeing something just as iconic as the latter makes me believe it a little more, Mortal Kombat movie is not some amazing recreation of the game but a competent argument for the 'Video game movies are now good' side.The Good
A lot of things were well done, primarily the fight scenes and I believe that the character's personalities are well captured from the overall mythos of Mortal Kombat franchise.The gore was welcome and so was the competent CGI that was used to create this movie, some uncanny valley stuff pops up here and there but everything pretty much holds up.The best part of the movie was Kano however, I did not expect to enjoy the smart/foul mouthed Australian stereotype portrayal. I guess casting a true blue Aussie like Josh Lawson paid of well. I was genuinely sad to see him die, hopefully some Shang Tsung sorcery will bring him back for a sequel. Shout out to Sanada for giving a short but great performance as Hanzo/The face of the MK franchise aka Scorpion.Jessica/Blade, Mechad/Jax, Han/Tsung, Lin/Liu, Huang/Lao and Asano/Raiden all looked like they enjoyed their time on sets and really got the essence of the MK franchise in their interactions.The Bad
My one hope is that Cole does not come back in the sequel or if he does they give him the Cage treatment from Annihilation and then transfer over the POV of the hero to the actor that plays Cage.Cole was quite boring just stumbling from one set piece to another except for the end where he faces off vs Goro. I get the need for a audience viewpoint into a new world but do all these slapped on characters in such franchises need to be a wet towel, I'm sure they can do better.The pacing was a bit off, going briskly from plot point to plot point at a good speed and then just turbocharging into the climax suddenly it was a bit abrupt but manageable.All in all this was a fun watch just like Sonic, not gonna be watching this again for a while but hopefully there will be a sequel.The spirit is there and even though the 95 movie will always be my jam this is a good attempt nonetheless that deserves one more chance to get it right.",Mortal Kombat

I was really enjoying it.The fighting and blood effects were 10/10.But the main kharacter Kole was bad, really bad. He was unnecessary since there are so many great kharacters in the MK universe. His acting was horrible. Sonya was not much better. Kano was funny, probably the highlight of the movie.I understand the reasoning of hiring stunt/martial arts experts for the leads. But bad writing and bad acting really killed this. Hiroyuki Sanada as Scorpion was fantastic and if the movie had been based around him instead of the made up Kole kharacter, he could have saved it. Also WTF was his ""special move""...lameness? If Kole was a playable kharacter, nobody would use him. Stryker level bad.When movies are made that think to hard about a potential sequel, mistakes are made. I really hope that when/if a sequel is made, Scorpion is the lead, actors are hired for the ""safe from death"" kharacters, and talented martial artists are only hired for great fight scenes for the expendable Kharacters.Give me the 1995 movie, with the special effects from this movie, and a perfect MK movie would exist.",Mortal Kombat

1726,Rhydil,"Extremely Bad Plot (It's a Hollywood Video Game adaptation, what you expect...)",3,11 April 2021,"Im a fan of the game since i was a kid, and I grow up watching the first 1991 movie.I am judging this solely as a film, and why I think the film is extremely bad while keeping simple and short as possible.The plot of the film is incredibly bad, and the main protagonist, Cole Young, is a very dull and undeveloped character.I wish the studio should have just follow one of the original characters instead, because when the film begins, it shows that the film could have become a great film.Why is it bad?We are introduced to a few heroes with zero clue and not much development time for to be invested on them.The film we follows the main character name Cole Young, which the studio thought it was a great idea to add as an new original character for the film, so the viewer who doesn't know anything about MK can relate to based on his perspective.Instead Cole Young turn up to be unrelatetable, uninteresting and a waste of space.There's really nothing much we know about him, other than he's bloodline, he was a mma champion, and now days he take fights where he throw the towel for money.Do I care about him? Do I root for him? Am I interested about his backstory? No,cause it's nothing interesting about him. Is like the Goku in Dragon Ball live action, less stupidity, but more plain.The acting was just mediocre, not great, but some of the scenes are bad, and the casting is questionable.For example, Sonya Blade, isn't she an elite soldier?, an elite soldier who looks like a model. Really? Unbelievable.Liu Kang, he's character I found very awkward and humouring, mainly because he's like that dude in class who enjoy plays D&D, but no one is actually playing with him at the moment, but he's still in character. When you watch LOTR, something that set in fantasy medieval time, most of us do not question the behaviour or action or a person in that film, even thought is a fantasy film. But Liu Kang in this film is just unnatural and unbelievable acting is something can't be ignore.Also the actor for Liu Kang is so good looking, in any shot, to the point it such a distraction.Regarding to plot, and how the story progress, it was extremely rush, and we are also reminded by the characters with the simple line, ""We do not have time"". From the ambush scene from sub zero at the diner, until we meet Liu Kang at the temple, we reminded by the characters again and again.It should be note that, we are not even in the tournament yet, the whole film is about what happened before the tournament.The fact thay they making the same mistake as Spiderman 3, introducing too many villain, and also heroes, with no proper develop and delivery story, is just plain sad , the fact that people still make same mistake not learning from the past in 2021The action scene is your cliché Hollywood fight scenes, that consist of your usual fast pace fight that the camera will be cut every 4&5 seconds, nothing that memorable to me, afterall I think the best fight scene is already shown in the trailer, scorpion vs SubZero, that's it.If you're a Cinephile, it's waste of time.If you just want to see a Mortal Kombat Film, because it's a Mortal Kombat, this franchise is for you.",Mortal Kombat
1727,jezzagt,Not as good as I was hoping for,5,23 April 2021,"While this was okay to decent, I preferred MK legacy and even the original cheesy 1995 film to this one.

They really didn't do justice to many of the characters and the decision to add a new character did not sit well with me. The treatment of Goro in this movie was criminal and the actor who portrayed Shang Tsung was a terrible casting choice.The CGI was good, and I felt they handled the gore really well (not too little, not too much), but I found the fights as a whole to be quite lackluster.Having Sub-Zero as main villain was cool (pun intended). But needed more Scorpion and less Cole (or better yet, no Cole).Overall, enjoyable enough to pass the time, but don't get your hopes up too high or you will be disappointed.",Mortal Kombat

1731,carlosjacinto-480-791140,Not easy to classify this one - first with no spoilers and then with spoilers,6,19 April 2021,"OK it is definitely not easy to rate this one, and I will explain why.REVIEW WITH NO SPOILERS ---
I just came back from cinema in Portugal (premiere was today), and right away I have a few comments.1st comment: The gore is finally there (the lack of it was not necessarily a problem in the 90s but it is a MUST nowadays since the target is now grown-up people who played the videogames as a kid and is now an adult in the 30s and 40s). Rated-R was a requirement from the true fans. Period.2nd comment: Costume design is not bad at all. It would be pretty easy to make the characters look dumb and lame because there are things which work in a videogame but not in a live-action movie. I think at this level, it is not bad at all (except maybe for Reiko since the pattern on his face was clearly not well designed - there are true fans which found it hard to recognize him). Goro, Reptile, Jax's arms, Kano's eye, Rayden's eyes and Mileena's mouth are obviously CGI, but a part from that, the costume design is definetely good/acceptable.3rd comment: There are clearly two different sets/scenarios, and one works much better than the other. Outworld looks very good. A desolate place, dark, intense, and it was not CGI (filmed in the south of Australia). However, Rayden's temple looks kinda boring and with no real fit in the movie. Other filming places are acceptable, but these two take the majority of the movie time.Now the review itself (with no spoilers):
For true hardcore fans, it is hard to classify this. From one hand, it fits the MK style and is fun to watch, but on the other, the pace is totally wrong (too fast and many things are not explained at all).For someone which played the games and is not a true hardcore fan, it is worse: they recognize a few characters from what they remember, but then a lot is happening and they do not really get it.For someone with no prior relation to MK, the film is a mess. They will not understand the MK universe at all, and that in my opinion is a mistake. 5 minutes would be enough to give a little context, which would work for all these 3 levels of people.Finally, the music. OMG the music. People in the cinema were praying for the music the whole time, which came too late in the movie, just a few seconds, and with no real impact as it should be. MK's music was part of the experience in the 90s (techno syndrome) and they almost left it out. Putting the remastered version in the ending credits was not enough for the true fans. And, this version is not special at all (I have heard a few fan versions/remixes on the net which are much better).In the end I have to say I am not impressed. A few things are better than the movies in the 90s, but others could be much better.NOW THE REVIEW WITH SPOILERS ---Let me start by the ""negative"" part:
There is one major mistake in this movie which leads to a whole lot of mistakes in my opinion. In order to explain it, I have to give a little context: the movie is all about the ""before"" of the tournament. Therefore, there is no real MK tournament in the movie, since everything happens just before that. I am okay with that part, if the intention is to continue with more movies (we will get there) but with this decision of having a movie before the tournament, they have decided to include one character that does not belong to the MK universe at all (not in any game nor in any other form of MK before): Cole Young. And Cole is a big mistake which leads to many other mistakes and I will explain why. The ""idea"" of having Cole is for having someone to explain what MK is - but they definitely fail at that. Cole is almost the main protagonist (kind of), and having an unknown character in that role is a mistake. They could have done two things: you either go with the Liu Kang decision (as 1995's movie) or you go with Scorpion Vs. Sub-zero. In this movie is more about the second option, but Cole was not necessary.Then, there are mistakes with this character. First, he is the one who kills Goro, which should not happen before the tournament. Then, the twist of having him be adescendent of Hanzo Hasashi, which is too much predictable (I think I could say that just by looking at the trailer). And finally, the story about the dragon markings which is explained through him, and how that ""opens"" the arkana skills, is kinda silly. I would prefer something more simple and less dumb.A few errors that only the true hardcore fans take notice: Rayden is a god, but is NOT an Elder God as stated in the movie. And this is relevant for those who know the story and the meaning of being an Elder God. God -> Elder God -> Titan is something they should not fail to explain.Now the good things:
The first 10 minutes are actually pretty good and intense (probably the best part of the movie in my opinion). They really nailed it in the war between Lin Kuei (Bi Han) and the Shirai Ryu (Hanzo Hasashi). Everything is correct in this scene, starting in feudal Japan, explaining how Bi-Han killed Hanzo, etc. Hanzo going to hell could be shown right away (as they did in the animated movie ""Scorpion's revenge""), but that is just an editing decision which I am fine with it.The final twist of revealing Cole travelling to Hollywood to meet Johnny Cage is kinda funny and a good way to finish a movie that is supposed to happen before the tournament. Kinda makes sense and is a good thing.The fight choreography is fine for the majority of it.I cannot give more than 6/10.It is too fast paced, not explaining the realms, the tournament, what Shang Tsung is trying to achieve by attacking, etc.The fights are OK (at least the majority of it), but the feeling I have is that they tried too much to fit them in those scenarios, especially Rayden's temple where most of the movie takes place.A few CGI moments are also badly executed.Acting is not extremely good, just average.",Mortal Kombat

The pacing is terribly slow and the dialogues often drag (especially Kano talks way too much).The acting is pretty much forgettable. If you remember the old movie it felt like nobody really took themselves too seriously and that's why it had this fun trashy 90's appeal. Now in 2021, the actors are trying a bit too hard to sound serious and that completely falls flat. Except for Sub-Zero and Scorpion in the opening scene there was actually nothing much to act in the first place.The Fighting choreography is average at best with few exceptions.

The action was excellent, some of the characters were admirably realized, and the film actually has me looking forward to potential sequels that would further flesh out the story and characters -- which is sorely needed.",Mortal Kombat

1743,kim-bagestam,Not bad but not good,1,27 April 2021,"For this movie I didn't have any high expectations, but the coming weeks before the movie launched on HBO Max certain Youtubers were hyping this movie and interviews came up with the maincast etc. If I didn't know better I would guess it was a marketing campaign from the people behind the movie.Seeing the trailers with Sub-Zero, Scorpion and the fights I admit I was looking forward to seeing the movie. And while the first 7-10 minutes were great of the movie the rest of the movie felt like fanfiction or made by students in comparison.The main character Cole is bland and boring, his dialogue is boring as well as his powers. And his reason for fighting to do right by/provide for his family that has been seen 1000 times over in other movies/shows already.The short fights is a real bummer too and they felt rushed. The one that carried the movie was Kano and the scenes with Sub-Zero & Scorpion were great too though.I think the budget for this movie would be in better hands with NetherRealm Studios & Ed Boon considering the story in the last 3 games is really great. Because this director/producer sadly doesn't know how to make a movie.I can't say I will watch this movie anytime again ever, for me the 1995 Mortal Kombat is the better movie still.",Mortal Kombat

Reiko and Nitara were odd choices considering both characters have only seen one appearance in the main storyline through 11 Games.Some of the character banter is down right cringe.

Which bugged me the most because it had all the potential to earn its ""flawless victory"" tagline, but it fell short.With the 1995 MK movie, you kinda fall in love with the main characters because they had personality and they were given time to shine on screen. With this movie however, I personally could not connect or feel anything towards most of the MK characters.

The first 10 minutes of the movie with Hiroyuki Sanada and Joe Taslim were great. Form that scene on, was only a downgrade. Main Character was unbelievable as the rest of the Crew, especially Sonya Blade. The actor who played Kano had a few great lines and he was in the contrary believable. I was not impressed with the performances of actors who have played Liu Kang, Raiden and Shang Tsung. To be honest, I've thought that the movie will have a better Storyline. The movie from 1995 had even a better Storyline than this one. On the other hand, the fight scenes were great.

As far as sci-fi/fantasy movies goes, this is one of the best of them. The action is top notch, John Wick set the standard and movies like mortal combat are following suit. Sub-zero and Scorpion were portrayed perfectly and sub-zero was in it just enough that you're happy at the end.

The opening sequence was AMAZING, the fighting choreography was epic, the cinematography was gorgeous the sets were good and the pacing was fast but great. The character development was virtually non-existent, but I'm sure they anticipate building some of that up in the next movie(s).

However, the choreography was excellent, the fighting and fatalities were great, there was cheese but not too much (have to expect some from Mortal Kombat though), the actors (especially Kano) were all great.There are definite flaws though. The CGI was mediocre, presumably due to budget constraints, but hopefully with the success of this movie we'll get a slightly larger budget for the next one that will hopefully lead to some better CGI.The other main flaw was the script. Now I wasn't expecting anything mind-blowing and yet, they teased me with that opening scene. Handled fantastically in every possible way, script including, I was then hoping the rest of the movie would keep up that pace but it kind of hit a bump with the introduction of Cole & all the other characters and setting up the MK world. It was that weird kind of thing where certain aspects seemed rushed (not enough backstory about anyone to care too much about their fate) yet other aspects made it all feel a little dragged out (trying to unlock their powers).There's too many details to go into here about it but the simple way to word my conclusion would be that this would actually work very, very well as a series. Most of the problems with this film and script and pacing/editing and I feel like a lot of that could be solved if it was episodic instead of trying to cram it all into an average-length movie. They could still do some films, like about certain characters or rivalries, but the main chunk of the universe and even the tournament itself, should all be part of a series in my opinion.",Mortal Kombat

It's exactly what I wanted to see from a Mortal Kombat movie my entire life. The vibe of the film is 100% accurate to what the games should be. I also loved the guy who played Kano he was by far I seen sealer in every single scene he was in and the guys who played Subzero and Scorpion were also great as well. Now the stuff I didn't like. The story was really bad, the scenes were directed/edited really choppy and the performances for the rest of the cast was very dry. And the whole way they got their powers was really wack. It basically got rid of a lot of the cool origin stories for a cliche ""chose ones"" scenario. The guy who played Shang Tsung (who is my favorite Mortal Kombat villain) was not very good and to be honest the guy who played him in the 90s version did a better job. But my biggest complaint by far is Cole. You have a plethora of amazing characters who could have been the main protagonist (Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Jonny Cage, Sonya, or even Subzeros damn brother) instead they use one of the most boring and generic good guys I have ever seen. Why!? You literally would have had an easier time using one that already exist. Also how are you going to call a movie Mortal Kombat and not have the tournament known as ""Mortal Kombat"". I don't know man I liked some parts about it but overall I was very disappointed. They got the fighting down and I liked Subzero, Kano, and Scorpion but overall it just felt kind of lifeless and generic. Also... WHERE THE HELL IS JOHNNY CAGE!

None of that is explained in the film, ever. It just happens. 🤔 kind of lazy in my opinion. It was cool to see Scorpion as a good guy for once, I liked that. Liu Kang was not masculine enough at all, the guy from the 1st MK film did a way better job as Liu Kang. Subzero did an ok job as a villain...this is the first subzero who died in the first tournament, Bi Han. So this means we have yet to see the good version of Subzero and Bi Han will return as Noob Saibot i am hoping. Shang Tsung did not resemble Shang Tsung from the video games at all, he looked like some random guy off the street they decided to cast...so that was kind of lame. Kano's humor was entertaining but sometimes felt a little forced, he literally never would shut up. And yes, I know that in canon, he will always be a bad guy but it was nice to see him as a good guy for a while. Jax was a boring character and kind of cringey, I felt like they could have cast a different person and it would have given Jax more purpose. The guy who played Raiden was physically too short and not very god-like at all, and his arrogant demeanor at times was annoying. They did a good job with Sonya, i feel like she got the part down very well. Reptile being a cgi character in only his reptile form and not in his green ninja outfit was kind of meh. I felt like he deserved a bigger role because he is one of the best characters. Kung Lao was well done, I was sad to see him taken out by such a lame version of Shang Tsung. Kabal was very well done, he was one of the coolest characters in the film. I prefer when they get the characters as close to the video game characters as they can in the films. Scorpion, Sub Zero, and Raiden were all short guys in this film and they are all over 6 ft in the video games. Also, why were Reiko and Natara, two of the most forgettable characters even in this film? I guess it made sense to get rid of them early if they plan on making many more films. Overall, storyline: 7...not bad for a prequel and I liked scorpion and sub-zero backstory. Cgi: 8...could have had more gore honestly but things looked realistic. Goro and reptile were cool. Acting: 5...the good performances were stunk out by the bad. Shang Tsung, Liu Kang, Jax, and Raiden were not casted well at all. This is a shame because they are very important characters. Next time, I hope they pay attention to details that made the games so successful and include those details in the next movie. Otherwise, this was a very valiant effort and an enjoyable film. Good job on bringing Mortal Kombat back to life on the big screen! Let's see what you have next.IT HAS BEGUN!!!!!!!",Mortal Kombat
1806,coryjk-85766,Flawless victory,10,24 April 2021,"The movie is quite amazing down to the action and violence. The cgi is done really well and looks photorealistic for the most part besides some bits here and there. This is by far one of if not the best video game movie I have seen. There was a lot of attention to the lore which was mostly faithful, yet it can't be entirely faithful due to adapting to the medium. It's very gory and full of exactly what you would hope for in a mortal kombat movie. There are several characters I was not expecting which was a bonus.",Mortal Kombat
1807,p3r02d3r0,They actually listened to the fans' complaints following the trailer,7,23 April 2021,"The original Mortal Kombat movie remains one of my favorite videogame adaptations of all time. So, what about this one?One thing I can say is that this Mortal Kombat reboot is much more mature. More violence, more gore, a few great fatalities, and a somewhat better story, although the story is the weakest part of the movie. It's pretty cheezy, but... it's Mortal Kombat. Not Silence of the Lambs. The devil is in the details, and I like that Bi-Han and Hanzo are speaking Chinese/Japanese (most of the time).My biggest gripe is the way the characters ""gain"" their powers, but I won't go into details to avoid the spoilers.When it comes to Cole Young's character, he's pretty meh, but I understand why did they ""make"" him. Cole is that bridge that connects the videogame and the movie adaptation. Not great, not terrible.I'll also rate the most recognizable characters from the videogame that appear in the movie adaptation:Sub-Zero 9/10,
Sonya Blade 6/10,
Kano 7/10,
Shan Tsung 5/10 (liked the original one much more),
Raiden 6/10,
Liu Kang 7/10,
Kung Lao 8/10,
Jax 7/10,
Mileena 8/10,
Goro 9/10Some of the characters had much less screen time, but have made a better impression than the others, more prominent characters in the movie.Finally, for my closing points, I would like to give a BIG token of respect towards the production for actually listening to the fans following the trailer release. Sorry Mr. Sanada, but Ed Boon's original ""GET OVER HERE"" sounds much, much powerful.And they actually changed that.That's why I'm giving Scorpion's character a 10/10.More, please!",Mortal Kombat

However, this film was a pleasant surprise.This film stays true to the video game franchise on all levels. If you're a fan of the games, you will certainly recognise, not just the characters but also the fatalities and the gore that is so iconic and made this franchise what it is today. I feel like it could have been a bit longer and the story was somewhat simplistic, but I didn't expect an overly complicated plot from Mortal Kombat. A decent amount of action and some humour was enough for me to keep interested right until the end.If you're not a fan of the series I would probably give this a pass, otherwise it's a decent watch.",Mortal Kombat

1815,Anunnaki_Utu,Nothing here to see,1,26 April 2021,"Found this movie to be very disappointing. Injecting Kano as the idiot comedic relief (I suppose) was just lame. The fight sequences blinded you with goofy CGI effects and the storyline was, well... non-existent. Sure I may be influenced by the 97 version and the video game itself - but honestly, this take seemed to be interested in neither other than a couple of familiar character names. What I got out of this besides wasted time was ""hey! Watch the sequel""... ugh.",Mortal Kombat
1816,hhutchins-24476,Acceptable,7,25 April 2021,I am a fan of the video game series which has a huge following so it was satisfying in that sense. However I am also I fan of film and in that sense this was a let down. It included every feature that a mortal kombat geek would love but it also neglected any character development that could possibly make this a franchise.

In fact, the new protagonist is the worst of the bunch. His trademark ability is to literally physically manifest plot armor for himself. Once it appears, his plot armor makes one Cole Young impervious to any damage, removing tension from any fight he's in.The only remotely fun character was Kano, but even he gets thrown to the sidelines, once the plot no longer needs him. Hiroyuki Sanada was good as Scorpion, for the 10-15 minutes we got to see that character. The less said about others, the better.On a positive note, props to the costume designers and cinematographers. Unfortunately, good visuals are not enough to carry a film.",Mortal Kombat

I really liked the original from 1995 but thought that maybe they could better it. How wrong could I be. There is no character development. You don't learn of their backgrounds other than maybe Scorpion and Sub Zero. I felt some of the characters are misrepresented and are not close to the characters of the actual games, Kano and Liu Kang being perfect examples. It doesn't have the feel of a ""tournament"" as the fight scenes are mostly all happening at once and not exactly in good fight arenas/locations we would expect. The movie just feels completely rushed, and lacking storyline depth. The ending is complete garbage. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone sorry.",Mortal Kombat

In some scenes the shots aren't stable and the transitions aren't smooth between the scenes.Many plot holes which were acceptable to some extent for me because the movie was 1 hour and 50 minutes and i know the story. There was no enough time to present the characters and the background story efficiently.Most of cast performed very bad that u cringed a lot during watching.Pros:
Well executed interactions of CGI with the characters and the environment around.Fighting scenes and gore were on point.The film was fast paced with many fighting scenes and action that you can enjoy it without feeling bored. For me this point was what made the movie good and watchable.If you're a Mortal Kombat's fan go for it you'll enjoy it and what will make it better if you watch it with other MK's fans 👍",Mortal Kombat

1844,vegeta-74223,Disappointing,5,23 April 2021,"Reminded me of the 90s MK and MK: Annihilation movies, but I wouldn't necessarily say that['s a good thing. I loved those movies when I was 10 or so when they came out, but like i said i was 10. This felt kinda like a rehash of the first movie. They for whatever reason made a new character the main protagonist instead of choosing one of the many characters from the games. Spoiler, i guess, but he's an ancestor of Scorpion's character, and I'm baffled as to why they didn't write the story around Scorpion himself instead. I feel like that would have been more interesting that someone i couldn't care less about. Having his wife and daughter in a lot of the movie, mainly during a couple of fight sequences which were brought down by them just being there. They were fine as characters, just felt out of place in a Mortal Kombat movie. The whole story felt like that; out of place and flat. I kept wondering when the movie was going to start even as i watched the ending credits. I don't know what the writer/writers were thinking. Like they saw the 90s movies and said let's do that, but throw in a random guy and his family with basically the same characters that were in the first Mortal Kombat movie. And like that movie, the protagonists were some of the boring characters from the games. Sonya Blade and Jax were never interesting, and teasing him going to find Johnny Cage at the end of the movie made me laugh in bewilderment. They should have made the movie with more emphasis on Scorpion and Sub-zero as the main characters. I feel like that would be the obvious route to go, but maybe I'm just being nostalgic as they were, in my mind, the two more interesting characters from the games. It felt like a Mortal Kombat movie that was made in a lab by someone who saw the first movie, and remembered 'Fatality' from the game. I could nit pick for awhile on this, but i feel satisfied now. There wasn't even a tournament. Total waste of what could have been a great updated Mortal Kombat movie. Just watch the old ones and imagine the cgi is kinda better.",Mortal Kombat

1855,wordsbyjakob,~~Stay-Over-There-->>,1,24 April 2021,"After 25-odd years spent imaging what the MK universe could look like utilising current technology, I was thrilled to hear that this film was being made. However, within 15 minutes of watching this movie I realised that I was about to endure a level of Hell that not even Scorpion himself would be capable of enduring.The story itself is very clunky and the writers use some extremely rudimentary dialogue to try and bridge the gap for the audience. Compounding this issue are the wooden acting performances by a number of main characters in the film which make the excremental stench of the dialogue seem even more prominent.The prospect of seeing current day VFX paint the visuals of the MK world was a major point of excitement going into this movie, but any dreams that I had of seeing worlds with detail and grandeur of Azguard were slowly ripped away. From ice formations that looked like plastic through to a janky reptilian creature, it appears as though there was either not enough budget or a complete miscalculation from a style point of view. The MK world is supposed to be gritty and dark!Although there were moments where a darker setting managed to reduce the sting of the subpar graphics, much of the film is played out against backdrops that feel out of place for an MK movie and felt highly cartoonish. A certain 'Thunder God' who appears in this film looked downright ridiculous when viewed up close, sporting a pair of 'electric eyes' that were on par with the VFX seen in the Incredible Hulk series from
The 1970s.The performance of Josh Lawson as Kano was definitely the highlight of the movie, and would have fit perfectly as a point of levity if this film was executed in a more appropriately dark and brooding tone. The fight scenes involving Scorpion and Subzero were also a shinning light in this film, with both actors doing a fantastic job despite the script.Overall, the amount that is wrong with this film would not allow me to revel in the nostalgia of seeing some of my favourite characters on screen. There were points in this movie that were so cringeworthy that I may have uppercutted myself into a pit of spikes of given the chance, and upon reflection, the name 'Shang Stung' may have been an appropriate title for this movie, because It took a piece of my soul and left me feeling dead inside.",Mortal Kombat
1856,Sharon97,exciting enough for non gamer too !!!,8,19 April 2021,"Just watched MK, as someone never played the game, the movie was entertaining and exciting enough for me to enjoy !!! I love the music and japanese temple scenes as well as the final fights! Love Cole, he added some emotion and love to the film but wish there are bit more about him and his relationship with his loves one that we can build up more emotion towards him. Lord Raiden feels akward. My fav Sub0, Scorpion, Jax, Cole and his family. The guy with Hat he looks cool and got good move. Others are ok. The story is simple but again if there are more scenes about Cole and his family maybe will make us woman non gamer happier. Fighting is exciting but not sure if it's R rated level. In general it's worth to watch in cinema ! Won't be very good on TV. Needs sound system and big screen. Definitely a good movie to watch during Covid !!!!",Mortal Kombat

I guess you can call it that,5,24 April 2021,"Going into this movie I didn't really have high expectations at all, and after watching the movie I'm glad I didn't have high ones at all.... to begin the characters really didn't look cool at all if we're all being honest... no one was jacked in the movie besides Jax, you can come at me with the argument that they don't need to be jacked to look cool, and I would agree with you but their ""costumes"" or look if you will didn't even look remotely close to any of the previous video games that have come out after Mortal Kombat 9. The story was also very half assed if you ask me... I will say I did like the twist they try to put on the movie about when they kill a chosen fighter for the fortunate that the Video Game's logo appears on their body as if it was a birthmark for being chosen, not really related to the video game but as I stated before the take on it was unique so I have to give props where it's due. I have to say I was very surprised that they showed various characters, to seeing Goro on screen after 30+ Years was very refreshing, to the Baraka painting, and even the Johnny Cage half poster at the very end... overall I do believe the story could've been put together better, the last 45 minutes feel very rushed. The whole time I was waiting for their training to finish and then fight in the actual Mortal Kombat tournament that we never even get to see??? Not to mention Raiden was the most useless character of all time just sitting in an empty room and teleporting every 15 minutes to never seeing him even engage in combat was very weak. Sonya Blade was just there I guess??? She wasn't chosen till the last 30 minutes were a sequence of all Earth Realm fighters just going HAM out of nowhere to defeat the Outworld contenders... Basically what I'm trying to say this movie really wasn't all that and it could've been done a whole lot better.",Mortal Kombat

But being a huge Mortal Kombat fan as a kid inclines me to give my opinion on this movie. Really the subject line says it all...loved the non-stop (super gory) action throughout the movie. Absolutely HATED the made-up storyline, which not only left one of the most important/iconic characters, Johnny Cage, out of the movie, but also made-up dumb characters like Cole (Scorpion's ""Son"" who isn't a real character). I really thought for a moment he was going to be the next Scorpion...but then all he gets is some stupid looking upper body armor (not even the whole body?!?). The ending was also lackluster with Kole non-effectively punching his frozen family in a fighting octagon...his family who should really be dead from the ice. Jax and Kano weren't in the original story until it expanded...and Jax was cool but Johnny Cage is definitely more important and cool than Kano and his pathetic laser eye. The thing that bothered me most though, was that they didn't even start the tournament...basically fought to not have a tournament...which takes a lot of the excitement/fun away.All in all...DO BETTER ON THE SEQUEL!!!!!",Mortal Kombat

The storyline is whole new with the perspective from Cole Young, but didn't went too far from the original root. If you expect a lot of battle with good coreographic, this film will satisfy you! I personally very skeptical about how new character like Cole Young will fit in the movie since many fans demand more for famous character like Johnny Cage, but ended up like the character. The casts for me are perfect for Sonya, Jax and Kabal. For Sub Zero and Scorpion, both Joe Taslim and Hiroyuki Sanada, they're beyond perfect, like they're born to play this role! Many easter eggs and other characters mentioned in this film, no one is forgotten! Also don't worry about Scorpion's legendary ""Get Over Here!"" line, you'll love it for sure!",Mortal Kombat

When it comes to the story tho, this movie falls apart, it's riddled with conveniences and we are left with little to no answers.

1871,tomicalvert,(Almost) Flawless Victory,7,5 May 2021,"It is a Mortal Kombat movie, so nobody expects a cinematic masterpiece but rather a fun martial arts movie with fun fighting scenes and cool special effects. That being said; this movie nails it but it still needs polishing in that area. The fighting is the centerpiece of this movie, but some shots and cuts take that away a bit too often and makes you go from ""holy cow"" to ""what was that?"" a bit too much. This is especially sad since not only the special effects were great but so are the fighting choreographies, and the editing overshadows the amazing actors' work.On the other hand this movie presented some cheesy and awkward moments script-wise, having some noticeable plot holes and basic dialogues, but it also delivers great performances; mainly from Josh Lawson (Kano).In conclusion: when you walk in wanting to watch a Mortal Kombat movie you know what you're going to get. And while this movie needs some polishing to be done in its editing and writing in its essence is actually a great movie... or rather a... Flawless Victory!",Mortal Kombat
1872,kirianmadden,Now I Know Why They Released the First 7 Minutes Ahead of Release,3,27 April 2021,"I keep reading about how fans are actually impressed with how this movie portrayed ""Mortal Kombat."" My first thought is that from an average moviegoer aspect, this movie is bad, but from a fan aspect, this movie is worse. The first scene gave hope for an enjoyable film, but as soon as we are introduced to the newcomer protagonist, Cole Young, the film descends into disaster...Before I tear apart this film, here is what I enjoyed about it: The first scene; I don't know what happened to the rest of the film because the first scene had great fighting and a good introduction to Scorpion and Sub-Zero. Costume Design for many characters was great. Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Sonya Blade, and Kabal looked exactly as I would imagine them. Kano was also actually a pretty enjoyable character and seemed like the only one who fit into their role.To start the bad, this film has absolutely no development. These beloved characters are presented with no background to make the viewer care at all about them, something that the director promised to include. All that is stated about Jax and Sonya is that they were in the military together. Liu Kang seems like a nothing more than a Hogwarts upperclassmen the whole movie and Raiden was just a grumpy Gandalf.All of these characters are severely underused while the film directs its focuses on the bland and pointless Cole Young, a completely original character that is about as original as Snakes On A Train. Cole Young's screen time takes up 80% of the movie and somehow all we manage to learn about him is that he is a fighter and he has a wife and kid. When the untrained, unskilled protagonists fights Goro, a 500-year Mortal Kombat Grand Champion, he finally earns the power of Plot Armor, and defeats him with ease.The casting, acting, and dialogue do not help the characters one bit and the band of protagonists make this film seem more like Power Rangers than Mortal Kombat.In regards to the plot, there barely is one. Character development is sacrificed across the first act to explain ""Mortal Kombat,"" the tournament that DOESN'T HAPPEN. The second act doesn't exist and the third act is a sloppy mess of who cares at this point.As I began to realize the film wasn't going anywhere in regards to plot and characters, I began to look forward to some enjoyable action like what I had seen in the first scene. Man was I fooled. The fighting in the rest of the movie was unsatisfying and hard to watch. The choreography was very slow and predictable. The editing was sloppy and choppy, making each shot look like something else was happening. The CGI was awful in the last half of the movie. The whole film feels feels like if the CW could be gory.In all, I found this film more insulting than fun. Just can't understand how a die hard fan of the franchise can believe that this film gave justice to the content. Whoever led this project at the studio just had beyond horrible decision making, because this film could have easily been what fans deserved.",Mortal Kombat

I don't know why they thought that we'll push the the narrative around the tournament, but there will be no actual tournament. That was a big disappointment, and Kano character was absolutely annoying. The main character wasn't annoying, but he was like not an actual hero.

The only good things about this film that I can think of is Sub-zero and Kano. They're the most developed and grounded characters and the only characters who actually feel like the characters from the game. This film is clearly made by an amateur and needs tons of rewriting!

1884,immortaldreamentertainment,Back to the NetherRealm with you!,2,19 April 2021,"So, I am a huge fan of Mortal Kombat, and I was super excited to hopefully see a take on Mortal Kombat that went all out with it's violence and gore while also giving a more coherent version of the original game's synopsis. So... does it do that?Not exactly. While some of the fights are pretty decent, most of them feel badly choreographed, edited, and/or just slow. The actors do the best they can with a very weak script, but it isn't enough to save the movie. We're barely given any chance to get to know some of the characters before they became Earthrealm warriors, and it felt very rushed. The standouts here are namely Josh Lawson as Kano and Joe Taslim as Sub-Zero. Josh is the only character whose personality really stuck out for me, and Joe Taslim does a great job when he's given time to shine as Sub-Zero.So, onto some light spoilers. While the Mortal Kombat Tournament is mentioned to be happening, it is not featured in this movie. This movie is about Shang Tsung sending several of his warriors to kill Earthrealm's champions before the actual Mortal Kombat tournament happens because of a prophecy that threatens Outworld's victory. This doesn't work because the Elder Gods could (and should) disqualify Outworld for that, right?I wish.The movie mainly centers around the new character, Cole Young, getting tossed into the fray of this conflict between Outworld and Earthrealm after Sub-Zero attacks him. He's pretty much like most video game protagonists: a blank slate with the emotional investment of a rock. Great for video games, bad for movies. Lewis Tan does his best, but he's given hardly anything to work with here. There is a ""surprise"" reveal for his character that I won't spoil, but the movie is about as subtle as a brick going through a window about it. And when this reveal is all you have for the character, that's not a good thing. He doesn't do nearly enough for the movie to earn the climax of his character arc.Kano for me was the best part of the movie, since Josh Lawson seemed to have the most fun with his role. If you aren't familiar with Mortal Kombat, Kano is a member of a mercenary organization known as the Black Dragon that Jax Briggs and Sonya go after. Much like many of the characters, he's just there to be a part of the upcoming tournament with little to no reason as to why aside from his dragon brand. Movie doesn't even bother explaining why he has it.Speaking of Jax and Sonya, they are in this movie. Honestly not really sure why, they do about as much as Cole. Jessica does the best she can as Sonya, but she ends up having pretty much the same role as Bridgette Wilson in the 1995 movie. Jax... exists I guess. He kinda feels tacked on with no reason for being there. Again, the movie doesn't use them to their full potential.Raiden plays pretty much the role of EarthRealm's protector as usual, but like many of the other characters, he doesn't really do much outside of trying to protect the EarthRealm warriors against the Outworld ones. Which is kind of dumb considering what he does at the end of the movie to help wrap things up. I like Tadanobu Asano as an actor, but he doesn't have that commanding presence that I feel Raiden should have. It didn't feel very memorable. At least with Christopher Lambert and even James Remar, they did have memorable qualities to them. This is likely due to either bad directing, a bad script, or just a miscast.Kung Lao was pretty cool when he was allowed to do stuff. Max Huang did his best with what he was given, but as with many of the other characters, he isn't given enough. With Liu Kang on the other hand, I didn't find him interesting at all. He has probably even less personality than Cole. At least with Robin Shou in the 1995 movie, he had some actual personality and charisma to him.Sub-Zero and Scorpion (Joe Taslim and Hiroyuki Sanada) have sort of a changed up backstory in this movie. It's still the same, but with a couple of small differences. I'm not sure if Sub-Zero is actually Quan Chi or the real Bi-Han at the beginning, but the movie never gives any indication it wasn't Bi-Han. The two of them are the ones who have the best fight scenes in the movie, which you see in the trailer. The beginning of the movie features this backstory, and it's a great setup for the rest of the film. Unfortunately a majority of the movie fails to deliver on that hype.Shang Tsung is very unmemorable. Chin Han seems to be attempting to do a very stale impression of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and it only made me wish they had gotten Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Shang Tsung again. His costume is bland, and he pretty much looks like every other stereotypical oriental age Asian villain ever.The Outworld warriors are super tacked on, with the only one with any actual personality being Kabal. And that's only because he has plenty of speaking lines. He also looks pretty cool.Reptile shows up and... well yeah that's pretty much it. He's pretty much in the movie just to die. It isn't even a cool action scene either. At least the 1995 made Reptile's fight badass. In this one he shows up, attacks the characters, and gets killed in like 90 seconds. But he isn't that huge of a character anyway so it's whatever.Mileena stans are going to be super angry with how Mileena is handled here. There is no explanation as to who she is or where she comes from, and Kitana isn't even so much as mentioned in the film so it confuses me as to what exactly Mileena is here? She's kind of just there to be a henchwoman for Shang Tsung.Goro shows up in the movie because... he's a popular boss character I guess? But literally he just shows up out of nowhere with no explanation, and he's about as useful as Reptile. I don't even think he's the long running champion of Mortal Kombat in this, as he's the first one to actually go toe-to-toe in an actual to-the-death fight with Cole. If he is still supposed to be the reigning champion of Mortal Kombat, why did Shang Tsung risk bringing him out for this?Ugh.Nitara and Reiko are there. Except Reiko is just a dumb brute with a hammer, and Nitara is... just there. She barely even does anything.Characters like Johnny Cage and Kitana are not in the movie but Johnny is mentioned once, likely to bait a sequel. Which makes me ask why not just put Johnny Cage into the movie?Also the movie attempts to explain how the characters have powers through means of ""Arcana"", which is kind of like hidden superpowers they unlock if they have dragon brands on their bodies. Think of it like the hidden powers the characters from ""I am Number Four"" have except done worse. It can explain why characters like Kung Lao can teleport and Liu Kang can use fire from his body, but it isn't even needed for other characters like Jax, Kabal, Kano, and Sonya. Like why not have them use the technology they have in the games?But here's what everyone REALLY is going to watch the movie for, the fatalities right? How good are the fatalities? Are they MK11 levels of gory?Kinda? I guess?The fatalities do their jobs, but aren't that creative. They are mostly fatalities we've seen a ton of times, and while that's perfectly fine in some cases, it just feels like something they tacked on to get butts in seats. I kind of understand why they couldn't get too gory, because it would've caused the film to get an NC-17 rating, so I won't harp on it too much. However, Scorpion (obviously) uses his toasty fatality at one point in the movie, and the way it was done was so lazy, it actually made me mad. Like how do you screw up something that could look so awesome with today's technology?The music, just like the characters, is pretty much just there. The composer doesn't have a lot to work with since there aren't a lot of different high paced action scenes, but typically whenever there is, he usually resorts to an orchestral version of Techno Syndrome. Look, I love Techno Syndrome as much as everyone else, possibly even more. But at least in the 1995 movie some of the best fights had memorable music. Like how an instrumental version of Control was used for Reptile vs Liu Kang, or even Congo Fury for Jade vs Liu Kang in Annihilation.But the movie isn't high budget right? It did have a budget of around 50 million. So maybe that was part of the reason for many of these choices, right? Well, the original Mortal Kombat movie did most of this better with a budget of 18 million, which adjusted for inflation comes out to a budget of a little more than 31 million. So that isn't an excuse.This movie feels like more of a prologue/prequel for a better Mortal Kombat movie, and feels like if Mortal Kombat Legacy was made into a movie. It pretty much sets up a sequel with the actual Mortal Kombat tournament, which I feel is what this movie actually should have been about. There's plenty of fanservice in the movie that will cater to longtime fans' nostalgia, but nostalgia should not take the place of plot and good character development/writing.I'll give plenty of praise to the marketing team for managing to pull off this amount of hype for this movie, they clearly did their job. But the filmmakers just couldn't pull it off. The actors did the best with what they had to work with, but even they couldn't save a weak script.As an MK fan? I am very annoyed by this movie. I was either bored or angry with many of the choices made. Do I think it will anger general audiences who know nothing about Mortal Kombat? Probably not. My best guess is they'll either be confused or bored.The acting, VFX, and CGI is better than Annihilation at least. But that's like saying Doom (2005) is better than Doom Annihilation. It's true, but it's not saying much.Anyway... I'm just so disappointed in these filmmakers right now. If this does get a sequel, I hope it's treated with more competence. But I'm not holding my breath.",Mortal Kombat

I was completely impressed with some fight scenes and fatalities. But, there are some drawbacks that prevents me from giving the max score to the movie.Most of the fight scenes were quite short, I didn't have enough time to enjoy them.Sometimes I felt a lack of scenery. It was also difficult to understand how much time it took to train newcomers in the Raiden temple. Why not to describe the temple in a more interesting and a living way? I love how the city was shown in Mortal Kombat Conquest. It had residents and their own events.Starting from the second half of the film, events were happening too fast with a lot of sudden transitions!I completely didn't like the moment when the Raiden's team were deciding who and with whom should fight and they began the fight immediately (e.g. Jax vs Reiko).I also didn't quite like some of the characters, but this is too subjective, so I won't write about this here. But I just wanna mention that I wasn't able to completely comprehend the power of Cole Young. It looks a bit not a Mortal Kombat style, but the actor played his role well.Overall, I think the movie is definitely worth watching, but it's not ""a flawless victory"" and the film lacks of timing a bit.

The animation, it's just great, smoothly, btw the blood from beginning feel a bit too much and fake.Not much talking, even when Shang Tsung (not sure it's correct name) blah blah blah spoils at the end and Raiden sent him away immediately.The ability I impress most from Sonya Blade, I just so cool and strong, the one from Liu Kang also cool but only at the end with the dragon but looks like it's the ultimate.What I don't like:
As the title, I feel Raiden has too much power and hacking, he can build the thunder wall which is inaccessible, he can send anyone to any place. Why don't he just send 1 enemy to the group, so that can kill him easily, and also he can send the group to the middle place that is inaccessible from enemies.Shang Tsung killed Kung Lao just so easily, I prefer Kung Lao would have been killed by Sub Zero.Main character Cole is a bit boring, but it's ok, it's good that he is just like someone else but can connect everyone.Scorpion come back from the hell? And Sub Zero was killed in unfair by Scorpion + Cole even he played so fair I would say, btw he is just too young.The queen with the wing is just ugly, quite sick and week, I thought she has cancer.Looking forward to see the next part.",Mortal Kombat
1936,sevenswubbles,Superb.!,10,25 April 2021,"What I loved most about this film was the character development, especially Kano's character development.At first I was really confused: ""Wait. Kano's one of the good guys? What's going on here?"" Then he finds his arcana by drawing on his anger, which speaks to his intemperance and why he shouldn't be a good guy. Contrast this with how Cole and Jax find their arcana: Cole needing to save his family's life; Jax needing to save Sonya. In a way, Kano finds his arcana through division: Kung Lao and Liu Kang make him livid; Cole and Jax, on the other hand, find their arcana through a need to save the lives of the people they care about. Of course, Kano turns out to be a traitor, which explains everything and lends to a seeming overall message of the film of how important it is to stick together, particularly if you think about how Cole's idea to defeat Shang Tsung and his minions was to divide them.Then there is Raiden giving Cole Hasashi's dagger, which to me was really important because it meant that Scorpion didn't just come out of nowhere and it again lent to this message of the importance of family and bloodlines. Kano was introduced in chains, a prisoner, which speaks to isolation and not having such important relationships. By having him be a turncoat, the film makes sure the audience knows why he deserved to be a prisoner and why he is still pretty much alone throughout. That Kano was introduced in chains can be connected to Scorpion using chains (albeit headed by spares): Kano is bound up by chains, a character who can't trust anyone; Scorpion uses chains as an extension of his body, a character triumphantly survived by his bloodline. Again, there is a clear distinction between these good and evil characters and what it means to be each of them (alone when you're evil, but having family when you're not). (There is even a sense of division in his (Kano's) short conversation with Kabal, as Kabal insists that he doesn't work for Shang Tsung, but with Shang Tsung--there is tension there, which again lends itself to division.)The story and character development both did justice for the fight scenes which are obviously necessary to any Mortal Kombat film.

I had high expectations for this movie wanting to see a Mortal Kombat that never happened. It was all about annoying the hell out of each other and find their ""arcanas"" on the way. Some of the fight scenes look like a slow-motion movie one can actually ""count the dance steps"" of the scene. I've seen Asian movies with a lot better stunts actions...heck, Chuck Norris looks superb in his action stunts compare to these actors.The only worth fight scenes are those of Sub-Zero vs Scorpion, Kung Lao vs Nitara & Liu Kang vs Kabal. Don't get me started with the MC Cole...O-M-G...W-T-H with this character?!!! Weak, weak, weakest characters of all, awful acting, looked like an afraid puppy all the time not knowing what the hell to do since he was mot able to find his ""arcana""...he wasn't even really trying! Really shallow character and the worse acting...I mean there were others but this guy get the prize!Thanks but no thanks! I'll stick with the game since I'll know it won't disappoint me. If you don't mind bad acting and all over the place-no Mortal Kombat tournament then don't mind my review, keep scrolling and go watch the movie. If you're watching on HBO then is not bad, saved you pricey movie tickets and popcorn. Peace out!",Mortal Kombat
1945,gavin_birks-45997,Amazing trailer! Barely satisfactory as a film,5,6 May 2021,"After watching the trailer months back i was so hyped up for this. Bar the addition of Cole Young it looked incredible!Months on and finally available to watch this on Amazon Prime i was buzzing! Unfortunately, this did not hit the mark.Ive been a MK fan for years, playing the games and watching the original movie and i have to say, if the original had more gore it would have surpassed this one.Pros to this movie -Bloody and on the mark with fights/fatalities
Scorpion/Sub Zero scene was incredible
Actors fit their charactersCons -Cole Young should not have been a character. So many to use and Lui Kang being the focal point of the original film and games should have stuck.Characters died way too quickly
Felt like it was just building up too a sequel
Poor acting (Mainly Lewis Tan/Cole Young)
Orginal movie storyline was way better in my opinion
No tournament
Lui Kang underusedIts a real shame because this could have and should have been amazing. The trailer i feel created too much buzz.Get rid of Cole's character and again, this is a far better movie. And his power was poor at best. I mean, a long sleeved shirt, really?!Id honestly not pay to watch this.

1947,aloofalien-54367,This is the best they could do?!,2,23 April 2021,"Seriously, what the heck was this?I mean, the story can be described as lackluster at best, this isn't even about the Mortal Kombat tournament, it acts almost as a prequel for the first tournament. Little to no explanation is given to how things actually work, and who exactly the characters are supposed to be. If you're not familiar with the game lore to begin with, you'll probably be either confused, or you just won't care/Speaking of characters, they are paper thin, with the exception of Kano, who gets any sort of dimension to him. The protagonist, Cole Young, inserted forcefully as a kind of a ""fish out of water"" audience surrogate, is as generic and bland as they come. If they were going to sideline the actual supposed protagonist Liu Kang in favour of someone, they could've at least made an interesting character.Speaking of Liu Kang, and without meaning to offend anyone, the performance by. Ludi Lin is a story onto itself. I don't know if it was the direction, the screenplay, or the actor's chops, but I found myself often asking ""Was this really his best take?"" He does look impressive enough physically though, but Robin Shou is sorely missed.Meanwhile, Max Huang, the actor who plays Kung Lao, actually looks like he tries at times but is given next to nothing to do before being unceremoniously killed off.Same can be said for pretty much all the other performances.Having not seen Lewis Tan in anything before, I cannot attest to the man's acting chops, but judging from this movie alone, he is not leading man material at all. I certainly hope it's not an accurate display of his talents, and that he is given better stuff to do in the future. Speaking of talents, he does seem very comfortable in action/martial arts scenes, and does have the looks to be convincing, so that's a plus.Jessica McNamee (Sonya) is just kind of there, and is given a couple of instances to show what she could've done in a better movie.Mehcad Brooks (Jax) is the only protagonist aside from Josh Lawson (Kano) who exudes any semblance of charisma, but, unlike Lawson, is given poor material. Lawson, meanwhile, is spot on an is clearly having a blast chewing the scenery with the great material he's given (why only him is beyond me)There are also actors here that are known to have given good performances in the past like Tadanobu Asano (Raiden), who seems completely unconvincing or disinterested playing such an important and powerful character. Where is Christopher Lambert's campy laugh and quiet menace so easily on show when needed.Same goes for Chin Han who seems completely out of place playing the iconic Shang Tsung, except perhaps in the scene where he kills Kung Lao. No wonder that MK11 brought back the iconic Cary Tagawa, who is now even more missed as well after seeing this.The absolute legend that is Hiroyuki Sanada is criminally underused, and the little time he has on the screen, he steals the entire movie and then some.A pleasant surprise was to me previously unknown Joe Taslim who is just perfectly menacing without being campy or over the top. Too bad he needs to wear the mask with contact lenses for that game-accurate Sub-Zero look, because his performance is all in the face and eyes. He could've easily played Sub-Zero without any of the physical scenes, and it would have been enough to be scary. He really is one of the few overall standouts in the film, and the only villain actually of note.As for the standouts, I've praised Josh Lawson several times already, but I need to once more emphasize just how much head and shoulders above everyone else he is.That's pretty much it. The powers and gore effects were decent mostly, but without the meat and potatoes, gravy doesn't really cut it.As for the core, i.e. The ""kombat"" itself, in the age of The Raid, John Wick and many other notable examples, fight scenes in a movie based on a legendary fighting game really needed to be taken up a notch, or better yet, a whole length in order to measure up.Shame, it really could've been something if they actually tried.P.

(spoilers incoming)1. No need to rationalize everything for the audience. The audience knows the deal already. Certainly no need for a new character (the audience's representative) who isn't miles cooler than tons of existing characters. Instead, add a pinch of humor to the thing. 1995 movie was far from perfect, but it gave us iconic moments like Raiden's ""I don't think so"" or anything with Shang Tsung. Whereas 2021's Raiden and Shang Tsung came off as ''replacements''. That said Kano's writing was good, much funnier than other action films' comic relief characters usually are.2. The editing in the fights must be very light and long. The one core value of a movie like this is choreography, it must be front and center. Bourne type editing takes away the USP.3. Do away with that mediocre forgettable orchestral score! Infuse the fights with some drive, give it some tasteful techno. In some other cases, ethereal ambient (oriental) would have totally worked too. Like during the ancient warriors' clash.4. Scenery lacks in the film. I hope it was a budget constraint which will be eliminated for the sequel.Bonus: 1995's ninja reptile was incomparably cooler than the big lizard here. That was the best fight in the older film in fact.Bonus 2: Goro deserved better.",Mortal Kombat

This movie did not bring any justice to the franchise.It was rushed, very cheesy at times and seemed like a tv series with a very low budget.The opening scene was the highlight of the movie. But everything else was horrible. Kano carried the story from my opinion.I wouldn't ever watch this again and as a fan I am hugely disappointed. Bad script, bad story and no care was taken into consideration.Cool sfx and cgi from a few fatalities are pointless if proper care is not given to the story, character and franchise.Do not waste your time watching this.

Since MK9 the universe has been having quite solid storylines all the writers had to do is copy from there. That's all everybody wants to see, a freaking live action movie based on the MK Tournament.The good part Joe Taslim plays an amazing Sub Zero and Hiroyuki Sanada plays a great Scorpion. If the story would've revolved around the conflict between them more and having the Cole guy as a link on Earth for Scorpion, it would've been actually a very good movie. But instead we have this Cole guy who does not understand why he is there and neither does the public.The dialogs are cheesy but that's what you expect from a MK movie (I mean, come on?!).Fight scenes could've been better created.The characters are spot on to the game characters.I take this movie as being a prequel to the actual tournament.

1978,grnstones,Movie does fans justice,8,10 April 2021,"Was an enjoyable move from beginning to end. Definitely respects the game and game's story and was great to see all these characters portrayed on scene. When watching this, need to remember this is a martial arts movie so the story line doesn't really have that much depth, rather it pushes you from fight scene to fight scene after the initial plot is set up. While great to see all these characters brought to life, am a bit disappointed in the screen time some of the characters got. For example Scorpion, feels like he was just there for the story setup.The fight scenes are great albeit some could have been just a bit longer.SPOILER
The one thing that felt really off for me was that the story's premise was not really based on the tournament but instead Shang Tsung's avoidance of it, so in that sense felt like a missing ingredient in the overall story.In any case. I enjoyed the film and was glad to see if resurrected after 25 years. Respect to the team that put this together, would definitely hope to see more!",Mortal Kombat

The story was complex, too complex, it was messy and jumbled into a mess. There was an arc that was established and jammed down your throat only to be pushed off to the side until the last 20 minutes.Most of the characters are funny, charismatic and shine in #kombat, except for the main character, Cole, who is pressured to be one of the champions for the earth realm but doesn't show any potential until it's convenient.Long story short, MK doesn't feel like a fleshed out film, it seems more like a pilot episode to a greater second episode.Great Kombat, Bad story.

1983,Everlook,"Special effects, only...",6,11 April 2021,"When I find out that the premiere of a film that once became a legend will soon take place, I want to hope that something will be no worse, and maybe even better! However, my expectations are not always met, as it happened with Mortal Kombat (2021). The life of the characters is divorced from the canon of previous videos, the disclosure of the plot is superficial and can be understood only by those viewers who have at least some idea of the story. Thus, we get an allegorical forgery with good special effects. Unfortunately, I attribute such works to ""fast food"", which is created without proper immersion in the script, without the desire to make a movie with meaning. This is a movie for fans of special effects about - battles, shooting, explosions, magic, etc. You come to this movie to get emotions from an intriguing plot, but watch it as you appreciate the work of computer graphics specialists. In my opinion, this is a commercial movie, where they decided to make money on a well-known name. This trait is inherent in many recent films. Praise deserves good graphics, some jokes (at first I thought it was an action movie, then I realized it was more of a comedy) and the idea of continuing the legendary movie. I hope that directors and screenwriters read this site and draw conclusions that the continuation of popular cinema should be treated more responsibly. After all, people don't want to watch prank kallage, even with good effects...",Mortal Kombat

First off the CGI is a lot better, the script is better, and the fight scenes are amazing. Sanada is a GOD. And Taslim as the ruthless Sub Zero was on point. This movie is for fans of the video game and us 90s kids. This is not an Oscar movie, but a pure fun movie for fans. Watch it for what it is. And yes, the Scorpion vs Sub Zero fight was off the hook!",Mortal Kombat

1986,rodrigo-74622,Flawed Victory: A decent action movie - an excellent adaptation,7,13 April 2021,"I think that rating this movie is really painful and I should take a few more watches before actually going for it because it has so much things to talk about. I want to be objective and simple. So I'll just give some random ratings here, and you'll see the struggle I've had to make my own judgement.As a movie: 6,5
As an adaptation: 8,5Cons: plot holes that only MK fans will get, 1h50 (1h40 without intro and credits) was short, there was some weird editing here and there because the movie needed to explain itself to the viewer too quickly, as a result, some dialogues and plot coherence were damaged!Adaptation downsides: Should've focused only on ACT 1 and the Warner team would be happier if they could have done a story about Hanzo and Bi-Han first, instead of worrying too much on the whole Mortal Kombat aspects for its own sake. After all, the whole film is mostly about the two ninjas. Why? When the first act ends, all of a sudden we have Lewis Tan, for the most part, but some of his acting were pretty much careless with his character, and most of the editing with weird cuts were towards his scenes, and then I felt he had some really rushed and unnatural moments, and the movie is already fast paced, so it went on a Kabal's raging flash pacing!!!Still talking about the cons, when you think of it... Forget the first part...
Act 1 Is pure perfection. Simply put!Then, the Act 2 starts and it brings Cole Young: ""The plot in a hurry"", since the movie is rushed from start to finish, he was trying to tell to the great audience and the newcomers alike to MK how all of this works, but he couldn't, he was too busy taking care of his dialogues and his family while doing some raging flash with the story! And, what happened? Cole couldn't help the viewers to understand his role and to entertain us, MK fans. The only thing this character does right is to tell us all how great the others are when compared to him! As an actor, he went pretty decent! As a character, a complete disaster! Sorry Lewis, you've should have been Repitle IMO!Act 3 - The disclosure is pretty much like a series season's finale. When will the second season be released? As a fan, I definatelly keep wondering when we'll see more, but curiosity here has got me hyped as much as it got me wondering what exactly to expect... I want more, but better! MKU is almost confirmed, so please Warner... Take your time!Because, well, they rushed it. Right? Now it's time for James Wan and Todd Garner to take a break and think very very well how they should create new stories on this franchise's universe because, I really do see a bright future for it. Just remove what doesn't work here and everything will be epic in the future! Remember Mortal kombat: Annihalation? They were confident on the box offices when making that movie, and it just flopped... Well, it's not a threat or anything, but gamers when raged can go to Wall Street and literally Gamestop everyone, if you know the recent context! Or make the most downvoted reddit comment ever! EA should know best! Kuddos to EA!Let's get back to the movie and talk about the actors now.Acting score:
Joe Taslim (11/10) > pretty much our Heath Ledger for Sub-Zero! Yes, he will be unbeatable as the most famous Bi-Han for decades to come, the production doubled his importance for MK lore and gave him a greater and stronger purpose, and he nailed whatever they gave him to act for! Thanks to the brilliant director that casted him right away!You might be wondering why is Sub-Zero so sick? Joe Taslim does the greater job here, but that's not all... He is a much more complex character! And part of it, is because of the writter Greg Russo's great care when making it!With this Bi-Han, you will ask yourself as a MK fan... Do we really need Quan-chi? Because, the icy guy here is just too much for Quan-Chi to handle!I am just wondering what Greg Russo can make with his favourite character on a possible sequence, since it's not Sub-Zero, by the slightest... I am not talking who is here, because it's some sort of spoiler. Taslim gave life, Greg Russo gave the soul.Josh Lawson : 9.0 > Well! That was unnespected, Kano! Great acting from this australian actor who I didn't know before. Thanks again to Simon McQuoid for bringing this guy. Replacing Johnny Cage for Kano as a comic relief was the dumbest and yet the smartest move. You trusted this actor to bring it on in a way I've never thought it could actually work! I forgive you for not giving us Cage, now I see you just couldn't do it with so much things going on and then have Jhonny Cage at the same time, this Kano is awesome!I really was surprised by how well Josh and Joe did this! Kano and Sub-Zero are above Sanada's territory here! But that is a compliment for the movie! Sanada is sick, don't get me wrong!!!And...
Hiroyuki Sanada = Max Huang: 8.5 > They both deliver exactly what we see in the trailers, both as Scorpion and Kung Lao. They are pretty much badasses. Of course, Joe and Josh stole the show. But Scorpion and Kung Lao are just here to make it epic too!Daniel Nelson: 7.5 > While we have the best version of Kano for the movies and the definitive version of Sub-Zero (yeah, you've read that right) Joe Taslim is a better Subzero than we've ever had in the games, also! You see, he is a freaking beast! I'm in Kabal section still talking about Sub-Zero!But Kabal is by far the one who got the closest approach to his original look, super powers, and style over substance, but don't be fooled, Nelson's Kabal is pretty nice too, when acting! Is he raging flash in the movie? Hehehe Not so good as Cole Young with the film's plot! Ok. Enough jokes!Jessica Mcnamee: 7.5 > Great Sonya! The actress does a nice job at portraying Sonya, she has some strange line choices not fitting well in two or three scenes mostly due to the flawed editing in some points, but overall, she is way better than her predecessors, and she had some outstanding moments!Ludi Lin, Mehcad Brooks, Chin Han, Tadanabu Asano where actually average and delivered what was told them to do! Mehcad Brooks goes a little beyond as Jax then the rest of the crew, while Chin Han is a pale Shang Tsung, not bad but not impressive as well. It is a shame that Ludi as Liu, Tadanabu as Raiden where just riding somewhere between the not so bad, not so good acting.Sisi Stringer and Nathan Jones where forgettable, I'm sorry Sisi, maybe next time I guess? Thanks the team that made her a proper half tarkatan character, giving her all of her biting glory, because the ""Edenian princess"" in her was just eaten by her other half! I really missed her face veil hiding her mouth, she is not THAT monster! She is cute too... Right? Mileena is a cute monster! Right?No..., in MK2021 she is just waiting to bite someone! She pushed too hard!Hold back Sisi! Holddd back! Be nice!Nathan Jones is by far the worst actor here, even Mel Jarnson who had less time on screen as Nitara did something cooler... Nathan Jones as Reiko is as good as a brainless orc coming straight from any Tolkien's work. This Reiko is so bad, that even Cole's daughter and wife were more interesting on screen! They were basic, but they did a well done basic work when these two were on screen. Yeah, I'm talkin' about Lauran Brent and Matilda Kimber.""It's a birthmark"" - Daughter, Cole's - 2021.""I don't watch your fights!"" - Wife, Cole's - 2021.Moments we won't forget, but for Reiko? Well. The best Reiko scene is a Jax one! Worst actor, worst character, worst characterization.Reptile and Goro were CGI, so there is no acting point here to rank. They were tollerable and well done in visuals and Reptile shines a bit more than Goro when in action, but here is where we talk about comparison with the old MK 1995.Christopher Lambert is a better Raiden. Keith Cooke is a better Reptile, the Big Goro with only voice effects being portrayed by Tom Woodruff, in the first movie is the best Goro and Tagawa is a better Shang Tsung! The music score is also here, but the 1995 version is also more memorable. Why? Nostalgia?No, it is mostly because the random guy screaming Mortallll Kombaaaat shouts more often in the song.These good parts of the first 1995 original movie were nice, and all, but make no mistake...Now let's talk about how good the movie is:Mortal Kombat 2021 is a cool B action movie and a terrific adaptation with tons of fan service and well portrayed characters, ones that you will never forget and you will just love them from the very beggining to the very ending. Plus, we have gore, blood and some of the most iconic fatalities we gamers are used to see in the series.Joe Taslim is hands down, the best Mortal Kombat character ever portrayed, he IS Subzero, he owned the blue ninja suit. Generations will be talking about his role for years to come and Ed Boon and John Tobias will have a hard time trying to top him even when thinking of him for the games because Taslim gave a whole new level for Sub-Zero standards!This might not be a perfect movie, but is by far the best videogame adaptation we've ever had in cinema's history concerning the live action format, and I can safely say: if you were ever in doubt if the videogame movie curse was broken or not before, then you shouldn't be, 'cuz if it wasn't, now you can't be wrong about it! It's definatelly broken now!My favourite chracters in the games always have been: Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Raiden and Reptile!Yes, I might have a little bias when pushing too hard over Ludi, CGI Reptile and Tadanabu Asano when rating... But man! For Kung Lao, it's not the same as for the others... and again...That Kung Lao was insane! As a fan of the character I really enjoyed Max Huang's over the top performances as much as I loved Hiroyuki Sanada, Jessica and Nelson. Sub-Zero and Kano were something special though.Definatelly I'll be watching again!",Mortal Kombat

1994,rrrampampam,Really bad,3,18 April 2021,"I won't take into account CG because in 2021 I cannot be impressed by simply beautify visual effects.Plot and dialogues - simply trash. I know it's an action movie. But it does not mean that you can simply make a scenario consisting entirely of cliche phrases - its toooo boring, no creativity. It feels like screenwriter thinks that viewers are low IQ idiots who need only violent action and nothing more. Get me right - i don't expect complicated philosophy, but it could be just little more interesting. Strange things like: Sub-Zero came to kill the protagonist and it was important to succeed but instead of unexpected and quick attack he makes a huge a loud show so that every one new that they need to run away before Sub-Zero got close to his target. This is only one example - but it is quite indicative and shows that authors camouflage bad plot with bright effects.Overall the story is sadly untalented. Yawn.Personally I didn't like Scorpion's new character. He's kind of good guy here, but I expected to see brutal hell's spawn. He comes out of nowhere - like 'Haha you though I died. But i didnt. Deal with it OK?' - but how, why and so on - make up your own version and it will be better that the whole MK 2021.I believe that this 'masterpiece' is simply profiteering on famous name, just a way to earn money on love of millions people to this wonderful franchise. And if we pay money for the ticket we support this and this will happen again and again and the future.

2001,toddjamessouter,Finally they got Mortal Kombat right!!!,7,21 April 2021,"---- Warning potential spoilers ----I have been waiting for years and years for this.The trailer looked just awesome and actually had accurate portrayals of the characters from the games,I went into the cinema with low expectations to avoid being disappointed (like after watching 'Mortal Kombat: Annihilation' - 1997), but I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed the film.The opening was respectful to the MK mythology and did a great job of setting up the characters of Hanzo Hasashi / Scorpion (Hiroyuki Sanada) and Bi-Han / Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim) as bitter rivals and deadly enemies.The idea of bringing in a new character as the protagonist is an effective way of bringing the audience into the world and mythos of Mortal Kombat. There are a lot of supernatural and fantasy elements in MK, so starting with a more realistic setting makes it more believable and real:Cole Young (Lewis Tan) does a solid performance of the underdog, the everyman; trying to just get buy and support his family. His fight scenes to me also come across as more genuine and believable; because he shows he is really putting in 100% effort in these fights so that he can survive and keep his family safe.The standout performance is Josh Lawson as Kano - absolutely spot on! Great performance and absolutely hilarious (everyone in the audience was cracking up). Very accurate to the character in the games. It's a real shame as he most likely won't be in the sequel, I would love to see more of his character.--- Potential spoiler for the sequel ---The fight scenes with Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim) were incredible, he has so much presence on screen and spot on casting as the villain.There was a hint / clue to his portrayal as Noob Saibot (the ghost of Bi-Han) in the sequel, during the final fight scene, removing his armor and showing the black ninja suit underneath. Foreshadowing his future as a ninja spectre.Please bring back Joe Taslim as Noob Saibot in the sequel!!!Overall really enjoyable move, can't wait to see it again.Bring on the sequel!Pleas bring back Director Simon McQuoid, James Wan as Producer, Hiroyuki Sanada, Joe Taslim, Jessica McNamee, Mechad Brooks, Tadanobu Asano, Chin Han, Ludi Lin and Lewis Tan for the sequel.",Mortal Kombat
2002,joshua_brading,Fan of the game no spoilers,8,21 April 2021,A few changes I didn't like and a few match ups I didn't agree with.However as someone who has played the game and from what we saw with timelines and Kronika in MK11 it's easy to go into this thinking it's another timeline.With that and obviously knowing it's a movie adaption so their going in their direction. Would say I absolutely loved it.The characters felt like they do in the games. The fighting was brilliant.And as a massive scorpion and sub zero fan very satisfied.It's just a great nod to the games and the nailed the feel!.,Mortal Kombat

The character adaptions were great, Kano was hilarious, Sub Zero - one word - EPIC! The special effects and fight scenes were amazing! So much more than I imagined. I hope to see many more sequels and prequels delving more into the amazing and expansive universe of MK and it's characters. Great fun and an entertaining film 😍",Mortal Kombat

Beyond that everything is changed from sub zero and scorpions backstory. Shang Tsung breaking the rules but following the rules. Raiden can't break the rules but does so anyway. Magic has replaced basic cybernetics upgrades and without going on of course they remixed the theme cause techno. 11 games of lore and history and the director says f×#k u.,Mortal Kombat
2008,dnicholls-52358,A childhood relived,8,22 April 2021,Great movie with great acting. Josh Lawson as Kano-great casting choice. Was as funny as he was ruthless. Seeing the blood and gore in fatalities as we saw in the games was a good addition of the originals.Only things I didn't like was was Chin Han as Shang Tsung and the way they tried to modernize the Mortal Kombat theme. I feel Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Shang Tsung from the original movie was better.,Mortal Kombat

2010,mikelwpan-16101,Quite disappointed after the hype!,5,22 April 2021,"My overall impression was very mediocre. I was quite hyped about the movie going in, but came out disappointed. I would of given it even lower marks if not because I am a Mortal Kombat fan.Honestly, I think they should of just made a movie about Scorpion vs Subzero and include a few other casts like Kung Lao and Liu Kang and build the MK universe out this way (kind of like Marvel). Instead I thought they tried to fit as many characters as possible and rushed the story lines. There was no point of having Kabal, Kano, Mileena, Jax, Goro, Cole Young, and Sonya Blade. Everything just felt rushed.That being said, some of us go there just for the action and i guess it is ok. IMO one about MK is that it actually has a lot of story to talk about. IMO it needs another reboot.",Mortal Kombat
2011,flavioribeiropeople,Do yourself a favor. Watch the 95 MK.,5,6 May 2021,"This movie was made for ""new fans"" who know nothing about this franchise.The plot is ridiculous. The pace also.

So this was my dream come true! I really want more movies in the future!",Mortal Kombat
2014,orwellgz,Now thats a Reboot WELL DONE,9,23 April 2021,MK21 improves on every aspect and delivers some amazing fight scenes. The characters were polished enough to stay true to the themes. Will be desperately waiting for a proper trilogy to be executed.,Mortal Kombat
2015,dymondtika,"Creative storyline, better acting/effects than original, but where's Johnny Cage?!",6,23 April 2021,"I do appreciate the creative storyline of this adaptation but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't upset that they replaced Johnny Cage with this Cole character. He just seems out of place throughout the entire movie. I am happy that the acting is better this time around with the inclusion of some of the cheesiness of catch phrases and fatalities. Kano's character was awesome and really well acted. There was a lot of jumping around scenes which was odd to me and the movie seemed a bit rushed through. It's definitely made for people who have played the video game and are familiar. To someone who isn't, it probably would just seem like a weird, all over the place fantasy movie.",Mortal Kombat

2017,pkfsdnxqzr,"Cool, but not Mortal Kombat",4,23 April 2021,"It started great, but then it took a weird twist by adding unknown elements to MK. The story progression was a bit lackluster and we seriously had to wait until the last forty minutes for any real fighting? Characters were great in some aspects. Kano? Brilliant. Kung Lao? Almost spot on. Liu Kang? 3/10. Slow, wimpy, weak. Anyone who's ever played MK knows Liu Kang's the opposite. Lot of big hype, but didn't deliver. Two stars for the actual combat, two for the characters. Story felt longer than was needed for all of that ending. Honestly thought they were just going for an intro movie and were plotting a second movie after introducing the cast but... Man. I'm worried this's going to flop and we'll have to wait another decade for a decent MK movie. Worth a watch, but not memorable.",Mortal Kombat
2018,vqrstd,Very disappointed,3,23 April 2021,"I've been waiting for this for over 20 years. Both 90s movies were better than this one. So was the Legacy series, hell, even Conquest & Defenders of the Realm were better than this. Acting was horrible, plot was horrible, low budget, cheaply made movie. The only good thing about this movie was Joe Taslim, if they make a sequel, which would be shocking since this first one was so bad, Taslim needs to come back as Noob Saibot. Kano was okay but he died, and Johnny Cage was teased for the sequel. I can't get over how bad this movie was overall. It's very hurtful. Thank you Warner Brothers!",Mortal Kombat

2021,aaronandresen,Was almost moved to tears by this movie,10,23 April 2021,"I was born in 1985. I grew up with video games. I've always known the failure stereotype that surrounds video game adaption to movies, because let's be real: they've been horrid.I am beginning to finally see hope for the industry as a whole. First, Sonic the Hedgehog came out, and I was absolutely blown away by how well they captured the spirit of the character after listening to the fans' feedback. Now...This.I cannot put into words how amazing this movie was on so many levels. The lighting, the acting, the fight chorography, the brutal gore, the cinematography, and more than anything the feel of the movie as a whole. It just worked and it was done well - no, not well - perfectly.All of the idiots complaining about Johnny Cage being left behind got a giant middle finger from the producers at the end of this movie and it made me smile from ear to ear. If it hasn't become clear by now, the people in charge of this new movie franchise breathe Mortal Kombat and have a passion we've never seen before for the series in terms of moviemaking. Combine that with a solid cast, who unbelievably to me was put so well together (Kung Lao, Jax, Kano and Kabal struck me as particularly amazing) and a big budget movie studio's money coffers behind them has me giddy about the future of this series.This movie actually made me feel sad for characters. Watching Jax come to the realization that he had no arms after he came to actually moved me in a way I didn't expect. It brought human emotions to a fantastical and fictional story that (let's be honest) is pretty over-the-top.I used to be a pretty good writer, but I didn't take any time to be poetic or to even proof this or really put any grammatical thought into it. I've used IMDB for like 15 years and I created an account for the first time ever just to review this movie at a 10 to offset all the lames who can't appreciate the lover letter that is this movie and because if one good review causes another person to support this WONDERFUL MOVIE and we get another one.... IT WAS WORTH IT!Also, you know they're bringing back some of the people that were killed in this movie. It even alludes to it when Shang Tsung takes their bodies/souls at the end.",Mortal Kombat
2022,shreyambajpai,ONE OF THE BEST VIDEO GAME ADAPTATIONS,6,23 April 2021,As a movie it was meh. But as an adaptation damn it was good. It is a great delight for the fans and was able to capture the gore of the mortal kombat that we know. Most of the characters were accurate. A 8/10 adaptation but might not attract audiences who are not familiar with the franchise. Overall it's a 7/10. Hope to see more of this :),Mortal Kombat

2024,mrbhollis,I liked the beginning...,3,23 April 2021,"The beginning and character development for the heroes is cool, but then all of the sudden it's pandemonium everywhere. There was no tournament, it's just chaos all over the place with 5 or 6 fights going on in different realms at the same time... and no real satisfaction in any of the victories. They only develop back story on one villain, so unless you're a die-hard fan you really don't care about any of the match ups. And I grew up playing Mortal Kombat back in the early 90's in the arcades, so I expected a lot more fantastic fatalities in the movie. Especially given the level of detail that the latest MK 11 game has shown us.If this is supposed to be a prelude to something better I guess it's an ok start. They'll need to step up the cinematically and gore in future movies though.",Mortal Kombat

Cut to scene which leaves an opening for a sequel.I love the Mortal Kombat franchise, so I hope the do a sequel. BUT...

You pay for great script writers and CGI and they weren't given much. So with what was given this movie was awesome. They set up the base or the foundation of the MK universe. Only negative i have is the character of cole young. Lewis tan was great i just hope his character does not become alice of the resident evil series.

The complete story of Mortal Kombat is a convoluted one so I'm not quite sure what people were expecting out of an hour and 40ish minutes. Was there a lot of character background? No. Was there enough to understand who the main characters where? Yep! Quite honestly I don't need a full fledge story on 15 characters. On top of that this is an adaptation of a video game known for fighting.Josh Lawson(Kano) shines by far over everyone else. The blood and gore can get a little cheesy. Tadanobu Asano(Raiden) and NG Chin Han(Shang Tsung) were pretty sub par. Other than that the movie delivers exactly what it was supposed to. High action, great fights and complete resonance with the video game. Personally, I liked the movie and the fact that I didn't have to follow the long twisting confusing story and could just enjoy the movie for what it is. For the reviews complaining that there wasn't enough story understand that this wasn't made for a one off. It was designed and intended to be a franchise.

The cast were all so spot on in their portrayals of each character, they were exactly how they are in the games.You do really need to know a basic background about this movie before watching it, as it doesn't leave you any time to figure things out! I would advise non-fans of the video game to do a wee search beforehand on the basic story.It's still an amazing action movie if you're not interested in the backstory, just turn off your brain a bit & don't expect your question answered too well.The guys behind the movie have made it for the fans, so that is why you're expected to know a certain amount of the lore.Only thing close to a ""bad thing"" I can say that is wrong with this is that it could have been longer! But to be fair, if it had been 4 hours I would probably have still wanted it longer! I understand they are setting up a good few sequels (sooooo happy about that) so they didn't want all their eggs in one basket, so to speak. They will be spreading all the different stories out over a few movies I reckon & I cannot wait for it.As a fan, this was everything I had wanted in a movie adaptation. The gore, the ACTORS, the fight scenes, the story - it was all perfect.

I now can happily be cut in MK3 for the Sega or MK9 on PC. And when I learned about the existence of a film adaptation of this wonderful fighting game, I immediately decided to watch it. And you know, this movie captivates from the first seconds. As soon as they start to play the first chords of the legendary melody, you just blows the tower. The plot, though rustic, but quite decent. The characters are transferred quite reliably, though some of them are inserted into the film only for the sake of fan service, such as Scorpion or Sub-Zero. The plot revolves around the main trio of the series - Liu Kang, Sonya Blade and Raiden, who must defeat all their enemies and save the world. A little trite, but it is more than overlapped just beautiful battle scenes. The main villain of the film Shang Tsung performed by Chin Han came out very charismatic and memorable. In a whole the film highly good, albeit not without shortcomings. And separately I will allocate Goro whose model was made so that sometimes there was a feeling of its full realism. From me movie 10/10.",Mortal Kombat
2062,emoyxa,Great movie,10,24 April 2021,This is a good movie. It has a lot of action. It has great acting. It also has a great story line. 6.7 is underrating it. I give it 10 out of 10. This is a great movie. See this movie.,Mortal Kombat
2063,lilski-16194,OMG WHY I RANKED IT 5/10!!!,5,24 April 2021,You can tell it's a low budget movie from start to finish. Tbh watching this feels like they got a some random people off the street to cosplay as mortal kombat characters instead of the real thing. The acting is mediocre and the outfits don't look that good for a movie and you can tell they cut some parts out the movie to make it shorter because some parts of the movie just skip and don't make sense at all. Sure if you saw these outfits on the street it would look cool but for a movie just no. You might be thinking I'm critiquing the little things. But I've seen fan made productions way better than these official releases. That's a dam shame that fans can make better movies and gaming content than the official creators. You can literally see the cgi like they almost barely tried to make it look real. The fighting is ok but unacceptable for an official movie. The lack of fighting sounds makes it sound less up to any movie standards and it feels slow and lacks almost any amazing moments. They would fight like regular and then switch to cgi moments it wasnt mixed together like no real combos or anything like not giving it any mortal kombat feel. But it's still mortal kombat and there were some cool parts which is expected from the upgraded cgi but Tbh I would much rather watch the older movies in the 90s than this. It has much better quality and acting and everything besides the cgi. But the 90s movies were so much better than this one that it doesn't even matter about the cgi. Anyways if you care more about visuals than quality I have no doubt you'll enjoy this movie to an extent but if you have standards then you will be disappointed by this movie because it could've been way better mainly because the only thing the original movies lacked was cgi and now that it's here everything else sucks.,Mortal Kombat

2065,uhmymc,Best Movie I've Seen In A Long Time,10,24 April 2021,"You're going to read my title and wonder what institution for ""special"" people I'm locked away in, but I will explain everything. I'm 32 and remember the original arcade game, as well as the releases for 16-bit gaming systems. I was 18 or 19 when I saw this movie. I believe I heard the soundtrack first, because I was getting interested in electronic music at that point and still find Orbital's songs on the soundtrack to be very good. I was hanging with my 14 year old nephew and we were looking for a movie to watch on cable, so we came across Mortal Kombat. I lied and told him it was a good movie and it was free, so we figured what the heck? My brother joined us as he had never seen it. We laughed nonstop through this movie. Johnny Cage's moves were horrendous and it's not like the character required a good actor, which they didn't get anyways, so they could have paid a bit more for Jean Claude Van Damme and gotten a person with some acting experience as well as a person to pull off the martial arts believably. The guy who played Kano was horrible, as were his moves. The same goes for Sonja. The director butchered her patented hand standing move where she grabs a guy by his head with her legs and flips him over, or flings him through the air. Cables would have fixed this, but they didn't use them for that scene, however they did the same move with Liu Kang later in the movie. Goro is also hilarious to watch, and when he is supposed to do the move where he grabs an opponent and pummels him, the viewer is left with only this awkward sequence where Goro pounds the guy once due to the limitations of the animatronics involved. Reptile CGI looks OK in some parts, but really bad in others. At one point I started cracking up because this movie was starting to get ridiculous. The boat (sailboat) had bilge pumps and a see through floor built into the hull and I don't really picture Shang Tsung heading down below to observe sharks, coral, or manta rays. Scorpion and Sub Zero were on the same side, despite them being enemies. Towards the end I began laughing so hard I was crying, because Rayden's (Lambert) dialog was just too ridiculous for anyone to take it seriously. Rayden also does not fight in the tournament, despite having cool powers, and Lambert who has done action before. Some scenery and sets look good, while others are not so good. The scene on the deck of the boat was horrible, including the stars which looked like Christmas lights or holes poked through black paper in front of some lights. Would it have killed the producers to find a real boat and film at night? Acting was less that something I would expect in a 3rd grade play. Liu Kang was by far the most talented fighter in this production. Story made no real attempt to stick to the video game, which is surprising, because it's written by the game's creators. The stunt/fighting choreography was less than I would expect from a theatrical release and I'm being polite. With all that being said I still had a great time watching this movie, as it made me nostalgic, gave me some quality time with my nephew, and I've never laughed so hard, even at a comedy. There's no shame in having a really bad movie that people will still watch years later. I'd rather watch this movie than some pretentious movie where everything is supposed to be so artistic. I will remember this movie like my parents remember the B movies from their past. 20 years from now I will watch this, but I wouldn't watch inception, or The Dark Knight. I wish they had gotten better writers for this movie. I also would have paid a bit more to get guys like Seagal, Van Damme, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, or any other host of actors who could have pulled it off at that time, and they wouldn't have demanded the money actors demand today. There was a scene where Johnny Cage walks off the set of a movie and his director is yelling for him to come back. The director kind of looks like Spielberg and my sister in law asked if it was him. Everyone was laughing and told her that Spielberg wouldn't be in the same time zone as the filming locations just in case...",Mortal Kombat

As a lover of the game and a fan of the 1995 movie from my childhood I was leery of this flick coming in.

2071,mdennisart,Wanted to like it...,1,24 April 2021,"There were three female characters, not including the useless and forgettable wife and daughter of the main character used only to further his character arc. Mileena has two lines, Sonya could be taken out of the film without affecting the story at all and really only exists as a caricature, and the third woman/demon has no lines besides animalistic shrieking. The main character was completely unnecessary, and all of his achievements felt unearned. The ""climax"" is so unsatisfactory that I asked out loud ""wait, was that it?"". I was so excited for this movie. I wanted to like it so badly. Even if I could ignore the depressing lack of female representation both in the cast and in production, this is simply not a compelling or satisfying movie.

2077,jameilahharvley,So close but no cigar,2,24 April 2021,"The disappointment I felt watching this film was inevitable. Why do you ask? With the name like Warner Bros Studios producing the film, the doubts just automatically set in. You gravitate to the film for the love of the game and the R rating. Hoping that the fatalities and flawless victories were going to be flawless. None the less, WB fell short to hit the mark. When introducing a new character, do so in the game. If I had to thank COVID for one thing, it would be that I didn't waste my time and $30. I was able to make dinner, sit on my couch, and hit the occasional pause button when necessary.

2078,rockyroberts-16308,Suffers From The DCEU,4,24 April 2021,"By that I mean, either the director doesn't really know the lore of all the characters (like Josh Whedon with Justice League) or the studio heads just wanted to shorten the film which left so much of the story out that it didn't make sense (i.e., the way they were screwing Snyder over to make the movie extremely short).Spoiler:This director actually said that he didn't want Johnny Cage to be the hero again - dude, Liu Kang is the hero and Johnny is the comedic relief. Get your lore right. I at least expect the director to understand the lore. Liu Kang was completely nerfed and Johnny Cage was non-existent. Liu Kang losing to Shang Tsuang so easily?

There is little to no build up and then BOOM they are all just fighting, Not actual tournament style, the movie focuses more on Scorpions bloodline as well as the beef between him and Subzero which is cool and all but he and Subzero are not what we recall. Goro looked like he did in the original which was nice but yea the fight scene and way he died, not digging it, it wasn't even Johnny Cage. They didn't even fight out outworld, they jumped all over and it was just...yea noI mean it's an okay movie but compared to the original, doesn't come close, there are somethings that shouldn't be attempted to be remade and this most assured was one of them.

It gets the characters where they need to be, when they need to be there, offers some character development (particularly for Kano, Cole and Jaxx) and doesn't overly get in the way of what matters.If we were judging this purely on being a Video Game movie, i'd give it a 10/10.

When Kung Lao died all of them just stared like in a 3rd rate Bollywood movie. Fighting choreography was lacking. Camera positioning and use of slow mo could have been hugely improved. They tried to cash in on blood and gore, but without good fight scenes it felt redundant. Any of the 3 video game cut scene collection would have far more worth of time. Hate to say it, even the MK movie from the 90s was better than this disappointment.All this without even considering the fact that they had butchered the classic trilogy plot. Raiden spoke English like a native while Shang Tsun spoke English pretty fluently which I decided to selectively ignore for the love of franchise.In a sentence, an iconic franchise gone horribly wrong by trying cash in some quick buck riding on the fame.I won't surprise if they even fail to rake in the investment.

2092,visionelitelouisville,"It's a movie reboot of a video game franchise, what did you expect?",7,24 April 2021,"Don't let the title of this review give you the wrong impression. I rather enjoyed this movie.If you were expecting Oscar winning performances from a load of B-List actors and Hollywood newcomers, then you need to lower your expectations a little. This isn't the box office smash of the year. If you're a Mortal Kombat fan, then you can rejoice in the fact that you're getting exactly what you wanted. A violent, gory, vulgar slugfest that doesn't insult or take away from the Mortal Kombat mythology, along with some campy/corny dialog that you should expect from the MK universe. My wife, who has played Mortal Kombat maybe three times in her whole life even enjoyed this movie.The most controversial decision made for this movie was probably the addition of a new character, Cole Young. I, like you probably were, was very sceptical of this move, but the writers integrated his existence into the mythology, interweaving it with the Hanzo Hasashi bloodline was very well done, very well thought out, and very well executed.Another thing this movie did exceptionally well was inviting people who are unfamiliar with the Mortal Kombat mythos and introducing them the MK world with very little questions as to what is going on. Whether you have played every single game since its conception, or have never played the game before, you will have the same amount of MK knowledge as it partains to this reboot by the end of the movie.When it comes to drawbacks, this movie isn't void of them. If you were expecting a grand finale boss fight scene, you're going to be very disappointed in some way. The ending felt a bit unfinished, for lack of a better term. However, the ending did set up a sequel in a very obvious way. This would be a great thing in a normal world, but we are not living in a normal world right now. With most theaters in many states still closed or extremely limiting the theater capacity, there is no certainty that a sequel will be made. If that is the case, it will make this movie completely unfinished. A perfect example of another reboot that will forever leave us hanging, the 2017 reboot of Power Rangers. Again, a movie that was pretty well setup and executed, leaving us wanting a sequel (even having a post credit scene hinting at one) but underperformed in theaters to its gruesome death, which is a shame because I rather enjoyed the Power Rangers reboot.In conclusion, if your Mortal Kombat wet dream was to have a movie that stays true to the MK mythology and is packed with gory fatalities, then your wish will come true. Just don't over critique this one. It's a movie reboot of a video game franchise. Be glad it even happened in the first place.",Mortal Kombat

It took a slightly different road than the classic lore, but the journey was still as enjoyable as ever.Sure, there was some questionable story pacing at times and I personally would have liked to see juuuust a little more story/character development, but in the end it left me feeling like I was 10 years old all over again ready to spar with my pillows to Techno Sydrome pretending to be Scorpion.If you're looking for a movie to critique, pick apart and decide whether or not it deserves an academy award, then this movie probably isn't for you, but if you're looking for an action packed, fun, violent and even pretty funny 2 hours...Mortal Kombat delivers the way only Mortal Kombat can!!Hopefully we get to see what the future has in store for the franchise moving forward after a very solid launching point.8/10.",Mortal Kombat

The fights while fairy gory, are for the most part low-budget action movie except the Scorpion and Sub-Zero scenes, and maybe the MMA fight.

2102,eviled-42355,Heavy Spoilers NOT Mortal Kombat,1,25 April 2021,"I fell in love with Mortal Kombat with Mortal Kombat 2 and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 when I was about ten years old. This would have been somewhere around 1998. I have played through every mainseries game, watched both movies, and watched the cartoon acress these 23 years now. I say all this because I want the reader to understand my love for this franchise so that they can understand why I hate this movie so much.I hate this movie because this movie is not Mortal Kombat. That's the simplest and most direct way I can communicate this to you. If you asked me to show you one thing that you could walk away from and say that you have a core grasp on what Mortal Kombat is; I would say play through the story mode of Mortal Kombat 2011. That game is very respectful to the original story whilst aslo rebooting it at the same time. It retells the story of the first three games and you'll walk away from it knowing what Mortal Kombat is. I would not recommend you watch this movie to understand what Mortal Kombat is. In fact, I'd recommend you run screaming in the opposite direction of this movie.Why Mr. Reviwer, that sound pretty harsh and mean. What do you mean by these statements? The movie was made with love from people who cared about the games and wanted to provide nothing but fan service to you. You dare spit in their face? Why?Well, let me put it this way. This movie is about a character who isn't a Mortal Kombat character, who decends from a character who never existed in the games, who herself decended from a Mortal Kombat character. Sound generic and stupid? You bet it is! But wait, it gets worse! Because of this long line of bloodline decent that never existed in the games (and thus this bloodline link to these nonexistent characters had no importance in the games) main hero not Mortal Kombat character is destined to disover the inner power this nonexistent bloodline link gives him to fullfill a prohpecy that also, you guessed it, doesn't exist in the games. It isn't even a tournament. It's a pre-fight assisination of characters. Which is also horrible, because we have no atmosphere of a tournament and don't even get to see Shang Tsung's Island.So, at this point, you might be asking; does this movie have anything to do with the games at all? And, the answer, of course, is a resounding, complete, and total no. This is nothing more than a generic cash grab that called itself Mortal Kombat, dressed itself with Mortal Kombat characters, and drenched itself in blood. But, a gorry movie does not a Mortal Kombat story make; when you completely ignore the lore of the Mortal Kombat games.This movie, in all respects, should have been essentually a hybrid of Mortal Kombat 1995 with the Mortal Kombat 1 elements of the story as they were done in Mortal Kombat 2011 (sans the message back in time stuff) with a hard R rating. That's it. Plain and simple.Watch Liu Kang, erm, I mean generic martial arts gary stu be shoehorned into the main character role as he embarks on a quest to Shang Tsung's mysterious island, erm, I mean warehouse. To compete in the great tournament of Mortal Kombat, erm, I mean to try to not be picked off by its fighters before they even get to Shang Tsung's island. There, glimpse the otherworldy Outworld, erm, I mean giant cliff where Shang Tsung sits his throne and talks a lot. Be amazed as Prince Goro battles Liu Kang, erm I mean Johhny Cage, whoops, erm, I mean Gary Stu in Goro's Lair, erm, I mean atop a cliff on Shang Tsung's island, whoops, erm, I mean, exiting a rural barn.Not saying that Mortal Kombat 1995 fallowed the story perfectly either. It doesn't. But, at least it tries to do its best with its PG-13 raiting to squeeze as much of Mortal Kombat's ambience, mystery, wonder, and personality of characters into the rating it had to work with. It brought us Shang Tsung's island, had two amazing Goro fights, and an actual tournament atmosphere.This new movie is not a tournament, does not show us Shang Tsung's island reimagined with modern speciel effects technology, does not fallow a Mortal Kombat character as its main character, and in general does not feel like Mortal Kombat.It felt like a low budget knock off that couldn't afford to build the sets or visit an actual island for filming. So, instead, cooked up this lazy story to try to explain why none of the cool things that happened in the games and the 1995 movie never actually materialize on screen in this movie.It's Mortal Tease. It's Mortal let's ditch Liu Kang and fallow a Gary Stu when pulled out of our butt to be the long lost whatever to Scorpion becase he decended from his non-existent daughter. Yes, Scorpion gets a daughter now. Not sure where she came from. Was never in the games at all. But, he has a daughter now.You know, Gary would have made a much better character as a sort of decedent to Scorpion of he was just Takashi Takeda from Mortal Kombat X. It would have made so much sore sense with the lore and he kind of looks like him.Of all the amazing atmosphere posibilities from the setting of the original game, of all the characters that exist in the Mortal Kombat franchise; this movie has so little respect for that franchise that it instead gives us a Gary Stu, with a contrived past for the sole purpose of connecting him to a character that is actually from the game and matters, and completely sidelines Liu Kang to give us non-interesting Gary Stu's origin story.Because when I think Mortal Kombat, I certainly think of a no-name nobody fighting Goro in what might as well be his back yard; who sucks so bad at fighting he needs saved with an axe. Yeah... totally what I got when I played these games. Who could possible have wanted anything different than this? Goro in his lair or somewhere else cool on Shang Tsung's island? Nah man, Goro in the back yard coming out of a barn.Nitara? The character most fans dismissed so hard that we haven't seen her in a game sense 2007's Mortal Kombat Armageddon on the Wii? That's totally a character out of many fan favorites that needed to be brought back.I could go on, and on, and on, and on. But, the point is this. This game was not made by fans for fans. This game was made for general audiences who know Mortal Kombat is that thing where martial artists fight ninjas and monsters and it's bloody and gory. Or, in short, they had no faith in the lore of Mortal Kombat at all and instead created a generic martial arts gore film because they knew casual audiences don't know the difference between that and Mortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat has a multiple decades long complex lore that rivals many film and movie franchises in its complexity. Amazing characters and world building. But, sadly, none of that is on display in this movie. Instead, we get whoever guy fighting randomly inserted Mortal Kombat character for lack of reason in uninteresting and not game locations.I enjoyed the 1995. I was so happy to learn that all these years later we'd be getting something like that again, but R rated this time. What I got was a slap in the face. As a Mortal Kombat fan, this offends me. This is not fan service. This is general audience pandering. If you don't know the difference, you shouldn't have made this movie.This movie is scoring well, with its intended audience. Too bad that audience isn't Mortal Kombat fans.",Mortal Kombat

That movie literally had a good story line and looked like it was shot in a scenario with so many characters.This version of Mortal Kombat lacked performers and performances. The acting and production of the movie was quite pathetic, truth be told. And except for the 7-10 characters showing up every now and then, it looked like the movie was shot in a private arena where no one else was around except for a few random monks just walking around and going on their own business.Highlight: The only part of this movie that stood out for me was scorpion and sub zero's characters and the story of their rivalry. The first scene of the movie was a master piece which felt like it used up all the creativity, production, writing.

I don't know why he does not have chemistry with other characters. The acting was so flat with no expression.Luckily, the other casts were good, especially the actors who play kano, scorpion, sub-zero and sonya. Kano is so humorous with a thick australian accent. Scorpion has good moves and serious expression. Sub-zero is terrifying with cool blooded expression and scary presence. Last but not the least, Sonya has a charming and strong presence in the movie. However Shang Tsung, Raiden. And Liu kang are just mediocre, not really good. The rest are just okay.The story itself is just so so. Some parts are good, some are bad. The CGI is good, but the fighting choreography is little bit too fast, but overall is good. The costumes are spot on and based on the modern mortal kombat games.

The Great Kung Lao is not even mentioned outside that he is connected with Kung Lao. Now in the movie timeline Liu Kang is actually not Kung Lao (The Great) successor instead he is an orphan (WHAT?!). Jax and Sonya are searching for people wearing mark yes you herd right now everyone that has mark is ""chosen"" no more ""Liu Kang is the chosen one"" now everyone are ""chosen"" and if you kill a ""chosen"" character you take hes/her place wtf?!?! Then Sub-Zero is breaking Jax arms (not Ermac) but Jax wants revenge from..... Reiko?!?! Ahhh final fights are just like Anihilation- ""I choose you"". Kano is no more the Killer of Sonya's partner thats why she isnt hating him that much even working with him. Btw now every ""chosen"" character is now Power Ranger becouse when they get marks they optain superpowers OH CMON WASNT THIS MOVIE SUPOSED TO BE FOR ADULTS NOT FOR KIDS?????????? Give me a break and the actor of Shang Tsung is looking pathetic. Mileena is Black and she is showing before Kitana (witch doesnt yet exist in this timeline a long side Johny Cage).

Ultimately the movie is quite boring and saved by some good comedic timing by one impatictular character. ""Did you miss me baby"".

2139,jwhite-63476,"I came expecting a roster of Ninjas, Gods, and Agents ripping out each other's organs. And that's mostly what I got.",7,26 April 2021,"I have four major issues with this movie. The first off is the dialogue. The use of the F-word is excessive and after about 20 minutes it becomes weightless. I could go with the use of it every 5 minutes, but the amount of (ab)use of the word was unrealistic. The egg roll obscenity scene was so random and the tone changed so awkwardly that it just felt stupid.The second, as most people said, Cole. I was absolutely sure that Cole would become Scorpion as the movie went on. When his impenetrable chestplate appeared, I figured he would get the Scorpion hood and chain later on. And when the real Scorpion appeared, it was really awesome. But it takes away from Cole's already-lacking character. Either have Cole be the true Scorpion, or don't have Cole at all. The entire point of his character is that he's supposed to help the audience get oriented with the lore of the universe, but all he does is get dragged around by his supporting cast and act as a receiver for exposition. It's likely that he'll become Scorpion later on in the series, but that won't be a for a while. Also, the ""Use the Uppercut"" scene with Goro was beyond cringeworthy.Third, the use of a prophecy as a plot device. It's such an old trope and prophecy heroes aren't fun anymore. It's more interesting when an ordinary person subverts a destiny to do something interesting with themselves. The use of the dragon tattoos felt too structural to the plot and the Arcana thing was way too generic.Finally, the characters. They introduce Goro, Reptile, Mileena AND Kung Lao and kill them off really, really fast (As in, within 20 minutes of introduction). At least 4 whole movies are planned for this series. You really couldn't just save these awesome characters for later? Resurrections are very possible but these characters were so underdone that it'll be hard to make them feel like serious weights on the world of Mortal Kombat if they get brought back. And despite Joe Taslim's decent performance and a very special role in the movie's heart, Sub-Zero is once again reduced to a minion of Shang Tsung.But the film really had it's strong points. The acting was good (Although I far prefer Robin Shou Liu Kang to Ludi Lin's) especially for Kano, Sub-Zero and Scorpion. The fight choreography and special effects are amazing. The opening scene is beautiful and brings in two great characters, one of whom will get progressively less great and one of whom will just remain in stasis for the rest of the movie until he shows up in all of his hellish glory for one of the best fight scenes in film history. Frankly, I don't have a problem with the lack of a tournament, since the 1995 Mortal Kombat movie showed us that it's usually difficult to pull off that kind of structured plot. This movie had its flaws, but it really captured what Mortal Kombat is all about: Revenge, fighting, comedy and gore.Although... you know what could have been a better plot? A movie where Scorpion is the protagonist. The movie keeps the first scene from the actual MK movie and then flashes into Hanzo in hell, being instructed by disembodied voices about how he can get revenge on Sub-Zero. Flash forward almost 4 centuries through a montage of Hanzo in intense pain and then he's out of hell, with his spear and his yellow cloak. He joins Mortal Kombat, a legendary tournament hosted and corrupted by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung that the now-immortal Sub-Zero has entered. Hanzo is intent on killing Sub-Zero in the tournament as revenge. Along the way, he bands with some other members of the tournament but shows little concern for them. Throughout the tournament, he grows as a person and finally, in the climax of the movie, the lives of his fellow Mortal Kombat champions are at stake because of Shang Tsung's desire to go and kill several kombatants for their souls, prompting Scorpion to drop his selfish goal for revenge and instead kill Shang Tsung for the greater good. After killing the sorcerer, Sub-Zero attacks Scorpion and is killed as Scorpion unmasks himself, revealing the hell-fueled flaming skull beneath his veil. Then we get a sequel about Liu Kang and Kung Lao fighting in Shao Khan's new Mortal Kombat tournament and one about Sub-Zero (now Noob Saibot) fighting his brother Kuai Lang for the honor of the Lin Kuei. I think that'd be much better, but it's not gonna happen unless the series is rebooted again.",Mortal Kombat

Mortal Kombat is more than just about a tournament. Which in this reboot does not have however that is not a bad thing, but hopefully will get to see if a sequel happens.Now the reason I gave this movie an average rating of 7/10 was because of a certain new character. Which by the way Mortal Kombat games are known for adding new characters. Anyway this one felt kind of weak in the film, not hating on the actor. I thought he was great it's just poor how Cole Young was used in the movie.

2141,jessacryzthel,Mortal Kombat Without the Mortal Kombat Tournament.,5,26 April 2021,"This is Scoprion's Revenge, live-action, version negative 1.0.First Things First:
Mortal Kombat WITHOUT THE ACTUAL MORTAL KOMBAT TOURNAMENT. Thank you for messing up a movie we've been waiting for, for so long, Shang Tsung. Why couldn't you just have ""Let Mortal Kombat Begin?"" You just haaaaad to pre-empt the entire tournament. Someone ought to finish you off and give you a Fatality with a Flawless Victory for ruining this movie with your impatience.Seriously Though:
The Mortal Kombat of 1995 had much more going in terms of storyline. This 2021 version is like an Origins story - more than half the movie was dedicated to the lives of the character(s) (which is a nice attempt at providing depth to the characters), but did not focus on Mortal Kombat itself. The Mortal Tournament practically DID NOT EVEN take place, thanks to Shang Tsung's impatience, which was for me a let-down. Unlike the First Movie in 1995 which actually brought the viewers into Mortal Kombat itself, this entire movie Pre-Empted The Tournament. For this reason it shouldn't even be called Mortal Kombat, but something like ""How Mortal Kombat Got Cancelled"" or ""Mortal Kombat: Scorpion's Revenge Live Action,"" for this generation of fighters.Sonya Blade was amazing though and how she stuck to the fight even if she wasn't among the chosen in the first place. That aside, the storyline could have been so much better. The stakes weren't even felt. Earth could have started suffering attacks for example, with the Elder Gods ""asleep"" - but nooo. So much more could have been done without sacrificing character development. This is a Mortal Kombat Fatality for those who have been with Mortal Kombat since the Beginning.

If you cant handle them don't introduce so many key characters. 9-times champion Goro being killed by some random guy, really? Kabal, Liu Kang, Mileena etc. Deserve a better buildup and character depth.3. JC not being in the movie.2. Joe Cole was unnecessary, boring, pathetic, most unoriginal character ever. It should have been Johnny Cage instead as a main protagonist, like in the 1995 movie.1. Jump-cut fighting. You will not find a single movie enthusiast who likes jump cut fighting scenes. Battle choreography was virtually non-existent (with exception of scorpion vs subzero). Watch Raid, into the badlands, Oldboy, and other Asian movies if you don't know how to shoot it.--Long story short:if you want to compete with Marvel universe you need to do 2 things:1. Involve Ed Boon and other creators who really understand how MK universe works. Because, despite of all fatalities and good stuff, forcing fans to watch Joe Cole and his pathetic family saga for 2 hours is not a fan service.2.

Which falls in line perfectly with the universe and realistic expectations.Critics and those unaware of the franchise, will easily struggle understanding the love that went into this film.There are so many smart and painfully obvious nods to the games, movies and even pop culture gravitas surrounding the series.From a notoriously well known 'cheap strategy' of leg sweeping another player over and over (yes, they did a tribute to even something like this!) all the way to original 'fatalities' and one liners on display...it's clear that the people creating this film had a lifetime love of the franchise at hand.Critics will see it as another seemingly convoluted ultra violent action movie, often filled with tropes...while fans will easily decipher the plot and smile at the many great moments on display.This is a movie for fans, by fans. And I commented executives for allowing such a risk to occur - rather than taking the safe route and appealing to 'everyone'.This is a large and often forgotten part of what makes cinema great - as not everything needs to be art nouveau or crammed with masterful acting and deep storytelling.But films that take true risks and appeal to a niche audience, whilst making few concessions to feverish critics constantly demanding to be intellectually challenged, often within the realms of faux intelligence.This isn't Shakespeare...it's Mortal KOMBAT!",Mortal Kombat

Stars of this movie by far I mean sub zero is twisted evil sinister and black hearted And Kano his one liners are on par with honestly the best I've seen in movies in the past 10 years hilarious (the table scene when there eating)Is this movie the best movie I've ever seen ? NO
is this movie Oscar quality? NO
but the reason I give this movie a rating of 10 is because it's a ""GAME MOVIE""

The Lead Kast pulled off some spectacular performances ... I loved the portrayal of few of the most iconic ""Kharacters"" in the Mortal Kombat Franchise (notably - Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Kung-Lao, Kano etc.) The costumes were epic ... very true to the video games (Kabal's costume was a standout). As a Sub-Zero fan, it was amazing seeing him as such a Badass in the movie!The action scenes were incredible & realistic. There was no dearth of Blood & Gore.One of the few concerns were Raiden & Shang Tsung! Our Elder God should have been given more prominence I suppose & the Sorcerer - Shang Tsung leading the forces of the Outworld to conquer Earth Realm should have looked more menacing & devious! Hopefully this gets sorted out in the upcoming movies.However, I enjoyed the movie overall .... Looking forward to the sequels & also our beloved Johnny Cage making a comeback from Hollywood!",Mortal Kombat

2157,tainozcorpchecks,Will not watch it a second time,3,27 April 2021,"The plot is a chronological order of the various events sent by an author (in the movies this is reflected in the script). It's the plot that makes this movie such a disaster. The film does not know how to unfold neither in the sub zero vs Scorpion rivality nor in the one carried out in the tournament.Every film must start from a script and this must tell the story sequentially and logically. When making a film of this type (video game of platforms fighting), emphasis must be placed on the actors, in this case the characters that intervene in the work and the reason for their existence. Higher than the recent one) the screenwriter took good care of the introduction of the characters and their performance in the film. For many sub zero is the most popular of MK, although it does not necessarily mean that it is the star. Not even Scorpions himself is. So the writers and the direction have to make the participation of the characters in the film minimally dignified and representative, whether these villains or not. Ex Reptile vs. Liu kan in MK part 1 (1995) that combat was epic, although Liu Kan was the winner, those who used to use Repitel in the arcades, I'm sure they were satisfied. Did you see the pathetic reptile in this new version? Makes you want to vomit. And that's just one example, I could give you more but I think the point is clear, right?

2158,dpintomartin,Great if you expectations are in line,8,27 April 2021,"This is a video game movie. You need to go into it knowing that. Is the main character a bit weak? Yes. Is it campy sometimes? Yes. Does it cater to MK fans with game references? Yes. Is the choreography awesome? Yes. Is it violent, sometimes needlessly? Yes. Does every actor give a great acting performance? No. Does is bring a decent story to get you invested beyond just a tournament? I think yes, although I will admit the story that is investing is the one established first, not the one revolving around Cole.If you go in being comfortable with this information, it is very enjoyable. The fights are spot on and as others have said, Kano kills it. This is absolutely an above average Video Game movie and those involved should be commended.",Mortal Kombat

2160,ntillman-55412,"Good movie, but could have been better",7,27 April 2021,"Tl;dr Good fights, mildly cheesy world buildingI'll start out by saying I've only been a fan of MK since MK9/MK 2011.That being said, this movie was quite good overall. Good fight choreography, gnarly finishing moves, and some solid comic relief for such an inherently gorey movie. It excelled at delivering the brutal MK fights that we know and love (albeit some were relatively short) with some minor world building.The only major con that I see is in said world building. They way they explained how the characters got their powers (e.g. Sub-Zero's ice powers) was kind of cheesy. However, it's not necessarily easy to create a unique way to explain how humans develop supernatural abilities, so it's not all that much of a con. Especially since you generally don't play MK for the story, you play it for the fighting. The movie should be viewed in a similar way, in my opinion.Overall, this was a good movie that I will most likely watch multiple times. I genuinely look forward to sequels.",Mortal Kombat
2161,drqueathem,Absolute waste of time,1,27 April 2021,This movie is garbage for replacing Jonny Cage with an unknown character. I will forever dislike this movie and recommend it to no one. I would rather watch the original movies than this ever again.,Mortal Kombat

It's an escape from the horror movie that is COVID-19. Let's just enjoy the beautiful CGI and valiant attempt at the escape from the real problem. I throughly enjoyed this film and growing up playing the original game helped foster that. With that said, it's a perfect film to take your mind off the everyday grind and doesn't disappoint.

I really think this new power concept would do extremely well to make Johnny Cage's background make more sense than in the games and it introduces potential rivalries. (not spoiling)Despite a few minor complaints I think this movie was extremely well done and a lot of the negative reviews are extremely inconsistent. I think the only complaints I really have is the main character falls a bit flat. However, they didn't make him this ultra powerful John Doe that people were afraid of, thus it allows other characters to take the spotlight. A few fights are a bit short but that's understandable when so much of the movie is combat. And although there's major deaths, there are characters like Kano, Kabal, and Kung Lao who are given a lot more significance than they ever have before.Please just decide for yourself whether you like it, go in with an open mind because it's a very fun movie to watch and it's intended to be a fun gory movie with some clever stuff sprinkled on top, not necessarily a carbon copy of the game's story again.",Mortal Kombat

I don't know if it's because he's a personal favorite but that's my opinion.

The Director did say he wanted to use other characters from the game that did not get much attention and I believe Cole was a good choice. How the movie starts off is amazing, it sticks to Scorpions Origins and the beginning of his rivalry with Sub-Zero. The CGI was amazing, the fighting choreography was phenomenal and the story as a whole was amazing. The director did say he was trying to stick to the games storyline and in all honesty he is doing good so far.

He brings a level of grace to the character that MK X and MK 11 equally captured.Asano Tadanobu was also a great choice for Raiden. There has always been a criticism of the God of Thunder being white washed. Asano has the cynicism that echoes the Christopher Lambert portrayal so well.Saddened over the recast of Shang Tsung but Cary-Hiroyuki can only be so young.

The original movies from the 90s were a big part of my childhood and I've literally waited years for a remake and when the 2021 remake surfaced I couldn't wait. That all said I feel this movie was a major anti climax for me. The timing was all wrong, the story was all wrong, the new character was a big flop and most of all the main character scorpion was literally on screen for 5 minutes!!This movie could have been great.. n I mean ""dark knight"" great.. but not all was lost. Shang Tsung was really original as was Kano. The rest of the cast didn't really do anything for me.Let's hope for the sequel they learn from this and produce something us life long fans deserve and can be proud of.",Mortal Kombat
2186,jf-001,24 years for this?!,1,13 June 2021,"I've been a Mortal Kombat fan since the very first game, so I've always held a great love and respect for the MK universe and lore, so when it was finally announced that we would be getting a new movie I was beyond excited.The first 10 minutes of the movie were okay. I liked that they gave us some kind of back-story to the origins of Scorpion and Sub Zero, but as soon as that was over the film continued on a downward spiral.The story focused mainly on Cole Young, whom, I believe, was a character that Warner Brothers mandated. This idea was banded about 10 years ago, but because of the negative feedback the film was scrapped, so it was baffling that 10 years on WB still insisted he remained. Him and his family brought nothing to the story, apart from bad acting.None of the characters felt authentic, I just didn't care about any of them, they didn't scream 'Mortal Kombat' to me in anyway, whether that was due to poor writing, directing, acting, or all three.It lacked any character development and there were scenes thrown in that had no explanation whatsoever, making absolutely no sense.Raiden was void of any personality and I could barely understand anything the actor was saying. His portrayal of Raiden didn't exude any wisdon or power like he should, in fact, he came across as a bit of an idiot and not very likeable. Nothing about Shang Tsung was menacing, unlike Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa's performance in the 1995 movie, which was pretty good as far as baddies go.Another huge let down was that Lui Kang looked about 16 years old, this made it difficult to connect with him as a character. Mileena came across pretty generic and lacklustre, and in my opinon, Sisi Stringer was a terrible choice. She can't act or fight, and had zero on-screen presence. She didn't even look like Mileena, for many reasons.The whole ""Arcana"" thing was a joke, not to mention that ridiculous birthmark retcon.How did all of this get green-lit? No wonder Ed Boon has kept quiet, if I were him I'd be insulted.The locations appeared very cheap and contrived. I get that there were budget constraints, but at least with the 1995 movie it felt big, it felt more cinematic, the sets were much more exciting. In the original, Outworld felt and looked like Outworld, whereas in this one it just looked like some sort of landfill or quarry.There were many moments where I couldn't help but laugh, not because they were intentionally funny, but because they were just so ridiculous. For example, Shang Tsung telling Nitara to go and Kill Kung Lao, only to be sliced in half within seconds. I could go on.This film felt rushed (even though it's been in development for god knows how long) and the fight scenes were poorly executed. The web series 'Legacy' was better, including the animated movie 'Scorpion's Revenge' - go watch it if you haven't!I've read many people compare this to 'Power Rangers' and I have to agree with them, only this was worse. No amount of gore or bad language could save this travesty, which was obviously what their USP was.After 24 years I wanted to enjoy this, I really did, but for me, it lacked everything that makes Mortal Kombat what it is. It's a good job I kept notes whilst watching this, otherwise I'd have forgotten everything about it.If they know what's good for this franchise I suggest they wait a few years and come back with better writers, directors and actors.I'm off to watch the 1995 movie to help wash away the bitter taste that this embarrassment has left.",Mortal Kombat

To be fair, it is most likely impossible to provide exposition for the Mortal Kombat universe and characters. There is more than one version of the Mortal Kombat story and they do have minor differences between them, but this movie took some... creative liberties. I love Mortal Kombat and its character's backstories, but they were very different here. I was extremely confused with everything from the beginning and come to realize that this was more focused on ""Sub-zero vs. Scorpion"" rather than the actual tournament. Also, aside from the story, there are some cringe dialogues referencing the games that seem out of place.All in all, I would still rather watch the 1995 adaptation, and if you want an actual story, play the past three Mortal Kombat games.

The little Easter eggs like when a character says ""flawless victory"" was delivered in a corny way, None of the story seems to fit the way I expected it to. Honestly the best fighting scene was the trailer they released early. Everything else just felt ""Meh."" Nothing stood out to me! Nothing blew me away. Why is Lui Kang such a little wus?! Goro looks like a pus. Who tf is Cole and why couldn't the director make him slightly interesting??! The way scorpion just pops outta no where is dumb. They just blew it with this one in my opinion.

2199,suzanajovic-32032,This franchize was so milkedbthat all good is sucked out,5,3 May 2021,"Well, this is first movie ever that I didn't like. I was so hyped ,but when I watched it ....meeh. I stoped watching somewhere on 30 mins. I knew that I won't be sorry that I didn't watch the rest. Averall it was a bit boring ,and story was to much fasten up. There was no dramatical buildup .You got served everything straight of the bat. I can say that special effects were pretty good , but one major flaw was sound . It was to quet and they could have risen up volume a bit. Well I knew it would be bad ,because Mortal Kombat is preety milked and all good milk was drinked. Also good Mortal Kombat movie is quite hard movie to make. Because every movie starts whith champions that have to go on certain tournament. Then they slovly start to meet each other ,then vilians show up. That is to clishe and I understand the movie crew. Because if you were to make movie about mk10 or 11 it wouldn't make sense,and everybody would be confused ,because they don't know original story. So I think it would been beter if this was a series.",Mortal Kombat
2200,kingkb-96876,If you like Mortal Kombat and you're here to be entertained this movie does it,7,3 May 2021,Personally I give it a 7 because of the fact that if there are more movies after this it lays a somewhat good groundwork this is no groundbreaking movie but a good movie that is entertaining like everything is pretty average the special effects were great I like the actors and acting I side with a lot of people when they say that coal the new character they created for this movie it's kind is kind of basic hopefully they get a second movie so we can get the tournament cuz I'm not going to lie this movie does feel like a part one or something small of a bigger thing.,Mortal Kombat

I loved how they didn't skimp on the violence and gore and how they perfectly mixed it with comedic moments also how they used iconic lines and moves from the games. The writing especially the screenplay was superb. The visual effects were remarkable especially Sub-Zero's powers, Liu's powers, Scorpion's Kunai, Milenna's powers, Jax's arms, Syzoth (Reptile), Raiden's powers, Cole's powers, Nitara's wings, Kung's hat, Goro, Sonya's powers, and Kano's powers. The acting was stupendous especially from Jessica McNamee, Josh Lawson, Sisi Stringer, Mehcad Brooks, Lewis Tan, Max Huang, Ludi Lin, Hiroyuki Sanada, Joe Taslim, Tadanobu Asano, and Damon Herriman. The makeup and hairstyling was phenomenal especially on Sisi Stringer, Josh Lawson, Ludi Lin, Chin Han, Mel Jarnson, Max Huang, Jessica McNamee, and Lewis Tan. The costumes were outstanding especially ones wore by Hiroyuki Sanada, Tadanobu Asano, Max Huang, Sisi Stringer, Joe Taslim, Chin Han, Ludi Lin, Lewis Tan, Daniel Nelson, Mel Jarnson, and Josh Lawson. The sets were spectacular. The score was also great. To me this was an A+ movie.",Mortal Kombat

2206,atkinsonsean,Don't believe the low reviews!!,10,3 May 2021,Nearly didn't watch this because of the low reviews but glad I did. Awesome action and fight scenes set up perfect for another movie. It's an 7.5 out of ten but I gave 10 stars on here because I feel it's unjustly low rated.,Mortal Kombat
2207,stunnadelao,True to the game,8,3 May 2021,I found the film quite entertaining with a very different storyline. The movie felt short although it is about 2hrs long. Lots of action with cool fight scenes and blood. The addition of cole can be a hit and a miss or first base depending on how the storyline for the film is developed. As a fan of the game and movies other than the cgi Gorro i caught myself enjoying the movie unravel. Id say if your an mk fan you will enjoy the fight scenes along with the fighters move set combinations. I give it a thumbs up!!,Mortal Kombat
2208,hazardjon,At a loss for word,1,4 May 2021,"Terrible. The first 8 minutes was released early and it gave me high hopes. Unfortunately, the first 8 minutes were the best 8 minutes. The tone, feel and pacing complete 180 after the opening scene. Why make sub zero and scorpion the focus of the beginning only to give scorpion 3 minutes of screen time? Stupid story, horrible acting, dialog was stupid and childish. Yes, there is some nostalgia, but beyond the violence, this movie related most with the 10-12 year old demographic. Action scenes were good, well choreographed, cinematography was very good, but as a whole, it was just bad. So bad I am kind of annoyed. I wasted my time and they completely blew an opportunity in my opinion. I dont understand how anyone could have possibly enjoyed anything other than the beginning, and any rating over a 4 or 5 is just delusion, or written by someone associated with the movie.

The plot was good and the movie stayed true to the original game.That being said, it was obvious that they opted to budget for better graphics rather than high paying actors. This, I appreciate. This allowed them to create better quality CGI for important concepts that are needed for this movie.I don't know about you, but I would hate a movie that had decent actors and crappy CGI, especially with Mortal Kombat.I look forward to another movie and hopefully the budget will be better.",Mortal Kombat

2225,noahrg-46843,Hits and Misses,6,7 May 2021,"This is my first movie review ever so bare with me. No this movie isn't amazing or so bad that it compelled me to write my first movie review.This movie had me so excited from the trailer and ready to finally have a strong storyline/action sequences in a Mortal Kombat adaptation. The trailer was better than the movie in my opinion.Story - Mortal Kombat 2021 left me wanting more. The first 10-15 minutes of this movie is the best part and as emotional/deep as it gets. If this movie kept the same serious and emotional tone as the first 15 minutes, I'm sure this would be on my top 10 movies list of the year. The story is one of the most simple and insulting ones to an adults brain that I've seen. Right after the opening sequence which was so amazing, the screen blacks out and literally writes out the story in words. It seemed very lazy. This movie's story is basically bad guys want to kill the good guys. It's literally that simple and boring. Boring doesn't mean the actual movie was boring though. It can get quite entertaining and funny at times.Characters - I feel this movie did justice for only a few characters. Sub-Zero was awesome. They displayed his power and threatening presence very well. I felt like things were about to go down anytime he was on screen.Kano was hilarious and felt like Kano ! He drinks, he's a jerk, he's a fighter. I loved him.Scorpion was very dark and revenge fueled. I wish he was in the movie more but when he was, it was like perfect !Now, Kung Lao and Liu Kang ... come on. They deserved so much more screen time and action. They felt weak and awkward. I wanted so much more from considering how important they are to Mortal Kombat.Sonya and Jax ... cool. That's all. They were cool.The other characters in the movie... I'm not gonna really get into. They were just there... including Cole.Action - surprisingly.... I wanted more ! Some of the fights ended way to quick and abrupt. I wanted more and less cuts ! But some of fights were also damn satisfying. We wanted blood and gore and that's what we got. That's where the movie does the game justice. Sub-Zero vs Scorpion is magic.Overall... I'd watch this movie again but not by myself. I would need someone to laugh and complain too during the film to make me feel better about things ya know ? Good attempt at a Mortal Kombat movie and respect for everything they tried to do. Simply missed the mark for a bit more than I expected.",Mortal Kombat
2226,lukekelly-68904,Great adaptation,10,7 May 2021,"Great film, with amazing fight scenes. Sub zero is one of the best villains to enter our screens. If you're a die hard fan you will love this film. Haters will hate but cannot deny this is a great film.",Mortal Kombat

It's amazing, to avoid spoilers I just have to say that I got goosebumps from a certain part of the story that I shall not touch on. That, mixed with Kano's humour and The special effects make this my favourite movie of all time. As a fan of the series I might be a little bit biased but the before mentioned goosebumps and generally laughing out loud proves that any Mortal Kombat fan will almost certainly adore this movie and even some who's never heard of it will probably love it too.

There's zero character development or arcs (except perhaps for one double-cross that's projected a mile away). None of the characters are interesting and we have absolutely no reason whatsoever to care what happens to any of them.

For me, this movie was a joy in some cases but a slap in the face in others.Yes, some characters absolutely shined. Yes, the action was really great to see. Yes, it was interesting to see the choice of characters they used for the movie...
But making up a character who has NEVER been in a MK title before the film was a a HUGE mistake. There are SO MANY OTHER characters already IN the franchise they could've picked and written better!Now, I DO respect the effort all involved had and I do respect the fact that they tried to make a great movie, and they DID succeed in most cases. Watching Sub-Zero and Scorpion square off in different generations was a nice gesture to the fact that they have a nasty history with each other. The opening scene was incredible and the ending fight scene with them was great. If they had JUST taken OUT Cole it would've been even more enjoyable to watch. Sub-Zero's presence on screen was so hypnotic and eye-catching and I quite enjoyed him as a villain. Kano was hilarious and I wish the writers had put in the same kind of effort into Cole, since they tried to shove the classic ""character is a descendant of a great warrior and will be as well"" down our throats.I wish movie makers would just USE the SOURCE material with respect! I know most are all about how much money they will get to make but if the people who made the Sonic the Hedgehog movie LISTENED to the fanbase and adjusted what was asked and received high marks why can't OTHER movie makers do something similar? We DON'T NEED new characters JUST to make a movie. Just... please... actually make USE of established characters! Poor Mileena and Nitara were underused and classic favorites like Kitana were nowhere to be seen. It WAS great to see Kabal though, not gonna lie.So I would suggest if you watch this movie just watch it with no expectations and you might like it.",Mortal Kombat

Who gave you the right to make this movie like this?! Awful man... awful! First one was made over 20 years ago, with much more limited technology, and it's 10 times better... even now in 2021. Disappointing :(",Mortal Kombat
2264,franemandic,Great movie only for Mortal Kombat fans,8,2 June 2021,"This movie is a Mortal kombat movie you would expect it to be. Great music, tons of blood, constant battles and a suprisingly good story. Even thought its story does not have a lot in common with the videogames its really enjoyable. This movie is pretty good for people who enjoyed the games and previous movies, but for anybody who didnt enjoy neither of those two things, dont even try watching.",Mortal Kombat
2265,jackbeals,Lame additions,5,3 June 2021,"First things first, the positives, the cast all did an amazing job with what little they were given. Not a single performance was bad. Some stand outs were Josh Lawson as the hilarious Kano and Joe Taslim as the incredibly threatening and overall cool Sub-Zero. Other than the cast the movie has a lot of problems, especially for fans of the game lore. First off, Cole Young is one of the lamest additions to the lore. He has very little character and is a waste of Lewis Tan. His abilities are boring and he steals the spotlight from Liu Kang who should've been the main character, as well as butting in on the grudge match between Scorpion and Sub-Zero. Furthermore, Cole was introduced to have an audience surrogate without using Johnny Cage because they didn't want a white protagonist...even though that role is traditionally aimed at Liu Kang, the CHINESE MONK. Not only that, Johnny Cage doesn't HAVE to be white, it's not that important to his character. Cole also kills Goro, who is the CHAMPION OF MORTAL KOMBAT. Liu Kang should be the only one allowed to defeat Goro but they treat him and the other villains as just goons. Kabal is the only villain with any personality. Liu Kang is disrespected as the main character of the franchise barely has any part in the movie. Raiden has more in common with Gordon Ramsey than source material changes and is useless leading to massive plot holes. This movie was all setup for the tournament when it should've just been the tournament to give a good reason for Raiden not to curbstomp team Outworld. Lastly, and most certainly the worst part of the movie, the Arcana mechanic is the dumbest change from the source material. Nobody ever cared why many of the characters had powers, in fact most of them already have explanations but the Arcana concept leads to more problems than it solves. Having Jax grow his arms is really dumb when in the games they just build him the arms after he loses them. Source material explanations for powers include: Liu Kang's fire powers and Kung Lao's blade hat coming from just being a practitioners of magic. Sonya Blade's purple ring thing comes from technology. Sub-Zero's ice is because he's descended from Outworld sorcerers. Kano's laser eye is because he has a cyborg eye, which is the most iconic part of his design which they didn't give him. Not all of this movie was bad however. The plot is insulting to Mortal Kombat fans but the mindless action and spectacle is fantastic. Sub-Zero and Scorpion's fight before Cole Young butts in as he tends to do, is some of the best choreography I've seen in a while. Joe Taslim really gave a great performance with just his eyes, being extremely intimidating and giving Bi-Han a interesting snarl-esque breathing effect. Josh Lawson is hilarious and steals the show many times, especially with his interaction with Kabal. Hiroyuki Sanada also gave a great performance and I would've liked to see more of him. In the end, this movie is an entertaining mess and will infuriate hardcore fans of the series. However, this can be turned around in the sequel, shift focus to Liu Kang or Johnny Cage or anyone but Cole Young. Sweep arcana under the rug and give the villains more character. Lastly, give Hiroyuki Sanada and Joe Taslim more scene together, they are great acting off eachother.",Mortal Kombat

With all the games/material that's out now, mainly Mortal Kombat 9, this should have been a cakewalk in regards to story and character development. The worst part of the movie is the main character Cole Young. No reason to add a character to the already big roster Mortal Kombat has, let alone make him the main character. And I'm not against having new characters show up but he should not be the main character it's been Liu Kang and the other Earth Realm Fighters for the most part since the beginning. The way they get their powers the Arcana is also terrible it's a real lame and lazy way to explain how the fighters do the Feats that they do in the Mortal Kombat universe. If you're a Mortal Kombat fan you know that blood and gore isn't what makes Mortal Kombat Mortal Kombat there's much more there (story). All it would have took them is to play any of the recent games to see. It's a real shame though I'll give it this the effects and fighting we were kind of cool.",Mortal Kombat

2275,liamoverington-16242,A bit disappointed,3,1 July 2021,"Having grown up in the era of when Ed Boon & John Tobias (Midway) created the Video Games from day 1, I had followed the series for many years so I had high hopes for this reinvigorated movie.The first Mortal Kombat movie from back in the late 90's was a great storyline with great characters that flowed nicely. I was excited when MK: Annihilation was announced but soon became disheartened when the entire cast (except Liu Kang) was replaced and key characters just written off in the first 10 minutes of the film (Johnny Cage).Whilst I understand you can't really bring back the original actors and that isn't the point here, I do think the majority of actors (with exception to Sub-Zero) were a poor choice for the type of movie this should have been. I cannot put my finger on it but I felt that they just didn't fit their roles, voices, demeanour, use of special abilities etc.The movie jumps from scene to scene with very little substance to it - I kept waiting for a tournament to happen but it never really did, it felt more like just some random fight scenes.The special effects was good and the film captured quite a bit of the gore upon which the MK series is based but it still didn't really go far enough in my opinion. A large proportion of MK video games had multiple fatality options including many occasions whereby the surrounding environment was used, there wasn't much more than just a few knives and Kung Lao's hat I thought.I finished watching the film and kind of felt like I still didn't really understand the point of Cole, I didn't see the point in Nitara and I really couldn't get on with Raiden - Christopher Lambert was the best Raiden out of all of them IMO.So it's going to be a trilogy, I would say I can't wait for the next film but sadly I am not all that excited.Good effort but a big let down in my opinion.",Mortal Kombat
2276,stephenpricejohn,It is what it is.,8,10 July 2021,"Giving the Mortal Kombat reboot a 10/10 would be obsurd, as I rarely give any movie a 10, however in this film I like how they have went back to the roots and give the fans the back story of Sub Zero and Scorpion.The plot to introduce a decendant of Scorpion can be taken as a hot or miss, personally I wasn't convinced of the character. It was however good to see some cool CGI game moments with the battles ""Flawless Victory""That being said, I did enjoy watching the movie and would reccomend fans to give it a watch, becauase lets honest the so called ""originals"" were extremely hard watch.I look forward to seeing the sequel (providing it gets signed on) and seeing were they are going to take the story.",Mortal Kombat

The characters were not properly introduced, and if you are not familiar with the game you would not know who is who. The story is glorifying scorpion and sub zero, which every mortal kombat spin off series/animated series since the original movies have done so(nothing new here). I just wish they would realize there are other characters in the game/series that have more interesting back stories that are quite interesting and not ""used up"" so to speak. The best fight scene in the whole movie is relatively early on when Sub Zero rips the arms off of Jax, and then Jax disappears for the rest of the movie. The main character is who? Hanzo(Scorpion) is his ancestor? Well I'm sorry, he was horrible and the actor who portrayed him wasn't much better. He just didn't seem to have ""star status"".",Mortal Kombat

To begin, many main characters were poorly expressed, and they didn't feel like they were anywhere close to what they are in the games and lore of the games. Also, I think that it was very disappointing to only see the fan-favorite character, Scorpion, get a limited amount of screen time. I just feel that this movie stretched the source material a little to thin introducing a completely new character NEVER EVEN MENTIONED IN THE FRANCHISE!!!! Despite all of those issues with the movie, including spacing, the movie also did some things AMAZING. Having characters like Bi-Han, the first Sub-Zero, Goro, Mileena, Reptile, and Kabal, was great, however Mileena in some moments, Kabal, Reptile and Kano I feel were kind of given just a bad character re-design instead of just following the nature of the characters in the game.

2287,ethanstarkey-61147,"A Flawed, but Very Exciting Action/Adventure",7,10 September 2021,"Many ordinary movie watchers may not catch on with Mortal Kombat's rich mythology and wide array of characters if they aren't familiar with the video game franchise itself, but Mortal Kombat itself strides to be different in it's execution and world-building while keeping true to the roots of the game with it's over-the-top violence and bloody gory fighting styles of characters like Sub-Zero and Kano. The movie features unique characters from different races and from different backgrounds that blend and work together pretty coherently and effectively, and while Mortal Kombat might not have the greatest visual effects work out there it does make up for it strong costume design, well-built production values, and interesting locations as well. The movie does tend to have choppy dialogue from time to time but there are fun moments between the characters as well, with even some emotional and moving moments as well, and introduces a new spin on a different character development in the form of Cole Young, a mixed martial arts fighter and down on his luck father trying to find his place in the world when he's brought into the world of Mortal Kombat and his path is laid before him but he's torn on choosing between his family or his destiny, and to be concluded on this point his character in the movie is sometimes lost at periods between scenes but overall he is an interesting character who could be built up more in a sequel to the movie. To be concluded and to follow on my last point, I think this movie after watching it deserves a sequel because it leaves a lot of unanswered questions and if you are a fan of the franchise such as myself or a simple movie watcher looking for a fun action/ adventure fantasy film that creates a new world of mythology on screen while respecting the lore of the video games itself, and not to mention It has a bit of a cliffhanger at the end that just might be you wondering what is going to happen next and leaving you wanting for more #releasethesequel .",Mortal Kombat
2288,simmyreddy,"As a fan, don't bother",2,10 September 2021,"As a Mortal Kombat fan, I hate this movie. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the CGI was good and it was the goriness we love from Mortal Kombat.Aside from that, they have once again changed everything about Mortal Kombat, introducing a new character Cole who nobody knows/cares about.Scorpion was barely in the movie who is a fan favourite that everybody loves or loves to hate. Not once in the games did Scorpion and Sub zero ever speak in their native tongue, yet they did in the movie, not a big detail, but still an apparent one to show us that things are changing.The way the kombatants are chosen is ridiculous too, a random mark appears and now you must fight. Why, no clue. In the games, Raiden hand picks the kombatants and explains everything.Now we dive into characters, Raiden, the beloved thunder god who is kind, but stern had a major overhaul for the worse. They made him extremely mean and seemingly uncaring, an exact opposite of how he should be. They also made his presence a lot less intimidating by making him shorter than usual and his voice isn't deep at all in the movie. Basically they chose the wrong person to play him.They changed the way Jax lost and gets his metallic arms. Not the biggest deal ever, but this leads me to my next point... the abilities.In Mortal Kombat games, each character has their own move set and origin, however in the movie they get their ""powers"" from the mark. A ridiculous plot point. Sonya's rings have always been know to come from her special forces gauntlets, but in the movie they're just ring markings on her arms. The same is true for the way many other characters develop, to name a few, Kano's laser eye, Jax's arms, Liu Kang's fire balls etc.There are many other character flaws as well, to name one that urks me, the way Mileena looks. I shudder at the thought. The costumes for sub zero and Scorpion are OK, but you can clearly see that their masks are over-sized.They also tried to over-do the Ozzy part of Kano by making him swear at pretty much every opportunity, and they made him really dumb which he is not.Characters would say really cringey things in cringe ways, such as ""Fatality"", ""insert name wins"", ""Flawless Victory"" etc.I could go on forever, but I will stop myself.In conclusion, if you're new to Mortal Kombat, go for it, however if you're a long time fan such as myself, save yourself the waste of time.This in my opinion is just a classic Hollywood stunt where they take something and change it completely, slap the name of something really successful on it and just use the name to make money, while not caring about the fan base and giving the fans what they want. At the end of the day I see this being all about money.This is unfortunately the sad truth.",Mortal Kombat

Was excited when the original film was released and have been waiting very patiently for this to finally come out!...Literally split in 2 over the film (Fatality!)Its fun, looks fantastic (considering budget) majority of the characters are done well, Kano (best Kano yet -hats off to Josh Lawson!)/Kung/Scorpion/Sub really stand out for me, some fantastic fan service and it does resemble and follow the lore... to a degreeBut.. unfortunately, everything is just too diluted.. odd decisions, no explanations etc make it messy and incoherent. Not an easy feat including as many characters as it did and that's one of downfalls -just not enough development.. maybe couple less characters and a longer run time focussing on backstory and filling in some gaps would have helped character relationships and connection with the viewer!The fight scenes and choreography were great, the gore was done right but must say, the shooting style & feel of the bi-han/hasashi and scorp/sub fights were far superior to the restAll this being said, it's an MK movie.. it's always gonna be silly and far fetched.. I think it took itself a little too seriously, you either go fully grounded and super serious or keep it tongue in cheek.. it tries to sit in the middle and just doesn't quite work.Overall, I enjoyed it but just longed for more and couldn't help but wince at some of the missed opportunities. It's a good adaption and decent starting point. I really hope it does well enough to kick off an MK universe. More like a 6 / 10 but gave it an MK bonus star 😂",Mortal Kombat

There were certain scenes that were brilliantly produced for example The scene at the beginning of the film was a visual masterpiece. I was disappointed with Raiden and Liu Kang's portrayals, However Kano's character was a stand out for me as were Kung Lao and Sonia Blade. Nitara's fatality was the only real Epic fatality and Goro's scene was a let down. I liked the references they made to other fighters and the hidden messages seen in the background that convey to the viewer there will be a sequel for example Kitana's fan is seen in the background of one of the scenes.

It sets up a sequel, and I do hope it gets it for another chance, but if you're looking for an adaptation closer to the games, I'd recommend sticking with the 1995 version or the animated Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge film.",Mortal Kombat

Kano. The actor got 100000% the personality. I honestly couldn't think of a better portrait of the character. ON POINT! KUDOS Josh Lawson.Kung Lao and Jax were another great characters.

2316,darktrew_m,Disappointing,4,25 April 2021,"Scorpion and Subzero do all the heavy lifting with their awesome fighting and story arc, the rest of the characters feel like side quest NPCs - weak fights, subpar dialogue, no development and most of the casting choices are mediocre at best. Like most of the 'modern' movies it feels like it was filmed in a cupboard, there is no amplitude to the settings shown - some desert scenes and that's it. These people have no idea how to create and show epic scenes. The dialogue tries to be witty and there are a few glimpses of humor, but it is mostly bland.With all its wanting parts, it could've still been a nice action flick. But then we get to the most terrible part - the music is absolutely abysmal. There's again a total lack of epicness, it feels disconnected from the action and it totally ruins some of the better fight scenes. The soundtrack in the original was an important part of its cult status. What we get in this one is totally the opposite, a completely forgettable soundtrack. Even the remix of the original song is bad. Some of the voices have these effects that make them sound like cheap videogame voiceovers.I was hoping this would be a good movie, but it is not.",Mortal Kombat

Should've explain more MK lore.characters are okay but some of the iconic ones deserves more. Raiden is quite different here compared to the game and the 1995 movie. He needs better script.the overall vibe is too hollywood-esque. I want them to be more brave and make it looks like an actual video game adaptation.the jump cuts of the fight scenes is too much. This is mortal kombat dammit i want to see people throwing hands clearly.fight scenes not long enough.they brought too many characters but with limited runtime, we couldn't get proper interactions between them or even their backstories.they altered a bit of the MK lore, certainly not consulting either Boon or Tobias. But it's just MKCU so maybe die hard fans would still allow it.probably just me but i wanted more cheesy corny lines. It's not supposed to be a serious movie anywayscore is disappointing. Needs more techno, percussions and creepy ambient music. I loved 1995 movie score more and i don't even know the composer's name.I think that is all.

Kano was really entertaining loved his Australian accent that gave it a funny tone.I didn't like the white eyes of raiden and the cgi used on the temple!

Some of really important elements just didn't have enough context to be properly understood. While a few annoying parts were even repeated. There was also quite a lot of inconsistency.

+ game references

Now to go into depth.SPOILER WARNING:I am not going to hold back since I have been a die hard Mortal Kombat fan since I played Mortal Kombat in arcade as a kid. I have played every single game since. The movie does Subzero justice with Bi-Han because he is a ruthless killer and it shows. The production team thought they were justified in creating another character with Cole played by a still piece of wood that is another cliche ""Chosen one"" who honestly made me pray that he would get murdered every time I saw him fight but unfortunately never happened. They also included some of the most ridiculous characters in Mortal Kombat such as Reiko and Nitara who are honestly so annoying that when they were on the receiving ends of a fatality, I laughed. Now we go onto the awful acting of Shang Tsung which I honestly felt like the actor playing him was so boring that I thought he was reading off a teleprompter. But let me get onto the dumbest aspect and it's the story. They play off Cole as this chosen one who was a descendant of scorpion and even the two main heroes in the Mortal Kombat games Liu Kang and Raiden, takes a backseat to this Hollywood garbage can known only as Cole. This whole story of ""Arcana"" nonsense is just so stupid and it completely ruins the integrity of the Mortal Kombat games.

I expected since we are in 2021 to recieve a real epic adventure with detalied story telling and more brainwork for the viewer. Mortal Kombat could be a easily a epic saga filling every theathers around the globe... now i'm 80% sure this will be the only one movie about it for the next 10-15 years.

Is that really the best they could muster up? Where do they find these actors? It's like they aren't even trying. The film is cut together like an absolute mess and everything seems rushed and placed in together so tightly it's so far from anything natural that it's a chore for the most part.The storytelling, well...
In all honesty, if the bad guys were serious about their intent they'd end things pretty quick. Sub zero wouldn't walk down the street raining ice cubes on everyone. But without it there would be no story, well that's just poor writing. Lazy imo.The fighting is typical and the special effects aren't bad, but at times it just felt like snippets on MK11 in live action. Which isn't a bad thing, but the way it was done was short and sharp and mashed in without any rhyme or reason.The editing was also rushed and sloppy.

Cole Young is a boring and forgettable character and my initial feeling proved me right that he was a very bad idea to focus the movie around. Kano was by far the best thing about this movie. Even though I was no fan at all of this Arcana nonsense and how they got their powers. Completely unnecessary.Mortal Kombat has almost 30 years of lore, there was no need for this.Goro, Mileena and Kung Lao were totally wasted. Shang Tsung taking Kungs soul out of nowhere felt really off and had no pay off - at least for me.Reiko could've been literally any other character - completely interchangeable.Raiden was just kinda there.I'm really mad what they did to Reptile. He didn't look good and had no need to be there. Same for Goro, they said he was so expensive and then they waste him for Cole???I guess you could say the final fight had some memorable moments between Scorpion and Sub-Zero, but then Cole dragged it down for me.Guess I'm too spoiled with the Raid and IP Man movies too expect an epic fight in an American movie.The few fatalities were fun.This is just a set up for the next movie because we never make it to the tournament. Guess Shang Tsung can bring everyone back, but Cole remains a big problem.I just hope the producers take the criticism to heart and really deliver with the next one, but it's WB and they don't really get the fans.

Unfortunately, the battles were often very short and characters killed quickly, some of which should never have been in a pre-tournament movie.

So standard. Missed to opportunity to really hype on the fight scenes with some badass techno/fighting music.In the overall, for any regular person it's an OK movie. For a fan was awesome!

They don't use the Mortal Kombat music really until the end. I would of like to hear it before hand not to mention its a remix of the original which sucked.

The script borders on being nonsensical with one convenient plot contrivance after another used to try and explain away the complete lack of forethought but into the story.This was clearly an attempt to do MK as an Avengers movie and it fails miserably. Not a single character has even a shred of backstory or motivation. It has a very diverse cast, but the acting is terrible. Everyone involved is delivery clichéd, flat out cheesy line after line. The dramatic moments don't feel earned and the humor lands with a thud.The fights are good, if not almost all rushed. The effects that support them are not.

It's more like a parody of Mortal Kombat, Highlander, Black Panther, MMA, Superman's laser eyes(?)... LOL... This movie just ridiculously takes the Mortal Kombat franchise and makes it look like another chapter of the Scary Movie series!!! Damn, it was hard to watch this mega eyesore. 1995 version though wasn't a great movie, but was way better than this insanely terrible movie. Example of it's stupidity: Raiden can't interfere in the battles between Outworld & Earths warriors, but is a protector of the realm of Earth, and though the tournament hasn't even begun which they keep implying, the Outworld forces are already trying to kill Earth warriors before the tournament and yet Raiden can't do nothing to the Outworld forces who hasn't had 10 tournament wins to have jurisdiction over Earth, and yet Raiden can't do anything even when non chosen warriors are also being killed by Outworld warriors. So what exactly is Raiden protecting???? See the stupidity in the whole Plot???? And what's is with Jax getting a bionic arm from Monks then getting an upgraded arm through some sort of force that also happens to give Cole, a Wakandan Black Panther like suit!!! LOL...WHAT THE???? Sonya Blade gets her powers Highlander style by killing Kano who happens to manifest a laser eye and not from a cybernetic implant like in the games!!! LOL...

I usually love him in film.There was no explanation really of why or development of outfield. The temple was a joke. Shang Tsung was limp and really nothing to fear. He took one soul eh.Lord Raiden was a joke. They spent way too much time on Cole and his family. To build up you liking him.

2424,betim-alimi,Worst Mortal Kombat Movie!! This should allowed to be called Mortal Kombat.,1,18 April 2021,"This Movie will hurt the Brand Mortal Kombat.The beginning was fire, the opening is almost the same like in MK Legacy Episode Sub zero and Scorpion. The fight scene in the opening were really perfect.After that, this movie becomes soooo boring the main character is a non existing character of the MK universe, thsi Character Cole Young is soooo unnecesarry for this whole Movie he dont belong in the universe also he is not doing any favour for this movie he is just existing.Kung Lao and Liu Kang doesnt have enough screentime they are potraid here sooo boring, Rayden also dont enjoy enough screentime.Than what i missed all the time is the Morta Kombat Vibe this Mysterious, oriental style also not the music is in that way.The worst of all of them is the Fight scenes beside from the opening, the Fight scenes are just rushed, too short and not very well choregraphed.Some people laugh about MK Annihilation but i was more entertaint by MK annihilation than this movie. Annihilation had better fight scenes and it was about shao kahn want to rule the world. In this Movie it was almost never about the MK Character but it was about Cole Young.In my eyes im really Glad that MK 95 and Annihilation and MK Conquest exists, because this movie is not good.Also reptile was potrayed soooo cheap and he was maybe 1 minute in the movie.Scorpion was perfect but also his screentime is only 15 minutes long.Every Mortal Kombat movie told and twisted the story sometimes never to be true to the game, this movie doesnt do that at all which it doesnt bother me, but what this movie did was Unforgivable making a movie who doesnt has anything to do with the brand itself they really tried to do a different movie and call it MK.In my eyes the producer Tod Garner should better let Larry Kasanoff produce the MK Movies because he knew what was good for those. In my eyes todd garner doesnt know the brand at all and he should be ashamed for this Movie.They are fatalitys but they dont help to be the movie good. Better
renounce the fatalitys but make the movie entertaining.Im the biggest MK Fan ever when its comes to all the Media they released i didnt played all the Game but i played, MK 1 - 3, i played MK Sub Zero Mythology, MK Shaolin Monks, MK Deception, MK Armagedon, MK 9, MK 11.I still prefer MK Shaolin Monks overall than MK 9, than Sub Zero Mythology.I hope they will do a MK Shaolin Monks movie they can use the same actors again who play kung lao and liu kang.But please dont continue with this horrible storyline from this movie.When u have MK 95 which is gold in my eyes, annihilation which was not good received, but i think is better than this. Than MK Conquest which is also gold and had the best Rayden and Shao Kahn who was potrayed by the same actor in the same series. U dont need this New Mortal Kombat.The only good thing in the new MK Movie are special effects, but hey technology changed since almost 25 years.",Mortal Kombat
2425,damienbeckham,"It's good, but it's best scenes were in the trailers...",6,22 April 2021,"Mortal Kombat 2021 was promised to be more gore, more fatalities, more intense.What we got was a poorly written plot, bad acting on several cast members, and really, really good visuals.I did not enjoy how there was no tournament, it didn't stick to the usual story. Now normally that wouldn't be a problem except this time around, they robbed us of screen time of our favorite characters. The main character Cole was an unnecessary addition to the cast and plot. Every bad scene in the movie had to do with him, they also disrespected a few characters with how easy they were killed, and the fight scenes were much too short. The fatalities were all shown on the trailers, almost every death was seen in the trailer.The casting for Raiden wasn't enjoyable, he also got very little screen time, though good because he was hard to look at, you just didn't seem to care about him or any of the characters all that much. The only character they tried to make you like and give any character development was Cole, the one person could care less about as a whole. They throw action at you and it's enjoyable, but it's short lived and a lot of important scenes are so rushed, it feels like they cut 30 minutes from the movie on accident.With that being said, the Mortal Kombat feel is there, the music is poor until the last Act, but the spot on casting for some of the cast made you feel right at home. It was an enjoyable movie, but not better than the original.

Even tho I don't know the whole Mortal Kombat lore, I believe it was obvious that the director and the cast respected the source material and wanted to make a good film, which they did in my opinion. Great cinematography overall with beautiful landscapes, a very nice music score including the iconic soundtrack, the casting was spot on and the fighting was non stop from start to finish, exactly what you would expect to see in a Mortal Kombat movie. I will not spoil anything here because I believe, every Mortal Kombat fan or anyone who just likes fighting movies should watch it and make up their own mind. My score for the movie is easily 9/10 with only ""complaint"" really being that, I enjoyed it so much I could see myself watching an extra hour more, didn't want it to end.

I grew up with Sega and MK2 and MK3. Was fully blown away by the movie. You can tell the creative team really cares for MK and it's lore.Trully a love letter to all MK fans. And in my book, it is BY FAR, the best VG movie of all time! 10/10 ❤🖤",Mortal Kombat
2439,zaidgourbandi-158-993261,My personal thoughts of the film!!!!,6,25 April 2021,"Hi all, (this might be a little bit long sorry)I am a huge fan of the whole Mortal Kombat franchise and I have just watched the new film last night.Here are my thoughts personally:
I thought it was a decent movie and probably the best video game movie out (better than the 1995 one, at least there is no snake coming out of Scorpion's hand lol) they got that right.I had absolute high expectations for the film I feel this movie could have done much better like wtf is Cole even in this film. Honestly the first 13 mins was the most greatest moment of the film.I will point out the Good and Bads of the film.The Goods:Loved the rivalry origin story between Sub Zero and ScorpionI also loved the fatalities and outfits. Every character had great outfits and matched the game (Especially Kabals outfit)Kano was great in this film and mad funny.The Sub zero and Scorpion was by far the best fight in the movie in my opinion and probably the longest out off all fights.Sub Zero was badass as well as ScorpionThe Bads:let me start off and say Cole Young. He wasn't necessary really not needed. In the games Hanzo doesn't have a daughter and he is the last Shirai Ryu memberthe fights were really quick and a lot of cuts in between. The Liu Kang and Kabal fight could have been done much better TBH.Liu Kang looked like a pretty boy in this film. They showed him to be so weak, he couldn't even defeat Sub Zero. Absolutely disappointed, in the games his earthrealms champion and chosen one.Kitana should have fought Mileena instead of Sonya, I did see kitanas weapon though.Reptile died way too early, Nitara was a wasteSub Zero was wayyy too overpowered in this. In the games Scorpion defeated Bi Han on his own however this movie Cole Young helps Scorpion defeat subzero which completely frustrates me. Like why does this Cole guy get involved in the battle like WTHFinding your inner power is very stupid and dumb.Cole defeating Goro was absolute stupidScorpion being badass should have had more screen time in the film.No mention of Quan Chi killing Scorpion's family 😔, Bi Han was not entirely a bad guy but more of an asshole in the games.Mileena needs more pink in her outfitOverall this movie could have done better without Cole Young, I mean I rather Johnny cage than him. Like I said before This movie wasn't entirely bad it still till this day is the best video game movie as all other video game films have flopped.I do like the 1995 one though some scenes are cheesy, the fights are great though and the whole Sub Zero and Scorpion was not explained properly. There more like slaves of Shang Tsung.I give this new movie an overall of 6 out of 10. There is still a lot that needs fixing and I hope the Sequel starts of in the tournament. I pray to God that there is no Cole and it's just the normal MK characters from the game.",Mortal Kombat
2440,formalunity,Movie vs game.,8,30 April 2021,I think we should take it as a movie and there should be some difference in both of them. The director tried to make this iconic tournament as much realistic as he can and he did it well for a starter. It is not a fighting game but he make it a proper ploted storyline movie. It is surely a great effort and the sequal will shatter all expactations. We should consider it a movie not a fighting game.,Mortal Kombat
2441,isotirakos,Promising trailer terrible movie,1,24 April 2021,"1995 Mortal Kombat movie (whiich was mediocre) feels like a masterpiece when compared to the 2021 version. Acting is terrible, directing is terrible, terrains are terrible and there is no vibe in the movie which the 1995 version strangely succeeded on delivering. Only good this about this movie are the trailers. Those who edited those scenes to make the trailers deserve at least a round of applause. Maybe they should consider making the trailer editors, directors for the next Mortal Kombat movie. Do not watch this unless you are on some kind of drugs and that again is debatable.",Mortal Kombat

Could have been better but it was cool enough to get the movie a 4 rating.Storyline is blah and screenplay is just classic WB stupid.

Bad at so many levels in a technical manner. I'm so disappointed after so many years of waiting.

A Brilliant R18+ Mortal Kombat movie,8,21 April 2021,"As a fan of the games for 29 years this was a great alternate timeline PREQUEL to the first Mortal Kombat game which was is fought on Shang Tsungs island (hopefully in the sequel)Do characters die off early yes, but just like the games no one is truely dead in the MK universe.Look up ""MK revernants.""I like how everyone is training to unlock their powers and the fight scenes that are video game accurate, the humour and fatality's were all a FLAWLESS VICTORY!Check it out.",Mortal Kombat

Considering the budget they film makers had to work with I thought the special effects were very good, especially with the special abilities of the characters. The characters were done very close to the video game. I think the two biggest bright spots of the movie was seeing new characters on screen that we hadn't seen before and the showcase of special abilities of other characters outside of sub zero and scorpion. My biggest issue with the movie was the Cole Young Character. I mean I get why he's there because it makes the story work but I just couldn't get into the guy. I was more interested in all the other characters than him. He was a very bland character and just uninteresting.",Mortal Kombat

2450,office-80976,55 million $ disappointment,4,25 April 2021,"The long-awaited MK 2021, with a budget of $ 55 million, stages rather an apocalyptic scenario without essence, taste, people. The film essentially has a gear of actors taken as if directly from the benches of the acting school and thrown into the arena of the MK circus, with the exception of Hiroyuki Sanada. This film gives you ""fatality"" due to the lack of crowds, and everything happens predictably at all times, between the same interlocutors, like a chess game with 2 characters (good and bad) and a few pawns, on the board. Visual effects, the only pluses, but too little for 2021. The 1995 film is Rolls Royce next to it.",Mortal Kombat

The lore of MK is rich and has many great stories, however the dialogs in the movie are disconnected and scenario and event flow are mediocre. Even the stories within the MK games are far better than the movie.On the good side, fight scenes and the special effects are well-made but they are not enough to compensate the flaws in the rest of the areas.If you watched the Batman movies from Christopher Nolan, you would feel the atmosphere and the emotions like you are living in it.

Now the only few grips I had with it was general reiko I felt that he was over acting way too much (which is weird for a guy with no lines to do), the main character wasn't an established mk character (would have loved it if lu kang was the focus but the lead character kinda grew on me so it's only a minor issue), and finally how sonya got her powers.

It's like they got all the actors from the street and dressed them up as your favorite mortal kombat fighters. I guess they did kano somewhat interesting but all the other characters are so boring and annoying, and then we have Cole. Where can I start with this guy, there is literally no point in him being in the film other than being an annoying, cringe idiot that gets smacked all the time. Also, some fights ended really quickly and easily it makes you think that they didn't have enough resources to make them somewhat descent and they concentrated all their energy on the scorpion vs sub zero fight. Even that could be better if you didn't have Cole there ""helping"". I have lost all hope for a mortal kombat movie, this franchise could be better if it was a netflix series.",Mortal Kombat

(Spoiler) The new character Cole was horrible. He was a direct rip off of Black Panther with his energy absorbing outfit. The movie itself was trying to cram tons of information into it that it assumes people will understand and you only would if you are someone that plays the games or reads the comics. I think that this would do much better as a tv series where they can spend time developing the characters. Also the movie is called Mortal Kombat which is a tournament, they never had the tournament in the movie named after the tournament. It was all about the one faction cheating their way out of the tournament instead. The one area they did improve this time is they at least found a Sonya that looks like she may have taken a martial arts lesson at some point in her life or at least can follow choreography instructions better than the last one. The other was Kano was a big improvement, he was funny and entertaining to watch. I think the movie would have been a complete flop without Kano. There were a couple of entertaining moments but overall I am so disappointed that I have to wait to see if anyone will make another movie or series to redeem what they just did in my lifetime.",Mortal Kombat

2472,mr_honki,Spreading the word! SPOILERS AHEAD!,8,21 April 2021,"What a ride! From the beginning to the end you are strapped in to a non-stop rollercoaster of action and suspense. You can tell the writers have a lot of deep knowledge of the lore of the games. Albeit, some differences to the source material, with every film production, the studio probably wanted it to reach a wider audience rather than just be limited to the fans of the video game/1995 movie. Other than that, before going into the movie, I read a lot of reviews online, saying that the movie was gory, violent, boring, 'beginning of the movie was awesome, rest was s***' - I have to disagree with all of that. The gore and violence is NOTHING compared to the games. If you're expecting blood and guts galore - sorry to disappoint you. Like the production team said - the gore and blood was not tacked on for the sake of the R rating. There was reasoning in each fatality or bloody scene. And not ONCE was I bored or thought the rest of the movie was s***. This movie surprised me in many ways, from the way Sub Zero was portrayed - not sure if this was thanks to James Wan's touch in horror films but man... Sub Zero could have his own horror movie akin to Jason or Michael Myers - big thumbs up!Scorpion on the other hand - to me the Scorpion in THIS movie - was not SCORPION but HANZO HASASHI. Can't believe they got bloody Hiroyuki Sanada to portray HANZO HASASHI. Great casting and writing because it got me emotionally invested in his character. I never thought of Scorpion being that awesome game character that teleports and constantly echoes the iconic quote 'GET OVER HERE'. Oh btw if you're disappointed by how his 'GET OVER HERE' sounds - they made it sound better in the film - i liked it. It wasn't Ed Boon's 'Get over here' but it worked. I love how they used their country of origin languages in the film - Sub Zero being Chinese and Hanzo/Scorpion speaking Japanese - very well detailed and authentic, down to the language spoken.Another surprise was how Kano was written, obviously being a MK fan, we know which side Kano is on, but the way he was written was in no way cliched or 'been there, seen that'. He was definitely a stand-out character brilliantly and naturally portrayed by the Australian comedian Josh Lawson. Well done to you mate  And THAT interaction with KABAL. OMG I tip my hat off to the actor who voiced KABAL - absolutely nailed that character!Another thing I noticed was how much was put into the fight choreography. Especially from the actors i.e. Jessica McNamee who portrayed Sonya Blade. She is an Australian actress whose best work was on an Australian TV show. Haven't seen her other stuff. But to me she came a long way from TV. Nailed the American accent (someone confirm this, I'm Aussie) and she looked like she worked through the same training regime as Liu Kang who was equally buffed up. Their fight scenes look like they were done by stunt doubles cos they were that good at their fight scenes. Knowing that these actors have no martial arts background makes it all the more inspired and appreciated. Well done to these actors.To me, it looked like the production team didn't have much of a budget to work with - and this is the film's downfall. Some characters/scenes did not seem to be fleshed out enough. Some character arcs felt rushed. We're not seeing A+ actors here, but seriously, are we here for the acting or for the story of MK and of course that anthem. But in overlooking these very minor things - like the director said - Enjoy the film. It is DEFINITELY enjoyable. Watching the 1995 movie growing up, especially with that iconic soundtrack - I was just happy to hear that soundtrack back on the big screen. And if you want to support the film and want to see what they can do with a bigger budget on the next film - just watch it on the big screen - nothing is better than hearing that iconic anthem in the theatre.TL;DR - Go and enjoy the film - Thank you WB for making this third film happen. Been waiting since 1997 to see those characters again and listen to that iconic anthem - and I was NOT disappointed. 8/10!",Mortal Kombat

They left out one of the main characters, just to allude to him being in the next movie, like that will be some saving grace for this hot piece of trash. I thought it was clunky, and forced a lot. Kano, was a joke, the actor was amazing, but there was't enough character development between he and Sonya to explain her hatred.Subzero outfit was black, and whoever allowed that to happen doesn't understand about Noob Saibot.Should have gotten actual fans to write the script, and direct, instead of someone who only cares about attention, has no desire to bring the game to life.",Mortal Kombat

2485,tdkhaihcm,A typical VFX action movie,5,9 April 2021,"Since i don't play this game so i will review as a fantasy-genre fan. What i had expected the most before i came to see this film were the actions scenes, the champions creation and the plot. The first two is decent, but the plot destroys them all. The pace of the film is too fast that leads to an insipid story (like Justice League 2017) and i can't see the connection between every events. Got a plane and flight directly to the base without difficulty? Cole agreed to join the gang without any fear and the safe of his family? There're no characters development, or at least they should build a background story for each characters, their feelings throughout the film, how they decide to gather & fight for the earth, their motivations etc but no, everything come naturally like they have to be, the good fight for the good and the bad fight for the bad without thinking. Every time the champions discovered their superpower, i already knew it, and i also knew that Kano would betrayed his gang and then Sonya killed him right at the time i first saw both of them, which makes the film is so predictable. About the power ability of both sides, it's a mess in the fight scenes. In temple, 2 gangs fight each other and every scenes it's just about 1v1? No connection between their fight which leave me a big question mark are they fighting or just teasing & showing off? The outworld gang could have killed the opponents with easily but they just joking, are they seriously fight for their world? They looks so powerful until Raiden & Young come, they become useless villains with no power & wiseness. Even the god of the outworld is useless too. Conclusion: no intense fight, no plot twist, no characters development, no emotion, no deep criteria, no lession we can learn after that. Just a full action movie!",Mortal Kombat

It was always going to be hard to adapt the base mortal kombat story into a movie that the general public will enjoy but they definitely did their best and I think the end result is pretty awesome. There is an awful lot of story to try and fit into the typical movie length but they did very well. Some details had to be skimmed over for sure but it covers the necessary and also has a large amount of action. The pacing was always going to be hard to deal with when you have so many characters to deal with, their backstories, and the story of mortal kombat but it is done well and the film progressively kicks it up into gear and goes full mortal kombat. It's great.If you know the video games, you will be like ""Yeah, this is mortal kombat"" and there's so many moments where you will know what to happen but it is presented in such a way that yeah, it's damn awesome to watch and still leaves enough wiggle room that you can be surprised by the results.If you love action films, you will definitely enjoy it.

But all the lazy storytelling would have been okay if the fights had been exceptional. As is, some of the fights were only okay while others were just ""pretty good"". Now, ""pretty good"" is good enough for most movies but Mortal Kombat is ALL ABOUT the fights, so I expected exceptional fights like those in movies like The Raid or Kingsman. Also, I was expecting more gore. The fatalities were amazing, but the fights leading up to them were basically PG.

2494,roymchunter,Good adaptation and solid foundation for the sequels.,8,26 April 2021,"I watched it twice now in a cinema and I must say it was entertaining. The movie started with solid background story for Sub Zero and Scorpion..with Raiden made an appearance. And then it followed the story of Cole Young, a struggling MMA fighter with his family. After that we were introduced to the other familiar characters of MK such as Sonya, Jax, Kano, Shang Tsung, Reptile, Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Mileena, Goro, Nitara, and Reiko. The movie ended up with fights between the earthrealm and outworld fighters culminating with epic fight between Sub Zero, Scorpion and Cole. The cinematography, fight scenes and CGI are very good..and of course the gory scenes are what the fans needed from this movie and also the catchy techno soundtrack. Yes it has its flaws like any other movies..but overall I was satisfied with the outcome. Can't wait for the sequels..",Mortal Kombat

I loved, LOVED what they did with Scorpion and Sub-Zero, it was just so... awesome. Scorpion is my favorite, by the way.I freaking *loved* this movie. I clapped with approval at the end... by myself... risking waking my sleeping baby next to me and being up for a few more hours. Worth it!

This movie, while yes having some cheese here and there and a couple plot holes and could've done this or that, I feel was a great story and very well executed. And for the addition of Cole.

After watching the whole movie, I can assure it did not live up to my expectations.I don't have full ideas about the background. So my review will be based on solely the movie.There are some plot holes which still are bothering me.Even though Kano is strong, I don't think he is strong enough to walk properly after getting stabbed in the leg by a dragger. He seems perfectly fine. He did not even limp for a sec.When Jax fall from 2/3rd floor, it was shown that he hit his head pretty hard. But later, there were no scratch in his head.After killing Kano, Sonya got the dragon symbol. She gained/unlocked her power within a few mints where's other took many hours to do that.# the screenplay is so bad.# the acting is very bad. I only liked the acting of Jax.

They included some of the lesser known characters.But...I felt the cast was lacking some passion and charisma the original cast brought. It was rushed. It also felt as only a setup for a sequel. The storyline was also a little dull and predictable. NO TRUE TOURNAMENT. As a stand alone, this movie is another failure. It does setup a sequel...which I will be excited to see.Ultimately, it was good.

Mortal Kombat has been a movie that we MK fans have been waiting 25 years for, and it does it job for the most part. Now when Mortal Kombat first came out let's be honest, who really cared about the story back in the day? Yeah, I knew the lore, but I was more focused on learning my characters fatalities and combos.

We have both watched the previous movies before and played the games. This movie is edited so weirdly and the story is stupid. Cole is the dumbest character they added on to this movie. Kano is probably the best part. This movie is so dumb when they try to explain the dragon tattoos and how they get their powers from it. The movie had so many bad edits in it that had me shaking my head wondering what the hell was going on. Don't recommend it.

2537,WhatZitTooya,Fail-tality,5,23 April 2021,"There's no tournament in a movie called ""Mortal Kombat""? Shang Tsung and gang tries to assassinate Earthrealms champions, but that's not the classic plot you may expected from a MK movie. And it takes about an hour something happens in this film. That hour before there's only exposition, characters walk in some unspectacular desert locations and boring training sequences you want to skip next time.Kano wins! Josh Lawson seems like the only actor, who had really fun and can get more out of his role. Hiroyuki Sanada is a great Scorpion, but they gave him absolutely none screentime. The Action and the effects were quite awesome, as well as the cosplay. Joe Taslim did a great job as Sub-Zero. The beginning and his fight with Scorpion were the best parts. If you can mix the gory action of this reboot with the enjoyable characters from the Original, it would be a really good MK movie. Overall it was watchable and partly entertaining enough to give it an average rating. The animated movie last year is still the best MK movie out there yet.",Mortal Kombat

2540,nnebbia,"Worth the watch if you're a fan, yet disappointed!",6,24 April 2021,"Where do I begin?...well as a huge MK fan, i like the idea that they developed the scorpion-sub-zero saga as the main storyline(or atleast tried to). However, im a little lost with Cole Young. I get he has Hanzo's lineage, but why just throw a new character in the movie? Where was Johnny Cage? I know he's gonna be in the sequel, but if you're gonna stay mostly with the same story you have in every other MK movie, short, animation, why not roll with Johnny Cage? And where was Kitana? Kano was a major bright spot. They really nailed it with this version of him, IMO. Cole's character felt forced and it turned Liu Kang to a roll player. A ROLL PLAYER. The actor playing Hanzo; Hiroyuki Sanada, is way too, old, little and weak-looking to play Scorpion. Yet Bi-Han looked like a badass... Overall the story was slow to develop. Not to mention the lack of a an actual tournament. AND AGAIN, Liu Kang was reduced to a minor character. Like what?!?!... Kano was the best part of the movie. With all that said, If you're a fan, it is still 100% worth the watch.",Mortal Kombat

2543,droppinmonkeys,Good but not great,8,23 April 2021,"My first exposure to Mortal Kombat was the Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe on the PS3 and I loved that game, I played it a ton with some of my friends when we were kids and as I've grown up I have distanced myself from the series but I was like ""hey a MK movie, wonder what it will be like"" so yeah.Well to start off, the fighting, action, choreography, special effects were all spectacular as you might expect from a movie about Mortal Kombat. The casting was meh, the picks for Sonya, Jax, SubZero, Scorpion, Raiden and Kano were very good. But the rest of the characters were rather underwhelming or just awful(looking at you Shang Tsung), whether it be bad acting or bad writing or a combination of both. They were very bland and the main character was just alright. But the real standout of the movie was Kano, he made the movie for me, he was very well written and the actor did a fantastic job. He was hilarious at all the right times, hurling insults at every person he could, giving jokes whenever he could, perfectly arrogant, had good action scenes, always gave good scenes, great introduction, super self aware and it all made the character perfect. The other highlight character for me was SubZero, really good casting and every scene with him was great, he was like a horror character. You would see little ice shards popping up and you would know that it was about to be a bad time for the other characters. Most scenes that did not contain either of them was a little bit of a disappointment (that was not a fight). The casting for Shang Tsung was horrific, terrible choice and it sucked some of the life out of the scenes he was in, ""yay subzero is here, good fight about to happen"" *shang tsung appears* ""pain"" or something along those lines. Some of the fights were underwhelming mostly because it contained a character that we know nothing about (at least I do not) or they were short or had poor editing.Overall, the only true gripes I had about the movie (considering it was the directors first big movie and the budget constraints) was the lack of the tournament. The movie is just a big prologue to the next movie about the tournament and that did not sit well with me. Also the main character, Cole, was just very bland, underwhelming, lame and seemed like a weird addition.",Mortal Kombat
2544,bratsu,Long time fan. Lots of love but left me needing more.,7,27 April 2021,"So I've played the game since MK1 was out on arcades. I have grown up with these characters like many of you. The film is a fantastic reboot but it does need a bit of tweaking. The cast all around was really great and did fantastic work. Some of the fights seemed way too ....I dunno....robotic? It just seemed like there wasn't a natural flow. Some of the fights just came on far too fast without giving these characters much of their needed back story. I feel like they sidelined alot of the fighters gorgeous storylines for this new Cole character. Some of the villains deserved more love too. Reiko was just terrible first and foremost. You can't pop in these characters that are huge characters in the game and comics but then give us what they gave with Reiko. Same with Nitara, like wtf? Mileena was absolutely stunning!!! She gave me everything I needed but, once again, they didn't give us anything with her story. Visuals were okay, but lemme tell you, the flame visuals were absolutely atrocious. I'm like really? Ice effects, gorgeous. The flame effects, preschool. I think my biggest complaint is the complete lack of lore, and lack of story. If you can't add to the depth of these fighters then you need to figure out a way to do so because we needed to hear so much more from the villains side. Everyone deserves to know where Mileena came from, who Reiko is, who Nitara is. The non gamers need to know that Sub Zero is a title, and that other members can, and will, become the next Sub Zero. They focused
the best details pretty much entirely on the two faces of MK, and they did a fantastic job with Scorpion, aside from the fire FX. The fighting between the two was quite superb and im glad they gave then the limelight but i fear these two characters took away from the others a bit. All in all it was great and I'm so happy we got a reboot. I just hope they can pace things out better in the future. Let the characters have some growth in the future so when we see someone get a fatality we feel for whoever it is instead of it being more of a ""well alrighty then, why did we even need to learn their names?"" Oh and can SOMEONE please tell me where the super Jax arms just magically popped up from? Once again, they explained the hard lined points of the story but gave us no extra in anyway. There just wasn't much depth to the film beyond the story behind Hanzo and Bi Han.",Mortal Kombat

A great build up to a story about to unfold.The biggest disappointed is they brought in a pointless, lead character that no one wanted. There are several solid characters from MK that they could have developed in this movie. You already have fan favorites that were in the movie that didn't get nearly enough development, were under utilized. It was like they just threw them in the movie to simply say they're in the movie only for them to only have 3-4min screen time and no chance for them to be in a sequel.Within the last 30min or so of the movie suddenly this trash, washed up MMA fighter, gets a dumb ""power"", and now he's leading the crew to fight off Shang Tsung and co? Just doesn't make sense. It was like they disregarded Liu and Kung's history in the MK as champions.The fighting overall was pretty fun and added a couple ""fatalities"". Scorpion and Sub-Zero were the highlights.I really wish movie writers would stick to canon stories though when doing game adaptions.",Mortal Kombat

2560,kingofkreas,"Blood, gore and entertainment? GET OVER HERE!",7,22 April 2021,"If you're a fan of MK then there's plenty here for you - the Scorpion/Sub-Zero backstory given the big screen stage for the first time, Kano stealing the show with his absurd humour, plenty of screen-time for favourites like Sonya, Jax and, er, Cole Young...............but most importantly actual Mortal Kombat style fatalities (missing in the 1995 and 1997 movies).If you're not a fan of MK I feel the jumbled plot line with tattoo's/birthmarks/acana's (akana's??) and random introduction of characters will confuse you (Nitara lol), while there are moments with seemingly non-stop fighting scenes that could have used an extra breath here and there.Overall, I was content with MK and pleasantly surprised with the route they took for the ending. As a fan of the series, biggest thumbs up has to go to the portrayal of Sub-Zero. They absolutely knocked it out of the park with him, building him very nicely as the main villain of the movie.On the downside, I feel the movie left a lot to be desired for Shang Tsung and Raiden. The way these two characters - supposedly main characters - were shown made them appear as barely sideshow additions to the movie. Where 1995 Mortal Kombat lacked in gore, it at the very least made up for it with solid screen time and character building for Raiden and Shang Tsung. Here, not so much, but perhaps it is something to look forward to in a possible sequel to this!",Mortal Kombat
2561,jonpieciak,What you'd expect,7,24 April 2021,We all wanted a new Mortal Kombat with new technology and adapting to how the games have become over the years and I think that's exactly what we got. I would of liked to see them explore a different maybe darker approach to tell the story line but it's a classic story for a reason. Action packed the whole time which was great and the Easter egg nods to the games and original movie was awesome. The acting could have been much better. Kano and Liu Kang I thought gave the best performances. I would have loved more Scorpion. So it's a 7 for me. It's exactly what I wanted I do just wish it was shot a little better and the acting was more natural. Hope they make a second one.,Mortal Kombat

-Really clear explanations of the whole ML story and concept for first-time viewersBad:

2573,exodia777,"Full of miscast, bad plot, details that gone off, ok CG",2,30 April 2021,"I cant stand this bad casting. Worst casting was Shang Tsung, the guy looked too friendly to be a soul sucking evil master of outer realm. He looked like a friendly neighbor who is father of two... couldnt focus in his character at all. Switching between his regular eyes and blk circle lenz eyes were hilarious. Main guy looked little too slim and weak. Kano was a complete joke. Liu Kang looked like a juvenile playing with fire. Sub zero cast had a good fit though with that icy look.Now few details that completely was a turn off. Liukang's fatality move is to become a dragon and bite off the body of the enemy, not make magical flame dragon and torch up the enemy in oil. Goro is supposed to be super human strength villain and the main guy withstand his beating and choking in regular human form. Raiden puts up his lightening defense but Shang Tsung and his champs were already in Raiden's base and they just leave.Now the plot.. tried too hard to make scorpion into picture in short time. The movie makes audience believe that main guy will eventually become the scorpion since he often gets this flashback of bloody Kunai (scorpion's weapon) but actually his great great great grandfather suddenly comes out from hell as scorpion.. I cant think of any worse plot than that. Oh yea, there's no tournament, the latter half of movie is all about Shang Tsung trying to assassinate earth champions few times with his champs.Overall, 1995 movie was much better.

The fatalities are intense, music is unique yet still familar feeling, even the campiness is well done. People seem to not like Cole because he isn't in the series but I think the character helps the storyline progress. Also some complain that Kano is more ""likeable"" but it adds depth to his character. My only criticism is so minimal that it's barely worth mentioning. I feel like the Goro scene could have done with warmer light to show the model better, the cooler tone makes him look a bit washed out to me. But that's it really. Overall it's great.",Mortal Kombat
2575,shang_tsung_10,Atrocious attempt to re-adapt Mortal Kombat,1,22 April 2021,"I have a special place for Mortal Kombat in my heart. Besides being my favourite videogame series, its 1995 adaptation happens to be my favourite film as well. The original movie taught me many things including the discovery of my love for martial arts, mysticism, asian culture and exotic locations. The announcement of a brand new interpretation of the source material has been on a rocky road since it was announced a couple years ago and finally after a long period of silence, ""Mortal Kombat"" (2021) is ready to hit the big screen once again.Story: It is evident that Greg Russo's and Dave Callaham's main purpose for developing a new MK film was to slap an R-rating forgetting how rich the established mythos is or what the fans really like and want (besides gore). Following to the letter the (infamous) leaked script, they are making amateur mistakes: they introduce a new character that has nothing to do with the franchise as a vessel that is being dumped copious amounts of exposition; they take further liberties with the material by having our heroes unlocking their potential superhuman fighting abilities which mangles an already overpopulated plot that is plagued with gigantic plotholes. These ideas are the weakest aspects of a rather lame attempt to bring the MK world to life. Cole Young (the new guy) is so blunt that derails the attention from the main attractions (i.e., the other more interesting characters) with a shoehorned family backstory that further lengths the running time and disabling any tension.The script tries to balance too many characters with little to no explanation as to who they are along a steadily increasing pace that halfway through you lose interest (even when they are fighting) because there is really no emotional pay off. Instead of bringing some much needed dramatic heft and verbal counterpoint, the tournament story is scrapped by having Shang Tsung attacking Raiden's headquarters - resulting in simultaneous fights leaving no room for natural progression to understand these proceedings. The script is so messy that we are not even geographically oriented.The inclusion of an overly serious tone damages the film stripping its story from you know...any fun (despite some forced jokes). Attempting to keep things grounded in a similar fashion with what Nolan did with his Batman trilogy, this ""Mortal Kombat"" is an exercise to futility. A desaturated mess of lore, new concepts, and characters that barely have something to say and even less to do. There is no dramatic tension, and no special obstacles to overcome followed by a sense of ""let's wrap things up"" in a boring climax that instead of awe, you get a yawn. There is nothing memorable on a visual level, or a banal moral example demonstrating the unfamiliarity with the material from the screenwriters' part.Direction and action: Simon McQuoid is clearly inexperienced in shooting a film. He is unable not only to extract any meaningful or playful performances (as opposed to the '95 flick) but also incompetent at shooting action. There are myriads of cuts and close ups during the numerous (but surprisingly short) fight sequences that betray this sentiment coupled with rather embarrassing CGI (both blood and creature) effects. After the ""Raid"" (having in a way better role Joe - Subzero - Taslim) and ""John Wick"" series demonstrated incredible practical stunt work and real time fighting, ""Mortal Kombat"" pales in comparison with atrocious editing that tries in vain to masquerade inexperienced actors, slow movements and shoddy CGI environments which is even worse when an experienced to martial art movies cinematic eye catches a glimpse. The fights lack any visual flair that made the original's sequence a joy to watch which is not helped by poor cinematography and uninspired small sound stages. Despite some initially promising results at the village fight (which is still plagued by bizarre editing choices; used the same shot twice!) helped by Taslim's athletic abilities, the film sinks like Titanic. Every fight becomes shorter and less interesting lacking any visual innovation or grittiness - fighters like Mileena, Reiko, Kabal, Jaxx, Goro, Nitara and Kung Lao offer nothing more than a couple of moves.Cast: To be fair to the cast, they do seem dedicated in their roles but their uncertainty as to how they should approach this material (and those lines) is telling while their chemistry is non existent. Excluding Josh Lawson (as the typical profanity loving Aussie douchebag Kano) who is clearly having a ball with the material and attempts to steal the show (maybe too much sometimes), the rest are torn between embracing the material or reject it.Ludi Lin (Liu Kang) has no presence (he is tiny) and from main character status (in the game), he is being reduced to a secondary player paling in comparison with the great Robin Shou who delivered an incredible physical performance. Jesicca McNamee looks the Sonya Blade part and has more screentime now but gets a bizarre arc of wanting to be an Earth's champion and hence staying in the sidelines for most of the time. For Lord Raiden, while Christopher Lambert knew how ridiculous the source material was and gave us a now iconic take - voice, mannerisms, dry humour - the filmmakers cast Tadanobu Asano, a decision primarily driven by ethnicity appeal rather than crafting an interesting character. Asano is playing Raiden straight, yet he does not have enough or any appropriate material to work with.But most importantly, there is no Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa. This version of Shang Tsung (Chin Han) seems to be coming from the discount store, lacking any menace, memorable lines or delivery reestablishing at how important is to have an intimidating villain that can carry the burden of the antagonist in the whole film. Instead our primary villain becomes Subzero (Joe Taslim) with his conveniently inconsistent (when the script demands) ice powers. Taslim tries his best and while he has a certain cinematic presence, his physique is not fully exploited. His hyped relationship with his opposite Scorpion (Hiroyuki Sanada) is one noted and is never explored. He is just evil (who speaks English when the scripts requires him to do so). The legendary Sanada on the other hand takes on a thankless role and similarly like Raiden is reduced to a borderline cameo.And then there is Cole with Tan proving that he does not have enough charisma to lead a film and delivering one of the most boring performances of the last ten years. The rest are just line outputs for the plot to move forward with some not even getting more than five lines!Production design and costumes: The rather minimalistic production design only makes matters worse. What could have been a tremendous opportunity to showcase unique locations around Australia for this perilous outworld, devolved into a studio shoot in the city of ... Adelaide. Despite a rather ok opening in a remote Japanese village (with one house!) in the 17th century, ""Mortal Kombat"" is packed with bizarre stylistic choices that raise an eyebrow even in the first screening (e.g., Raiden's temple has a electrical like coil at its centre, Shang Tsung's throne is an rocky elevated place that is hanging above a cliff, Reptile is an actual ... reptile). There is a distinct lack of eye candy that does not captivate our attention demonstrating a void of creativity. While the costumes are above those in ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"", they still look like expensive pieces of cosplay - particularly for those of Liu Kang, Kung Lao and Shang Tsung. Only Kabal's visual look is faithful to the source material but then again he is in there for five minutes.Music: Benjamin Wallfisch - from the school of the Hans Zimmer pompous synthesized music - is the composer failing to delivering anything interesting. Having to fill the shoes of George S. Clinton in the original (which saw the use of taiko drums, shakuhachi flutes, violas and Tivetan throat monks), Wallfisch utilizes an array of ambient electronic and percussion like sounds with no distinct personality. This results to a cacophonous score, a wasted opportunity to craft something truly blood pumping and mystical. His zimmerisms are full on display here, an ultimately vague attempt that frankly so many blockbusters are lately falling prey to. His work here is noisy and incoherent, lacking any distinct themes, rhythm or subtle moments.Special effects: Funny for a film that includes special superpowers, the filmmakers are doing their best to hold back. Besides some nifty touches on Subzero's powers (which is probably where most of their budget was spent), the remaining shots are lackluster at best. The creature effects are shoddy and unrealistic (Goro is an embarassment) while cases where our heroes or villains demonstrated their skills do not look beyond TV quality level. And the less we talk about the CGI enhanced environments, the better.Verdict: The comparisons with the '95 film are inevitable and whereas that adaptation was constantly raising the dramatic stakes with each fight allowing us to explore a different side of the Outworld, this Kombat is a monotonous and lackluster attempt to establish a new franchise. With the exception of Josh Lawson, there was nothing that I enjoyed in this film. Devoid from any fun and character, coupled with subpar acting, atrocious editing, terrible stylistic choices and an overly serious tone, ""Mortal Kombat"" is not the film you are looking for, not even for the action department. If you do like Joe Taslim see him in ""The night comes for us"" in Netflix. There are buckets of actual gore (not CGI) and actual fighting that would leave you speechless. Else seek out the original cult adaptation, enjoy Tagawa and Lambert and have a blast from the 90s!",Mortal Kombat
2576,wise_chelsea,Disappointed die hard fan,2,1 May 2021,There was waaaaayy too much material that could've been used in this movie to make a better plot. The main character was pointless.

This movie is world building and introducing characters into a more realistic world.For the lovers of the game, there are plenty of Easter eggs to enjoy, my particular favourite was the repeated sweep which my brother use to do to me all the time in MK1.What came across as a downfall of the movie was it was too short. I feel like they didn't spend enough time on things that had happened to build more tension and suspence.

The action is there, and the nods to MK fanfare are abundant. But it really is not a great movie that won't win any awards. The acting is fairly mediocre apart from Kano who is the best part of the movie. I think MK could have been a lot better had their been more character development.I'd have loved to see why Subzero hates the Hasashi bloodline so much and why he wants to destroy it even after centuries. Why?Why did Scorpion descend into hell? What did he learn there? How did he know to emerge from hell at just that precise moment? No buildup and just happened very suddenly with no explanation.How did the tournaments begin and what is the deal with these other realms fighting in it? It doesn't seem to have any rules because Shang Tsung can just flout the rules and engage earthrealm before it officially begins.Who is Kabal, Millenna, Gora, etc? I get it we know their names... but who are they and how did they end up in Outworld?Who are the elder gods? We know Raiden is one of them (I think...) who controls time and space. If Raiden is so powerful why doesn't he just obliterate Outworld?

2598,veryoldsnake,A lot of fan service but that's about it,6,24 April 2021,"OverviewSome decent fight scenes, sub par acting, rushed plot to cram in as many things as possible, bad decision to include a new character as main protagonist (if they wanted to link him to Scorpion, why not Takeda? Or even why not include Kenshi!?), weird choices for side characters (Nitara!? I mean really? Nitara? Out of all the roster throughout almost 3 decades and they choose Nitara to be in but once again make Reptile a lizard monster instead of an actual humanoid ninja with his reptilian powers)The good:Few decent fight scenesMK goreCertain characters are well done like Sub Zero, Scorpion and KanoFan service scenes and lines from the game for the MK fanaticsThe bad:Sub par actingUnnecessary and boring main character who is not even an original MK characterRushed and disjointed plot, the film sets up for a tournament but there is not actual tournament but random fights in random placesToo many random characters with no purpose behind them (freaking Goro is sent to kill the main character like a normal goon by Shang Tsung)ConclusionHonestly i did not expect much. I was entertained for certain parts but it could have been much better. Of course it sets up for a sequel but honestly i wish they could just focus on a few characters only and not 15. And stick with a simpler but more concise.",Mortal Kombat
2599,soumitromanmalviya,Action was on point but story was off,8,26 April 2021,"I actually feel disconnected throughout the movie because i have seen Legends of Scorpio and stories are way different than each outher. I don't know the actual story but that animation movie was on point (i think) although the action and brutality was flawless, In case of thrilling action scenes this movie doesn't disappoint you and also CG was great through the movie except at some points
Overall this is a good movie, i enjoyed it very much.#Fatality #Flawless Victory.",Mortal Kombat
2600,monezweminn-92701,Screenplay could have been better!,1,28 April 2021,"Except for Kano, all other characters are almost flat, unmotivated, and undynamic. Unprogressive conflict, the protagonist isn't really struggling. Obstacles are not formidable enough. So many unnecessary scenes which do not actually push the story forward.",Mortal Kombat
2601,muhamadshawki,Truly disappointed,1,29 April 2021,"I've been disappointed seriously, the part I, II is far better than this one
For more than 15 years I've been waiting for the new MK with the current technology and graphics, it's a shame guys, few characters, no story, random shots, unknown stars, even if you want to get new stars just bring some with charisma, only kano and the rest are bad
The main character scorpion only 2 scenes it's really disappointing matter
Seriously this is Liu kang?And the idea of Shang tsung is any Mongolian face with with black eyes?It's a disaster and waste of money and time
I'm truly sad.",Mortal Kombat
2602,tmmike,Heard there's plans to make this a trilogy,2,25 April 2021,"So, my initial rating was 5/10, because - hey, they at least tried. Today I read an article unveiling plans to make this 2h long extremely boring movie into a trilogy, which consequently led me to rate it 2/10 as that's what it really deserved.The actor playing Raiden made me constantly think about struggljng rice farmers out in rural China, he was by no means imposing/godlike and his 5-10 lines were all absolutely bloody horrible.There was absolutely no story around Lu Kang (the chosen one) and no sweet interactions between him and the rice farmer, pardon me, I meant Raiden.I have no idea why they felt the need to introduce a whole new fighter and invent a role for him when there's so much awesome and juice MK lore already out there.Where was Sindel, Baraka, the Khan ( you know which one ), where was Johny Cage??? Man, even Johnny Cage couldn't float this boat, everything was on fire.To top it all off, there was no Mortal Kombat, and I doubt they could recover this bad start within the span of trilogy. It's just... all wrong, throw it in a bin somewhere and forget it ever existed.",Mortal Kombat
2603,loganpurdon-27226,"Good movie. Few problems, but overall good.",10,24 April 2021,"It had a few cringey movies, but nothing too bad. The fight scenes were pretty good, and Kano had a lot of funny dialogue. My only real complaint is that they spoiled Scorpion coming back in the trailer and poster, but I guess it was obvious he would anyway.",Mortal Kombat
2604,edgar-69048,Just fine... Not awesome.,4,25 April 2021,"Gotta say it's kinda entertaining, but for the fans (like me), it felt like Joss Whedon's JL, lots of characters but no time for backgrounds. No time to build the characters, instead, the used all the resources on a character that doesn't exist in the game. The ""MMA fighter descendent of Hasashi"" didn't work for me. The ""long sleeve power"" was meh. Now Jax and Sonya. No Special Forces? They were looking for champions just because? Jax's arms come from shaolin monks? Why wasn't Liu Kang the main character? Instead they made him a secondary character and almost a teenager.Kano was perfect.Good CGI, though. Goro was kinda ""Hulk looking"", made me miss the animatronic of MK 1995. Overall, it is nice, but do not expect awesome.",Mortal Kombat
