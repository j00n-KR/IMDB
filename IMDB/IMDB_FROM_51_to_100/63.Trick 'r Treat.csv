0,Leofwine_draca,Engaging portmanteau,7,3 March 2012,"TRICK 'R TREAT is a wonderful anthology film set during one Halloween night that best resembles the highs of the George Romero anthology CREEPSHOW. In other words, it's the kind of old-fashioned horror film of the kind you thought they didn't make anymore, and it's pleasing to see this was well received on its release.In total, there are five separate stories taking place. There's a slight wraparound tale about a Halloween-hater who learns that certain forces aren't best pleased when she refuses to get into the spirit of things. The second story, and my personal favourite, finds Dylan Baker excelling as a kid-hating headteacher up to some murky business in his back garden. Baker, one of those geeky-looking actors usually wasted in supporting roles, finally gets a chance with a role he can really sink his teeth into and he has a ball with it.The third story involves a woodland all-female party menaced by a vampire, with a notable twist, while the fourth, and most elaborate, involves a bunch of trick 'r treaters investigating a local legend about a submerged school bus. The final story is a virtual reprise of EVIL DEAD II, with Brian Cox of all people taking on the Bruce Campbell role, playing a miser who finds himself menaced in his own home by a sinister pumpkin-headed spirit.These stories don't play out singularly but are instead mixed together, overlapping in places and tying together in others. Although the effect isn't as well achieved as in something like the indie film 11:14, I found it added to the quality immeasurably. Dougherty pulls together a cast who give it their all, and I can't tell you how refreshing it is to find a horror film that doesn't involve masked slashers or people being tortured. TRICK 'R TREAT is a rare beast indeed and a movie that's definitely worth tracking down.",Trick 'r Treat
1,SnoopyStyle,surprisingly good,7,31 March 2018,"It is Halloween in the small town of Warren Valley, Ohio. These are stories of various people during that night as a mysterious childlike trick or treater lurk. Emma (Leslie Bibb) insists on taking down the Halloween decoration despite her husband's objections. School principal Steven Wilkins (Dylan Baker) kills a bratty candy stealing chubby kid. Laurie (Anna Paquin), her older sister Danielle (Lauren Lee Smith), and their two female friends arrive in town to go to a party. Laurie is teased by the others for being a virgin. Scared Rhonda rides the elevator down into a quarry and becomes the subject of a prank by four schoolmates. Mr. Kreeg (Brian Cox) is a grumpy old man who hates Halloween.There are about five stories in this movie. One is amazing. Two have great things in it. The other two are perfectly acceptable Halloween vignettes. All in all, this is solid Halloween fare. The little central character has a nice design although he may work better simply lurking in the background. It's more creepy that he exists in this cauldron of madness rather than being a killer monster. The one amazing story is Anna Paquin's little red riding hood. They totally fooled me and it's a great twist. If anything, I consider making that a more central part of the movie. Next, the elevator to the quarry is great for the elevator. It's something I've never seen or even considered before. It's an unreal idea that actually adds to the creepiness. As for Principal Wilkins, I like the chubby brat. He's very kill worthy. He's bratty and soft. As for Leslie Bibb and Brian Cox, they are functional slasher chum meat. They could be more inventive but they are perfectly fine. This is surprisingly good in a horror franchise which I know little about.",Trick 'r Treat
2,Horst_In_Translation,Don't know where exactly this is going,4,4 November 2015,"""Trick 'r Treat"" is an American movie from 8 years ago written and directed by Michael Dougherty, who is mostly known for his work on the X-Men franchise. Here, however, he is back to his roots as his very first work was a Halloween-themed short film and he picks up one character from that one for his feature film here as well. This movie is pretty short, does stay considerably under 80 minutes if you don't count the credits. And still, it is basically 5 stories in one movie. This is also where my first criticism applies. It may have worked better if they had completely split this up in 5 short films or not even made this one movie, but 5 independent short films, because sadly, the connections and intertwining between these several segments are very vague and not particularly credible.Another problem I had with this film is the lack of focus. I generally enjoy horror movies more if they are 100% horror. This one is not. It is at least 50% comedy apart from the supernatural aspects. And finally, I did not think the acting was particularly good. Dylan Baker, of course, is a delight as always, truly talented actor who is almost wasted in this film here. Anna Paquin I am once again disappointed with. She seems really hammy and I cannot see any crucial differences in her many performances in recent years. She always looks exactly the same in terms of her mannerisms etc. when acting. Of course she does not get help from the script either, which on the one hand tries to convince us she is an innocent virgin and on the other hand shows her climbing on men in a lustful manner while they are lying on the ground. Doesn't make sense at all. All in all, nothing great to see here (apart from Baker) and it's pretty disappointing as the cast looks promising. Not even a great watch for Halloween. Many better choices out there.",Trick 'r Treat
3,claudio_carvalho,There Are Rules in Halloween,8,23 October 2009,"In the Halloween night in Warren Valley, Ohio, Emma (Leslie Bibb) blows out a Jack-o-Lantern in front of her home despite the remark of her husband Henry (Tahmoh Penikett); sooner she has a tragic surprise. Earlier, the virgin Laurie (Anna Paquin) buys a Little Red Riding Hood costume with her sister and two girlfriends and they invite some guys for a party. Meanwhile, the glutton Charlie (Bret Kelly) destroys many Jack-o-Lanterns on the street. When he arrives at the house of the high- school principal Steven (Dylan Baker), the boy discovers how much the disturbed man respects the dead and the traditions of Halloween. Meanwhile four teenagers invite the outcast Rhonda (Sam Todd) to join them in their journey to an abandoned rock quarry where a tragic accident with the school bus with eight troubled children happened thirty years ago. They play a prank with Rhonda but when the mean Marcy (Britt McKillip) blows out the last Jack-o-Lantern in the spot, they need the support of Rhonda to escape from the damned place. Laurie sees a stalker that follows her; while walking through the woods to the party, she is attacked and she finally has her initiation. Earlier, the lonely Mr. Kreeg (Brian Cox) lives alone with his dog Spite and is visited by a scary trick-or-treating creature.""Trick 'r Treat"" is one of the best (if not the best) movie about the legend and traditions of Halloween. In my country, this pagan holiday is not celebrated; therefore my only knowledge of this date is through the horror movies. But the writer and director Michael Dougherty succeeds in telling five entwined stories in the suburb of a small town in Ohio in the night of Halloween blending tension and black humor but keeping the tension and the mystery. The cinematography is beautifully scary and the performances of the magnificent cast with names like Brian Cox, Dylan Baker and Anna Pasquin are excellent. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Contos do Dia das Bruxas"" (""Tales of the Halloween"")",Trick 'r Treat
4,kosmasp,Tales from the (Halloween) Crypt,8,25 October 2009,"Well there is not actually a crypt, but the movie that has several story lines, that will keep you on the edge, has a very familiar feeling. And still manages to be fresh and cool. You have really good actors (not only Brian Cox, who's storyline I liked the most), but also a script that can hold all those story lines together, without giving away too much.What really elevates this movie too, is the fact, that the story lines aren't told separately, but you get thrown in and out of them every now and then. So the editing is/was very crucial. And it delivers greatly! If you are a horror fan and like your movies to be funny and scary at the same time (without being politically correct), watch this movie! One of the best Halloween themed movies for quite some time!",Trick 'r Treat
5,gavin6942,Should Have Been in Theaters,8,30 August 2011,"Four interwoven stories that occur on Halloween: An everyday high school principal has a secret life as a serial killer; a college virgin might have just met the one guy for her; a group of teenagers pull a mean prank; a woman who loathes the night has to contend with her holiday-obsessed husband.From director Michael Dougherty (whom I almost met in Chicago) and starring Anna Paquin as Red Riding Hood, with music from Marilyn Manson... this is just the perfect Halloween film, the best since ""Halloween"" thirty years earlier. Halloween always looks cooler in the movies than real life...we need to decorate more out here in the suburbs! I loved the character of Sam, and hope to see more of him in the sequel. I also liked the nasty fat kid vomiting! Not because I like vomiting, but because horror films need to be edgy, and I think no one saw this coming -- so much vomit from such a (relatively) small kid.",Trick 'r Treat
6,Woodyanders,Superior Halloween-themed horror anthology winner,8,27 October 2012,"Four horror stories centering on October 31st: Nerdy high school principal Steven (a pleasingly creepy turn by Dylan Baker) moonlights as a vicious serial killer; sweet young virgin Laurie (an excellent and appealing performance by the lovely Anna Paquin) tries to find Mr. Right with gruesome results; a group of teens pull a cruel prank on a strange girl with disastrous consequences; and cranky old coot Mr. Kreeg (a marvelously cantankerous portrayal by Brian Cox) receives a special home visit from mischievous trick-or-treating demon Sam (the adorable Quinn Lord). Writer/director Michael Dougherty relates the entertaining segments at a brisk pace, delivers a handy helping of gore, offers several inspired moments of wickedly funny pitch-black humor, and caps off each vignette with a dandy ghoulish surprise twist. Moreover, Dougherty not only vividly captures the fun spooky ooga-booga midnight-in-the-graveyard spirit of the Halloween season, but also manages to make all the tales overlap and interconnect in a clever and enjoyable way that gives this film an extra satisfying cohesion that a fair share of omnibus fright features tend to lack. Glen MacPherson's crisp widescreen cinematography provides a strikingly sumptuous look. The shivery score by Douglas Pipes hits the stirring spine-tingling spot. A total treat.",Trick 'r Treat
7,BA_Harrison,Don't believe the hype!,5,15 October 2009,"Trick 'r Treat is director Michael Dougherty's long awaited stab at creating a new seasonal favourite in the vein of George Romero's EC-style anthology Creepshow; but with a collection of stories that barely reach the standard of that film's 'The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill', and an unnecessary non-linear narrative, Dougherty fails to hit his target.The main problem is the unimaginative and predictable stories themselves, which attempt to combine scares and laughs, but which fail on both counts; the Pulp Fiction-style storytelling technique, which chops and changes from one vaguely connected character to another, only serves to dilute their effectiveness even further. Horror comic tales work so well BECAUSE of their linear format: there's the build up which segues into the suspense, and is topped off by the sudden, shocking pay-off (usually featuring some kind of fitting punishment for a nasty character combined with a ghoulish moral). Separate these elements, and you've robbed the story of its power.On a more positive note, Dougherty does succeed in conjuring up some lovely Halloween themed imagery, making the most of his beautifully detailed set design and delivering a strong Autumnal atmosphere; his cast all give credible performances, doing the best they possibly can with the material; and seasoned horror fans will at least have fun spotting the many sly tributes to genre classics scattered throughout the film.But those who have heard that this is a modern masterpiece, destined to become a Halloween classic, should be prepared to be very disappointed. 4.5 out 10, rounded up to 5 for the presence of Anna Paquin and her tasty, pillow-chested friends.",Trick 'r Treat
8,Quinoa1984,"This is Halloween, This is Halloween!",8,7 November 2009,"Michael Dougherty shouldn't have to suffer studio fools, but he did for about two years. His first feature film as director, Trick 'r Treat, was left out of the slate of movies from October 2007 because of *gasp* Saw IV! As it turns out, two years later, Saw has been shown up by two actually effective horror movies: Paranormal Activity, and this film, kicking ass on video. While one could still feel sorry for Dougherty for not getting a theatrical release, it's also most refreshing to see that it works just as well on the small screen. Maybe an added touch is that it can work immediately for those wanting a ""party"" movie: turn down the lights, have some popcorn and beers (or sodas), and watch with giddiness as an assortment of characters get into mishaps and danger on a night that begs for a movie to call its own. There's still John Carpenter's classic, and Tim Burton's 'Nightmare', but this is up there.Indeed it could just as well be called Halloweentown, as it's not so much about any one character or story but about the nature of Halloween on people, the entire aspect of a trick being played if a treat isn't around. That, or just monsters and ghosts and maniacs let loose on the night. It's set in an unnamed American town where pumpkins are everywhere, and almost everyone is wearing a costume. Stories intertwine and come back around more out of Go than Creepshow: a principal (Baker) of a school kills a kid who comes onto his property, having some trouble burying the body (he later as other troubles too, which I double dare not mention here); a Little Red Riding Hood (Paquin) is off to find a boy that her friend has set up for her, with a twist that is kind of shocking and mostly full of awesome; a group of kids go to a rock quarry to see about the story of a bus driver who took his bus full of ""wayward"" kids off a cliff; and an old miser (Cox) is given the serial-killer treatment by a little fellow in a burlap sack.Dougherty is respectful of the anthology-horror format, calling back to things like Creepshow, Fear(s) of the Dark or Tales from the Darkside. But he's also interested in pushing buttons and not backing down from giving and building on good scares, no matter how disturbing it might get. This is one of the reasons of the film was delayed due to a problem the studio had with child deaths (albeit never is a raised eyebrow given for the hordes of teens slaughtered in horror, or for that matter any given Saw slice). But Dougherty uses any shock value for the sake of pure chilling entertainment - you might not be fully as scared or creeped out like by Halloween, and some may be more innovative in the storytelling or gore, yet on its own terms it does its job as well as it should.All the acting is terrific- that goes for the younger actors such as in the Rock Quarry Bus Ghost story, and even Baker's character's brat son- and the craftsmanship is FAR beyond the call of duty for what would ever expect a straight-to-video release, to say the least. It's like getting a slew of really strong campfire stories, and at the end of each one you can never be too sure if it's real or not because, well, what is behind that tree or around the corner anyway?",Trick 'r Treat
9,BandSAboutMovies,How did I miss this?,8,31 October 2018,"How did I go eleven years without watching this? I should hang my head in shame. I love portmanteau movies and stuff that gets really weird, so I have no real reason why I skipped this. Here's hoping everyone can find it in their heart to forgive me.Inspired by Season's Greetings, an animated short created by Trick 'r Treat writer and director Michael Dougherty, this film tells the story of the night of Halloween in Warren Valley, Ohio. It's nonlinear the way it all plays out (think Pulp Fiction) and several of the stories cross over. They all have one thing in common - Sam, a little trick or treater dressed in pajamas and a burlap sack for a mask. If anyone goes against the rules of the holiday, he's there to ensure they pay for it.I love the look of Sam. For the first part of the movie, I was sure he was just a little trick or treater who was left behind by his friends and was witnessing everything going on. Once you realize what he's doing, you start rooting for the little guy.From a couple who take down their decorations too soon to an obese boy who can't stop smashing pumpkins, everyone gets their reward. There's also the school principal and potential serial killer Steven Wilkins, the elderly recluse Mr. Kreeg (the always great Brian Cox), a gang of kids trying to frighten Rhonda with the Halloween School Bus Massacre urban legend and a group of four girls out to party (including Anna Paquin as a shy virgin). Each of their tales will all be intertwined, complete with murder, gore, werewolves, zombies and finally, Sam's secret face.This feels like the great lost 1980's horror movie and I loved every single minute of it. They've been teasing a sequel for a few years and now I can't wait for everyone to get their act together. Writer/director Michael Dougherty was also behind the film Krampus, which I could not enjoy no matter how hard I tried, and is the writer/director behind next year's Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Hopefully, his next project is the follow up for Sam!",Trick 'r Treat
10,Coventry,Delightful Season's Creepings!,8,1 November 2009,"After months and months of reading glorifying reviews and avoiding discussions in this website's forum section, my friends and I finally watched ""Trick 'R Treat"" on the night it was meant to be watched! Halloween's eve! They say this is the best holiday themed movie since John Carpenter's original ""Halloween"" of 1978, and you know what? They are more than right! ""Trick 'R Treat"" is a spirited and refreshing genre highlight that is ingeniously structured and chock-full of old-fashioned spooky & sinister horror themes. Writer/director Michael Dougherty is more than obviously a horror connoisseur, as he knows exactly which types of monsters and story lines should be included in an anthology revolving on the night of Halloween. The script is a splendid mixture of classic horror subjects (like werewolves, vampires and urban legends) and innovative ideas like a creepily recurring pumpkin-faced little monster. The events naturally take place on Halloween, in a quiet little town where absolutely nothing is kosher. Four beautiful girls arrive in their sexy costumes and get ready for a wild night of seasonal rituals. Elsewhere, a seemingly sophisticated family man enrolls his young son in a heinous Halloween tradition, while his estranged hermit neighbor becomes involved in a showdown with a mysterious Jack O' Lantern creature. The best little segment of the bunch introduces a handful of local children heading outside of town to the place where allegedly 30 years ago a dark and horrifying secret got buried. A bus full of mentally underdeveloped children crashed into a ravine, but it is said that it was a set-up and that the bribed bus driver mysteriously vanished afterwards. Perhaps ""Trick 'R Treat"" is not as petrifying as I've read in some reviews, but it does contain multiple atmospheric sequences and admirably built up suspense. The film also features a lot of comical undertones, however, and the mishmash narrative structure (kind of reminiscent to ""Pulp Fiction"") also makes it very light-hearted to endure. ""Trick 'R Treat"" isn't as gory as you might expect, but at least the script doesn't avoid any taboo subjects and you can't predict every twist from a mile in advance. The acting performances are terrific, with a few familiar and respectable names in the cast like Brian Cox, Dylan Baker and Anna Paquin. The score is awesome and creepy and personally I hope that Michael Dougherty tackles a lot more holidays into horror films.",Trick 'r Treat
11,michaelRokeefe,Halloween pleaser.,8,10 November 2009,"Thank you Michael Dougherty for writing and directing this treat that mixes a bit of suspense with gory goodness. A blend of several little Halloween stories that don't disappoint one bit. Anna Paquin plays a young college virgin that goes off to a party as Little Red Riding Hood looking for just the right guy. He finds her. Kind of comical and evil is Dylan Baker as a school principal with a serial killer attitude. I love the scene where he takes his obnoxious son into the basement. A couple returns home and the woman(Leslie Bibb) wants to blow out a jack-o'-lantern and take down the decorations in the front yard earlier than her husband would like. And a group of trick or treaters get more than they want when investigating an old Halloween tale of a school bus and rock quarry. Brian Cox is an old hermit that is visited by a very malice trick-or-treater with a few bones to pick.Some very nice graphics and situations. You don't have to watch too close to see how the stories are interwoven. Not overly slice and dice, but just enough believable fright to share. Also in the cast: Samm Todd, Alberto Ghisi, Lauren Lee Smith and Rochelle Aytes.",Trick 'r Treat
12,hitchcockthelegend,"No tricks here, just a treat.",8,1 November 2012,"Trick 'r Treat is written and directed by Michael Dougherty. It stars Dylan Baker, Rochelle Aytes, Anna Paquin and Brian Cox. Music is by Douglas Pipes and cinematography by Glen MacPherson. Trick 'r Treat plays out as an anthology of four Halloween related stories. One tiny figure with a burlap sack over its head links the film together.Warner Brothers kept it on the shelf for two years, a mistake since it happens to be a delightful little frightener that appears to be made with a love of omnibus shockers from back in the day. It's never overtly scary or bloody, but it has a twisted slickness that is rather pleasing in this day and age of poor horror remakes and boorish cash cow sequels. Neatly performed by the cast and with tech credits high from the camera folk, it homages simple horror pleasures as it celebrates Halloween. With a glint in its eye and a macabre smile on the lips, this non linear treat should be perennial viewing for the Halloween hordes. Especially since it rewards still further on repeat viewings. 8/10",Trick 'r Treat
13,Hey_Sweden,Happy Halloween.,8,5 October 2012,"Woe to those that don't keep the spirit of Halloween close to their hearts. That's the lesson learned in this horror omnibus from director Michael Dougherty, who'd written such things as ""X2"", ""Urban Legends: Bloody Mary"", and ""Superman Returns"". He weaves together separate stories that take place on Halloween night, and for Mr. Dougherty and company, it's all about having fun, and delighting in all of the trappings of this time of year. Aided and abetted by a great cast and crew, he's crafted something here that deserves to take its place among other cinematic standards of the season, especially when it comes to his potentially iconic, cute / creepy character, Sam. He doesn't keep this going on any longer than it really should (note the short running time of 83 minutes), and packs his 2.35:1 picture with as many visual delights as possible.One of the best elements to its storytelling is the way that it works backward, and shows everything that brought the story to the point at which the film begins. All of this helps to support the old tag line from ""Creepshow"": ""The most fun you'll ever have being scared."" And this movie does borrow from that early 80s classic in not just its format, but its visuals, enhancing a few key scenes with comic book style art. There's also a brilliant little tribute to John Carpenters' ""The Thing"" at one point. The colourful cinematography is by Glen MacPherson, the production design by Mark Freeborn, and the ominous music by Douglas Pipes. The various stories unfold as follows:1) A grumpy married woman, Emma (Leslie Bibb), who doesn't like Halloween, and has a hard time tolerating her husbands' enjoyment of it.2) A school principal, Steven (Dylan Baker), who moonlights as a serial killer, and has a tough time disposing of his bodies, while trying to placate his young son. People will roar with laughter when they hear the memorable refrain referring to classic comic strip character Charlie Brown.3) A nasty prank pulled on one kid by some of her peers, which ultimately backfires.4) A virginal young woman, Laurie (Anna Paquin), on her way to a party, dressed as Little Red Riding Hood. It is quite deliciously revealed that she has a heavily ironic secret.and 5) Another grump, old miser Mr. Kreeg (reliable veteran Brian Cox) who gets his comeuppance and learns to appreciate the holiday.Fans of this genre should find this terrifically macabre and just bursting with Halloween spirit. It's got its fair share of general creepiness and irresistible dark humour.Highly recommended.Eight out of 10.",Trick 'r Treat

There are also other threads running through this very busy horror film.I'm going to be honest and say that I don't know what I think of this film. Its certainly good, but I went to it hearing about how great and wonderful it was that seeing it I was rather disappointed. To me there are a some chills but no real scares. I think the fragmented nature, the film bounces backward and forward through the night , hurts the film in that no story builds up momentum enough to be truly scary. Don't get me wrong the film is full of neat ideas, good looking monsters, great performances and some nice ""EC Comics"" style twists, but it just didn't scare me.

17,utgard14,Pretty Good,6,23 May 2015,"I love horror anthologies. I'm particularly fond of the older ones. A lot of the more recent ones have left a bad taste in my mouth. This is probably the best I've seen from the last few decades. Without giving away too much, the movie follows various people on Halloween night in a small town. Their stories intersect in one way or another and many of them meet a grisly end. The one character linking them all is a little boy dressed in a costume with a pumpkin head. None of the stories are that exceptional but they're all entertaining to some extent. Dylan Baker delivers the movie's best performance but nobody embarrasses themselves. Although I thought Baker was great, his story wasn't my favorite. My favorite would be the story with the kids and the quarry. The segment with Anna Paquin and her friends was probably the most predictable and, due to its somewhat cheesy twist, the most like the stories of the old Amicus movies. Still, I enjoyed it. The movie has its share of lovely ladies, which is always a plus. It's not for kids but it's also not especially gory or vile enough for many horror fans. If you like the old horror anthologies or if you like the Scream-style horror with heaping doses of ""hip"" dark humor, then you should like this. If you are that breed of horror fan that only enjoys the disgusting, perverse, and sadistic, then you will probably be very disappointed with this.

20,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Absolutely spectacular Halloween anthology,10,1 October 2015,"On Halloween night, a diminutive demon goes through a small town watching the townspeople observing the rules and traditions of the night.The Good Stor(ies): Story 1-Preparing for a Halloween party, a group of friends start chastising their virginal friend for not following through on her sisters' rules for their group. Determined to end their teasing, she sets out on the town to find a date for the part in the woods nearby, and after bringing him out, reveals a dark secret about the group's true nature. This was quite an enjoyable segment which offers a lot about it, the biggest of which is the twist involving the main group of girls. Not only is this highly surprising but comes off nicely with the hidden symbolism throughout here with their costumes setting up the twist nicely, and the revelation sequence at the forest-bound party offers some solid gore in the brutal kills, outstanding creature make-up and a novel way of playing up the creature-twist scene here which gives this a great finale. Even the early scenes of the masked man playing with the parade-goers back in town is a fun series of scenes showing him attacking and leaving his victims around town to be found there in the other stories works nicely. The only thing hurting this one is the non- linear set-up of the story, with everything spelled out in two or three check-ins rather than one straight-forward run. Beyond this, there's not much else wrong here.Story 2-Going around town trick-or-treating, a group of kids collect pumpkins for a scavenger hunt in order to test a local legend about a haunted quarry in town. Accomplishing their task and heading out to the quarry, they find the local legend is far more real and dangerous than they expected. This was another overall fantastic story which is hurt only by what is common to all the segments in the cutting away to wrap all the other segments up rather than the straight-on run that most anthologies offer. Still, this one brings a lot of enjoyable elements mostly brought up by this delivering an absolutely impressive atmosphere along the way. Using their trick-or-treating ploy throughout the first half, it allows for numerous scenes of the kids in costumes running past house absolutely festooned with jack-o-lanterns, white-sheet ghosts, lighted pumpkins and general Halloween decorations which is really good at delivering an effective atmosphere here. the second half, which is set-up nicely at the beginning with the story of the kids and the school-bus at the quarry to turn this into an effective ghost story full of the typical revenge prototypes and urban legend folklore which is a lot of fun. That also sets up the finale in the fog-enshrouded pit which features a real sense of isolation in the scenes, a rather brutal sense about it and load s of suspense which is really nice.Story 3-Trying to enjoy Halloween, a lonely miser ends up insulting a trick-or-treater by refusing to partake in the usual traditions of the holiday. Soon finding himself under attack, the battle throughout his house proves more daunting than anything he ever expected. This was a wholly fantastic entry that doesn't get a lot wrong. Keeping this confined to his house which makes this one come off like a traditional slasher is a lot of fun, which brings about a strong series of confrontations and action throughout here as the scenes in his bedroom or the big brawl in the living room around all the different ornaments are all exciting and fun. As well, there's the full revelation of what the bag-headed child really looks like which is a great shock scene, and really manages to tie all the different segments together by interacting with characters from all of them in some nice scenes overall. Lastly, this one works by being played straight-on, rather than cutting around to the others and shows how good that tactics works. On the whole, these make it the best of the segments.The Bad Stor(ies)-Wraparound-Really, the wraparound here is about the only thing truly wrong with this as these two quick, brief inserts aren't all that impressive as they are and would've fared much better had they been established as more traditional stories. The wife fed up with the decorations of the holiday and wanting to be rid of them much too early could've been a lot more fun rather than being set-up only for the lone shock jump it plays off as, and the secondary interlude about the exasperated father with his energetic son could've made for a fun time here with some fantastic scenes of them trying to keep everyone together and the two lives separated from each other, but instead it's another one-note joke set-up and doesn't really do a whole lot as it is. These really could've been extended into longer segments and been a part of the story that way.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and children- in-jeopardy.",Trick 'r Treat
21,FlashCallahan,A brilliant anthology....,9,4 November 2013,"The rituals of Halloween were devised to protect us from evil, and one small town is about to be taught a lesson that some traditions are best not forgotten.A suburban couple learn the dangers of blowing out a Jack-o-Lantern before midnight.Four women cross paths with a costumed stalker at a local festival, a group of pranksters goes too far and discovers the horrifying truth buried in a local legend, And finally, a cantankerous old hermit is visited by a strange trick-or-treater with a few bones to pick.....It's a strange but brilliant anthology, this way underrated, and overlooked little gem.Imagine Joe Dante crossed with Leigh Whannel, and you have this movie which is more treat than trick.Usually with anthology movies, you have one slightly dud story, but here, they are all interwoven seamlessly, and the wealth of talent here only adds to the joy.While not necessarily scary, it's referential to the whole horror genre, but you wouldn't know this, because the references are so intricate, they are pretty hard to spot.The whole movie has a sort of childlike feel to it, almost like The Twilight Zone movie from 1983, this makes the flashes of gore more stark and noteworthy.All in all, it's a great movie to watch at this time of the year, as much as Home Alone is to watch at Christmas.",Trick 'r Treat
22,Aaron1375,For the most part this movie is a treat to watch.,8,9 October 2009,"I can not believe this movie never really got a wide release, it is a very well done movie and puts a lot of recent horror movies to shame. What made it so bad that they decided not to really give it a big release? It has stars in it, granted no one super big, but I recognized a few of them, it had a rather good story going, and it looked very nice too. The story consists of four separated stories that are interwoven as the characters at times cross each others paths and at other times take a bigger part in each others tales. Starts out in Creepshow fashion as the titles go through a comic type scene, however that is not really used in the rest of the film much at all. The stories are one that involves a very strange trick or treater that seems to get upset if you blow out your jack o'lantern or you do not give out candy, a school principal that has a very dark side to him, a bunch of kids going around the neighborhood looking for jack o'lanterns for a creepy game they wish to play, and a group of attractive girls trying to find some guys to go to a special get together. The stories connect nicely and this movie is good for the most part, one of the main problems is the film is very short and more development could have been used in areas of this film. I would like to know more about the special trick or treater, more about the principal and I would have preferred for the deaths at the one place to be on screen. Also, a question arose after watching the film of what was the significance of the bus driver going down too? Seems even if they made it where the plan worked the ending still would have been about the same. Still, this movie was entertaining, it is nice to have a Halloween movie look and feel like Halloween night and for a change not involve a dude in a bleached out William Shattner mask. No offense mind you as I like those movies too.",Trick 'r Treat

It isn't a slasher like so many thought due the title and it isn't rather for kids too due the sometimes nasty scene's. There is also some kind of black humor in it. So you see, what was it that I saw. It's a kind of story were everybody is involved with within his own story. When the movie stops that is exactly were the movie started, in between you will see vampires, werewolves and some kind of child molester. But the main lead is a living pumpkin-head. It's that kind of movie were you better start the evening with. You will enjoy it but at the end you surely will ask yourself what have I just seen. The acting was okay and the red stuff do flows frequently but it's just the compilation as said of vampires, werewolves, zombies and ghouls that makes it something that stand on his own.

24,siderite,"Pretty gutsy movie, and fun, but not too scary",9,1 November 2009,"I rate it high because what it tried to be: a true Halloween holiday movie. Just like Christmas has all possible versions of movies made for it, Halloween just had to have one and this is it. So, for what it is worth, I grade high an original and fun movie that is clearly different from what I had expected.This being said, it is not a single story, but four, all interwoven with minimal contact points. The plots themselves are fun, but not terribly scary; instead, it is the atmosphere that this is all about. However, I couldn't shake the Stories from the Crypt/Twilight Zone feel, and in the end I can imagine this film as one extended episode of any of the fore-mentioned shows. Once it hit me that this is how it is going to be, I started predicting outcomes and stopped being surprised.Bottom line: Halloween is exposed as any other great holiday, a pretext for people to fornicate, play the fool, hunt their victims or be unhappy, hiding their secrets. The spirit of All Hallow's Eve has something else in mind, though, and that kind of lifts the movie out from the boring.I really liked the H-monster, if I can call it thus, both deadly and innocent, child like, but completely alien; something after my own heart.",Trick 'r Treat

If you don't, I don't care, I'll just get Sam Pumpkinhead and your flesh he'll tear!",9,22 April 2012,"John Carpenter made the famous movie Halloween back in the 1970's, it was a clever thriller that gave birth to a new genre. He made a sequel still starring the killer and then made another Halloween with a different plot and planned to make an anthology but the audiences didn't respond to it. However, it's a great idea and one that got tossed too soon because if you think about it, it was very clever. Every year for Halloween to watch a different scary story. We did get Creepshow and Tales from the Crypt but what do we have in today's generation? We got a clever anthology called Trick 'r Treat. Halloween is all about the excitement of dressing up, getting candy, decorating and telling scary stories. It brings you back to being a kid and just enjoying the day of scares. Trick 'r Treat takes you back in the circle of friends you had telling a scary story before bed time and giving you nightmares for a week.The film is an anthology of four Halloween-related scary stories. Emma and her holiday-obsessed husband, Henry have set up numerous ghost-scarecrows for Halloween in their yard. While Henry is inside waiting for Emma to take down the decorations, she is murdered with a large blade-shaped pumpkin lollipop by an unknown assailant. Steven Wilkins, the middle-aged town principal, spots Charlie stealing candy from his yard. Smiling, he places him on his front door and talks to him, carving out a jock-o-lantern, and he gives him a candy, in which he placed a poison. Five kids journey to the local rock quarry where they are told that the local urban legend of ""The Halloween School Bus Massacre"". Laurie, a self-conscious 22-year-old virgin, is at the local theme park party with her friends. She is annoyed by their talks about the boys, and goes out on the several drives on the theme park. The other girls find local men at the party, and they pick the girls up, leaving Laurie behind at the park. Angry and alone, she decides to go to the woods. There, she is attacked by a vampire. At the local camp nearby, her sister Danielle and her friends Maria and Janet party at a bonfire with men they picked up along the way. The vampire's body suddenly drops from a tree onto the party and Laurie appears. The ""vampire"" is revealed to be Principal Wilkins in disguise wearing fake fangs. The girls at the party, along with Laurie, suddenly transform into bloody werewolves, removing their skins, and is revealed that Laurie's ""virginity"" is actually that she has never killed anyone as a werewolf, and they devour their dates along with Wilkins.The stories were really creative. I think my favorite was the female werewolf pack, it was a great twist on what could have been a cliché story. I liked the bus going over the cliff story, it reminded me of being a kid and my friends and I going somewhere making up a silly story about how it was haunted in some way. The make up effects were fantastic and the sets were chilling. I loved Sam the Pumpkinhead, what a great new Halloween figure! He was the scariest part of the movie and was very creative in how he tortured his victims. The only flaws I'd find in the film is that some stories did drag a little bit, it's a short movie, but they should keep the tension in mind. During the bus story where the kids are walking around the beach did get a little long at times. But it's a minor complaint that I'm sure anyone could get past. I think I have a new movie to add in Halloween traditional films to watch selection. This is a good one I'd recommend to horror fans, it was a ton of fun to watch.9/10",Trick 'r Treat

It maybe OK to watch if there is nothing else on the TV (with nothing else to do).This movie is a little gory but not completely that way. There are 4 intertwined stories to watch in one movie - which, for me, were not all that great.

27,thesar-2,Tricked Back into this Treat,9,3 October 2009,"(Originally, I watched this one other time: October 6, 2009. This review is a recap, and second viewing on October 1, 2013. Cheers)Wow. What a mistake I made when I originally saw this. Initially, I gave this 3½ out of 5 stars. Upon watching this BluRay purchase, just barely less than 4 years time (5 days shy of 4 years) and only my second viewing, I am thoroughlyglad I bought this on BluRay. My rating quickly increased to 4½/5 Stars with this screening.This movie was fantastic, elegantly and originally written and played a nice curve ball to the standard horror anthology films. It also had great acting, hilarious lines and though a big chunk of the movie relied on humor, it didn't forget – ever – it was a horror movie. In fact, the ""final"" segment, the fight between Sam and Mr. Kreeg was so eerie, so terrifying, I know I'd have nightmares for years to come had I seen that as a child. It would have stuck with me like another horror anthology's Zuni Doll segment did from Trilogy of Terror that I had seen as a kid. That short story has never left my memory, or the fright I first experienced. Love it. As would I have, with this attack on Mr. Kreeg.But, that's not saying the rest of the movie either didn't have horror or memorable scenes. They all did. And the way it was so well craftedagain, I am shocked I was so hard on it in the first place, four years ago. Can't make that mistake again. This movie won't be watched now, once every four years. I own it on BluRay and it'll be an October staple for me.* * *Final thoughts: Here were my original thoughts on October 6, 2009:(Original Headline, or ""Summary""): What a Treat it is to Trick the audience once moreHighly effective in spots, 'Trick 'R' Treat' is highly recommended for those who want to reminisce of the 1980-90s horror films, especially 'Creepshow.' Now, this one does take it a step further by continuously overlapping and backtracking on four stories of horror. Now, it wasn't perfect, as I felt no story really was complete, and when you begin to get involved into a story it bounces around before you can get fully vested. In addition, they keep trying to shock you with twists and turns – I admit, I was dumbfounded when you learn who the Brian Cox character really is, boy, I'm ashamed I should've seen that coming. And finally, I've read some information why this was shelved (Sorry, 'Superman Returns' was not a disappointment - $391m worldwide? That's another story) and I can't see why. This was a great homage to those older horror stories/movies. Creepy, scary, original and funny in spots. I see where they're trying a little too hard in irony, but a lot worked. The acting was completely believable, the pace was adequate and the gore was there for those seeking it. The movie's synopsis states there were four interweaving ""horror/campfire"" stories one Halloween night. I didn't really count, but it felt like a lot more, some more predictable than others. The already stated Brian Cox one I was thrown (and I'm still embarrassed) yet the School Bus massacre was seen a mile away. As for the Principal story, I couldn't believe how far they took it, or did they? That was another aspect I liked: every time they threw in comedy, they reminded you this isn't a 'Goosebumps' video. Just like when you side with 'Hannibal Lector' they remind you he's really a monster. I'd highly recommend this for die-hard 1980-90s horror and 'Sookie/Vampire' fans.",Trick 'r Treat

Always inspect your candy 2. Do not snuff out a jack-o'-lantern on Halloween 3. Wear a costume 4. Hand out candyWhen those rules are broken by an ensemble cast (Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Dylan Baker, Leslie Bibb) in a series of vignettes, Sam stands idly by as frightful consequences ensue.From a homicidal principal to a werewolf's deflowering to the living corpses of costumed mentally challenged children, Trick 'r Treat masterfully ties all the terrifying tales together nicely.However, there really should be a 5th Halloween rule: no penis costumes.

33,sol-,A Halloween to Remember,7,4 July 2017,"Several residents of a small Canadian town find themselves terrified on Halloween Eve for various reasons in this effective horror-thriller from producer Bryan Singer. 'Trick 'r Treat' is often cited as a horror anthology, however, unlike the average anthology, the tales do not play out sequentially. Rather, they overlap and intertwine with the film going back in time at key points to show that the events all occur at much the same time. While 'Trick 'r Treat' gets most of its zest from this rather novel approach to presenting an anthology, with some excellent moments as common characters appear and re-appear, the film is mostly propelled by a zany black comedy streak. Humorous incidents include a failed attempt to bury a body, a rapist getting more than he bargained for and one man's ignorance towards his wife being attacked. The interlocking tales admittedly vary in effectiveness with some pretty obvious twists and questionable performances, but generally speaking, it is an intense and intriguing ride as one waits to see how the tales will overlap. There are some pretty neat special effects in the mix too, which are kept at a minimum with Singer clearly understanding the greater terror power of the implied. Dylan Baker and Brian Cox additionally offer some classy turns as two obnoxious neighbours who take their dislike of Halloween to different extremes.",Trick 'r Treat
34,zkonedog,Do You Like Your Stories With No Narratives?,1,1 March 2017,"Movies like this are not ones that I usually go for. Horror flicks are a dime a dozen these days, and it's tough to weed the good ones out of the murky mess, a task not usually worthy of my time. This year, though, I kept seeing ""Trick 'r Treat"" pop up on ""must watch"" list for scary Halloween flicks. It finally sucked me in because I was intrigued by the promise of some overlapping narratives. It seemed like an interesting way to tell some scary stories.What I found, however, was that ""Trick 'r Treat"" is a lame excuse of a ""horror flick"", offering nothing new to the genre and completely underwhelming in what it did bring to the table. Besides a couple of ""jump scares"", it almost put me to sleep.The promise of overlapping narratives? Technically, it did do such a thing, but in no meaningful way. I kept hoping for the narratives to all come together in the end, but nothing of the sort happens. It just kind of descends into a mess, with even the one ""big reveal"" coming so late and anticlimactically as to be almost laughable.Anything resemble real suspense? Nope...not here. Besides maybe two scares that will get you to jump, everything else is rather predictable or old hat.The promise of some fun moments? It looks like that might happen in the first few minutes, but even that quickly dies. A couple looks to have fun, a group of hot chicks go out on the town...and then everything fizzles. Basically, this movie can't even decide on a mood from one scene to the next.I'm glad this movie was only 82 minutes, as I likely would not have been able to stomach much more of its brand of ""horror"". I knew about 20 minutes in that it was taking a turn for the worse, and it only kept down that road...never recovering. Why this keeps showing up as a Halloween classic? I haven't the foggiest. Maybe because it is one of the few horror films actually set on Halloween night? That's all I can think of. The film itself offers practically no merits beside that setting.",Trick 'r Treat

But it DOES live up to its promise: it harks back to the fright films of the late 70s and early 80s and evokes that all-important SPIRIT of Halloween. Halloween is and always HAS been my favorite holiday, and TRICK OR TREAT is the ideal holiday fare. Be advised: it's not one of those sanitized, ""family-friendly"" movies you find all too often on television; it has an edge (or two), including some (thankfully) gratuitous nudity. Brian Cox delivers the best of the Goods, but the relatively young cast is impressive, as well.

40,Foreverisacastironmess123,~Sam was here!~,8,9 May 2015,"I grew up loving shows and movies like Creepshow, Are You Afraid of the Dark, the 90s Outer Limits, the original Twilight Zone and of course the almighty Tales From the Crypt, and I think in its own way this movie lives up to the fun grim spirit of all that. Seeing it for the first time last October made me appreciate the traditions of the season a little more, and it gave me a little hope that the art of the movie horror anthology wasn't a completely dead one. It was one of the best I'd seen in years, I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The style and angle of the stories was very interesting, it was a different format for this kind of thing, I of course speak of how this is an anthology that ingeniously links its different stories together in small but fascinating ways, even as one tale ends another begins, one road leads to another, and there are many-a sign of doom up ahead... It works so fantastically as a Halloween movie. It's saturated in it, practically the entire colour scheme is orange and I don't think there's a single scene that doesn't feature a pumpkin or a candle or something Gothic. It has an effortlessly festive feel, and you can't help being took back a little to when you may have dressed up for Halloween as a kid. There's great attention to detail, and you can tell it was put together with extreme care by people that not only love Halloween, but horror in general. Each story is well-paced and doesn't overstay its welcome, and they flow so seamlessly that it feels more like one big movie rather than four separate stories, five if you include the wraparound where the bitch is made into a human pumpkin effigy! It's dark, but they never go overboard with the violence and they keep a handle on the overall fun of everything. I enjoy the first story because of the black humour with the stomach-churning gore effect of the fat kid puking up a storm and then later when the cranky old man is trying to figure out what's going on in the killer principal's back yard as he's trying to keep the poor kid quiet, as well as his own son who may not be as sweet and innocent as he seems.. Didn't see that one coming, and it's still daring even today to kill a kid, so y'know, a thumbs-up to that! Second story's okay, I liked how the kids got to use a few choice swears, as despite what most adults like to think, you put any group of kids together without any grownups around and they are want to swear like little sailors! The cinematography of the tragic legend of the school-bus is beautifully lighted, it made me sad how one of the kids seemed to be autistic, rather than mentally slow.. Their costumes were so cool and creepy, especially the one dressed as Satan. Something that bugs me a tad is how when the zombified children appear, while they are scary and messed-up looking, the scene is so dark that you can barely make them out.. Those kids fatally underestimated the trauma of the shy girl who they chose to play their mean prank on. But still in my opinion shell-shocked or not, it was mighty cold of her to leave them to die like that. The third chapter is set up at the beginning of the movie and pays off later. It's really funny when you're watching it again and you're getting the real meaning behind their girly banter! Didn't see that twist coming either, I really thought the clan of sexy ladies were vampires.. I loved how they transformed into werewolves by turning inside out and stripping out of their skins, it's quite hot and gross at the same time, can't say I'd seen it done that way before! Very nice to see some great practical effect work being done. So they weren't horny, they were hungry! The last story is my favourite, I love all the action suspense and humour of it, it felt like a great Crypt episode. I loved it because it uses the star, an impish spirit pretending to be a child on Halloween Night. Despite never saying a word he's such an awesome character, as well as being so small that he could easily be considered adorable! He's always silently watching over the events and sometimes guiding the guilty souls to their demise in little ways. This mysterious tiny trickster *is* Halloween. And it's a great reveal when you get to see what he really looks like under the potato sack, and it ain't pretty! He's a living pumpkin, which is kind of ironic, as pumpkins are meant to scare evil spirits away! The story is just him terrorising old man Cox, a man who doesn't just live like a hermit and hates Halloween because he's an old jerk, but because it was on a Halloween many years previously that he committed a very bad deed for which he was never brought to justice... The whole ordeal is simply for the piece of candy that Sam feels he's entitled to, and then he glares at the old man and leaves him alone, probably because he knows that someone else is coming to deliver his just desserts that night... Just kick back, don't take it too seriously, and just enjoy the spooky ride for what it is, because as far as sheer fun-factor goes, it really delivers.

In the same night of a small town (Stories are told out of order in ""Pulp Fiction"" style). Stories are about an seemingly nice man (Dylan Baker), who's actually a Serial Killer and also The Principal of a local High School. Five Teenagers (Samm Todd, Britt McKillip, Jean-Luc Bilodeau, Alberto Ghisi & Isabelle Deluce) goes to their local rock quarry to talk about a creepy story of ""The School Bus Massacre"", a local legend tale. A shy 22 year old ""Virgin"" (Oscar-Winner:Anna Paquin) looks for a date for a surprise party somewhere in the woods along her older sister (Laurie Lee Smith) and her two friends (Rochelle Aytes & Moneca Delain). A mean-spirited old man (Brian Cox), who genuinely hates Halloween. Who lives alone in a house with his dog. Who finds himself stalked by a mysterious small boy (Quinn Lord), who's dressed in a shabby orange pajamas costume with a burlap sack over his head.Written and Directed by Michael Dougherty (Screenwriter of ""X-Men 2"" and ""Superman Returns"") made an genuinely amusing dark humoured Anthology horror film in the style of ""Creepshow"", ""Tales from the Darkside"" and ""Tales from the Crypt"". The movie has an amusing Prologue and an satisfying Epilogue as well. This picture was originally shot in the fall of 2006 and finish in early 2007. It was supposed to be released in October of 2007. But for some reason, the studio Warner Bros decided not to release the movie. The film does have some controversial scenes early on the movie, especially with the first segment but it's done with black comedy and shouldn't been taking seriously. Surprisingly there's much more violent horror pictures out there like ""Saw"" movies for example. It's too bad that Warner Bros didn't have the guts to release this extremely well made movie. This could have been their new ""Creepshow"". Since they also released ""Creepshow"" for a theatrical release back in 1982.The Blu-ray version has an sharp High Definition anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 True HD sound. The Blu-ray also includes an running commentary track by the filmmakers, an behind the scenes featurette, deleted scenes with optional commentary and more. Special Edition Blu-ray also included an Digital Copy as well. I remember back in 2007, i seen the trailers and even posters of this movie. I couldn't wait to see it. Warner Bros certainly made us wait for this film. It was a good thing, it was release for film festivals with positive reviews before the studio decided to release finally. I guess, they didn't know what they had. Shame on the studio, who should have known better.Overall ""Trick r' Treat"" is a very good movie for a first time director. I felt that the film, it was a bit too short for my taste. But seeing the deleted scenes on the disc, he was certainly wise to deleted them for the picture. It is possible the director Dougherty might direct a possible sequel to this movie. If he does, i hope he makes it with the same feeling of amusement and joy of the first one. If you haven't seen it, you are certainly missing a special treat. Do not miss this movie. Great music score by Douglas Pipes (Monster House). Terrific Cinematography by Glen MacPherson (Rambo, 16 Blocks). Produced by Bryan Singer (Apt Pupil, The Usual Suspects, Valkyrie). Super 35. (****/*****).",Trick 'r Treat

It's an anthology, but the stories tie together. It feels like one complete piece. Not only one of my favorite scary movies, but THE movie to watch in October. Hopefully one day we'll get a sequel, because then we'd find out how popular the series is, and of course it would be great to see Sam cement his status as the icon of the season.",Trick 'r Treat
43,TdSmth5,Should have been better,6,9 December 2013,"In the intro we meet a couple during Halloween. It's before midnight and she's ready to call it a night. She doesn't care about Halloween tradition, he does. As she takes down their Halloween setup, she's brutally killed by something.Next we meet 4 girls buying their Halloween costumes. We are told that this is taking place ""earlier"" than the intro. One of the girl is innocent and inexperienced with men and the others try advise her. Her sister repeats the usual ""be yourself"". The three leave in a van with some TV crew, the innocent girl wants to meet someone on her own. While they're walking, they bump into the couple form the intro. And that's more or less how all the stories here connect, just cursorily.Next, a fat boy is destroying jack-o-lanterns in the neighborhood and goes to the house of the local school's principal who gives him candy. The boy suddenly projectile vomits and apparently dies. The guy takes him into the house, tries to bury him and has some sinister plans for the body with his young son. At some point a group of kids arrives to trick or treat and a grumpy neighbor complains about the noise.Now we meet the trick or treating group of kids. They pick up the unpopular girl and her cart full of lanterns. They go to some rock mine and the popular girl tells a story of the town's dark past, when they tried to eliminate a bus full of their unwanted and disabled children. According to the story the entire bus falls down a ravine, bus driver and all. But they kids also aim to terrorize the unpopular girl. But she isn't as dumb as they think she is.At some point we meet a guy dressed up as an executioner who seduces and then bites a girl's neck. Later he meets our innocent girl from before. Just as he's about to bite her, we cut to the other girls who are at some party. A body falls from somewhere. It's the executioner/vampire guy who's also someone we've met before. This will be the innocent's girl initiation. But you won't believe what the initiation is all about.Finally we return to the grumpy guy who has a creepy kid in a creepy costume visit him. We've seen the kid before repeatedly. He's at the bloody conclusion of each of the stories, just standing there and watching. But he's not just any kid. We learn more about the old man's past and how it comes back to haunt him.Trick 'r Treat is an unusual horror movie. It's unusual how the story is told. Interconnected stories are not uncommon but it is when the connection is so superficial. And as a result you don't have anyone to connect to, no main character. Each story, too, doesn't feature anyone to care for. The stories themselves aren't all that great. The story with the girls is the most surprising and neat. For a horror movie with a Halloween theme, Trick 'r Treat sure is mild. There's just a tad bit of violence and gore, and two seconds of nudity at most. This movie has some ideas, some decent acting, but somehow it doesn't work out all that well in the end. This is the kind of movie done in the right spirit that you want to like, but can't.",Trick 'r Treat
44,aidanratesmovies,"Surprisingly, I Loved it",10,23 September 2020,"Surprisingly fun, and rather clever- Trick 'r Treat makes the best of its spread out horror premise, due to its stellar work behind the screen by Michael Dougherty, and its sheer sense of energy to have a good time. I have to admit, going into the film, I wasn't expecting much. I had seen previous works like this, namely Creepshow (1982), and I wasn't all that impressed by what I had seen. To be far, it does take inspiration in Creepshow, and like it, Trick 'r Treat does have a handful of campy moments, but just something works about this film that so few other films would be able to achieve. It doesn't feel dull to watch, or overly gorey, or simply dark for the sake of being so- it feels well crafted, atmospheric, and somewhat nostalgic- finding a way to balance its own campiness with a sheer pride in how enjoyable its material truly can be. The weakest part of this film is the very beginning, which can feel rather abrupt and predictable, but by the end, when the events unfold full circle, you can't help but admire the fact that Dougherty chose to do the film this way. Michael Dougherty has made several notable works in the past, but there is no doubt that when it comes to film, he is truly what made this film special. His sensational fresh and entertaining take on so many familiar stories can't help but be a blast to enjoy, and although it's not perfect, you will certainly never be bored. I enjoyed the characters in this film. Although none were particularly deep or even greatly developed due to the films nature- you can't help but find an enjoyable narrative and reason to follow behind each one of them. Each offers a different take on such a recognized role, and in a way, you could consider this film largely unoriginal for focusing on this fact, but I find it is what makes the film so special. So many films fill the screen with cliches and acts you have seen all before, but none quite deliver what Trick 'r Treat has to offer, which is exactly what makes it so brilliant.

46,a_chinn,The ultimate Halloween movie is Norman Rockwell Americana by way of Stephen King,9,29 October 2018,"Back when I first watched this film, it really surprised me how good it was for a direct-to-video horror film, and over the years it's grown into probably my favorite Halloween movie. ""Trick 'R Treat"" is a darkly comic horror anthology film, telling four intertwined stories that all take place one Halloween night. A spooky diminutive child-sized character named Sam (you know, like Samhain, the pagan festival of the dead), with a gunnysack mask with button eyes makes an appearance in all four stories. One story involves a homicidal principal (character actor Dylan Baker), another involves a cruel Halloween prank gone wrong, the next involves virginal Anna Paquin being set up by her more experienced gal pals, and the last story stars Sam, where he teaches a mean old man (Brian Cox) a lesson about the true meaning of Halloween. The spirit of Halloween and sticking to the rules of Halloween is what motives Sam and links the four stories. Mixing comedy and horror is a tough nut to crack, but writer/director Michael Dougherty (""X-Men 2"" ""Superman Returns"" ""Krampus"") and produced by Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects"" ""Valkyrie"" ""Bohemian Rhapsody"") absolutely nail it. ""Trick 'R Treat"" manages to be scary, funny, and always entertaining. The film carries a light tone, but the level of violence is definitely not for the kids. The film is something of a Halloweenophile's dream, depicting a small-town that appears to put on the most elaborate town square Halloween party you've ever seen, is filled with the most amazing front yard displays you've ever laid eyes on, and depicts a town populated by more people super into Halloween than you ever thought existed. It's timeless Norman Rockwell Americana by way of Stephen King (how can you resist that!). Since its initial inauspicious debut direct-to-video, ""Trick 'R Treat"" has developed a sizable and well deserved cult following, so, if you're looking for one film to get you in the mood for Halloween, you should check this one out.",Trick 'r Treat

While hubby is upstairs watching a ""nature film"", his wife Emma (Leslie Bibb - Iron Man, Iron Man 2) is getting trussed like a Halloween ghost.Dylan Baker (Spider Man 2 & 3, and many other shows) was great as the principal with a secret life. He really did it to Brett Kelly (Bad Santa).And, yes, there are werewolves, and zombies, too.Child star Britt McKillip, and first timer Samm Todd were also very good.The biggest surprise was Anna Paquin and her friends (Moneca Delain, Rochelle Aytes & more).

48,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It'll entertain but not as strongly as some say it does,5,16 October 2015,"The holiday of Halloween, ""All Hallows' Eve"", ""All Soul's Night"" or whatever people prefer to call it is quite a lucrative holiday for all sorts of people. Retail stores and costume designers get a ton of money for selling their work to the international distributors. Plastic mold and makeup companies also receive lots of money because everybody loves to look wounded during Halloween for fun. These days however, not many of the newer generations were taught or understand of what Halloween was originally all about. For this comedy horror film, that's more or less the idea of what the movie tries to get across to its audience. To have knowledge of the old practices and comprehend what they mean, what's their purpose and whether or not you should follow them. The problem is, its execution needed to be better than what it is already set at. As writer for films like (X-Men 2 (2003)), Michael Dougherty disappoints as he debuts as director (and writer) to this compilation horror story.The plot is about five different interwoven stories that all occur on the same Halloween night, all of which have strange run-ins with other individuals. A school principle (Dylan Baker) has a desirable craze to harm ""trick or treaters"", a couple briefly argue over whether after partying they should immediately take down the decorations, another group of ""trick or treaters"" (Britt McKillip, Samm Todd and a few others) set out to prank one of their friends, another group of party girls (Rochelle Aytes, Lauren Lee Smith, Moneca Delainset and Anna Paquin) head out to find one of their friend's the perfect match and lastly, an old man (Brian Cox) faces off against a very aggressive ""trick or treater"". Unfortunately, Dougherty's writing isn't very strong when it comes to characters and it shows in his execution. For one, much of the main characters are thinly written with barely any development. Only a couple have a glimpse once or twice to display a background to a certain character's history. Other than that, it's all questions. Why does the principle enjoy killing so much? Who is this mystery ""trick or treater"" with the potato sack head? This does not mean the actors who star in this film don't perform well though. They just suffer from a lack of depth. However for the rest of the writing, Dougherty demonstrates that he's not fully incompetent. The film's strong aspect is its connectivity. Most times when a film tries to recap on certain events, it misses points and forgets to show how various stories intertwine. Not here though, there are several areas to notice when it comes to seeing this. Also credit must be given for having some unexpected twists and instilling the main moral behind each story. Halloween spirits fight fire with fire. If anything, it should make each viewer that much more respectful of the holiday.Again though audiences will run into problems for other parts aside from the writing. Sadly for effective as it is with setting up the rules and informing its viewers what's expected on the holiday, it really isn't scary. There are a couple of jump scares and they don't help but again there were creepy moments too. Those creepy moments were effective when they appeared. The scary component may not be as effective though because the film is part horror part comedy. Unsurprisingly, the comedy bits are only occasional too. There are some moments where the viewer may chuckle at how silly some characters act and the lines they say but it's not fully dark in its comedy either. The gore is thankfully a plus. There are a couple of nasty moments that can make the skin crawl. The idea of hiding razor blades in chocolate bars are just gag worthy. I would never want to realize that after I took a bite. Trick or treating can be a dangerous activity.The cinematography is also well crafted. Handled by Glen MacPherson (Walking Tall (2004)), the camera-work ably moves to hide whatever Dougherty does not want his audience to see until its needed. This mostly goes for the connectivity for each plot thread that intertwines with each other. And like any film that recaps its story, it is done in such a way one will not have to sit and watch the exact same scene exactly as they saw it before. Instead, the scenes are shot at different angles to get a different perspective. Then there's the film score composed by Douglas Pipes. Essentially, Pipes last name fits appropriately to the horror films he's worked on. Pipe organs are not always used in his music but they are still associated with creepy/horror films. Aside from not having a main theme however, Pipes does include unsettling singular tunes brought on music box. This particular motif represents the aggressive trick or treater. It also sounds very similar to that of his previous work from Monster House (2006), which was a good listening experience.It's too bad that a film like this that entirely focuses on Halloween's lore and traditions that it falls short of telling a compelling narrative. It has good camera-work, story thread connectivity, violence, and music but it focuses too much on details. Thus although the actors perform decently, their roles are not that interesting. It's not even that scary or funny for what it was originally trying to go for. It's a mixed bag of treats.",Trick 'r Treat
49,Matt_Layden,It Kept My Interest.,7,3 October 2009,"Trick R Treat tells multiple stories that all occur on the same night, Halloween. One involves a principal and the skeletons in his closet, a virgin who is about it experience her first time, a man who loves the holiday and his wife who hates it, an old cranky man in his house and finally a bunch of kids and a school bus. I'm trying to be a vague as possible because going into this film knowing very little is what will make you enjoy it more.I got a very ""Creepshow"" vibe from this one, the only difference is that the separate stories actually intertwine. Seeing bits in the beginning that you know will be explained at the end is always fun. It makes watching a film like this for a second time just as fun to try and spot more connections. The film has some comedic scenes, but don't be fooled. This film is not a comedy. The scenes a few and far between and mostly involve Brian Cox and Dylan Baker. Both of which are the highlights of the film.Baker is deliciously evil as the principal, who in my opinion is tarnished later on in the film by his reappearance in another 'story'. Cox is the grumpy old man who must battle the 'spirit of Halloween'. His story has the most creepy moments, but the film never really reaches any moments of true fright. It's just so random and unexpected that you don't really have any time to be scared. There are a few moments in the film that will have you scratching your head, but for the sake of the film, I just went with it. In the end, it all jives together.There is no central character or story, just a Halloween themed film that is meant to entertain the audience, and that it did. You can't really predict what happens in this film, aside from one of the stories. The other ones are just too far out there. You will feel more connected to some stories over others, the way the film plays out you can tell it is more interested in the ones it wants you to be interested in.The atmosphere here is great and it truly felt like Halloween night. As far as horror anthologies go, I'd say this is one of the better ones. I will say this though, this film has one of the best transformation scenes in horror. Watch the film and you'll know what I mean. Can I recommend this one? Sure, it's nothing too memorable, but it is indeed fun.",Trick 'r Treat
50,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Brilliant horror anthology, one of the best horror films in decades.",10,5 November 2017,"I've always had a weakness for anthology horror films, and this is easily one of the best I've seen, presenting five short stories, all running concurrently​, on Halloween night in this small town. A seemingly normal man is a killer, trying desperately hard to bury his latest victim, while his hyperactive son interferes, and a neighbour won't mind his own business. A, quite frankly, silly story about sexy Red Riding Hood, which is the only weak link, as far as I'm concerned, in terms of storytelling, but I dug the sexy costumes. A group of kids tell a savant a story of a horrific bus accident, before playing a cruel joke on her, only to meet their demise, as the Crux of the main plot kicks in, and vengeful souls rise from the dead. A girl who is bored with Halloween must deal with Halloween obsessed boyfriend, who doesn't want to take down his glorious decorations before Halloween is over. Then, the main point to the film kicks in, as the earlier mentioned vengeful souls seek to avenge their own deaths, by going Trick or Treating at the home of same man responsible for their deaths: the earlier mentioned neighbour, who won't mind his own business, right next door to the earlier mentioned killer, and right across the street from the earlier mentioned girl, and her Halloween obsessed boyfriend. Creepy, scary, with a good sense of humour, and very well written, and with a great attention to detail, as various characters from each segment seem almost as background extras in other segments they're not involved in, only to reappear as the main characters in a later vignette. Beautifully​ filmed, with rich, vibrant, realistic colours, not overly saturated with colour filters, this looks and feels like a small town at Halloween, The lore of Halloween, its appeal, is the inspiration here, how it can be a bit of a scare, but it can also be a lot of fun, often times simultaneously, just like this movie.",Trick 'r Treat
51,brando647,Embraces the Spirit of Halloween,8,24 July 2011,"I hope there was a good reason this film wasn't given nationwide release in theaters. A lot of the early reviews I'd read had spoke of how this film was one of the best Halloween-themed movies in years but for whatever reason (studio politics, I assume) it was shelved until it's eventual home release. It was excited to finally see it and it lived up to a lot of the hype. The film is an anthology of four stories occurring over Halloween night, with a introduction featuring the beautiful Leslie Bibb demonstrating what happens when you disrespect the spirits on All Hallows' Eve. The movie is R-rated, a pleasant surprise in a time where most horror movies soften their punches for the more popular PG-13 in an attempt to widen their audience. The film is also a nice break from the torture porn that's come to dominate the horror genre with films like SAW popping out every year or the gore-fests like the FINAL DESTINATION series. The film has it's share of bloody messes but it doesn't rely on it for the scares. TRICK 'R TREAT does a great job creating atmosphere and misdirecting the viewer to build tension.The movie has a fantastic cast with loads of familiar faces but without the distraction of an A-list star to hog the spotlight. Dylan Baker, primarily known (to me, anyway) for his role in the Sam Raimi SPIDER-MAN films as Dr. Curt Connors, leads the anthology in the first story as a school principal with some twisted Halloween rituals. Anna Paquin (the X-MEN films, HBO's ""True Blood"") is a virgin attending a Halloween party with a group of friends pressuring her to have her ""first experience"". In my favorite mini-story from the film, the ever-awesome Brian Cox is a curmudgeonly hermit who hates Halloween with a passion and comes face-to-face with a sack-masked little demon that I wish had been given the chance to become an horror icon in future anthology installments. Unfortunately, with the quiet, direct to home video release this movie received, the best to hope for is cult status in people finding this movie on their own. It's a brutal sequence in which Cox's character comes face-to-face with the spirit of Halloween and learns to play by the rules or die.The only story in the series that didn't break any new ground to me was the tale of a group of friends who decide to play a clichéd prank on a young girl, the town's idiot savant. Whereas the three other stories managed to catch my attention with their own twists, this story was a paint-by-numbers bit I'd seen before in countless Halloween-themed TV specials. It was predictable enough that I was able to call pretty much every point before it happened. Entertaining enough, I suppose, and it's not as if it ruined the movie. This film, from writer Michael Dougherty in his second directing gig, is a blast to watch. I hope the word of mouth gets around and it gets the attention it deserves. It's a creepy film and it totally embraces the spirit of the holiday. I know it'll become an annual staple every October for me.",Trick 'r Treat

I think the high point of the movie was the sequences with the kids because kids horror movie with R-rating really comes and director really spooked me off the only think I disliked was the ending, the ""Pumpkin Kid"" that was too much I would have liked a short creepy miniature man instead. The only recognizable faces in the movie were Anna Paquin and she looked adorable in Red Riding Hood Costume plus I loved her evil side as vicious Vampire.

58,oneguyrambling,"A direct to DVD release that is miles ahead of many ""big"" horror releases.",7,6 November 2010,"For like two years Trick R Treat never seemed to come off the ""Upcoming Releases"" list. I can't for the life of me see why.It might not be an all time great, but it is so much better than 20 odd absolute crapfests that were actually fast-tracked into cinemas over the last year to cash in on the current renaissance that horror has been enjoying lately.Examples? Orphan / The Last House on the Left / Halloween 2 / The Unborn / The Uninvited / Stepfather / Final Destination / Sorority Row Now re-read that list above and tell me what was a MUST SEE in cinemas.I'll wait Thought so.Trick R Treat is hardly a frightening flick, but it is sharp, clever, amusing, inventive and most of all fun. None of those words scream ""direct to DVD"" to me - but that is what happened anyway.Halloween has never really taken root in Australia, but over the last decade or so it has become more evident that Aussie kids are aware of the possibilities of free lollies and late nights, and the pressure seems to be going back on parents and homeowners to take it seriously. I know that we never bothered getting a serious stash of lollies ready until around three years ago, but this year our house got door-knocked at least 20 times.What has been true for many years is that horror movies are more popular around this time of year, as many are made for US release to coincide with the holiday.The plot of Trick R Treat is actually hard to describe, it is more a series of initially random events involving the same group of characters than a linear storyline. They all take place on Halloween (natch) in a small US town that obviously takes the night seriously.The main combatants of the film include: A young couple arriving home from the night's festivities, with the young woman knocking back a kind offer of intercourse in favour of cleaning up the Halloween decorations in the yard.The local school principal and his dealings with a trick or treater (played by the doofy kid from Bad Santa), which is interrupted by his son and a grumpy neighbour.Four nubile young skanks prepping for a night where they are all hoping to ""pull"", including two absolute hotties and a pair of sisters, one of whom is Anna Paquin as a somewhat reluctant trollop dressed as Red Riding Hood.A group of kids who attempt to pay respect to the victims of a past local tragedy involving a crashed school bus, and who rope in an unpopular young woman for the ceremony.And The afore-mentioned grumpy neighbour of the School Principal - obviously not a fan of Halloween - and his dealings with celebrating kids.Early on there are a few more fake scares than I would have liked, you know where the camera lingers, the music builds, the character's hand hovers and nothing happens. I started to worry that the release of the film was delayed with cause but thankfully that feeling was short lived.The plot interweaves ""Pulp Fiction"" style between the seemingly random events, and we gradually see how all these events are practically related, and often impact other character's stories later on, (or at times earlier on, there are a few flashbacks).There is also a little character in a sack over a pumpkin-head outfit who pops up in the periphery of all stories, he finally has his own scene near the very end in a scene that is worth the wait.How this wasn't released to cinemas is beyond me. It seems to have every key element required to cash in big time, it is funny, has some good scares, sexy teens and a little innuendo without overstepping the gore or bad taste boundaries. I would have thought with a little advertising and some word of mouth this would have seen a huge audience over the Halloween period from the teens that will - if we're honest - go and see almost anything anyway.It most certainly deserved far more than a direct to DVD release, hopefully the inevitable sequel sees a better fate.Final Rating – 7.5 – 10. A little tame to be considered a great horror film, this will find itself on a great many ""underrated"" lists in coming years, and will no doubt prove a great introduction to the horror genre for many curious teens in years to come. You could do an awful lot worse.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",Trick 'r Treat

61,hnt_dnl,"Nifty, thematic ""Halloween"" movie!",8,15 July 2012,"TRICK 'R TREAT (2007) is an entertaining anthology film that I would probably watch every Halloween just because it is a horror film that is mired in the holiday itself. It has it all: candy, costumes, trick-or-treaters, and pumpkins, pumpkins, and more pumpkins! Even though it only scratches the surface, this movie actually makes one want to know more about Halloween. In that regard, it's not the typical Hollywood horrorfest where the goal is solely to scare and shock the viewer. Using an array of urban legends, TrT molds together a fluid, well-written and acted set of interlocking tales set in a small town in Nowhere, USA.I saw it when it first came to cable back in '08 and was shocked to learn that this was direct-to-video! I've seen many ""films"" that should have been direct-to-video, but certainly not this one. This would have been a great film to release on the actual Halloween date back in 2007, but, que sera sera! At first look, I wasn't paying the best attention and thought it was overly complex. Upon second watch, I realized how confident a film it actually was.The main thing that I picked up on the second film was that the acting was much better than I realized the first time. The cast is a mix of knowns (Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Dylan Baker, Leslie Bibb) and unknowns (the kids in the bus-prank story), but even the known stars are not the biggest name stars so they fit in very nicely with the storyline and uplifting it with their talents. Paquin (who had won an Oscar at age 9 back in the early 90s) particularly impressed me is it's great to see that this young actress has managed to re-invent herself as an adult actress. Not to mention she is one of the sexiest-looking Red Riding Hoods I've ever seen! Veterans Baker and Cox are rock solid also as they have parts in more than one story.Interesting is that in addition to the adults, I was mightily impressed with the ""child"" actors in this! Quinn Lord (as the creepy, otherworldly, masked Sam, who is the central character to the over-arching Halloween plot) and Samm Todd (as the bullied, mentally challenged Rhonda) are impressive indeed, as well as the other kids that were a part of Rhonda's story. These parts were well-cast and performed.I think there are several themes going here, but the central one seems to be of retribution. Plain and simple, your bad deeds will come back and haunt you at some point, sometimes sooner, sometimes later. And it is all neatly tied in with showing respect to the ancient holiday. I'm a nut for nonlinear storytelling, so I was drawn in by the overlapping stories, whether connected or not. While not especially deep (as it's not really meant to be), TrT captures it's eerie vibe and the film has pristine cinematography, sharp dialog, smooth transitions from tale to tale. I will say that it demands repeat viewing as it is pretty neat to pick up on hints that were not so obvious the first time around. Highly recommended Halloween treat!",Trick 'r Treat
62,MrGKB,"More treat than trick, but ultimately disappointing...",6,28 May 2010,"...writer Michael ""X-Men 2"" Dougherty's feature directorial debut shows that he has some visual flair and an ability to coax decent performances from actors within the context of unremarkable material. Thus, despite the presence of notables like Dylan ""Happiness"" Baker, Brian ""Braveheart"" Cox, and Anna ""The Piano"" Paquin, along with a number of lesser lights, ""Trick 'r Treat"" remains little more than a timekiller, albeit not a completely worthless one.""Trick 'r Treat"" (which, btw, bears no relation whatsoever to the 80s Ozzy Osbourne vehicle) is another of those anthology films wrapped in comic book trimmings ala ""Creepshow"" with the meager distinction that its quartet of tales all intertwine within one neighborhood and often share characters. You've got your psycho school principal and his dutiful son, you've got your femme werewolves, you've got your old coot and his seasonal visitors, and you've got your taunting children who get their comeuppance. None of these vignettes are terribly memorable, sorry to say, and thus the structural conceit of the film loses much of its impact. Each story's faux-Henry ending is predictable and unexciting, and none live up to the standards set by E.C. Comics back in the 50s. Mr. Dougherty's original short, which is included in the DVD, is far superior to the feature film it inspired.This one gets points for some very nice cinematography from Glen ""Rambo"" MacPherson, a pretty good score from Douglas ""Monster House"" Pipes, some lovely art direction/production design, and overall decent acting. Beyond that, if this were a real comic book, it would be a read-once and throw away issue.",Trick 'r Treat

64,gregsrants,What a treat. Best Halloween film ever produced. BRAVO!,8,21 August 2009,"Over the past 12 months, I have heard countless good things about the horror film, Trick 'r Treat. How it was scary. How it was going to be a huge hit and the most talked about horror film since a hockey masked serial killer started stalking Camp Crystal Lake. How it won the Audience Award at Screamfest and how anyone who has seen the film on the festival circuit has wondered why the hell the film hasn't been recognized with a major distribution deal.Twelve months is a long time, and even with all the good buzz surrounding the film, I began to wonder if it was worth the hype. When I happened across the screening of the film as part of the Toronto After Dark Film Festival 2009, I did everything I could to get tickets (which simply meant going on-line and purchasing a pair). To add to my experience, I brought my girlfriend along who, as luck would have it, enjoys horror films about as much as Octomom enjoys feeding time. My girlfriend is a screamer and I knew she would spend most of the movie either digging her nails into my arm or watching the movie through the half inch space between her fingers over her eyes.This was going to be fun.As I arrived at the theatre, it was evident that I was not the only one who was incredibly excited about the screening. There was someone in line who I thought was going to pee himself in exhilaration waiting to be let into the theatre. Others were talking rather enthusiastically about what they had heard about the film and how they couldn't wait for the October DVD release (even though they had yet to see the damn thing!).As the lights went dim, the audience joined in whistles, cheers and applause. The Trick 'r Treating had begun.Trick 'r Treat interweaves multiple stories in an anthology. Think of Creepshow as done by Tarantino and you get the idea.The first story is short but sets the tone. It is only about 10 minutes (if that) in length and shows what can happen to you if you blow out the candle of a jack-o-lantern before midnight. This platform lead into four additional stories. One of an urban legend where a school bus of children went over a cliff, one of a school principle with serial killer tendencies, a story about a young girl trying to find a mate at a Halloween festival, and finally, a story about an old man who is haunted by a child like character (named Sam).All five of the stories were incredible interesting, wonderfully shot and gloriously thrilling. Directed by Michael Dougherty (X-Men 2, Superman Returns) the film featured familiar faces such as Anna Paquin (True Blod), Brian Cox (X-Men 2), Dylan Baker (Spider-Man) and Leslie Bibb.Each story was as good as the last. I thought they were all outstanding, and I now belong to the long list of screeners that wonder why the hell this film hasn't been able to secure a distribution deal. When horror films like Orphan and the Unborn can get wide releases, why can't a fantastically scary and well produced film like Trick 'r Treat get any respect? Trick 'r Treat is not the gore fest that many horror fans might be expecting. There are definitely elements of fright, but this is just good storytelling with a few scares and blood thrown in. There is some nudity, but nothing that should have this film slapped with a 'Restricted' banner.The movie arrives on DVD in October and there is no doubt it will instantly become a classic. I could argue that this is maybe the best Halloween film ever made as it truly captured everything that is loved and feared on October 31st.",Trick 'r Treat
65,cchase,It's Not The Tale - It's How It's Told That Counts!!!,8,13 February 2010,"TRICK 'R' TREAT sat by my DVD player for a good little while before I finally popped it in. The most recent mainstream horror offerings have been such letdowns of late, that I proceed with caution on almost anything I see that's not a remake. (And don't get me started on remakes!) Now I regret having waited so long.Writer/director Michael Dougherty obviously knows and loves his anthologies...everything from the classic CREEPSHOW to the Hammer Studios greatest hits of yore like TALES FROM THE CRYPT and ASYLUM. There isn't any particular tale in his film that I could call strikingly original, but it's been one helluva long time since I've seen a film more stylishly or even-handedly presented. Weaving together about a half-dozen interlocking stories, rather than doing each as a stand-alone tale as in George Romero's cult hit, TRICK 'R' TREAT employs everything eerie, unsettling and ghoulishly fun about the holiday to explore the classic campfire tropes that everybody knows and loves, but this time with plenty of fatalism mixed with liberal doses of good, hearty black humor. The lone virgin in a group of her costumed girlfriends is stalked by a shadowy figure; a small-town principal moonlights as a serial killer, who treats himself to more than a few gory tricks at his victims' expense; a group of teenagers single out one of their peers for a Halloween Night prank that goes wrong in a way they could've never imagined; the neighborhood curmudgeon who is basically the ""Ebenezer Scrooge"" of All Hallows' Eve, gets his comeuppance when his secret past comes to call, and a couple of partygoers find out the hard way why you should NEVER, EVER blow out your Jack O' Lantern early on Halloween Night. Featuring a cast of actors who either weren't big names when they did this, or recognizable character actors who are known for their great performances, the lineup includes TRUE BLOOD'S Anna Paquin, BSG's Tahmoh Penikett, CSI's Lauren Lee Smith, Dylan Baker and Brian Cox, who gives a well-done turn as the grizzled ""mean old man"", that CREEPSHOW'S late, great E.G. Marshall could appreciate. Co-produced by Bryan Singer under his Bad Hat Harry Films banner, it's obvious from the production values that Dougherty was given plenty of resources (read: $$$) to go out and make the film he wanted. It's not so much puzzling as it is infuriating that it never got the full promotional push from Warner's that it deserved, (possibly because of the angle of putting kids in jeopardy and not flinching from the horrific consequences, even in a fantasy context.) However, it's a fortunate thing that the DVD format allows films like this to find an audience, rather than slipping unnoticed into a dusty archive somewhere, never to see the light of day. Kudos to Mr. Dougherty and his cast and crew for putting together what deserves to become a Halloween staple. For my part, it's going on my library shelf right between perennial favorites CREEPSHOW and CARRIE, and like them, it will get played a lot more often than just at ""candy-and-costumes"" time.",Trick 'r Treat
66,witster18,Check Your Candy!,7,11 December 2009,"It nearly goes without being said - that you should pass on this if you don't care for the horror genre. Trick r' Treat is definitely more of a treat, and not a one-trick-pony.You can always tell when a first-time director puts his heart and soul into a project - allowing his artistic abilities and his commitment take over . Kurt Wimmer with Equilibrium comes to mind... a few others.... Tarantino/Reservoir Dogs... Kevin Smith/Clerks... Sure, that's lofty company, but director Michael Dougherty has sent out a strong statement with his first feature film.Trick 'r Treat has two elements that set it apart. The first is its' uncanny awareness of Hallow's Eve, and all that comes with it. Jack-o-lanterns, Sex, Pranks, Ghouls, Goblins, Zombies, Vampires(or so it seems), Werewolves, and tainted candy bars. The second element is how Dougherty meshes all of those familiar Halloween themes, and blends them together - tying them together with time and circumstance.This movie isn't all that scary. There are a few genuinely creepy moments, but the director has succeeded mightily in creating an original work. There are some elements that you may have to piece together after viewing this film. In other words - it's smart. It doesn't overstay it's' welcome either. At just over an hour, Trick r' Treat is like 'a quicky' before work - it's naughty in nature, fast, but somehow manages to put you in a great mood. There are some purposeful, comical elements that add to what is a surprisingly playful entry to the genre.Now the movie isn't perfect(Nor should it be expected to be from a first time director). The complaints are minimal though. One unnecessary and unrealistic animatronic shot of a werewolf howling and one unexplained situation with a Vampire bite. Both are excusable and neither takes too much away from what is a great ride. The film could have possibly used some extra time to create a little more genuine scare value.The comic book theme has been done before(Creepshows), but Dougherty takes great care with how he infuses it in the beginning and ending of the film without getting that 'we've seen this before' vibe.Horror buffs will love this film. I love it. No academy awards. No sleepless nights. No torture shot after torture shot. Just good old-fashioned Halloween fun.Sam only requires two things from the mortals. 1.Give him some candy 2.Don't blow out the jack-o-lanterns until tomorrow. Hope this helps.76/100",Trick 'r Treat

This movie was quite a bit of fun don't get me wrong but thats all it is. A stupid B movie to laugh that is all. Its not scary at all the acting is sub par and the make up effects are garbage.This movie follows 4 different groups of people and their experiences on halloween. The four don't know each other but little do they know all their halloween experiences are interconnected.This movie is not all bad. Like I said its a fun movie just to laugh at. Or maybe a softer horror movie to put on for the young kids at halloween.

69,Superunknovvn,"Very charming, lots of fun",7,20 November 2009,"""Trick 'r Treat"" is probably what they intended ""Halloween III"" to be: A fun little horror movie that takes place at and revolves around Halloween. The episodic structure of the movie and the comic book background are reminiscent of George A. Romero's ""Creepshow"" and ""Tales From The Crypt"".Although there is a certain amount of gore and some nudity this never feels like ""hardcore horror"", but more like a movie you could enjoy on a rainy afternoon with your kids... and that's a good thing. We've had so many shocking, violence-laden movies lately, that this is a very welcomed return to the more light-hearted, charming horror of our childhood.""Trick 'r Treat"" never strives to be special or meaningful. The episodes aren't especially original or disturbing, but director/screenwriter Michael Dougherty proves that you can breathe life into a horror movie just by taking it seriously, by putting your soul into it. The settings are atmospheric, the cinematography is inspired and beautiful. Some scenes are blatantly stolen from other movies (a scene that involves a little person slicing a grown-ups heel from underneath the bed is taken right out of ""Pet Semetary"", then we got the hand with a life of its own, that we've all seen before in ""Evil Dead II"", the Addams family movies and even ""Waxwork II: Lost In Time""). However, these moments seem more like respectful nods to the movies we enjoyed as kids.""Trick 'r Treat"" has got its heart in the right place. It's the perfect movie for Halloween. It's charming and lots of fun. Great to see that there are still people like Dougherty out there who make old fashioned horror movies like this one.",Trick 'r Treat
70,DonFishies,"There is a lot to like, but too much to be disappointed by too",7,21 October 2009,"Trick 'r Treat tells an anthology of tales all revolving around the same small town on Halloween night, and all involving the strangely costumed child Sam in one capacity or another. High school principal Steven (Dylan Baker) moonlights as someone not so ""friendly"", while Laurie (Anna Paquin) is in town with her friends for a party and looking to lose her virginity. At the same time, a group of children attempt to pay homage to a town legend, and Mr. Kreeg (Brian Cox) receives an unwanted visitor.For such a short film, I was very impressed by how much writer/director Michael Dougherty managed to fuse into Trick 'r Treat. Rather impressively, it manages to move swiftly from story to story with little problems. Characters are involved in all the stories, mainly as a means of setting the timeline for the film, but it is done in a way that it does not feel blatant or forced. Their appearances all feel natural, and make the film feel like one grand overarching story, as opposed to four smaller ones (and one even smaller story that acts as a means of framing the timing of the whole film). While I am not always a fan of films that are wound and wrapped up so tightly that virtually no questions are left unanswered to the imagination, Trick 'r Treat manages to tie up virtually everything, but still leaves a lot for the viewer to figure out themselves.What is also rather well done is how revelations are handled in the film. While it jumps around timelines quicker than a Tarantino movie would, it manages to never waste any of the scares, shocks or turns the film takes. While some are rather predictable, others come totally out of nowhere leaving the viewer either confused or impressed that it managed to avoid obvious genre stereotypes. The film also replays more than a few moments from different points-of-view, rewarding the attention of some astute viewers with a new take on each scene. It may wear off after the first viewing, but still manages to be a rather unique notion for anyone not knowing what to expect the first time they watch Trick 'r Treat.The characterization of basically any character in the film however, is not so great. Since the film runs only at 82-minutes, we only get a small glimpse into who each person is. When we are treated to some of the shocks, they only manage to be shocks because the one-dimensional banality of some of these characters leaves no other emotional response to give. Worse yet, some of these characters are given such a little amount of emphasis that you could care less what happens to them. They are not painted with the same brush as the typical horny teenagers in a Friday the 13th movie or the sinners and losers of a Saw film, but they just lack the finesse or desire to rise above being grouped in a similar category.What is really disappointing though is that the film is just not that great. It was delayed for over two years, and it shows in how close ended the film is. Some characters are just too weak to have their own story lines, and they make the film feel like it is dragging its heels. I said I was impressed at how much is here, but only at the sheer quantity of it all. Quality is a totally different story. Some parts, even with the one-sided character traits, are much better written and much better edited than others. The early darkly comic actions of Baker's principal are so enjoyable that his later actions come off as just being silly and unneeded. The overarching storyline feels like some emphasis could have been taken off some stories, and added to others. While it does all jive together in the end, it easily could have come together a lot nicer.The acting leaves a bit to be desired as well. For the most part, Baker delivers a solid performance throughout his running time. Even when his character's actions get silly, he manages to still be more than watchable. Yet another great character performance to add to his filling repertoire. Cox is another great example of shining through despite what material he is given. He does not get many lines, but his story is easily the most satisfying because of how strong his actions are. But sadly, being part of a larger ensemble gives neither man the time to really develop their characters as much as they could have. The group of kids manages to fulfill their roles as annoying and clueless kids nicely, but never really give as much into their performances as the two heavy hitters. Even the usually reliable Paquin feels wasted in her role, despite how great her Little Red Riding Hood imagery goes throughout the film.Despite some problems that run throughout Trick 'r Treat, the inclusion of the enigmatic Sam is what really makes the film worthwhile. He spends most of the movie skulking behind-the-scenes, showing up in each of the stories but never really doing much. When he does react, it borders between chilling and frightening. Remember the first time you encountered Jigsaw? Freddy Krueger? Michael Myers? This is the birth of a new horror icon, albeit one that may stay in the realm of cult status. Every answer leads to another question about him. Just looking at an image of the character is scary enough, learning that he was portrayed by the incredibly young Quinn Lord? Downright terrifying.I wanted to love Trick 'r Treat, but there is a little too much wrong with the film. There is a lot to like, but there is a lot to be disappointed by too. I only wish I did not have over two years to build up any hype.7.5/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",Trick 'r Treat
71,gigan-92,A Fantastic Horror Film for Many a Reason,10,15 March 2012,"Anyone who knows their horror well knows George Romero got inspiration for his masterpieces by reading the EC Horror comics which thrived before the strict regulations that arrived in the 50s. Modern horror (""The Uninvited"", ""Quarantine"", and ""Paranormal Activity"") is more often than not a disappointment, but gems like this occasionally come along and sweep you off your feet. Its cinematographic style pays tribute to the EC horror comics beautifully. The film itself is a demented horror-comedy, spliced with an intriguing mystery storyline. It pays awesome tribute to the classic horror monsters, as well as delivering quite nicely many surprises.And the acting is so great. Dylan Baker is the sadistic town principal and anybody (even though I loved ""Bad Santa"") who hates Brett Kelly gets to watch the little bastard suffer quite extensively. You can tell Bryan Singer was producing due to the number of X-Men actors in the film. The gorgeous Anna Paquin stars as well as Brian Cox (who played the maniacal role of Stryker in X2). If you're a horror buff, you'll note the makeup is made to reassemble John Carpenter himself, how awesome.Definitely check out this elaborate pastiche to the horror genre.",Trick 'r Treat
72,dfa120374,A Pretty Boring Halloween Horror,4,16 January 2015,"Four stories are interwoven into one film during one Halloween evening. A high school principal has an alter life as a serial killer; a couple find out what happens after blowing out the candles in their Jack-o-lanterns & taking their Halloween decorations down before midnight; a group of young girls have a party but they aren't exactly what they appear to be; and a group of young teens take a cruel prank too far.Trick 'r Treat is pretty much a campy, cheesy Halloween horror flick and nothing more. At first I thought this movie was a kind of ""four short stories"" movie like Creepshow & Tales From The Crypt, but it's actually a Pulp Fiction style of horror where the stories all criss-cross with each other.The stories all mingle in together pretty well to be honest but if you don't follow what's going on you can get somewhat lost. In all honesty though, that's no big deal because you don't miss much if that happens. Apart from a couple of creepy moments in the movie (and I think it would have been much better if it were that style of movie instead of a cheesy slasher flick), you're not really missing much and there are definitely a good amount of face palm moments.There are a few good black humour moments, but those don't really make up for the overall bore factor. There's a couple of actors that you will recognise with Brian Cox and Anna Paquin, but even they can't do much to make this mediocre horror movie any better. I have no idea how people can rate this movie so highly, but each to their own I suppose.Just don't expect that great a movie and as long as you don't take it that seriously then you will probably be fine with this film.",Trick 'r Treat
73,doctorsmoothlove,Tricked but no treat,7,7 February 2010,"Trick 'r Treat is a strange, sad little horror movie. It is a celebration of the many things that went wrong with the genre in the mid to late '80's. It is presented as an anthology, set on Halloween night, and was recently released on home video. I went to Wikipedia, where I learned that it was supposed to be released theatrically in October 2007. For whatever reason, Warner Bros. shelved it for two years. This has had the effect of creating a rallying point for underground horror fans. The movie has the production values of a Hollywood film but the appeal of an indie. It has received nearly universal positive reviews from specialist online critics Until Now! No, I did not hate Trick 'r Treat. But, I think many people are being blinded by its rags-to-straight-to-video-riches history. My problem with it is its violation of its own movie-world rules (bad homage 1). This film introduces a new knife-wielder, but one who clearly is not human. ""Sam"" is a cute little demon with a rag doll body (think Sackboy) that spends his time making sure people respect the traditions of Halloween night. The movie doesn't bother to explain what these traditions are, but I guess they involve not playing pranks, going to parties, or handing out candy to children. The film simultaneously celebrates and castigates Halloween festivities and because it establishes no basis for what is proper or improper behavior, and becomes a guessing game of who will die next and what makeup effects will be employed (bad homage 2).Four events compose the film's story and Sam is a part of each. They are: a young couple that disagrees on whether to remove Halloween decorations before daybreak, a school principle that lures female victims to their deaths while wearing a vampire costume and finding human play-things for his boy (by murdering trick-or-treaters), sexy werewolf girls parading as sluts for unsuspecting male party-goers, and a group of kids who visit a lake where a bus of mentally handicapped children drowned only to be attacked zombies. Some of the stories are linked by other characters, such as an elderly man that lives near the vampire principal, was also the operator of the school bus.Sam is usually the divine (or maybe infernal) agent of punishment in all of these vignettes. His character doesn't fit into any one of the stories out of necessity and weaves in and out of the stories sewing up plot inconsistencies (bad homage 3). The film should have integrated the four stories into one definitive narrative and set each baddie up for his or her demise within the context of another situation. This does happen twice, which gives glimpse of what might have been. The vampire principal is one of the werewolf girls' victims, and the old bus driver is dispatched by zombie children who kill the mischievous kids. The opening scenes with the couple, one of whom Sam murders, is entirely pointless. Maybe if that portion, along with the sub-plot involving the vampire principal's son were removed, I could recommend it.The film even presents its female characters in each of the three main horror-film sexist stereotypes (bad homage 4). The woman Sam murders in the opening deliberately goes out of her way to destroy Halloween decorations (the bitch archetype). The werewolf girls use their sexuality to lure victims to their deaths at a party (the sexy-girl-whose-appearance-has-no-plot-relevance-archetype). And, finally, the kids at the lake dress as zombies to scare a nerdy girl who is the only survivor when the real zombies appear (the lone girl archetype). Some of these situations create unintentional laughs (see any scene featuring the werewolf girls), but none of them are ever scary.

74,harryplinkett14,Offensive exploitation,1,3 June 2017,"One thing that instantly strikes the viewer is the format stolen from 'Creepshow'. It also becomes clear fairly quickly that this film is much worse than the one it rips off.While both films employ gratuitous violence, 'Creepshow' does it in a well conceived tongue-in-cheek manner. This film is just a load of violence that has no appeal whatsoever. The stories are not clever, they are very derivative and just a re-packaging of overused templates.Just as the violence is used in a misguided manner, so too is everything else between the violent scenes. This is particularly the case with scenes that play upon eroticism. They are very vulgar and unpleasant to watch.

As with all anthologies, it's best to see it story by story.The opening bit with the couple (Leslie Bibb & Tahmoh Penikett) doesn't get too involved, but it is quite fun. The Michael Myers-like Peeping Tom opening was a nice homage back to the ultimate of Halloween horrors. It previews a bit of brutality with a wicked sense of humour that would continue on through the film.The story of the principal (Dylan Baker) starts out a bit slow; but, by the end, really gains steam and ends up being painfully disturbing and darkly funny, commenting on one of the most creepy parts of Halloween (especially for those with children). A good performance by Baker is featured and it really works well.Anna Paquin's story (along with her gang of Hallo-whores) was not as interesting when she wasn't around (couldn't care less about her trampy friends, to be honest), but when she was, it was fairly good. Not my favourite, but the payoff was actually quite cool.Brian Cox's segment was a fine example of Halloween-style suspense and exhibits one of the best slasher weapons I've ever seen (the razor blade in the candy bar). The strangely cute Sam was both creepy and funny (although once the sack is removed, he wasn't nearly as cute or funny). The first ending was funny, even if it did feel a bit like an over-the-top Snickers commercial. The real ending: even better.My favourite story, easily, was of the bus prank. The children were surprisingly good actors and the mood was set perfectly. It didn't have the humour of some of the other story lines and went more for direct atmosphere and scares, succeeding wonderfully. Had the other stories failed for me, this one alone would have made the watch worth my time.The film contains some fantastic imagery, amazingly capturing the Halloween season. One of the best shots the film offers is actually one of the best I've seen in a long time, a bleeding corpse left lying in the middle of a crowd for all to see. . . with no one caring. Overall, if you're looking for a great way to spend an October night, definitely pick this one up. As an anthology, it works very well; but, as an overall film, it's even better. Along with classics like Carpenter's Halloween, The Lady in White, and others, Trick 'r Treat is sure to be a staple of Halloween-time horror nights for a long time.Final Verdict: 7.5/10.-AP3-",Trick 'r Treat
77,hellholehorror,Thrills throughout,9,6 January 2018,It looked amazing. From the opening titles to the beautiful flashback sequence to the stunning camera moves to the creepy monsters this all looks really good. Some of the angles were amazing and so was the movement. Subtle yet powerful sound design. This sounded amazing. A really good mix. Simple yet effective. This was really well paced. It was fast moving with lots of twists. There was never a dull moment except a few seconds that could have been shaved here and there. It wasn't that scary and thankfully it wasn't that gory. It is just a really well made horror movie with thrills throughout. Good solid thrill ride with fantastic pace. Not too extreme either!,Trick 'r Treat
78,willcundallreview,A fun if not slightly overrated Halloween horror,6,22 October 2015,"Ah Halloween, the one time of year where the spirits of the dead come alive and it's acceptable to wear nothing but orange. With this season comes of course the steady stream of horror movies which are also quite often not the best watches, and I don't mean their too scary. Trick 'r Treat is a horror movie with a difference and really plays out in a way you would never quite imagine, I personally felt it didn't come off as well as it might think but it is still a worthy watch and not just on Halloween. The movie is set up like a comic book and many scenes are accompanied by some well done comic book pages usually showing the aftermath of what has just transpired before. The story follows many people doing fairly ordinary Halloween activities but it shakes it up a little and really changes typical things we see in horror movies to create a new and fairly refreshing type of film. We see a slightly weird teacher, a group of girls looking for some fun and many other people who seem to pop up along the way. The plot is very connected and some meet each other or more they walk right past each other leading into another line of the many stories. I found the plot alright and really nothing too special although it is as said before refreshing, the added addition of Sam the little trick-or-treater is pretty fun but also kind of dark and twisted too making this not just a slasher, but also in some ways disturbing. It is Michael Dougherty who really brings this to the big screen, he develops a short film of his that features Sam and turns it into a feature length horror movie. I like way in which Dougherty sets it up in the way that the streets are always dark but the lighting is fantastic and that warm orange glow feels like an ever present safety around all of the darkness that is going on around it. Although the film may look nice I do feel the movie lacks in the way it still feels like a typical horror movie even though the film thinks it is much different to the ordinary, a lot of the stories play out normally with the odd one changing it up, but even then it isn't always excellently done. Now I'm not saying this is not a watch I recommend far from it, for all the horror movie fans out there this is especially for you and even those who maybe claim to dislike the genre I feel could still like this one. It's not that the plot is boring that I do not say this is entirely good but only that it just doesn't always play out the best, some of the writing can be a little shoddy and Dougherty also when directing can make the movie feel comedic and yet then make it suddenly turn serious and it doesn't work that way. So overall if you are looking for horror then I couldn't recommend this more, I am not 100% sure why so many people find this amazing but I can partly see why. The movie is after all different and brings a whole lot of new twists and turns to the party, also the acting is satisfactory meaning some of the characters are fun and you can either kind of like, hate or both given this is a messed up kind of film. In the end though I feel it is little Sam who really stands out, not only because the costume is oddly cute but also that it is such a distinguishable character and one that sticks out after finishing this.",Trick 'r Treat

There's no doubt the film rolled out an entertaining and original set of stories, characters and scares. Sam, the iconic small bag headed serial killer was a marvelously designed villain that likely attracted the huge confluence of fans. The timeline of events was also shot with great precision, having to balance the perfect amount of time to creating multiple fluid story but also having to keep the viewer interested in the people and plot. It would have been better with a better cast but its hard to pick apart a fun show such as Trick 'r Treat. A must watch for those who call themselves horror fans around Halloween.",Trick 'r Treat

Meshing comedy and horror so seamlessly, and telling very entertaining and well-tied together stories taking place on Halloween. This is a good halloween based movie.The film tells four interconnected stories about murder and supernatural activity on one particular Halloween night. Not told in linear order, it's kind of fun to piece together the film, leaving the audience to think about the film, after watching it.I was very invested in the characters and the story when watching the film.Some stories were actually chilling to watch. The film knew when to be funny and when to be scary.
The movie, with the costumes, sets, and lighting really sets the tone and atmosphere of the film.Overall, I liked this film. Give it a watch, you will enjoy it.",Trick 'r Treat
84,fil-nik09,Hmmm...,4,20 May 2016,"First of all, this review may contain spoilers! :)I just finishes watching this film. IMDb put out some Children of horror article on facebook and as a fan of horror films I did go through and somehow ended up on this film. I was intrigued it has good note so wanted to watch it, but, now, after... I see I could have seen something better.First of all, this film is so random! There are several stories which are kinda related to each other but very loosely. I can not say this is a horror movie as the scenes are not really horror or particularly gore. There is some blood and some unusual creatures, but many scenes are more like a comedy and do intend to make people laugh. I did not laugh. I was more wondering what the hell?! And I am not sure if those scenes which are homage to other films are intentional or not ( Adams Family comes to mind).There are some surprising scenes - like when the dad who killed the boy by poisonous candy is walking behind his son with a big knife and you - of course - expect daddy to kill his son - only to find that the kid is making a 'pumpkin ' out of the dead kid's head ! Now, that is something! And almost in the beginning of the movie. Unfortunately, after that no real surprises ( good ones).Ah, yes, it was a surprise to see who is the driver who killed all those disturbed kids.All in all ... rather uninspiring film. I give it a four.",Trick 'r Treat
85,jackmeat,Where has this movie been hiding?,8,1 November 2019,"My quick rating 7,5/10. How in the world did this movie sit unwatched by myself for this long? This is an instant classic for Halloween viewing for sure. The flick is an anthology movie of sorts. Each story flows within the context of the whole movie, which is all tied together throughout in such a masterful way, it is near genius. Every bit of scary stories any child in the USA has grown up hearing is reflected in the shorts of this, be it razor blades in candy, or the bus of kids off the cliff, werewolves, vampires, anything that goes bump in the night is all fair game in this film. Michael Dougherty helms the whole shabang and does an incredible job. Each story in its isolation is instantly tied into the story as a whole in a unique way. Much to be said for the editing and continuity department on keeping this all inline. Wonderful shots of decorated homes, great casting including the ever talented Anna Paquin and all the kids really. So much great stuff to be had in this flick. If you haven't seen it, make this top priority on your list for the next All Hallows Eve, as this movie isn't just around the Halloween holiday, but embodies everything Halloween, the day/night is. If this wasn't just an everyday review, I would get into how this movie could be the single best Halloween film ever made just because it is Halloween, whereas the movie ""Halloween"" could be any other day of the year, and still be a masterpiece.

86,loomis78-815-989034,The best Halloween themed movie since Carpenter's 1978 classic.,10,5 August 2015,"A four part anthology movie with all four stories interwoven together taking place in a small town in Ohio on Halloween night. The clever tales have characters from each story crisscrossing each other and a wraparound that features the spirit of Halloween itself, known as Sam. We don't know what Sam (Quinn Lord) is exactly, until the final story, but the story tells us that if anyone disgraces the rules and traditions of the holiday Halloween, they will have to answer to Sam. The opening scene shows Emma (Leslie Bibb) blowing out her pumpkins before midnight and she is attacked in a bloody way by Sam. One story revolves around a middle age man named Steven (Baker) who is also the principal of the local school. This unpleasant sort poisons kids and teaches his young son (Connor Levins) about his grisly Halloween night tradition. Another story follows four hot young women who are in town to pick up men. The shy one of the group, Laurie (Paquin), is having trouble picking up a guy until she runs into Steven from the first story. She brings him to a party in the woods where the girls shed their skins and reveal themselves as savage werewolves who rip the men (Including Steven) to shreds. Another story centers on a practical joke set up by 3 early teens on an idiot-savant character named Rhonda (Todd). Years earlier a school bus carrying the towns' mentally disabled children had an accident that left the kids dead. The town people wanted it, and the bus driver took the wrap. Rhonda is brought to an abandoned rock quarry where the incident took place and she is terrorized by the story and the kids joke until the ghosts of the bus kids return for real and Rhonda may have the last laugh. The final story revolves around Mr. Kreeg (Cox) a sour old man whose yard is a mess and he hates everyone. He's watching TV on an old set and playing pranks trick or treater's with his dog until Sam (Short for Samhain) pays him a vicious visit and shows him not to disrespect the holiday. There are several great twists including the true identity of Mr. Kreeg and an even more chilling visit he gets at his door after Sam is done terrorizing him. This brilliant horror film from Writer/Director Michael Dougherty mysteriously sat on the shelf for almost three years until finally being dumped to disc without a theatrical release. Thanks Warner Bros, you just stiffed one of the best Horror films made in the past 15 years! Trick 'r Treat has it all, everything that a horror fan could want. A more than clever story, Suspense, chills, atmosphere, gore and blood, humor, great effects, scares and an iconic character in Sam. Depending on what you like in your horror film will determine which story you like best here but it is guaranteed you will like something. It is quite amazing that Dougherty was able to put all this together and not have it be lopsided somehow, but this movie literally has everything a horror film should have and more than most. Fans who enjoy the holiday 'Halloween' and like Horror films who use the holiday, this is your mother lode. Not since John Carpenter's classic ""Halloween"" in 1978 has the night of October 31 been as fun and scary as it is here. Simply a must see for any serious modern horror film fan. The only thing that would have made viewing this film any better, would have been seeing it on a big screen on a cold and windy night in late October! Thanks for screwing that up completely Warner Bros, shame on you.",Trick 'r Treat
87,dasa108,With just a decent sequence it barely beats mediocrity,5,1 November 2021,"Like so many other movies we have several intertwined stories (as in Creepshow 3). Although some of them have humor, irony and invite us to expect something above our expectations, the highlights are the usual ones. Despite this, it is not horrible but it does not fulfill what we expected: if a large studio and important people like Bryan Singer are behind it, it would have to have better quality. Sadly, Hollywood cannot be trusted for years.",Trick 'r Treat
88,Quebec_Dragon,It's a treat to watch and you will get tricked,7,1 November 2009,"Trick R Treat mixes 4 (5 if you count the short intro) intertwined Halloween themed tales into one bigger story taking place in the same little town. It feels like some kind of cross between the Twilight Zone, comic books and Goosebumps. It's more like small fantastical short stories with horror elements than outright horror. For a while, I thought it would be perfect as a scary children movie (several parts involve kids) but there's a bit of profanity, some flash of naked breasts and a couple bloodier parts but rather modest compared to what we're now used to. As it is, it would be better for teens and adults who still like Halloween as it does capture its fun spirit. The first story (not counting the intro) starring a principal and an obnoxious kid was quite amusing with a neat surprise ending. The actor playing the principal was just wonderful. The second story is a must-see for fans of True Blood as Anna Paquin plays a shy young woman dressed as little red riding hood being prodded by her sister and friends into hooking up with someone for a party. Let's just say she might not meet a normal guy in those streets. It was fun, surprising and the sexiest tale of the bunch.The story with the most Halloween vibe involves a bunch of kids trick or treating and then going to a place where the Halloween school bus massacre occurred. I loved the cinematography and the characterization of the kids (especially the little witch) although like the rest of the stories it wasn't really scary. The last story involves your old cranky mean type who hates Halloween getting a lesson from the little scarecrow-head guy from the cover appearing throughout the film. It's probably the weakest tale although the ending makes up for it. As a matter of fact, several characters pop in and out of other stories which was a neat well-implemented idea. My main criticism, and a minor one at that, would be that some of the masks for the more supernatural creatures looked a bit fake but I suppose it could have been worse with computer imagery. I think Trick R Treat is a very good choice for Halloween viewing or with candies after Halloween. You've got lots of Christmas themed movies each year, Halloween movies that are fun, enjoyable and not too extreme or serious are a much rarer treat.Rating: 7 out of 10",Trick 'r Treat

The stories knit seamlessly together and there are enough surprises to keep you guessing.OK so it's not Shakespeare, but it's a great example of how a movie should be made, and provides all the entertainment you need on Halloween or any other night. A lot of work goes into making a good film, and this one shows how getting the right people in front of and behind the camera makes all the difference between producing a lemon or a lovely warm squishy pumpkin.",Trick 'r Treat
90,TheRedDeath30,Movie has Become a Halloween Staple in My Home,9,29 October 2014,"This is one of those movies that I find my appreciation for it grows with each repeated viewing. Part of that lies in the fact that there was so much hype for this movie, in horror circles, when it finally saw the light of day a few years back. With as many glowing reviews as I had seen, it was hard to match the expectation at first and I suppose, like many viewers, I wanted something a little scarier or creepier.The more that I've watched the movie, though, the more I've come to appreciate just how good it is. It incorporates just about every aspect of the Halloween holiday that you can think of and melds together into a movie that may not be all that gory or violent and may not have a HELLRAISER kind of chilliness to it, but is an absolute blast from start to finish, presented with a maniacal, childlike glee as it examines the scariest parts of Halloween night.In case you have been hiding under a rock, the movie is an anthology, produced and directing by some of the talent behind some comic book movies from a few years back like X2 and SUPERMAN RETURNS. That background is really evident here, as the movie often feels very much like an old pulp comic and several moments have that EC Comics ""Tales from the Crypt"" vibe. Unlike the standard horror anthology, though, this is not presented in episodic fashion. In most, you have a framing narrative that cuts from one story to the next, resolving one before moving to another and interspersing them with the framing story. Here, the movie moves fluidly back and forth among the stories. It never feels to erratic and knows when to stop and focus on each individual story before cutting back to another, thereby establishing a tonal consistency that's rare in most anthologies. Even when one story seems to have concluded, the characters often reappear for a moment or two, connecting each of them in the timeline.The first, short story stars Leslie Bibb and concerns the reason you shouldn't blow out the Jack-O-Lantern candles before bed. It's a quick story to bring some action to the film immediately and provides a few effective scares.""The Principal"" features a good turn from Dylan Baker as a school principal with some dark secrets in a story that explores the reasons you should always check your candy. It's chock full of nods to Halloween lore and comes a twisted little surprise ending. There's a Charlie Brown reference and it does feel, to me, the most like a macabre version of a kid's Halloween cartoon.""The School Bus Massacre Revisited"" is the standard story of a joke played on the weird kid, who ends up turning the tables in the end. It's probably my favorite of the segments in the movie. It feels like a Spielberg kids movie done by a demented imagination. I love the imagery throughout this segment, starting with the introduction to Rhonda and her yard full of incredible carved pumpkins. The creepy, fog-filled quarry is a perfect backdrop and the story told of past events is well-shot. I love the of-kilter homemade costumes on the kids in the bus which have a super creepy feel to them. I appreciate that the murders are left unshown as Hollywood long ago forgot that our imaginations are often far worse than any effects.""Surprise Party"" might be the weak link in the movie. We follow some teen girls on Halloween night in what feels, at first, like the most cliché of the segments as we think we are in ""teens will get killed in the woods"" territory. The story takes a turn when we meet a serial killer of sorts with a vampire obsession, who picks the wrong victim to prey on. I will give credit because I never saw the twist coming and I like the transformation effects used in the final scene. I'm just not too fond of the ""end product"" (I'm trying to be vague so as not to spoil too much obviously). ""Sam"" is where the movie places full focus on one of the best horror movie villains in some years, a cute lil killer named Sam who is present in all of the segments, but gets a starring role here as assaults a grumpy, old drunk to teach him the true meaning of the holiday. There is so much to like here. I enjoy the little candy- themed weapons that Sam employs. I love the Phantom-style face reveal when the mask is pulled off him. I think they gave it a clever ending, as well, both in the resolution of Sam's story and in the final climax of the movie itself.I give HUGE nods to this movie for the use of practical effects. I am not an absolute CGI hater. I think that they can be done well, but far too often are not, especially in a lower budget movie and they age far more than practical effects. Watch CGI from ten years ago and tell me honestly it still looks good, but watch practical effects from 30 years ago and they still maintain their appeal. Maybe I'm just old school, but I appreciate the use of practical effects here.To say this is the best Halloween movie is obviously wrong because Carpenter's HALLOWEEN is the benchmark there. However, you will not find anything out there that utilizes the imagery and folklore of Halloween better than this movie. It just bleeds Hallow's Eve black and orange and is an absolute must watch in my opinion.",Trick 'r Treat
91,bababear,It Promises...but Can't Quite Deliver,6,18 February 2011,"I watched this thinking, wow, this is going to get really good. But after just a tad over an hour the closing credits were rolling and I was, at best, disappointed.The film was originally designed for theatrical release, but that never happened. Why? Possibly because of the two main flaws that hurt it consistently. There are really no characters the viewer can like or identify with. But, worse yet, it's very violent and the vast majority of the violence is initiated by and against children.When the first child starts projectile vomiting blood I thought this was going to turn out to be a sight gag. Nope. In all about a dozen children bite the dust over the course of the film.It's wonderfully photographed. The central idea of a town in Ohio (it was actually filmed on great locations in Vancouver, British Columbia) that takes Halloween way too seriously had promise. The director's handling of a very complex time structure was admirable. Better yet, there are some dynamite actors on hand here....who are given very little to do that is worthy of their talent.And worse yet, it wasn't really scary. There wasn't a single moment that made me jump, or one character whose welfare I was concerned for.There's also an uncertainty of tone here. At one point it seems that a subplot will be resolved with a variation on Dickens's A Christmas CAROL. Then the writer decides, no, let's just revisit CREEPSHOW and dozens of other similarly themed works.And there were unanswered questions, too. Is every Halloween in this town like this, or is this one unique? And when we find out one character's Big Secret, all I could think was what he had done to occupy his time since he was a much younger man and how he managed to keep his identity concealed in so small a town.Still, this is a director whose future work I'm looking forward to.",Trick 'r Treat

I mean half the shots in the movie have about 165 pumpkins in the frame. & there are too many extras in the film running around trick or treating. it's supposed to be a small town it looks more like manhattan or tokyo for the crowding. it's like the writer kept going back saying ""I have another idea!"" and extras casting was going, ""oh look here's another person we can put in the movie!"" and the set designer ""I found another pumpkin!""also, there are about 10 villains oncscreen at any given time! it's all bit much! what bothered even more was stuff that characters did on screen to fake out the audience that made no sense within the scene. the sequences that offended most mightily were the backyard burial and subsequent pumpkin carving set up, the first of which was also a protracted instance of something played for laughs which prove unfortunately not to be forthcoming. (I also really didn't care for the sort of ""fat ass"" humor of the scene with the red haired kid that preceded these). Also the story with Rhonda and the bitch and gang and quarry certainly contains the best material in the movie. it's too bad that you end up asking yourself what they would have done for a victim if Rhonda hadn't ended up accidentally in their group. the one story that actually had no holes and made sense from start to finish was the one with the clearly somewhat ""off"" women. as for the ending... focusing on that guy and his vaguely iterated back story didn't exactly make for a glorious finish.I do appreciate the attempt to make an integrated ""omnibus"" type film, but. . . this wasn't quite the way to do it...",Trick 'r Treat

Instead of using cheap tricks to make us scared, Trick 'r Treat doesn't WANT to be labeled as a horror film, but a movie running through the veins of Halloween. Their is many stories that intertwine, following a Creepshow or Tales of the Crypt esque. The acting (very surprisingly) was actually quite good and real. Problem is, there was many moments where it lost its momentum soon after. To be exact, around the middle. I'm looking YOU werewolf transformation scene! Otherwise, this film is basically a Halloween treat and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. To be honest, this film would be better if you had a party with it or watched it with a couple of friends. It doesn't need no attention factor so you're set. All in all, if your expecting another ""Prom Night"" or ""The Unborn"" you're out of luck.

96,dschmeding,"Visually Stunning, yet totally ridiculous",3,3 October 2009,"First off... I always liked horror anthologies despite their mostly trashy flair in the old Creepshow vein. Trick'r'Treat seems to try the anthology thing with a new approach... first of all they dropped the trash, at least visually. The look of this movie is great, there are so many great moody shots and to see the girl with the red riding hood costume in the woods or the gardens with hundred of pumpkin head lights is pretty cool. Second they tried a new approach to the storytelling... the various horror plots are inter-weaved with time skips and referencing each other instead of telling a bunch of stories one after another.Now if you think this is a smart horror anthology you are wrong. Its not smart to use this story telling device if you use it to glue stories together that can not even be called ""stories"". The single themes are ridiculously stupid und shallow and most of all reminded me of one of those Halloween kids movies or the Simpsons Treehouse of Horror Spoofs. They are just built on clichés... you get zombies, werewolf-chicks, a little Halloween ghost who punishes those who break Halloween rules... all these things just happen. Except for the strange father who kills fat kids the movie lacks any kind of humor which saves most trashy anthologies. The problem is that Trick'r'treat takes itself too serious or rather tries to be cool.For example the werewolf-chick story is totally lame because basically you just see chicks in a wood turn into werewolves. It looks great but it has the feeling of a Marilyn Manson music video (even uses his ""Sweet dreams"" cover, so thats where i got the reference). It has not story development, no message... it just looks good and feels totally off. The other stories remind me of that ""Eerie Indiana"" TV series because they can only scare a 10year old and are told in a childish way. The Halloween ghost has some visually great moments but like all other stores leads nowhere . Its really not a smart idea to make a smart horror anthology and its a shame that the awesome visuals were wasted on a movie with so little substance.

SO MANY WAYS TO TAKE A LIFE. Hello Kiddies your pal the crypt-critic here,with a treat you'll love to watch on Halloween night. This is one of the greats and I heat there maybe a sequel and if so I'll see it,I hope it comes real soon. This independent horror film revolves around Four interwoven stories that occur on Halloween: An everyday high school principal has a secret life as a serial killer; a college virgin might have just met the one guy for her; a group of teenagers pull a mean prank; a woman who loathes the night has to contend with her holiday-obsessed husband. The plot is not realistic,it's like a scary tale you tell your group in a campfire. The tagline is a fun little rhyme to what the movie has to offer(well except for the poison part)it makes for a good one that suits the film. The movie is so original it's own unique thing celebrating horror and Halloween. The story flows well having it make connections to some of the four stories that all around to making them about by having characters meet or die by one another.The story unfolds with action of what's going with this individual and can make it out to look like a horror comic book which is pretty cool. The points of view is through characters and action,the characters each have their own tale and the action happens through the stories which is how it all flows nicely. The settings are very appropriate for a horror film,you got a lake,Halloween store,woods, and creepy houses. The settings do sustain the mood for the film and the music helps the film in some sequences. Trick 'R Treat has all the elements of any horror film,it has vampire and werewolves,killers,creepy story,great scares,some laughs and lots of fun. I totally recommend this for Halloween. I give Trick 'R Treat a four and a half out of five.",Trick 'r Treat

99,Mr_Censored,A Rate Treat.,9,10 February 2010,"Although horror films come and go throughout each and every year, there are very few that try and succeed at capturing the mood of the Halloween holiday. Not since John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece, ""Halloween,"" has the holiday been so beautifully captured and capitalized upon -- that is, up until now.""Trick r' Treat"" is a horror anthology much in the vein of Stephen King and George A. Romero's ""Creepshow"" and is the first film directed by Bryan Singer protégé Michael Dougherty. Based on a 1996 short-film/animation, ""Seasons Greetings,"" the film features the likes of Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Leslie Bibb and Dylan Baker in its cast. The story is split into five separate tales, all interweaving through one another and finally coming full circle in the end. Throughout the 83 minutes the film effortlessly conforms to, we are treated to a sick serial-killer/principal sharing his hobbies with his son, a group of horny young women preying on unsuspecting men who perhaps need a shaving (see: werewolves), a prank conceived by children gone terribly wrong, and a crotchety old man who finds his past demons coming back to haunt him.All five stories are connected not only by certain characters bumping into one another, but more importantly, by a mysterious trick or treater known only as Sam. With his burlap-bag mask and grimy pajamas, he manages to creep into each story to ensure that the Halloween tradition is kept with, punishing those who disrespect the holiday. Despite the fact that this character doesn't say anything and is given virtually no background, he manages to become an iconic force in the movie. His visage is one that is sure to be remembered for years, as the film gains its inevitable cult-status.For a first time director, Dougherty provokes quite some disturbing imagery, with the aid of some arresting cinematography and outlandish costume and set designs. There's plenty of atmosphere to go around, and amidst some of the black humor at play, the film never once loses its illusion. Whatever time of year you view this in, it will put you in the Halloween spirit, which is perhaps its only real goal. It's a shame that it got the shaft by Warner Brothers that it did. Had it been given a proper theatrical release, it likely would have had a larger impact on not only the genre, but the pop-culture landscape in general. Its direct-to-DVD dumping certainly doesn't do it justice, as even the most jaded of horror fans will find this to be a true treat.",Trick 'r Treat
100,RockPortReview,"Brilliant Horror Anthology, a must buy!",9,27 January 2011,"Trick 'r Treat 10/11/2010When John Carpenter's milestone horror film ""Halloween"" came out in 1978, it changed movies forever. Now every holiday has at least one horror movie made in its honor, from ""Mother's Day"", ""Thanks Killing"", and numerous Santa Slashers. Usually these movies were pretty bad, but Michael Dougherty's 2007 film ""Trick 'r Treat"" is a fun, scary, and enjoyable movie that is rarely made anymore. It's actually quite amazing that it was even released at all. It was shelved by Warner Brothers for over two years because of ""questionable content"" and other studio related politics. The way that it is made and in the context of the material it is a crime that it took so long to come out. It just became available on DVD and Blu-Ray last October. Trick 'r Treat is like an old comic book as displayed in the opening credits. It weaves together five scary stories on your average Halloween night. Each story focuses on how people of different ages experience the holiday. A great cast was assembled to bring these stories to life. Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Dylan Baker & Leslie Bibb all have fun roles and give great performances. Also appearing throughout the movie is ""Sam"" a seemingly little kid dressed up as a pumpkin who symbolize the terror and frightfulness of Halloween. Almost like a grim reaper, he makes sure all of holiday rituals are followed and punishes those who don't play along.Some of the reasons this movie took so long to be released is the number of kids that are offed. A bus load of special needs kids is purposely driven of a cliff and an elementary school principal moonlights as a serial killer. All of the Halloween stories and myths about the holiday really seem to ring true. Like ""A Christmas Story"" this is a movie that you can watch over and over every year.

CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FLBad things. Expectations!... More often than not, they turn around and bite you. TRICK 'r TREAT bit back hard! If ever I wanted to have an enjoyable genre movie experience, TRICK was it! A myriad of factors prevented me from doing so. At least viewers are spared from long-suffering, because after a scant 77 minutes, the end credits begin.Here is one very clear example of its myriad shortcomings: Toward the end, a neighbor, who is injured via a run in with a rather indescribable child monster, comes out of his empty home soon after with his right arm, shoulder and head ALL very tidily and professionally bandaged. (He must keep a live-in-nurse chained-up in the basement?!?) And how they managed to apply pristine white bandages without as much as a single drop of blood visible anywhere is nothing short of a miracle!Besides continuity issues, TRICK suffers from interminable other weaknesses. The only redeeming aspect of TRICK is its technical and visual excellence. Cinematography, editing, sets, set decoration, costumes, sound and sound effects, all exhibited levels considerably above average, albeit very clichéd and practically devoid of any originality.**** HUGE SPOILER CONUNDRUM Ahead! Read it and I'll bet 10 to 1 you'll say, ""O. K., Right! Don't want to see it!"" On the Other Hand.... Don't read it, go ahead and see the movie and you'll come back later and say, ""DAMN! Sure wish I had read Tony's SPOILER BEFORE! ""****What does TRICK consider to be its ""Trump card""? Apparently, killing off a bus-load of special needs kids! Oh, and just to be fair, so that they're not the ONLY kids singled out for an untimely end, other children are offed as well! Now I don't know about you, but I do think this is really scraping the bottom of the barrel! Is it incongruous to say, ""Well, at least these killings were done tastefully""?Writers and the director seemed to overlook the ""sometimes MORE is LESS"" factor, and, although the storyline is not linear, but rather circular, crammed in serial killers, vampires, werewolves, ghosts, zombies, a monster kid and a murderer-for-hire in several unrelated, and sometimes unresolved story threads in ONLY 77 minutes!

In an era of gross-out torture porn, there's something refreshingly innocent about a horror movie that revolves around creatively retelling old-fashioned ghost stories. Production values and performances are top notch--definitely the high-end of direct-to-video. While not particularly scary, it's consistently entertaining.",Trick 'r Treat
107,bayardhiler,Everything You Love About Halloween in One Film,10,24 January 2015,"Ah, Halloween. Other than Christmas, it is probably one of the most anticipated holidays of the year by both children and adults alike. Naturally, Hollywood has gotten into the act by producing scores of scary movies throughout the years. However, though a good number of these films have been set during Halloween, none have managed to capture everything about it quite like 2007's ""Trick'r Treat"". Written and directed by Michael Dougherty, it's a film that weaves together four interconnected stories, as well as elements of mystery, intrigue, and a childhood sense of spookiness. A young couple finds out what happens when you blow your jack'o latern out before midnight, a group of pretty ladies may not be what they seem, a pumpkin smashing bully learns the importance of checking your candy, a principle by day and serial killer by night discovers how easy it is to go from being the hunter to the hunted, a group of prankish kids realize it's not nice to play tricks with the dead, and an old scrooge discovers why you should always obey the rules of the season. Connecting these stories throughout the movie is a frequently sighted little guy wearing a simple cloth pumpkin mask and orange jumpsuit. As you can probably guess-and as the old man discovers at the end when he pulls the mask off-it isn't a kid under there at all, but something more darker and important to the tradition of Halloween itself.You can tell Michael Dougherty put his heart and soul into this and it clearly shows that everyone else did as well. Among the cast you will find the beautiful Anna Paquin as the seemingly innocent Red Riding Hood costumed Laurie, Dylan Baker as the ordinary looking principal/serial killer Steven (Does a worthy job of mixing in a little comedy with the macabre), Brian Cox as the Halloween hating hermit Mr. Kreeg, plus many, many more who should be congratulated for their work. As to the look and feel of the film, I can honestly say I felt like a kid on Halloween again. The decorations, the mood, atmosphere, musical score, costumes, everything comes together to make you truly believe it's Halloween, regardless of what time of year you're watching it. Even the inclusion of the urban ghost story that just about EVERY small town or community has adds great effect to the movie. I could go on but the less you know about the plot to the film, the better. Just know that ""Trick'r Treat"" is perhaps one of the best Halloween films you are bound to watch. In fact, as someone else on this site said, you could even say this film IS Halloween due to just how much the film captures about that ghoulish time of year. So set back folks, grab some candy, make sure the jack'o laterns are lit till midnight, and enjoy this worthy tribute to the macabre and magic of the season. And of course, Happy Halloween!!!!",Trick 'r Treat
108,WubsTheFadger,Trick 'r Treat,6,27 February 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the films story is an anthology which has various story's that intertwine in a very clever and smart way. The story's are not that scary but do have some dark humor that is often hilarious. Some of the story's are stronger then other while a few of the story's are a little weak. All in all, this film does a great job connecting all of the story's.The acting is all around good. Dylan Baker, Anna Paquin, and Leslie Bibb all perform well. Brain Cox gives the best performance near the end. He displays so much emotion ad is an understated talent.The pacing can be a little slow in some of the story's but it is mostly fast. the runtime is very short. the film is only one hour and twenty-two minutes.The gore and use of practical effects is great. I just wish that this film was scarier.Pros: Good use of the anthology system, connecting story's, good acting, Brain Cox's performance, good use of dark humor, and a short runtimeCons: Some weak story's, some weak acting, slow pacing in some story's, and the film is not that scaryOverall Rating: 6.3",Trick 'r Treat

110,tequila101,"Daunting Halloween Film high on a Scary Atmosphere, I Love IT!",9,19 April 2011,"I watched this hours ago and I already really like it a lot. This Halloween film brought the spirit of Halloween back into it's place. As this is some sort of Halloween film, I'm not going to go into comparing this to John Carpentar's, Rob Zombie's films or the others. This is a nice separate review I'm going to do.First off, the acting is really superb, the director/writer sure knew how to pick his actors and the atmosphere they bring is amazing to this film. They are brutal, cunning, daunting, scared, idiotic, smart at times and scary.I also like how intelligent this director is with the setting of pulling 4 stories into one film. It's good that there haven't been any sequels because they would be terrible. I'll talk about the stories though.Serial Killing Principal: I wish they could have taken this further though I liked the actor who played as the principal, very sadistic son of a b***h. Very nasty what a principal can do behind doors hey ;).Virgin Wolves: Even if I don't mind wolves this was the film's fall. This never worked out for me. It's also strange as the principal is drinking people's blood, being a vampire and then he starts being a victim pleading for help. It's a nasty scene which is good and I liked it but I can't understand how it works. Oh well it's awesome anyway ;).Demon vs. Old Man: I loved the fight between these two as we cut back moments earlier into the dread of an old man fighting for his life against an unknown demon kid who turns out to be a pumpkin demon. I also liked how this Demon kid popped out all over the place throughout the place. These scenes also showed how grateful and forgiving people are on Halloween or any other time.Dangerous, Horrific Kid's Prank: I believe this was my favorite. You could never tell if this was real or not. You just couldn't. A lot of mystery and disturbance as these kids were fooling around and then they actually end up getting disemboweled by the real zombie kids, back 30 years ago. Truly terrifying scenes.Trick r' Treat is a must see film for any horror fans of any age, especially the new generation who just watch crappy remakes like Black Christmas or The Hitcher.This horror film is one of the best modern horrors out there....I give it 8.8/10",Trick 'r Treat
111,quinnox-1,One good story not enough,6,25 November 2009,"I just watched this because I enjoy seeking out obscure horror movies. This is supposedly a cult classic movie but it doesn't live up to that billing. It has some funny black humor and is more of a comedy/horror, but with some unpleasant moments that probably should have been removed to make it more family friendly. Personally I don't think this movie would be appropriate for kids which is a shame, because it appeared to be heading in that direction but then they had to put in some 'shock' value moments, I guess to make it more appealing for horror fans.There are five stories all intertwined with each other. I think only one story is interesting and entertaining, the rest are mediocre. The best story is the one with the group of kids who for a Halloween night thrill go to an isolated lake in an abandoned quarry where a school bus accident happened. The child actors in this story were excellent and believable, and the spooky atmosphere generated was very good in this story. I also thought the ending of this episode was poetic justice, although a bit nasty and cold hearted.Other stories include a crotchety old man who hates Halloween, a young couple who are about to turn in for the night after a Halloween night out {this story is very brief}, a deranged school principle and his strange habits, and a group of pretty girls going to a rather unusual Halloween party. I didn't think any of the other stories were very good, although there is some good atmosphere throughout the movie.I rate it 6 out of 10 because I think the director's heart was in the right place and it is different enough to be worth watching, but not as good as its cult classic reputation.",Trick 'r Treat
112,Craig_McPherson,Like giving poisoned candy to a baby - only the baby wants more!,9,31 July 2009,"Just when it looked like the anthology movie was dead, along comes Director/Writer Michael Dougherty's Trick 'r Treat to not only breathe new life into this overlooked format, but also firmly establish itself as one of the best films to keep on the shelf and revisit each Halloween – if the folks at Warner Bros. ever decide to release it, either in theaters or to DVD.Selected to close out Montreal's 2009 Fantasia film fest, Trick 'r Treat spins five intertwined tales featuring an assortment of classic critters and creeps, with each interlocking story carrying its own ""Twilight Zone""-type twist. The single constant throughout is Sam (Quinn Lord), a mysterious diminutive munchkin dressed in a pajama jumper and sporting a burlap sack for a head with buttons for eyes, who appears briefly in each segment and takes center stage in the final story.Borrowing a visual style from the classic EC horror comics, Dougherty deploys vintage on-screen graphic call-outs like ""Later"" or ""Meanwhile"" to let the audience know which scenes are running in order, concurrently, or previously in the film's timeline, which comes full circle at its conclusion, ending where it began.With exquisite art direction by Tony Wohlgemuth and lush visuals by cinematographer Glenn MacPherson (2008's Rambo, Final Destination) the segments tell the tales of a young wife who can't wait to ditch the trappings of Halloween, even though the film's mythology says it's taboo to blow out a pumpkin before midnight; a sinister school principal and single dad with a nefarious agenda planned for trick-or-treaters; a young virgin nervously seeking her first time with her pack of girlfriends; a group of kids in quest of the truth behind a local urban legend; and an aging recluse with a tortured soul who finds his quiet Halloween night rudely interrupted by Sam.Dougherty, whose last major credit was as co-screenwriter of Superman Returns, invokes a spirit of childhood fun borne from hours spent burrowing through editions of EC Comics, Warren Publishing's Eerie and Creepy, and DC's House of Mystery to create a fun, rollicking ride that is rare in movies today.The sad aspect of this is that while Trick 'r Treat has been enjoying a positive response from the festival circuit, it's still a guess as to when this gem will be released. While the month of October would be a no-brainer, the movie was originally targeted for a 2007 release, only to see that get pushed back again and again. It's a shame for such a fine film to languish on the shelf, only to be seen by a select few at sympathetic festivals, for Trick 'r Treat is virtually an instant classic of the genre, even if its only audience exposure ends up being via direct-to-DVD.",Trick 'r Treat
113,TheMovieDoctorful,"The Single Most Overrated Film I Have Ever Seen, Little to No Redeeming Qualities",1,29 September 2018,"I want to make something perfectly clear before I start my review; I REALLY wanted to love this film. I love Halloween films, I love horror anthologies and I love werewolf movies. I was genuinely excited to see this, especially with how many of my friends had recommended it. I can honestly tell you that this is one of the most aggressively awful films I've ever watched. Trick r' Treat isn't half as original as it thinks it is. Every one of the abhorrent shorts in this film is predictable, cliched and derivative. Oh, the Principal is secretly a serial killer? Like I care. Zombie school children? Wow, that must have been really original back in 1980. Particularly eye-rolling is a segment involving teenage girls who are secretly werewolves. Not only has the ""monsterhood as an allegory for female coming-of-age"" concept been done far more intelligently and maturely in Ginger Snaps (And, later on, in both Jennifer's Body and When Animals Dream), the film thinks its audience are complete morons so practically every line of dialogue from the female werewolves is beating you over the head with not-subtle ""hints"" of their secret. (""Fresh meat"", ""I ate some bad Mexican"", did anybody ACTUALLY find these lines funny?) By the time we see Laurie literally wearing a Red Riding Hood costume, I could practically hear the noise of Michael Dougherty sniffing his own farts on what he incorrectly believed to be a subtle, original and unpredictable screenplay.But don't worry, because it's not just the screenplay that's obnoxious. The acting sucks too. Brian Cox and Dylan Baker are serviceable, I suppose, but there is literally not a single other performance that I would credit as even average. The kids and teens are unanimously bad, their incredibly forced delivery would get them laughed off a High School play. Particularly insufferable is Anna Paquin as Laurie. She's either overacting or underacting with nothing in between, and not in an entertaining way either. Every scene where we have to watch her painfully oversell her cringeworthy one liners (""What BIG EYES YOU HAVE!"") or not emote to anything around her was a chore to get through. No wonder this movie took me 3 times to actually finish.None of the characters are remotely likable or interesting. I understand that it's an anthology and character development is difficult to pull off in such short time. That being said, films like V/H/S 2 and Creepshow had no problem creating interesting or likable characters for me to root for and get invested in. No such luck in Trick r' Treat. Everyone is either a cartoonishly evil person for no god damn reason or blatant kill fodder. Who am I supposed to root for? Am I supposed to root for Rhonda, who thinks that slow, excruciating death is fair punishment for her peers performing a mean prank that they immediately apologized for? Am I supposed to root for the werewolves, a laughable attempt at ""feminist horror"" that ironically reeks of misogynistic fears of powerful, uncompromising and dominant sex positive women? Am I supposed to root for the serial killer principal who also sometimes dresses like a vampire when killing people? (Yeah, that happens in the movie too. Why? I have no idea. Doesn't really relate to any themes or bring anything to the character. Maybe it's to make the werewolf twist less obvious for the 2 people who didn't see it coming a mile away?) It's not even like they're unlikable-but-interesting, the only thing that makes them memorable is how irredeemable they all are. The film is neither funny nor scary. Trick r' Treat seems to think that merely being really childish (There's a joke early in the film about how Laurie's friend is setting her up with a date. She asks ""Is he young?"" as we discover her future date to be a middle aged man in a baby costume...Crickets) or really mean spirited (There's a joke in the film about mentally disabled children being driven off a cliff because their parents hate them. Lovely) automatically warrants laughs. This is a childish, nasty film that seems to revel in being sick and cruel for no actual reason and with no actual comedic payoff. As for the scares, the film uses a lot of practical effects, which I'm sure look great, but you can hardly see them with the god awful lighting and editing on display. It reminded me of the also-terrible Mimic; what's the point of great practical effects if your audience can't appreciate them?Trick r' Treat is garbage in every way. The acting is beyond horrendous, the stories are predictable, cliched and pretentious, the characters are awful in every way, the humor isn't funny, the tone is overly mean spirited, the scares are non-existent. What does this movie have going for it? A Halloween atmosphere? House of the Dead had a strong Halloween atmosphere too, it didn't make that film good. (Though it's still endlessly more entertaining and funny than this one...And far less pretentious to boot.) It's not just the most overrated film I've ever seen, it's one of the worst films I've seen period.",Trick 'r Treat

116,80sHorror,21st Century horror done in an 80s style,10,25 October 2015,"Apert from John carpenter's original ""Halloween"", this is this is my favourite holiday movie. Multiple stories are brilliantly woven together in true halloween spirit.Pleasant and Enjoyable. Perhaps not words you generally associate with a horror film. But then since when did every horror film have to gross out with gratituitous gore or scare senseless with slashing and stalking? To be fair calling this film a horror is quite misleading. Really it's a celebration of the various legends and imagery associated with the holiday. Watching the DVD featurette about the making of the film and the lore of Halloween should help people understand how to take this movie (clearly some reviewers didn't get it). Perhaps calling it a fictional documentary that toys with the themes and monsters of horror would be more appropriate? The only reason we have monsters here (and it's nice to be able to talk about monsters without solely referring to just Vampires or Zombies) is because it's All Hallow's Eve.Personally I liked that a non-linear approach was taken in telling the various tales on offer here as it sets it apart from the anthologies that came before it and which it would inevitably be compared to. The interweaving of the stories is preferable to having them stand alone as it's been done so many times before.The cinematography is top notch throughout and all those involved in shooting the film deserve hearty pats on the back, as do the actors and actresses. To a man (or woman) they all give good performances with a few excellent ones thrown in.I only saw one twist coming but then I constantly force myself not to start second guessing a film (What's the point?

118,thomvic,I wasn't scared but I was amused.,7,20 May 2011,"Halloween is a theme that has been overdone in horror films so I was thinking this was going to be tradition to those which have already done them - Halloween with Jamie Lee Curtis for one. I was expecting a slasher film where there is that character who is insane and has some shady past.Well, you get a bit of that and then you get a bit more too. For those who have seen the Grudge - the Japanese one - this story sort of follows in that tradition in that there is no main character and the events aren't really told in chronological order but more at a random sort of pace. It essentially has a few stories which some don't relate while some others relate lightly.What makes Trick R Treat interesting is that some of the twists in it are totally unexpected in the story lines which took my be surprise. In terms of it being scary - you won't get many nightmares from this because it is not done to scare you but more to keep your interest. You have the usual things in here - horny teenagers wanting a fling on the scariest night of the year, the annoying kids out for candy and then you've got the conventional child who is always got their face covered to hide their identity.This went straight to DVD apparently and to be honest I don't know if this would have had mass appeal for audiences to go see it. It did sometimes feel like a TV movie that wouldn't have gone out of place in an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But the narrative of the story lines are interesting enough to keep you intrigued especially when you know there are twists coming along with each story. But if you are expecting something really scary - this isn't where you should be looking for. It's more a slasher/short stories type film.",Trick 'r Treat

120,CountVladDracula,A pleasant surprise,10,31 October 2017,"So I finally saw the horror film that has been recommended to me for years. Trick 'r Treat. It had been described to me fairly well and I already had a feeling I would like Sam (A play on the spelling of Samhain, The literal spirit of Halloween) before it even started but it exceeded my expectations. I had seen parts of it before on things like Syfy, such as the segment with the stingy old man (who turned out to be a certain bus driver).I was pleasantly surprised. Sam is definitely on my list of favorite new classic monsters. Right up there with Freddy Krueger. It felt like a 1980s horror film (in a very good way). The effects were mostly practical and I noticed subtle homages like Rosaleen's version of the Red Riding Hood dress in The Company of Wolves. I really liked Trick 'r Treat. It's unique, creative, and yet familiar and in my opinion it's far more worthy of being a Halloween tradition than the Saw franchise.",Trick 'r Treat
121,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,An Underrated Horror Movie,7,28 June 2019,"Intro:
Trick 'r Treat is an anthology movie, and quite frankly, a damn good one. Meshing comedy and horror so seamlessly, and telling very entertaining and well-tied together stories taking place on Halloween. This is easily my favorite Halloween based movie, and possibly one of my favorite horror films.The Story & Characters:
The film tells four interconnected stories about murder and supernatural activity on one particular Halloween night. Not told in linear order, it's kind of fun to piece together the film, leaving the audience to think about the film, after watching it. And I loved every second of the hour and 22 minute run time. From an average high school principal who's a secret serial killer; to supernatural threats: this film takes horror and injects it with new life.I was very invested in the characters and the story when watching the film. As they can ranged from psychotic killers, supernatural beings, or even just normal people. Either way, they were always very entertaining to watch on screen.Both the comedic and horror elements really work. With some stories so over the top and ridiculous, and some were actually chilling to watch. The film knew when to be funny and when to be scary. All four stories were interesting to watch, kept my attention, and had a plot twist that I didn't see coming. Making it a movie I can watch over and over, not just for the horror, but for the narrative.The Visual Style:
I enjoy the style of this film, with the costumes, sets, and lighting: it really sets the tone and atmosphere of the film. Setting that it's Halloween. And making the film all the scarier.Conclusion:
I love this film. And it definitely deserves higher than 6.8 rating on this sight. Don't let the IMDb rating deceive you either, give it a watch and see for yourself. It's a film that I think everyone should. And a film like no other. It's one of my favorite anthologies, and favorite horror films. All I can say is, watch the movie.",Trick 'r Treat

123,eryui,"Update from the ""80, for the younger",8,26 March 2016,"Reviewers must not mistake the target. As this film is rated R because there is a bit of blood, a naked breast and a few dirty words, it is actually for a more experienced today very young audience. It is an Halloween tale after all.To adults could definitely remember the Creepshow's episodes of the ""80, as it look like to draws from those in its moderation, twists and way of telling.If you do not expect a horror for adults with very violent scenes or heartbreak scares, then for an audience of young teenagers is intriguing a little scary and undoubtedly well executed.My eleven old son enjoyed it and he was gripped till the end; as for me, I had some fun.I give it eight out of then not just because it is well done and it hit the target, but also to the humility of having released it just direct to DVD, while you can still see very worst and silliest horror movies in theaters.8/10",Trick 'r Treat
124,thelastblogontheleft,A Halloween classic,8,30 October 2017,"Trick 'r Treat, for such a well-known Halloween staple, had a surprisingly slow and stuttering start. Directed by Michael Dougherty, it was originally slated for an October 2007 theatrical release but got pushed back. It was screened at various film festivals between late 2007 and late 2009, including at the 2009 San Diego Comic Con, before it was officially released on video in October 2009.Honestly, it's hard for me to believe that this movie didn't have a theatrical release, but clearly the fans have picked it up and ran with it. Dougherty announced in 2009 that he is planning a sequel but it's been slow going. But, according to Bloody Disgusting, he's planning to dive back into production when he finishes up his current project, Godzilla: King of the Monsters.It's an extremely well done anthology, with all five stories centering around Halloween and the traditions surrounding it. There's a school principal who moonlights as a serial killer, a legend of a school bus massacre, beautiful women taking part in an interesting nighttime ritual, a grouchy neighbor who finds his home invaded, and a man trying to convince his wife of how awesome Halloween truly is.** SPOILERS! **I loved this collection, honestly a lot more than I thought I would. I realized that I had been avoiding this film for a long time. Something about it just struck me as cheesy, both because of the name and, truly, because of the character of Sam, the little scarecrow-like creature with the burlap sack over his head. (I still thought Sam was a little bit cheesy but after subsequently watching Dougherty's 1996 short film, Season's Greetings, I like him a lot more.)The stories are all woven together SO incredibly well. There are many instances of overlap — probably more than I even noticed on first viewing — that really tied the whole thing together. Too often horror anthologies are just a string of seemingly random short films, the only relation being the genre they belong to. But Dougherty paid attention to the most minute details things like having a werewolf howl in the distance in one short, and circling back around to it in a later story. The stories are happening at various points in the night, but it bounces between all of them, making the whole thing feel very cohesive.The film had the most nostalgic feeling to it for me — it really EMBODIES Halloween. It walks that fine line between being technically a horror movie but not actually being all that scary but not in the sense that it failed, more in the sense that it has the perfect air of the holiday to it, of the traditions surrounding it, of the legends and the lore. It's tough to describe, really, but it felt like childhood in a way. Despite all of the terrible things happening, I wanted to live in that small Ohio town — glowing jack-o-lanterns adorning each yard, a lively parade pulsing through downtown, costumes and candy everywhere. It had an extremely homey feeling to it. It brought me back to being a kid and whispering about urban legends or jumping at something rustling in a bush while trick or treating.Each story had a sort of cruel humor to the individual twists. There were times when it almost felt like a children's Halloween movie (in the best way) until you were abruptly reminded of how adult it really is (the girls partying in the woods stripping out of their ""sexy Cinderella"" and ""sexy Little Red Riding Hood"" costumes, for instance).The one scene that really did freak me out — that tapped into a sort of long-standing fear of mine — is when it briefly shows a woman making out with a masked man in an alleyway during the parade. He reveals his sharp fangs and winds up killing her and then just props up her lifeless body on the sidelines of the festivities where no one was the wiser. I think that's part of the reason that Halloween feels so dangerous, so electric, to me — when everyone's in a costume and everyone's striving to be as realistically scary as possible, people tend to overlook what would be horrifying in the light of day.And then there's Sam, the weird little kid made of stringy pumpkin pulp. I liked him tagging along to each story, being ever-present. It's amazing how recognizable he was even before I knew anything about the movie, really. But I especially liked how once he got his hands on a candy bar, he was good to go. Like dude, I FEEL THAT. You see the message written in blood all over Mr. Kreeg's bedroom — ""trick 'r treat, give me something good to eat"" — and you think it's some diabolical play on words, that he's actually looking to eat some flesh. Hellll no, kid just wants some CANDY. I appreciate that.Overall, a freaking great Halloween anthology. Is it going to scare the crap out of you? Likely not. But Halloween is as much about the nostalgia, the hearkening back to childhood fears, than jump scares or psychological thrills. Watch it!",Trick 'r Treat

129,manicman84,a truly remarkable horror film soon to be regarded as a Halloween classic,9,25 March 2010,"If there's one thing I will never understand about movie business is the policy of studios refusing to release such gems as Trick 'r Treat for years in favor of obviously lesser efforts. Unjustly shut down by Warner, Mike Dougherty's impressive feature debut follows a number of different characters during a single Halloween night. The four interweaving stories are marked by the presence of Sam, a creepy kid who wears an iconic mask and delivers his own brand of mayhem. Trick 'r Treat isn't centered on graphic violence being a recent fad. Instead, it uses skillfully built tension and gallons of black humor to scare viewers. With this approach, the movie resembles Creepshow and the greatest episodes of Tales from the Crypt. Every sinister aspect of Halloween is explored through lavishly detailed set pieces, marvelous costumes, highly stylized cinematography and wonderfully orchestrated music. Trick 'r Treat not only thrives on its Gothic production values, but is also deftly scripted giving way to trickery, pitch-black humor and unexpected twists of faith. It's visible that Daugherty superbly understands this kind of cinema as his direction never fails to be haunting. Overall, Trick 'r Treat is a truly remarkable horror film soon to be regarded as a Halloween classic.",Trick 'r Treat

131,Sunsphxsuns,TRICK 'r TREAT - THE WAY HORROR COMEDY FILMS USED TO BE,10,23 October 2018,"Trick 'r Treat (2007) is a surprising, unexpected, and pleasant return to the classic Halloween horror comedy movies of the past, (my past for sure) featuring a razor sharp emphasis on traditions and legends, the kind that sadly seem to be missing in much of today's horror film genre. Trick 'r Treat takes place on Halloween, and is presented in four stylized, intertwining horror stories. Michael Dougherty, who wrote and directed Trick 'r Treat, displays an extraordinary talent for goose-bump producing chills gently softened by thin layers of cerebral comedy. The audience gets to slowly discover how each segment is connected, ultimately presenting them with a complete film mosaic as opposed to four detached episodes.Trick 'r Treat moves quickly from one segment to the next, all expertly tied together by one exceptionally creepy yet iconic little guy named ""Sam."" Interestingly, the name of the sinister character, ""Sam,"" is derived from ""Samhain,"" taken from the ancient Celtic Festival of the Dead. This Pagan event eventually evolved into what we today call Halloween. And although not historically accurate, we can easily forgive Dougherty such artistic transgressions in this film or in Krampus (2015), a Christmas holiday thriller where a family's lack of ebullient Christmas spirit unleashes the unbridled horror of Krampus, a terrifying demonic force of ancient evil who's only other-worldly mission seems to be punishing human non-believers in a very big way!Dougherty is wonderful in helping his audience quickly recognize the ancient rules and principles of ""All Hallows Eve"" (Halloween), while simultaneously conjuring up several urban legends commonly associated with the dark holiday. It's all there: ""Check your candy to make sure it is safe to eat."" ""Don't smash or blow out the candles in Halloween Pumpkins,"" because if you do, you may sadly end up like poor Emma (Leslie Bibb). Let me say this: What happens to Emma isn't very pretty. And then there is ""Sam,"" like a silent ghost, a distillation of ancient and bloody rituals, quietly and carefully leading us through each story. He's oddly passive, that is, for the exception of Emma, and one other time when he spies cranky old Mr. Kreeg (Brian Cox) not offering candy to a group of children knocking on his door. You see? That is strictly against the rules of Halloween. ""Sam"" then pays miserly old Mr. Kreeg a visit. What happens next is . . . Well . . . You'll see.Trick 'r Treat is on my short list of Halloween films to watch. My list, not surprisingly, includes Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931), The Bride of Frankenstein (1935) and The Wolf Man (1935). These classic Universal films and a few others help remind me how the often riotous festival of Halloween actually looked like in the 60's.Trick 'r Treat is arguably a perfect film, practically flawless, and left me immediately craving a sequel. I've heard that Dougherty is indeed working on Trick 'r Treat 2, which, I hope will be released sometime soon. Please, Michael - don't make us wait any longer! We love your work! Lock the doors and windows, turn out the lights. Don't forget the popcorn, but then again, be careful not to eat too much. It might stifle your screams later on.",Trick 'r Treat
132,politehere,One of the Worst Horror Movies Ever,2,13 June 2014,"My God! What was this torturous piece of garbage I just watched?! No, calling this garbage would be an insult to garbage! I wish I had first read about this being an anthology and had realized that it was going to be a total waste of time rather than being ""tricked"" into watching it based on ""the misleadingly high IMDb rating"", which is the only thing scary about this movie! Was there a story somewhere I couldn't see?! I can't believe somebody on here actually compared this piece of junk to Drag Me to Hell, the absolute best horror movie with the absolute best story I've ever seen! No wonder nobody found that impossible review useful! I have to admit, the beginning credits did make me think of Drag Me to Hell, but that's all. As for the rest of the movie, the first few minutes were rather promising, and all of a sudden it turned into a complete joke. I wanted it to be serious, but it wasn't. The second story in the anthology was a comedy. Then it turned into a gore-less version of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", which made it quite lame and childish. I can't stress enough how lame and unscary stories about werewolves and vampires are, so the next story was an utter failure. The final story about a pumpkin-head killer was rather good, but it left me wanting more.The only reason I'm giving this movie a two rather than one is that I've actually seen much worse horror movies such as The Dark Fields, and because the acting and sets were great. The problem with this movie is that it has no story and after watching it you might want to see a psychiatrist to help you get this lame experience out of your head!",Trick 'r Treat
133,Tender-Flesh,Needs more teeth,7,24 May 2010,"The ratings system doesn't allow a 7.5 but that's what I'd give this out of 10.Trick r Treat is a good Halloween film dare I say to watch with the family? I think there is only one brief nudity shot which can easily be overlooked. Overall, it played like the best made Goosebumps ever. I didn't feel it was adult enough, and maybe that wasn't the market the director sought. I wouldn't even say it was scary, but it's very entertaining.I think the best aspect, besides Sam who I'll get to in a moment, is interweaving the stories and messing with the timeline of the narrative compared to other anthologies such as Creepshow where you have one story following another. Dylan Baker is great and I hope he gets more roles in horror. And I'm not sure what Brian Cox is doing in this, but he certainly gets his props, too.The overall story revolves around inter-related incidents that happen on Halloween night in a small town. Those who pay the price are people who defy the traditions of Halloween such as leaving Jackolanterns lit all night or giving out candy when children come to the door. And you get a bit of every thing most horror fans have some interest in: zombies, werewolves, and vampires. Throw serial killers on top of that and add a dash of an evil pint-sized roaming Halloween spirit, and you've got a goodie bag.You'll see a lot of things coming a mile away, once you realize how inter-related everything is. As for the effects, they are quite good, especially the werewolf sequence. Far too many werewolf films have characters growing hair instead of ripping off their human skin to reveal the wolf underneath. Nice touch. And, then there is little Sam, a character the director developed in an animated short in 1996. He's child sized, with a laughing child's voice, but sadly, when his flour sack mask is removed, much of the mystery goes with it and his ""real face"" was sort of a let down.It's too bad they had such a problem getting this to theaters. They release a lot of movies that are vastly inferior so I can't see what the holdup was. Regardless, the success of the film festivals and word of mouth have done well for the rental world and there is a sequel on its way. I hope the director sticks with the same time-shifting narrative, and my only real suggestion is to make it a little nastier this time, brutality-wise.",Trick 'r Treat
134,Kirollos-Noah,A Great Halloween-Movie!,9,20 October 2019,"Halloween is coming, and the Halloween marathon is coming too.. and it's time to watch lots and lots of horror movies, and get our pumpkins ready! Happy Halloween, everybody.. and welcome to my review of Trick 'r Treat.Trick 'r Treat is a straight-to-DVD movie, which was released in 2007, and it was written and directed by Michael Dougherty. And starring Dylan Baker, Anna Paquin, Brian Cox and lots and lots of many other actors.And it's about five interwoven stories that occur on Halloween: An everyday high school principal has a secret life as a serial killer; a college virgin might have just met the guy for her; a group of teenagers pull a mean prank; a woman who loathes the night has to contend with her holiday-obsessed husband; and a mean old man meets his match with a demonic, supernatural trick-or-treater.Trick 'r Treat is massively underrated, maybe that's because it wasn't released in theaters, but still, it could've found its audiences behind all of that, but unfortunately not a lot of people do know this movie.Trick 'r Treat is directed in a Tarantino-Style of direction, and that could be a flaw, because it's very similar to Tarantino's movies, and after a while it gets annoying because of how Dougherty directed this movie... It's not like this movie isn't its own movie, but its similarity to Tarantino's movie is pretty obvious and after a while it gets really annoying!
This movie is constructed of 5 different stories that are somehow connected, and that connection CAN be revealed towards the end, and the movie is going back and forth between what happened earlier and what happened later, and from a story to another just like how Tarantino directed all of his movie! Some people won't even notice, or won't even get bothered, but it's so noticeable. And again, this movie is still its own movie, so if you don't care about the similarities between some movies and the others, you won't get bothered or annoyed at all.Each story -as I said- is connected in a way or another, and a couple of them has a pretty good twist in it, the structure is pretty well-made, and that what made us care about the characters very much, and what made this movie really really works is that it used the Halloween-myths and combined them together in a twisty way!The main character of this movie, the demonic kid in all the posters of the movie, is pretty scary, he's in every story, even if he didn't do much, but he was there, and his presence throughout the movie gave it a creepy atmosphere, and that was pretty well-handed, and towards the end, he changes the way you think of why the movie was named ""Trick 'r Treat"".All the performances were really good, the script is so well-made, you could just quote some of the lines, mostly from Steven Wilkins played by Dylan Baker, his character is what gave this movie a good sense of dark-humor, which made him my favorite character in the movie, along side with that demonic kid, though that kid didn't have much screenplay, but, as I said, his presence made the movie so scary, and it built a great tension til the climax, and I guess that was pretty well-handed!All the five stories are great, the school bus story is very sad and disturbing, though it wasn't graphic, the girls' twisty story was really cool and well-made, and of course Mr. Kreeg's final story is my favorite!Trick 'r Treat is a great Halloween-movie, it was really well-handed and made, though its similarity to Tarantino's movies was annoying.. this movie is still really underrated!I'm gonna give Trick 'r Treat an A!Happy Halloween, guys, it's getting close, I'll be reviewing a lot of horror and Halloween movies a lot til the end of October, so stick right here if you liked this review!

I just wanted an entertaining, spooky Halloween flick with maybe a little dark comedy. Well that's exactly what I got. There are basically four tales of horror intertwined and told from different view points through out the film 🎞. Some are a little predictable while others have twists that will definitely surprise you. There's some gore for the gruesome fans but it's not done to the point it is just smut. The nudity is not over the top but there are some nice shots. And yes there's profanity, stuff you would cuss too if you saw some of the things in that movie IRL! I thought the acting and directing was done rather well. SPOILER ALERT :🚨 The only thing I had a problem with is that they never truly explained the psychopath school principal and his son's motives or backgrounds.

Talk about digging a 10-foot hole and realising you can't get out, before accidentally releasing the pins out of the four grenades strapped around your waist and then shooting yourself in your, soon to be in a million-bits, foot with a double-barrel shotgun. Yes Warner Brothers, you made one HELL of a fatal mistake by not releasing this film sooner! Despite the film's minuscule running time of around eighty-minutes, opening with a brief scene in which we are introduced to the dangers of blowing a jack-o-lantern out before the end of the night, we are treated to four scary Halloween stories; a school Principle (Dylan Baker) who has a killer after-school activity; a teenager dressed as Little Red Riding Hood (Anna Paquin) who is stalked through the woods; a group of school-kids who find a local urban legend as all too real; and a irritable, grumpy old hermit (Brian Cox) who finds that some trick 'r treaters want more than just candy. Oh and there's Sam, a mysterious character who wears a burlap pumpkin mask and mysteriously turns up at one point during every story, and I will tell you now that under that mask isn't the face of a warm, cuddly bunny rabbit, unfortunately...Each story is infused with energetic performances from all the lead cast members, while instances of suspense followed by a brief splattering of dark-humour send your emotions on a hugely enjoyable roller-coaster; you'll be cowering one minute and laughing out loud the next! However the real splendour and genius in Dougherty's film is in the beautifully shot and composed sequences, shot by cinematographer Glen MacPherson, which bring alive the tradition of Halloween that we all remember from being a child. We don't remember Halloween being a time about serial killer's with an agenda, or people being mutilated for no apparent reason, but the traditions, the costumes, the customs, the legends, asking for candy and sweets, being told to watch out for the 'bogeyman' by your parents, and generally walking the streets dressed as something else, something horrible, something ghoulish on the one night of the year where you could literally be anybody or anything else. With the only visible flaw in my opinion being the incredibly short run-time, just as you've strapped yourself in and are thoroughly enjoying the ride, it ends abruptly and leaves you wanting more, much more.It's fun, it's exciting, it's suspenseful, it's scary and it is the perfect movie to watch on a dark, cold and windy all Hallows Eve night, unlike the common repetitive Hollywood-ised drudgery such as 'Saw 6'.",Trick 'r Treat

Your best choice for a Halloween movie this year!,8,12 October 2009,"Every holiday season, there are a great number of films relevant to the holidays that pretend to pass of as THE movie event of the season; there's the endless battery of romantic comedies on Valentine's day, the Christmas-themed movies on December, the horror films of Halloween, etc. Very (and I mean very) few can even barely pass of as consumerism and a feeble attempt to make the most out of movie-goers' wallets, but every so often comes a film that truly takes into its purpose to transmit and portray the true spirit of the season. Such an example is Michael Dougherty's recent DVD release of ""Trick 'r Treat"", a Halloween release that's destined to become an absolute cult classic.The film follows four interwoven tales: a deranged and deeply disturbed school principal (Dylan Baker) who gains pleasure from killing children and making jack-o-lanterns out of their heads with the help of his own child; a twenty-two year old virgin (Anna Paquin) who seeks the perfect Halloween screw for the first time in her life; a geeky young girl (Rochelle Aytes) who joins her school classmates on a terribly naughty prank; and a sick and lonely old man (Brian Cox) who's haunted by an age-old secret. These four tales weave into what I consider to be the ultimate Halloween movie experience, immersing the viewer into the true spirit of the season, and capturing on screen (with an ample gamma of horror-film clichés, all of them aptly used) the fiendish feeling of terror a night of trick-or-treating in a usually quiet town can affect over us.The interesting point of this film is the fact that it overuses (yes, OVERuses) movie clichés, Halloween lore, ideas and plot twists from other films...and still manages to be refreshing and exorbitantly amusing from beginning to end. From the first scene in the film, even before the main credits start, we experience a feeling of déjà vu, and we prepare ourselves for yet another Halloween-based thriller with little or nothing at all to offer. By the time the movie has ended, you know that you've witnessed something truly special and especially entertaining that, while lacking in the emotional depth and masterful production a remarkable film usually has, manages to transmit the meaning and traditional incentive of the holiday. This is supposed to be a horror film, but it seldom scares you; rather, it opts for showing in a beautiful and artistic way, the feeling Halloween transmits. I consider it to be a seriously accurate and socio-culturally acute representation of everything Halloween means, and even though it's a film meant for adult audiences, it appeals to the mind and sensitivities of all ages and all cultures that accept and promote Halloween.The fact that it holds no surprises and that it often fails to scare doesn't take credit away from it. You'll notice, scene after scene, how meticulously every detail has been constructed, how the production design, the costumes, and the wonderful score (composed by Douglas Pipes, who seems to have been born to score films of this genre) all aid to the mood and the tone, how it involves us and keeps us interested even when we know what's going to happen. The clichés and overused scare material are not the film's flaws, but its style; it compiles scare material from previous films and from common Halloween experiences to provide a thoroughly entertaining experience that, as I've said before, will become a holiday classic that families world-wide will share and marvel at.I'm aghast at the fact that this film has been shelved for over a year and has been finally released on DVD only. I can't understand how the Warner Bros. executives could deem the film to be unimpressive, when it has so much to offer. In a time when horror thrillers have become as monotonous and boring as they come, this film freshens-up the genre and proposes new ideas and points of view on already existing ones. There is no originality of plot, directing or production, but there is something greater: the promise of an accurate, empathic and entertaining portrayal of an entire culture, society and tradition. A film doesn't become memorable because of how good its technical elements are, but from what we learn and experience from it. This film promises and delivers nothing but the above.Don't get me wrong; this isn't the best film of the year, it isn't even the best horror feature I've seen. But it is an enlightening, charming and highly recommendable video experience. Put it at the top of your list of Halloween screenings.Rating: 3 stars out of 4!",Trick 'r Treat

143,moviesmaniax,Warner Bros. made a huge mistake for not releasing this in cinema // instagram: moviesmaniax,9,19 February 2015,"An anthology horror/comedy film with four brilliantly twisted tales that feature an iconic and season favorite character, Sam. With its smart, unpredictable, and gleefully twisted script and favorable villain, there is no wonder why this quickly becomes fans' favorite Halloween film and one of the best anthology horror films ever made. The GORES here are pretty inventive and humorous as well the SCARE that's mildly creepy enough. All of which leads to a great wrapped up climax and overall a undeniable FUN twisted film that will be remembered for a long time and proves Warner Bros. a huge mistake for not releasing this in cinema in the first place. >>A-<<",Trick 'r Treat
144,FilmFreak94,An Interesting Anthology,7,31 October 2012,"Trick 'r Treat is four stories woven together one Halloween night. It follows a murdering principal, a group of young women going to a party, some kids visiting the site of a terrible accident, and an old shut in who hates Halloween and has a dark secret. The tales are not told chronologically and are connected by a small boy in a strange pumpkin costume with a burlap sack for a mask.The first tale is that of principal Steven, who murders as a hobby. His most recent one is incredibly difficult to hide as he must keep his son quiet and avoid suspicion from his neighbor, Mr. Kreeg. But when his son finally gets on his last nerve, will he be his father's next victim?The second tale follows a group of kids supposedly collecting pumpkins for Unicef. Their real intent is to visit the site where a school bus containing special needs children crashed into a rock quarry. A slightly different girl named Rhonda joins them and when they arrive the ringleader of the gang, Macy, retells the tale of how the bus crashed there. The bus driver was payed by the children's parents to get rid of them by driving the bus into the quarry. They are warned not to disturb the water in the quarry as it might unleash the spirits of the dead children. As it turns out this might be more true than they hoped.The third tale is of a group of young women from out of town who are going to a party. They coax several local boys to be their dates for the evening. The youngest of the group, Laurie, is a self conscience virgin who awkwardly tries to find a date around town but has no luck. She is unaware that someone has already taken a shine to her, and is now following her waiting for the right moment.The last story is that of Mr. Kreeg. A grumpy old man who despises Halloween. He scares children from his house and refuses to give out any of the candy he has. But when he gets a surprise visit from a boy in a strange costume and burlap sack he learns what happens when you don't obey the rules of All Hallow's Eve. Each of the stories are told in a brilliant fashion. They mislead you cleverly with how the story will end and present an entirely different, and sometimes terrifying, conclusion. The film is rife with plenty of scares, dark humor, and suspense that makes the film a fun watch for the Halloween spirit.",Trick 'r Treat
145,georgia_cushion,Happy Halloween.,8,28 June 2011,"I wasn't sure what to expect before watching this film. But it didn't disappoint. I thought that it had a good story-line and the way all the stories fit together was very clever. There were also a lot of good actors, Anna Paquin was the best in my opinion. I thought that unlike most other films it wasn't over-the-top gore, but the bit where that boy was coughing up blood made me feel super queasy. The only thing I would say is don't go expecting it to be scary, or you will be disappointed. Overall I thought that Trick 'r Treat is a good film with a good story-line and actors. I would rate it 8/10 and say that it is suitable for mature people 13+.",Trick 'r Treat
146,dean2900,Do Not Believe the Good Reviews * *NO Spoilers**,3,26 September 2009,"This movie was originally scheduled to be released in 2007 but test screening went bad. The writer of this movie also had penned the Superman Returns reboot which had bombed badly. The studio realized the movie is very bad and dropped it.The only reason I am spending time posting is because of this continued trend of studio plans and viral marketing. It is real simple, the studio buys some critic reviews and compares it to John Carpenters Halloween (which is a joke) and then at the time of this review out of 800 votes, over 600 of the people rated the movie 10/10. That does not even happen with the Godfather, Shawshank, LOTR, and other top movies of all time.The movie was so bad that the studio buried it. They are now going all out to try and sell this movie before REAL REVIEWS are made of the movie and word of mouth explains how bad it is.There are no scares, no laughs, no tense moments, very little blood/gore, no T&A, etc. I don't mind it lacking the last three as long as it is a good movie but this is not.I cant imagine who would like this. It felt closest to a knockoff of Tales from the Darkside the Movie without the real book ends and without decent special effects, some minor scares, etc. In fact, it was basically plot less and not tied together neatly. It was lazy writing.You have been warned.",Trick 'r Treat
147,id247,"A wasted opportunity, should of been better",5,18 August 2012,"I can't fault the visual style of Trick 'r Treat, it really captures the essence of Halloween in the USA. It also has Dylan Baker, Anna Paquin and the legend that is Brian Cox, so three big plusses there.So what makes this anthology film such a dog's dinner, a movie of missed opportunities? I think it's because the narrative is such a mess, oh don't get me wrong, there's some genuine fun and gruesome moments to be had, I love the conclusion to the Anna Paquin storyline (nice twist) and the pumpkin monster in Brian Cox's house is terrific, but overall it's like looking at a jigsaw puzzle with a lot of pieces in the wrong place.I don't have a problem with films where scenes are out of sequence, the jumping of timelines, but even when pieces are out of order there has to be a certain logic to their disorder (if that makes any sense!) and here's it's a mess, even when the parts do all click into place by the end. Perhaps it's also the editing of the film in terms of sequencing that is not right.Plus the pacing is poor at times, the school bus in the quarry lake segment could of lost several minutes easily, and was also the weakest story of the film, despite being pivotal to the conclusion.If you want to see a film that's a really good example of a narrative with fragmented segments coming together perfectly, I recommend Greg Marcks 11.14, which has an excellent ensemble cast including Hilary Swank, Patrick Swayze, Ben Foster, Henry Thomas and Barbara Hershey.I love anthology films and really wanted to like Trick 'r Treat, but I'm afraid this one let me down. 5/10",Trick 'r Treat
148,Verona,"In the minority, apparently.",5,29 August 2012,"Im not the type to jump on IMDb and write reviews, but when I have questions or a movie seems to ""bother"" me, I feel I must. I must be in the minority to not have been blown away by this movie. All through it, I found myself saying ""why are all these people here?"". Brian Cox, wooden Anna Paquin, Tehmoh Penikett- why are they here? The first two seem to be recruits from the X-Men series, also directed/produced by Bryan Singer. The others seem to be people who thought it would be a fun project- fair enough.I can see why this movie was shelved for a few years- its not something that would've drawn in tons of theater audiences. By its very name, its something that should/usually has starting actors and a few gallons of red corn syrup. And usually when a movie IS shelved, its not a good sign.Now the ""comic book"" horror anthology"" style has been done before- Creepshow, for instance, which this movie reminded me of in several parts (ie the zombie children). But it didn't make any sense here. Besides having people walk by, in the background et al, there wasn't really anything that tied these stories together. They Weren't part of a comic book series like Creepshow and adding in ""Earlier"" and the credits in comic book font doesn't make it so! Also the ""hot chicks that are really something else"" was almost a direct rip off of the Tales from the Crypt episode ""House of Horror"". The ""rite of passage"" part was kind of cool, but what do we get then for this ""turn the tables"" piece of female empowerment? A bunch of sorority bunnies stripping and having the camera zoom in on their breasts.The pacing of this movie was tedious- I understand the building up of tension, but then why start off in a hardcore way? Was it just to be a typical horror movie type ""beginning""? I also agree with another reviewer- the ""Halloween"" rules were not especially set down. They actually killed and mutilated someone because she blew out her jack'o'lantern? If Halloween is now a grisly gut-cutting festival, why have that Rhonda explain about the original origins? The zombie children sketch was something else that puzzled me. I understood it all, but then I kept waiting for something else to happen, like the zombies to come into town or something. But no, they can defy time, space, death and submersion, but a simple elevator keeps them down below.Sigh. It wasn't awful, but its not something Id watch again. It was simply boring and nothing new for the genre.",Trick 'r Treat
149,ToxicJug,Awesome anthology horror!,7,20 December 2020,"Trick r Treat is an extremely fun and well thought out anthology style horror. The way that the filmmakers managed to play out multiple different storylines at a time while effortlessly connecting them all together throughout is impressive to say the least. To say that this film is unique would be the biggest understatement which is no easy task, especially within the horror genre. Speaking of task that can prove to be a bit difficult, Trick r Treat manages to successfully be both scary and funny at the same time making it a film that you can sit down and enjoy even if horror isn't necessarily your preferred genre.",Trick 'r Treat
150,frank-liesenborgs,Trick or treat 2?,8,1 November 2021,"Did some digging in good Halloween movies and found a couple. Hence I watched ""Trick 'r Treat"" and was very positively surprised. But the biggest surprise was that there is apparently a sequel in the making. Cannot wait now after seeing this one.This is the incarnation of everything you need to know about Halloween, including respecting the rules: Always hand out candy to trick-or-treaters, always wear a costume, never blow out a Jack O' Lantern before midnight, always respect the Dead and the most important always check your candy!This movie is spooky, funny and the perfect film to get you in the spirit of Halloween. The movie stars Dylan Baker, Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Leslie Bibb and many more good actors (male and female of course) and their acting is just perfect for this movie. No over-acting detected, all in line with their characters. The plot and plot twist at the end is one that will make you craving for more. A very exciting, creepy, thrilling and at the same time sarcastic and funny movie. Even after Halloween I would recommend to see this movie. A hidden gem! Waiting for the sequel now.",Trick 'r Treat
151,c_p_c,"Scores big on atmosphere, but lacking in story development.",5,3 October 2009,"This film has been at the top of many ""To See"" lists for the past few years, including mine. It appeared with a rockin' trailer, but also with the stigma that no studio would release it. Word from the festivals was positive, but many of us were waiting on pins and needles to see it for ourselves. Verdicts will be coming in over the week and it will be interesting to see people's reactions to the film.There is no doubt Dougherty has created an atmospheric ode to Halloween. The film is visually astounding and reeks of Halloween in every sense: the costumes, sets with smog and more jack-o-lanterns than you can count. The film's score, provided by Douglas Pipes, is eerily fun and provides a fantastic supplement to the mood Dougherty has created with all his visual elements. It should be an addition to any collection of film scores. The film is worth a look for these reasons alone.The acting is on par with what the film demanded. The film has no star, and each actor or actress is only featured for a relatively short time. In that respect, each performer handled their material aptly.However, where the film suffers is not from the story subjects, but their execution. The stingy 82 minute runtime is the crippling factor. The film's mythology supposes there are rules that must be followed during Halloween to survive the night. They are not all explicitly stated, and to be honest, I only can recall two of them: Always keep a jack-lantern lit for safety from the spirit world, and check your candy. Each story revolves around characters who break these rules and are punished by the child-like, pumpkin-headed ""spirit of Halloween."" This is a fine setup for a horror film, and indeed, Dougherty had great ideas, but they are not fully developed in the final product thanks to the film's length. Dougherty attempts to stuff too many elements into the film's hour and 20 minutes. As such, characters are never fully understood, the script's organization is sloppy and while some tales are more fleshed out than others, every tale leaves the viewer wanting and expecting more. Although Dougherty concludes each story, the viewer is left with a good handful of questions that seem key to buying into all the events that occurred. An extra 20 minutes would have filled in these gaps and made the film one to remember. Although we may never know, I would be curious to find out if there was more story left on the cutting room floor.It is clear to me why this film never got a theatrical release. The overall story is just not strong enough. Without the viral and internet marketing accumulating over the years, this film would not have a wide appeal, and likely been a box office disaster. I must give credit to Dougherty for trying to put something different and original out there, and in many ways he succeeded. However, the film falls short in telling its stories, which makes everything else just sweetener at the bottom of an empty glass.A creative, atmospheric, and original film that ultimately cuts itself short due to underdevelopment of its stories, I give ""Trick 'r Treat"" a 5/10.",Trick 'r Treat
152,spotlightne,It probably deserves its IMDb rating,7,19 February 2010,"I read both great and bad reviews for Trick 'R' Treat before watching the movie.But it was the bad reviews that stuck in my mind. Was it THAT bad? Well, not in my view after watching the entire film, there is no way it's awful. I gave it a 7 mark, mainly because it's both watchable and different.There are supposed to be four or five stories here, but there seemed to be more than that. The story of the serial killer seems to melt away after a few minutes, yet the werewolf and the school bus tales seem to hang around for much longer. I'm sure there was a vampire in this as well but he seemed to just stroll by! Now I come to think about it, he must have been part of the werewolf story! One of the reasons why so many people hate Trick 'R' Treat is because there doesn't seem to be a clear start and end to the individual stories. They merge into each other, to the point where characters from one story appear in other stories.The movie is well shot, colourful and memorable. Okay I accept it's not for everyone but hey what film is? There are few real twists except for the werewolf story which caught me out. I never guessed that coming! All in all, disregard the bad reviews and watch the film yourself. Make your own mind up. You might be pleasantly surprised.",Trick 'r Treat

It's a smart horror without forced disgusting scenes that will try to replace lack of script and any meaning which is quite often direction taken in horror genre. But note that the film has disturbing scary scenes. It will also make you laugh on occasions but it is not a horror comedy.Beside the fact that the separated stories are put together in original manner and meet in one spot in the end without leaving holes in the plot other great thing about this movie are the twists, which are totally unexpected.But it is just too short; it ends too soon and ends in the middle of all the fun.

156,Jim-D,The BEST Halloween-themed movie ever made,10,9 June 2009,"Before anyone cries foul over my statement that TRICK 'R TREAT is the single best Halloween-themed movie ever made, allow me to back up the statement. While 1978's HALLOWEEN is a masterful, amazing thriller that truly has no equal in the horror genre, TRICK 'R TREAT is something wonderfully different. Its a movie that IS Halloween.Whereas Carpenter's classic is set during the holiday and it plays heavily into the plot, the film could (arguably) be set on any other night and be just as frightening. TRICK 'R TREAT hinges completely on All Hallow's Eve, taking every spooky childhood memory its viewers have about the holiday and mashing them into a gleeful, creepy anthology of tales that are somehow both genuinely chilling and nostalgically beautiful.Try as I might, I cannot think of a film more deserving of a 10/10 rating than TRICK 'R TREAT. Writer/director Michael Dougherty has crafted a film that transformed me into a five-year-old child in a Dracula cape and plastic fangs, riveted in stunned horror as his vision played out before me. Somehow, it succeeds in being both terrifying and charming, like a dark old painting that still reminds you of home.TRICK 'R TREAT's story unfolds unlike a traditional anthology picture, with all of the movie's separate plots taking place together. We're not subjected to title cards or stunted intermissions between tales, but a seamless mix of Halloween hijinx and horrors. In its five overlapping stories, a couple discovers what happens when they blow out a jack o' lantern before midnight, a bullying child learns to check his candy before eating it, a young woman is stalked by a hooded stranger at a harvest festival, a group of pranksters uncover the ghoulish truth about a local urban legend, and an elderly Scrooge is visited by a pint-sized hellion who is far more interested in tricks than treats.Buffeted by wonderful performances from Oscar winner Anna Paquin, Emmy winner Brian Cox, Dylan Baker, Leslie Bibb, and Battlestar Galactica's Tahmoh Penikett, TRICK 'R TREAT is the one and only genre film to have been released in the past decade that is already one of my all-time favorites.When its done, you'll feel sorry for the works of Tim Burton and Quentin Tarantino, because TRICK 'R TREAT has taken the best of these auteurs, blended them with ten pounds of candy corn and razor blades, and shoveled the whole mess down your throat.TRICK 'R TREAT may not just be the best Halloween-themed movie ever made, but the finest example of horror cinema in decades.",Trick 'r Treat
157,Vastarien202,Perfectly Creepy!,10,27 September 2009,"I can't believe that WB would just sit on this film! I saw it last night and was thrilled to be doing so, after waiting for it for two years. The style is a dead-on homage to classic 80's films Creepshow 1&2, while maintaining its own uniqueness. The effects are spot-on, the settings are gorgeous, and the costuming is excellent. The acting is no slouch either, and I loved the cameo by the ""Bad Santa"" kid in story 2. The film takes place over Halloween night, and is slit into four stories which interlock in unexpected ways. As mentioned before, each one has a creepy twist, and I won't spoil them here. This is an instant classic, and deserves to be seen by as many people as possible. I for one can't wait to own it, if it ever becomes possible. Remember kids, always check your candy!",Trick 'r Treat

Ghosts, werewolves, vampires, serial killers, zombies, costumes, candies, friends, party and rock&roll. The small stories put together to make the movie are surprisingly good, a bit makes me remember of Tales from the Crypt. This is how we see horror when we are kids. What is the message?

I have seen thousands of horror films and T'r T is undoubtedly one of the best films I have ever seen. From the moment it started I got the feeling I was going to like it, you can tell it had a fair amount of money chucked it's way, the set looks fantastic. This is going straight to DVD in October, with no theatrical run (it was made in 2007)...Unbelievable! From the acting to the effects to the direction - the whole thing is just masterful.The film itself basically is set on Halloween, and a bunch of stories interweave into one in a very clever way, it is sort of like the CREEPSHOW films but each story is'nt standalone, they are all going on at the same time and come together at the end. I did'nt know to much when I went into it, and I think it's the best way because there are a bundle of great surprises littered throughout!

165,IAN-Cinemaniac,I Want To Love This Weak Treat,6,28 October 2009,"I'm one of the many that has been dying to see TRICK'R TREAT since first reading about a few years back. I love Halloween, the holiday and as an avid horror fanatic I adore the film HALLOWEEN as well. So I pre-ordered the Blu-ray of Trick'R Treat the moment it was listed on amazon.A couple of weeks ago my Blu-ray arrived in the mailbox. I raced upstairs and threw it in the player. I watched it. I loved the look and feel of this lovingly made throwback to 80's genre films such as The Thing, The Goonies, ET, Monster Squad and of course John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN. TRICK'r TREAT wants to be everything and suffers for that. There is very little character development or backstory. There is no one to route for and no one to hate. It's too short and too rushed to take time on anything except the aesthetics, which look great. This film is like a cute girl with nothing on the inside. She'd be perfect if only she had a brain too.Needless to say I'm disappointed. Sure I would have liked to have been scared but I understand it's difficult to execute a good scare, but at least one quick jump would have been nice. I do like Trick''r Treat for what it tries and wants to be, but for what it is I'm left hanging, waiting for my anticipation to be fulfilled with looks and brains. A bunch of well lit jack'o'lanterns do not a perfect film make.I now understand why TRICK'r TREAT never got its day at the cinema.

167,IMDBer100575,Very decent movie,8,15 October 2009,"I watched this movie because it had Anna Paquin. And though her role was pretty minor, it wasn't disappointing. I liked that she turned out to be something you didn't expected (well, I for one, did not expect).I was quite impressed that this movie actually showed or at least implied that children were killed. You don't see that in horror movies (or any genre) too often. Even in the Friday the 13th series, you don't see pre-teen kids get killed (obviously, slasher flicks show teens get killed all the time but even Jason didn't kill the little campers in Part VI).I also enjoyed the way this movie skipped around chronologically. If you've seen Memento and enjoyed how the story unfolds bits and pieces at a time, each time going back further, you'd like this movie too. And it comes full circle at the end. Nothing special, no twists, just a good ol' fun ending.** 10/29/2009 4:13 AM - I changed my rating from 6 stars to 8 stars. I really enjoyed this movie and have watched it again a few times. Best part of the film is the Sweet Dreams sequence...log off of WoW, even if Alliance is winning WSG, pick up your pipe, and watch this movie! **",Trick 'r Treat

170,Poptart_Psycho,Treated Indeed,6,4 November 2015,"Micheal Doherty brings us a well presented anthology horror, 5 interlinked stories that happen within the same street on the same Halloween night. Like most underrated movies this went below the radar. I don't know why its very carefully done and linked together Anna Paquin plays a great part.First Part: A high school principle has a secret life as a serial killer, you see him pray on victims throughout the night.Second Part: A 22 year old college virgin played by Anna Paquin is out with her sister and friends, believing she has found the right guy (happens to be the principle) the girls take them into the woods in some bizarre unpredictable cult scene.Third Part: A group of teenagers who you see trick or treating at the beginning play a prank on another local girl about a bus that crashed into a lake killing all the kids. But unfortunately for them the prank backfired Forth Part: We see a grumpy old neighbour of the principle whos always angry is welcomed by a demonic trick or treater trying to kill him.And lastly a woman whos had enough of her season obsessed husband.Trick R Treat isn't overly scary neither has a lot of jump scares but its well executed with unexpected twists worth a watch",Trick 'r Treat

172,TransAtlantyk,More people need to see this fine pulp-style horror anthology.,8,11 January 2012,"This film is the perfect example of the failings of the studio system. This is a truly world-class horror film that deserved a full theatrical release with a decent marketing campaign. The film has still managed to get itself a decent reputation and is growing in popularity but from the beginning it should have been treated with more respect.This is the Halloween film to beat. I'm a Carpenter faithful however this film encapsulates everything that horror and Halloween fans appreciate about the season and the holiday. The atmosphere is dripping with the trappings of Halloween. It is not scary nor is it meant to be scary, it is very much in the style of Creepshow or Tales from the Crypt though I find is superior to both, especially Creepshow.In my reviews I don't like to discuss particulars about the films, just enough to get a feel as to whether to you should view a film or not. If you like the Halloween season, campy horror films, John Carpenter, and in general the creepy autumn mood - watch this and I guarantee you will not regret it.",Trick 'r Treat

It's in the great tradition of those really spooky Horror anthology films that Amicus Films did so well in the 60's & 70's and reminds one of such classic TV shows and movies like TALES FROM THE CRYPT, CREEPSHOW & TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE. The film has four Halloween themed stories that are interwoven on one Halloween night with a mysterious masked ""kid"" named Sam linked with the stories. Great performances by Brian Peck and Anna Paquin and a very ghoulish sense of humor together with the scares. It's a real pity that Warner Bros. changed it's mind & gave up on this film just before it was supposed to be released in theaters last Halloween and has not even released this very good and well directed & scripted film either in theaters or on DVD. Halloween and horror fans should seek out this movie if Warner Bros does decide to release it on DVD or theaters.

174,baileygiannini,A TREAT THIS IS,9,30 June 2018,"If you love horror films, this is the one to watch. This one is off the chart scary and terrifying. This horror picture is somewhat wacky, but in a good way. It's a trillion times better than Rob Zombie's two original horror films, House Of 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects. Both of those films are pathetic in their own ways. This film however, is dark and creepy. There is blood, but the filmmakers knew when to use the blood and when to leave certain horrors to the audiences' imaginations. This is very important for horror films. As in doing so, I don't understand why this film got mixed reviews. I know everyone has their own opinion, but to me, if you're a die hard horror fan, you'll love this one. Amazing storyline and good acting by everyone. It also stars Dylan Baker who played Dr. Connors in Spider-Man 2 and 3. He does a great job. I give my compliments to Michael Dougherty for creating this great horror film for us horror fans. Everyone who loves horror pictures should enjoy this film.

177,drunkenhopfrog,Brilliant American Halloween Classic,9,27 September 2009,"Well, welly, well. After years of hearing about it and finally giving up hope to see it, a sort of Providence intervened and an unexpected last minute trip later netted me a screening of once thought to be DOA flick, ""Trick r Treat."" The tragedies that almost fell to keep this movie from being seen are too numerous to explain. One quick fact may lead to some idea of its rocky road: The original release date was to be October 5 2007 – two years before its actual release date this year. It was a rough road and a long wait for those of us that got wind of the movie early on.The structure of ""Trick r Treat"" is similar to Creepshow or Twilght Zone: The Movie. There are five intertwining stories shown out of chronological order – each dealing with a rule of Halloween. The rules are familiar modern Halloween mythology: Wear a costume; Always check your candy; Never blow out a jack o' lantern; Hand out treats. One of the stories presents two rule failures while another seems to not deal with the rules at all. It would not be fair to describe any of the stories in detail. There is no real mystery, but part of the immense fun of the film is to watch as each story unfolds without knowing what is going to happen. The stories include tributes to some of our most popular Halloween entities such as vampires, werewolves, ghosts, serial killers, creepy town legends, and supernatural monsters. Some of these favorites don't play quite like one would expect and the movie has enough surprises and misdirects to keep each of piece of this Halloween tradition montage fresh and extraordinary fun.Anna Paquin from the X-Men movies and HBO's True Blood is probably the most familiar face in the movie. Her story, as each of the stories in the movie, is excellent, however fans of her ""True Blood"" series may take particular delight.Overall the movie plays in the right key with each element. The parts and the sum are each meticulously crafted without a single sour note and builds up to a fantastic movie. There has never been a Halloween movie similar to this in that ""Trick r Treat' panders exclusively to the Halloween experience specifically in the United States. Each story and theme are from our experiences out of childhood and the fear of what lurks in the dark, what's waiting in alley, or if it were true, what would happen? The cinematography and pacing of the movie are both superb. At only 82 minutes the stories build and conclude with a tight narrative evocative of tense fear and expectation that whatever happens next is going to happen fast. The film uses a dark canvas but plays around with rich saturated colors. The effect reminds one of the bright and colorful pageantry of Halloween and the richness of our memories of being young and excited and scared.It appears that the fate of ""Trick r Treat"" is sealed. It is not going to get wide theatrical distribution and will only be playing at a handful more film festivals. But if anything is right in our pop culture, this movie will live on indefinitely in DVD rentals and purchases. The movie is absolutely destined to be a mainstay in DVD players across our land during the Halloween season or anytime that one wants a fun jolt and journey back to when we could be scared and those magical – scary – wonderful things of which we are frightened.www.popbunker.net @drunken_hopfrog @popbunker",Trick 'r Treat

News and reviews.... And want to keep up to date on upcoming horror films that are coming to the theater. So in 2007 I was pumped for trick r treat..... Wait 2007... yes you are reading that right ....2 yrs... I know 2 f**king years and I have finally seen trick r treat and the fact that this film is going straight to DVD October 6, 2009 Is really a shame.... Please all horror fans and genre film fans buy trick r treat... this is Wrong turn 2 straight to DVD quality.... The acting, Music, and production are top notch.... And 1 word can be used to describe this film and that's Fun.The film is played out in 5 different stories a-la Creepshow... And Each story does have a twist a-la Tales from the Crypt... What makes trick r treat special for me is it's such a celebration of October and Halloween... Like trick r treat was written by a group of people setting around a campfire telling scary stories... It has that feeling to it...Characters from one story will bump into characters from another story.. but when that happens it feels natural the story is never forced....I don't understand how this film never got a wide release but Paul Blart Mall Cop is the number 1 movie in America this year at one time... jeez.... Anyway my favorite of the stories is about a cantankerous old hermit (Brian Cox), visited by a strange trick-or-treater with a few bones to pick. That strange trick-or-treater is the one constant in all 5 stories and serves almost like a punishment for breaking Halloween rules... Don't smash or blow out a pumpkin when this little guy's around... Who knew a sucker could be that dangerous.....So on Oct 6th 2009 please either pick your copy of Trick r Treat up, or order it on On-Demand PPV, to show Warner Brothers a movie like this deserves a wide release..

180,myrothe,Surprisingly Excellent,10,3 October 2009,"I went into this not knowing what to expect. I must admit I liked the concept as well as the subject itself (I am a huge fan of Halloween. I was born October 13th and have always LOVED the holiday for some reason. Ever since I was a child. More than Christmas by far.)I liked the anthology style, and i also loved the Pulp Fictionesque flash backs and forewords, and the interconnectedness of the stories. Honestly I liked all of the stories equally save for the first one, and that was only because of the short length. it almost reminded me of something like Simpsons Treehouse of Horror for adults, with a dash of The Goonies sprinkled with a liberal dose of gore.Which brings me to what I really liked the best about this movie, it was fun.What I mean by that is it seemed to hearken back to the fun 80's horror flicks (like Evil Dead, the Return of The Living Dead series, House 2, Dead Alive, etc...) where they would mix in humor, frights, and gore all in equal liberal doses. I really get into that type of horror. Shaun of The Dead is a prime example, a brilliant movie in my opinion. as well as Slither. Even feast was fun (albeit stupid)It seems like lately there has been a glut of me-too, Saw wannabe, grimy, gritty, Se7en-esque torture films, and similarly creepy, atmospheric Ring wannabes. Basiclly anything that currently is selling well, is suddenly duplicated ad nauseum. Those indeed have their place, but enough is enough.Variety is the spice of life and I was really happy to find this little gem. Already ordered both the Blu-ray version and DVD.Not sure what all of the haters on here were expecting when they watched this movie, but I think some horror fans have gotten a bit jaded.Not everything needs to be compared to Halloween. Sometimes its nice to just kick back, with a lack of airs, and enjoy it for the bloody good movie it is, and not expect every movie to reinvent the wheel.",Trick 'r Treat

182,dan_marsala,Made by Children for the Adulthood,8,1 November 2009,"In vespers of the northamerican festive day, Halloween, I've decided to take a look at this movie, from which I knew looking on to Anna Paquin's profile and the advice of a good partner.From the beginning, the movie don't seem to be different from the new-age-horror-films, (drunk beauties that later will be murdered; wild kids that don't believe in ghost; human beings who dress like monsters to scare the people), but there's something else that the rest of the movies have already lost: an unpredictable drama.The movie is divided in four stories, a lot of different characters, but they're exquisitely bounded in one pretty town addicted to Halloween. Really nice bounded, if you ask me (though my big brother hate it).Also, you'll find out that this is unlikely an horror film. From the right side, this is only a union of four terrifying stories, the kind of stories the children tell in front of a camp fire or, yes, in the night of Hallowen. Obviously, this isn't a kid's movie (because of the nude scenes and the extreme violence), but the script was clearly written inspired in children tales...not very common children tales, but they're extremely at the Hallowen-style. I think people will love it by itself, but I don't want to know about another ""Big Brother"", so I'll recommend this:1) Yesterday was the best occasion to watch it, but if you didn't, just wait till the night; turn off the lights; call all your friends older then 8 but younger than 18 (avoid your father and mother, and take your girlfriend if you like) and don't close your eyes in the scary scenes...or you can always wait till the next Halloween, but I doubt you will.2)Remember: you'll watch a bloody version of movies like ""Hocus Pocus"" or ""The Witches"". Do not expect an horror film like the ""Bloody Valentine"" or ""Final Destination""s. A funny movie, indeed.",Trick 'r Treat
183,robertrosado,A guaranteed classic of the horror genre.,10,27 September 2009,"As a self-proclaimed connoisseur of the horror genre, I can safely say that I (along with legions of fellow fans) have waited in AGONY for two years over the release of Michael Dougherty's debut feature.But, despite strong feedback from test screenings and film festivals, one had to wonder... What was keeping Warner Bros. from releasing the film? I mean, the theaters have been flooded with remakes and sequels and ""Saw"" movies consistently, and could ""Trick 'r Treat"" really not compete with them? And, even if the movie WAS released, would it live up to the hype that Warners had involuntarily created? Well, the movie has finally arrived to us... and it is a beast. A delicious, twisted, gleeful anthology, with the the four plot lines seamlessly interwoven. Connecting them all is the instantly iconic figure of Sam. This little guy, wearing nothing more than a scarecrow costume and a potato sack over his head, is the stuff nightmares are made of. For my money, he is Halloween's answer to Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny.The screenplay is fresh and surprising, the pace is brisk, the tone is morbidly charming, and the cast is remarkably solid (Dylan Baker and Brian Cox are standouts). The film also features the kind of immaculate detail and thick autumnal atmosphere that any fan of cinema would appreciate, let alone the horror genre.On top of that, the movie is scary. Really. Not in a deep, troubling ""The Exorcist"" way, but is reminiscent of the friendly shiver you get when being told a ghost story around a campfire. Doughterty's affection (obsession?) for the holiday is apparent in every last frame, with pumpkins, candy, shadows, foliage, and costumes being beautifully incorporated into the film's overall mood.Mischief, mayhem, and gore are all over this cracked-out little gem, guaranteed to be a classic of the horror genre, not to mention an addition to my annual list of required viewing for October 31st.",Trick 'r Treat

There are all going on at the same time. My favorite part is just when you think you know how it's going there's a twist. It's different than you typical Halloween movie (your Jason and Freddy) which makes this fun. The way it circles around reminds me of some of my favorite Japanese and Korean horror films.

For the first time in a long time, I had actually been spooked by a film! Hearkening back to the days when films made being scared fun and not sheer torture, ""Trick 'r Treat"" is an anthology film, telling several interconnected stories that all occur on the same Halloween night in the same town. However, this film doesn't just take place on that special night; it effectively exploits it, drawing on the natural fears of such a celebration and warping the traditions associated with it in profound ways. Combined, the four (or some might say five) tales are expertly-crafted to work both as standalone features and as a single creation.Read My Full Review Exclusively At: www.thecinemaview.blogspot.com",Trick 'r Treat
186,jephiachantharath,Quintessential horror classic,9,17 September 2013,"Trick r treat may at first seem like an average horror movie with barely any shock value and bad acting, but to my joyous surprise I was wrong. This movie goes back to the horror anthology style; much like creepshow, and does so pretty well. Binding 4 tales into one somewhat woven story, I say somewhat because the film doesn't execute the links in the perfect manner. What it gets right though is does great, and here what's they do right. First off set up a lore of an iconic character: Sam. Sam is based off the Samwhein, the spirit of Halloween, and is displayed as a child with a pumpkin head wearing a mask. They setup clear rules like the horror clichés: 1. participate in giving out candy, 2. Keep the jack-o- lanterns lit all night, and 3. Don't smash any pumpkins. It's fun to have these guidelines and just watch the characters break them and we know what'll happen because of it.The selection of characters are good, not entirely great, but for the most part they all do okay. The best section in the movie is with Dylan Bakers character because he does a good job at portraying a serial killer in a silly manner. The worst part is the section with the Zombie children because the child actors range from okay to bad. Then there's the happy medium with the werewolf tale and the final chapter with Sam, where the acting is balanced.So overall, this is definitely a must watch during the Halloween season, and I enjoy watching it even when it's not Halloween.",Trick 'r Treat

These movies are usually quite stupid, but I like them anyway. This would be a nice thing, if it was a nice move - but it isn't.There's no scary moments, no laughs, no nothing. Just some very silly non-entertaining stories. This isn't a movie for adults, and kids wouldn't like it either. It's quite obvious the good reviews were manufactured by the studio - maybe some director's relative and so on.

189,jew_59,"I saw it, and I liked it.",7,5 October 2009,"Not the scariest horror movie, but I thought it was pretty entertaining. As you see from other comments, this is an anthology movie with four stories happening on a particular Hallowe'en Night in small town Ohio. Unlike other anthologies, the stories are interrelated, and the entire action happens in one evening, with the basic moral, don't mess with Hallowe'en. Everybody that does, comes to a bad end.I found all four stories pretty fun to watch. If you like gore, it's not for you. If you like edge of your seat suspense, again it's not for you.On the other hand, it did have some pretty effective chills, and I really enjoyed it. I recommend this, I guess it didn't preview so well, so it went straight to video.

It borrows from many other films and stories and while some might scream ""rip-off"" I didn't feel like that at all. Think of it as more of a goody- bag where you have small bits of all your favourites.The cinematography is fantastic and the way that all the stories are tied together works really well. The fact that you get to see some scenes played out twice but from different perspectives was a very clever way of making you feel like you were right there in the middle of all the ""festivities"".With ""Trick 'r Treat"" what you see is what you get - no trying-to-be-clever plot twists, no deep message. This is a throwback to ""Tales of the crypt"" type horror where you might not be scared but you're excited nonetheless.By no means is this the best film ever made but it knows what its purpose is and it serves it very well.

They mixed in a quality intertwining story with some funny goofy horror elements. The burlap bag kid was classic and Ill always remember him cause it was just so unique. They could also move onto a sequel as well cause they left a lot of the characters there to move forward. I thought it was a lot of fun to watch and enjoyed the hour and a half of watch time.

196,masakiuma,An amazing horror compilation,10,23 June 2010,"Trick 'r Treat is a horror compilation movie, similar to the style of Creepshow and Tales from the Crypt. It tells four interwoven stories all set on the same night of Halloween: 1) A murderous school principal continues a crazy tradition with his son 2) A group of kids, eager to scare an outsider with a town urban legend, get the tables turned 3) Pressured by her friends, a virgin looks for her ""first,"" but things are not as they appear 4) A Halloween Scrooge is attacked by a vicious supernatural trick-or-treaterI bought this movie spontaneously without reading any reviews or knowing anything about it...something I almost never do. I was not disappointed.On an initial surface-level viewing, Trick 'r Treat is a fun experience. However, where it truly shines is slightly below the surface. One of the coolest aspects of this film is all the ""hidden"" things to find. It isn't exactly hard to understand, but there are enough ambiguities that one can theorize about certain events. Also, on a second viewing it is very interesting to see characters you may not have noticed before be around at certain times...hence the ""interwoven"" adjective in the synopsis. It's hard to explain, but you get the idea.The cast isn't exactly triple-A, but they aren't unknowns either. It was weird to see Anna Paquin again after watching two seasons of True Blood and having her not talking with a southern accent. Most of the music is original score and fits very well with the atmosphere of the film. There are a few licensed songs, but for the most part they are appropriate where they show up.It's really hard to review this movie because I can't explain most of the things I really liked about it without massive spoilers.A cult classic in the making, this is probably the best Halloween-based movie I have ever seen, and I will definitely be busting this out next October 31st and each one thereafter.Final Score - 9.5/10",Trick 'r Treat

Instead I'd like to call to memory a little movie that came out in the 80's called 'The Monster Squad'. Great movie right? It sure was...when I was 6. 'Trick 'r Treat' really does fall into the exact same ""grey zone"" if you will. Sure there's boobs, cursing, and violence but nothing overtly adult is really happening in this comic book influenced film. Over half the characters are under 16 as well. In it's defense it's beautifully shot. Any viewer can see no expense was spared to give us the writer/director's vision...and it's a really cool vision. The exact kind of vision and story I loved when I was 6 and 7. So please, if you're over at least 13 know that there won't be any scares to be had and that your love of movies such as 'Creepshow', and 'The Monster Squad' will be acknowledged.",Trick 'r Treat
199,WatermelonJones,Anthology Horror Film with Perfect Blend of Horror and Humor,6,5 October 2021,Its scary. Its funny. Its not heavy on the plot but thats because it is an anthology film so they pay-off is not so much the result of any harrowing reveals or twist. The humor is good for a horror film as I often find the genres level of humor to be campy and on the nose but thats not so here. I genuinely laughed at points. I was never scared but the story telling made the whole thing worthwhile. Additionally one of the stories acheives a genuine sense of emotion and pathos which often seems to go missing in genres as dry and self-reflexive as horror.,Trick 'r Treat
200,cblazo,A Halloween must!,10,14 February 2016,"What an awesome movie. I loved everything about it. I think this movie truly captures Halloween. The streets are adorned with jack-o lanterns, hanging ghosts and ghouls,orange lights and other spooky decorations. The kids fill the streets with their chatter and laughter. All the while being overseen by the creepy, little character of Sam. There are 5 intertwined stories that come to a head at the end. The film's score was dark and fitting which I thought was among the best. The characters of the film were spot on. Dylan Baker (Steven) was so good. I think he is an underrated actor with great abilities. Both Brian Cox and Anna Paquin were great as well. Both characters were involved with some neat plot twists. There are werewolves,a serial killer, ghosts of dead children and a pumpkin-headed protector of Halloween. I think Michael Dougherty wrote and directed a perfect Halloween movie that should be a tradition. I know I watch it every Halloween night right along with the father of Halloween movies. John Carpenter's Halloween. They are two different movies, but they both capture and portray that wonderfully, frightful night!",Trick 'r Treat

I only wanted to watch this movie because i love Anna Panquin but i got so bored and UN-impressed by this movie I turned it off after the scene with Anna Panquin. This movie is filmed like a movie from 1970 not 2007 and who ever wrote this needs to seriously get it together.I would never watch this movie again nor would I suggest it for any one to watch.Total waste of time.

The trailer made it seem like a typical horror slasher film. I saw it because I enjoy clichéd horror movies, they are still good. But this was NOT one of those movies. Trick 'r Treat was the revival of Halloween horror films. It was funny, it was creepy, it was gory, it was sexy, it was a brilliant Halloween film. My theory is that this was the unreleased version of Halloween 3. You know a good one. It had a brilliant amount of blood in it and a brilliant amount of suspense. This movie actually managed to creep me out. It was also very well crafted and towards the end you realize things you didn't at first. Things that interlink all four stories. A good thing about this film was also the fact that it was enjoyable. Sometimes a film like the 2010 A Nightmare on Elm Street has so many jump scares it gets boring and ruins the movie. This movie had a fair amount but kept the movie enjoyable.For extra chills watch this film on Halloween.",Trick 'r Treat

The chronology of the movie reminded me of 'Pulp Fiction' in the way it was told in non-sequential order. In fact the first scene and the last scene are one in the same, which is an exact duplicate of Pulp Fiction's structure. This is an inspired way to intertwine the four stories, but the draw back is that I didn't develop much interest in the stories that were being told.None of the stories really produced any suspense or chills (although the story of the children returning to the site of the school bus crash is at least atmospheric) and none the characters were interesting either. And my biggest complaint is with the last story which totally wastes the talents of Brian Cox.Ultimately, it seems that the film-makers should have focused more on fine tuning the quality of the four stories rather than trying to tell them stylistically.",Trick 'r Treat

This movie doesn't even deserve a 1.This movie was obviously written by someone who's never written a scary moment in a movie. All the director could think about when writing this movie was boobs, sex, and children watching sex.This movie is laughable, 30 minutes of this movie could be easily cut for wasted time.

207,oecobius,completely weak,1,26 January 2011,"I heard a lot of hype about this being the most creative and fun halloween movie in a long time, but the movie doesn't stand up to the hype one bit. There's nothing creative about it--the stories are predictable and uninteresting with zero depth, and the characters are all one-dimensional. There is no satisfaction for sitting through the film. The filmmakers realize there's absolutely no point to the stories and throw in some cheap tit shots as a last-ditch effort to keep their audience interested. People can say what they will about how this movie ""captures the spirit of halloween"", but that halloween-ish tone basically comes from the cheap, obvious ""spooky"" suspense-builders that the movie uses instead of interesting characterization or themes. If you want a clever or even interesting movie, you'll be disappointed in this thing.",Trick 'r Treat
208,russellt-766-50076,"It may not be the scariest movie ever,but it sure was entertaining",8,15 June 2010,"This was a very entertaining film thanks to its clever story and fairly unique style. And it was very nice to see that for once things like acting and character development where considered important in a horror movie. It had its fair share of surprises and was nice enough to refrain from what I like to call ""false""scares. The four stories here were smartly interwoven yet mostly independent from each other. The film is also fairly shocking but I liked that fact that it didn't resort to the grisly violence of the ""Saw"" movies or the extreme gore seen in some of the new horror movie like Friday the 13th or Halloween.To be honest this isn't the scariest film I have ever seen. To be frank in some ways I feel that not all it's potential was reached. One thing I noted was that was that one or two scenes were a bit to well lit. I am not going to give any spoilers away but in my opinion the less you see of something the scarier it is. I wont say when this flaw is evident but if you watch this movie,which you should,you will probably spot the scene I am talking about.But to be fair there isn't that much to gripe about here. The film has its fair share of scares and surprise and the flaws are minimal. All in all this was a smart and very entertaining horror movie and one I would easily recommend.",Trick 'r Treat

210,rucipi,One of the most boring horror flicks ever,1,16 August 2015,"Seeing all the praise and positive reviews this film has, we decided to watch it tonight. 30 minutes into the movie, we were still expecting SOMETHING to happen. But the whole script was just pieces of unbelievable characters strung together.No one has any connection to another, yet the writers tried to make it look like all the protagonists were linked. My biggest issue : it did NOT make any sense at all! No explanation whatsoever as to who is who, why some people have superpowers, no character development, incredible. The color palette was really dark, but the movie was not. For a horror flick, not one second will you be scared. There is no tension. It's just a teenager direct to DVD piece of trash you should never see. I have rarely been so bored in my life.",Trick 'r Treat
211,pushfrog_2000,A fun little Halloween movie,9,15 March 2010,"Not to be taken seriously, this movie follows the same theme as Tales from the Crypt, Twilight Zone or Goosebumps. It presents five little vignettes that both contain their own tale, and interlink to create the overall story of one unfortunate night. The movie is not perfect, but it is one of the best Halloween movies I've seen. Many people may not ""get"" this movie, because you have to watch this movie as it was intended: as an urban legend. Despite the fact that it does benefit from multiple viewings -- they leave dubious amounts of nods to big surprises scattered throughout -- this movie is not more than what is offered: characters often have no back-story, no direction for the future, and no explanation. They simply do the things they do, and move on with their lives. There is no hidden meaning, or moral of the story. The truth is that the movie is simply about the spirit of Halloween with ghouls and creatures of all kinds coming out to, as an in-movie news reporter put it, ""be the scariest thing they can imagine."" For that, I highly recommend it.",Trick 'r Treat
212,Llakor,Clever Inter-twining of Stories Elevates this Horror Anthology,8,3 August 2009,"Trick 'r Treat is a new take on the horror anthology genre. It tips its hat to EC Comics' Tales From The Crypt with its comic-book montage opening credit sequence and with its caption boxes ""Later"" ""Earlier"" and ""Meanwhile"", but there is a sense in which the film seems inspired more by films that were inspired by EC like Creepshow than by the original comics themselves.You might think that in being an homage to an homage that there would be the danger of being like a blurred photocopy of a photocopy, but instead the distance from the original material allows Trick 'r Treat to take risks and become something completely original.The danger with anthologies whether in film, books or comic books is that one story will be so strong that it overshadows the rest of the collection (and conversely one so weak that it ruins the whole collection). Writer and director Michael Dougherty neatly avoids this dilemma by interweaving all the separate stories together. The film cuts back and forth in space and time from one story to another with characters from one story bumping into characters from another.The most common element in all of the stories is a small scarecrow figure called Sam, but all of the stories have some connection with other stories. The connections are so strong that in reviews, people talk about four stories, but I count at least six: the couple returning home from the Hallowe'en parade, the school principal (Dylan Baker) with a ghoulish secret, the virgin (Anna Paquin) looking for a Hallowe'en date, the kids playing a prank on an autistic girl, the story of the school bus crash told by the pranksters and the grouchy old man (Brian Cox) dealing with a home invasion.Because all of the characters intertwine with one story or another, the film ends up quite accidentally dealing with one of the favourite themes of Tales From The Crypt: the hierarchy of monsters. The Cryptkeeper (and his fans) were always fascinated by wondering whether monsters had a food chain and if so, who was the apex predator. Or to put it another way, at what point do monsters become victims of other monsters? The success of the Saw franchise seems to have doomed this film to a direct to DVD release which is a real shame. It is a spooky, creepy and inventive reminder of why we love the Hallowe'en season and the many superstitions that we have evolved to keep us safe from the monsters that go bump in the night",Trick 'r Treat
213,cookiechip_07,A Halloween Treat,7,29 June 2011,"Trick r Treat (directed by Michael Dougherty) is set in the small suburb of Warren Valley, Ohio and over the course of one Halloween night a series of sinister events occur from the different viewpoints of the local neighbourhood.The great aspect of the film is the way the story has been shot and told to the audience. In the fashion of an anthology of short stories, we begin with one couple who have been parting and then come home, only for a few minutes later the 1st of many ""Halloween"" happenings to hit our screen. As soon as Henry tells Emma not to blow out the Jack –o- Lantern because it's against tradition but she does so anyway... we know there is trouble ahead! Once we see the resulting outcome of this 'rule breaking' we do not find out any more, but go back to moments earlier in the evening and enter a new tale from a different member of the publics position. This happens again and again, the story being told in a reverse but in doing so unravelling the mysteries, facts and strange happenings in a small town on the spookiest night of the year.The film is an original so gains brownie points for being so. The unique 'evil' main character that I like to refer to as 'sack boy' (aka Sam) is unsettling at best. When possessed it is very creepy and makes for a cool new baddie rivalling 'Chucky' from Childs Play. Included in the fray, are the other traditional Halloween characters, from vampires to werewolves, psychopaths to zombies and they all play there part nicely, but I believe the real power of this film lies solely on 'sack boy'. Turn him (it) a bit more 'demonic' unlocking the full potential, then not only does Sam become a huge cult figure but the movie itself would have all the ingredients to ensure a hit franchise.Trick r Treat has the ability to be interesting and tense throughout but the main problem I found with it was that it lacked in the scare department. Having said that, finding films that are not all about the gore these days is welcoming and if you could only inject a few big 'boo' moments into Trick r Treat, then I believe this film would have received a lot more main stream attention and subsequent success. As a result, we have a straight to DVD movie, which in turn will possibly lead to it developing a cult following through fans of 'Halloween history' and as far as genre classing goes, i would call this as a light horror rather than a full blown one, which in essence is enjoyable for all to watch.Overall all the credit must go to Michael Dougherty for producing a slick Halloween treat. With factual writing, he has covered every detail and aspect of Halloween legends which makes for a refreshing tribute and innovative take on the genre.",Trick 'r Treat
214,cokezero99,Perfectly fitting for Halloween,10,18 October 2016,"This film is THE Halloween film. I don't care about the other film which is actually called Halloween.Basically this story takes place in a generic American town where it is Halloween. Throughout the film we follow 5 different stories that intersect at times (for example there's a scene where characters from story A bump into characters from story B) but they basically have nothing to do with each other. Adding to this things are not always in chronological order. This may sound like it's overwritten and confusing but it's really not and it all makes sense.The film is generally lighthearted. It was not meant to be serious but is Halloween serious? No, Halloween is fun and this film captures that. This doesn't mean that this film is a B film, no not by a long shot.There are obviously serious horror aspects, people will die (brutally) sometimes, some of the stories are pretty morbid but in the end it always seems to take dark yet humorous ending.I seriously recommend this for any fan of the holiday.",Trick 'r Treat

Trick R Treat is a very well made gorefest that is reminiscent of classics such as Trilogy of Terror and Dr. Terror's House of Horrors, with four stories of madness and mayhem interwoven together on Halloween night. Featuring old and new ideas, with some unexpected surprises that keep you giggling and screaming till the very end.

The four separate stories that intertwine throughout the night kept the pace of the movie up and all of the acting was great, even by the pre-teens in the ""School Bus"" scene. This movie is destined to become a cult-classic and I'm positive I will be watching it every Halloween from now on. The dark humor mixed with some very neat shock moments only added to the campy horror that we all love from time to time. It's a shame this film wasn't given a theatrical release, for I'm certain it would've done quite well. I only hope when it hits shelves Oct. 6th that people won't cast it aside simply for being a direct-to-DVD release. Highly recommend this great little horror gem!",Trick 'r Treat
220,joeampfan,anthology of halloween horror,9,21 February 2010,"This horror movie was better than most movies that go straight to DTV, it was really more like a comic book than a movie. It's an anthology of five interwoven stories that happen on the same street on Halloween.I don't want to give away too much because it will spoil the fun, but the five stories are: there's a couple who find out the hard way the terror that happens when they blow out a jack o lantern before the midnight hour; there's a scary high school principal who's actually a serial killer; a college virgin might have met the right man; an old hermit is visited by a mysterious trick or treater that no one would want a visit from; a group of teens go too far in a prank.My favorite scene by far was the school bus crash with the special weird kids, definitely one of the better scenes I've seen in the last few years in horror movies.

224,stormcatcher-2,A fun indie that will hopefully become a Halloween classic,8,12 September 2012,"After seeing all the negative reviews here, I had to post my review actually siding with the majority, for once. Don't believe the haters. If you loved and miss old-school campy schlock horror fun-fests of the eighties and before, like both ""Creepshow"" movies, ""Tales from the Crypt"", ""Twilight Zone: the Movie"" and similar films, then you should enjoy this one.As many people here have pointed out, the four tales in this movie are interwoven with crossover narratives and coincidental points much like in ""Pulp Fiction"". The new ""rules"" for Halloween, apparently, are:1. Never blow out your jack-o-lantern before Halloween night is over2. Always give out treats 3. Always wear a costume 4. Always check your candyIf you follow the rules, you'll be fine. If you don't...Be warned, though, as atmospheric and fun as this film can be, it doesn't rely on heaping amounts of gore (thank goodness) - and it isn't afraid to be QUITE politically incorrect, to the point of really getting in your face about it. Children are menaced, some female characters are portrayed in an overtly slutty manner, and when there is violence, it's...well, violent. And while this all may seem pretty easy to assume when it comes to a horror film, it bears repeating probably because that's the factor that has probably caused so many people to dislike it. It doesn't try to appease the gorehounds, but it's definitely not a kid's movie...and by going its own way, it runs the risk of alienating the people who ordinarily claim to love horror movies the most. And that's a shame, because this is a fun, intelligent (yes, I.Q. and horror CAN co-exist), well-written movie that deserves its acclaim, and if there were more movies like it, the genre wouldn't suck so bad. And when you think about it, isn't an indie movie supposed to set itself apart from the rest of the crowd by being different?I also adored the fact that many scenes went overboard on the Halloween props. Some reviewers found it garish, I found it charming. It's obvious from start to finish that the writer for this movie LOVES Halloween, and all the fun and scares that should go along with it. I hate unnecessary revamps, sequels, and prequels more than most people, and I would *love* to see a follow-up to this one, as long as it's written and produced by the same team. And if anyone wonders why this movie was delayed for two years before it went straight to DVD, it's probably because that the folks at Warner Brothers didn't think that enough people would ""get"" it, and because it's not directly derivative of any pre-existing franchise, they figured that no one would be interested. If you rent the film and enjoy it, prove them wrong by buying a copy and watching it with your friends. It might become a new Halloween tradition for you.",Trick 'r Treat

And above every other sin for which it is guilty, it commits the ultimate sin: it is boring.The high-gloss veneer of the film can't conceal that there is no there there.

227,afkeegan,A great Halloween movie!,6,12 June 2011,"Halloween is truly the greatest holiday! After waiting through the awful summer months, full of sticky heat, punishing sunshine and repugnant bugs, the season of death comes and we celebrate the melancholy passage with candy, darkness, cold and all things dreadful and mysterious. Halloween is a combination of innocence, fear and mourning, and that is why it conjures up such lovely, complex visions. Anyway, this movie is a very enjoyable Halloween season flick. A handful of interlocking, spooky tales are interwoven in a dream-like, drifting way that is still very easy to follow. There's lots of silliness here, for sure, and the twists and turns are at worst predictable and at best clever but never scary. What works here is the haunting poetry of image: burning pumpkins, full red moons, dead leaves scuttling across back roads, a little girl wandering the night in her home- made witch costume and a creepy little imp with a burlap sack for a head who always seems to show up when there's evil going on. It's very evocative and enjoyable. If the film had retained a little more of it's mystery and hadn't shot for the broadest possible audience I'd say there's some art here!

When I saw ""Trick 'r Treat"" was hovering around a 7 on the IMDb, I thought I might be in for an actual 'treat'. I was wrong. Don't waste your time on this movie, even if it's playing on basic cable and the only alternative is a marathon of Punky Brewster.Without offering any spoilers (other than the movie sucks), my chief complaint is this: the actions of the characters often don't seem believable.For example, from the opening: if you had decorated your house for Halloween more elaborately than even Disneyland, would you then start taking those decorations down right in the middle of Halloween night, while the streets are still teeming with children? No one would. The movie offers a feeble reason, but really it's just a device to put a character into a situation required by the plot.

The best motivation, in my opinion is when something gets made because someone had a ghost in the back of their head and heart that just wouldn't leave them alone. They had no choice but to totally consume some nagging memory or need by way of committing it to a motion picture story. This form of motivation is clear from the first beat of Mike Dougherty's ""Trick R Treat"".I've always been in love with Halloween; the colors and chill of fall, my small town getting painted with jack o'lanterns and white sheet ghosts, getting to look like some fantastic creature, and candy! candy! candy!.When I was about 12, I started amassing a list of films I could ceremoniously watch every October. Like everyone, my list included the horror classics, but most of the movies (even the ones that take place at Halloween) still didn't totally capture the feeling of the holiday. Two stand outs that did were ""The Lady In White"", and ""Midnight Hour"".""Trick R Treat"" earns it's place among the rare films to actually spill over with the untouchable feeling of Halloween when you're a kid. It does so and then keeps going. There isn't a single false note in this film. It's a rare and obvious labor of love that if you connect with, you come out of feeling every bit of affection for the subject matter as the filmmaker.Black and white; if you love Halloween, You will love this film.",Trick 'r Treat
233,Bleam66,Silly and then scary!,9,30 September 2009,"Wow. That is what comes to mind when I review this movie. It has been said for some time that horror is over done and nothing unique comes from it; this is the movie that proves it wrong. What Batman Begins started for comic book movies, this has done for horror movies. With that brief monologue of my praising over with, let's get on with the review.When Trick R Treat first begins, you will find yourself very confused. Those familiar with Sin City will find a little resemblance here. What I mean by that is, it is confusing from the start but is painting a much larger picture for the ending, there is numerous stories going on at one time but not confusing, and they all co-exist in some form.The main issue I found myself scared of was how did this not get a theater release? Why did it take so long? Questions that normally have answers in the same category: the movie is garbage. To my surprise, this could not be further than the truth as Trick R Treat is a true Halloween film. It takes the element of Halloween itself, a goofy tradition where we dress up as whatever, and have a good game of dress up while destroying our teeth. In that same essence, Halloween to many is the spooky side of life, where monsters and witches, skeletons and ghouls, spirits and demons, and everything in between. Trick R Treat takes from that as well, turning a Halloween night into an unexpected twist and turn adventure of horror.More than once you will find yourself saying, ""This is silly."" and within the blink of an eye, be saying to yourself, ""What the...did that just happen?!""We, the fans of horror, and even those who are not, are finally granted a gift that is absolutely an instant classic.But in all this rambling coming from my exciting, is the story any good? I am so happy to say it is. While I mentioned it is four stories, they do not play in a Creepshow fashion. Instead, everything is happening in different sectors. For example, a select group of children trick 'r treating will meet with another character, who later on will see what happened to him from a beginning confrontation in the beginning. It does sound rather confusing and bland, though there is nothing confusing or bland about it.The main reason I kept a lot out about the story is, there is just so much to experience and so many twists, that you have to see it to believe it. From the beginning to the very last words spoken, there is a twist and an unexpected turn.You owe yourself to see the greatest Halloween movie since...well, Halloween! Anyone who enjoys a causal blood-fest, a movie to enjoy with your other, or something to have an excuse to sit down with the friends and family and enjoy a good Halloween film, this is it. Don't hesitate.The only reason I can't give this movie a 10/10 is because it just ends too soon!",Trick 'r Treat

Some dumb boy doesn't check his candy before eating it and pays the ultimate price when he comes tries to pocket all the candy from the house that belongs to his Principal. Not bad on gore. It had some unpredictable stuff.Surprise Party. Laurie the virgin walks through the woods while her friends go to a party with dates. She encounters a vampire who attacks her, but the twist is she and her girlfriends are the real wolves. Better than the Principal because it was more surprising.Bus Massacre. The legend of the bus massacre where the 8 kids were so mentally disturbed that their parents paid the bus driver to off them. Then 30 years later four kids return to pay respects to the dead. This episode sucked bad. It was boring and predictable, one of the worst of the whole movie.Meet Sam. In this episode we discover who is the boy with the sack on his head when he confronts Kreeg, who we learn is the survivor from the bus accident. This is probably the dumbest episode of all. It was too confusing to understand. All in all, while the movie wasn't the worst Direct to vid that I saw, it was just a little cut above the average crap. 6 out of 10.",Trick 'r Treat

Nerd-con geeks may like it because you didn't see it, but now that you can, the trick is on you.2. Common thread throughout is weak. Gaping holes in the plot leave room for boredom and tired silence.3. Acting was fine, but really, what acting was there? As an anthology piece, there was no room for character development resulting in flat performances form otherwise talented actors.4. Porn stars make notoriously terrible ""scary"" faces. The credit to Vivid Video during the credits only proved this point.5. The music was right for a comic book blockbuster, but not for a horror flick. Bad choice.6. Lollipops are not scary. Nor can they be used to kill anyone, unless from diabetes.7. The editing was a messy affair, jumping back in forth through time and stripping away any hope of suspense.8. Did I mention the gaping plot holes? Well, they deserve another line.9. The film looked great. Very sleek camera-work/lighting and well crafted set pieces.10.

I have pointed out that there may be spoilers in this review as a precaution.This movie will go down as a classic Halloween treat along with the oldies that is, if enough people get wind of it. Being a horror nut myself, I tripped on this one after browsing through the list on my TV box. I was not disappointed.4 darkly-humorous, spooky, sometimes pretty gory and clever stories are all intertwined perfectly making it unique and a whole lot more intelligent than your average slasher movie.A few well-known faces are also in the mix such as Anna Paquin and Brian Cox which also makes the movie enjoyable (especially as they're decent actors). The stories themselves are very entertaining, my favourite being the ""The School Bus Massacre"". Very spooky and shows children really can be cruel! I love the fact that this movie doesn't take itself too seriously but still manages to deliver a perfect mix of Halloween spookiness and good fun.Best viewed with a group of mates, some beers and popcorn in the dark :D!",Trick 'r Treat

With that much said, this is the most enjoyable horror movie I've seen in a very long time! Rarely do I run out and buy something on Blu-ray after watching from a rental service, but this was one of those odd additions to my collection. I'm not sure how something this good was shelved for so long, while Saw and Final Destination movies kept getting distribution. Getting to the actual movie, it was scary,creepy, humorous, imaginative, and downright entertaining - everything a good horror movie should be. The Sam character is another instant classic, and I hope we see him again soon. The way the stories are told, and the way they are interwoven together was nothing short of genius. My favorite story is ""Meet Sam"" since it reminds me of an old Tales from the Darkside episode titled ""Halloween Candy."" But in general, all the stories are very good. I can't say enough good things about this movie - even my wife - who hates horror movies admitted she enjoyed it. I hope we get a part 2 sometime soon...",Trick 'r Treat
238,e5312,A spooky all-about-Halloween film,10,15 January 2012,"If it comes to Halloween, what would we expect from Legendary Pictures? In my opinion, it's surely an old school Halloween story with monsters, freaky music and a great bunch of jack-o'-lanterns. And that's exactly what this movie treats you with. The brilliant way how the story is built up will surely amaze you, just as the holiday spirited atmosphere which will get over you in the pretty dynamic opening scene and stick with you during the whole film (and probably the whole upcoming day). The four stories of terror are all somewhat cute and scary at the same time, which I think can be the effect of those short moments when the kid with the potato mask on shows up. As I said, cute and scary at the same time. The actors do great too, all the characters are lovable and unique. Perhaps it's not the scariest movie ever made, but creepy and entertaining enough to turn you into a really nice Halloween mood. One of the best Halloween movies I've seen so far, so if you don't want to watch it since it's not the season yet, save it for next Halloween cause it will work, I promise. Just don't forget to place lanterns next to your front door and treat the trick-or-treaters with sweets unless you want the potato-masked kid to come for you and teach you to respect Halloween more. That would be quite an experience though.",Trick 'r Treat

All the stories are solid and unpredictable and filled with surprises, I also laughed at quite a lot of things that were really hilarious and well written, I am a solid believer that humor can only help horror films become better and more memorable and original. I can only hope for a sequel, but warner brothers put the gun to that idea when this film was scrapped from theatrical release and dumped out to DVD almost 2 years after it was intended to be released. they apparently didn't want to compete with one of the ""Saw"" films...what a shame.",Trick 'r Treat

All I'll say is that the writing is very lazy; so much so that you don't even know what's going on most of the time. There are practically no reasons why anything is happening, so it makes the viewer confused. Apparently this pumpkin boy just exists and wants to kill people? Why? Who is he and what are is motives? Give us some background knowledge before throwing in action scenes and expecting us to be intrigued in them. Also, the characters are given no background whatsoever and are thrown on screen in a flash with expectance that you will be interested in their storyline. I can somehwat appreciate the interwoven storylines, but even in that aspect, they could've done much better. All in all, this film is all over the place. Just incredibly lazy and messy.

But anyway it's an awesome movie. The mood and tone of the film were perfect, the directing was great, and the story was nice with some cool twists. The acting was good too ( and why is it good actors come out in horror movies,James Woods/Vampires,Bruce Willis/The Sixth Sense,Nicolas Cage/The Wicker Man yeah it's horrible and but pretty damn hilarious).Better than all these recent remakes and so called PG-13 horror movies.",Trick 'r Treat
243,rus_ty,"I wasn't tricked, I was treated!",8,16 August 2012,"Nowadays, there are so many horror films out there that are packed full of mindless gore, repetitive jump scares and little plot. The many sequels of Saw relied on all gore and no story, the Hostel Trilogy is plain sick, (even though the first one was just about OK) and many many others that probably couldn't satisfy the sickest minds. Which brings us the difference between Trick R Treat and all those other terrible horror films out there. Trick R Treat sure is original. It's not some mindless blood fest, it doesn't have pointless nudity, and it isn't some crappy remake of an original classic horror film that we are getting so many of these days. It's purely an original horror film, and it's a breath of fresh air. Trick R Treat is an indie, stand alone horror film directed by Michael Dougherty. The film that contains 4 individual stories that all tie in together at the end of the film. The stories themselves are actually very good, keeping us on the edge of our seats with interest and gives us a nice little twist at the end of each one that even managed to surprise me when I watched it a second time a few months later. Sure, it's not the scariest film ever made, it isn't that gory either. What it is is clever, old school original horror that separates itself from all those other horrors out there.The stories revolve around a young teenager (Anna Paquin) looking for someone to have her first time with, an irritable old man living alone, a school teacher with a dark, twisted side, and a horrible school prank revolving around what seems to be only an urban legend. Sound simple enough, right? Well, each one has its own shock and twist towards the end, and how they all link in with each other is really well done. One character I particularly liked was the creepy young child with the pumpkin like mask that appeared in each story. He doesn't feature in much, but he really gets to shine in the very last scene that is defiantly worth the wait. So give it a shot, it's something new that sadly we just don't get enough of these days.",Trick 'r Treat

It's just a fun movie and it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's nice to have something different like this. Usually your choices are a cartoon special or something gory and disgusting for Halloween. I mean, I like horror movies, but come on! Sometimes it's a bit ridiculous with the shock and gore. This movie is a little bloody but it's not so much so that it gets aggravating. I really liked how all of the stories blended together. There's a little of everything from Halloween in this movie, which could have turned out a mashed up mess of ghosts, creatures, and urban legends. Instead, it's done so well that it flows perfect and is really enjoyable. Trick 'r Treat is definitely near the top of my list of movies to watch every Halloween!!",Trick 'r Treat
245,bradythatepicbro,Trick 'R Treat movie review!,9,20 December 2013,Trick 'R Treat is a direct to DVD horror film from the writer of Superman Returns which i was personally not a fan of and that made me feel of course skeptical about the film. But then i decided to watch the film and boy was i surprised!Trick 'R Treat is one of the most original horror films i have ever seen. Sure the trailers make the formula seems familiar and the concept is so unique and different compared to other horror films. The plot is on Halloween night and a young boy with a burlap sac over his head named Sam and he seems different than most other people that night. I'm not going to spoil it but it is sure as hell unique. The way that Michael Doughtherty wrote this script is a concept that seems like an extremely different take on the horror genre. Watching this film i was in complete awe knowing that this film was made by a first time director and how he could move the camera and light the area perfectly. Overall Trick 'R Treat is one of my personal favourite horror films and i cannot wait for the sequel coming out in 2015.,Trick 'r Treat

248,theworstpirateever,Now we know why it had such a hard time getting a release,2,11 October 2009,"I want to say this now. I strongly suggest that instead of reading the review or seeing the film, keep with you your image of what you -thought- the film would be. Whatever you imagined is at least twenty times greater than the final product.For starters, throw out everything you've been told about this film for the past three years or however long. All the urban legends about why it hasn't' been released, and how terrifying it truly is. This film is... a rather campy anthology horror in the (attempted) style of Creepshow and the like. Sadly, unlike Creepshow, there's not much to enjoy. The humor is sub-par at best, no real chills, it's not even the kind of bad horror film you'll watch just for gore, bad acting, and random nudity. Instead, you get the following:1. Couple have a little fight, woman is sort of a strawman to set up the theme of the film (there are rules to Halloween, follow them or the kid from The Orphanage will kill you.) Woman hates Halloween, she dies (not really gory, beyond the sounds and a quick glimpse at her remains.)2. Doctor guy is a sociopath, kills a fat kid that destroys pumpkins, acts like he's going to kill his own kid, but then it turns out he's training his kid. -Really- terrible work on this one.3. Mandatory Jerkass Chick (they're sort of a genre staple, so I won't really bash them for this) pulls a prank on a mentally challenged girl, but then the prank becomes reality and everyone but the mentally challenged girl dies offscreen (you hear it, however.)4. Vampire kills some chick, stalks another. Then it turns out the vampire is actually the above sociopath doctor in a costume, and he gets killed by werewolf-sluts to the tune of Marilyn Manson's cover of Sweet Dreams. I'm willing to say most of the budget went into this one really awful segment.5. Old cranky guy gets a visit from That Kid From The Orphanage, who is apparently a skull-alien thing with a pumpkin for a head. He pulls off an homage to the first Childs Play, then leaves the old guy severely wounded. It turns out the old guy was responsible for the death of some mentally challenged kids in story #3, and in the end they kill him (kinda offscreen, you just hear it and see a few comic stills of it.)The only reason I'm giving this a 2 out of 10 rather than a 1 is that I only felt bored and longing for the movie to end during about half the film. I've seen films that felt more like I was watching paint dry for an hour and twenty minutes. This was more like reading bad attempts at creepypasta.",Trick 'r Treat

The type of movie that you continue to think about during the day, because it left such a good impact. This is that type of movie.It IS a frightening film but not extremely scary like some have been making it out to be. It manages to have moments where you keep wanting to watch because you want to see what happens next. In my opinion, that's what makes a good horror film. There has to be moments that make you crave for more.The film is very well written and the characters are both memorable and interesting. It's not a horror movie where you really don't give a crap about what happens to the characters. These are well developed characters, even in the short run time of the film.Just watch it. If you want, wait till Halloween comes around. It's definitely the one movie I'm going to put on at night on Halloween for years to come. You definitely feel the spirit of Halloween while watching this and it pulls off the look of it very well.If you like good horror and you're sick of the new modern horror crap that comes out, or if you just love Halloween, then I definitely recommend this.

But considering what could be lacking from such a film, I ventured to the heart of the story and finally realized that Trick R' Treat is, simply put, devoid of any scares.Don't get me wrong: this movie is anything but boring. From pumpkin-faced terrors to blood-sucking creatures, this movie has its share of creeps. Not only that, but each of the separate story lines (there are 4 total) are woven together so slickly that there are bundles of shocks you won't see coming.But none of this can make up for the fact that Trick R' Treat is, at its best, only creepy; a movie that used the same layout and attained the same tone as ""The Twilight Zone Movie."" I was eagerly awaiting the moment when it would break off from creepy and truly get scary, like John Carpenter's ""Halloween.""

This movie isn't exactly aimed at anyone age group. This movie really does capture the feel of Halloween and to me it's like one of those stories that you tell with a flashlight underneath your face and your friends all circled around you! It's like a gift that keeps on giving and surprises around every corner! This is not a movie that will shake you to the core but just makes you think while you watch it.

Personally, I would have loved to have seen this in a theater, but thanks to WB's mishandling of the film, I've had to settle for watching it in my living room. Whatever the reason for them shelving the movie for two years, it certainly isn't diminished when viewed at home. Dougherty's movie still comes across like a work of art, and a lovingly crafted homage to his favorite holiday.Every frame of the movie literally oozes Halloween atmosphere, and is gorgeous to watch. The production design is top notch. The direction is excellent as well. He manages to evoke both chills and laughter, sometimes both at the same time. Not an easy task. He also manages to breathe new life into the anthology format by making all the stories intertwine with one another (think Pulp Fiction for example) instead of having each tale be its own separate entity like most films like this tend to do. He probably had to have a flow chart when he was writing this thing to keep up with all the different plot elements.If Halloween is your thing, then I definitely recommend this movie. It pretty much has it all - Werewolves, zombies, vampires, serial killers, and a few more spooky surprises along the way.

Remember the spooky old house at the very end of that dark road that you were too afraid to go to? Remember those ghostly tales told on Halloween night that made you afraid to walk back home by yourself? These are the elements that Halloween is made of and ""Trick 'r Treat"" promises to deliver them.Most horror movies nowadays are nothing more then pointless gore/torture fests or unnecessary remakes. Don't get me wrong, they too have their place in the world of horror, but it is getting rather redundant, and this is why Trick 'r Treat offers a breath of fresh air to the horror movie goer. This film doesn't waste a single scene as each one is a necessary contributer to the intertwined story lines (trust me, It was cleverly done). Both the directing and writing were excellent as well as the acting. The characters were not given much background which only adds to the mystery and lets your imagination take over. Were there any dry spots? No way! Trick r' Treat instantly dives into a pool of terror and constantly injects the viewer with of a feeling of horror anxiety. Sure, there were a couple of moments in this film that everyone has seen in other horror movies before, but It didn't feel like it was stealing those ideas, rather it was paying tribute. The very few predictable moments of the movie do not, in anyway, strip or tear down the value, quality or entertainment of this film. It is sad that Trick 'r Treat never made it to theaters and has become a needle in a haystack, but it's movies like these that are cultivated into cult classics. Overall, if you love Halloween and you love classic horror movies, then I absolutely guarantee that Trick 'r Treat will easily become one of your new favorite horror films.

259,MidgardDragon99,Halloween's New Horror Classic,10,28 September 2009,"I think by now many, if not most, are aware of Trick 'r Treat's long and winding road to release. To recap, WB killed a potential franchise by not having the faith to release this critically acclaimed Halloween film to theaters. Why? No one really knows. But it's October of 2009, two years after the film was meant to be in theater's, and finally we at least get to see it on DVD. It was worth the wait.What makes Trick 'r Treat so special? No, it's not particularly scary. It's not the ""make you jump out of your seat"" kind of fluff we're now used to calling ""horror"". What it is is an anthology of interconnected Halloween night stories that feel like something you would read in a classic book of spooky stories that you may have read when you were a kid. There's the gruesome, the macabre, the frightening, and perhaps most importantly the hilarious. The film falls in line with Raimi's comedy horror classics like Evil Dead and Army of Darkness, and is even a step or two better than the also-excellent recent release Drag Me to Hell.I'm not going to summarize the film here. Lord knows I hate having to skip over a summary because I either don't want to be spoiled or have already seen the film and don't need to know what it's about. What I will do is tell you that you need to see this movie if you're a horror fan or someone that loves the holiday of Halloween. This film captures its spirit like no other, even the film by John Carpenter that owns the name. It does so by basing all of its mythos and storytelling around the holiday, rather than just using it as a backdrop like other films have done. The main villain, ""Sam"" is suitably creepy and the other characters are well-acted and interesting (to say the least).The sound design, set design, costuming, directing, art direction, and everything else about the film just come together to make the perfect storm of a Halloween film. People will be watching this for years to come to celebrate the holiday, and it's sure to become a Halloween tradition.",Trick 'r Treat

The only good thing I can say about this movie is the good point they had, that murder is very easy and amusing during Halloween. But this doesn't makes the movie watchable, oh hell no. No don't watch this movie if you doesn't enjoy eye pain and terrible movies... No really, this movie sucks.",Trick 'r Treat
261,grega_salabajzer,Halloween guidebook!,10,17 October 2009,"Trick'r treat is a guidebook for how to survive Halloween. The message of the movie is that we see Halloween like a good way to get drunk and have sex. We forget why our ancestors celebrate Halloween. They celebrate it because they want to protect themselves from evil spirits. The evil in movie is shown in four different ways. Dead children, werewolves, serial killer and pumpkin kid, who is like a Halloween guardian and like Inquisition he's hunting the ""heretics"" and turning them in to believers. The film is fresh and unique. A lot of people compare this movie with Halloween. I think that that comparison is wrong. They have nothing in common unless the holiday(Halloween). But Trick'r treat is one of the best horror movies in last few years!10/10",Trick 'r Treat

263,hpoirot88,Crash meets Creepshow,8,7 August 2011,"Ambition ruins movies. Period. Horror films suffer the same fate, so many try to scare the living daylights out of you or attempt to add a new spin to an old (and overused) genre. Masked men, torture, etc... I've been tired of the same old tricks for years, but Michael Dougherty's little horror anthology was a nice treat.This movie plays into the very essence of Halloween itself. Everything about Halloween plays a part. From Jack-O-Lanterns, to candy, to ghost stories, to the creepy old person living in the run down house with the mean dog. All the stuff works into the plot. To watch this film is to enjoy Halloween itself. I won't divulge the plots of each but, the film presents to you 4 tales of terror, each interwoven into another (unlike the piece by piece style of ""Creepshow"" some may not like this, however) You see characters from each plot in the background of the others. Speaking of background, the cinematography was wonderful and (having watched this in the summer) made me long for a breath of crisp, cool, autumn air.Everything in this movie is good. The big actors don't out shine the kids, neither story is more essential or larger than the others, the director doesn't try to make this anything more than what it is. So with the ambition gone, you are left with a better product that sadly was confined to DVD but is easily obtainable (I got my copy free with another purchase) Enjoy this movie around Halloween or if you're just in the mood for a bit of spooky fun. But skip the popcorn and sit down with some candy corn instead.",Trick 'r Treat
264,joecookiemonster,Worst and most Clique film ever,1,9 January 2016,"The reason why I give this film a bad review is because it promised so much and didn't fulfil. Last night I decided that I wanted to watch a really good horror film (like insidious or the omen) but I was sadly let down. When you first glance at the film you think it is a very good Halloween- themed horror movie. First off, the characters were so terribly unrealistic. One, the girl dressed up as red riding hood is 26 with a stunning body and still a virgin. This makes no sense for someone who looks so nice. Two, I'm really surprised that the kids would of even been allowed out so far out of town so late. Three, the murderous dad was just so clique. I knew that he was wrong in the head the second that he was shown. Also, why did his next door neighbour not notice that when he was in the ground he was hiding bodies. IT WAS SOO OBVIOUS. BTW thank you for that really cheesy joke. Another thing is, I knew that when the girl was alone the vampire guy was going to kill her. In general just a really bad film and a complete waste of time. :(",Trick 'r Treat

He's a tiny murderous, creepy, cute little guy who will literally slash you with the razor blades you forgot to check in your candy as well as his own sharp sucker. This is one horror movie that uses four different stories and ties them together perfectly! It's not so much jump scares but it's definitely psychologically scary when you break it down. Sam lives up to the rules and exacts revenge justly to where you root for him. Everyone that got what was coming to them did and there were numerous surprises that keeps the movie interesting.

266,ChipNoirD,A modern faery tale with a purpose to its deceptive simplicity.,10,6 October 2009,"For those of us who remember what came before Disney's myriad of princesses and talking animals, there's been a distinct something missing from the realm of children's media. There are no longer evil witches who threaten the lives of firstborns. There are no wicked queens being forced to dance to death in iron shoes. No ugly stepsisters are having their eyes plucked out. No fear. Legends of fear and blood used to riddle our cultures, but today's culture has buried this under PC. Trick R Treat is a fresh attempt to bring some of that storytelling back. Indeed, there are plenty of Big Bad Wolves, and karmatic endings that should satisfy anyone with a good sense of humor.The plot of the movie is quite simple. A small, cloistered Ohio town celebrates Halloween with festive eagerness. Those that do not follow the ancient customs are summarily punished. The film cuts back and forth between four (plus one minute) distinctly different plots interweaving through the timeline at once. None of the plots are particularly deep. But anyone who says that depth is a measurement for fear must have forgotten the pure terror a camp fire story can instill.Admittedly, the scares aren't that profound. But the film never sets out to be so to begin with. We're supposed to be on the side of spooky justice, and its dolled out in with a heaping dose of macabre humor. The gore is minimal, but that's okay. As this decade has proved, copious blood a good film does not make. And while no character is deep, every character is integral to weaving the overall story and its purpose. It is a commentary on how much we have forgotten what can lurk in the shadows on All Hallows Eve, and makes fun of us for it. Its also a commentary, for me at least, one how ridiculously self-involved large corporate films have become. This film is simple, sweet, and rides on its own two-legs without relying on anything else but folklore and urban legends.The few (and possibly justified) bad reviews this film receives are based on the ignorant assumption that because this is a horror film, and a halloween one, that it should either set out to be as terrifying as possible, or else be scrapped by the wayside. I urge you to leave this uber-critical thinking behind when you sit down for this flick. Much like the old campfire tales of the BabysitterPhone Stalker or The Back Seat Axeman, this movie sets out leave you a little spooked, a little amused, and perhaps thoughtful. But its all meant to be fun. You critics remember what that concept is, right? Or shall we just write off others, such as Evil Dead for example? This is no venture ofcharacter study. There is no Lauri Strode, there is no Freddy Kruger.There is no deep, ominous meaning. Much as the holiday it represent should be, this film is fun, and reminds us of what lurks in the dark. So check your candy, don a mask, where your hat, and enjoy this fun little farce. Those with an open, positive mind will be rewarded with a holiday classic that is sorely needed.",Trick 'r Treat

268,Madmax56,Do yourself a favor and watch the trailer instead! ***SPOILERS AHEAD***,4,28 July 2012,"Here is a case where the trailer is better than the actual film, sad to say. I was one of the many people eagerly anticipating what was being hailed as a new ""Halloween Classic"" in glowing reviews before this film was official release. I was stoked seeing the trailer in March 2007, and could not wait to see what looked like a dark, atmospheric horror film centered exclusively around Halloween. When I heard the announcement that 'Trick r Treat' would not be getting a theatrical release, I even wrote letters to Warner Bros. executives asking WB to release the film onto DVD.Well, after finally getting a chance to see the movie in Fall 2009, I found myself very disappointed. In my opinion, I did not find the movie funny, clever, or scary. The ""twist"" with one of the female characters 'Laurie' is kind of clever watching it again, but really does not add much in my opinion to the overall atmosphere of the pic. Also, none of the characters are likable, relatable, or well developed - most of them are just monster chow anyway. Character wise, it would have been nice to get maybe a few characters reminiscing about past Halloweens, or get involved in some trick-r-treat mischief; stuff kids do on Halloween!Story is pretty fumbled too, as we're never clued in as to why some people have supernatural powers/abilities, and it was disappointing to discover those you thought had powers (i.e. ""vampire"") did not. Did not care for the serial killer principal. Felt out of place and really detracted from the opportunity to get involved with other story arcs that would be more relatable. Also, the final sequence of the film with the old bus driver and ""Sam"" really dragged on for too long.Is it all bad? Not quite. Some of the set pieces are nice, particularly where Laurie is walking down the path in the forest laid side to side with jack-o-lanterns. And the decorated neighborhoods are done pretty well also, capturing the mood and tone of the season. But that's about it. Still, the tone and atmosphere of the trailer itself is superior. I can see now why it was shelved for 2 years. For a superior film surrounding Halloween, I recommend ""The Mightnight Hour"" (1985) instead. Better characters, atmosphere, and actual elements of horror.",Trick 'r Treat
269,leadercobra,"Fun, lightweight horror anthology",6,6 October 2009,"I'll admit that I really got over-hyped to see this movie after reading about how great it was for a couple years now without being able to actually see it until today. It didn't live up to my personal expectations but I still liked the film. It was fun, but not much more than that. The film centers on 4 stories which rather than presented one at a time are sort of awkwardly strung together. The effect doesn't work because uneven amounts of time are given to each story at a separate time. During the height of tension for one story, it will cut to the next story. The role of several of the characters, namely the ""narrator figure"" Sam is unclear. Is he a demon? Is he a protagonist who defends the honor of halloween or just a sick little pumpkinman/murderer? I also felt that the ""scary"" factor just wasn't present with this film. Was it entertaining to watch? Absolutely. I also feel like it had a great visual style. A+ for cinematography, music, costumes, etc. The tension just wasn't there. A principal murderer isn't a scary concept...neither is a vampire stalking teenage girls. There's a ton of similarities between this film and the best horror anthology of all time...Creepshow by George Romero and Stephen King. Creepshow is the superior film, as it's able to create breathtaking suspense as you're able to laugh at the same time. The comic book pages to life translation is also present in Trick R Treat. The central narrator character is present (Sam vs Creepy). The old hermit story is there (they're creeping up on you). The revenge from the grave story is there (the bus children and the fathers day cake), etc. The comparisons that can be drawn are endless, especially since Creepshow mostly invented the horror anthology on film. This movie certainly as moments of greatness. The flashbacks on the ""short bus"" as well as the ending ""fight scene"" are among the highlights but I found most of the film lackluster. For a film that I desperately wanted to like so badly, I found myself largely unimpressed with this release other than the great eye for visuals. If you don't have suspense and story, thank god they were great.",Trick 'r Treat
270,loveofmovies84,Film-making at its finest!,10,27 October 2009,"Trick 'r Treat is the work of a born filmmaker, a sumptuous and consistently enthralling work of art that lingers in your mind for days and weeks after you see it.And yet, for some reason, the movie has been denied a theatrical release by the people at Warner Bros. studio. It was originally scheduled to hit the big screens two years ago, but got shelved becausewell, I honestly don't know.Were the studio executives really afraid of the competition? Did they honestly think that an original Halloween movie released in October was really going to lose financially to the umpteenth Saw movie or the latest Asian horror movie remake? It's hard to fathom just why Warner Bros., the same company that released such gems like Battlefield Earth, The Adventures of Pluto Nash, and Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever over the years, was so scared to release this movie, especially considering that the few people who did manage to see this movie have had nothing but positive things to say about it.It doesn't matter now. Trick 'r Treat is now available on DVD, and it is easily the creepiest, most stylish and original genre film that I've seen in years.The movie marks the directorial debut of Michael Dougherty, who was born just a few days shy of October the 31st and is positively in love with the season.His love for All Hallows Eve is evident in every frame of the movie, as Dougherty gives the proceedings a rich and enchanting autumnal visual polish and instills a gleefully macabre vibe that is reminiscent of the EC Comics of yore.He also uses a number of old school visual tricks that serve the movie well. There is not one single use of CGI in the movie, and surprisingly enough, not one visual effect shot that looks fake. There is a werewolf transformation scene late in the movie so frighteningly realistic that it alone makes the movie worth seeing.Trick 'r Treat takes place over the course of one Halloween night, in a small Ohio town that is practically obsessed with the season.A cross between Creepshow and Pulp Fiction, the movie tells five different stories that are connected in one way or the other.The first story involves a Halloween hating young wife (Leslie Bibb) who makes a big mistake in saying ""I hate Halloween!"" out loud; the second follows a school principal (Dylan Baker) who moonlights as a serial killer and plans to play a really nasty trick on the local trick or treaters; the third (and most haunting) tale follows five kids (Britt McKillip, Jean-Luc Bilodeau, Samm Todd, Alberto Ghisi, Isabelle Deluce) as they go investigate an old town legend involving a school bus massacre; the fourth is a delightfully wicked tale of a young woman named Laurie (Anna Paquin) who ventures to the town parade with her sister (Lauren Lee Smith) and her two sexy friends to find some decent men (that's all I'm gong to say about that); and the final tale involves a cantankerous old hermit (Brian Cox) who is being stalked by a small child with a burlap sack over his head.Said child is identified in the press notes as Sam (played Quinn Lord), and he makes an appearance in every story, often times acting like the Angel of Death to anyone who doesn't uphold the traditions of All Hallows Eve.Michael Dougherty's screenplay is absolutely superb. He brilliantly ties each of the five stories together's with a number of surprising plot twists, and he manages to keep the audience fully involved by writing up characters and dialogue that are surprisingly authentic.The terrific cast manages to bring the material all the more to life, with special mention to Dead Like Me's Britt McKillip, who brings humanity and depth to the role of the insufferable snob Marcy; Anna Paquin, who turns her character into a sweet yet somewhat sinister figure; and newcomer Samm Todd lights up the screen as the socially awkward Rhonda, who has a monologue about the history of Halloween that is actually quite amusing.Visually speaking, Trick 'r Treat is one of the most lush horror movies I've ever seen. The cinematography by Glen MacPherson is simply jaw-dropping. The production design by Mark S. Freeborn, art direction by Tony Wohlgemuth, and set decoration Rose Marie McSherry are all positively dream-like. The musical score by Douglas Pipes is as original as it is chilling and atmospheric.One would be hard pressed to find anything to complain about with this wonderful movie, although the faint of heart should be warned: While the movie isn't as graphic as Saw or Hostel, there are numerous scenes of child endangerment and even a few instances where kids are killed.Thankfully, Dougherty films most of the graphic stuff off screen, but even still, there are instances where he makes you use your imagination, and sometimes the impact can be greater with that approach (there is one scene in particular that disturbed me greatly without ever showing an ounce of gore).Casting that aside, Trick 'r Treat is an absolute joy to watch. While the movie has been around for a couple of years, it didn't get a nation wide release until this year, so it technically counts as a 2009 film. With that being said, Trick 'r Treat goes straight on my list for the ten best movies of 2009.",Trick 'r Treat

Instead, it is an intertwined escapade that moves at a healthy pace and keeps you thinking. If you are looking for a movie where you get to think, and the outcome of nearly every scene is contrary to your beliefs, then this movie is for you.

I don't think it deserved to be released at all! Lame stories, no surprises, Trick R Treat went straight for all the clichés - you know slutty teens, lesbian vampires, evil little kid with a burlap sack. It was a collection of shorter films not really giving time for any character development - I never felt any connection to the characters whatsoever and I really couldn't have cared less if they lived or died.A good horror movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, cheering for some characters and anxious to see what happens to them.

If you like suspense you'll also be very disappointed - there is not a single moment in this film that warrants a jump or increase in heart rate. Unless you are a fan of slightly corny and cheap horror films this movie will disappoint! The movie attempts to tie the stories together but does so in quite a sloppy manner, which while making sense, still feels extremely forced.

I had already seen it and wasn't impressed, but was intrigued however to see if I kinda grasped something that I didn't see before. NOPE! Nothing, the movie still sucked.

While the impressive special effects and heart-stopping scares come fast and heavy, the plot doesn't really pick up until the last half a hour of the film, plodding along into an almost incomprehensible mess that was only saved by a couple of well-executed (excuse the pun) twists. Just like the fore-mentioned effects and shocks, the characters in the movie are brilliantly crafted, creating a whole host of devilish ghouls that will haunt your nightmares long after the credits have finished rolling.

I don't know if anyone remembers this far back, but the original release date was actually April of 2007, as announced at the completion of the film. Here were are two and half years later...it's arrived. The wait was not in vain. ""Trick 'r Treat"" is a tribute to Halloween. The wait and hype may have put unrealistic expectations in the minds of some. The movie is not without it's flaws. The stories are interesting...but not very scary. The acting is good...but not great. The intertwined plot is very cool, but it takes a lot of unraveling on your part, if you blink, you might miss something (or someone). After viewing the movie you realize that it's actually a movie about love. The love of Halloween. While Carpender's 1978 slasher film was a straight forward horror plot, set on Halloween, ""Trick 'r Treat"" is a series of several different plots ABOUT Halloween. There is really no comparison between the two. Basically it's as fun as movie could be. But, don't expect to have a life changing horror movie experience.

I hope the trivia comments about Warner Bros.' holding this film from release because they may have to compete with Saw movies wasn't the true reason. It would be easier to believe that the studio has executives that are vindictive against the film creators because their other movie didn't perform as expected. If you avoid watching ""anthology"" films because you can't bond with the characters, please give this film a chance. The storytelling interweaves the characters, so you learn a little about each of them along the way. It is truly a great horror movie that leaves a lot to the imagination instead of showing the non-stop blood & guts of some of the current 'torture porn' movies like Hostel. My newly purchased Trick 'r Treat blu-ray is going right into my yearly Halloween viewing schedule, along with the original ""John Carpenter's Halloween"", ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", numerous Vincent Price & Universal monsters' classics and some truly frightening Asian ghost story films.",Trick 'r Treat

Somewhat of a side note; I'd been expecting this movie several years back for whatever reason, but promptly lost track of it. Anyhow, this turned out to be a wholly different picture than what I thought it would be. The poster alone made me skeptical. I found that I had been comparing this film to other films I have seen recently, most notably We Need to Talk About Kevin and The Blair Witch Project. Both films are quite dark, but in completely different ways. One is a human drama that is tragic and claustrophobic. The other is ominous and brooding, all due to the homemade quality, and that ENDING!! I would argue that this film is just as dark, but in such an a--holish way. This film knows no boundaries. This sticks to almost no rules as to who can or will die. There are multiple little motifs and homages that are pretty neat. My personal favorite callback is Dylan Baker's son in the film looks like an actual Chucky, like the demonic doll from Child's Play.As mentioned, this film is one that is more or less a Halloween/Pulp Fiction mash up. Now many films have tried adopting Quentin Tarantino's manic style of storytelling, but most have failed (the one film that comes to mind is The Sasquatch Gang.) This film pulls it off very well. Some of the stories don't exactly mesh perfectly, but it's fluid enough that it does not distract from the film. What got me about this film, and this is the weirdest thing, but it ended too early. The story had technically finished, but I still wanted something else. I don't know what exactly it was. Perhaps more closure on certain characters? Another story line? I'm not saying the film is incomplete, but I really wish it had been a lengthier viewing. It's hold was so strong on me that it loses a star for being so tight. This is easily one of the better Halloween themed films, I would go so far as to say of all time. It's so hard to find modern films that are as deeply affecting. This hits all of the right notes, maybe a little too well. This is not a very predictable story. Instead, it's a unique, well written, and marvelously made film.",Trick 'r Treat

The story is smart, and is put together beautifully.The characters are perfect for each of their roles, especially Anna Paquin, as little red riding hood. you have to listen to the dialogue carefully to understand later how certain things they say have different meaning when you find out what's going on.Horror movies should take a cue, i've seen few movies this carefully thought out and filmed so good it makes you creeped out.I loved this movie, and although it was not long enough for my liking, i can only hope they put out a sequel.rent this, actually you might as well buy it!!",Trick 'r Treat

I loved how it was kind of like Creepshow, but with the stories all intertwined. Anna Paquin is great, you go girl! I did not see the twist in her story coming whatsoever. I love True Blood and she is great here too. I used to watch that show Dead Like Me and recognize the one girl from that. She was great playing this bitchy little girl. The story about the guy who is a principal and kills a little fat kid was great. This movie really got me quite a few times with the twists. It was funny and shocking at times. I don't think this movie is over-hyped at all. Tonight I'm going to try to get Drag Me to Hell.",Trick 'r Treat

293,cletwinch,Trick 'r Treat - Review by Cody Letwinch,8,4 December 2015,"Good horror movies almost seem like a thing of the past. It seems like they almost all have the same basic story line, cliché characters, and rarely ever provide something new to the genre. Thankfully, Trick 'r Treat is a breath of fresh air.This horror anthology has four tales (five if you include the opening sequence) and ingeniously interweaves them together to create one great Halloween film. Michael Dougherty does a beautiful job with this. This film takes place entirely through Halloween night and the stories all take place at roughly the same time. As the stories continue on, more things throughout them will begin to make sense, and it becomes a treat when you get to see characters or events from previous stories. Again, another thing to add in to make them all mend together and feel the same, even when they are completely different.This is one of those films where the less you know about it, the better. That being said, I wont go too in detail to the stories. I will however, go over the basics behind each of them; There is a couple who find out what happens when they blow out a jack'o lantern before Halloween ends, a high school principal with a vicious secret, a college virgin looking for that special someone, a group of teens take a prank too far, and an angry recluse meets his match with a trick or treater. As I had expected, my synopsis does not do the stories, or film, justice. TRUST me, it is much better than it sounds.You can see already there are some things about this movie that differ from other horror movies, but it also differs from other Halloween themed movies. It never loses focus of what it is: a HALLOWEEN themed horror movie. Most movies will throw in a scene or two of pumpkins or people in costume and call it a day. Trick' r Treat makes sure to add something in every scene. It never feels like 'just another horror movie'. The look of the neighborhood and atmosphere make it feel like how you remember Halloween when you were a kid. You know what I mean. Where the whole neighborhood decorates, it always felt cold, dark, spooky. It brings you back to that, and if you are a fan of Halloween, you know exactly what I am talking about. To top it all off, not only is the villain wearing a costume too, but he is using a broken lollipop as a weapon.The acting in this movie is surprisingly very well done, as the actors are all relatively unknown. One of my favorites is Steven, the high school principal. He not only comes off as very creepy, but they make him feel like an eerily familiar character. The kind that makes you want to think twice about your 'normal' neighbors.Trick'r Treat is for sure in my top five horror movies, and definitely my favorite annual Halloween movie. Not only is it dark, and at times uncomfortable, but provides the perfect amount to comic relief to balance it out.Movie Score - 8/10My Video Reviews: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu0V4XqrDELwySLhjcvWVuw",Trick 'r Treat
294,catizzz999,I saw it!,9,11 October 2008,This movie is So awesome. It is worth the wait. I wish they would release it now. It deserves a theater release-not straight to DVD. It is 4 stories that are intertwined. If you love Halloween you will love this movie!! The imagery alone is fantastic. The stories are great and Sam should be a cult classic. (He is the child in the movie.) It simply tells the rules of Halloween and you must obey them. Or else! Let's cross our fingers for a speedy release! I know I'm going to buy the DVD. I have no idea why the delay? The comedic timing mixes perfectly with the horror. It is scary in parts. It truly captures the meaning of Halloween to me.,Trick 'r Treat

I could bored you with a long winded in depth review, but I don't need to and I'm not going to. Trick r Treat will be up there with all the greats in years to come, it really is that good. Hopefully in future we'll see Sam return he's a great horror Icon and very mysterious, how he's interwoven throughout the movie is amazing. I can see Trick r Treat being on my Halloween watch list every year as John Carpenter's Halloween has been for over 25 years. Halloween the true Holiday season, can't wait!

When we had films like Creepshow, Return of the living dead, Nightmare on Elm street and many more great horror films. This movie is sure to go down in history right along side those classics.This film is an anthology that takes place during Halloween ( hence the title ). Unlike other movies filled with different stories this one brings them all together. It all happens on the same night in the same town. The film is filled with talent. You have Dylan Baker ( Let's go to prison, Road to Perdition, Happiness ), Tahmoh Penikett ( Battlestar Galactica ) and Anna Paquin ( True Blood, Hurly Burly ). You'll be sure to find her situation funny in the film if you're a fan of True Blood. The movie deserves recognition. So please go buy the DVD, Blue Ray, On Demand, Direct download or better yet demand it to be shown at your local theater. Yes, believe it. They actually made a great horror movie in the 21st century.

Cinematography was attractive. Soundtrack was appropriately cliché and had a nice classic Halloween feel. Casting was well pieced together. I hope there will be a Director's Cut that gives even more back story on some of the characters. Some of them were very interesting but we're not given much time to get to know them. Doesn't leave plot holes... just felt like the kid on the amusement park ride, ""Can't we stay on just a little longer?..."" All in All this was a great ride!

305,iqbal2009,A great film that captures the essence of Halloween,8,11 May 2012,"Although Halloween is months away, I decided to watch Trick r Treat because I was in the mood for some horror. Although this movie isn't ""Too Afraid to go into the Basement""-level of scary, this movie does have a great, creepy tone to it and captures the essence of Halloween extremely well. It made me feel like a kid on Halloween again, which are some of the most magical moments in childhood.A note to those who have not seen it yet, this movie revolves around multiple plot lines and characters, and although there is no central story to this film, the characters and plot lines do intersect at times. Remember, Halloween is the night where all things creepy come out to play, and the story focuses on multiple of these creepy things, not just one. Keep this in mind so that you are not thinking ""just how the heck is this all going to tie together?"" which is what i kept thinking.",Trick 'r Treat

What ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is to Christmas films..""Trick 'r Treat"" will be for Halloween. It captures the essence of the spirit of Halloween. In my opinion, the film plays great Homage to the old Vincent Price, Boris Karloff horror classics. Four great Halloween tales very cleverly woven in to one.The setting and atmosphere of the film really grabs you and if you are not in Halloween mode before this film...you will be afterward. The writer & director put together for interesting tales that take you on a spooky Halloween adventure. If you are expecting a Gory trite horror flick then this film is not for you.The acting is really good and the direction is even better. The film is creepy but without overdoing it. It is scary without being too predictable. I cannot believe studios released Halloween II and put this film direct to video.I rented this film and the next day I went out and bought it.

Especially the part with the werewolf, even sesame-street puppets look more convincing. The one bit I did like was the part with the little alien. That part stood out in the movie. Almost as if it did not belong there. Anyway it was only mildly entertaining. Might also be part to the fact Europeans don't have a Halloween tradition. So we can't connect to this tradition.

Halloween is a tradition, in as much folk lore as in movies, and multi-stories like this need to made to encourage a little speculation of horror amongst people at that time of year. Okay, this may be a funny, black comic ideal, but it's still great. Name me one other that wasn't; Creep Show, Body Bags, Twilight Zone were all very funny. These movies are essential for anyone who likes horror, and indeed, anyone who likes that season of year. You have to enjoy yourself at Halloween!P.S. I am one of those British people who put as much stock in Halloween as Americans do. Personally I think the Americans have this one right.

311,elmigue,Great Halloween Movie!!!,7,20 October 2009,"This film was originally scheduled for Halloween festivities in 2007, but Warner Bros., without explanation or apparent reason, move it from his agenda without putting new release date. Later this was moved to be released by Warner Premier division in charge of so-called ""Direct To Video"" and my expectations considerably diminished, but given that Bryan Singer would be his producer.This weekend I had the opportunity to see this movie, and indeed was a surprise from beginning to end, showing us some stories like ""Pulp Comics"" during Halloween celebrations in a small town in Ohio where a young couple argues on the desirability of respecting the rules of the night of the dead, a school director shows his darker and savage nature, a beautiful young girl dressed as Little Red Riding Hood goes concerned about the loss of her virginity, a group of friends investigating the terrible accident suffered by a school bus carrying mentally handicapped children and a surly neighbor will face a sadistic and mocking spirit of Halloween.The narrative structure that has this movie is simply incredible, as its director and writer Michael Dougherty shows details that at first and even beyond our understanding can go unnoticed but gradually become meaningful as we are developing and watching the common point in each of them, without losing the style of type ""homage"" films of the 70's.The performances are more than correct in the development of each of his characters, showing us such familiar faces as Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Dylan Baker, and so on.For Trick 'r Treat to be a surprise for all of the above and now has the potential to be a classic of the Halloween season, I give it a good 8/10.",Trick 'r Treat

In a superficial plot like this, unfortunately it's hard to understand the function of some characters in an unfulfilled Later- Before game that serves to keep things unpredictable, (i guess at least). Failed... It's really far from being scary and far from intelligence. Nothing more about this movie to comment on, i forced my self to write even 10 lines (minimum length required) to warn people that want to watch decent horror movies like me.

313,pece-6,A Movie That Doesn't Solely Rely on Blood and Gore?,10,29 October 2011,"About a year ago I first heard of this movie, I constantly saw it on IMDb and Netflix but never watched it. Tonight due to a horrid case of boredom along with an imprisonment due to a cold I decided to watch it. All I expected was another ""John Carpenter's Halloween"" instead I got a movie that I haven't the ability to compare to any other.As I came onto the first scene and saw the makings of a horror film cliché with a man watching from a distance, a woman with a hatred, and the tension of a jump scene I readied myself to call John Carpenter and inform him of the most recent thievery he is suffering, but quickly I found that I need not waste my minutes (Yes I am that much of a cheapskate), because I got what I didn't expect and no, it was not only the twist that I admit I did not see coming, but a movie worth watching again and again for it combined the best elements of Samhain. From the elements we hailed as children to the ones that we may hail in our later years. So now I bang away on my keyboard still confused on some parts and blown away on others all while prepping myself to soon look back fondly at the memory of this film for this film unlike ""John Carpenter's Halloween"" that I need to watch year after year to remember the story line (Which consists of me asking myself ""Who gets killed now?"" and moments that I pretend to have not seen that coming), for it is memorable, clever, unique, and grasps you until the final moments of the film. But truly it is not only due to the writing I wish to someday be able to exceed but I also found myself caring for the characters and wishing for their survival (Course I even feel melancholy for the loss of a coconut depicted in Cast Away). You can see the fear in their eyes and hear it in their voices and even when you speak yourself others can sense the same fear in your own as you watch the characters escape a fate not many wish for or not manage to be as lucky. Even what is normally the weak point I notice in movies, the child actors, was truly well done, I do not know for sure, maybe it was only that he didn't completely depend on the child actors or knew to not give them to many lines, but the acting from the children, from the teenagers, from the adults, and from the elders was of a quality you do not normally see in scary movies. But still many of you, or at least you horror movie junkies, may be wondering why I rated it as a 10. Because of the old rumor that horror movies are scary and the fact that this movie is not scary. Well, like most people I don't get scared by a man sticking a knife through the babysitter's head or a monster who has seen better days and lumbers at the rate the same movie the monster was depicted in seems to be, at least when it is only being portrayed on the silver screen. I have grown to enjoy watching a movie for its writing, for its acting, and even for the camera work that I feel might just come in handy someday if I get lucky, not for cheap thrills and an experience that makes you want to throw up, honestly if I wanted that I'd ride bad roller coaster (And the fact that I am scared of roller coasters and not scared of anything by John Carpenter or George Romero is not only a shame I cope with but a statement about the horror genre). Do not attack this movie for the lack of cheap grade-C blood and body parts so obviously made out of plastic that you assume you'd have to be drunk or at least a fool to believe is real. But, if you do attack it for those reasons, than try learning what a good movie truly is.So, I suggest if you are a fan of good acting and directing alike, watch it.If you are a fan of quality writing, watch it. If you wish to relivesome nostalgia of Halloween moments you had as a child, adult, or teenager, watch it (Some moments may not be very nostalgic.. At least I hope they aren't..) but these stories are those times that you wondered ""What if"" while you went to a groovy or fly Halloween party, while you answered the door to a few Trick or Treaters, or while you ran up the doorsteps of the old man across the streets home (And the fact that throughout the movie I saw many cheap plastic props I own myself added a lot more reality than a tree with a bloody corpse hanging from the limbs along with leaves or the coincidence that more then one group is hiding out in an old barn). So for all these reasons I deem the movie as one that has quality high enough to watch even the credits. So, for God's sake stop reading my freakin review and watch it already!",Trick 'r Treat

It stood on it's own as a refreshing alternative to the torture porn and gore overload that the mainstream film industry has counted on as its bread and butter the past few years. I enjoy guts and horrific deaths as much as the next horror junkie but I prefer something with substance as well.This movie was fantastic and I don't say that lightly. It takes a very high calibre of visuals, acting, directing, production and storyline to impress me and this film has done it all. Warner Brothers should be ashamed of shelving this movie, they have done a major disservice to cinematics around the world by keeping this from widespread viewing.The film features 5 stories that overlap or interact with one another and deal with a variety of Halloween related age old horror stories. Director/writer Michael Dougherty has successful re-envisioned these into a phenomenal multifaced story unlike anything that has been on screen in a very long time. The poster monster Sam, a creepy yet compellingly cute, childlike trick r treater shows up to observe or have his own bloody fun in various scenes.I loved this movie!

Can you please send me the copy that you have all been watching as I think they have given me the reject one!!!! Thanks for reading.... Apparently I have to write 10 lines about this film.. I do not know what else to write other then that - The Beginning was BAD The Middle was OK and the END was GREAT!!!!!! Because it had finished...... Acting was OK, story line could have been good but WAS NOT.... cross between DUSK TILL DAWN and THE KUNG FOO FLID.....",Trick 'r Treat
321,darksidegames,Best horror movie you NEED to see! Because this is the way it should be done!,10,18 October 2009,"When horror movie buffs think of Halloween these days, mostly what fans can think of is a poor white-trash kid who grew up to wear a mask and carry a knife. Others think of a dying man taking revenge on the entire human race, one poor idiot at a time with a puppet and a tricycle. And then there is Sam.............TRICK R' TREAT is an anthology of four stories woven into one. It starts out with a 50s type Halloween safety video which adds to the tone of the movie preserving the traditions of the holiday. All four main stories are woven together in a style that works very well for the film with a little orange footed pajama trick r' treater as the glue that holds it all together. Sam is an awesome character. He is to Halloween as Santa is to Christmas. He's Original, creepy, mysterious and of course deadly. There are twist within the stories that are executed in a perfect fashion not giving away anything until they unfold. the best part to me is watching it again for the 2nd time. You then pick up on little things you missed like, little bits of dialog and on screen eye catches to make it even that much enjoyable to watch over and over. The only extra you get with the film is ""Seasons Greetings"",an animated short created by Michael Dogherty that first introduces you to Sam. It may leave some of you DVD extras collectors screaming ""Where's the beef!"" but it will make anyone who ends up loving this film asking ""Please Sir, may I have some more?"" Trick r' Treat is not meant to be a overly done scary movie, it's a horror movie for fans who love Halloween and horror cinema. Your girlfriend might find Sam cute and you might find a joke or two to laugh at in between the suspense and fright. This movie was delivered in a way all horror should follow. And above all else it is very, very, entertaining.This movie has an appreciation for the holiday and has a tone that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats waiting to see what is going to happen next. It's an instant classics! I really hope Sam has a sequel. That Lil guy deserves it! Best damn horror movie since the original Halloween. (sorry Rob Zombie and Lynard Skynard fans). And Mike? Thank you for giving fans something fresh. Saw 29 comes out soon....but do yourself a favor and buy this film. Not only will it add to you horror collection, but it will damn near complete it....until the next one that is. KEEP THOSE PUPKINS LIT!!!",Trick 'r Treat
322,phillipeng25,Great Halloween Film,8,20 October 2009,"This movie is like pulp fiction, creepshow, and classic wicker man all rolled into one. The movie is shot very well for a Halloween movie. Like other comments posted on here, it shows the vision of halloween through the producers eyes. This is definitely going to be a classic. It has the feel of an 80's horror movie sharing the same elements like April Fools Day and Night of the Comet. This movie took a very long time to release and the wait was worth it for me. For some it was probably not worth waiting for. Regardless, it has been released and is worth watching. The film though is not very scary and is more of a fun ride than extreme horror. This may not be for everyone so rent before you buy.",Trick 'r Treat

Unfortunately, it never got a decent release. Just when I thought I'd never be able to watch this masterpiece, news that it's coming out in DVD was great news!!! Since I was not sure if it'll be released on video in the Philippines, I ordered via Amazon. Another wonderful surprise was how quickly Amazon shipped the DVD, I thought I won't be able to get it before Halloween. Alas! It came within two weeks from being shipped out from the US. The movie was fantastic, it went beyond my expectations and will be one of my top favorites especially during October. In the tradition of Creepshow, the movie tied together four different horror stories on that one time of the year when evil runs free. There were a lot of unexpected twists that made me wanting more. The casting is perfect! The only thing I didn't like about the release is the lack of Special Features. We only get the short film ""Season's Greetings"" where we see the 1996 origin of Sam. Overall, I am loving the DVD!!!",Trick 'r Treat
324,hubbard-amanda,Trick R Treat is amazing!,10,25 October 2009,"I have only seen this movie once but it is definitely a movie that you will want to watch a thousand times after that one first watch. It was a really good Halloween film. It had enough bits of everything that is Halloween. A serial killing father who I swear just stabbed his own child, an old man getting what he deserves after a bus incident, a woman really understands what happens when you blow a pumpkin out before midnight, a girl has her ""first time"" and seems to really enjoy it and four children get the prank of their lives. It is most definitely a movie that you will want to put on your must watch Halloween movie list.",Trick 'r Treat
325,jmb1800,Worst Movie Ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1,28 October 2009,This was the worst movie I have ever watched. There are multiple story lines mixed together with no clear beginning or end and a almost nonexistent connection between them. Killing is pointless and happens often but rarely shown just right before and the rest is up to your imagination. There are kids that die by a lake as a weird girl laughs (who was picked up at another characters house but is never shown there with that part of the movie) A woman gets killed by a jack'o lantern kid thing which they don't explain his existence. I SHOULD BE PAID FOR THE TIME I LOST WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE THAT IS TIME I CAN NEVER GET BACK. This should have never been made or released for public viewing and should not have all of the good reviews it has got it is terrible. If you are reading this hopefully you have not yet waisted your time watching trick'r treat and if this is the case head my warning and do not watch this movie.,Trick 'r Treat
326,stevend1354,"Masterfully Done, Even if Lacking Gore",10,1 November 2009,"This movie was Superb. I loved it, and thought there were a few creepy parts. Just the suspense, and the twists and turns were great. And at the end how all the stories came together was masterful.I think the movie was a classic even if there wasn't hardly any gore or a lot of violence. It was still a very exciting movie to watch due to the story lines. There were very few plot holes if any. The only Confusing story was the Virgin Story. I was a little confused at the end of that one. It turns out they were all werewolves. Also, The last story with the little Jack-o-lantern guy was crazy. He didn't want to injure the guy, just wanted the candy. That was very well done.",Trick 'r Treat

I was surprised by some of the Actors I recognized in this. When i rented it from my local Video store I was expecting some low budget shlock horror flick, but this turned out to be very well written,had decent actors, and good directing.It wasn't nearly as predictable as many horror films tend to be. sure some parts you could see coming, especially if you're a horror buff, but it wasn't a completely re-hashed cliché plot like many other titles.a great fun movie. definitely worth a watch",Trick 'r Treat

I was so displeased with this movie i cant believe i actually finished it probably because the was a good looking girl or two in the film it ended up being a lame pumpkin head rip off its completely fictional with terrible acting if your a horror fan and even consider picking this up think twice and grab something else... for your sake,Trick 'r Treat

I was intrigued all the way through the movie, and despite what I have heard from others and seen on reviews, I thought this was great. I recommend it. I plan on watching this movie on future Halloween nights. I thought the characters were cast perfectly, everybody fit very well into their role. It wasn't over-gory, but it had enough to keep it interesting. Not overly scary, but a good Halloween flick that is interesting. It kept me guessing until the end, to say the least. Don't listen to the negative critics of this movie, give it a try. Or maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to listen to the negative critics, because that way you could be shocked at how good the movie was, that's basically what happened to me.",Trick 'r Treat

I don't even know what i just watched which just explains how random and stupid the storyline was. So the principal or whatever was a vampire or something lol? Ill honestly tell you the only thing i enjoyed was when i laughed my arse off to the scene where the principal is trying to bury the bodies and keeps getting distracted. Honestly was a waste of time and ruined my night, please do not watch this movie as you will be disappointed. I do not understand how people can give it such a high rating its just a stupid movie i would never look at ever again.",Trick 'r Treat

But it just wasted 1 hour and 22 minutes of my night. I had to give it one star because it couldn't go any lower. But I have to say one good thing about it and that's the one good twist. Not going to spoil it. But other then that, it had no good story to it. And it goes from the beginning of the movie to the end. Back to the beginning, to the middle. Back to the end to the beginning. It got so confusing, and you had to miss part of the movie to even think about what was going on. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",Trick 'r Treat
332,mthompson29,Really...really...don't bother.,1,21 October 2011,"****Contains spoilers**** Does anyone have 79 minutes that I can borrow please? Why? Because that is the amount of time this God awful film has stolen from my life.Maybe I'm being harsh. If you like films that have absolutely no point to them; aren't entertaining; have no feasibility or continuity then I reckon you'll love this little gem.Myself and my partner bought this DVD under the misapprehension that it was going to be a great film - largely based, may I add, on the reviews from this website.To coin a phrase from today's mobile/text era...WTF? It was just silly. Silly I tell you. A child-like killer that, in the opening scene, struggles to drag a corpse even a few feet yet somehow summons the power to lift the victim and impale her on a stake that is over three times the height of evil pumpkin dwarf's body. Grrrrrrrreat start!! Someone on here had the nerve to liken this film to John Carpenter's Halloween. I can tell you now that Michael Myers would not be in the same room as the pumpkin headed dwarf. Do you know what would happen if Michael Myers and the pumpkin headed dwarf were ever to be in the same room? Michael Myers would hold out his arm, place his superior hands on it's little pumpkin head and hold him back whilst it wildly swung it's arms around like an angry little cartoon character.I actually can't begin to discuss the nymphomaniac little red riding hood and her clan of angry vampires - because during most of these scenes myself and my partner were talking about 'actual' horror films. It held my attention for a nano second when the connection between the crazy neighbours became apparent...but then, alas, back to boredom only to end with the special needs kids from the swamp.My advice on Trick 'r Treat? Don't answer the door. If you buy it you will regret it. More importantly if someone you know watches this film, enjoys it, and then lends it to you...then you should no longer consider that person to be a friend. If it's a relative then although you have less options with regards to disowning them, I would probably be more wary about how much time you spend in their company. Nobody who enjoys this film can be sound of mind.",Trick 'r Treat
333,lmoreau,Not bad if you're bored but seen much better,1,24 October 2009,"My roomie and I rented this last night after the trailer seemed okay. I wouldn't say it was horrible, but it's definitely more of a ""stream from a free website"" versus paying to rent it.The atmosphere is really good in the movie I'll give it credit for that, but the story jumps all over the place between 4 different mini stories. One thing I found confusing was that it tries to play on Halloween traditions and what happens if you break them. The ""always check your candy"" part is definitely true, but the whole ""don't blow out a pumpkin before midnight"" I've never heard of before and I'm huge on Halloween and horror movies. I think if that were true we'd all be dead, as it's next to impossible to keep them going all night without the wind blowing them out non stop! If you're looking for a Halloween themed movie then this isn't bad, but don't get this if you're looking for something scary or gory. I certainly wouldn't classify this as horror, as it's more comedy since you'll constantly be like ""huh"" or ""what the #$@#$ is going on???"".Comments about this being the best horror of the decade, or being compared to Halloween are a total joke. The only comparison this has to Halloween is that they are about the same holiday. They don't compare at all. If you believed everything this movie said, then that whole town would be devoid of people since there's 4 different things killing people on the same day! Avoid this, it's really bad!",Trick 'r Treat
334,nika-monkey,Probably worst I've ever seen?,1,18 November 2013,"Whether its intentionally bad or unintentionally, it is a terrible movie. Mixing up the chronology of the film is always an interesting technique to keep viewers on their toes however this is a ridiculous amount of chopping and changing that actually just makes it hard to follow. I don't like paranormal/fiction topics at the best of times but a gravity-defying, immortal, pumpkin-kid is beyond saving. Please do not even get me started on the wear wolves? Literally just an excuse to allow some attractive girls to moan and rip their clothes off, not to mention that it had ABSOLUTELY ZERO RELEVANCE TO THE PLOT. What irritates me the most is the ""subtle"" Halloween references such as ""Laurie"" and the Michael- Myers-esque figure staring at the woman in the start. This film should not even be allowed to call itself a slasher let a lone tie itself to the most famous slasher of all. 1 out of 10 (purely because there is no zero option). Would not recommend to my worst enemy to be frank.",Trick 'r Treat
335,klautriso,A movie that is really about Halloween.,10,26 April 2013,"This is a pretty good movie to watch. It's a great horror Anthalogy about occurring events that happened on Halloween night, from not respecting the tradition and to zombies taking on revenge. This movie ain't a ""Hard-Core"" horror movie like say the ""Halloween"" series. There's no intense violence or Sexuall scenes that will make kids cry or anything like that. This movie really defines what ""Halloween"" is all about like the Jack 'O Lanterns, The candy giving, The kids trick r treating, and wearing costumes on Halloween night. Like i said there's no Intense violent or sexual scenes in the movie though there are some scenes where you should not see when your stomach is full but it isn't that intense to make you puke.The movie also defines the rules and regulations of Halloween and it shows the consequences when you disobey any of them. The effects of turning out the candle light of a jack lantern can be futile, not checking your candy can be poisonous and lethal, and not giving treats can be dangerous. So people should just follow the ""rules"" to avoid any thing going wrong on Halloween night.The first time i watched this movie i thought it was going to be boring at first but when i watched it I was wrong and in fact this movie is really fun to watch though a bit creep but overall this movie is awesome. The movie has a great plot and story line and you can easily understand the movie and each of the stories are connected to each other. This movie is one of the best horror movies that I've watch since ""The Ring""I can't think anymore great ways to say how good the movie is but this movie deserves a 10 out of 10.",Trick 'r Treat

I myself, had never heard of it, until I saw it on some IMDb-list and gave it a go. I was stunned that this movie had not been released in cinemas. The acting, stories and producing were class! The movie is basically a story teller, it's not just one story, it has many stories and each one of them all combine together in the end. This movie is not necessarily a really scary movie, but it's really entertaining and fun to watch, so if you are going to watch this movie thinking that it will scare your guts out, then you are not on to the right movie. I highly recommend this movie, especially on Halloween.",Trick 'r Treat
337,hitchcock-blonde-796-765410,Four stories weave themselves around each other another Halloween night.,8,27 October 2013,"I read a review of this film that proclaimed the release of 'Trick R' Treat' was bogged down by some inconveniences and delays. After some research I found this to be true, and I couldn't help this making me like the movie more. These release issues forced this film to be mainly viewed via a word of mouth basis, which adds a lot of charm to it.All the usual elements of the horror genre are relevant here: Blood, Sex, Booze, youngsters with an attitude, grumpy old men, and psychotic middle class middle aged characters. These days so much of the fundamentals are lost in horror films. If it doesn't fit some cliché's that have now determined the very outcome of so many horror films then we don't heard about, and we certainly don't see it. Not to say that fantastic horror isn't out there, but one has to to some searching to find any real gems in this decade. I didn't recognize any of these actors, which let me know them only as their characters, that being said, I think they all were spot on. These characters aren't very demanding, but like the universe wouldn't exist if there had been just a little bit more gravity in the beginning, these roles would have been too much if the director demanded anything else out of his actors. The directing is well done, however, a lot of the credit for this film goes to the writers, special effects/make-up/ and director of photography. These areas of the film are what brings it all home and keeps the knitting in tact throughout our anthology.Where as finding really good horror is either rare or requiring more effort than one should have to put in, it is damn near IMPOSSIBLE to find any good American Anthologies. It was a breath of fresh air watching this film. It was a great set of stories that worked well together, made sense, and wasn't needless torture porn horror, or some stupid ghost story that claims to put a spin on its story, but in reality, is just the same film as all the others with a couple of new camera shots or catch phrases.",Trick 'r Treat

I LOVE a good Halloween movie and horror movie in general and this may be the worst ever. Tacky, boring, and the plot has too many holes to deal with. Upon watching the original trailer I could not wait to see this movie and could not understand the issues with it's release and straight to DVD move when it finally happened. After watching it I could not understand how any production company could fund such garbage. Hocus Pocus was much more terrifying than this chop job. I would think any kid with a little ambition and rich parent could fund and produce a movie much better. It went for hip, creative and clever and ended up nowhere near any of the three. I asked around with other horror buffs and film lovers in general and not once has anybody came through with a positive review.

The story is divided into four separate stories that intertwine towards the end if the film, each takes place in the same town on the same night, October 31st. Overseeing all of the horror is Sam, the iconic guardian of the Hallowe'en. The movie looks stunning, the orange and black lighting screams Halloween'en and the thousands of jack o' lanterns look eerie and strangely beautiful. The film isn't all that scary but the final story is very tense and exhilarating, Brian Cox does a great performance in that scene. The effects in the film are all practical as the film makers avoided the use of CGI (thank God) and the effects look brilliant. What I enjoy the most is the originality of the film. There are many twists in the story that keep the film fresh and I could never tire of that classic Halloween'en setting. Trick r' Treat is an underrated gem and although sometimes poorly written, is a fun and sophisticated thriller that is original, tense and exciting. Fully enjoyed it 9/10.",Trick 'r Treat

Review after review, claiming this to be; THE GREATEST HALLOWEEN MOVIE OF ALL-TIME, THE GREATEST HALLOWEEN MOVIE OF THE LAST 20 YEARS, and THE GREATEST HORROR MOVIE TO NEVER HIT THEATERS EVERYWHERE. How could this movie possibly fall short of at least being worth my time??? Trust me, IT DOES!This movie takes a terrible stab (yes, pun intended) at the old, ""multiple stories that intertwine into one,"" story telling model. Sounds great, right? WRONG! It felt to me, as if somebody was sitting around watching PULP FICTION and thought, ""Hey, I could do that with a low budget Horror movie,"" but failed miserably.Not one of the five stories that this movie attempts to intertwine into one, did I connect with in any way. Not one character in this movie, did I feel any emotional attachment with or interest in. Not once did I feel myself tense up, or brace for a moment of scare. Not once was I scared. And not once when the movie was trying to tell an interwoven story, did I feel that the writing was anything but desperate.To me, Trick R Treat was a sad attempt to create an interwoven story out of multiple story lines that were poorly constructed. I love B-Horror. I truly do. So you can imagine my excitement when I found a B-Horror movie that was being called THE GREATEST HALLOWEEN FILM IN 20 YEARS! However, this move was an absolute swing and a miss!",Trick 'r Treat
344,diabeticace,Not bad. Not bad at all.,7,6 October 2009,"That might not sound like the best review but allow me to give you some background. Originally slated for a 2007 theatrical release, I heard about it over a year ago when it was supposed to come to home video in 2008. That never happened. So for over a year I've been reading everything I could find about it on the web (let this be a cautionary tale, there be plenty o' spoilers out there so watch it first, unlike me). Because of my anticipation, it could never meet all my expectations.But it tries.Trick 'r Treat is an anthology horror in the vein of Creepshow with a taste of Pulp Fiction (structurally) and a few splashes of dark comedy for good measure. The separate stories are cleverly and closely interwoven as the characters, who don't all know one another, participate in cameos for each others stories. Helping to connect their tales is Sam, a demon trick or treater whose job is to make sure the ""rules"" of Halloween are followed(Make sure you keep your pumpkins lit and the candy a flowing). Interesting tidbit, ""Sam"" is derived for ""Samhain""- the Celtic holiday that would eventually become Halloween.It's major pro? It's very much a Halloween movie. It evokes the folklore, history and overall spirit of All Hallows Eve. Carpenter's Halloween is probably my favorite horror movie, but honestly it is mostly related to the holiday by title alone. Trick 'r Treat on the other hand exploits the holiday for everything it's got. And does it successfully. I could really see several Trick 'r Treat sequels involving different stories each time (kinda like what Halloween 3 failed to do).Another pro, since Trick 'r Treat was supposed to be a theatrical release, what you end up with is a very GOOD LOOKING direct to video movie.It's major con? It's a bit short. Clocking in at 82 minutes it goes by fast. Many characters need more time for us to like them, or hate them. I'm not saying it should have a run time like Rosemary's Baby, but a few extra character moments would have been nice.All in all, its a fun movie to watch. Its not the best horror film ever and it doesn't try to be. There are a couple twists and a few shocks and within the separate stories there is something for everyone. So if you're a horror fan and especially if you're a fan of the Halloween season you should give it a whirl.Happy Halloween.",Trick 'r Treat

348,islandclaws,How can a film this good be sitting on the shelf for so long?,9,11 October 2008,"Ah, Halloween my favorite time of the year. It isn't so much the festivities taking place that excites me as it's the feeling in the air once October comes. That palpable sensation you get seeing jack-o-lanterns grimly lit faces, kids trick-or-treating in the streets and the aesthetics of fall surrounding you slowly giving way to winter. I think it must hold a special place in everyone, if for nothing else but purely nostalgic reasons. Mike Dougherty is certainly one of those people, as is evidenced by his incredible horror anthology Trick 'r Treat. For a holiday that revels in films of a horrific nature, there sure are a scant few of them that take place on the actual day itself. Dougherty's film is the celluloid embodiment of that je ne sais quoi that has made Halloween such an alluring holiday for generations of kids (and adults) alike.As I said, Trick 'r Treat is a horror anthology which interweaves tales that all take place on Halloween night, similar to such genre classics as Creepshow and Tales from the Darkside. A costumed couple learns to respect tradition the hard way, a group of girls head out into the woods for a ""howling"" good party, the local school principal has a (literal) taste for blood, four kids attempting to pull off a holiday ""trick"" end up becoming ""treats"", and a cantankerous old man gets a visit from a holiday visitor looking to settle a decades-old grudge.To say anymore than that would spoil the fun in watching the film, as these stories are best digested when viewed on an empty mind. The twists are less predictable than most horror films manage these days; half the fun is wondering just where the hell these characters are going to end up. The one constant throughout the film is a costumed, pint-sized little guy named Sam, who does his best to remind people why they should take great care in adhering to the traditions set forth hundreds of years ago for All Hallows Eve. The film is richly seeped in tradition, reminding the audience of just why we celebrate the fabled holiday in the first place. It manages to be effectively creepy and blood-soaked, yet it never goes over-the-top with gratuitous gore. There is also a very obvious helping of black comedy strewn throughout the film, which thankfully never gives way to the self-parody so many horror films feel the need to indulge in.I think the most impressive aspect of this film is the incredible attention that has been paid to detail. Every single shot of the film is beautifully framed and composed, often looking more like a cryptic painting than a frame of film. The austere trappings of Mr. Kreeg's dark house, the ghostly palette of the rock quarry, the incredible shape-shifting sequence around a roaring fire in the woods everything here is gorgeous. That aesthetic, married with the spot-on performances and realistic dialogue, give the film an organic feel that never relies on cheese or parody to break tension. The cinematography by Glen MacPherson (who also shot this year's incredibly brutal Rambo) is so lush it manages to make you feel like you're a part of the celebration. For someone who is as big a fan of the Halloween holiday as I am, this was especially important to see done right. Too often when a film actually does take place on the holiday it lacks the depth that is presented here.For such a large ensemble cast, there isn't any one performance that stands out above the rest  everyone here is perfectly cast. I even enjoyed Anna Paquin as the ""virgin"" of the female group, and she's not always someone I'm crazy about. Perhaps my favorite role is that of Mr. Kreeg, played superbly by veteran character actor Brian Cox. His look was inspired directly from my favorite director, John Carpenter, and there are a couple of well-placed nods to his work that were highly amusing. Also providing great support throughout the film is newcomer Quinn Lord who plays Sam, the little sack-headed minion who ""stiches"" the film's stories together.OK, now here's the biggest problem with the film; the 800 lb. gorilla in the room: there is NO set distribution deal lined up. I was lucky enough to see it at the sold-out opening night screening held at Grauman's Chinese Theater for Screamfest 2008. During the post-film q&a session Mr. Dougherty informed us that he had no idea what the future held for this film. It was set to be released in Oct. 2007 (?!?), then it was pushed back to Feb. 2008, Oct. 2008 and, finally, has been placed on the shelf indefinitely. I'm thankful that Dougherty got some good studio money to make the film to his exact specifications, but, for the love of all things evil, someone at Warner Bros. needs to get this thing out to the masses! I heard rumblings of a direct-to-DVD release date sometime next year, to which I can only say that would be a travesty for something this genuine and unique. I suppose therein lies some of the problem; since this is generally uncharted territory, the studios are clueless as to how they can market the thing. I can understand some of their hesitation (since a good majority of the film features children either killing or being killed), but there's just no excuse to not give this thing some kind of release  and with an October 2008 release out of the question I don't when they could give it a proper release. This is a film that needs to be seen during the month of October, but it's looking like 2009 is the next likely candidate if that were the case. I just don't want to see this film become the cinematic equivalent to the eternally-gestating Guns N' Roses opus Chinese Democracy (which, oddly enough, actually has a release date for now).",Trick 'r Treat
349,jack-59847,It feels like all your kitschy Halloween decortations coming to life.,10,20 August 2018,It's a Halloween movie. It's kitschy. Halloween can be kitschy. It's not a horror movie. Horror movies are not usually Halloween movies. Halloween movies aren't just about horror. The imagery alone in this film just FEELS like October.,Trick 'r Treat

351,brookebt,Fun and Cute Horror Anthology,8,2 July 2019,Some people on here are way too cynical and just don't know how to have fun. Sure there are some plot holes and there are some predictiable things that happen throughout but overall the stories are fun and interesting. While its not a bone chilling movie it is a fun halloween slasher to watch with your friends. It has some nice cinematography and a few likable characters that make the already short runtime worthwhile. The amount of gore and the quality of the effects is also respectable. It may not be high art but it is an enjoyable movie that anyone who doesn't have a stick up their pretentious ass can have a good time watching. To sum up if you are just looking for a movie to watch around halloween and have a good time this is a great choice.,Trick 'r Treat
