0,Fella_shibby,Terrible screenplay n poorly done action sequences. Better watch something on Netflix/Prime/Tubi or better rewatch Sarfarosh which is the best cop movie frm Bollywood.,1,5 November 2021,"Tubi is legal n totally free. They have amazing Hollywood movies.Sarfarosh is one of the best cop movie ever made n it is very realistic, gripping n gritty.The cops in Sarfarosh/Bullit/The French Connection doesn't hang around in helicopters n defy physics.Coming back to this movie, there is nothing redeemable in this movie.Basically its a poor man's Michael Bay movies rip off.Ranveer Singh's character gets on ur nerves with his accent n body movements.So much overacting man.Akshay's character is totally unbelievable n anti physics.His walks, his mannerisms n body language doesn't look like that of a cop.I dont know how Devgn got trapped into this abysmal movie.Some of the 80s Hollywood action movies are much better than this lousy movie.If u are in the mood for realistic n good cop movies then better watch Sarfarosh, Bullit, The French Connection, End of Watch, Training Day, Serpico and the amazing Infernal Affairs. Avoid The Departed which is the remake of Infernal Affairs.",Sooryavanshi
1,SAMTHEBESTEST,An average masala entertainer boosted by Rohit Shetty's unique idea of Cop-Universe,6,5 November 2021,"Sooryavanshi (2021) :
Movie Review -Sooryavanshi has been awaited since 2018 when Veer Sooryavanshi made a surprise entry in Rohit Shetty's Cop-Universe. In the climax scene of 'Simmba', it was clear that Akshay Kumar's Veer Sooryanashi isn't going to be the same cop we have seen before. He was supposed to be different from 'Singham' and 'Simmba' and after watching Sooryavanshi, it is confirmed. An interesting thing to note here is, Veer Sooryavanshi is a combo of both the Super Cops- Singham and Simmba. He is intense like Singham and at the same time he is funny & quirky like Simbba. Rohit Shetty gambles smartly with the idea of bringing together these three super cops in a mainstream entertainer and he adds couple of strong motives like Hindu-Muslim unity and a mandatory glorification of all the heroes in uniform who serve us day and night. The problem with the film is that it is too typical about its graphics. Not a single scene goes without prediction of audience. It seems like that Rohit Shetty hasn't moved from those stereotype glimpses of 'Chennai Express' (2013) and 'Singham Returns' (2015) as if those were great films. The box office success is a whole different thing when it comes to commercial potboilers but sadly it encourages our filmmakers to continue repeating the same things. It's 2021 but Rohit is still trying to make a film of 2011. 'Singham' still remains his best work post 'Golmaal Fun Unlimited' and now after watching 'Sooryavanshi', i am sure that he will never be able to make a high-repeat value film like that. His Golmaal franchise hasn't really got any good film since 2006, and the same goes with 'Singham' (considering it as a pioneer to this Cop-universe). He failed to leave an impact with every film he made after Singham but the problem is, he never learnt from mistakes. Rather, he continued using the same jokes and cliches in all his films because his films were smash hits at box office. Maybe the audience wants to see the same stuff again so i don't blame him much but i must say that he is losing his touch.Veer Sooryavanshi, a honest ATS officer is given this tough task to find out about upcoming threats to the Mumbai City. As expected, we get to see the assemble of three ""S"" cops- Singham, Simbba and Sooryavanshi in an action packed and explosive finale. The screenplay is unexpectedly slow in the first half. Actually, it has nothing to show you. It's just a basic build-up. But then in the second half, it gathers a momentum when Simmba and Singham make dashing entries. Those last 20 minutes deliver a complete mass oriented blockbuster experience with lots of action, comedy (little childish) and heroic stuff. Sooryavanshi fails to create a standalone impact. The best possible reason for that could be the anticipation created about an assemble of three cops. The same thing happened with Simmba too. The same average entertainer of Rohit was boosted by powerful cameo of Singham and then Veer Sooryavanshi's introduction. From the trailer itself you know that there will be two grand entries sooner or later so naturally you start hyping it and forget the main hero. Akshay Kumar as Veer Sooryavanshi isn't a normal police officer, he is ATS officer. There is difference and people need to understand that. You come to know about it while watching the film and then you realise that you can't expect him to be out-an-out massy cop like the one he played in 'Rowdy Rathore'. His funny dialogues and seriously-quirky conversations keeps you engaged or should i say they are surviving factors. Katrina Kaif looks gorgeous in every single scene but for a change, this character provides her couple scenes where she delivers some good dialogues effectively. Unexpectedly, Ranveer Singh as Bhalerao is too childish in this film. I don't know from where Rohit got this idea to present him in so funny manners that you even forget that he playing a police officer. He looks like comedian who is trying to bring those much needed gags in serious situations. That's not what we saw in Simmba. The same mistakes have been repeated with Ajay Devgn's character Singham. Shetty uses his mass values but forgets to keep his class alive. For instance you enjoy watching Singham when he makes a heroic entry but then you suddenly see him doing unnecessary comedy in utterly serious situations. Actually all three cops to be precise. I mean who cracks jokes when you are fighting with terrorists in a locked premises and a bomb on body?Sooryavanshi has a big cast to fill the negative bag but none of them makes any difference. Jackie Shroff, Gulshan Grover, Abhimanyu Singh, Sikander Kher, Nikiteen Dheer all are decent in their roles but nobody really looks like playing a dangerous villian. Of course i don't expect every Rohit Shetty film to have a terrific villain like Jaykant Shikare played by Prakash Raj but please give us something convincing at least. The music adds more glamour and entertainment in the film but slows down the pace. 'Aila Re Aila"" comes with end credits, 'Mere Yaara' is strictly average and 'Tip Tip Barsa Paani' is there right after Interval point to surprise you. It does not match the original of course, but it's Hot! Rohit Shetty repeats those old cliches to satisfy his hardcore fans and maybe that's what they want. The struggle of cinematographer can be seen in those unstable frames. Thankfully, the background score is stimulating. Simmba had better though, which, you can experience here again on Ranveer's entry scene. Singham's BGM is out of reach by far.Coming to the plus points, Rohit Shetty challenges himself to deliver some socially important stuff here. Like in Simbba, he tried to convey the seriousness of 'Rape Cases In The Country', here he brings patriotism and nationalism. He makes sure that every single thing is enjoyed by masses and family audiences. I am not sure if quality cinema lovers will like it. All said enough, i must say that Sooryavanshi is a relief for cinema industry as it brings back that much needed commercial cinema. We have been missing a big event film like this for almost 20 months, and here it is. Sooryavanshi deserves to be watched once with normal expectations. But the hype and excitement of assembled version of cops is left behind. In normal time (in 2020 i mean), it would have been a Super Hit at box office for sure. Predicting the box office fate today is difficult, especially for a film which is entitled to set the new parameters. With Sooryavanshi, we will know the new dimensions of box office so let's support it for that. Overall, an average film uplifted by first-ever grand assemble of three massy friendly characters in modern bollywood.RATING - 6/10*",Sooryavanshi
2,nadkarnisumeet,First experience after 18 months!!,7,5 November 2021,"Sooryavanshi review :Finally something for the theatre owners to cheer about. Also for us, the audience!!The first major Bollywood theatrical release since March 2020 (Baaghi 3 was the major release just before Corona struck us); Sooryavanshi can be called an ideal festive dhamaka to pull back the audience to cinema halls which have sadly, been shut or running empty since then...Rohit Shetty's cop universe extends to Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar), an ATS officer, who along with Singham (Devgn) and Simmba (Ranveer) take on the terror group (Jackie Shroff and company) planning to blow up Mumbai once again. À la March 1993.Akshay is in top form again after Bell Bottom (2021) and the Bangkok action stunts are a treat to watch reminding us of his daredevilry in Sabse Bada Khiladi (1995). Katrina Kaif, playing his wifey, sizzles the screen in the remixed 'Tip tip barsa paani' number from Mohra (1994) though I preferred Raveena's sensuous jhatkas from the original. Yea, the plot is typical '90s stuff but cleverly updated to present times.Infact, the first half is a breeze watch with all the action, emotions and drama unfolding at a super fast pace. Rohit even brings a secular touch in a particular scene where Muslims help Hindus to take Ganpati idol from Mandir to a safe place in course of a terror strike even as a remixed ""Chodo kal ki baatein...Hum Hindustani"" song plays in the background. Pop bhaichara, indeed!!Post interval, the film dithers and withers a bit as the screenplay appears to be in a tearing hurry to introduce its two main cameo characters - you know who!!Ranveer Singh and Ajay Devgn make their grand entry and then, Shetty completely lets the action department take charge. Which ain't a bad decision at all as the stunts are imaginatively executed. Notably, the continous shot of Ranveer bashing up a dirty dozen is superb. Taalimaar!!The dialogues are massy, the technical aspects are okey dokey and the end finale promises to carry forward the franchise with a Singham sequel. Clearly, the focus is to entertain. Nothing more. Nothing less. And that is important...in the current times when audience hasn't been to theatres since early 2020. In that sense, Sooryavanshi truly achieves its objective. And thats why it should be seen. Only in theatres please!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",Sooryavanshi
3,msunando,Action getting the better of the content,5,6 November 2021,"Sooryavanshi starts off with the right intent, pace, narrative and sentiment. The backdrop is the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai, and the masterminds giving the cops a slip, but leaving a live imprint behind - if 400 kg RDX were used for the blasts, where are the remaining 600 kg? Fast forward to 2007, 40 Lashkar operatives from Pakistan sneak into India and commerce sleeper cells all around the country, awaiting instructions from the chief Omar Hafeez (Jackie Shroff) to start another siege. Advance to the current day, Bilal (Kumud Mishra) the key mastermind of the 1993 blast returns to India via Maldives, releasing the cache of the 600 kg RDX from an inconspicuous house in Sawantwadi, and activates the sleeper cells, under the leadership of Riyaz Hafeez, Omar's son, swearing to burn the nation down. Riyaz has another axe to grind with the Mumbai Police, to avenge the death of his elder brother.DSP Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar) is the supercop with the ATS leading the Intelligence Bureau inputs. An experienced, successful and time tested policeman, Veer meticulously follows through in his swashbuckling style to thwart the destructive attempt. He isn't alone in the fightback, and is ably supported by the NSG, Singham (Ajay Devgn) and Simbba (Ranveer Singh) in this all out action adventure.The first half is absolutely stunning. It has the elements of making a well researched, credible and blindingly fast blitzkrieg that makes you sit up. The second half unfortunately has a typical Rohit Shetty film written all over it, and literally tears down, systematically, everything that the story had built up. It turns into an average Bollywood potboiler, with chest beating supercops, overflowing machismo and adrenalin, and mindless, endless action and spraying of bullets from all sorts of machines possible. Starting from NSG helicopters airlifting vehicles laden with RDX, and terrorists laying siege of the ATS headquarters blow the original content into impunity. Add to it some repetitive and jarring comedy about Akshay Kumar's ""disease"" of forgetting names, a lamenting widow's sermonising Katrina Kaif about holding the family together when the former's husband's pyre is burning and a contrived reason behind Katrina taking her young son to ""safety"" from his father make Sooryavanshi's second half rather laughable. Honestly, the serious buildup of Sooryavanshi was decimated the moment Ranveer Singh's Simbba swung into action, and then on, the film almost unstoppably hurtled downhill.",Sooryavanshi
4,sameerlodaya,entertaining,6,5 November 2021,"It is purely entertainingrohit shetty has made his type of colorful, action, thrill, mega stars, and akshay has played normally which he plays always .. Katrina is looking gorgeous and played really well..ajay and ranveer came for a delightthe story is not new but the execution is very good and is action filled followed by good background scores colorful scenes humors and super climaxdont expect and judge just get entertained on this festival.",Sooryavanshi
5,sunildaswaney-63642,AT BEST AN AVERAGE MOVIE,5,7 November 2021,"SOORYAVANSHI is a typical Rohit Shetty potboiler,low on storyline,acting,direction,editing screenplay and length. As usual there was no need for songs and an overdose of mindless action. There were many senseless scenes in the movie. However Ranveer Singh in a guest appearance was brilliant. At best judging it very liberally this film is of an average quality.5/10.",Sooryavanshi
6,eldreddsouza,One of the worst masala films I've watched in my life.,1,5 November 2021,"This has got to be the most pathetic film I ever watched. Same old formula but this time the story was too absurd. Terrorists are planning an attack in Mumbai city. Super human has to save the day. Wow, never seen that one before. Just that two more super humans from different movies have been added to assist this one fellow. Bruh, no one cares. Trying to create a Marvel type universe, with cops? Lol. Singham is old now and lacks the charm he possessed in the first film. Also he's narrating in some parts. Okay, then the other fellow is this Simmba dude. Gosh how I hate that character. I couldn't care less about his presence here. As I hated him in his independent film. That accent of his, his mannerisms are unbearable. Casting all these old actors and one new actor, it just won't work anymore. It throughout felt like these guys were forcing it too much and it just didn't come naturally. In these past two years, thanks too OTT and WFH, people have watched tonnes of meaningful cinema and are completely done with this masala crap. Masala is okay in moderation, but sticking to the same formula that worked 10-20 years ago without any thought put in writing the story, I'm sorry but it's just too stale for anyone to even care about it. This film offers nothing new. It's a weak and absurd story, stale songs, old actors doing the same old action (sorry their stunt doubles) and flying cars and stuff that will only interest kids.In conclusion, it's not worth taking the risk going to the cinema to watch this 'nothing new' movie. Stay at home, take a Netflix/prime subscription and watch meaningful cinema with your family/friends.Peace and have a good day.",Sooryavanshi
7,imdb-ikysmoviedatabase,Fun watch,5,5 November 2021,It was an awful screenplay but only the comedy made this film fun to watch. The comedy is really good story and screen play was rubbish. I walked out at ajay devgons entry ill just watch the rest of the movie on netflix next month. This movie is still worth going to for the comedy scenes.,Sooryavanshi
8,rahul000994,"Akshay Kumar In & As Sooryavanshi Is High On Style, Show And Action Thrills. Rohit Shetty Perfectly Made This For Big Screen !!!",10,6 November 2021,"Rohit Shetty has brilliantly expanded his cop universe over the years - keeping the audience engaged and die-hard fans of the genre on the edge. After the Singham series (headlined by Ajay Devgn) and then Simbaa (starring Ranveer Singh), now storms in Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar), amidst much fanfare, drama, and blaring theatrics. Sooryavanshi's character was subtly announced towards the end of Simmba. The film has all the elements, attitude, style, showmanship and heavy-duty star power expected of a Rohit Shetty offering.Similar to Simmba, even this cop action saga is narrated by Ajay Devgn, who reminds us of the several terrors attacks which Mumbai has encountered since the 1993 serial blasts to the 2008 terror attack on several landmark locations in Mumbai, including The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). The story in film unfolds as the biggest attack is yet to happen in the city, as some sleeper cells from Lashkar have been activated and it is found that 600 kilos of RDX left over from '93 serial attacks is being used for the purpose.Enter DCP Veer Sooryavanshi, with a solid mission and a lot of garam khoon to protect the city from another big attack. He is so committed towards his duty that even his family, wife Riya (Katrina Kaif) and son Aryan come second to his mighty task at hand.With the cross-border plot, the film revolves around the concept of revenge, 'An Eye For An Eye, Makes The Whole World Blind.' While the story itself plays it safe (basic and predictable), the action is risky and rousing (Rohit Shetty and Suniel Rodrigues). The chase sequence between Veer and John (Sikander Kher) on the streets of Bangkok is a visual delight.Akshay Kumar delivers a powerful, praise-worthy, knockout performance. From his seeti-worthy entry to the relentless gunshots - he justifies his super cop act. Apart from the high adrenalin physical encounters, there are umpteen high drama chases, with cars, bikes and helicopters as Akshay Kumar displays his unquestionable action skills. Overall, it's an Akshay Kumar's show all the way with his star power and screen presence looming large. Katrina Kaif looks stunning on screen and her sensual moves to the iconic song 'Tip Tip Barsa Paani' is undoubtedly clap-worthy, but you can't not think of the original 'Mast Mast' girl of Bollywood, Raveena Tandon.Ajay Devgn's and Ranvir Singh's smashing (quite literally) entry in the second half elevates the film and adds the striking punch. As Bajirao Singham and Sangram Bhalerao respectively, the three actors steal the show in the final 20 minutes of the show where they have performed together.The ensemble cast, which includes Jackie Shroff as the leader of terrorist gang Omar Afeez, as well as other group members Gulshan Grover, Abhimanyu Singh, Kumud Mishra and Nikitin Dheer, makes a substantial contribution to the plot's progression. Jaaved Jaaferi's portrayal of ATS head Kabir Shroff, on the other hand, perfectly plays his serious cop part.While the background score of Sooryavansi sets the mood, the songs are not particularly memorable. The revamped version of 'Najaa' is an earworm, but we don't get to hear it in the film. However, the trio dancing to Daler Mehndi's 'Aila Re Aillaa' is entertaining.Veer Sooryavanshi, Akshay Kumar has successfully taken over the mantle from his predecessors (Singham and Simmba), and with a generous dose of flying and somersaulting cars, this one is quite a bumper Diwali entertainer for you. And if you are a fan of high voltage action movies, go lap this up!",Sooryavanshi
9,magadalwarmayur,And the universe expands,8,5 November 2021,: I was very sceptical about this film. But Rohit Shetty and his team handled this film very gracefully.It was entertaining it had some jaw dropping action scenes and it is as witty as his previous film.This is the most realistic film Rohit Shetty has directed but all the realism goes to dustbin once Ranvir Singh (simba) arrives after that it is just another Rohit Shetty film.Akshay Kumar has done good job but the scene stealer is gulshan grover and ajay devgan even with their limited screen time.,Sooryavanshi
10,witra_as,Diwali entertainer with same old plot,6,5 November 2021,Rohit Shetty's cinematic cop universe finally happened. A Diwali entertainer with same old plot you can just sit back and watch without thinking too much. Romantic elements were forced a bit but Akshay gave knockout performance in both action and comedy aspects.,Sooryavanshi
11,pawanpunjabithewriter,"MASALA Movie : Music, Action, Stunning, Acting, Laughter, Amazing",10,5 November 2021,"Sooryavanshi was the most awaited movie in the Indian Cinema. Undoubtedly, it had a roaring start. The first thing people were in awe of was Akshay Kumar's entry. The whole theater enjoyed the movie. The BGM was another level. The stunts, the music, the action, the story kept us gripping till the end. The first half was rocking. It was all Akshay Kumar show towards the end. It has been one of my all time best theater experiences. I can't deny enjoying this movie to the greatest extent.Team Rohit Shetty has done exceptionally well. After Chennai Express, it's the second best film of Rohit Shetty equaling Singham and Golmaal I.Welxome to the Rohit Shetty's Cop Universe, Akshay Kumar's Sooryavanshi. Well deserved and Magnificent.",Sooryavanshi
12,sanjubhat,Fultu entertaining masala action thriller!!,8,6 November 2021,"Movie review: Suryavanshi
#sanjuzzreviews #SuryavanshiFinally saw a film in the theatres and that too an Akki starrer directed by Rohit Shetty.Fultu dhamaal film, lots of masala & action.Suryavanshi is a fast paced action thriller with things moving back and forth between the 1993 Mumbai blasts & present day Mumbai with terrorists planning a bigger dhamaka for the financial capital of India & it is up to super cop Akki to stop them.Awesome ensemble cast with Akshay Kumar, Javed Jaffery, Vivan Bhatena playing the good guys from the ATS . Jackie Shroff, Gulshan Grover, Kumud Mishra, Niketan Dheer & Abhimanyu Singh are the baddies in this action saga. Katrina has a small role as Akki's wife but sizzles in the ""tip tip barsa paani"" song.Ajay Devgan & Ranveer Singh make an appearance in the last 30 mins of the film and that's when things get really explosive. Ranveer in particular is superb with the righ balance of comedy and action. However Ajay Devgan hogs the limelight in the climax which was a bit surprising considering that it was an Akshay Kumar film.Overall great casting, slick editing, fabulous action scenes with a heart thumping background score which completely compliments the fast paced narrative.First big budget film to hit the cinemas this year. Watch it in theaters to see the magic of Rohit Shetty's gravity defying stunts and flying cars unfold on the 60mm screen.Dimag baju main rakh ke dekhoge to zyada enjoy karoge 😁. Don't search for logic on this film.Adios 🙂",Sooryavanshi
13,shaikhirshad-41223,Totally Disappointed.,3,7 November 2021,After Simmba I have huge expectations from Sooryavanshi because of Akshay Kumar and Rohit Shetty coming together. But the mess the director has made in this movie is a huge disappointment. Predictable old story with terrorism angle which is not a good story at all and just repeated in every typical bollywood movie. Second thing there is not a single combat action sequence that will make you satisfy. Only the second half of the movie is little bit interesting because of RANVEER SINGH and his comic punches. Otherwise whole movie is boring and dull. Just don't expect too much because it will led you a huge disappointment.Bgm is the only saving factory in this movie....,Sooryavanshi

16,grarunkumar1994,Rohit Shetty's best in the last decade.,6,6 November 2021,"The last watchable Rohit Shetty film was ""Chennai Express"" in 2013, but that was hugely thanks to SRKs charms and comic timing, which Shetty managed to ruin in Dilwale. Simba although decent is not an original work. Sooryavamshi was surprisingly entertaining with jokes that actually makes us giggle and action scenes that doesn't force Newton into depression. Honestly the hand to hand combats is one of the good ones that came out from Bollywood in recent times.Akshay, amidst all biopics, managed to do a good action film and thanks to Shetty, the scenes are pretty good.Although it was fun to see Singham and Simba since multistarrers are always a welcome idea, Ranveer Singh has reached the time where his 'pseudo hyper' behaviour has become irritating. Forgivable here since Simba is a character, but he isn't entertaining anymore.Kudos to shetty for improving the quality of film making post Dilwale and other pile of forgettable craps. If he keeps up to rational zone in stunts and comic scenes, he can very well helm a Mission impossible like film soon.Cons-
Plot is predictable
Story is cliche.Tried too hard to white wash govt moves and forced scenes on 'Hindu-Muslim' unity. Why?Akshay looks really old especially on side shots of face.Movie could ve been a bit shorter.Katrina Kaif was wasted for just 10mins of entire movie, failed to create an emotional attachment to characters.Pros-
Good action scenes on Bollywood standard.Decent CGI.Casting is real good esp Javed Jaffrey.Some jokes work.Is it bad? Not as previous shetty movies.Is it good? Maybe.It sure is entertaining.",Sooryavanshi

18,Soul_Snatcher,Bollywood's finest drivel,1,5 November 2021,"You won't have any brain cell left after watching this sham. The dance, action and acting were so cringy that would motivate you to give up completely on Bollywood. With all the controversies surrounding Bollywood of late, people have given up on it, and the Rohit Shetty films don't do any favors. As usual, if you're into brainless cringy action drama, go for it.It'd be great if Rohit Shetty stops making movies. Thanks!",Sooryavanshi

20,puranjanbasak,Sooryavanshi,9,7 November 2021,"Sooryavamshi is an action crime thriller directed by rohit shetty. Here are the positives and negatives:Performances-akshay kumar is a perfect fit for this role. He can do both comedy and intense scenes with perfect ease. To my surprise, katrina kaif has given a nice performance. Her dialogue delivery was pretty good compared to her old performances. The supporting cast is pretty good.Background score-what a brilliant background score!! You can literally feel the thump in your heart whenever the title theme plays in the background. Especially, the entry sequemces of the three superstars is epic.Sound mixing-one of the finest sound mixing i have ever seen. Mixing the gunshots with background music is a pretty tough job and they have done it superbly. Impressive!!Antagonists-when the team of antagonists include stalwarts like jackie shroff, kumud mishra, gulshan grover and all you have to know they are not leaving it easy. A perfect team of antagonists.If you try to find logic in it you are searching for the wrong notes. Go to the theatres, enjoy the film and entertain yourselves. This is a proper mass entertainer.

21,Kaatil29,Typical masala,4,8 November 2021,"Watched sooryavanshi yesterdayMy review: the film had no new element, same remake songs, same indo-pak rivalry & jokes that are not at all funny. In my opinion whole movie is forced just to announce Singham 3. Rohit sir we know your love for ajay sir but this is not the way.Most disappointing thing is the song 'Tip tip barsa paani' there was never a need for this song in the film. Singham's entry was too hyped but couldn't deliver upto the mark, Although i enjoyed simmba's comedy, it was not needed in the climax scene.The only good thing about the film was the temple scene, where the Hindu-muslims harmony can be scene. The bangkok chase scene was just not needed.. they should learn from 'DON 2' how to present a good chase scene. Although i didn't liked the film, my friends loved it.I can totally understand why they loved the film. Its not a good sensible movie but can be enjoyed with friends & family. A typical mass entertainer for audiences who love to whistle in theatres. Katrina's acting was pathetic, it's been 19 years and she still can't act.Akshay kumar can't even cry perfectly, he's just made for comedy movies and he should stick to that. Have seen every akshay kumar films and can say for sure he can't cry in screen. First half was very slow & dull, never for once felt excited before interval. 2nd half was decent.Overall it's a decent one time watch for mass audience and everyone should watch it once to support our theatres & bollywood. Expected more from Rohit sir but it's okay he is also human. Waiting for Singham 3 and hope it will not disappoint us.My ranking (4/10)",Sooryavanshi
22,sanjeevanwar,Singham overpowered Sooryavanshee,5,5 November 2021,"Anwar Says : While watching the trailer, I thought it would be a perfect Diwali Dhamaka , but the expectations shattered. Once again you have '93 Mumbai Blast , Sleeper Cell , Lashkar , RDx and across the border terrorism and Rohit Shetty's another introduction to Cop Universe - Akshay Kumar .Rohit's love for Mumbai Police World is well known and he has hinted another one. He has refused to change his winning formula but Akshay was neither Singham nor Simba and even the climax action has been stolen by Singham . Rohit should realise that the audience are much more mature in the Pandemic after watching some true and real life action on OTT .Acting wise Akshay always looks a real cop right from KHAKI days . Watching Katrina was like watching her in Salman starrer Bharat, probably both the movies were shot simultaneously, hardly adds anything to the story, which she was capable of , except the Tip Tip Barsa Pani song bringing nostalgia and the memories of Raveena. One chase sequence at Bangkok to get Sikandar Khan was beautifully captured though must be inspired from some Hollywood movie. Gulshan Grover, Jackie Shroff etc. Did nothing much to mention. VFX is poor, Shetty might have changed his computer guy . Background score as usual very loud .My rating is 2.5/5 , now you have to decide whether you want to keep it in 100, 200 or 400 crore Club .#Sooryavanshi #anwarsays #movie2021 #RohitShetty #AkshayKumar #KatrinaKaif #copstory

Each every second is worth it, the way Akshaykumar done humor along with all the fantastic action scenes that's worth watch! His Helicopter stunt probably his best scene in the movie. Chemistry between Akshay & Katrinakaif in Tip Tip that was exceptionally sizeling & the final 30 mins of Sooryavanshi, Singham & Simbha reunion that's the blast! One of the best Indian movie I watched in theatres after long long time. The concept of this movie is the best among all the cop universe. For me it's best Movie among all the cop universe movie. Now @itsrohitshetty can create our Indian Cop Avengers. All the supporting actors done really well. Complete Paisa Wasool. Definitely a must watch movie in the theatres! #AkshayKumar

A group of sleeper cells had been in disguise in our country and waiting for an opportunity to give an another blow and to stop this ATS officer Veer Sooryavanshi and his team is on a mission for an total elimination.....Story is not new as from Holiday, Uri , Bollywood had portrayed that how terrorism adversely impact us and how the unsung heroes have fought for us not caring of their lifeWhen talking about the performance....1) Akshay Kumar had given an action packed experience after Rowdy Rathore and it became a paisa vassol movie......2) Ranveer Singh and Ajay Devgn had energized the movie by coming at the climax thereby giving end credits....3) Jackie Shroff reminds me of his character in Mission Kashmir, but screen space had not given much for him...He was an OK performer4) Katrina Kaif, glamour glamour glamourWhen it comes to Rohit Shetty action choreography, story and direction.....1) He always delivers larger than life movies, be it singham or simbha and we have to just keep away logic as his only logic is entertainment & this movie is a perfect example for it....2) Action designed by him are well done except for the VFX which has brought up the artificiallity in some action sequences but BGM was able to negate that...3) Converting a routine terrorism based story into a entertainer is pat on back for Rohit Shetty......4) By appropriate dialogues, "" Passport dekhe nahi, criminal record dekhar thok deti Hein"" , a form of disclaimer that this movie had not made to hurt any religious sentiments, another smart move of the director.....5) Star cast perfect except for the heroine......6) Didn't able to feel the lagness through out the movieOverall an worthy watch as it didn't gone waste for waiting this movie for 1.5 years.....",Sooryavanshi

This was a really good entertaining Masala film. Nothing new, story was predictable but what makes this movie entertaining is the way it is presented to us. Rohit Shetty is a director who knows the exact technique of how to entertain the audience, if you look at his previous films, they have never brought anything new on screen but the way those films are presented on screen makes them very entertaining and that is what this film does. Ranveer remains one of the highlights of the film, no matter you hate him or you like him but you cannot ignore him. Also the whole climax remains the highlights of the film and not to forget the chase scene in Bangkok...superbly done...I was also amazed with the superb camera work done in the climax scene, overall a must watch if you are looking for entertainment.",Sooryavanshi

Knowing that the same actor has done a crazy thriller such as Baby, makes it more torturous. You on various occasions think, did Akshay not find it ridiculous..??Old 90s movie just made in 2019.

This film was touted as the one getting audiences back into the theatres, but what a disappointment. Same old Pakistan bashing.Katrina Kaif as usual is an accessory heroine and adds absolutely no value. Im addition she destroys a classic song ( where is the originality of sognwriters?). She's a -4 when rated out of 10.The only bright spots in the movie are probably the scenes with Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh. The movie picks up post Ranveer's entry and Ranveer's brilliance carries it throughI wonder if these ""Established Actors"" actually read and study all aspects of the movie before signing them.My rating is only for Ranveer Singh's part and that of Ajay Degvn's.",Sooryavanshi

Common man, enjoy the diwali with your family with such a good masala entertainment movie.I'm just reducing 1 star for the vfx part if there are so many producers involved then also getting this level of vfx is not acceptable.But beside that whole movie is enjoyable to action lovers, masala movie lovers and also it has some blend of nationalism and humanity. Perfectly driven story, build up of every main characters arc
So the waiting part for the last 1 and half year was worthwhile.Perfect movie to be watched in cinemas only

Rest all rohit shetty movies are utter crap.Positives - Only when the 3 heros combine at the end, the movie feels really good.Negative - Quite a few. To start with plastic expressions Katrina Kaif. No change in her facial behaviors whatsoever. Just watch the sad scenes in the movie and you shall be able to relate to what I want to say.2> Unnecessary comic timings in a serious situation, no issues with that though but the execution was not at all up to the standards.3> Songs are a big let down and were not actually required in this movie.4> Unnecessary love angle which does not fit at all in the flow.5> Lots of other issues which you will see when you watch it.All in all, masala entertainer but not worth the ticket prices that people will pay across India.I am sure all the fans like me will still go to theatres and fill in the banks of these already super rich people but take a word of advise, save the money and do something that you love.If you are still loyal to Rohit shetty and the bunch of actors, pls go to a normal theatre and save the hard earned bucks because you can never expect any returns from Bolly mafia :)One time watch in theatres (If you wanna make them rich)

272,tkmce2008,Rohit Sherry's Cop Universe needs work but Akshay Kumar shines bright as Sooryavanshi!,7,7 November 2021,"The wait has been pretty long. Fans like me have been dying to watch the first (Indian) cinematic universe come together since March 2020. And has the wait been worth it? It has for Akshay Kumar's character but not so much for the trio; which is why I left the theatre less enthusiastic than I entered it.Veer Sooryavanshi is a part the Anti-Terrorist Squad. His team has been trying to track down 600kgs of explosives that was buried someplace in India after the 1993 blasts. When they arrest a sleeper cell agent, a chain of events unfold potentially putting the nation in danger.Akshay Kumar returns as Veer Sooryavanshi after his character was teased at the end of Simmba. Akshay's police avatar is the most believable of the lot (among the three) given that he performs most of his stunts and they are less over the top. Also, it is always a delight to watch him onscreen especially when he seems committed to the role. Co-star Katrina Kaif doesn't have much to do (that was a given). Ranveer Singh & Ajay Devgn, who reprise their roles from Simmba & Singham enter the film only during the climax. This doesn't give the trio sufficient time to bond and their scenes feel rushed. Would have loved to see more of them together. Devgn also explicitly announces Singham 3.This is the first film in the Shetty cop universe that has an original story. And this works in the film's favour to an extent (better than the other three). But the plot is mostly the same: old- terrorists with unfinished business, religious divide, the hero preaching to anyone who will hear & some harmless work banter. Nevertheless, it is a mass entertainer and it is the perfect excuse to return to the theatres.",Sooryavanshi

372,niazijeelani,Only watch if u r looking for brainless movie,1,5 November 2021,Just watched sooryavanshi in the morning show . I was eagerly waiting for this movie over a year and finally yes today it got released. Movie starts well with good visuals . The director introduced all the characters in starting of 15 minutes and builded a base for the second half. The first half started well but going on it could make you feel bore in some scenes and the first half will be end with a mass interval . The second half is so gripping that you won't know how the film has been completed. Akshay kumar and Katrin kaif scenes are well developed and asusuall Ranveer singh and Ajay Devagn completely pulled their characters .The drawback of the film is songs. I think there is no need of having songs in this film . Except Aila re Aila . This song is a eye feast for all Akshay kumar fans . The highlight of the film is Background score which totally makes you get goosebumps in action sequence.The story is quite old but the execution and development is good . Overall you can watch a perfect movie with your family for this festive season.,Sooryavanshi

There is a quote that says, ""form is temporary, but class is permanent"". Exactly my point in the case of Katrina kaif. What an actor she is! Nothing can replace her in her form.35. I was left stunned by the acting of Katrina kaif. Seriously this girl has so much to offer to the Indian Cinema. It feels great to have her in our squad with such storylines.36. Timing is the key for a story to develop and imprint on the audience. Akshay kumar has stolen that timing and cracked it. The concept was amazing to see and an outstanding piece of work by the writers.37. Cinematographers, please take my bow down! A film that left everyone shut. A picture that accumulates small and big actors that performed to their best. Picture Perfect!38. Fine-tuning of t talents with old versions of experienced actors. I loved the chemistry of Katrina and Akki. A spiced movie to binge-watch!39. It is a movie that made me emotional, though I am not an individual who gets emotional so easily. Every scene depicts a mixture of happiness, struggle, dedication, and motivation.40. Fabulous starcast with an amazing storyline. Katrina has done amazing work and her transformation has gone to the next level. What a dedication towards work.41. Creating such a wonderful concept based on facts and then shortlisting proper actors and actresses for it is a tough task done by Rohit shetty. My personal favourite!42. Speechless! I mean so many artists on one stage acting in a film that has a mixture of emotions, dedication, inspiration, and motivation. Altogether a movie to watch! Please watch Sooryavanshi.43. Stellar performances by the stage actors. I am overwhelmed by the emotional acting by everyone in some scenes that gave a touch of struggle. It recollected my days of struggle.44. Picture Perfect I would say! Amazing star cast and technical department who have got the perfect vision from the director Rohit Shetty and have led this film to success.45. Best movie that shows how to fight for your rights and stay above all the odds of your life. I loved watching Katrina kaif for her dedication and transformation.46. Great influential characters that depicted every character in a very creative way. Best movie I have watched with my family and going to watch it again with my friends. Classic!47. A film that inspires you to the next level. I urge everyone to watch this movie as Sooryavanshi has a fantastic conceptualization and direction that has made it a binge-watch.48. OMG! Akshay kumar is looking so handsome. I cannot forget the view of his actions in the whole movie. Many scenes including the police station ones are different from the acting.49. Please watch this movie guys! It's a request to all of you. You will never get such a storyline with these actors again altogether in the same movie. Give it a watch.50. A movie that shook to the core. Please watch this movie guys. I recommend Rashmi Rocket as it has every emotion that we as an audience need in a film. Rohit, you are a gem!",Sooryavanshi

621,inam-34231,Sooryavanshi,10,6 November 2021,"Finally something for the theatre owners to cheer about. Also for us, the audience!!The first major Bollywood theatrical release since March 2020 (Baaghi 3 was the major release just before Corona struck us); Sooryavanshi can be called an ideal festive dhamaka to pull back the audience to cinema halls which have sadly, been shut or running empty since then...Rohit Shetty's cop universe extends to Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar), an ATS officer, who along with Singham (Devgn) and Simmba (Ranveer) take on the terror group (Jackie Shroff and company) planning to blow up Mumbai once again. À la March 1993.Akshay is in top form again after Bell Bottom (2021) and the Bangkok action stunts are a treat to watch reminding us of his daredevilry in Sabse Bada Khiladi (1995). Katrina Kaif, playing his wifey, sizzles the screen in the remixed 'Tip tip barsa paani' number from Mohra (1994) though I preferred Raveena's sensuous jhatkas from the original. Yea, the plot is typical '90s stuff but cleverly updated to present times.Infact, the first half is a breeze watch with all the action, emotions and drama unfolding at a super fast pace. Rohit even brings a secular touch in a particular scene where Muslims help Hindus to take Ganpati idol from Mandir to a safe place in course of a terror strike even as a remixed ""Chodo kal ki baatein...Hum Hindustani"" song plays in the background. Pop bhaichara, indeed!!Post interval, the film dithers and withers a bit as the screenplay appears to be in a tearing hurry to introduce its two main cameo characters - you know who!!Ranveer Singh and Ajay Devgn make their grand entry and then, Shetty completely lets the action department take charge. Which ain't a bad decision at all as the stunts are imaginatively executed. Notably, the continous shot of Ranveer bashing up a dirty dozen is superb. Taalimaar!!The dialogues are massy, the technical aspects are okey dokey and the end finale promises to carry forward the franchise with a Singham sequel. Clearly, the focus is to entertain. Nothing more. Nothing less. And that is important...in the current times when audience hasn't been to theatres since early 2020. In that sense, Sooryavanshi truly achieves its objective. And thats why it should be seen. Only in theatres please!!",Sooryavanshi
622,imteshalmik,Great for a Diwali action flick,7,6 November 2021,"Bang for buck entertainment!Story and direction were great and as always, Rohit Shetty's stunts featured big here and very well upgraded in terms of scale of the said stunts.The plot was tight and narrative, though with a few potholes. Story was very well thought of and executed well enough in script. One need not dig too deep into the story to find flaws, the purpose of this movie was seat-edged action and it delivers it fabulously.Yet, one only part that bothered me was a very misplaced romantic song played right on cue during a time when the plot was thick with seriousness.Overall, it was a great joy to watch.Diwali celebratory fireworks was this movie.",Sooryavanshi

771,ry-47637,After watched movie in cinema hall my reaction,10,7 November 2021,": Too much emotion sidetracks Akshay Kumar-Rohit Shetty's cop drama
Premium
Sooryavanshi movie review: Too much emotion sidetracks Akshay Kumar-Rohit Shetty's cop dramaSooryavanshi movie review: It is only when the trio of Akshay Kumar, Ranveer Singh and Ajay Devgn come together, the Rohit Shetty movie gives us what it promises, three for the price of one.Ten minutes into Sooryavanshi, we know we are back in Rohit Shetty's cop universe. RDX! Cars being blown up! And our Hero Ki Entry as Veer Sooryvanshi (Akshay Kumar), the best of Mumbai police, slo mo-ing into the frame, crisp khakis and snappy Raybans to the fore, gearing up to fight the Bad Guys aka Lashkar aka Muslim Terrorists.Good guys. Bad guys. Maratha pride. Aaaaand action. There really is no need for anything else in Planet Shetty, but given that the dewlaps under Sooryavanshi's chin are clearly visible, a semblance of a plot is handed out as a prop: 1000 kgs of deadly explosives were brought into India in 1993 and only 400 kgs were used in the Mumbai blasts, so where is the remaining? Our brave cop is also given a beauteous wife (Katrina Kaif), a child, and a song-and-dance-in-the-rain sequence, just to pad up the two-and-a-half hours of run time. The rest is given over to Terrorist Chief (Jackie Shroff) master-minding a repeat of the 1993 blasts, and a sleeper cell which is dog whistled into action. 'Khabardaar, Mumbai phir se khatre mein hain!'",Sooryavanshi
772,djmitra,Movie is overall ver good,9,6 November 2021,"The movie is overall very good with action and comedy scenes , The best part of the movie is the background music beat played during action scenes .....",Sooryavanshi
773,asharma-50991,Nice,9,6 November 2021,Best movie Sooryavanshi has been a tremendous movie to watch with your family. Every scene has a fan base that gives you an emotional touch and lets your mind stick to those scenes.,Sooryavanshi

777,sushjen,Outdated story with overacting dose,5,7 November 2021,"Stunts performed when not required. When content is not so strong then Rohit shetty is ready with his car crashing scenes, he needs to contain himself in comedy genre films only. Hats off to Katrina for her acting, as there is no change in his facial expressions be it her 1st film or 50th film. Climax is so annoying, when there were 40 sleeper cells attacked ATS office but Akshay, Ranveer n Ajay able to kill 95 of them. Go watch this movie if you are away from cinema since 2 years but forget to take your dimaag to theatre.Complete mess of a outdated movie.",Sooryavanshi
778,roysdr-12816,Best movie,9,5 November 2021,Class performances by everyone in the movie. The belief of making something very interesting was performed well. I think everyone should watch this movie again and again. Best action movie.,Sooryavanshi

781,farahshroff,One of the worst movies of this decade,1,7 November 2021,A pathetic storyline clubbed with shoddy acting makes Sooryavanshi one of the worst movies of this decade. Total waste of time and money. Akshay Kumar at his worst.,Sooryavanshi
782,chintuakash-47765,Unnecessarily dragging the movie,3,7 November 2021,"Really didn't expect to see such type of movie after 2 years of lockdown.Rohit shetty should have come up with the idea of copying the movie just like he does rather then making an actual original script. Director and script failed to utilize the full potential of Akshay even the main villain at the end of the film were having combat only with Ajay. There was no thriller, comedy came into the scene with the entry of Ranveer or else it was just PJ'S of Akshay through out the movie. Over all its a disaster to watch.",Sooryavanshi
783,zarayasin,Not even a 1 time watch a no watch,1,5 November 2021,"Very general nothing new. Unrealistic action, dialogues from supporting characters seemed dubbed. The movie was very anti Pakistan. Named lots of different terrorist lots of different Muslim names as though from a Muslim name book. Jokes were crude and unfunny. Female lead hardly had a strong role or much screen time as in most Rohit Shetty films. Plot was predictable indian cops vs Pakistani terrorists which has been done a million times. Rohit Shetty movies are getting bad to worse as are his comedic references as each movies passes by. I left at the interval thats how terrible it was. Waste of money, pointless, robotic and divisive. Why do opposite countries have to always be enemies why can't they be portrayed as friends instead of us vs them. Ridiculous and horrible. Not worth the watch.",Sooryavanshi
784,bongb-83405,Good movie,10,7 November 2021,"The ensemble cast, which includes Jackie Shroff as the leader of terrorist gang Omar Afeez, as well as other group members Gulshan Grover, Abhimanyu Singh, Kumud Mishra and Nikitin Dheer, makes a substantial contribution to the plot's progression. Jaaved Jaaferi's portrayal of ATS head Kabir Shroff, on the other hand, perfectly plays his serious cop part.",Sooryavanshi

Great screenplay, superb actors, inspiring Background Score, Power pack direction and mind blowing Action, Natural and situational comedy.

786,smsatbhai,TYPICAL ROHIT SHETTY CAR BASHING SAGA,6,7 November 2021,"First of all, perfect Bollywood masala movie to pull crowd for a theatrical release.Positives -
1. Akshay Kumar has aced the portrayal of a superhumanly police/army/intelligence officer in typical big budget patriotic/cop movies, hence he nails the role of ATS officer Veer Sooryavanshi.2. Well paced story line and very few unnecessary sub plots.3. Adrenaline pumping background score specially during chase sequences, goosebumps can be felt.4. Effective communication of communal unity, patriotism at multiple instances.5. Worthy acting by supporting cast and antagonists.Negatives -
1. Poor comic timing and overacting by Ranveer Singh. Why on earth a cop would crack PJ while diffusing RDX explosive about to burst in 1 min. ???2. Unnecessary sub plot of Sooryavanshi's love life. To be honest, the love story adds nothing to main plot and serves no purpose in pacing the track of movie.3. Illogical action and chase sequences which defy all laws of nature. Rohit Shetty needs a mature approach to direct action as audience are not living in 2010.Summary -
Decent one time watch provided you don't think too much about logic.Just chill, relax and enjoy the adrenaline rush !!!",Sooryavanshi

And if you are a fan of high voltage action movies, go lap this up!The film revolves around the concept of revenge, 'An eye for an eye, makes the world blind.' While the story itself plays it safe (basic and predictable), the action is risky and rousing (Rohit Shetty and Suniel Rodrigues). The sequence where Akshay is chasing John (Sikander Kher) is a visual delight.Akshay Kumar delivers a knockout performance. From his seeti-worthy entry to the relentless gunshots -- he justifies her super cop act. Apart from the high adrenalin physical encounters there are umpteen high drama chases, with cars, bikes and helicopters as Akshay Kumar displays his unquestionable action skills.

1076,rockybai-32048,Mass Movie,10,6 November 2021,"Hero of the movie is Akshay Kumar. Category belongs to Mass, thriller movie. Heroines chemistry is also to good and hot/sexy. I'm so glad I kicked off my diwali on a dhamakedar 💥 note with #Sooryavanshi , great plot , action choreography especially in the climax is really great , lot of nicely choreographed shootout & combat sequences , the music too especially the thumping background music felt great to hear in the theater & #KatrinaKaif surprises in a really awesome attention grabbing , superbly & sensually performed dance moves in a really nice updated version of #TipTipBarsaPani . The character , plot driven moments as well as the emotional & humorous moments are really nice & nicely balanced . It also makes an attempt at tugging at your anti terrorism & religious sentiments & rightfully succeeds in that department . Entire supporting cast including @GulshanGroverGG & others really make an impact with whatever screen time
them . Nice 1st half even better 2nd half as the ATS are in a race against time to diffuse a bunch bombs . The presence of Singham & Simba in the climax is nicely weaved & is a moneyshot moment that elevates the concluding portions of the movie . Singham's brief standalone moment in the climax is really nice which is a teaser to #Singham3 . This is @iamrohitshetty 's best movie yet I wonder how he'll top it off in the next installment of the universe looking forward to it. Thank you.",Sooryavanshi
1077,rockybai-32048,Mass and thriller movie,10,6 November 2021,"Men in Khakhi are back and so is Rohit shetty style of films. The plot is about how Police under Akshay Kumar tries to save the whole city which is under the threat of terrorist trying to bomb it. First half is decent enough but action begins in second half and especially last 20 mins when Ranveer Singh , Ajay Devgn & Akshay Kumar comes together. One thing is for sure when Ajay Devgn comes on screen no one can match it's aura or charisma even Akshay Kumar looks pani kum chai. Cinematography is fabulous and so is the thumping background score. Songs could have been avoided as there was no need for it. Comedy could have been better , Akshay kumar literally fails in his comic timings as a police officer but Ranveer singh does fabulous for the same. After long time saw Gulshan Grover and it was good, though was for a small time only. There are two best scenes in the movie, the one in which religious sentiments are very pleasantly shown without disrespecting any one faith at the end & other being Ajay Devgn's entry. The presence of Simmba & Singham at climax is superbly presented and is worth watching the trio take on the terrorists. Katrina Kaif is purely a miss in the movie, nothing much significant for her to do. It is typical ROHIT SHETTY film and yes you can call it a MASALA BLOCKBUSTER movie, which people would prefer to see post pandemic in theatres after 2 years of fear & stress thanks to covid. Enjoy the movie without trying to find flaws in it. Enjoy and remain stress free.",Sooryavanshi

It has the elements of making a well researched, credible and blindingly fast blitzkrieg that makes you sit up. The second half unfortunately has a typical Rohit Shetty film written all over it, and literally tears down, systematically, everything that the story had built up. It turns into an average Bollywood potboiler, with chest beating supercops, overflowing machismo and adrenalin, and mindless, endless action and spraying of bullets from all sorts of machines possible. Starting from NSG helicopters airlifting vehicles laden with RDX, and terrorists laying siege of the ATS headquarters blow the original content into impunity.

The 1st half is slow at setting up the plot while the 2nd half is purely action driven. The last 30 mins is an 'explosive' climax. Akshay Kumar is the megastar throughout. Jackie Shroff, Kumud Mishra & Gulshan Grover play their parts really well. Katrina Kaif was a bit lacking. Kudos to Rohit Shetty for executing the climax fight and the battles he fought off-screen. The background music suited the well choreographed action. The plot was decent, too.

1135,malti-07670,I booked,10,8 November 2021,"Booked first day first show as I was going in the theatres after almost 2 years and let me tell u that the money that I spent for sooryavanshi was worth it. Seriously this was the best film of Rohit Shetty and even better Singham. It was comedy , action , thriller and the things that was needed for entertainment. It was a normal Rohit Shetty film with an expected story and in each movie it's the same but the best thing about his films r that it is predictable but the way they show it is very amazing. It's a one time watch for me and I will request u also to watch this film as it is a super duper film. It will be a blockbuster film. It will make ur Diwali more enjoyable. But the only bad part bout this movie is Katrina Kaif's overacting. She was taking overacting to another level in this movie but when u see her dance in tip tip Basra Palani 2.0 u will feel that she is the best dancer even better than Prabhu deva.

I liked the way askshay kumar acts and some funny things like he keeps on forgetting everyones name(in character) I liked ranveer and ajay sir's entry and ranveer singh did awesome acting and comedy . I think that singham 3 will come and the villain will be jackie shroff (of course) if there was a 10 rating the i would have given but anyways 5 is okay .I think that the way they showed that muslims helping hindus bringing lord ganesha safe showed how humanity can be .

1617,luckyboyzzz-18666,Action getting better of content,10,7 November 2021,"Sooryavanshi starts off with the right intent, pace, narrative and sentiment. The backdrop is the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai, and the masterminds giving the cops a slip, but leaving a live imprint behind - if 400 kg RDX were used for the blasts, where are the remaining 600 kg? Fast forward to 2007, 40 Lashkar operatives from Pakistan sneak into India and commerce sleeper cells all around the country, awaiting instructions from the chief Omar Hafeez (Jackie Shroff) to start another siege. Advance to the current day, Bilal (Kumud Mishra) the key mastermind of the 1993 blast returns to India via Maldives, releasing the cache of the 600 kg RDX from an inconspicuous house in Sawantwadi, and activates the sleeper cells, under the leadership of Riyaz Hafeez, Omar's son, swearing to burn the nation down. Riyaz has another axe to grind with the Mumbai Police, to avenge the death of his elder brother.DSP Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar) is the supercop with the ATS leading the Intelligence Bureau inputs. An experienced, successful and time tested policeman, Veer meticulously follows through in his swashbuckling style to thwart the destructive attempt. He isn't alone in the fightback, and is ably supported by the NSG, Singham (Ajay Devgn) and Simbba (Ranveer Singh) in this all out action adventure.The first half is absolutely stunning. It has the elements of making a well researched, credible and blindingly fast blitzkrieg that makes you sit up. The second half unfortunately has a typical Rohit Shetty film written all over it, and literally tears down, systematically, everything that the story had built up. It turns into an average Bollywood potboiler, with chest beating supercops, overflowing machismo and adrenalin, and mindless, endless action and spraying of bullets from all sorts of machines possible. Starting from NSG helicopters airlifting vehicles laden with RDX, and terrorists laying siege of the ATS headquarters blow the original content into impunity. Add to it some repetitive and jarring comedy about Akshay Kumar's ""disease"" of forgetting names, a lamenting widow's sermonising Katrina Kaif about holding the family together when the former's husband's pyre is burning and a contrived reason behind Katrina taking her young son to ""safety"" from his father make Sooryavanshi's second half rather laughable. Honestly, the serious buildup of Sooryavanshi was decimated the moment Ranveer Singh's Simbba swung into action, and then on, the film almost unstoppably hurtled downhill.",Sooryavanshi

Akshay is in top form again after Bell Bottom (2021). Ranveer Singh and Ajay Devgn make their grand entry and then, Shetty completely lets the action department take charge.

1662,tahirzargham,Nice,10,10 November 2021,"Sooryavanshi starts off with the right intent, pace, narrative and sentiment. The backdrop is the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai, and the masterminds giving the cops a slip, but leaving a live imprint behind - if 400 kg RDX were used for the blasts, where are the remaining 600 kg? Fast forward to 2007, 40 Lashkar operatives from Pakistan sneak into India and commerce sleeper cells all around the country, awaiting instructions from the chief Omar Hafeez (Jackie Shroff) to start another siege. Advance to the current day, Bilal (Kumud Mishra) the key mastermind of the 1993 blast returns to India via Maldives, releasing the cache of the 600 kg RDX from an inconspicuous house in Sawantwadi, and activates the sleeper cells, under the leadership of Riyaz Hafeez, Omar's son, swearing to burn the nation down. Riyaz has another axe to grind with the Mumbai Police, to avenge the death of his elder brother.DSP Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar) is the supercop with the ATS leading the Intelligence Bureau inputs. An experienced, successful and time tested policeman, Veer meticulously follows through in his swashbuckling style to thwart the destructive attempt. He isn't alone in the fightback, and is ably supported by the NSG, Singham (Ajay Devgn) and Simbba (Ranveer Singh) in this all out action adventure.The first half is absolutely stunning. It has the elements of making a well researched, credible and blindingly fast blitzkrieg that makes you sit up. The second half unfortunately has a typical Rohit Shetty film written all over it, and literally tears down, systematically, everything that the story had built up. It turns into an average Bollywood potboiler, with chest beating supercops, overflowing machismo and adrenalin, and mindless, endless action and spraying of bullets from all sorts of machines possible. Starting from NSG helicopters airlifting vehicles laden with RDX, and terrorists laying siege of the ATS headquarters blow the original content into impunity. Add to it some repetitive and jarring comedy about Akshay Kumar's ""disease"" of forgetting names, a lamenting widow's sermonising Katrina Kaif about holding the family together when the former's husband's pyre is burning and a contrived reason behind Katrina taking her young son to ""safety"" from his father make Sooryavanshi's second half rather laughable. Honestly, the serious buildup of Sooryavanshi was decimated the moment Ranveer Singh's Simbba swung into action, and then on, the film almost unstoppably hurtled downhill.",Sooryavanshi

1684,technologicaldude,If this pleases indian audiences then bollywood is hopeless,1,5 November 2021,"The movie throws logic out of the window. Sometimes even by the movie's logic, the characters don't perform actions and just patiently watch things go south while having shocked faces. Also, there are so many instances where they spoon feed you the story as if we suffer from short term memory loss.Example:
If there is a bomb scene, they'll first play a flashback to a previous scene that already occurred to remind you of the bomb. You remember this person mentioned it right? That's what this is. It's the same bomb. Did I mention it's the same bomb?If there is a scene when the person is about to kill themselves with a gun in slow motion, the cops will just wait in slow motion instead of shooting the hand of the victim. Are they trained cops or have they never seen something like this before?If a dialogue is weak and meant to be powerful, they'll put music over it and it is very clear that the writing is lazy. The music does not save the scenes. You can see the laziness.Even the songs are recycled from old films. I appreciate that they did not change it but there is nothing unique and fresh about the songs.Also, the main hero's theme just keeps repeating the movie's title a million times over the same tune. At least add some uniqueness and some words rather that looping a short track. Singham had that so why not Sooryavanshi? I might have gone insane and left the cinema if I hear ""Soooooryavanshi..."" one more time.The main story is generic and there is nothing exciting except for some instances. There are very convenient plot devices that come out of no where for the sake of moving the movie forward.Examples
A random guy just suddenly sees the terrorists. Of course he does. How else will these trained cops win?It randomly starts raining in a scene to remind the characters about their past. It is so random that I can imagine Rohit Shetty on the set going ""Now!"" to trigger a shower head from above.This movie could have been so much more. Even the Avengers don't follow real life logic, but at least it forms it's own and uses that to its advantage.",Sooryavanshi

They have amazing Hollywood movies.Sarfarosh is one of the best cop movie ever made n it is very realistic, gripping n gritty.The cops in Sarfarosh/Bullit/The French Connection doesn't hang around in helicopters n defy physics.Coming back to this movie, there is nothing redeemable in this movie.Basically its a poor man's Michael Bay movies rip off.Ranveer Singh's character gets on ur nerves with his accent n body movements.So much overacting man.Akshay's character is totally unbelievable n anti physics.His walks, his mannerisms n body language doesn't look like that of a cop.I dont know how Devgn got trapped into this abysmal movie.Some of the 80s Hollywood action movies are much better than this lousy movie.",Sooryavanshi

2104,chdi-94841,"Amazing Movie : Music, Action, Stunning, Acting, Laughter, Amazing",10,6 November 2021,"Team Rohit Shetty has done exceptionally well. After Chennai Express, it's the second best film of Rohit Shetty equaling Singham and Golmaal I. Akshay Kumar delivers a powerful, praise-worthy, knockout performance. From his seeti-worthy entry to the relentless gunshots - he justifies his super cop act. Apart from the high adrenalin physical encounters, there are umpteen high drama chases, with cars, bikes and helicopters as Akshay Kumar displays his unquestionable action skills. Overall, it's an Akshay Kumar's show all the way with his star power and screen presence looming large. Katrina Kaif looks stunning on screen and her sensual moves to the iconic song 'Tip Tip Barsa Paani' is undoubtedly clap-worthy, but you can't not think of the original 'Mast Mast' girl of Bollywood, Raveena Tandon. While the background score of Sooryavansi sets the mood, the songs are not particularly memorable. The revamped version of 'Najaa' is an earworm, but we don't get to hear it in the film. However, the trio dancing to Daler Mehndi's 'Aila Re Aillaa' is entertaining..",Sooryavanshi

2240,ms-26893,Sooryavanshi,10,7 November 2021,"Sooryavanshi has been awaited since 2018 when Veer Sooryavanshi made a surprise entry in Rohit Shetty's Cop-Universe. In the climax scene of 'Simmba', it was clear that Akshay Kumar's Veer Sooryanashi isn't going to be the same cop we have seen before. He was supposed to be different from 'Singham' and 'Simmba' and after watching Sooryavanshi, it is confirmed. An interesting thing to note here is, Veer Sooryavanshi is a combo of both the Super Cops- Singham and Simmba. He is intense like Singham and at the same time he is funny & quirky like Simbba. Rohit Shetty gambles smartly with the idea of bringing together these three super cops in a mainstream entertainer and he adds couple of strong motives like Hindu-Muslim unity and a mandatory glorification of all the heroes in uniform who serve us day and night.",Sooryavanshi

Jackie Shroff, Gulshan Grover, Javed Jaffrey, Abhimanyu Singh, Kumud Mishra and Rajendra GuptaKatrina Kaif doesn't have an interesting role, except the rain song, which is well choreographed
Ajay Devgn has a small cameo and have his own moment in the climax, which can be taken as a teaser for Singham 3

From his seeti-worthy entry to the relentless gunshots - he justifies his super cop act. Apart from the high adrenalin physical encounters, there are umpteen high drama chases, with cars, bikes and helicopters as Akshay Kumar displays his unquestionable action skills.Ajay Devgn's and Ranvir Singh's smashing (quite literally) entry in the second half elevates the film and adds the striking punch. As Bajirao Singham and Sangram Bhalerao respectively, the three actors steal the show in the few scenes they have together.Hope it will make a very positive impact on society.

Rohit Shetty has made a perfect selection of Rohit Shetty for this role as without her, no one would have played it in such a manner.31. Stunning performances by everyone! The cast and crew with the dialogue delivery and the storyline was just a match made in heaven. I couldn't resist my binge-watching habit.32. Great work by Akshay kumar. He looks like a big personality who has a proper hold in the association. But all together with a fine storyline with some important facts to be shown on national television.33. The finest actors collaborated to work in a single picture, a mixture of young and old talent has given everyone enjoyment and motivation to fight back the odds.34. There is a quote that says, ""form is temporary, but class is permanent"". Exactly my point in the case of Katrina kaif. What an actor she is! Nothing can replace her in her form.35. I was left stunned by the acting of Katrina kaif. Seriously this girl has so much to offer to the Indian Cinema. It feels great to have her in our squad with such storylines.36. Timing is the key for a story to develop and imprint on the audience. Akshay kumar has stolen that timing and cracked it. The concept was amazing to see and an outstanding piece of work by the writers.37. Cinematographers, please take my bow down! A film that left everyone shut. A picture that accumulates small and big actors that performed to their best. Picture Perfect!38. Fine-tuning of t talents with old versions of experienced actors. I loved the chemistry of Katrina and Akki. A spiced movie to binge-watch!39. It is a movie that made me emotional, though I am not an individual who gets emotional so easily. Every scene depicts a mixture of happiness, struggle, dedication, and motivation.40. Fabulous starcast with an amazing storyline. Katrina has done amazing work and her transformation has gone to the next level. What a dedication towards work.41. Creating such a wonderful concept based on facts and then shortlisting proper actors and actresses for it is a tough task done by Rohit shetty. My personal favourite!42. Speechless! I mean so many artists on one stage acting in a film that has a mixture of emotions, dedication, inspiration, and motivation. Altogether a movie to watch! Please watch Sooryavanshi.43.

Please watch this movie guys! It's a request to all of you. You will never get such a storyline with these actors again altogether in the same movie. Give it a watch.50. A movie that shook to the core. Please watch this movie guys. I recommend Rashmi Rocket as it has every emotion that we as an audience need in a film. Rohit, you are a gem!",Sooryavanshi

2542,alixmansuri,Another Massy movie that stereo types a particular religion,1,5 November 2021,"Script is predictable infact a joke which bollywood has used more than 100 times to find the sweet spot to get more occupancy as the audience is dumb and wants masala and obviously touch your indian patriotic sentiments which is far away from reality... I'd rather say a uri or movies like that show patriotism.. this rohit shetty flying car antics and getting a start cast strategy is just appallingSimple story show muslims as bad guys (as usual) and stereotype them like every other bollywood patriotic film. They try to bomb you, you have a hero who saves the day. Fights bad guys, romances woman, cheesy one liner dialogues and most importantly align terrorism with a religion and then eye wash people with some random brotherhood scenes.. it's like first your brand them and then you give the good folks some benefit of doubt..
I mean let the bad guy be a bad guy, but why would you want to show every shot where's he's praying or doing rituals and zoom in to a faith all the time..Anyways there was a reason this film never came on OTT, and had a theatre release..the viewership would never come from the Intellectual viewers but the masses..Rohit shetty : Im a Gen Z and so are my friends non of them went to watch to the film I watched as it was a family plan. But here's the thing, what you're doing today may not work tomorrow or in a few years the new gen understands and had the ability to call a spade a spade..it's high time we stop hindu muslim biases in movies and evolve as a society.. sub consciously these movies are just creating more hate and negativity then doing good.Good luck and change with times or you will turn shelf ware as the new gen takes over.",Sooryavanshi

Thats what Rohit shetty does ! He's always brilliant and consistent with his direction since ""all the best"" to "" Sooryavanshi"".Katrina kaif has just improved slight a bit from Eid release of 2019 Bharat . But she is always there to deliver and entertain whether it is separation with akki paaji or it is "" Tip Tip "" song.The dialogues could have been better i must say , it was somewhat boring to be honest.I gave it 3/5 .!!! Enjoy this diwali in Rohit shetty style.",Sooryavanshi
2587,rosssirider,SOORYAVANSHI,10,6 November 2021,"Veer Sooryavanshi, a honest ATS officer is given this tough task to find out about upcoming threats to the Mumbai City. As expected, we get to see the assemble of three ""S"" cops- Singham, Simbba and Sooryavanshi in an action packed and explosive finale. The screenplay is unexpectedly slow in the first half. Actually, it has nothing to show you. It's just a basic build-up. But then in the second half, it gathers a momentum when Simmba and Singham make dashing entries. Those last 20 minutes deliver a complete mass oriented blockbuster experience with lots of action, comedy (little childish) and heroic stuff. Sooryavanshi fails to create a standalone impact. The best possible reason for that could be the anticipation created about an assemble of three cops. The same thing happened with Simmba too. The same average entertainer of Rohit was boosted by powerful cameo of Singham and then Veer Sooryavanshi's introduction. From the trailer itself you know that there will be two grand entries sooner or later so naturally you start hyping it and forget the main hero. Akshay Kumar as Veer Sooryavanshi isn't a normal police officer, he is ATS officer. There is difference and people need to understand that. You come to know about it while watching the film and then you realise that you can't expect him to be out-an-out massy cop like the one he played in 'Rowdy Rathore'. His funny dialogues and seriously-quirky conversations keeps you engaged or should i say they are surviving factors. Katrina Kaif looks gorgeous in every single scene but for a change, this character provides her couple scenes where she delivers some good dialogues effectively. Unexpectedly, Ranveer Singh as Bhalerao is too childish in this film. I don't know from where Rohit got this idea to present him in so funny manners that you even forget that he playing a police officer. He looks like comedian who is trying to bring those much needed gags in serious situations. That's not what we saw in Simmba. The same mistakes have been repeated with Ajay Devgn's character Singham. Shetty uses his mass values but forgets to keep his class alive. For instance you enjoy watching Singham when he makes a heroic entry but then you suddenly see him doing unnecessary comedy in utterly serious situations. Actually all three cops to be precise. I mean who cracks jokes when you are fighting with terrorists in a locked premises and a bomb on bo.The first half is absolutely stunning. It has the elements of making a well researched, credible and blindingly fast blitzkrieg that makes you sit up. The second half unfortunately has a typical Rohit Shetty film written all over it, and literally tears down, systematically, everything that the story had built up. It turns into an average Bollywood potboiler, with chest beating supercops, overflowing machismo and adrenalin, and mindless, endless action and spraying of bullets from all sorts of machines possible. Starting from NSG helicopters airlifting vehicles laden with RDX, and terrorists laying siege of the ATS headquarters blow the original content into impunity. Add to it some repetitive and jarring comedy about Akshay Kumar's ""disease"" of forgetting names, a lamenting widow's sermonising Katrina Kaif about holding the family together when the former's husband's pyre is burning and a contrived reason behind Katrina taking her young son to ""safety"" from his father make Sooryavanshi's second half rather laughable. Honestly, the serious buildup of Sooryavanshi was decimated the moment Ranveer Singh's Simbba swung into action, and then on, the film almost unstoppably hurtled downhill.",Sooryavanshi

2589,sooryavanshi-02154,Sooryavanshi review,7,5 November 2021,"First of all, you can take Rohit Shetty out of cinema but you cannot take cinema out of Rohit Shetty. It's in his DNA. No doubt his films have a target audience - MASSES. He understands the pulse of masses like no other.Sooryavanshi as the title suggests is about the life of an ATS officer Veer Sooryavanshi(Akshay Kumar) who's come on a mission to eradicate terrorism and their bosses. Nothing comes between him and his duty. The film starts with a sequence of the 1993 bomb blasts which happened in Bombay and thereafter how the further planning is done by the mastermind to execute more attacks in future. The film has nice dialogues which people will enjoy and also the comic elements bring relief into the serious theme of the movie.The villains of the film mainly Abhimanyu Singh is terrific in his role. Kumud Mishra's plot could have been better. Jackie Shroff impresses in his small yet impactful role.Akshay Kumar as usual is as fit and handsome. Can anyone imagine a 50+ year old doing action like that, i mean seriously, especially the helicopter sequence was mindblowing. The other action sequences are also well executed with the climax being the USP of the film with Singham, Simmba and Sooryavanshi taking on the terrorists. The climax reminded me a bit of the film ""Shootout At Lokhandwala"". Katrina Kaif is good and makes her on screen appearance after a long time and fans will really like her in this role.So friends, forget everything and go have a good time at the cinemas which have opened finally. I'm pretty sure in the coming days the film will pick up. Don't worry about the ""boycott gang"" because they are a group of unemployed losers who preach about boycott but will see the film on telegram. I think it's time for the ""boycott gang"" to say goodbye to earth and shift to mars.Overall, Sooryavanshi deserves to be seen with your family. It's pure big screen entertainment which you cannot afford to miss.My rating - 7/10.",Sooryavanshi

The character , plot driven moments as well as the emotional & humorous moments are really nice & nicely balanced . It also makes an attempt at tugging at your anti terrorism & religious sentiments & rightfully succeeds in that department . Entire supporting cast including @GulshanGroverGG & others really make an impact with whatever screen time
them . Nice 1st half even better 2nd half as the ATS are in a race against time to diffuse a bunch bombs . The presence of Singham & Simba in the climax is nicely weaved & is a moneyshot moment that elevates the concluding portions of the movie . Singham's brief standalone moment in the climax is really nice which is a teaser to #Singham3 .

2971,aanzuu,My two cents after watching the diwali movie.,4,6 November 2021,"As a film student from Nepal,
I am very happy to see the progress bollywood has made in the production POV. The film was quite well paced for an intense but a comedy (because its Rohit Shetty) film, the editing and color grading looked amazing, the cinematography was definitely well planned and executed with focus on point. The sound effects, dialogues were very humorous which helped soften the intensity the topic covers in the story. The action scenes were A grade and I enjoyed thoroughly.But I am quite disappointed that the film lacked alot in terms of social impact.-a pro nationalist action film, fails to properly explore and show the story from the antagonist's POV;especially when the topic covered is very real and sensitive to the current climate in the country.-fails to represent the minorities esp the dalits when its the entire system, the religious beliefs that promotes the oppression of dalits to this day.-glorifies the encounter killing culture of cops in India.-the roles of female identifying characters throughout the film were to serve their male counter parts;whether the female was a doctor, a cop or a con. Never saw any of these characters actually do a job of their depicted profession.Mental health issues just thrown in the trash coz toxic and troubled men are hotter than smarter, consious women. Antagonists in Bollywood are hardly ever seen as humans, so neither zero consideration, empathy pardoned nor cared to reflect on the choices they made which contributed to the storyline.fails to acknowledge the simple but major moral of life that one cannot distinguish the other as good or evil via their nationality, religion and vice versa.",Sooryavanshi

A centuries old plot and storyline. Cringeworthy dialogue writing are what are the main villains of this plot.

Same old Pakistan bashing.Katrina Kaif as usual is an accessory heroine and adds absolutely no value. Im addition she destroys a classic song ( where is the originality of sognwriters?). She's a -4 when rated out of 10.The only bright spots in the movie are probably the scenes with Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh. The movie picks up post Ranveer's entry and Ranveer's brilliance carries it throughI wonder if these ""Established Actors"" actually read and study all aspects of the movie before signing them.My rating is only for Ranveer Singh's part and that of Ajay Degvn's.",Sooryavanshi

But actually its release date: November 5, 2021 in HindiStarting off from where Akshay Kumar's character was introduced in Simmba, Sooryavanshi traces the acts and serious antics of DCP Veer Sooryavanshi, the chief of the Anti-Terrorism Squad in India.Ajay is the best actor and most talented guy that Indian Cinema currently has today. He's versatile who can do a wide range of roles e.g. Action, Comedy, Romance, Drama, Thriller, Horror, Villain, Gangster, Mentally Chanellged. There's something about Ajay that makes his on screen persona work and look realiastic which is his commanding voice and intense eyes. Plus, the body lanugage that used to expeess himKatrina Kaif and Akshay Kumar will reunite after 9 years for Sooryavanshi. They have worked together in various films.

The presence of Singham & Simba in the climax is nicely weaved & is a moneyshot moment that elevates the concluding portions of the movie . Singham's brief standalone moment in the climax is really nice which is a teaser to #Singham3 . This is @iamrohitshetty 's best movie yet I wonder how he'll top it off in the next installment of the universe looking forward to it 👍",Sooryavanshi

The interesting thing to note here is that Veer Sooryavanshi is a mixture of both Super Cops - Singham and Simmba. He is as strong as Singham and at the same time he is funny and weird as Simbba. Veer Sooryavanshi, an honest ATS officer, is assigned the challenging task of figuring out the upcoming threats to Mumbai. As expected, we will see a group of three ""S"" cops - Singham, Simba and Suryavanshi in a lively and explosive finale.",Sooryavanshi

3026,ishaih,VERY GOOD MOVIE,10,6 November 2021,"First i watched this movie trailer. It is very addictively.... I like very much actors in this movie. Akshay Kumar , Ranveer Singh , Ajay Devgan, Katrina Kaif and many beautiful actors and actresses acting in this movie.... Akshay Kumar is acted for DCP Veer Sooryavanshi character very good...This movie is suitable for crime catogery very nicely...Veer Sooryavanshi, a honest ATS officer is given this tough task to find out about upcoming threats to the Mumbai City. As expected, we get to see the assemble of three ""S"" cops- Singham, Simbba and Sooryavanshi in an action packed and explosive finale. The screenplay is unexpectedly slow in the first half. Actually, it has nothing to show you. It's just a basic build-up. But then in the second half, it gathers a momentum when Simmba and Singham make dashing entries. Those last 20 minutes deliver a complete mass oriented blockbuster experience with lots of action, comedy (little childish) and heroic stuff. Sooryavanshi fails to create a standalone impact. The best possible reason for that could be the anticipation created about an assemble of three cops. The same thing happened with Simmba too. The same average entertainer of Rohit was boosted by powerful cameo of Singham and then Veer Sooryavanshi's introduction. From the trailer itself you know that there will be two grand entries sooner or later so naturally you start hyping it and forget the main hero.",Sooryavanshi

3032,asskickingmachine,Better than radhe?,4,6 November 2021,We all knew what we are getting into while watching a Rohit Shetty masala movie. Its made and marketed purely for the masses not for us. Akshay Kumar delivered what he was paid for. Action coreography could have been better i really wished if akshay was given the right script (john wick-ish type) he would totally kill it. The cop's wife acting was better than most of the leading actors including expressionless katrina kaif. The script was below average but it made me emotional a few times. And it also sets up future movies and i hope it deliveres. At the end of the day this movie has its moments but failed as a Film.,Sooryavanshi

3043,shankarlalrathore,High quality movie,10,7 November 2021,"Rohit Shetty has brilliantly expanded his cop universe over the years - keeping the audience engaged and die-hard fans of the genre on the edge. After the Singham series (headlined by Ajay Devgn) and then Simbaa (starring Ranveer Singh), now storms in Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar), amidst much fanfare, drama, and blaring theatrics. Sooryavanshi's character was subtly announced towards the end of Simmba. The film has all the elements, attitude, style, showmanship and heavy-duty star power expected of a Rohit Shetty offering.Similar to Simmba, even this cop action saga is narrated by Ajay Devgn, who reminds us of the several terrors attacks which Mumbai has encountered since the 1993 serial blasts to the 2008 terror attack on several landmark locations in Mumbai, including The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). The story in film unfolds as the biggest attack is yet to happen in the city, as some sleeper cells from Lashkar have been activated and it is found that 600 kilos of RDX left over from '93 serial attacks is being used for the purpose.Enter DCP Veer Sooryavanshi, with a solid mission and a lot of garam khoon to protect the city from another big attack. He is so committed towards his duty that even his family, wife Riya (Katrina Kaif) and son Aryan come second to his mighty task at hand.With the cross-border plot, the film revolves around the concept of revenge, 'An Eye For An Eye, Makes The Whole World Blind.' While the story itself plays it safe (basic and predictable), the action is risky and rousing (Rohit Shetty and Suniel Rodrigues). The chase sequence between Veer and John (Sikander Kher) on the streets of Bangkok is a visual delight.Akshay Kumar delivers a powerful, praise-worthy, knockout performance. From his seeti-worthy entry to the relentless gunshots - he justifies his super cop act. Apart from the high adrenalin physical encounters, there are umpteen high drama chases, with cars, bikes and helicopters as Akshay Kumar displays his unquestionable action skills. Overall, it's an Akshay Kumar's show all the way with his star power and screen presence looming large. Katrina Kaif looks stunning on screen and her sensual moves to the iconic song 'Tip Tip Barsa Paani' is undoubtedly clap-worthy, but you can't not think of the original 'Mast Mast' girl of Bollywood, Raveena Tandon.Ajay Devgn's and Ranvir Singh's smashing (quite literally) entry in the second half elevates the film and adds the striking punch. As Bajirao Singham and Sangram Bhalerao respectively, the three actors steal the show in the final 20 minutes of the show where they have performed together.The ensemble cast, which includes Jackie Shroff as the leader of terrorist gang Omar Afeez, as well as other group members Gulshan Grover, Abhimanyu Singh, Kumud Mishra and Nikitin Dheer, makes a substantial contribution to the plot's progression. Jaaved Jaaferi's portrayal of ATS head Kabir Shroff, on the other hand, perfectly plays his serious cop part.While the background score of Sooryavansi sets the mood, the songs are not particularly memorable. The revamped version of 'Najaa' is an earworm, but we don't get to hear it in the film. However, the trio dancing to Daler Mehndi's 'Aila Re Aillaa' is entertaining.Veer Sooryavanshi, Akshay Kumar has successfully taken over the mantle from his predecessors (Singham and Simmba), and with a generous dose of flying and somersaulting cars, this one is quite a bumper Diwali entertainer for you. And if you are a fan of high voltage action movies, go lap this up!9 out of 33 found this helpful.",Sooryavanshi

3075,Parvez5530,An average masala entertainer boosted by Rohit Shetty's unique idea of Cop-Universe,10,7 November 2021,"Sooryavanshi has been awaited since 2018 when Veer Sooryavanshi made a surprise entry in Rohit Shetty's Cop-Universe. In the climax scene of 'Simmba', it was clear that Akshay Kumar's Veer Sooryanashi isn't going to be the same cop we have seen before. He was supposed to be different from 'Singham' and 'Simmba' and after watching Sooryavanshi, it is confirmed. An interesting thing to note here is, Veer Sooryavanshi is a combo of both the Super Cops- Singham and Simmba. He is intense like Singham and at the same time he is funny & quirky like Simbba. Rohit Shetty gambles smartly with the idea of bringing together these three super cops in a mainstream entertainer and he adds couple of strong motives like Hindu-Muslim unity and a mandatory glorification of all the heroes in uniform who serve us day and night. The problem with the film is that it is too typical about its graphics. Not a single scene goes without prediction of audience. It seems like that Rohit Shetty hasn't moved from those stereotype glimpses of 'Chennai Express' (2013) and 'Singham Returns' (2015) as if those were great films. The box office success is a whole different thing when it comes to commercial potboilers but sadly it encourages our filmmakers to continue repeating the same things. It's 2021 but Rohit is still trying to make a film of 2011. 'Singham' still remains his best work post 'Golmaal Fun Unlimited' and now after watching 'Sooryavanshi', i am sure that he will never be able to make a high-repeat value film like that. His Golmaal franchise hasn't really got any good film since 2006, and the same goes with 'Singham' (considering it as a pioneer to this Cop-universe). He failed to leave an impact with every film he made after Singham but the problem is, he never learnt from mistakes. Rather, he continued using the same jokes and cliches in all his films because his films were smash hits at box office. Maybe the audience wants to see the same stuff again so i don't blame him much but i must say that he is losing his touch.Veer Sooryavanshi, a honest ATS officer is given this tough task to find out about upcoming threats to the Mumbai City. As expected, we get to see the assemble of three ""S"" cops- Singham, Simbba and Sooryavanshi in an action packed and explosive finale. The screenplay is unexpectedly slow in the first half. Actually, it has nothing to show you. It's just a basic build-up. But then in the second half, it gathers a momentum when Simmba and Singham make dashing entries. Those last 20 minutes deliver a complete mass oriented blockbuster experience with lots of action, comedy (little childish) and heroic stuff. Sooryavanshi fails to create a standalone impact. The best possible reason for that could be the anticipation created about an assemble of three cops. The same thing happened with Simmba too. The same average entertainer of Rohit was boosted by powerful cameo of Singham and then Veer Sooryavanshi's introduction. From the trailer itself you know that there will be two grand entries sooner or later so naturally you start hyping it and forget the main hero. Akshay Kumar as Veer Sooryavanshi isn't a normal police officer, he is ATS officer. There is difference and people need to understand that. You come to know about it while watching the film and then you realise that you can't expect him to be out-an-out massy cop like the one he played in 'Rowdy Rathore'. His funny dialogues and seriously-quirky conversations keeps you engaged or should i say they are surviving factors. Katrina Kaif looks gorgeous in every single scene but for a change, this character provides her couple scenes where she delivers some good dialogues effectively. Unexpectedly, Ranveer Singh as Bhalerao is too childish in this film. I don't know from where Rohit got this idea to present him in so funny manners that you even forget that he playing a police officer. He looks like comedian who is trying to bring those much needed gags in serious situations. That's not what we saw in Simmba. The same mistakes have been repeated with Ajay Devgn's character Singham. Shetty uses his mass values but forgets to keep his class alive. For instance you enjoy watching Singham when he makes a heroic entry but then you suddenly see him doing unnecessary comedy in utterly serious situations. Actually all three cops to be precise. I mean who cracks jokes when you are fighting with terrorists in a locked premises and a bomb on body?Sooryavanshi has a big cast to fill the negative bag but none of them makes any difference. Jackie Shroff, Gulshan Grover, Abhimanyu Singh, Sikander Kher, Nikiteen Dheer all are decent in their roles but nobody really looks like playing a dangerous villian. Of course i don't expect every Rohit Shetty film to have a terrific villain like Jaykant Shikare played by Prakash Raj but please give us something convincing at least. The music adds more glamour and entertainment in the film but slows down the pace. 'Aila Re Aila"" comes with end credits, 'Mere Yaara' is strictly average and 'Tip Tip Barsa Paani' is there right after Interval point to surprise you. It does not match the original of course, but it's Hot! Rohit Shetty repeats those old cliches to satisfy his hardcore fans and maybe that's what they want. The struggle of cinematographer can be seen in those unstable frames. Thankfully, the background score is stimulating. Simmba had better though, which, you can experience here again on Ranveer's entry scene. Singham's BGM is out of reach by far.Coming to the plus points, Rohit Shetty challenges himself to deliver some socially important stuff here. Like in Simbba, he tried to convey the seriousness of 'Rape Cases In The Country', here he brings patriotism and nationalism. He makes sure that every single thing is enjoyed by masses and family audiences. I am not sure if quality cinema lovers will like it. All said enough, i must say that Sooryavanshi is a relief for cinema industry as it brings back that much needed commercial cinema. We have been missing a big event film like this for almost 20 months, and here it is. Sooryavanshi deserves to be watched once with normal expectations. But the hype and excitement of assembled version of cops is left behind. In normal time (in 2020 i mean), it would have been a Super Hit at box office for sure. Predicting the box office fate today is difficult, especially for a film which is entitled to set the new parameters. With Sooryavanshi, we will know the new dimensions of box office so let's support it for that. Overall, an average film uplifted by first-ever grand assemble of three massy friendly characters in modern bollywood.",Sooryavanshi

They have amazing Hollywood movies.Sarfarosh is one of the best cop movie ever made n it is very realistic, gripping n gritty.The cops in Sarfarosh/Bullit/The French Connection doesn't hang around in helicopters n defy physics.Coming back to this movie, there is nothing redeemable in this movie.Basically its a poor man's Michael Bay movies rip off.Ranveer Singh's character gets on ur nerves with his accent n body movements.So much overacting man.Akshay's character is totally unbelievable n anti physics.His walks, his mannerisms n body language doesn't look like that of a cop.I dont know how Devgn got trapped into this abysmal movie.Some of the 80s Hollywood action movies are much better than this lousy movie.If u are in the mood for realistic n good cop movies then better watch Sarfarosh, Bullit, The French Connection, End of Watch, Training Day, Serpico and the amazing Infernal Affairs. Avoid The Departed which is the remake of Infernal Affairs.",Sooryavanshi

3173,rm-00188,Fantastic movie,10,8 November 2021,"The first major Bollywood theatrical release since March 2020 (Baaghi 3 was the major release just before Corona struck us); Sooryavanshi can be called an ideal festive dhamaka to pull back the audience to cinema halls which have sadly, been shut or running empty since then...Rohit Shetty's cop universe extends to Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar), an ATS officer, who along with Singham (Devgn) and Simmba (Ranveer) take on the terror group (Jackie Shroff and company) planning to blow up Mumbai once again. À la March 1993.Akshay is in top form again after Bell Bottom (2021) and the Bangkok action stunts are a treat to watch reminding us of his daredevilry in Sabse Bada Khiladi (1995). Katrina Kaif, playing his wifey, sizzles the screen in the remixed 'Tip tip barsa paani' number from Mohra (1994) though I preferred Raveena's sensuous jhatkas from the original. Yea, the plot is typical '90s stuff but cleverly updated to present times.Infact, the first half is a breeze watch with all the action, emotions and drama unfolding at a super fast pace. Rohit even brings a secular touch in a particular scene where Muslims help Hindus to take Ganpati idol from Mandir to a safe place in course of a terror strike even as a remixed ""Chodo kal ki baatein...Hum Hindustani"" song plays in the background. Pop bhaichara, indeed!!Post interval, the film dithers and withers a bit as the screenplay appears to be in a tearing hurry to introduce its two main cameo characters - you know who!!Ranveer Singh and Ajay Devgn make their grand entry and then, Shetty completely lets the action department take charge. Which ain't a bad decision at all as the stunts are imaginatively executed. Notably, the continous shot of Ranveer bashing up a dirty dozen is superb. Taalimaar!!The dialogues are massy, the technical aspects are okey dokey and the end finale promises to carry forward the franchise with a Singham sequel. Clearly, the focus is to entertain. Nothing more. Nothing less. And that is important...in the current times when audience hasn't been to theatres since early 2020. In that sense, Sooryavanshi truly achieves its objective. And thats why it should be seen. Only in theatres please!!",Sooryavanshi

I am waiting for soo long time to happen this combination.this is the one of the most perfect movie in 2021.i huge recommended fo this movie.",Sooryavanshi
3181,alyanu-39766,movie frm bollywood,10,8 November 2021,"Sooryavanshi starts off with the right intent, pace, narrative and sentiment. The backdrop is the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai, and the masterminds giving the cops a slip, but leaving a live imprint behind - if 400 kg RDX were used for the blasts, where are the remaining 600 kg? Fast forward to 2007, 40 Lashkar operatives from Pakistan sneak into India and commerce sleeper cells all around the country, awaiting instructions from the chief Omar Hafeez (Jackie Shroff) to start another siege. Advance to the current day, Bilal (Kumud Mishra) the key mastermind of the 1993 blast returns to India via Maldives, releasing the cache of the 600 kg RDX from an inconspicuous house in Sawantwadi, and activates the sleeper cells, under the leadership of Riyaz Hafeez, Omar's son, swearing to burn the nation down. Riyaz has another axe to grind with the Mumbai Police, to avenge the death of his elder brother.DSP Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar) is the supercop with the ATS leading the Intelligence Bureau inputs. An experienced, successful and time tested policeman, Veer meticulously follows through in his swashbuckling style to thwart the destructive attempt. He isn't alone in the fightback, and is ably supported by the NSG, Singham (Ajay Devgn) and Simbba (Ranveer Singh) in this all out action adventure.The first half is absolutely stunning. It has the elements of making a well researched, credible and blindingly fast blitzkrieg that makes you sit up. The second half unfortunately has a typical Rohit Shetty film written all over it, and literally tears down, systematically, everything that the story had built up. It turns into an average Bollywood potboiler, with chest beating supercops, overflowing machismo and adrenalin, and mindless, endless action and spraying of bullets from all sorts of machines possible. Starting from NSG helicopters airlifting vehicles laden with RDX, and terrorists laying siege of the ATS headquarters blow the original content into impunity. Add to it some repetitive and jarring comedy about Akshay Kumar's ""disease"" of forgetting names, a lamenting widow's sermonising Katrina Kaif about holding the family together when the former's husband's pyre is burning and a contrived reason behind Katrina taking her young son to ""safety"" from his father make Sooryavanshi's second half rather laughable. Honestly, the serious buildup of Sooryavanshi was decimated the moment Ranveer Singh's Simbba swung into action, and then on, the film almost unstoppably hurtled downhill.",Sooryavanshi

3442,donp-21055,💥💥💥,9,9 November 2021,"Finally something for the theatre owners to cheer about. Also for us, the audience!!The first major Bollywood theatrical release since March 2020 (Baaghi 3 was the major release just before Corona struck us); Sooryavanshi can be called an ideal festive dhamaka to pull back the audience to cinema halls which have sadly, been shut or running empty since then...Rohit Shetty's cop universe extends to Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar), an ATS officer, who along with Singham (Devgn) and Simmba (Ranveer) take on the terror group (Jackie Shroff and company) planning to blow up Mumbai once again. À la March 1993.Akshay is in top form again after Bell Bottom (2021) and the Bangkok action stunts are a treat to watch reminding us of his daredevilry in Sabse Bada Khiladi (1995). Katrina Kaif, playing his wifey, sizzles the screen in the remixed 'Tip tip barsa paani' number from Mohra (1994) though I preferred Raveena's sensuous jhatkas from the original. Yea, the plot is typical '90s stuff but cleverly updated to present times.Infact, the first half is a breeze watch with all the action, emotions and drama unfolding at a super fast pace. Rohit even brings a secular touch in a particular scene where Muslims help Hindus to take Ganpati idol from Mandir to a safe place in course of a terror strike even as a remixed ""Chodo kal ki baatein...Hum Hindustani"" song plays in the background. Pop bhaichara, indeed!!Post interval, the film dithers and withers a bit as the screenplay appears to be in a tearing hurry to introduce its two main cameo characters - you know who!!Ranveer Singh and Ajay Devgn make their grand entry and then, Shetty completely lets the action department take charge. Which ain't a bad decision at all as the stunts are imaginatively executed. Notably, the continous shot of Ranveer bashing up a dirty dozen is superb. Taalimaar!!The dialogues are massy, the technical aspects are okey dokey and the end finale promises to carry forward the franchise with a Singham sequel. Clearly, the focus is to entertain. Nothing more. Nothing less. And that is important...in the current times when audience hasn't been to theatres since early 2020. In that sense, Sooryavanshi truly achieves its objective. And thats why it should be seen. Only in theatres.",Sooryavanshi
3443,bollywood-10313,Blockbuster hit....,10,9 November 2021,It is the best masala movie in the history of bollywood megastar akshay kumar did underful work.Katrina also perfect in tip tip and ranvir and ajay also performed decently.,Sooryavanshi
3444,sachdevapoonish,Why?,3,9 November 2021,Why the hell does bollywood keep making the same type of action films that have been negatively reviewed multiple times in the past.

There was proper chracter development, good story build up even if with some mediocre acting. The action scenes are great too (only in the first half).I walked into the theater with very low expectations and by the intermission, I had pretty high expectations. Alas, that's probably my mistake. The 2nd half is a big let down.For the sake of it, they had to add an item song. The action scenes are over exaggerated and the story goes down the drain too. Most of the 2nd half is used to sensationalize the protagonists.The one thing the movie does absolutely right is in choosing the actors for negative roles. There are more than one negative characters in the movie and all of them are brilliant.",Sooryavanshi

Movies like these are usually B-grade films in large movie markets like China, Europe and USA. In India, they are big budget blockbusters. Says a lot about the country and the audience.The 1993 bombings are one of the most brutal and violent attacks on our country and our people.

Jab tak Hindustan me cinema hai .. bas samaj jao.The story line is soo predictable with a misplaced use of humour as well. I expected much better from Akshay Kumar.lots of fluff and very little content. Its time Akshay kumar realised that churning out the same rubbish again and again won't cut ice with the audience .This may or may not become a hit but trust me there is nothing new or exciting some scenes are soo amateurish and mediocre .I would skip but if you like Akshay kumar you would want to watch but will be disappointed.Story and script is more important than star power. Why did Andha Dhun become a hit? Story and brilliant acting and not star power.Ranvir is totally out of place joker I don't know what the hell he is doing here and what he was paid for.

You wont be able to blink the eyes. There are few emotional scenes as well.Here I want to especially mentioned that normally in hindi movie director represent terrorist in a evil way but here they show some of their backdrop as well (which can we appreciate by many).Acting wise all done well.But, it seems that this is a last run for Akshay Kumar as he looks aged in this movie.

I was yawning on the first half and until the final 30 minutes. Sooryavanshi movie is complete boring & trash doing a good job putting me to sleep in theatre. Don't waste your money for some 2 hours of BS. However, I should praise that Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Kapoor saved the movie from becoming a flop. They are the sole reason why this movie is sold because of the popularity from past movies. Besides that, the first part and segment after the interval are full of trash. Don't watch it.

I went in with high hopes of Akshay Kumar stealing the show, making the movie his and then we have a collaboration.What everyone seemingly forgot about this multi verse idea is Sooryavanshi has just been introduced, he's had no single film of his own therefore has no identity, Singham we all know and Simmba as annoying as it was.Katrina's story brought little value to the film. It was a way of getting two songs into the film and a slight emotional angle.For me personally it should have only been a singular hero story. Then bring in all three under a different banner that brands them as a team of police doing the right thing.Could have been better for all the hype enjoyed Ranveer Singh he surprised me.Ajay Devgn well he's the bench mark.Overall a big disappointment for me.",Sooryavanshi

Poor storyline, some backdated concept of Muslims are plotting terrorist attack in India. And overall, very boring. Acton is worsts at it's best.
