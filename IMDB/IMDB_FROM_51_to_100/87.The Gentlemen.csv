0,MartinHafer,That's Hugh Grant?! It seems so unlike him in his other films!,9,13 September 2020,"Aside from a few very marketable films like ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" and ""Aladdin"", Guy Ritchie is a writer/director who makes incredibly violent films. That is, incredibly violent films which are also brilliantly constructed and near perfect. While I rarely ever watch violent films, I eagerly look for his next dark British crime film, after seeing his ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch""....and so it's not surprising I'd see ""The Gentlemen"". And, like these other films, it's near perfect...and a film you ought to see if you have the stomach for this sort of story.So this leads me to a huge warning. This is NOT a family-friendly film nor one you want to show your mother or Father Jenkins if he stops by for a visit. There's ample cursing, loads of violence, vomit galore, and the story is about bad people...very bad people.The story is complicated...and goes together like a finely crafted puzzle. It concerns a marijuana czar in Britain, Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) and his desire to sell out and retire to a life of ease and sophistication. However, after making an offer to a rival drug kingpin, suddenly everything goes haywire....folks start dying, farms growing the stuff are hit and an all-out war seems inevitable. There's WAY more to the story than this...but since it's so complex, it's best you just see it to appreciate it.The bottom line is that Guy Ritchie can write and direct amazing films...and this one is truly amazing and entertaining. Apart from his misguided vanity project, ""Swept Away"", his output has been impressive and I cannot stress enough what a quality product this film is. My only MINOR quibble is what about the Russian mobster.....what happens with him? This isn't really dealt with in the film and seems a bit like a dangling plot point.",The Gentlemen
1,Leofwine_draca,Another abomination,3,14 November 2020,"Having witnessed the cinematic abominations put out by Guy Ritchie since his last decent movie - 2000's SNATCH - I wasn't expecting much from THE GENTLEMEN and I didn't get it, either. It's a throwback to his gangster flicks of yesteryear, but cruder, dumber and more generic than ever. The plot is updated to modern times with smart phones, street gangs and rap, but it's just mindlessly convoluted, deeply unfunny, profane, and seems to go on and on with no end in sight. Hugh Grant's narrator is more caricature than character, and the only decent performances come from Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrell; literally the only decent things in this.",The Gentlemen
2,SnoopyStyle,chock full of the Ritchie style,6,11 April 2020,"Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is a sleazy private investigator trying to sell info and a script to Raymond Smith (Charlie Hunnam), the right hand man of weed kingpin Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey). Mickey is married to Rosalind (Michelle Dockery) and has a network of grow ops operating out of a dozen estates of British nobility. He's trying to sell his business to Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong). Dry Eye (Henry Golding) is a ruthless ambitious drug dealer. Coach (Colin Farrell) is a youth boxing coach.This Guy Ritchie film is chock full of the Ritchie style. Every character has the brash Ritchie gangster style. Something is missing which made it a start and stop watch for me. I come to realize that I don't care about any of the characters. It starts with the structure which is unreliable narrator Fletcher telling the story to Raymond (who should already know most of it anyways). Hunnam is playing an unemotional henchman. Otherwise, he should be the perfect rooting interest. There is no reason for Fletcher to recount the whole story other than a movie reason. Raymond already knows most of the story making the film a waiting game for his character. It saps the tension out of the twists and turns. I do wonder if it would be more compelling to play it straight. This is very much a straight up Ritchie film and his fans will root for it. I had a tougher time.",The Gentlemen
3,boblipton,Ritchie Back In Form,8,26 January 2020,"Matthew McConaughey, who has become one of the major players in the British weed trade through science, paying poor noblemen to let him stash his farms on their property, and a judicious amount of leg-breaking, thinks it's time to retire. He offers to sell his business to a fellow entrepreneur for £400,000,000, but other people in the illegal fun trade have their own agendas.Guy Ritchie has returned to his early themes of violence, chaos, and rock&roll from his early career, and has scored a definite hit, with some fine performances, including a blank-faced one by Charlie Hunnam and an outsized comedy turn by Colin Farrell. Hugh Grant does well as the unwanted on-screen narrator of events, putting them into some order; I am impressed by his lack of a posh accent, event as I wished Ritchie had been able to think of a better way of telling the audience the story.Even with that cavil, the unceasing action and insanity kept me more than interested throughout.",The Gentlemen
4,Horst_In_Translation,The usual Ritchie in terms of both strong and weak aspects,6,10 March 2020,"""The Gentlemen"" is the newest movie by director Guy Ritchie, who is also one of the three writers here and is nowadays still not only known for his movies, but also for the fact that he was once married to Madonna. This film runs for approximately 110 minutes and looking at it in detail, I would say that his approach and the outcome in terms of style and pretty much everything else is the same like it was 20 years ago for him. It's very frequently style over substance. The fact how over the top the story may be is not too important if there are constantly cool quotes, spectacular characters and outrageous events happening. The best example is the kid falling out of the window. Or that there are rails where the Asian guy falls down and that this very second also a train arrives. Or his name of course and the many jokes about this are also a prime example. But it also results in a lot of fun. I just mentioned Aslan falling out of the window already. Now that entire scene was hilarious with Hunnam's character and the kids there and the two strong folks too of course. And also after he falls out of the window when we see Hunnam run after the boys (or one of them), then have a conflict with them, then pull his gun. And so on. Also how one of the two brutes deals with the situation and we see it just like Hunnam's character does. All accompanied by some of the smartest and most hilarious dialogues out there.I think Hunnam was my favorite from the cast here. And that means something because it is a really good cast. He is growing more and more on me. I still wonder if his character is actually a cannibal, if he is eating what he seems to be eating near the end? And if yes, then if he knew what he was eating? Namely a juicy piece of prey meat handed to him from the boss lion to his most precious aide? Anyway, my praise for Hunnam means even more because folks like Grant, Marsan and McConaughey are actors I also like a lot. Not to mention that Farrell, Dockery and a few other experienced and highly successful actors are on board here. I somehow feel that with this cast at his disposal, Ritchie could have come up with something better. But it is really all almost pointless fun from beginning to end. Of course there are also sexual references, but the most ""worrying"" is the great deal of violence here. Also not just that it happens, but how it happens. It is sometimes pretty extreme. Take the meat references towards the end. Or how it starts right away as we see McConaughey's character at a restaurant just having a tea or coffee or so and then somebody comes and shoots him in the head. Well, at least it seemed that way. Reality is different as we find out later on. But it could have happened like this because all we see afterwards for over 60 minutes after this little opening takes place before said opening. Other than that, it's a fairly chronological movie.McConaughey seems like the protagonist early on, the lion as he calls himself, but the longer the film goes, the more it turns into an ensemble performance really and there are long sequences that do not feature him at all, even if at the very end, he is back again as strong as possible and he almost looks like a lion there, too strong maybe even because at some point, it just felt like a film that tried his best to show us the most hopeless situations for McConaughey's character and how he always manages to get out of them. Often through mere luck. It is just really absurd. Hunnam's character arriving on time at the restaurant was still alright, but how the boxer kids open fire and kill the two Russian gangsters in the front seats was just too ridiculous honestly. Or also how Farrell's character kills those at Hunnam's character's house. I must say I struggled a bit with Farrell's role in general, already his very first scene when he shows these boys how he is physically and intellectually superior there. Prime example of the aforementioned style over substance. Oh well. Then again I am not a big fan anymore as I was years ago when it comes to Farrell.The one actor I like more is Hugh Grant (he has steadily risen in my perception and was Oscar-worthy in ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" not too long ago), so I was a bit disappointed that he is basically only used for the framework here and a bit of a blackmail story because honestly I could have done without this part completely. He is not needed to tell the story, even if he has his fun moments too like how he comes from the bathroom when the two gangsters arrive with Aslan's corpse. But as a whole, he could have added a lot more if his character had been written more convincingly. At the end, how he ends up in that box and still has this revelation to share about Aslan's dad and the consequences coming with it and how it all happens at the same time is also really exaggerared. I did not like it too much. At the end, he seems free, but nope not yet, he is again in Hunnam's character' car. When Grant's character gives the script to Miramax (also the actual producer here of course), he implies there could be a sequel to his ideas, which certainly can be understood in a way that this film here could also get a sequel. Also fairly fun how people in his story at the end end up in cars under dangerous circumstances while also he ends up in a car in a situation he desperately wants to get out of. Will he live or die? We also will see in a sequel perhaps. I think this one here was good enough for me to check out a sequel if they ever make one. I hope they use another awesome song for the opening credits there just like they did here (""Cumberland Gap""). Had to download immediately when I was home. I hope such a sequel features Hunnam's character prominently then, maybe even more at the center of the story than he was here.Okay, what else can I say about this film. I was really tired at the beginning, so maybe this is why I felt that it needed a while to become a good film. Or I don't know, maybe it never turned into a good film, but just a funny, fairly creative one. The core story is really easy to criticize with how absurd it turns out at times (also the complete absence of police) and I am not one bit surprised that critics apparently did not like the film too much from what I have read. I probably could write another two paragraphs, most likely more, only filled with cool quotes here, but I won't. Instead I say: Go watch the film yourself and I am positive you will smile or even laugh a lot. Also about the absurd comedy. Even when there is talk about a guy being locked in a gigantic freezer, it is somewhat funny. Enough said. Tarantino will perhaps like it too. Let's just hope the guy in the freezer will not have a similar fate like Aslan('s corpse). Oh well, then again I did not like him too much either, the guy in the freezer I mean, the Jew with his crabs that is, perhaps also because of his introduction early on. Later on, he was slightly more interesting, but there it was also basically McConaughey just doing all the work in the scene with him. Oh and Eddie Marsan yes, I have to mention him because I really adore the actor. Now his scene with the pigs and the implications what happened (luckily they spare us the visual side) were just so wrong and yet hilarious. Nice to see Marsan getting to work with some really big stars here. In that scene, or the aftermath, even Farrell's comments were truly hilarious about how they could never unsee what happened there. They should have named the pig Napoléon though, no idea how they forgot about this reference.Okay, this is all then I suppose. I give the movie a thumbs-up for sure and recommend checking it out. Could have been 10-15 minutes shorter though if they had left out some of the weaker parts or the entire frame story (and given Grant a better role). Even there, when they try to be smart, like with the wire in the shoes, it is never ""Knives Out"" level. Still, it's worth 110 minutes of your time, especially if you like most of the actors as much as I do. What I do have to say though is that in terms of character writing, Ritchie still has to win me over that he can also come up with high-quality female characters. Sure, it is difficult in a world of organized crime, but Dockery definitely is not it here. The young girl at the apartment that they are supposed to bring home is even more interesting although she has like 10% of Dockery's screen time. At least in terms of items Dockery delivers. That tiny golden gun is really cool and also the references to it being just a paperweight. Okay, now that is really all. I think you could say that ""cool"" is the perfect word to describe the movie, even if it certainly is also a bit on the shallow side.",The Gentlemen

Perhaps not the best gangster business to be in, but they make it look good. Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is a private investigator who claims to have the goods on Mickey. He is discussing the details of the shakedown with Ray (Charlie Hunnam), Mickey's right-hand man. The film story is told as flashbacks. In the opening cliche teaser scene it appears Mickey is shot, but we know that can't be so because this feature follows too many film formulas, so we see the ""twists"" coming including who set up the raid on Mickey.It wasn't a bad film except I didn't like how it jumped. It introduced too many players. The whole pot idea didn't fly, but as a tough guy film, it was all right.Guide; F-word. brief rape. No nudity.",The Gentlemen
7,kosmasp,Guy Ritchie,9,4 April 2020,"Yes, I am tempted to say he's back. It's not that he went away or didn't have at least some decent movies over the last few years. I haven't seen Aladdin, but it was succesful sort of. But this is right up his alley! This is pure and enjoyable Guy Ritchie, with timeline cuts and jumps and characters that one may think only he can write.It's so great to see Matthew McConaughey joining the ranks, being a substitue for Jason Statham I reckon. But also having Hugh Grant in this ... role/character. Genius! Who'd have thunk it, and he kills it (no pun intended). At least a few twists will be easy to spot, but I don't think one can guess everything. Even so, the movie is so well made, it won't really matter. If you like the genre, this is the one to watch. Fun and thrilling to the end ...",The Gentlemen
8,classicsoncall,"""I'm basing my crescendo on the sum of it's parts.""",9,1 September 2020,"Any Guy Ritchie film I've seen, he always delivers, especially when he's writer and director. This one follows in the tradition of ""Rocknrolla"", ""Snatch"", and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", the story layered with multiple sets of gangsters trying to outdo each other for the grand prize at the end of the flick. I got a kick out of the opening scene in which the bartender pouring Michael Pearson's (Matthew McConaughey) pint pulls down on the bar tap handle reading 'Ritchie Sewing Company', a self promoting piece of business I found pretty clever.This one doesn't seem to be as hard to follow as the earlier mentioned films. All of them prompted a second viewing to catch all the nuance of the characters, but this one, even with the chronology going back and forth, was pretty straightforward. That's probably due to the format, essentially a narration of events by journalist Fletcher (Hugh Grant) relating his investigative work to Pearson's right hand man, bodyguard and driver Raymond (Charlie Hunnam). Colin Farrell's character is simply known as 'Coach', and he's drawn into the story by virtue of his gangsta underlings botching a take down of one of Pearson's weed farms. What could have been an ancillary character winds up being central to the outcome of the story.And just about when you think it's over, another twist occurs with the introduction of a Russian oligarch and his mission of revenge for the death of his son. All the while you have to wonder how the picture's principal character, that would be Pearson, manages to come out of the story intact, considering all the bad guys who want to do him in. It's a fun watch if you go for this kind of stuff, made all the merrier by the script's creative use of the English language. You know, maybe I will watch this all over again.",The Gentlemen
9,jboothmillard,The Gentlemen,4,11 January 2020,"When it comes to films directed by Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch), they can be hit and misses, with big misses including Swept Away, Revolver, Sherlock Holmes, and King Arthur, but the trailer for this film looked worth a try, even just for the star of Four Wedding and Love Actually playing completely against his usual type. Basically, American businessman Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) has formed a highly profitable marijuana empire in London and across England. The drugs kingpin is looking to cash out his business, and when the words gets out, several schemes, bribes and blackmails are triggered in an attempt to steal his domain. It is reported that Pearson has been shot dead, and private eye and aspiring screenwriter Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is employed by a newspaper to investigate. He visits Pearson's right-hand man Ray (Nicholas Nickleby's Charlie Hunnam) and threatens to expose the empire, he tells a full-length detailed backstory of the origins of the business, up until the present. This includes the many hidden marijuana plantations across the countryside, and Pearson's wife Rosalind (Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery) being part of key decisions. Fletcher also details the many characters behind the scenes, including Coach (Colin Farrell), or trying to take it away, including Dry Eye (Henry Golding). The British crime underworld is close to exposure, but all is not as it seems, and Pearson may not actually be dead. Also starring Jeremy Strong as Cannabis King Matthew, Eddie Marsan as Mike, Jason Wong and Phuc and Jordan Long as Barman. McConaughey gives a good performance as the yank head honcho, there is good support from Hunnam, Dockery and Golding, but this film is pretty much taken by Grant, who with his cockney accent, goatee beard and sunglasses outshines all. It is nice of Ritchie to return his geezers gangsters and guns origins, but let's be honest, it is a bit of a rehash of what we've seen before, the dialogue is witty, there are amusing moments, and the editing is clever, but overall it just feels meh, an average action crime drama. Okay!",The Gentlemen
10,BA_Harrison,Must hold the record for the most frequent use of the 'C' word.,8,12 January 2020,"Having spent a decade or so making Hollywood blockbusters (with varying degrees of success), director Guy Ritchie returns to the genre that first made him famous: Tarantino à la UK. Some might see this as a backwards step, but in my opinion, it's what he does best.This time around, the ace in Ritchie's hand is Hugh Grant, who brilliantly plays pivotal character Fletcher, a tabloid reporter who tries to blackmail powerful drug lord Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), threatening to publish an extremely damaging story if he doesn't receive a payment of £20m within 72 hours. The film unfolds as Fletcher tells Pearson's right hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) the story of how he gathered the dirt on his boss. Grant's performance is pure genius: playing against type he is seriously sleazy and frequently hilarious.Not that the rest of the cast are any slouches: Hunnam is cool and badass, Colin Farrell displays a keen comedic touch as tough gym owner Coach, McConaughey is his usual affable self (but with a seriously dangerous edge), Michelle Dockery impresses as Pearson's spunky wife Rosalind, and Jeremy Strong holds his own as the criminal who wants to buy Pearson's marijuana operation. Even the minor characters are great as well, from the Coach's grime-loving lads 'TheToddlers' to the obnoxious housing estate yoofs who give Ray's 'muscle' the runaround.Ritchie's writing and direction is possibly his best yet, the script sparkling with wit and the visuals both stylish and confident. The dialogue is extremely funny (and loaded with expletives), the violence gloriously OTT, and the characters memorable. It might be a case of Ritchie 'playing it safe' by revisiting familiar territory, but when the result is as entertaining as this, why the hell not?",The Gentlemen

13,CinemaSerf,"A fun, complex but wordy crime drama....",7,1 January 2020,"This is quite a cleverly interwoven crime story. Hugh Grant is surprisingly good in the role of a sort of camp narrator, as he tries his hand at blackmail by regaling an unflappable Charlie Hunnam with his interpretation of the goings-on around the attempted sale of an empire of ill-gotten gains by a really under-rated Matthew McConaughey, to an even more sexually ambiguous American billionaire. It's funny, mischievous and slick. Colin Farrell doesn't feature extensively, but when he does, he is cool and entertaining. There is a surfeit of Anglo-Saxon which I felt was a touch necessary - after a while it stops being a laugh and starts irritating. At times the script is witty and well paced, but for most of the film there is too little action and much too much verbiage. A good watch, though.",The Gentlemen

He finds a buyer but then things start to get complicated. Another potential buyer appears and when Pearson rejects his offer, things start to go wrong in his operation.Superb. Written and directed by Guy Ritchie this has all his trademarks: gangsters as the good guys (and bad guys), clever, gritty plot with some great twists, great tongue-in cheek humour. It is a tour de force by Ritchie and, as much as I love Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch and RocknRolla, is his best work.Not only does the film play to Ritchie's strengths it also feels less formulaic than his usual gangster-crime offerings. While he is good at what he does, his plots do feel a bit repetitive at times. This, while still falling in his usual arc, has an originality about it which is quite refreshing.All this is helped by a star-studded cast - Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell, Eddie Marsan - none of whom put a foot wrong. Hugh Grant is almost unrecognisable as the slimy journalist: a great departure from the shy, nerdy roles he is known for.Highly recommended.",The Gentlemen
15,ferguson-6,back to the Ritchie roots,7,23 January 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. Let's get this out of the way upfront. Filmmaker Guy Ritchie's return to London crime-comedy is most assuredly a bit too far removed from today's acceptable Politically Correct line. It features mostly male characters and far too many stereotypes to count. It's also ridiculously funny. Mr. Ritchie doesn't take his story or characters too seriously, but he proves yet again that he's serious about entertainment.The film begins with Matthew McConaughey ordering ""a pint and a pickled egg"", a jolt to the senses, and a very cool opening credits sequence (think James Bond). We then find Fletcher, a sleazy private detective, making a surprise appearance at Ray's (Charlie Hunnam) house. Fletcher is played by a deliciously smarmy Hugh Grant. He is trying to extort 20 million from Ray by offering up the details he has uncovered about Ray and his boss, marijuana kingpin Mickey Pearson (McConaughey). Conveniently, Fletcher has turned the story into a screenplay, which he has generously agreed to include for the 20 million.It's tricky business trying to make drug dealers likable, and Ritchie steers clear of this despite the presence of a few. In addition to Mickey, we have Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) who is trying to buy Mickey's business; Lord George (Tom Wu), who controls the Chinese syndicate; and Dry Eye (Henry Goulding), an ambitious underling of Lord George who is anxious to make his own way, by any means necessary. Other players here include Mickey's wife Rosalind (Michele Dockery, ""Downton Abbey"", ""Godless"") who runs a ""safe space"" garage for exotic cars owned by women; Coach (Colin Farrell) who runs a boxing gym for troubled young adults; and Big Dave (Eddie Marsan), a tabloid editor seeking revenge for a dinner party where he felt Mickey disrespected him.As if all of those characters don't provide enough humorous crime fodder, we also have a Russian Oligarch, street gangs, heritage estate owners in need of cash, YouTube fight porn, and the plight of Laura Pressfield (Eliot Sumner, Sting's daughter) in a heroin haven. Fletcher's ongoing narrative for Ray provides the framework for the film, and each scene is filled to the rim with clever and wise-cracking dialogue - often delivered with flair by one of our colorful characters. Mr. Grant and Mr. Farrell are exceptionally fun to watch, and Ms. Dockery leaves us wishing her Rosalind was more prominently featured.For some reason he's never been a critical favorite, though Guy Ritchie garnered a cult following with his early frenetic crime flicks LOCK, STOCK and TWO SMOKING BARRELS (1998) and SNATCH (2000). Lately he's been focusing on big budget films like SHERLOCK HOLMES (2009), SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS (2011), THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. (2015) and ALADDIN (2019). He's back to his roots here, and is joined by many actors and crew members he's worked with before. Ritchie co-wrote the screenplay with Ivan Atkinson and Marne Davies. His cinematographer is Alan Stewart (ALADDIN) and his film editor in charge of those signature smash-cuts is frequent collaborator James Herbert.Quick listening pays off in some deadpan one-liners that might otherwise sneak by, although most of them can't be repeated here. The ""c-word"" most frequently used in the film is not 'cash', and is rarely a term of affection. There is even a Miramax gag. Too soon? Only you can decide. It's rare for McConaughey to play the heavy, and he seems to relish the opportunity. But then most of the actors seem to really enjoy delivering these lines and wearing these clothes ... well except for Colin Farrell's track suits and spectacles! Certainly this one isn't for the masses, and undoubtedly people will be offended. This is what happens when you make Guy Ritchie play nicely for a decade.",The Gentlemen
16,gradyharp,"'There's only one rule in the jungle: when the lion's hungry, he eats!'",9,19 April 2020,"Guy Ritchie both wrote the story (with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies) and the screenplay and directed this peppery caper and the result - another unique Guy Ritchie film that continues his style of entertainment.The very brief plot summary only hints at the momentum of the film: 'Mickey Pearson, an American expat (Matthew McConaughey), tries to sell off his highly profitable marijuana empire in London, triggering plots, schemes, bribery and blackmail in an attempt to steal his domain out from under him.' Spin that idea over two hours of action in the Ritchie style and the story explodes like a July 4th evening of color and noise. The language is typically raw and predominantly profanity - and that fits the style of the story.The cast is a collection of some excellent actors: Hugh Grant 'narrates' much of the story to Ray (Charlie Hunnam), Mickey's consiglieri, and intertwines the myriad groups of eager procurers of McConaughey's marijuana estate - Jeremy Strong, Colin Farrell, Henry Golding, Tom Wu, Eddie Marsan, Jason Wong et al. Michelle Dockery is Mickey's hardnosed wife, the reason Mickey performs so well.At times the strained Cockney accents and other permutations of the English language seem forced (or simply undecipherable), but the action never stops, and the script contains some pungent ideas.

23,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Ritchie stays relevant with latest gangster offering,7,27 October 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMichael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is an American graduate of Oxford, who's built up a lucrative empire in the marijuana trade, and is planning to retire, with his partner Rosalind (Michelle Dockery.) His right hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) has been approached by sleazy journalist Fletcher (Hugh Grant), who thinks he's got the lowdown on a plot to overtake his empire, with Triad gangster Dry Eye (Henry Golding) at the helm, but the truth is more scattershot than he might have thought.Despite having made a name for himself in Hollywood, Guy Ritchie is still best known for his distinctive British gangster capers, of which The Gentlemen feels like an affectionate, retrospective throwback to. It's as if he didn't want to become detached from the formula that he set out with, and had to prove that he could still pull it off. The result is a serviceable, competent piece of work, though ultimately unremarkable, with a convoluted plot that does it no good.Ritchie has assembled an all star cast, ranging from American import McConaughey in the lead, and even established stars like Colin Farrell in a comic supporting role, while big British star Grant chews the scenery as a sleazy reporter, a subtle nod, no doubt, to his real life showdowns with the tabloids. It's all a big, glossy, polished affair, with the director's trademark humour still in dark abundance, just with something missing that means it doesn't hold up to his classic early work.In a day and age when crime thrillers have taken on a style all of their own, a new Guy Ritchie film truly stands alone as a particular type of affair. While The Gentlemen doesn't stand up to the quality of his early films, it's still a pleasing, darkly funny throwback to those days. ***",The Gentlemen
24,MOscarbradley,This is probably the best film I've seen so far this year.,9,26 April 2020,"Once upon a time this would have been called 'post-modern'; now it's just smarter than the smartest kid on the block and really terrific fun. It's a Guy Ritchie picture set in the heart of Guy Ritchie territory and it's like an amalgam of all the best Guy Ritchie pictures strung together. It starts with a killing...or does it and if so, who's been killed, before leaping forward to what's basically a pitch for the film we're watching being made by a very dodgy private investigator, (a never better Hugh Grant), to a well-heeled gangster, (Charlie Hunnam).Part of the fun is the way Ritchie subverts our expectations, not just in the torturous way he tells his tale, but in the casting. I mean, who would have imagined 'Downton Abbey's' Lady Mary, (a superb Michelle Dockery), playing a foul-mouthed Cockney moll or indeed Grant's terrific turn as a blackmailing scumbag. The rest of the cast can be taken as read; for the Ameriican market, Matthew McConaughey as Mr Big, Colin Farrell, (brilliant as 'The Coach'). Eddie Marsan as a sleazy newspaper magnate, 'Succession's Jeremy Strong as one of McConaughey's rivals and Henry Golding, getting better with every picture, as a small-time Asian gangster with big ideas.They are all wonderful, spouting some of the best dialogue of any Guy Ritchie film but then perhaps they had to be since the plot isn't that easy to follow, (everybody seems to be double-crossing everyone else), making this the only Guy Ritchie movie you will almost certainly need to see twice. I loved every fantastic, foul-mouthed minute.",The Gentlemen
25,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Play a game with me, Guy.",5,5 January 2020,"'The Gentlemen (2020)' is fine, consistently engaging and occasionally quite fun. It does have a plethora of problems, though. First of all, it's never quite clear just who we're supposed to be rooting for. This doesn't feel intentional and seems to be the result of its odd, flashback-based structure. There isn't a great sense of escalation and the pace remains mostly consistent. The narrative doesn't catch up with itself until far too late and, even then, it's annoying how most of the story is told via narrated exposition to someone apparently directly involved with most of its events. Secondly, the flick is simply an amalgamation of genre tropes and stock characters, almost exactly what you expect from a Guy Ritchie movie that isn't 'Aladdin (2019)'. The characters aren't really given the time necessary to develop properly; they're always walking stereotypes. Some of them even seem like stand-ins for the director himself, with talk of ""proper cinema"" and references to films like 'The Conversation (1973)' being ""a bit boring"". Finally, the flick is kind of racist. Almost every character makes some kind of racist remark, mainly against members of Asian and Black communities, and it's often used for supposed 'humour'. The worst offence is probably when a major character says another has a 'black heart' while specifically referencing race. The flick's treatment of women isn't much better, with the only female character coming under the threat of rape just so she can be violently saved by a white man. It all feels outdated, like someone scrambling against apparent 'PC gone mad'. Plus, a lot of time is strangely spent trying to justify its problematic elements; characters have discussions about whether or not certain racist remarks are actually racist. All of this results in an affair that only sours with time, staying in your mind just long enough for you to consider its faults and then slipping away into complete obscurity. It's really forgettable, probably because it's so generic. It's not terrible, though. As I mentioned, it's often quite enjoyable and it's always engaging. Hugh Grant's scene-stealing performance is a real highlight, too. It's messy and misjudged but it's entertaining enough to keep you in your seat. 5/10",The Gentlemen
26,dromasca,Guy Ritchie hits it right,8,28 February 2020,"All the films directed by Guy Ritchie over the last decade that I have seen have been disappointments to me, so I was very close to skip seeing 'The Gentlemen' in theaters, leaving it, maybe, for a later viewing. What convinced me in the end was the impressive note on IMDB (8.1). Over 40,000 film fan mates can't go wrong, I told myself, and I'm not sorry. 'The Gentlemen' is Ritchie's best film I remember ever seeing (but I should mention that I did not see 'Snatch' made at the beginning of his career, which I read a lot of good things about). 'The Gentlemen' is a violent action movie, stylish, funny, original, with a select cast. Those who don't like gangster movies would probably do well to avoid it, but all the other movie lovers have a lot of reasons to go and see it.Guy Ritchie is not a director who walks the beaten track. Even when he has an interesting and an already complicated story in his hand like 'The Gentlemen', he chooses to tell it in an unconventional way. In other films I had the impression that preoccupation with his own directorial vision spoils the effect, but here the convention created by him works very well. What we have in the film is a story about gangsters fighting for control over the narcotics manufacturing and distribution industry in today's England. An upper-class Mafia-style boss (Matthew McConaughey) plans to sell his business, and two rival gangs fight to get their hands on it. In addition to the fact that the story is quite complicated already, it is narrated in cinematic style by a blackmail journalist / detective (Hugh Grant), who beautifies it by presenting it in the form of ... a movie script. The pretext is created not only for a 'movie-in-movie' narrative, but also to permanently question what we see on the screen. Do we see what actually happened? Do we see a version invented or modified to serve the purposes of the blackmailer? Or maybe what we see is fiction, the fruit of a script writer's imagination?It will take the average viewer (the category I like to fall in) about 10-15 minutes to understand the unconventional way the story is told and get used to it. If he manages to cross this threshold, I think, there are enough moments of cinematic satisfaction and good quality entertainment in this film. The distribution is excellent. Matthew McConaughey transitions professionally from his roles as a good and handsome guy to the role here of a (very) bad and handsome guy. Hugh Grant already has 35 (!) years of career behind him, but it seems that he is only now maturing and moving from the beau roles to senior acting, and what an actor he is! I think part two of his career will be even better than the first. Nearly unrecognizable and just as good is Colin Farrell. The fourth ace in Ritchie's hand is Charlie Hunnam , an actor whom I know less, but who acts at parity with his famous partners. I was told that I should be familiar with Michelle Dockery , but I am not as I didn't see 'Downton Abbey', and I confess that she didn't impress me here. Certainly, in 'The Gentlemen', the male side rules. There are many memorable scenes in the film, especially those that rely on class differences, as they are expressed in language, behavior, and tools of violence. The scenario is very talkative, which may seem a little inappropriate because gangsters generally talk less and shoot more, but that's part of the convention. Finally, I can say that I liked 'The Gentlemen' and that the film has restored the stature of Guy Ritchie in my eyes.",The Gentlemen
27,ThomasDrufke,Not For Me,6,30 January 2020,"I think I've finally accepted that Guy Ritchie's style is simply not for me. While The Gentleman is very much an improvement on his version of King Arthur (which I liked more than most), it's still over-stylized, stuffed with over-the-top characters, convoluted storytelling, and just too much goofiness for my liking. Again, I can acknowledge that Ritchie is a very talented filmmaker, but I don't think his style is for me. Even his Sherlock films are a bit much at times. I tend to gravitate more to substance over style and not vice versa. With that said, there are several pretty dam* cool scenes that will excite fans of this style and I undeniably appreciated them. But they are few and far between.6.3/10",The Gentlemen
28,Cineanalyst,Guy Ritchie's The Player,8,9 August 2021,"A stylish, vernacular dialect-heavy gangster flick, ""The Gentlemen"" is very much in the tradition of Guy Ritchie's earliest acclaimed films, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998) and ""Snatch"" (2000). But, the storytelling devices here are more intricately reflexive, although his prior efforts are also known for their non-linear composition. As referenced above, it does what ""The Player"" (1992) did, with the script for the very movie we're watching being pitched within that movie, ""Bush,"" which was actually a working title, as written by Hugh Grant's character. Indeed, in the end, the script is pitched to Miramax and Ritchie himself, the actual producer and author of the movie. The entire picture is a deconstruction of itself, as well as this type of Ritchie production--revealing and reveling in the filmmaking processes and the convoluted criminal operations.""The Player"" and ""The Gentlemen"" are only two examples of this device. The earliest such instance in a film that I recall is interesting and, perhaps, telling. ""The Mystery of the Leaping Fish"" (1916) ended in similar fashion, with its star Douglas Fairbanks pitching the scenario to the studio. Both pictures involve that vice of drugs, as one particular conversation in ""The Gentlemen"" elaborates upon, in their plotting. Here, it's a marijuana kingpin and a struggle over his empire; in the Fairbanks vehicle, it's a cocaine-fueled, among other narcotics, detective. The silent film, of course, was a Sherlock Holmes parody. Given that Ritchie has made two Sherlock Holmes movies, perhaps it's not inconceivable that he's seen ""The Mystery of the Leaping Fish,"" despite its relative obscurity due to being a silent film from 1916.There's more to the reflexivity, though. Hugh Grant also stands in as the in-film surrogate camera(man), spying for a tabloid owner, taking photographs and recording video. He runs lines with Charlie Hunnam in one scene. They compete over narrator (un)reliability, for control of the movie. Heck, even those glasses they wear tend to reflect the equipment employed to make the movie. There are also the ""fight porn"" videos as films-within-the-film. That's in addition to the aspect ratio fluctuations and showing the celluloid (I seem to recall there's a German word for that, but I forget it) in fourth-wall-breaking fashion as Grant discusses filmmaking craft, albeit his celebration of celluloid seems odd in a movie that I believe--correct me if I'm wrong (as it's sometimes hard to tell when every film ends up digital anyways)--was shot digitally. I get that it's an homage to a vintage style, as this entire movie is vintage Guy Ritchie, but still, I miss celluloid. It's not unlike, say, ""The Conversation"" (1973), the ""it's a bit boring"" film referenced at one point, showing its soundtrack--indeed, making the film about it--in the film itself. ""The Gentlemen"" is more ""The Conversation"" than ""The Godfather"" films in that way.In the sidelong glance (Grant) at a sidelong glance (Hunnam) in the picture's schema of its central character played by Matthew McConaughey, it's the periphery characters played by Grant and, in an especially superfluous role, Colin Farrell who steal the show. Too bad neither received any awards attention. I think Grant really has the most interesting role here, being charged with the construction of the meta narrative and afforded to be sleazy without the macho facade of the rest, and Farrell's line readings are the best. Of the main characters, his is the least inherently intriguing or necessary, so it was all on him to make the part fascinating, and, come to think of it, he affects less machismo than others, too, despite playing another tough-guy type role--instead employing the brutality in a caretaker capacity for the youths in his charge. When his Coach fights off a bunch of knife-wielding kids, he simultaneously and humorously exploits it as a teachable moment for them. Hunnam, meanwhile, seems to have merely changed outfits to play the same basic role he did over seven seasons of ""Sons of Anarchy,"" and now that we're accustomed to McConaughey not being a mere rom-com personality, this role doesn't appear challenging. He delivers monologues about being the king or whatever with the same gusto, or lack thereof, as those pretentious Lincoln car commercials.One more self-referential aspect here of Ritchie's oeuvre that's worth reflecting upon are the jokes here involving race and sexuality. I didn't think much of it watching the movie--just that they were comical asides. That Grant's character seems to be a bit of a predatory gay trope, but even that didn't cause much more than a raised eyebrow from me in a picture full of reprobates, including a heterosexual rape attempt, as well as the implication of what was done to a pig. As for race, there's a brief gag of a crime-movie Asian stereotype, for instance, there's Hunnam's character musing about ""white guilt"" at one point, and Farrell's Coach arguing at another to a young black boxer that a remark of him being ""black"" isn't racist. Again, nothing much there within the context of the picture itself except as perhaps a commentary on varying racial attitudes among such a cast of characters. But, then, I read some reviews for ""The Gentlemen,"" and, wow, what a self-righteous lot entertainment critics can be--and dull. I mean, obviously, Ritchie like every other filmmaker has his perspective and his films may appeal to one demographic over another, as with all films, so it seems rather witless to focus reviews on that when there's much more aesthetically and cinematically interesting going on. For one, in this light, those scenes are but another reflexive device, of a defense against or rebuttal to criticism of Richie's oeuvre, from Brad Pitt as a gypsy to ""The Gentlemen.""",The Gentlemen

Unusual twists (enough that I was getting lost/confused/caught off guard) to an otherwise typical crime genre movie.

One less star because the scene jumps, although an integral part of the overall structure of the story, seemed excessive & confusing at times.",The Gentlemen
32,The-Sarkologist,True to Ritchie's Style,8,10 January 2020,"Well, it certainly seems as if Guy Ritchie has got his groove back, but then again I am one of those people that feel that he never quite lost it, namely because I did quite like King Arthur. Anyway, with this film he is back in familiar territory, namely the English Criminal underworld with a cast of anti-heroes. Yeah, that is the type of film that I loved, and this one, well, this one certainly doesn't disappoint.So, we have this American, Mickey Pearson, that won a Rhodes Scholarship and moved over to England. However, while at university he got into the drug dealing scene, namely marijuana, and he basically never looked back (oh, did I mention that he was also studying botany - why not?). However, the movie shifts to a time where he has decided that he will retire and wants to off load his business.That is basically all I am going to tell you about the plot, though I have to admit the his syndicate is really craftily constructed because, well, being a former Oxbridge student means that he made some pretty good connections, and he also learnt how to move in their world, which basically sets himself up among the upper classes of England.One of the great things I love about Ritchie's films is that he doesn't shy away from the use of accents. Yeah, we hear the English, Cockney, and American accents quite well - I suspect that he does this on purpose. Yet, in another way it not only adds a lot of shine to the film, but it also gives the characters greater depth than those films were the actors do away with them.Oh, and I should mention that true to Ritchie's style, there are lots of twists and turns in the film, and of course a lot of black comedy. Sure, it ain't no Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but if you loved that film then you are probably going to really enjoy this one as well. Honestly, expect the unexpected.",The Gentlemen

Hugh Grant's accent was not as annoying as the trailer (thank God) and he is clearly having fun camping it up, whilst Henry Golding does his best to keep up.It has a great energy and the dialogue is wonderful (it got some huge laughs).

The movie is surprisingly good with a witty script that is filled with humor; a story that is filled with twists and turns, and a huge cast ensemble which everyone does a great job in their characters. I did think the movie was kind of boring in the first half hour until it picks up. The movie is not in a chronological order.The plot follows Reporter Fletcher (Hugh Grant) breaks into Raymond's (Charlie Hunnam) home. Requesting a lot of money in exchange for a return that Raymond's boss Mickey (Matthew McConaughey) and his organization of pot dealing story does not get sold to a movie studio. Fletcher and Raymond go over the story on what happened in the past. With Mickey wanting to retire from his organization. Which Dry Eye (Henry Golding) is trying to buy his organization but Mickey refuses. Creating a conflict with Dry Eye. Meanwhile, Coach (Colin Farrell) and his group of young adults accidently breaks into Mickey's plant farm. While Raymond is trying to get everything settled with dealing any conflict that Mickey has.It was a good story. It was all over the place. From the perspectives as Fletcher was talking to Raymond about in the beginning of the movie. There is a scene that Fletcher wrote a screen play from when he was spying on Matthew (Jeremy Strong) and Dry eye. Which he has himself and Raymond acting it out. It was funny and stupid. The film does have some fun humor. Then, there are some dark and serious moments which can be tough to watch.The cast ensemble is great with the movie. Matthew McConaughey takes the lead playing Mickey. There are some powerful moments when a dramatic tension leads him to fighting back. Charlie Hunnam was great. Henry Golding was good playing Dry Eye. Rosalind who is Mickey's wife played by Michelle Dockery is also good as well. Jeremy Strong and Eddie Marsan are good. Colin Farrell was good and funny with his character. Hugh Grant almost unrecognizable playing Fletcher was funny and good.Guy Ritchie direction and script delivered a gangster drama movie with witty dialogue, narrative, and humor. It is what you can expect in a Guy Ritchie's movie. There are some over dramatic moments with a powerful music score by Christopher Benstead.Overall, The Gentlemen is a good action crime film.

38,eddie_baggins,Ritchie is back doing what he does best,7,7 January 2020,"When weighed up directly against the beloved staples of Guy Ritchie's filmography, Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, the charismatic directors newest film The Gentlemen is not even in the same league but as a refreshing return to his roots, this newest crime caper (proudly bought to you by the Lonsdale clothing company) is still a whole lot of fun should you go along for the ride.After a relatively forgettable decade or so that saw commercial hit Aladdin but a fair share of failures including King Arthur and The Man From Uncle, Gentlemen sees Ritchie return to the genre that made his name stand out from the crowd for the first time since 2008's RocknRolla and it's great to see the visually talented and energetic creative back on deck in a universe of British crims that he knows so well.Recruiting an all star cast led by American import Matthew McConaughey as marijuana kingpin Mickey Pearson, Charlie Hunnam as the softly spoken steak loving Raymond and a scene stealing Hugh Grant as slimy investigator/paparazzi fiend Fletcher, Gentlemen has Ritchie and his players navigate a rather complicated crime yarn that doesn't always gel together efficiently but when it does, you're quickly reminded as to why you feel in love with Ritchie crime capers in the first place.With Raymond and Fletcher telling the films story over a long night time set conversation, Gentlemen takes us on a ride through the underbelly of British crime tropes as we visit drug dens, soccer matches, royal estates, corner pubs and more tea connoisseurs than a Tetly convention and while the yarn is perhaps less action packed and visually inventive than we've come to expect from Ritchie offerings, the director's trademark character creation and dialogue work is still a cut above the usual.With barely a moments respite, Ritchie keeps things moving at a rapid pace as additional players like Colin Farrel's Coach, Henry Goldings criminal upstart Dry Eye and Michelle Dockery's fiery Rosalind partake in proceedings that give you little time to think or ask questions about what you are seeing, other than the fact it's all done in a tongue in cheek way that shows off the fun side of Ritchie that is what we love most about the British wunderkind.The journey of Gentlemen may never end up taking us to the outstanding destination or culmination that we hope for as we watch a bunch of deceiving and scheming players act up around the sale of Mickey Pearson's criminal enterprise but there's little denying the fact that the easy to watch, curse-ridden and well played out journey we partake in is a thoroughly enjoyable one, without ever becoming a downright memorable one.Final Say -It's great to see Guy Ritchie back doing what he does best and while The Gentlemen never reaches the dazzling heights of the directors best works, this is a step back in the right direction for a filmmaker who had lost his sense of purpose.3 1/2 parachutes out of 5",The Gentlemen
39,leonblackwood,Not that memorable! 5/10,5,2 September 2020,"Review:
When I heard that Guy Ritchie had returned to his old style of directing with this movie, I was excited to see it, especially when I heard that Hugh Grant was playing a cockney geezer, but I must admit, I was pretty disappointed with the final product. It didn't have that funny and clever wit, that we have all grown to love from Guy Ritchie's earlier films, and the swearing seemed inappropriate and over the top in places. The back and forth of the storyline spoilt the flow of the film, and it felt messy in places. Although people were praising the cast's performances, I thought that all of them was a weird choice for there roles, and I must admit, I fell asleep halfway through the film. There were a couple of strokes of genius, like the freezer scene towards the end, and when McConaughey saved his wife, but most of it wasn't that memorable. Personally, I would have used Colin Farell's character much more throughout the film, and there should have been more character building because I couldn't care less who lived or died. It really reminded me of Get Shorty, in terms of McConaughey trying to correct his mistakes in life, but the fact that comedy element was missing, really let the movie down. In all, it's another one watch in my eyes, and I personally think that Guy Ritchie has lost his touch. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Guy Ritchie, who also brought you Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Swept Away, Revolver, RocknRolla, Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the Man from U.N.C.L.E., King Arthur and Aladdin. Like Quentin Tarantino, he seems to have lost his passion for movie making of late, after a boost to the big time with his earlier movies, and I personally can't see him making another film that will touch them. As for this movie, he did try his utmost to bring back the golden years, with the cockney gangsters and heavy soundtrack, but it was a right mess. With another Aladdin movie in the pipeline, along with 2 other films called Empire Rising and Cash Truck, I personally can't see them pushing him back into the big leagues, which is a shame because I can still watch his earlier movies, over and over again.Budget: $22million

It simply does NOT want to stop being smart , ending up being boring after half an hour of SMART talk and more smart talk....",5,15 February 2020,"Director Guy Ritchie shot to fame around the year 2000 with 1 terrific, hilarious gangster movie (""Snatch"", a MUST SEE), but since then he has faded into oblivion as a director. This new story is pretty complicated, weird AND VERY English and full of blunt dialogues the masses probably wont like. And I did not like it either, after a promising smart start...Any bad? Yes. It's way too smart. It simply does NOT want to stop being smart , ending up being boring after half an hour of smart gangster talk.More bad: The story of this movie is about Hugh Grant LITERALLY constantly telling / reciting a gangster screenplay to another gangster. Quirky? Yes. Original? Yes. Interesting? NO!Any good? Brilliant acting performances all around though, especially Hugh Grant is quite surprisingly good in his role as a gangster. He truly pulls it off to look menacing, in a true GENTLEMEN kind of way, hence title...Conclusion: ultimately it is still quite boring. Too much TALK TALK TALK. Too little REAL gangster action or drama or suspense.",The Gentlemen
43,southdavid,"I keep getting older, they stay the same.",8,13 January 2020,"I approached this one with a degree of scepticism. I felt the trailer was awful, and having lived through the boom of awful British Gangster movies that followed ""Lock Stocks"" success and wasn't particularly interested in more Mockney accented violence. So, it's remarkable then that ""The Gentlemen"" won me over.Investigative journalist Fletcher (Hugh Grant) lays out his upcoming expose' about Marijuana baron Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) to Pearson's consiglieri Ray (Charlie Hunnam) in an attempt to secure a bribe to kill the story. Pearson is looking to retire and sell his production and distribution networks to Matthew (Jeremy Strong) but his decision has encouraged other players in the market to step up.The humour was eventually the Trojan horse that won me over. It took a while to warm to Hugh Grant's Fletcher, so camp and letchy it's somehow so far beyond the realms of offensive and back out the other side, that you can't help but laugh at some of the things he says - and that's true of a lot of the film, plenty of moments in isolation would be appalling, but somehow the sheer volume of swearwords, stereotypes and violence overwhelms those feelings to the point you can't begin to take it seriously and start to laugh. And crucially, it's 'with' the film, rather than 'at' it. All this feels like a deliberate choice, rather than an accident - which I think stems from the fact that Ritchie was doing this two decades ago.It doesn't all work though. Charlie Hunnam is as terrible here as he is in everything but this time is saddled by an accent that could be . . .well, anything really . . . Welsh? The twists towards the end are a little more predictable than I would have liked and I'm not sure my justifications from the previous paragraph works for the potential rape scene.That said, I enjoyed the film, as did the majority of the screening that I was in, based on the laughs - and Colin Farrell earns a whole star here just on his own.",The Gentlemen

This takes place in London where we meet wealthy businessman, Michael Pearson (McConaughey) who is thinking about selling his Marijuana plant to the highest bidder. Soon, things get intense when people star killing, bribing, and trying to steal from underneath him. Dockery (Downton Abbey) plays Michael's wife, Rosalind, Farrell (The Recruit) plays Coach and Grant (Nine Months) plays Fletcher.

46,jtindahouse,Ritchie returns to the crime genre and does so masterfully,9,1 January 2020,"Has there ever been a bad performance in a Guy Ritchie movie? If there has I haven't noticed it. He has an ornate ability to take average actors and make them great, and to take already great actors and get even more out of them. There are a few directors around who specialise in this but Ritchie is right near the top. The cast in 'The Gentlemen' is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn't change the fact that they are an absolute treat to watch. Matthew McConaughey is in his element in a role that he was born to play, Charlie Hunnam plays one of the coolest characters I've seen perfectly, Colin Farrell is hilarious and ridiculously cool as well and then Hugh Grant gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from him. In fact Grant was so good I didn't even recognise his voice and had to wonder if they'd dubbed it. They hadn't, he'd just nailed it.The style this movie possesses is just so much fun to watch. If you've seen any of Ritchie's previous similar films ('Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Snatch', 'RocknRolla') then you know what I'm talking about. The pacing moves at lightning speed, the dialogue is quick, clever and deeper than you first realise and the conflict is always multi-layered. This one is actually told in quite a unique way with a couple of characters going over events that have already happened and it works masterfully. It breaks the story up and gives room for creativity in the story-telling process and also humour.Every time I see that Ritchie has made a movie that isn't a crime-thriller I get a little disappointed. It's not that the other stuff he's doing is bad ('Swept Away' being an obvious exception), it's just that he is so damn good as this style of movie. He's the best in the business and if he only did these for the rest of his career I'd be a very happy man. This is an excellent movie well worth your time and money.",The Gentlemen

Matthew decides to go with the Englishman but it doesn't sit well with Henry. Hugh plays a reporter that is looking for a big payday by selling information he has dug up to the highest bidder-he has dirt on several players.

50,alindsay-al,A Great fun gangster film,8,28 May 2020,"This film was one of those that came out earlier this year and actually made it to the cinema but I missed it and now I have seen The Gentlemen and here is my review for the film. The premise sees an American drug manufacturer looking to sell his business in London which leads to many different parties looking to get involved.
Main Character
Matthew McConaughey plays the lead in this film and you can tell he really thrives in this role. He is intimdiating and charming mixed into one to make him this interesting character, you don't learn too much about him but that adds a bit to the mystique to his performance and he is just fun to watch.
Supporting Characters
This film has a big cast and everyone does a good job, Charlie Hunnam plays a big part in the film and I thought he was good. He has his usual gruff here but he actually had quite a bit of personality in this film and again he just looked like he was having plenty of fun here. Hugh Grant has a big role and he is brilliant here, he like transforms here, if nobody told me this was Hugh Grant I would not have suspected it at all. He is funny and sarcastic with him really guiding us the audience through the film and really does a great job in leading us through the journey. Colin Farrell is also really good in this film, he is incredibly funny and charming, plus he is a really menacing but likeable presence which adds plenty to the film.
Story
The positives for the story is that it is presented and told in a pretty unique way which suprised me and kept me on my toes. It also moves very quickly making you wonder what crazy thing is going to happen next which is something most films can't do. However, the actual plot is pretty basic, there isn't much unique about it, there are some gangsters and deals and backstabbings that you aren't that unpredictable plus a few of them could have been cut out in order to make the better parts of the plot more interesting.
Script
The script has plenty of quick witted and sharp dialogue, the humour is there to make these funny characters and add to the hyper reality that is on show. Though the dramatic dialogue was lacking for me, I wasn't sure why the characters fully cared about each other or felt there lives were in danger because the film doesn't take the time to focus on it.
Style
The style of the film is great, it is ridiculous and over the top, it has violence throughout which is to be expected and as mentioned it moves really quickly which does keep you interested throughout.
Overall
Overall, this is a real return ro form for Guy Ritchie and it is a great watch which is full of fun and worth a watch if you like this style of film.",The Gentlemen

When it leaks out that he is thinking of getting out, numerous plots are hatched to determine who gets what. The story of what is happening is told to McConaughey's right hand man, Hunman by creepy private eye Grant who expects to receive a lot of money for not leaking the story.This is Ritchie on familiar British gangster territory coupled with his penchant for creating wonderfully eccentric characters who spurt out endless witty lines punctuated with moments of strong violence. Grant is on the top of the pile here and pretty much steals the show, but Farrell and Dockery are also great fun playing very much against type and McConaughey is a good solid lead.As with all of Ritchie's films. this is a tad complex and some of it doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, but it's a lot of fun with plenty of twists and turns and moves along at an enjoyably swift pace.",The Gentlemen

The way Guy Ritchie creates it's characters is just a class.Matthew McConaghey does pure justice with his character of a drug mafia and his baritone voice does the rest magic. Charlie Hunnam as his right hand man is not like other henchmen who are ready to fire bullets here and there but is a very calm and cleans the mess created because of the business with an elegance. Hugh Grant in the role of a blackmailing private investigator does his job with an ease. Colin Farrell in the role of a boxing coach of some rowdy boys is an endearing.

55,arthur_tafero,Good Film; Terrible Ending,6,29 January 2020,"Ritchie and McConeghy have one thing in common; they are both afraid to take chances. They always take the easy, predictable way out. This film is a perfect example. Except for Gold, McConeghy has never really taken many chances with his characters in previous films, and it this one, he is highly predictable as well. There was a a moment when the film could have been as good as The Long Good Friday, but that moment was lost rather quickly with the ridiculous ending. Both Ritchie and McConeghy opted for the Hollywood happy ending syndrome, instead of a more realistic film. Too bad, it could have been a classic.",The Gentlemen

Charlie Hunnam is Raymond, Mickey's right-hand man, along with Colin Farrell (leader of an incompetent small gang) he gets the best lines in the movie.

The jokes aren't funny, the whole movie's humor is based around racist and sexual jokes... The plot is quite simple and all the characters are unlikeable, like I didn't care for any of the characters. Also, the rape scene was so out of the place.

Always, I felt, being a traveler in the world of warmed over Tarantino, Ritchie always had a muscular presence behind the camera (he can put together a vibrant soundtrack like Q as well) but his overwritten monologues for his working class thugs has always struck me as great audition pieces for actors (which this film boasts a ton of like Matthew McConaughey, Henry Golding, Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant, Charlie Hunnam & Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery) but as plots go, Ritchie has done this before maybe better but definitely the same & this tale of a battle for a weed farmer's territory & the ensuing crosses & double crosses which follow starts to wear on the viewer's nerves than tickle their cinematic funny bones.",The Gentlemen

There's not a single bad performance to be found really. There are a few that go above and beyond but everyone is solid. The movie is funny, clever, violent and terribly entertaining.Still, it's not without imperfections. There'sa few instances where we could have really benefited from subtitles. It also has a few cheats and conveniences in the plot. Oh, and it's pretty darn racist at times too. There's also a moment that's so meta it popped me out of the movie pretty heavily.Negatives aside, this was still a fun experience.

61,aidanratesmovies,"Gentlemen, well done",9,28 April 2020,"A well crafted, fun, and very engaging romp- Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen may start out slow, but it finishes with more than just a bang. The film for the most part is acted very very well, with Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, and Collin Farrel all deserving some major recognition for their roles. The only performance I had a problem with was that of Hugh Grant's, who I felt was a bit over-the-top in the opposite way which Richie was trying to convey in the film, not to mention he is pretty damn annoying. Nevertheless, this fact, and the fact that the film does take a little while to get its own engines running, are the film's biggest flaws. The film can be very funny when it needs to be, and increasingly entertaining as the film and the world surrounding the characters we are falling begins to unravel. Guy Ritchie is able to balance all these tones fairly well, and it is this, and the fact that the film keeps its head after pulling so many twists, that I remain utterly impressed with it after my viewing. In the end, The Gentlemen is not Richie's best, but it is certainly something to be proud of, and is certainly worth a watch (or two) if you get the chance.
My Rating: 8.75/10",The Gentlemen
62,truemythmedia,Perfectly Average,5,30 January 2020,"I think Guy Ritchie is a competent director. Early in his career he made some very entertaining comedic gangster flicks (""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", ""Snatch""- I even think ""RocknRolla"" is alright); and I think his blockbusters are entertaining as well (the ""Sherlock Holmes"" series; and make fun of me if you want, but though ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" was absolutely ridiculous, I thought it was also a lot of b-movie fantasy fun). When I saw the trailer for this movie I actually got excited, because though I think Ritchie's PG-13 blockbusters are fine, he really shines when he's working with incredibly foul-mouthed, violent and eccentric gangsters. I hoped this film would be a triumphant return to form.While ""The Gentlemen"" is certainly a return to form, but it's not triumphant; it's pretty average.",The Gentlemen
63,valleyjohn,Welcome back Guy Ritchie,8,6 February 2020,"I was listening to the review of The Gentlemen by British film critic Mark Kermode the other day and he said , that Guy Ritchie had taken two steps backwards by reverting to making the type of movie he made at the beginning of his career . I couldn't disagree more. Lock Stock and Snatch are two of my favourite movies of all time and when i heard Ritchie was going back to his British gangster roots i couldn't have been more happier .This is the story of Mickey Pearson is an American who became rich by building a marijuana empire in London. When word gets out that he's looking to cash out of the business, it soon triggers an array of plots and schemes from those who want his fortune.Firstly i'll say that The Gentlemen isn't quite up to the standard of Snatch or Lockstock but it does have a better story line than both of those films.
Some of the characters are superb and the stand out performers are Hugh Grant as Fletcher , who ironically plays a sleazy journalist and Colin Farrell who plays coach who runs a boxing club . I found the first hour lacking a little in humour but as the story unfolds , so do the laughs and the action.If i had be critical i would say that Mathew McConaughey probably looks a little bit out of place in the film. It feels like he was cast to put a big American name on the poster . Another problem i have is Charlie Hunnam . The man cannot do accents ( Just watch Green Street!) . I have no idea what accent he was attempting here but it sounded like a mixture of Liverpudlian , Cockney , Yorkshire and American .I really enjoyed The Gentlemen and i hope Guy Ritchie sticks to what he does best in the future and takes no notice of the sniffy critics . I have the feeling this is one of those movies that i'll enjoy watching multiple times over the years as i tend to do with Guy Ritchie's work.",The Gentlemen
64,AudioFileZ,Excellent Dark Comedic Crime Story,9,15 February 2020,"Ritchie has previously gone a bit toward a ridiculous level in his dark crime comedies in the past. Sure, the were good watches, but you needed a big non and wink. Not this time though. It's a very matured Ritchie film digging from his past while taking a much more intelligent path. This crime doesn't need that nod and a wink to digest. Dare I say it has some gripping moments? In for a penny and in for a pound here. It will get you early and it doesn't have silly or weak moments. I'm sure there's plenty of reviews regarding the cast so all I'll say is everyone nails their parts properly in addition to a story that seems plausible. Yes, it has a device of a reporter character played by Hugh Grant telling the story in order to line his own pockets. Grant is even glib, smarmy, and narcissistic without any of his usual cutesy schtick. Matthew McConaughey continues to impress and Colin Farrell is excellent in every scene. It's a violent, it's politically incorrect, yet it doesn't pander as it all fits in the story being told. The best film in the Ritchie canon and, probably, the best in the genre. It will keep you watching right up until the end which is actually quite satisfying and excellent too.",The Gentlemen

SUMMARYWhen it comes to the British writing style, this reviewer always looks to the potential for balanced writing. Sure enough, this is one of the times where the writing is truly representative of a master writer in multiple facets. This tale contains some amazing humor to it, not so much in the form of slapstick, one liner filled form, but a much deeper levels that uses timing, setting, and wit to maximize the laughs. It's dry I'll admit, but the humor goes so well with the plot at hand that it adds rather than distracts from the enriching plot that this film contains. With this supporting component, the movie continues to get better in the way it balances so many things to make an engaging mafia tale. First the character usage, the movie is filled with a lot of stars and they are utilized very well, with so many (including secondary characters) having a purpose and contribute to the film in a way or manner to make their inclusion worthy. While it seems spotty at first the movie's progression begins to start connecting all the players in the game, starting to unravel and help give pieces of the story without ever giving away the big mystery. It's this balance of connections with the mystery that for me was the biggest engaging piece to the movie, that teasing to see how deep the politics run always being that itch you can't scratch. Yet, for a movie about crime lords, you know politics is going to make an appearance and once more they impressed me with the presentation. Again choppy, The Gentleman appealed to me because the politics had heat, tension, but were not so drawn out and convoluted to be boring, something not easily accomplished in this day and age for a movie. Yet if that's not interesting enough, the movie also manages to sneak in a more unique presentation, told through the imagination and sleuth of Hugh Grant's character, who is filling the pieces with his evidence and theories to help piece the story together. The genius for me is, the holes he has acts as the missing pieces for you to try and string together the ideas yourself before the big reveal. You might also be concerned for violence, after all, the crime lords with this much power do not show the nicest attitudes to those that threaten them. Fortunately, the movie manages to censor most of the extreme violence and torture that these movies can be famous for, and this little extra class did not take from the movie, but only added. Finally, all of this is fantastically acted, with each major character executing their role in so many levels I could take another page to describe. Let's just say McConaughey has found a new favorite role for me, finally ditching the super sleazy for a role that is much more complete to show off his talents. Hunnam as well was indeed a fantastic pillar character, filled with a level of emotional complexity that seems to be so monotone, but yet contains layers that unravel. I did not find too many overacted moments and was very thrilled with seeing so many stars shine.Yet, there are still some styles of this movie that did not quite hit me as hard as the others, at least in terms of liking it. First of all the cursing. Old record, I know, and given my own mouth sometimes it's becoming less, but there are a few words used freely in this movie that were a bit excessive. Part of the culture, great, but like in Django overuse of the word soon starts to become lazy and stale for this writer. While I enjoyed much of the toned-down storytelling, I'm always partial to a bit more excitement to help spice up the mob war films. A shoot out here or there could go a long way but the satire and humor in this film sort of dilutes the action that starts forming, before dropping back into the mincing tactics. Anyway, looking at the character profiling, the film is both genius and frustrating for me in its generational portrayal, with the contenders for the crown. At the same time the stereotypical summaries of each generation are little overdramatic and extreme, leading to sort of annoying moments that weren't the worst, but felt a little out of place (this is especially true for Henry Goulding's character). I'll admit there are also some bloated moments in the film, but these are few and far between and as stated, a little swap out with some action could have helped with these moments, again few and far between. Finally, the part that really stuck out for me was the rapping. Kudos for the art behind it, the impressive speed at which they rap, and the dance stunts in the back, but that's about all I'm going to say in terms of appropriate. When the video first appears it sort of does not make sense, but thankfully the writing uses it as a good plot device to help make up for how forced and advertising it seems. Like I said earlier, it's a generational stereotype that was a bit annoying to watching and were probably the most annoying characters of the bunch, despite having some of the coolest moves. Again, thank goodness for the writing making up for them. Sadly, the other thing that was both funny, yet again excessive is the ending, a few fake out and extension that almost feel like last minute tag-ons that may or may not have been needed.The VERDICT:To be honest, I was very surprised with how much I enjoyed this movie and how much the trailers did not ruin the experience for me. British settings, humor, and styles of writing continue to prove successful in balancing a lot of balls and I'm super impressed with how much correlated together in this piece. The drama, the mystery, the presentation, and the politics are all super well represented in this gang war, never getting so caught up in details to be boring, but not slighted to feel robbed of good development. That unique presentation we talked about only further adds some fun edges to it, and works with the gaps to help keep you engrossed. Finally, the actors really bring the characters to life and worthy of several awards with how well they bring these strange characters to some cool levels. Yes, the writing is still a little overdone at times, there are some annoying moments/stereotypes to consider, and a few slow parts that could have been ironed out. However, the balance of this movie and just fun, classy writing really make this one a worthy trip to watch in theater for performances, and a definite check in at home when you get the chance.My scores are:Action/Crime: 8.0 (not as much action)
Movie Overall: 7.5 - 8.0",The Gentlemen

And no, it doesn't include Sting, Alan Ford, Jason Statham, or Vinnie Jones in its cast (I kinda wish it did). ""Gentlemen"" is about a once poverty-stricken American who sells off his marijuana enterprise only to get a bunch of criminal blokes who want to steal it from him profit free.Released in London via December of last year and featuring a persona named Dry Eye (that's so Ritchie), ""Gentlemen"" has director Guy Ritchie in held back, gangster reserved mode. It's not as violent as I thought it would be nor is it as fresh (or nasty). Yup, ""Gentlemen"" is a bona fide, Ritchie retread. Too bad it lacks the snap, crackle, and pop of his earlier stuff (Snatch, Sherlock Holmes, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels).Starring the likes of Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell, and Hugh Grant (who are all quite good), The Gentlemen has plenty of jump cuts, actors with thick British accents, spit-fire dialogue, numerous flashbacks, a sloppy narrative, and plenty of good old Ritchie speak (""lovely"", ""double bubble"", ""bullocks"", ""on the tele""). ""Gentlemen"" also contains too many characters that fade in and out and shoot-'em-up scenes that build dramatic momentum only to come to a screeching halt.For me, Guy Ritchie has enough cinematic trickery up his sleeve and enough spent energy for five filmmakers. He's like the United Kingdom's version of Quentin Tarantino and/or Marty Scorsese. Pity that he's not much a storyteller because The Gentlemen is a little ponderous, a little shilly-shally, and all over the map. When the end credits for ""Gentlemen"" come up you hear the song ""That's Entertainment"" by The Jam. That's funny because the word entertainment and the bulk of The Gentlemen don't quite gel. Rating: 2 and a half stars for well, the empty style points and the lush UK interiors.",The Gentlemen
68,justin-fencsak,"After the huge hit of Aladdin, Ritchie gets back to basics",10,26 January 2020,"Last year, Aladdin the remake came out of nowhere to become Guy Ritchie's most popular movie of all time. His next movie? A return to classic Ritchie movies, the Gentlemen, a low budget crime movie starring an American (Matthew McConoaghey) and many familiar British stars. There's comedy, love, suspense, and tons of action. Go see this movie on the big screen if you can.",The Gentlemen
69,vengeance20,A Solid Crime Thriller,8,7 January 2020,"Just came back from seeing this tonight & must say it was pretty damn good!The film follows a wealthy man who wants to sell off his marijuana business but the rival gangs & mobsters are trying to steal/sabotage the business & of course kill off the man himself. The film starts off with Fletcher who tells the story like that of a screen play pitch, but this film has more layers than an Onion as more & more revelations to the story start to unfold.I found the film to be pretty entertaining & enticing. The film features the typical gangster elements seen in other films of its type, mixed in with some humourous & dark moments too. The dialogue & witty banter heard in the film was good. The story telling kept you locked in from start to finish.While the film is solid, there is a lot of details & plots points going on so prepare yourself when watching as it has many layers to the overall synopsis.Overall a solid crime thriller. 8/10",The Gentlemen

I would love to give Hugh Grant an award after all he was robbed last year in Paddington 2, he was great here, quite a revelation, but the vehicle that contained his brilliance was flawed.",The Gentlemen
74,cricket30,This film demonstrates the urgent need for EVERY World Citizen . . .,8,4 February 2020,". . . to go through life packing heat with a ""lock, stock and two smoking barrels"" attitude. ""Rosalind Pearson"" could have exited THE GENTLEMEN as a diminished ""sadder but wiser"" wench, were she not wise enough (to begin with) to have her trusty Derringer loaded and ready for the rapacious attack of ""Dry Eye"" and his two thugs in under-gunned England. Though her lead is so tiny that Rosalind can only dispatch two of these miscreants with a pair of mini-rounds, fortunately this delaying tactic allows her husband ""Mickey"" to show up in time to blast Dry Eye to Kingdom Gun BEFORE he's able to get ""in like Flynn"" with Rosalind. Then when the Russian KGB is about to snuff Mickey with ordinary handguns, Coach's boys show up packing multiple military-style assault rifles to give these Red Commie Kremlin-sent killers the kiss off of Death. Maybe more than any recent flick, THE GENTLEMEN illustrates why EVERYBODY needs to lug around as many shooting irons as possible--the bigger the better! As Mrs. Gump once told Forrest, ""Life is like a box of chocolates, and you MUST be able to hit each one from 50 paces in less than a minute!""

75,leftbanker-1,Affected Accents Are Almost Always Annoying And Asinine,6,26 March 2020,"Why does everyone speak with a funny voice in this? The worst accent goes to Matthew McConaughey who I assume was going for Little Lord Fauntleroy or Oliver Twist in a grade school drama production. His wife, the cockney mob moll, was way too much of a cliché. I blame the director for all of these annoyances because it's his film.He was going for stylish and campy, but it was cartoonish and unconvincing. His use of timeline irregularities was also annoying; the whole unreliable narration thing has been over-done to death.I was never convinced of the protagonist was capable of ruling over a pot empire, and how he built it wasn't realistic in the least. If you think about his grand plan for even a second, it makes zero sense.There sure was a lot of blood, blood everywhere. He must have bought fake blood in fifty gallon drums.Not the director's best.",The Gentlemen

77,Xstal,Mildly Entertaining...,6,26 April 2020,... but ultimately a valueless piece of cinema or film. There are far better purveyors of mindless violence around if that's your thing - unoriginal and nothing you haven't seen before. Poor person's Tarantino at best.,The Gentlemen
78,antoniotierno,good return from Guy Ritchie,7,5 March 2020,"Guy Ritchie returns to the atmosphere of his first few movies with The Gentlemen, wherein violence and chaos form a succesfull . The director, maybe predictably, gives The Gentlemen an opening stretch that overwhelms the public with exposition and context. Clear, certainly, that the barrage of information is a bit and requires a fair amount of patience from the viewer. The Gentlemen then follows into a progressively enthralling midsection which boasts one captivating sequence after another. The thoroughly watchable atmosphere is undoubtedly heightened by top-tier work of the movie's eclectic cast, and by the time all the pieces fall into place within the rather spellbinding climax.",The Gentlemen
79,Sergiodave,Guy Richie's best in years.,8,11 June 2020,"Guy Richie has made a lot of very average movies in the last 10 -15 years, so my expectations weren't high. What a wonderful surprise to find a well constructed film with a good plot, great characters, sharp dialogue and great acting. Hugh Grant, amazingly steals the show, but has great support from Colin Farrell, Matthew Mcconaughey and Charlie Hunnam. If you loved Lock Stock and Snatch, you'll love this.",The Gentlemen

If that's not bad enough, the Americans who are trying to use an English accent are just laughable.",The Gentlemen
85,aciessi,Smoking Barrels,7,26 January 2020,"I'm not exactly sure why this film is called The Gentlemen. Maybe ""Bush"" was too raunchy for the MPAA? Or people would have associated it with a former president? Either way, that was the title of the screenplay of which this meta movie is based upon. This is Guy Richie's return to form in the genre of British gangster movies. This time, however, he places himself and the genre he mastered under a parody. This is a self-aware comedy about British gangster movie cliches. A deconstructed version of Snatch, if you will. I thought I'd grow very tired of the constant winking to the audience. Yet, this film doesn't just derive its humor through self-deprecation. It's one of the few comedies out there that feels truly free and alive. The dialogue flows so quick and gracefully, in that classic English way. It's just really funny throughout. I can also give the movie major props for doing three minor, but critical things that just pull everything together. One, this film might just have the only Hugh Grant performance that I didn't hate. Out with the bashful, handsome dope, in with a foul-mouthed, pitch perfect impersonation of Michael Caine. Two, this film might hold the record for the most times the C-Word was used in dialogue, and yet, so classily that you could barely notice it. Three, this film rehabilitates the Miramax brand. Miramax was founded, and permanently tainted by Harvey Weinstein. To see it return here, under new management, is a fascinating conversation all it's own.",The Gentlemen
86,rockman182,The Gentlemen (2020),7,25 January 2020,"I think people were relatively shocked when Guy Ritchie directed the live action Aladdin last year, as it didn't seem like something that he would do. I liked that film but am selective about Ritchie's filmography. The Gentlemen boasts an incredible cast of suave gentlemen who know to smoke and drink in style. Its a loud and abrasive effort which is at times hard to follow but fans of Ritchie's British gangster films will eat this one up for sure.
The film is about a man with a cannabis empire and the people around him that want to attain it. The men get into odds with one another and things get violent. A lot of the film is told in an unorthodox way (mostly through a conversation between Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant). The film stars a multitude of stars who include Grant, Hunnam, Matthew McConaughey, Jeremy Strong, Henry Golding, Michelle Dockery, and Colin Farrell.
The performances are what make the film for me. Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell particularly are absolutely brilliant and memorable characters. The dark and often times offensive humor works very well for the most part. There's many words thrown out there and racial insults so be ready for that. My main issue with the film was the manner in which the plot was told. For me, no matter how much I attempted to follow it was easy to get lost in thee intricacies of what went on in the story.
I think on a re-watch I would be able to appreciate this film more once I try to work out all of what goes on. I think if you liked Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels then you will find enjoyment out of The Gentlemen as it is in the same neighborhood. I appreciated the style and suaveness of the actors involved in the film but struggled to feel the impact that I hoped it would offer.

87,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"A Guy Ritchie film that tries, and fails, to reignite the magic from his first movies.",5,22 February 2020,"I've enjoyed a good portion of Guy Ritchie's filmmaking. While many of his more recent movies rely on franchise appeal (Sherlock Holmes (2009), The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) and Aladdin (2019) are of note), I usually associate his style of filmmaking with the British heist film (like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000)). Consequently, I was looking forward to seeing his recent film, The Gentlemen (2020), as it seemed to be a return to the kind of filmmaking that attracted me to Guy Ritchie films in the first place.Unfortunately, it seems Ritchie has been away from his core movies for so long that he's almost forgotten how to make them. The meta framing with Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam was clunky enough that even Hunnam's character was getting bored with the ""telling"" in the exposition provided by Grant's character. Sure, there were a few neat twists here and there, but it was trying so hard to be a meta-movie like Seven Psychopaths (2012) or The Player (1992) that it lost its focus. In the end, it spent too much time trying to interweave the narrator's narrative and the story narrative, and all it ended up with was a jumbled mess of a movie.I didn't feel like the action or cinematography (two elements that defined Ritchie films in the past) was lacking. This was mostly because so much of this movie is told to us via Hugh Grant. Perhaps this was also because the meaningful action didn't even end up being real, but rather the imagined ""movie version"" of events that played so counter to the characters and how they would act as to break the suspension of disbelief. I'd forgive doing this once, but it seemed to happen on more than one occasion, resulting in an annoying ""just kidding"" wink from the narrator far too often. At the very least, The Gentlemen does show the difference between boys trying to be tough and men who are actually tough.A Guy Ritchie film that tries, and fails, to reignite the magic from his first movies, I give The Gentlemen 2.5 stars out of 5.",The Gentlemen
88,RforFilm,"The Gentlemen is a jolly, violent, and funny with the crime families of England and Matthew McConaughey",8,31 January 2020,"For a guy that loves movies, I do have my favorite and least favorite genres. One of those least favorite genres are mob movies. It has nothing to do with the explicit content or their morals. I just don't find them as engaging as a shoot-em-up western, hilarious comedy, or a fantastical science fiction. A lot of it has to do with the overall dialogue and plot structure. They play out like soap operas where family members and friends will get on board, but then betray those around them, usually whenever it's very convenient for the story to progress forward.That's not to say I dislike mafia stories in general. I'll even admit that The Godfather, Scarface, The Departed, Casino, Goodfellas, and the recent The Irishman are all incredible works of art. I think it has to do with how people try to imitate mobs, only to come off boring. The key to making them work, especially for me, is the really make the characters engaging and worth caring for. In something like The Godfather, you consistently feel sorry for Al Pacino who got dragged into the family business. So let's see what The Gentlemen has to offer.In England, an American crime boss Mickey Pearson (played by Matthew McConaughey) runs a successful drug business that he's in the process of trying to sell for $400 million dollars. All he wants is to retire with his wife Rosalind (played by Michelle Dockery). But along with overall process of hiding it, an underboss for the Chinese mafia, Dry Eye (played by Henry Golding) offers to purchase the drug business, but is rejected. At the same time, one of the hidden drug labs is vandalized and raided by amateur boxers who film their encounter and post it on social media as a part of a rap video.This angers the boxer's coach...named Coach (played by Colin Farrell) who offers his services to Mickey's underboss Raymond. This leads Coach into capturing members of the Chinese mafia to try and intimidate them into leaving them alone. Of course, this only entices them to get more violent with their methods. On top of all this, Big Dave (played by Eddie Marsan), who's the editor of the Daily Print tabloid, hires a private investigator Fletcher (played by Hugh Grant) to dig into this criminal underworld. It just so happens that Fletcher also wants to try and make some blackmail money.The Gentlemen certainly has a lot of characters and plots to get through. I didn't even list smaller parts. That's why I'm glad to say that I was very entertained by The Gentlemen. Director Guy Richie (Sherlock Holmes, Aladdin) tends to use a lot of plot within his stories and can be hit or miss. He seems to love making these mob movies as they can take advantage of that. Where The Gentlemen succeeds is it's characters as I found them to be interesting and balances things by showing off lower and higher class gangsters. It may not be the first, but something about it here feels distinct.This is another movie where the casting is perfect. I can't call them deep characters, but each actor, whether it's Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant, or Henry Golding, they all do a good job bringing a balance of intimidating and funny. I would count the film as a comedy (I'm not even going to spoil what happens to Hugh Grant's character), as a lot of the humor relies on whose trying to rip off who or who their trying to impress.Having said that, the movie can get a little too caught up in it's plots. While most I could follow, there were a lot that were either formulaic or just didn't go anywhere. An editing process probably would have helped make it tighter and focused. Plus you should know the movie does not follow a straightforward story. Because of this, you really need to pay attention to what's going on. This may turn off some people who just want to sit back and have fun. There's a lot of fun here too, though it'll help to keep tabs on whose who and what their doing.I'll give this eight tweed blazers out of ten. I'd say it'll have a good life on video and on the streaming platforms. If this sounds good, then I expect you'll enjoy this. It's teatime and The Gentlemen brings the mafia with it.",The Gentlemen

90,eminkl,God damn if Guy Ritchie isn't still better than anyone else on the planet at making exactly this movie,7,22 April 2020,This movie has had me anticipating because he made King Arthur and that's is a bad movie and I was hoping he would have made a good movie and he has made a good movie. I like how they tell the story for the main storyline is flashbacks and they weave the real-time and flashbacks well. I love Matthew McConaughey in every movie and especially this one when he is the boss of a company and when he is slow-talking and his performance is very good in this movie. This movie has such a stacked cast and I loved all of the performances. Some of the action scenes are very good and it feels so smooth. The score is surprisingly good and I really liked it. I really liked the script but it is inconsistent and the script is just such so fun. There are some cliche moments in this movie and it is kinda disappointing. The movie is predictable especially in the later second act and in the third act and I really wish it wasn't predictable. They do flesh out their characters but I wish they fleshed them out some more if they did I would move my rating up more but they didn't.,The Gentlemen
91,rzajac,Searing heat... and ABSOLUTELY NO LIGHT,2,26 August 2021,"I can cut to the chase: In this film, Richie jerks off at the expense of ticket-buyers.Choosing to make a film with crime as its theme--a ""crime movie""--imposes a requirement: You have to make me care about the outcomes of stories involving criminals.Richie's shorthand approach was the facile imposition of McConaughey's character as a de facto ""good guy"" anchor. The way, way, way overwrought brocade of morally ""lesser"" crime practitioners orbiting that calm center... Richie expects us to mistake all that heat as the shedding of light on the nature of criminal enterprise.And I don't buy it. For one thing it was complex all out of proportion to the ostensible goal of crime stories to shed that light. The idea that such complexity will make us smarter on this is bogus. Like I say in my title, this generates lots and lots of heat. But absent the *light*, that heat is useless, and in fact a little insulting: Richie thinks I'm not going to notice.",The Gentlemen

Writer-director Guy Ritchie returns to his roots by giving us another London-set gangster epic, after Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels(1998) & Snatch(2000). The action & chase set pieces are phenomenal. Ritchie uses his signature style of mixing hilarious & quotable dialogues, along with bone-crushing action sequences. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Matthew McConaughey is spectacular as Mickey Pearson. Charlie Hunnam is outstanding as Ray. Michelle Dockery is amazing as Rosalind Pearson.

93,bankofmarquis,Inventive and Clever,8,27 June 2020,"Ever since he burst onto the film scene with back-to-back interesting British Mob movies LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS and SNATCH, Director Guy Ritchie has had a ""hit and miss"" track record (including the Madonna-starring, Razzie-Award ""winner"" SWEPT AWAY). Fortunately, for us, we seem to be in a Guy Ritchie ""peak"" a this moment.Following up to his surprise strong Directing turn in the live action ALADDIN remake (if you haven't seen this film, the BankofMarquis strongly recommends you do), Ritchie returns to his ""British Gangster"" roots with the violent, funny and original THE GENTLEMEN.Starring Matthew McConaughey as a U.S. born and bred, Cambridge educated hustler who becomes king of the British Marijuana scene who is looking to get out of the business, THE GENTLEMEN tells the tale of the...ahem...gentlemen that are pursuing (both legitimately and illegitimately) his empire.The way that this film is constructed, the most essential casting of this film is that of the central character of Michael Pearson. He is billed as an enigmatic, charismatic, violent and brilliant legend of the British drug trade, so Ritchie needed someone with all these qualities to inhabit that role. Fortunately, with McConaughey, Ritchie finds his man (I'm sure the backstory of this character needed to be tweaked a bit upon this casting to explain why an American is the king of British Weed). McConaughey is at his laconic best in this role, bringing star quality - and star power - that holds the center of this film together well.He is joined by a strong cast that understands the type of film they are in and are game to join in on the (violent) fun. Michelle Dockery (DOWNTON ABBEY), Henry Golding (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) , Jeremy Strong (THE BIG SHORT) and the always watchable Eddie Marsan (THE WORLD'S END, amongst others) all are strong in the limited moments that their characters are allowed to shine, but with McConaughey and 3 other actors I will speak to in a moment, they are relegated mostly to the background.This is because Hugh Grant (4 WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL), Colin Farrell (PHONE BOOTH) and (surpisingly) Charlie Hunnam IPACIFIC RIM) almost steal the film from McConaughey, Each one of these characters could have easily been the centerpiece of their own film and I would be happy if Ritchie would spin one of these characters off.Credit, of course, for all of this has to go to Ritchie who wrote and directed this film I was pleasantly surprised by the cleverness and inventiveness in storytelling and style as well as the restraint that Ritchie shows in the violence. He uses it (somewhat) sparingly and well, so the violence punctuates the action.All-in-all a fun (though violent) time at the movies.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Gentlemen

It's the dad rock of 2020 movies.
I'm not sure why this is supposed to be entertainment, although I acknowledge it is made with technical flair much of the script and story doesn't stand thinking about, why would Hugh Grant's character ever imagine it's a good idea to black mail such brutal and humorless criminals so close and without an army to back him up, what was he really blackmailing them over and would he ever walk out alive, of course not. it's stupid.

But it's damn boring with an unreliable narrator dictating to the audience the entire plot. It tries to be meta but bores like no other.Such a shame because this film had an A+ cast. Matthew McConaughey, Henry Golding, Colin Farrel, Jeremy Strong, Jason Wong, Hugh Grant, etc, etc, etc. The plot contains drug kingpins, Triad gangsters, blackmail, and a power struggle. With such an interesting plot and cast, you'd expect this to be the action movie of the year. But it falls flat on delivery.And the style of the movie feels unfocused at best.

It has different layers of old skool machismo laced with a good deal of irony. It's fun stuff with the expected smattering of violence and Hugh Grant is a joy in a very different role.,The Gentlemen
97,kjproulx,Guy Richie at His Best,8,2 April 2020,"Guy Richie has been a director that hasn't always blown me away in the past. I've been amused by his outings with Sherlock Holmes and quite enjoyed The Man from U.N.C.L.E., but I wasn't even all that impressed by his fan favourites, like Snatch. For myself, I see that's he's now on a nice little streak. I really enjoyed his live-action remake of Aladdin and I think The Gentlemen may be my favourite film he has ever done. Although it does get a little self-indulgent at times, here's why I believe The Gentlemen may impress you, even though you may need to have an acquired taste for it.The Gentlemen tells the story of Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a man who wishes to sell off his Marijuana empire in order to escape from the crimes he has committed. This leads to a lot of blackmailing and mistakes, which then leads to death and chaos. However, at its core, this film is about Fletcher (Hugh Grant), a man who is trying to make this story into a feature film. This element was probably my favourite portion, as it tied current events into past events, which made for an interesting experience. Sadly, that formula became a little self-indulgent by the final act.As I mentioned, Guy Richie, who directed this film, has a very unique style. To get the negative out of the way first, without ruining anything for viewers, there is a scene towards the end of the movie that breaks the fourth wall in ways I haven't seen in a while. That particular scene left a bad taste in my mouth, but I enjoyed the rest of the movie too much to let that be a huge detractor. From his witty/snappy dialogue to his hilarious choices of the way certain characters speak, he has certainly not lost touch with the types of movies he likes to make. For myself, this one just happened to work for me, more than any of his previous original work.From Matthew McConaughey to Charlie Hunnam (who is fantastic in this role), Colin Ferrell to Henry Golding, and the rest of the endless talent, The Gentlemen is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to the talent on-screen. I was actually worried throughout the first 20 to 30 minutes that it felt a little messy and that these actors wouldn't have many ways to shine, but I was wrong. This movie finds its footing by the end of the first act and never lets up. I was thoroughly impressed by the acting, screenplay, and overall editing throughout the film, that my complaints never ruined my enjoyment.In the end, The Gentlemen isn't a perfect movie and Guy Richie definitely pats himself on the back a little too often this time, but I would be lying if I didn't say I had an absolute blast. The dialogue came a mile-a-minute and it was either important to the story, clever for the sake of being clever, or simply hilarious, and I just ate that aspect up. The quick style of this movie won't be for everyone, but if you happen to enjoy that sort of thing, then you may just love this movie.

98,AhmedSpielberg99,Enjoyable!,6,27 May 2020,"Less than the sum of its parts; cool action scenes, decent performances, interesting characterisations and bits of witty dialogue here and there, but the structure is deeply flawed and messy, and the plot is too convoluted for its own good -- I guess Ritchie thought his film is way smarter than it really is.What really bogged this movie down for me though is Ritchie's persistence to veer away from his early style which he presumably, to some degree, returned to here. I get that he wanted to return to form without making yet another version of Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (both of which I liked, especially the former), but I'm quite not sure whether most of the choices he made here in order to render the film a refreshing feel worked together. Regardless, The Gentlemen is a good fun with enough clever touches to satisfy Ritchie's fans.(6.5/10)",The Gentlemen
99,kuarinofu,Ritchie's things,8,9 April 2020,"The first 30 minutes or so I was just laughing because of how silly everything looked and how childish everyone was. But after some time the movie sort of drag me in, I started to enjoy the silliness of it just cause I remembered how good Ritchie was with his smug and saucy crime comedies.I mean, the script still feels like it was written by an edgy 15-year-old but it's just so entertaining and fun. Lots of funny lines and exchanges, which get only better when you think about how the actors felt on set trying to deliver those, Farrell is amazing in this, he looks so adorable in his 40ties dressed as a 20 y.o.I'm 100% sure that no one could've made this script work but Ritchie. He does this good balance of childish nonsense and engaging story (with predictable twists, but still). All the main characters were likable enough to care for them, and even though they were not deep enough they still feel like they have some personality to them and that's great.Some of the stuff in the film was weird, like the message that heroin is bad and it kills people but weed is fine or something and some gay undertones, but most of the time it's just pure brainless entertainment.Never change, Guy Ritchie, never change.",The Gentlemen
100,springfieldrental,Must Be A Ritchie Fan To Enjoy This Romp,6,3 March 2020,"OK, first off I'm not a big Guy Ritchie fan. His films involve largely convoluted plots that unnecessarily meander off in complex avenues to showcase the simple message that life is not all that it appears to be.Case in point is The Gentleman. Using Hugh Grant to be the glue that supposedly ties the narrative threads together, Ritchie instead dashes an element of deviousness as he manipulates Grant into the scheme of backstabbing among business friends. We've seen these drug dealing movies all too frequently, when honor among thieves is thrown out the window. And Ritchie makes the illicit underground drug industry much more dark with numerous murders that have little consequences to the participants--other than getting shot themselves.All in all, a forgettable film that is ok in its initial viewing, but unsustainable in the memory once a week passes.",The Gentlemen

My Rating 8.5 /10The trailers for The Gentlemen doesn't give a lot away and either will my Review except to say if you enjoyed the classic black comedy In Bruges (2008) with Colin Farrell,who is one of ""The Gentlemen "" or Guy Ritchie's ""The Snatch ""2000 you should really enjoy this film.If really full on swearing especially the 'C"" word offends you ( it doesn't bother me at all if it fits the characters but it may not be your cup of tea.
There is violence more implied and not graphic and the plots fast paced and convoluted but it's so clever and original and very very funny in parts .I'm really looking forward to seeing it again to catch up on a few plot lines that passed me by.
The performances are all top class especially Hugh Grant who I've never considered a really great actor but I've change my mind after today.
In fact his performances in the last few films he's been in like A Very English Scandal and Paddington 2 up until The Gentlemen I would say have been his best acting roles.
He is cast in The Gentlemen as Fletcher a Private Investigator trying to fleece $20 million from a British gangster hit man cartel . Hugh Grant's performance in my opinion is the funniest detective role to come along since Peter Sellers Chief Inspector Clouseau . He's brilliant as the very camp cunningly conniving Fletcher and his East end drawl is incredibly clever acting .Often fine performances are due to a good director and Guy Ritchie who directed and wrote the screenplay for The Gentlemen has excelled in this film .
I enjoyed this more than the recent ""Knives Out "" film which was very good but The Gentlemen I think is in a Class similar to the late Blake Edwards at his best.The other stand out performances are from Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Pearson an American expat who became rich by building a marijuana empire in London .
A Simplified version of the plot is that when word gets out that Mickey is looking to cash out his business,it soon triggers an array of plots and schemes from those who want his fortune.Michelle Dockery completely buries any vision of herself as Lady Mary from Downton Abbey in the Gentlemen in her role as Mickey's wife and business partner with a hot gangster moll outfit and figure to match and some red hot lines to match,she's sensational in this role .In fact all the performances are good we see Henry Golding step out of his nice Asian dude character from Crazy Rich Asians and an angel in Last Christmas to play Dry Eye a young gangster protege trying to take over the territory from his Uncle Wang Young. Harlie Hunam as Raymond and Colin Farrell as Coach also give stand out performances
I was really surprised and delighted by how much I enjoyed The Gentlemen and look forward to seeing it again.",The Gentlemen

The plot follows a poor American boy who wins a prestigious UK scholarship and quickly builds a marijuana empire. Flash forwards to present day, we see he now wants to sell up and retire.The movie is structured around a very camp Grant who is a corrupt newspaper reporter, who has a mountain of dodgy evidence and a related printed movie script. Grant narrates the plot throughout by way of a lengthy conversation with Hannan.The very tangled plot involves lots of double crossing, bribery and blackmail in an attempt to drive down the price of the marijuana empire.

104,msbreviews,The Gentlemen might be Guy Ritchie's best film to date!,8,27 February 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I've always been a fan of Guy Ritchie's style. While I do admit that he tends to overuse his own techniques (like he does in this movie), he always manages to bring something unique to his projects. He delivered a pretty good live-action remake of Aladdin while offering his own take (Jasmine has more compelling motivations). I surprisingly enjoyed King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword, but the ending is disappointing. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the Sherlock Holmes films are entertaining and fun, to say the least. So, yes, I was sort of excited to watch The Gentlemen.With such a stellar cast, how can someone not be interested in an old-fashioned crime-thriller? First of all, I want to get this out right away: it's a movie that anyone can enjoy, sure, but for people who know how films usually work, Ritchie applies a storytelling method that's going to make every ""filmmaking nerd"" lose their minds. Hugh Grant (Fletcher) is mostly the narrator of the entire story, and he's basically interpreting a ""version"" of Guy Ritchie telling the story of his own ""flick"".This means Fletcher goes on and on about film specs like aspect ratios and film gauges but also helping the audience understand what's happening, by announcing if the story is near its climax or if ""the plot thickens"". It's a captivating and funny way of using exposition without it being lazy or forced. Grant also makes sure to ask the questions the audience should be asking. This way, even people who don't like to think when they go to the cinema (yes, they exist) will be able to follow the mystery unraveling.Obviously, the unbelievable cast makes this movie so much fun. Matthew McConaughey is a masterful actor when it comes to carrying long dialogues. Everything he says is always engaging, either by the way he says it, his expressions, or the physical intensity he puts into his own words. Charlie Hunnam (Ray) probably delivers his most amusing performance to date. Ray is definitely going to be a fan-favorite character, and his interactions with Fletcher (with who he spends most of the runtime) are hilarious.Henry Golding (Dry Eye), Michelle Dockery (Rosalind Pearson), and Jeremy Strong (Matthew) all give excellent performances, but Colin Farrell is the best of this group of characters as Coach. His scenes are some of the funniest sequences of the entire year so far. From his accent to the action he eventually gets into, he's one of those characters who will leave everyone wanting more. As for the story, it's undoubtedly one of the most complex screenplays I've seen in a while. Comparing with Knives Out, the narrative structure ends up being a bit similar.Both possess tons of twists and turns that will make everyone scratch their heads for quite some time. Both show different events of the story, featuring a specific character at a particular time in a distinct manner (flashback, flashforward, simple exposition). However, The Gentlemen abuses from its own trick a bit too much, especially during the first half. Something entertaining can quickly turn into something pretty annoying if the storytelling isn't well-balanced. Can't have too much of anything, right?This is my overall issue with the film. Guy Ritchie brings something cool and fresh to escape heavy exposition, but it's still a lot of information to transmit, and it doesn't always work smoothly. Some subplots didn't need to go so deep, which takes time away from more emotionally investing storylines. Nevertheless, in the end, Ritchie stitches every story together seamlessly to create a very well-written flick. With so many intricate layers, it's extremely difficult to bring it all together to make a cohesive finale, but Ritchie does it superbly.All in all, The Gentlemen is another hit for Guy Ritchie, and it might even be his best movie yet. With one of the most complex screenplays in a while, the phenomenal cast elevates this crime-thriller into one of the best films of 2020, so far. Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, and Colin Farrell stand out, but every actor delivers excellent performances. Extremely funny and captivating storytelling through Grant's narration, which ironic or not, it's both the best and worst component of the movie. When used in excess, it can be a bit bothersome and lengthy, but for most of the runtime, this alternative to substantial exposition works brilliantly. Interesting characters, intriguing mystery, and hilarious bits of comedy make this feature very entertaining. Technically, great editing keeps a well-paced flow, but it's Ritchie's layered narrative that steals the show.Rating: B+",The Gentlemen

110,MrDHWong,An entertaining return to that classic Guy Ritchie style of British gangster eccentricism,8,16 April 2020,"The Gentlemen is a crime comedy film written and directed by Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Aladdin). Starring Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Colin Farrell, and Hugh Grant, it is an entertaining return to that classic Guy Ritchie style of British gangster eccentricism that has been missing for quite some time.In London, Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a charismatic American drug kingpin who specialises in cannabis, attempts to sell off his business for $400,000,000 so he can retire in peace. After first offering the position to billionaire Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong), Mickey attracts the attention of Chinese gangster Dry Eye (Henry Golding), who tries to buy out the business for a considerably lower asking price, much to Mickey's displeasure. As a result of this, word gets out among the world's crime syndicates as various other high ranking racketeers pursue ways to steal Mickey's empire out from under him.Much like ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"" before it, ""The Gentlemen"" wears its distinct British flavour on its sleeve as we are treated to an erratic and sometimes darkly funny look into the London criminal underworld. The unapologetic approach it takes to depicting violence, drug use, and political incorrectness will prove highly off-putting to any newcomers to the director's work but anyone longing for a return to the style of the aforementioned films will be greatly satisfied. It certainly feels refreshing to watch a movie that isn't afraid to push the boundaries of what would be considered appropriate for a modern gangster film, especially without seeming like it is trying too hard.After experiencing something of a creativity drought in recent years, Guy Ritchie comes back with a vengeance, bringing his trademark fast paced editing and unmistakable British charm to a film much more suited to his personal preferences. Anyone who has seen his early work will remember that he will often punctuate a violent scene with tongue-in-cheek comic relief to help ease the audience through the severity of what they have just witnessed. There were a number of times where I laughed out loud at some of these moments, sometimes out of shock and sometimes out of the genuine comedic value on display. In addition, Ritchie's storytelling technique also remains the same, in that you really need to pay attention to every intricate detail of a character's actions to fully understand the entire plot. There are the odd blink-and-you-miss-it moments where I failed to understand something and needed to look it up later on but they didn't feel as punishing to the viewer as in some of the director's previous films. Once you get used to this style, Ritchie's films take on a unique life of their own and begin to feel as though they exist within their own custom-made universe.Being an ensemble cast, each of the main actors shine in their own unique ways. Matthew McConaughey of course stands out as the main American in a predominantly British gangster world, exuding an unflappable confidence as he does business in a foreign land. Charlie Hunnam brings an intimidating stance to his role as McConaughey's right-hand man, often striking fear in other characters merely due to his presence in the room. Colin Farrell, while not receiving as much screen time as the rest of his co-stars, is his usual Irishman self with a penchant for saying the odd witty quip at the end of a scene. However, the role that surprised me the most was an almost unrecognisable Hugh Grant as a heavily-accented private detective. It actually took me a moment to realise it was even him near the beginning of the film but once I did I was treated to one of his best performances to date. I only wish he'd played roles like this much earlier in his career, as opposed to being typecast as the mild mannered Englishmen in romantic comedies but I suppose it's better late than never I guess.As it stands, ""The Gentlemen"" may not leave as much of an impression on audiences as Guy Ritchie's earlier films but it still makes for a worthy addition to his filmography. There is definitely much to enjoy in seeing a filmmaker creating something for audiences who appreciate the craft of his work in spite of the failures and near-misses throughout his career. If anything, it proves that even after more than twenty years in the film business, he still has plenty more surprises for us to look forward to.I rate it 8/10",The Gentlemen

It's fun, it's groteseque at Points and it has nice Twists. Still it doesnt have the touch films like ""Snatch"" or ""Lock, Stock..."" or their Cleverness but it is at least getting close to that.
The actors obviously had a lot of fun and that reflects in their Performances. First we have Matthew McConaughey, who is simply perfect for the role of an american marijuna farmer who tries to sell his Business and gets involvoed into a lot of Trouble with it. McConaughy's coolness and sneakiness totally fits that role. A great turn also by Charlie Hunman who really has a fantastic character on Hand with many different facettes and that is hard to figure out at the beginning. The greatest Performance however came from Hugh Grant, who is actually Award worthy and wonderfully Plays against his typical stereotype. He is the true Scene stealer of the Ensemble. Last but certainly not least we have Colin Farrell who absolutely fits a Guy Rithchie movie or character. Michelle Dockery also has her Moments but sadly was a Little bit underused.

So many standout moments, funny scenes and quotable lines.

This is the type of movie Guy Ritchie does best and I for one am in favor of him continuing to make these kinds of movies. His Tarantino-esque dialogue is delivered perfectly by a very talented cast. Hugh Grant is probably the most entertaining I've ever seen him and Colin Farrell is wickedly funny. The movie is filmed with such flair that you get sucked into this goofy world and it doesn't let you go until the credits hit. I had an absolute blast watching this film and it is one that rewards you for paying close attention.,The Gentlemen
116,CANpatbuck3664,"At its High Points The Gentlemen is Fantastic, At its Low Points its Still A lot of Fun",8,31 January 2020,"I've always been a defender of Guy Ritchie. He's made a couple of sub-par films (I think we should all just erase King Arthur out of our collective memory) but when he's on his game, very few can touch him. He might not have been the pioneer of British gangster films but he's the notable name for it. The Gentlemen is him flexing his creative muscles, instead of just carbon copying Snatch or Lock & Stock, he made some interesting creative choices in this. The Gentlemen had his style but it was updated and modern, and it had the same flair yet brought something fresh to the table. Does it get a little pretentious and precious? Yes, it absolutely does. The dialogue and the style is largely gold but I think Guy could have used someone looking over his shoulder and telling him to tighten it up a little. Some of the 5 minute speeches may have been more effective at 3:30 instead but in a movie so filled with memorable one-liners or fun scenes, this is a minor point of contention. I was genuinely impressed that he went the extra mile to present us with something unique.While McConaughey is the first featured in the credits, the ensemble here is surprisingly big and full of famous players. It took me a little while to get used to McConaughey in this role, with The Gentlemen being so overtly British, he's just doing McConaughey in the middle of it. But as the movie went on, you realize how fantastic of an actor he is and his casting seems more natural. Hugh Grant probably has the next most screen time, he's playing against type and while he's hamming it up a little, it was fun watching him do something so different. Charlie Hunnam is surprisingly effective, I've always liked him, he just hasn't had much luck picking movie projects. He's got a lot of screen presence though and this was a reminder that when he's well cast, he's a capable leading actor. My favourite performance was Colin Farrell as Coach, Farrell is a lot of fun and has good comedic chops when he's not being pretty boy Colin Farrell (he's also fantastic in the underrated Horrible Bosses). He had me cracking up whenever he was on screen. Henry Golding continues to rise as Dry Eye, this was a new direction for him and he has more range than just being a romantic comedy lead. I would also note Michelle Dockery as Mickey's beautiful wife Rosalind. She's a well written and fairly realistic character and Michelle does a great job portraying her.While I talked about the updated style, I also want to credit writer/director Guy Ritchie for turning out the great dialogue he usually does. The script here could have just been recycled but the plot has a couple of twists you don't expect (within reason, its tough with this kind of film, you are only introduced to so many characters) and the dialogue is chock full of interesting one-liners and memorable exchanges. There were several points where I was cackling, a lot of them came from Coach. Its very non PC but it fits the culture of the people in the movie.I didn't love The Gentlemen right of the bat but by the time I hit the halfway point, I was absolutely in. It also helped that the ending was handled well. There were a few surprises, some tense moments and some chuckles to be had. I'm glad I got to see it in theatres and I absolutely recommend you do the same. My rating is actually between an 8-9 but I must round down in this case. I hope more people end up going to see it and I applaud Ritchie and his team for returning to form in this release",The Gentlemen

120,ronakkotian,Back to doing what Guy Ritchie does best,7,10 September 2021,"It's been a very long time since I've enjoyed a Guy Ritchie movie. He hasn't been able to capture the magic of Snatch ever since that film but thankfully, Ritchie went back to the drawing board and gave us The Gentlemen.The Gentlemen centers around Mickey Pearson, an American born marijuana kingpin, who's trying to sell off his business in London leading to a chain of events involving blackmail and schemes.Guy Ritchie's recent films like Aladdin have been disappointing me so it was very satisfying to see him back in his element with The Gentlemen. It felt really to see him go back to doing what he does best and I had a lot of fun with this film. This is Guy Ritchie at his most Guy Ritchie. The script is as snappy as you would expect from him with dialogues that flow very beautifully. They come at you fast and include some great moments that are hilarious. One of the things I enjoyed was the meta aspect to the film. There's a whole element where Hugh Grant is writing a script on the events that take place and the references to the filmmaking was fun to watch. Like Snatch, this film paces at breakneck speed. The film moves so quick that I feel like it needed to slow down at times to give some breathing space for the audience. The story has many twists and turns and the fast pacing can make it difficult to keep up with everything.The cast that Ritchie assembled for this film is amazing. Matthew McConaughey is excellent here as Mickey Pearson. Jeremy Strong, Eddie Marsan and Henry Golding all do a great job as well. Michelle Dockery is great but I wish more was done with her character. The standouts in my opinion were Hugh Grant, Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrell. Hugh Grant was very entertaining to watch and the witty dialogue he was given added so much to the fun of his character. This is the best I've seen Charlie Hunnam in a film. I loved his calm demeanour but he was also someone you wouldn't want to mess with. Colin Farrell was absolutely hilarious and gave another strong performance. I was also surprised to see Bugzy Malone here but I thought he did well. There's one amazing sequence with him and Farrell that had me laughing out loud.Whilst The Gentlemen doesn't reach the levels of Snatch, it's still an entertaining watch and a return to form for Guy Ritchie.

Matthew McConaughey may be the glamour boy, but Hugh Grant steals the show as a mercenary journalist trying to hawk secrets to both sides. Grant's career is on an upswing since he impersonated Jeremy Thorpe (also playing for two teams!). His posh accent totally disappears into 'Estuary English', as does Michelle Dockery's as Mickey's tough-cookie wife: I nearly fainted when Downton's Lady Mary used the C-word.Everyone uses the C-word.

Heck, Christopher Nolan, the current champion of ""smart"" action thrillers, rehashed his complete filmography and made Tenet which, in turn, was supposed to save the cinema in the post-Covid world.Anyhow, The Gentlemen is fun and accessible. Matthew McConaughey even toned down his southern drawl for the occasion. And if you're looking for something to complain about, it would be the performance of Jeremy Strong.

not as funny as the other Guy Ritchie films. Found there was little to no humour in thissame idea, but for action scenes as well. Expected a little more gore/fighting scenes etcending was a bit underwhelming. I felt like it all ended then they added 10 minutes on, which I just didn't see the point in it.On the whole though it didn't take anything away from it being an enjoyable watch. It's not as good as his classic films don't get me wrong. I don't think anything will be really. Films like Snatch etc are so good it just can't be beaten. But overall I enjoyed this. Interesting story, good acting and just well done in general. I recommend.",The Gentlemen

First, the casting is superb, Matthew, Charlie, Hugh and even Colin are simply amazing on their roles. Maybe adding Statham and Vinnie Jones could have been a dream. Second, the script is as good as Lock&Stock or Snatch my two favorites masterpieces from Ritchie. Last but not least, even the ending was not the best, I would like a second statement going deeply into the characters. There is so much to explore on this new universe.

132,ethanbresnett,Guy Ritchie doing what he does best,8,14 November 2020,"There's lots of good stuff about The Gentlemen. The story is fun, engaging and clever. There are a few telegraphed twists and turns, but quite a few blindsided me. Its a good twisty turny plot, and the non-linear storytelling and the way it is told through narration is very clever in adding to this intrigue and mystery. Ritchie's direction is excellent, telling the story in a pretty inventive way in parts with good pacing.Like any Guy Ritchie gangster film, we are treated to an eclectic character list, some of whom are more developed than others. This is one of my criticisms of the film. Far too many of the characters were one dimensional, when they could have been great! Ritchie had the skeleton of some great characters, but failed to flesh enough of them out for my liking.I think McConaughey was a standout, both in terms of character and performance. The jury is still out on Hugh Grant, I haven't decided if it was a cringey or brilliant performance... Other than these two, I found the other characters uninspiring and cliched, the sorts of characters I've seen in plenty of other gangster films. It didn't help that the accents kept coming and going, and this inconsistency was pretty much across the board.I also thought that the dialogue was as rough as anything at times. It was like somebody was parodying a Guy Ritchie film, which is hard as his films already feel like a parody to start off with. I got past this as the film went on and I got more immersed, but at the start it was quite jarring.If you like gangster films and Guy Ritchie, I see no reason why you wouldn't really enjoy this.",The Gentlemen
133,MovieCriticOnline,This made me realize why I don't like Richie Movies,1,22 July 2020,"So I decided to watch this knowing absolutely nothing about it. During the opening scene my very first thought less than one minute into it was ""oh, oh, this is going to be one of those style over substance films."" (Besides thinking how fake the blood looked)Fancy camera work when it wasn't needed. I don't wanna watch a film and be thinking of the ""Direction"" of the film. I only want to watch the film and think about the story, characters, relationships etc. There is such thing as over directing, which means your focus is on camera work, staging actors etc, rather than having an organic composition of the scene, i.e. letting the actors play out the scene in a natural way or at least it should feel that way.The whole idea of movies is to suspend your disbelief, not to make us aware it is a movie by constantly doing things that takes us out of the experience.On top of that the actors (likely from being directed this way) were so over the top i.e. trying too hard to create memorable characters. The dialogue didn't help. No one speaks like this. They just don't. The clever monologues and tired Hollywood repartee.I am just so tired of seeing these phony overly staged and directed movies.Of course as I saw the credits, all my intuitive feelings were validated because of course it was a Guy Richie film, the king of style over substance director.So cringeworthy.",The Gentlemen
134,akcenat,"Guy Ritchie is back in the territory where he feels most comfortable, the London crime-scene",8,6 April 2020,"""The Gentlemen"" is similar in nature to Guy Ritchie's previous British gangster movies, but it's at the other end of the scale, more up-market. Many of the major characters even dress like hipsters, but they're still delightfully foul-mouthed low-lives thanks to some brilliant performances from a very colorful cast. Hugh Grant has embraces his villainous role to great effect as he is is an absolute delight as the tabloid journalist while McConaughey, Farrell, Hunnam, Dockery are clearly having a blast. This stylish violent funny thriller may not be everyone's cup of tea, but this film is exactly what you think it will be - it's vulgar, violent, erratic, and mostly all over the place - and that's why it succeeds and doesn't disappoint. Ultimately, some fun performances and the occasional stellar scene make this worth the watch. ""The Gentlemen"" is a trip to the theater that you won't regret, just shut you brain off and have some fun.Rating: 7+/8-",The Gentlemen
135,pfgpowell-1,More of the same Guy Ritchie schtick (and none the worse for that_,7,30 April 2021,"Here in Britain we talk of something being 'Marmite' (an odd and salty yeast extract spread): you like it or hate it. Well, I'm not talking about 'loving' or 'hating' Ritchie's films, but let's be frank: he's not going to go down as one of the world's greatest filmmakers, so you are either amused by Guy Ritchie's schtick or you find it increasingly irritating.Me, I tend to like it, even though his various hits (and there have been one or two misses) are pretty much the same film over again. But then they say that 'it's not the joke, but the way you tell it'. And Ritchie has patented an entertaining way of telling what, let's again be frank, are nothing but shaggy dog stories.It would be pointless to outline 'the story' of the film, because 'the story' is totally irrelevant. It's how Ritchie tells 'em which does the biz. And, oh well, I don't doubt my credibility will now go down the pan, but I like how he tells 'em.His cast all turn in very entertaining performances, there are more than enough slick lines and turns of phrase to satisfy and it - as usual - rolls along nicely. The confusion is eventually sorted out. All you have to do is hang in there.As for that cast, special mention should go to Hugh Grant who plays totally against type as a sleazy, gay, murky, East London hack who takes it into his head to try to blackmail Matthew McConaughey's cannabis big shot, and who is not quite as clever as he thinks he is.As usual user reviews say this is 10/10 'brilliant, man' or that it's 1/10 'complete trash'. It's neither: it's unpretentious, entertaining Ritchie fare. And, and as I say, you either go for it or you don't. If you like his schtick, this is very much your bag so watch it. If you don't, well, find something else to do.",The Gentlemen

138,TwistedContent,Guy Ritchie Delivers What I'm Longing For,9,20 February 2020,"Honestly, why do critics dislike this one so much? And if not exactly disliking, then throwing it in the bowl of mediocrities. Me? I'm just happy Guy Ritchie has returned to his original form, the genre of crime comedy - which is also why the aforementioned critics seem to dislike it... Yes, ""The Gentleman"" is not breaking any new grounds, but oh man it is fun to watch.Ritchie puts on the table a new spiritual relative to his movies ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", ""Snatch"", ""Rocknrolla"" & ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."", a crime comedy so slick and lively that it's impossible not to like it. At least let the audience's rating show that. ""The Gentleman"" is a story about Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), an american who built a marijuana empire in the Britain and is now tired of it, he tries to sell it to another american billionaire Matthew (Jeremy Strong), and guess what - all hell breaks loose in the criminal world around them. A whole bunch of awesome characters, crackling dialogue, amusing scenes, a few cool action sequences, the whole runtime tags along nice and smooth. The beginning or the first half is a tad bit slower than the rest of it & for some time I had fears of accurately predicting the end result, but, of course, the second half includes a whole lotta Ritchie shenanigans. Performances are a treat to watch, McConaughey delivers the goods as usual, but highlights also include Charlie Hunnam (whose character and performance might just be my favorite here, it came more as a surprise) and Hugh Grant, whom I could hardly compare to the other roles I've seen him do. Goes without saying that the rest of the cast is on the same level, never an average performance in a Guy Ritchie crime flick. ""The Gentleman"" is also tastefully filmed, no complaints about the aesthetical decisions, and props for the low-key awesome intro sequence. Also, I can always expect to steal a few songs from Guy's crime movies, ""The Gentleman"" did the exact opposite of a disappointment in that matter.Whereas enough people see ""The Gentleman"" as an old-shtick in new clothes, I see the type of stuff I've always expected from Ritchie since my 9th birthday when I saw ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrells"" for the first time. ""The Gentleman"" is fun, playful, contains top tier performances, and is undeniably entertaining. Let the next from Ritchie be just as fun! My rating: 9/10.",The Gentlemen

145,jamiedarlow-37510,'Bobby.... A pint and a pickled egg.',8,9 February 2020,"I was hooked instantly from the distinctive dialogue we have missed from Guy Ritchie for so long and it really is Ritchie's best since Snatch! Mickey runs a hugely successful marijuana empire in England and looks to sell it to the highest bidder. All the while, various outside influencers attempt to steal it from under his nose. That's the plot in a nutshell although there's many more strands that are great to discover on your first watch. I loved particular sequences in this one and really liked it overall! The plot is presented to us initially through Fletcher, a slimy private detective with plenty of dirt on the other characters in the story, with Hugh Grant on incredible form in a role we haven't really seen him do before. His frequent cinematic musings on the story that he has been following for some time is told beautifully through Ritchie's trademark dialogue which is the key highlight here combined with the performances. Mcconaughey provides an unorthodox 'good guy' and has a lot of fun in the role portraying someone genuinely menacing but also with clear morals in his business and a man who deeply loves his wife Rosalind (Michelle Dockery) who is also fantastic here. Colin Farrell is fantastically funny and badass in his role as Coach which also can be said for everyone in this movie; they take on the roles and effortlessly convey coolness! I was most impressed however with Charlie Hunham as Ray, a man with obsessive compulsive disorder yet when he's placed into a difficult situation to retrieve a clients daughter in a place he would prefer to avoid, he completely commands the situation and it makes for compelling viewing. The plot is very hard to follow in the first act and almost feels like you're having to catch up with what's going on straight away, but once you get into the flow with the characters, it's consistently entertaining, deliciously dark and absolutely hilarious, beautifully edited by James Herbert and a must see return to the British crime genre from one of the masters",The Gentlemen
146,fciocca,"Expectations were not disappointed: excellent cast, entertaining and nice screeplay",8,4 June 2020,"I finally watched ""The Gentlemen"", by Guy Ritchie. The movie hooked me since the very beginning, the storytelling is on point, few action scenes are nicely directed and the acting job is perfect. Well, cast is composed by great names such as Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell and Hugh Grant.The strongest point of the entire movie is for sure the storytelling. The Gentlemen will uncover little by little the criminal empire built by Michael, all plots made by rivals to take over his business and there will be many unexpected plot twists. I am happy that still in 2020 there are directors that can genuinely surprise me. Transitions between different events are nicely done and help to create a cohesive and continuous story. Movie never lose his pace: everything has the correct timing, never felt bored once.It is not the best movie of Ritchie, but is very solid and for sure worth a watch.",The Gentlemen
147,DeBBss,Of Coarse the Critics Hate It,7,21 July 2020,"The best part about Guy Ritchie as a film maker is not his directing, but his screenwriting. And in The Gentlemen, he writes one of his smartest films. The screenplay is so clever and there's so many layers to it. The acting is great too; the cast has insane talent. The pacing was very smart and consistent, which really makes The Gentlemen watchable.The plot is very Guy Ritchie, you've got gangsters, drugs, and pigs. Guy Ritchie's films are very similar and they become predictable, so Guy Ritchie adds a death scene at the beginning, to then add a twist. Guy Ritchie's self awareness and brilliance is what made The Gentlemen stand out. The pacing is so consistently good, and I was always hooked to the plot. The story is narrated by a real time conversation through two characters; and this type of story telling is a hit or miss, but it works so well in The Gentlemen. I don't think any other screenwriter can do as good a job as Guy Ritchie in The Gentlemen.The cast is a big selling point in Guy Ritchie movies and it's no different here. Mathew McConaughey did a solid job and so did Charlie Hunnam. Unfortunately, I think the actors are more interesting than the characters. The only character that got a good amount of exposition was Michael Pearson. There wasn't enough information about Charlie Hunnam's character, Ray. The Gentlemen does focus a lot on developing the plot and not so much on the characters, so at least it was done intentionally.The Gentlemen was a solid Guy Ritchie flick, that's entertaining and likable. The screenplay is my favorite part about The Gentlemen, which is then followed by the great casting. The real thing lacking in The Gentlemen are the characters, which were poorly developed in my opinion.",The Gentlemen

director: Guy Ritchie
starring: Mathew Mcconaughey, Hugh Grant, Michelle Dockery,Charlie Hunman,Colin Farrel,Henry Golding,Jeremy Strong etcoverall rating 70/100The gentleman was a lot of fun,with great performances and was visually interesting but for me a missed opportunity lets talk about why this is.first of all i have to talk about the incredible cast and the amount of likeable characters. The cast was very impressive with big names perfect for each of their roles. And most of the characters were incredibly liekable. As none of them gave a damn about anyone else which just made them instantly charecters you could get behind. And there was so many campy over the top performances that just worked well for the film.What i also liked was that all the characters got equal screen time. They managed to find a way where each of the characters got equal time for development and to show of there personalities. So you could form some form of connection to there characters which was fun to watch.However my first negative would be that the films plot wasn't original enough. This sort of thing has been done before, with the whole drug dealer wanting to sell his business and people wanting to stop them is something we have seen before. I couldn't help but feel they could of been more creative and had more of a plot that separates itself from previous films like this but unfortunately it didn't.Next i thought that the films script was very clever and its visuals were great. The film's script was excellent at making you play along with the plot of the movie. As the dynamic of splitting the screen time between past and present with Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunman worked well. But also they did some interesting things with the visuals. Including making the frame look like an old camera from the early 20th century, and the cinematography and set pieces were colourful, interesting and led to some great action sequences and uses of props.Next the film was very funny. All the characters said some hilarious things that you weren't expecting to come out of there mouths. The film definitely went for shock factor with the humour which largely worked as something different. But i do have to say the film overstepped the line with some of its humour. I just thought that they overstepped the line with the constant use of the c word especially involving a scene with black actor Bugzy Malone. The humour involving a pig was just slightly to controversial as well, it all just depends on how much of the crudeness and shock factor you can take.Now my final positive would be the excellent stand out performance from Hugh Grant. Wow what a different role for him, but he made it work and i was left pleasantly surprised. His very campy and humorous performance was a breath of fresh air and fantastic to watch every time he was on screen. And his character was delightfully sneaky making you have a good blend of liking and disliking his character.Now my final two negatives that for me held back the movie from being great and made it more disappointing for me. It had a very over complicated plot and the ending was sadly poorly executed. The film was just narratively weak sadly, they had way to many subplots and randomly thrown in moments that it just didn't work and it becomes to difficult to keep up with even for the most clever of audience members. So despite it being less then 2 hours it felt longer and the narrative lacked a clear focus. And the ending was sadly very bad. It kept on stopping and starting, what i mean by that is it felt like the film had about 4 different endings. Also it felt like they couldn't decide how to end it so they just stuffed all 4 in to lazily set up a sequel so this was a shame.Overall despite good performances, visuals creativity and great humour the film falls flat with its lack of creative plot and its narrative weaknesses that makes the film overall disappointing.",The Gentlemen

153,gavinp9,Good British gangster story.,6,3 January 2020,"'The Gentlemen' is a return to Guy Ritchie's return to form. While no 'Snatch' or 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels', it's a mostly fun British gangster romp, with a token American, this time Mickey (McConaughey) as the pot-dealing kingpin. It's ironic in that they are mostly gentlemen in how they dress and how they speak, except or the number of c-bombs dropped! Great cast, but lots of players, so no one gets much of a chance to shine.Mickey's tale of selling his drug empire to Mathew (Strong) is told via a long discussion between Fletcher (Grant), a journalist, and Raymond (Hunnam), Mickey's right-hand-man. Grant is pretty funny trying to do a possibly Welsh accent. The device of using the discussion to show the narrative, means the film can go back and correct the story when it needs to. There's a few twists and turns and while it's fun watching Grant and Hunnam, the film really picks up in the final act when we're in ""real time"". Good to see Farrell have fun, as well as Golding and Dockery.The main problem with the narrative device is that Mickey doesn't seem real and McConaughey's character isn't really fleshed out. Solid ending, but not really enough action or drama to engage throughout. Some funny moments, but not really laugh-out-loud for the most part.",The Gentlemen

161,movieman6-413-929510,That Guy Ritchie delivers his own directing work with the Gentlemen again after a long time can be seen.,5,5 February 2020,"The Gentlemen is a new crime film action directed, partly written and produced by Guy Ritchie, the director of Aladdin, Sherlock Holmes, and Snatch.In the film, the American expat Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) wants to stop his profitable drug empire and there are rumors that he wants to sell this. However, if one of his drug plantations is sabotaged and robbed, his entire empire loses its value. Private detective Fletcher (Hugh Grant) tells Pearson his security man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) that he has information about who might be responsible for sabotage and theft. He asks a lot of money for this information and Ray is not even sure if the information is reliable. Fletcher keeps visiting Ray again and again to gain his confidence and to show that he has the correct information. In the meantime, Ray tries to do his own research to find out who is responsible for the actions to please his boss and so not to have to buy Fletcher information unnecessarily for a ridiculously high amount.
With this film, Guy Ritchie managed to direct his own film again, as he did at the start of his director's career with the films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. After these films, he directed more films where he had to follow a certain direction for the films and elements of the stories. This was the case with the Sherlock Holmes, the King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and the live-action Aladdin films. With these films his freedom and creativity were somewhat limited, but with the Gentlemen he has regained this freedom and creativity. That he did not get this freedom and creativity for some years can unfortunately be seen in this new film from him. He has made a somewhat chaotic story of it. In this film, many different story lines play together. The film is also filled with characters who all try to sabotage each other or scam each other in the hope of being able to get hold of the profitable drug empire itself. As a viewer, you have to pay attention and keep your attention to the film to be able to keep following the story, because the different story lines are mixed at a rapid pace. At the end of the film, some of these storylines have not really had any meaning for the film either, and so ultimately come across as time-wasting storylines that have only made the film unnecessarily lengthy.The cast does a good job in the film, but due to the size of the cast they are not all equally important. The film focuses primarily on the characters of Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant who tell each other the same events from the film and see whose story is most logical and credible. Other actors such as Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell and Mitchelle Dockery also play more smaller roles, some of which actually didn't matter at the end of the film.",The Gentlemen

168,patriciogl10,Guy Ritchie is back at it!,9,24 July 2020,"This film just proves that Guy Ritchie still has plenty of brilliance left in him, and that his top form has always been met with these types of stories.
Crime and gangsters is where his direction shines and his stories excel what is needed for the genre. He always seems to provide more, and yet leaves us wanting more. With a very clever script and masterful storytelling, Ritchie paints a charming and witty tale of colorful characters and funny situations that turn this into an incredibly entertaining film. Evidently this well-oiled machine works as well as it does not only because of Mr. Ritchie's outstanding ability to craft such a phenomenal piece of work but also the stellar cast that is featured in the film. From Matthew McCounaghey's serene and determined mob boss, to the awkward and calculating Fletcher played astonishingly by Hugh Grant, and the hilarious Colin Farrell, who steals every scene he is in, delivering his lines with such confidence and humour, which I don't believe is the character's intention, he speaks seriously but a lot of the things he says are actually really funny, which is something incredibly hard to pull without coming off as overdone or just plain fake. So kudos to Farrell, and the rest of the cast as well who give out splendid performances, which is hard to accomplish in an ensemble piece, but in this case, everyone is remarkable.The narrative aspect is another standout, which contains multiple layers and twists that keeps the story flowing freshly and creatively. I would go as far as to say that this is definitely one of Ritchie's best not only in the gangster genre but of his entire career. That's how great this film is: cohesively put together, a plot that doesn't tire at any minute but keeps you engaged and entertained thanks to its pace, clever writing, hilarious dialogue and spectacular performances. The Gentlemen is a no-brainer. Go watch it now and see what Guy Ritchie does best.",The Gentlemen

Fun and interesting characters, fast and interesting story with a little satire on everyone's account.

This is a real old-fashioned film, with wicked and entertaining characters, a film that doesn't burden itself with irrelevant nonsense, but wants to entertain the viewer, and that's the primary task of any film, and that's what many writers and directors often forget. The film is excellently directed, the cinematography is great, the cast is brilliant and it fits perfectly with its roles.

All the rest he has done since varied from ok to mediocre to poor to ok again but this entry in his filmography has unexpectedly taken a crown as being the best in it so far. The Gentlemen is a perfect blend of everything Mr Ritchie is known for - non-linear plot, twists and turns here and there, rich narrative and outstanding dialogues with tons of jokes, great performances from top notch actors - shout out to Colin Farrell and Charlie Hunnam for stealing most of the spotlight in this near perfect spectacle of a movie; I have to admit the first 10-15 minutes is a slowburner but after that there are balls of fire all the way.

Okay, end of movie. Let's find another. But wait, did we really see Michael killed? It did look like we would go back in time to the point of that killing, but we don't do that either. Read on.Instead we have a Private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) who gives a movie-long narrative for a movie he wants to produce, and that is basically this story titled Bush (Marijuana). The Story he says is in his imagination, but in reality, it is the story that we will see unfold. The truth is he wants money to not produce his movie or he will be forced to produce and let the world know all about Michael Pearson. Listening to him talking with Ray (Charlie Hunnam), who is Michael's right hand man and the bottom line is that Fletcher is blackmailing Ray to give him $20Million to keep his secrets. We don't know all the players and listening to him doesn't make much sense, but as he narrates, we see the story unfold. I do believe the story could have unfolded more easily without this narration. But that's just me.To make things easier here are the players who are out to get Michael's marijuana business: Chinaman Dry Eye (Henry Golding); and Oklahoma billionaire Big Dave (Eddie Marsan). That is basically all you need to know.
Notables: Michelle Dockery as Rosalind, Michael's wife; Colin Farrell as Coach, who runs a boxing training facility, and whose boys were the ones without his knowing who violated one of Michael's Marijuana farms. And this caused a big drop in price according to Matthew later on.Not sure why the Title of this movie is what it is. I didn't see any Gentlemen in here. There are twists in here, but keep in mind Michael is on top of everything as you will come to understand at the end.McConaughey is always good and is always on top of his game. Acting by all was very good.Not sure why this story was even told and put on film. A lot of what you will see in here is confusing and there is some unnecessary violence. The story itself did not impact me in any way as it was in my opinion a very simple story. That is to say forgettable. (5/10)Violence: Yes.

Nudity: No.

180,bastos,The King of the Genre,7,20 September 2020,"The opening monologue by Matthew McConaughey is a good sum up of Guy Ritchie's career, if you are the king of the jungle you need to prove it from time to time so that there is no doubt, and for those that had forgotten, Guy Ritchie is indeed the king of this genre. His English crime thrillers are so spectacularly entertaining that you are always having a good time watching them and time just flies by. I think the secret lies in the writing, with the creation of unforgettable side characters to his very elaborate stories. I mean who can forget Vinnie Jones in both Lock Stock and Snatch, or Brad Pitt in Snatch? Here it's Hugh Grant and Collin Farrell that steal the show, so much so that McConaughey's protagonist is a bit one dimensional and forgettable. But almost every other character is really good and has a moment to shine. One almost forgets that it's been twelve years since his last foray into the genre with RocknRolla, and more than twenty since Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels exploded to the screen. He has been a bit lost trying to build a successful franchise in Hollywood, and after some not so well received movies he came back to familiar ground and knocked it out of the park.

184,harrylosborne,Pleasantly surprised!,7,5 February 2020,"Guy Ritchie's reputation for cockney gangster films has begun to wane, as people have begun to forget their initial excitement over Brad Pitt and Vinnie Jones punching people in films like Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. More recently, Ritchie's big-screen productions have been underwhelming - those who've seen Aladdin and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword will no doubt agree. However, The Gentlemen is more his style of flick, and does a good job getting back to his best (namely, plots he understands).I am not a massive gangster fan, I must admit; Peaky Blinders doesn't do it for me, nor did any of the Godfathers (they are slow and boring - come get me). Quirky gangster films, however, have enough comedy and lightheartedness in them that I don't feel myself drowning in overacting, so I went into this with an open mind. My reward was a colourful world, more colourful characters, and a half-decent plot that wasn't content to meander, but kept you guessing. Loosely, the story follows Matthew McConaughey's Ricky, a drugs lord wanting out the game by selling his empire to the highest bidder. There are several interested parties with offers on the table, but nothing in the criminal underworld is as straightforward as that.The star of the film isn't the big-billed actors: it's not McConaughey (who, by the way, needs to be taught how to pronounce ""pint"" - I don't know why, but he actually butchered this one word ordering a drink at the start of the film), nor is it Charlie Hunnam as Ray, the right-hand man of the kingpin. No, the real gem in this film is none other than HUGH GRANT. I don't really watch romcoms, so I haven't seen him act before (to be fair, nobody who's seen him in a romcom has seen him act properly either), but Grant is exceptional as a sleazy reporter doing his best to earn a bit before everything goes mad. He is equal parts funny and sordid, and is the ideal foil to a plot that is guilty of occasionally taking itself too seriously.One casting issue I did have was, to be fair to Ritchie, always going to be a gamble: Bugzy Malone. Now it's not because he's a bad actor (to be honest, I didn't realise who it was until halfway through), but because Ritchie tried really, really hard to make grime music a part of the film. This isn't a vendetta against grime - it just didn't make a lot of sense when a music video was suddenly cut into the middle of a film, and made even less sense when the plot tried to justify why these street thugs started rapping on camera. It's only a minor plot point, but was jarring enough to take me out of the reality for a second, which really does nobody any favours.The Gentlemen delivers on what it promises. Guns, drugs, thugs, plenty of swearing and a touch of deceit to keep the more observant viewers guessing. Ritchie should stick to what he's good at - this is proof enough that he has a popular niche, and there's still something left in the tank.",The Gentlemen
185,tfminfl,Freakin Loved It!,10,27 February 2020,"395. The Gentlemen. Well alright, alright!! The first 5 or so minutes were kind of jumbled, my universal translator wasn't recognizing the cockney language right away. The McConaissance continues, he's usually the stoner but now, he's the big guy in charge of ""Bush"" game over in the UK. And now he's getting ready to retire and sell his herb empire, and he seems to be good to go, until some other interested buyers, or takers come into play, but when the cool calm and collected Mickey Pearson is pushed into a corner, well, first of all, you only think you pushed him into a corner and two he's gonna push back! Great movie from Guy Ritchie, more along the lines of Snatch than his recent gems like the Aladdin, King Arthur, Man from Uncle, or remember that time Madonna and him were together so he was forced by God to put her in a movie called Swept Away? Ugh... This is the kind of movie he shines, each character explodes on the screen. My favorite had to be Colin Farrell as Coach, and yes he is a basketball coach, and he does jobs for the organization and for fun beats up unruly teens.

186,Bertaut,"Nothing too unexpected here, but it's funny and hugely entertaining",8,14 January 2020,"The Gentlemen is a return to the London gangster milieu where writer/director Guy Ritchie first made his name with films such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000). His first foray into this territory since the disappointing RocknRolla (2008), The Gentlemen comes at the end of over a decade making big-budget studio-backed crimes against cinema. Granted, the film seems stuck in the last decade in more ways than one, it's highly questionable that the only gay character is a slimy S&M proponent who'll sleep with pretty much anyone, its token female character barely even manages to rise to the level of tokenism, and Ritchie does absolutely nothing new here - if you've seen Lock, Stock or snatch., you'll know pretty much exactly what to expect - but The Gentlemen is still hugely entertaining. Most of the jokes land, the dialogue is as sharp and expletive-laden as ever, the cast are having a ball, and the self-reflexivity, although a little forced in places, works well for the most part. And yes, the plot is as derivative as it gets, but there's no denying Ritchie has injected real verve into what looks on paper like an inconsequential C-movie. The Gentlemen definitely won't change your life, but it will make you laugh.The film begins as sleazy private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) arrives unannounced at the home of Ray (Charlie Hunnam), right-hand man to Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a suave Oxford-educated American ex-pat who controls a huge marijuana empire in London, valued at around £400 million. Several months prior, Fletcher was hired by tabloid editor Big Dave (the great Eddie Marsan) to dig up dirt on Pearson with the aim to ruin him - Dave's revenge for Pearson blanking him at a gala. Fletcher has written a screenplay based on his investigation (titled Bush) and tells Ray that unless Pearson pays him £20 million, he will hand over everything he has to Dave. Meanwhile, Pearson has decided to sell his whole operation, but when word gets out, all hell breaks loose, as the various interested parties vie for advantage. Most of the subsequent film takes the form of Fletcher narrating his exploits to Ray, explaining how he learned so much about Pearson and what he does. Along the way, we meet characters such as Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), Pearson's ruthless and unflappable ""cockney Cleopatra"" wife, who runs a garage with an all-female staff; Berger (Jeremy Strong), Pearson's preferred buyer; Dry Eye (Henry Golding), the ambitious but brutal scion of a Chinese syndicate, who hopes to undermine Berger; Coach (a scene-stealing Colin Farrell), who runs a boxing gym for troubled youths and who inadvertently finds himself in the middle of everything; a plethora of property-rich-but-cash-poor landed gentry who are essential to Pearson's empire; a Russian oligarch; and a street gang called The Toddlers.Aesthetically, The Gentlemen is very much in the mould of Ritchie's previous gangster movies. Because Fletcher frames his narration as a screenplay, it allows Ritchie to employ a multitude of self-reflexive devices - a smash cut coinciding with Fletcher asking Ray to visualise a smash cut; voiceover transitioning into spoken dialogue; on-screen captions telling us who's who; animated maps; YouTube fight porn (don't ask); freeze-frames; rewinds; a shot of film running through a projector etc. At one point, Fletcher is discussing the merits of anamorphic (2.39:1) over 1.78:1, and the film's aspect ratio changes accordingly. At another, he's arguing for the merits of 35mm celluloid over digital, saying he likes the grain of celluloid photography, and the film duly switches formats. Such playfulness means that it never for a second takes itself too seriously, with probably the most self-reflexive moment coming towards the end, when we visit Miramax's offices in London (Miramax produced the movie), and we see a poster for Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015). All of this is immensely fun, with the more you know about the mechanics of assembling a film, the more humorously self-reflexive the film becomes - Fletcher even acknowledges his own role as an unreliable narrator.In terms of themes, the most obvious is something Ritchie has examined before - the idea that the economic divide between gangsters and aristocrats masks their practical similarities. Pearson straddles this divide; he's a gangster, but so too is he an aristocrat (in all but name), and the smooth running of his business depends on both classes - the aristocrats who he needs to grow his product (for reasons that constitute a bit of a spoiler, so I'm not going to get into it) and the gangsters who distribute that product. The clash between the pompous insularity of the English upper class and the perceived uncouthness of the lower class has been done to death in both literature (Wuthering Heights (1847) springs to mind) and film (Performance (1970), for example), and although Ritchie doesn't say anything even remotely new about it, it still forms an interesting textural background - gentrification is ever-present; there are ironic references to the posh areas of Croydon; Ray, a working-class Newcastle native, is a cleanliness freak who eats wagyu steak and lives in a mansion, and when he's dispatched on a mission to an uncivilised working-class area, he explains he ""just hates them junkies,"" seeing them as very much his social inferiors.One of the most central scenes sees a group of obnoxious privileged teens holed up in a council flat, whilst on the street below, a gang of machete-wielding delinquents terrorise the neighbourhood. As Ray and his men clash with the gang, there's a real sense of old vs. new - traditional gangsters fighting it out with internet-savvy hoodlums who don't give a damn about tradition or respect. There are a lot of laughs to be had with these issues, such as Ray and Coach having problems pronouncing the name Phuc. And again, none of this is presented as even remotely serious.The biggest problems with the film are probably its lack of depth, and the familiarity of the presentation, characters, and milieu - there's nothing here you haven't seen in previous Ritchie films. And as you would expect, there isn't much in the way of emotional maturity or narrative complexity. It's all very surface-level, and it makes no apologies for such.Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed The Gentlemen. It's a funny as hell caper and the actors are clearly having terrific fun. It might be formulaic and overly familiar, but it's also immensely enjoyable.",The Gentlemen
187,krational66,emmm,6,27 April 2020,"Pseudo-multi-line narrative, the line of the newspaper boss is only to increase drama conflict, and removing it will not hinder. The line of the wrestler is even the gold finger of the screenwriter who madly hangs. When there is no crisis that cannot be solved, he suddenly kills the enemy. Like ""Theft and Smuggling"" and ""Two Big Cigarettes"", Geric wants to shoot a farce caused by a small incident, but the script level is no longer as good as it once was. There is no longer the kind of hearty refreshing feeling that year. But fortunately, Gerici is a clever director, he knows how to modify the details of the story to cover up the flaws and increase the visibility (an interesting narrator, the suspense of the opening ""one shot""), he can write lines, and Very good at editing, so the tension of at least a few highlight scenes is still preserved.

It's another kinda dark, gritty, bloody, messy but quite enjoyable piece by Guy.Set in UK, it follows different narrative than usual for storytelling sake and it can be quite fun, somewhat predictable but fun. It gives you feeling like you are in the third person there and watching show that just keeps giving something to hold onto and keep you interested. There is also plenty of humor that sometimes is childish but mostly is pretty good and fits the scenes.The moment when you see tracksuit guys you in for the ride, there is no doubt that they will fail as they are absolutely wacky characters and perform things that you would expect from them. Colin Farrell being one of them is mesmerising, you can watch him speak with his accent and it's great. His character (Coach) will leave you laughing to your bones cause it's bloody dark and beautiful comedy if you have that kind of wiring for humor.Now the rest of guys are also pretty good, starting with McCounaghey playing our lead (Mickey Pearson). He is great you can't hold anything against him because he's a go guy for these kind of things also Hunnam playing Ray is tough, scary, funny and just a gold to watch. Hugh Grant is also pretty good at what he does sometimes you would wish his character (Fletcher) was a bit smarter but he fits at his place.Writing and telling this story is just classical Guy Ritchie style that even if you didn't know it was him that did this you would probably guess him if you saw any of his movies. His directing skills and writing are pretty much all the same but in this movie he has a bit different approach to certain things and there are instances where he magnifies humor with them which is greatly appreciated.It's funny, back to his roots movie with bloody and confrontational scenes that yell its crime comedy even though it's not what you might expect but it is very enjoyable. 3.5/4",The Gentlemen
189,Lewis_Heather787,I cannot believe the high scores !!!!,3,12 January 2020,"Now did I watch something different to everyone else???? To me Guy Ritchie just needs a break from these types of films, to be honest at times it felt like someone was making a ""Guy Ritchie"" rip off. I am shocked, to say the least, at the positive response to this film............its was so poor, and I had no expectations going in at all!!!!!The only ok part of the film for me is, that its mildly entertaining, it wasn't dull. Even though I really really didn't like the film, I will definitely disagree with anyone who tries to say they were bored watching it. There are some occasional laughs to have along the way, however for me its just not enough to cover up from the mind-numbingly bad decisions that were made.The dialogue ! Its laughably bad, I know there is meant to be a certain cockney sort of stereotype in Guy Ritchie's films but this was just so far over the mark. Everyone was just playing a caricature of that type of stereotype and it was straight from the beginning. It stuck out to me and just couldn't escape my mind how silly it looked. The opening scene look how McConaughey dials the number in his phone.............face palm..... I suppose you buy into this stupid reality that is created and go along for the ride but to me no, I just couldn't take any of them seriously...........it was ludicrous!!The acting isn't at its best there are a lot of people coasting, McConaughey looks completely bored thinking what happened to the McCnaissance apart from when he gets angry now and then. I don't really like Charlie Hunman I think he is always trying to hard, but thats me?!?! He accent is always all over the place in pretty much every film he is in, this one is no different. Colin Farrell is taking a pay check and just looks like he learned his lines about a min before shooting. The only person I would say that was doing anything different or at least trying was Hugh Grant who was different to say the least. Had some good laughs but was also probably the worse culprit of the stereotypical accent or just weird persona created.Overall I am really shocked and stunned by the positivity surrounding this film, it came out in January for a reason..........its the garbage month of the year!?!? For me its 30% out of 100 its pretty bad if you ask me for the reasons I've given, I'd high recommend it to people to avoid, don't waste your time watch one of Guy Ritchie's films from early in his career, not this wannabe!",The Gentlemen

193,cordenw,Now that's a movie!,8,21 October 2020,"Right from the getgo you know you're in for something good. It's a story about the drug business ( specifically MJ ) in posh old England, a story about how difficult it is to get out once you're in knee deep.Of course when you're a top dog in a business like the drug trade, you can't give your boss two weeks notice. You have to carefully manage your exit so you get out alive, cos it's much cheaper to take it over if the boss is dead.With Matthew David McConaughey wearing his rôle like an well tailored suit, Hugh Grant as a sleazy blackmailing cockney ( leaving his plummy accent behind) and the rest of the cast fitting together like a jigsaw puzzle, you have some great working materialThe London crime scene is so much more intelligent than the North American shootfests we are used to, sort of like Downton Abbey against Dallas, and this movie cashes in on the intellectual nature of the criminals. They're all so smart!It's Guy Ritchie at his best, he explains things as the plot unfolds without breaking the storyline.He injects humour into nasty situations, pulls off plot twists that are perfectly believable and, something which is Ritchie's true talent, he makes the villains likeable.No woke undercurrents in this project, that I can tell you.... and I'm still trying to get over hearing Michelle Dockery using the ""f"" word.. something Lady Mary Crawley would faint over if she heard it.A few weak moments in the plot ( which is why I only rated it an 8 ) but you can expect that with the tangled stories that are the hallmarks of his films.Sit back and enjoy this one",The Gentlemen

204,hunter-friesen,"Ritchie returns home with stylish ""Gentlemen""",6,6 April 2020,"Like Wes Anderson, Tim Burton and Michael Bay, you can tell when a film is made by Guy Ritchie just by watching a few minutes of it. The British director has carried a sense of hyper stylization through each of his films, most notably in crime comedies that began with the one-two punch of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch."" Now, after a few big studio duds (""King Arthur,"" ""Aladdin""), Ritchie has come home to his roots with ""The Gentlemen.""Growing tired of the marijuana business and fearing for the security of his future, Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) decides he wants to sell his lucrative empire. Luckily for him, a rich American buyer is willing to fork over a pretty penny. Unluckily for Mickey though, his life of crime has made him a few enemies that would like nothing more than to see him ruined. With his enemies fast approaching on all sides, Mickey will now have to get his hands dirtier than ever if he ever wants to have a chance to clean them off.""The Gentlemen"" is business as usual for Ritchie as he dives right back into the street crime genre he made his name in.What may seem overindulgent to others is only conventional to Ritchie as he uses all the flashy tactics in the book. Even the opening credits - which contain numerous minor spoilers for some odd reason - remind one of a Bond film. After that, we are led on an endless parade of rapid editing, exaggerated characters and many other stylish facets. It's a bombardment of the senses, but one that never becomes overbearing.However, like all Ritchie films, ""The Gentlemen"" ends up leaning too hard on style over substance, which is saying a lot because there is a lot of substance here. Some directorial choices seem to be made only for vanity, such as one bit where a character drones on about the magic of classic cinema. I was reminded of the great ""Jurassic Park"" quote which I am paraphrasing: ""Ritchie was so preoccupied with whether or not he could; he didn't stop to think if he should.""Such is the case in Ritchie's previous crime films: there are plots within plots, and those plots have plots on top of them. In this film, the narrative revolves around a discussion between two characters as one tells the other about the events that have unfolded. These events are new to us but have already happened within the timeframe of the film. What we get is a sort of comedic murder mystery where each event is changed and then rechanged again based upon a certain character's perspective on what happened.This framing device makes the movie an interesting puzzle, albeit a needlessly convoluted one. Specific details sometimes get lost in the shuffle, only to come back again to confuse us more. Just like the directing, this problem seems to stem from Ritchie's insistence on overdoing things. It's quantity over quality as too many things are thrown into the script without much regard for clarity or purpose.Since his Oscar win in 2014, Matthew McConaughey has had a hard time picking projects that use his acting strengths and that also turns out to be good. Thankfully, Mr. ""Alright, Alright, Alright"" chose wisely here as Ritchie uses his captivating screen presence in some impressive monologues.Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant play the two characters having a banterous discussion around the film's events. Grant easily takes the top spot between the two as he seems to thoroughly enjoy his character's eccentric quirks.Rounding out the cast is Jeremy Strong, Henry Golding and, most notably, Colin Farrell as a boxing coach simply named ""Coach."" Even though Mickey is the main character, Coach is the one you'll remember the most after.It can be easy to forget sometimes that movies are allowed to solely be entertaining popcorn flicks. This rings truer during awards season when every film is trying to take a stand on something and fighting to make a mark on our culture.Of course, you still would like that popcorn flick to be well-made. Being as how January is usually a dumping ground for maligned films, you could do a lot worse than this enjoyable romp.",The Gentlemen

I enjoyed this dark comedy, it was a little too mindless non the less.",The Gentlemen
208,FKDZ,Solid Film!,8,10 March 2020,"Just came back from the theater and I have to say it was a fun ride with some solid acting and cinematography.So personally I'm not all to familiar with Guy Ritchie's films, but if anything I feel like I know his style from seeing this movie, and it's really enjoyable for the most part. This movie really likes to play with modern toys of editing and some cool visuals, like when Fletcher and Ray are talking about movie formats. It's fun and different from the traditional stuff and I like that.Now, first off the Directing, really solid with some really pretty shots in the film. Most of the movie is very static, camera on a tripod kinda style, but once there's action it goes loose, really making stuff chaotic and pulling you out from the serenity. It doesn't go overboard with cuts and crazy camera shake though, that's a good thing, its very well balanced and the violence is visceral and engaging. I already addressed it a bit but this movie can be really pretty at times, great color grading and set design.Acting was fantastic in this, my only issues were with Hugh Grant and Hunnam, the latter being a bit wooden/flat at times, but with does have some highs. Grant was the comedic relief and he did okay, sometimes it just felt a bit out there. Standouts where Colin Farrell and McConaughey, great stuff. Dialog was good too, definitely has some funny moments written in that worked well, and the harsher lines worked great too.Music, don't always address this but what there was was good and effective, and some really interesting choices, loved it.Now story, this is where most of my negatives come from. The movie starts with a cold open where Michael gets shot (you assume). It's fun and gets you into the movie nice and fast, then it's slowly burns up till about the last 20 or so minutes. During that slow burn there was some fun but a lot of it was setting storylines up, backgrounds and characters. The point of the movie where it got to slow for me was the scene before they threw that russian kid out the window (we'll get to that later). There was just so much buildup to a really short scene without a strong payoff in the scene itself, they decided to cut the plummeting of the russian kid which took me out of it for a bit. The movie does this a lot by the way, it likes to have ''cliffhangers'' which the way it tells the story, sometimes this works great, other times, not so much. Then we get to the finale, first off Matthew doesn't get a full ending and resolve, so we have to assume he transferred the money and did the deed, which is a bit lacking.Then comes the russian out of nowhere, so far we had some great backstory to most of our characters, but Atlas(?) the russian kid thrown out the roof, apparently had a rich dad which ended up putting a hit on Pearson. This came way too fast and outta nowhere, felt like it needed a small scene or 2 to establish this russian guy was actually mad/seeking revenge.Third, the ''you didn't play me, I played you! trope'' got used which is okay if there are clues sprinkled in the movie, but there weren't, not once did we know Ray was outsmarting Fletcher besides the one on one dialog maybe where we can sense some confidence but that's reaching. It was actually shown that Ray WASN'T that smart with his encounter with the kid who's phone he needed. And after that you're telling me he's in a ghillie suit spying on the professional detective spying on them? The whole movie is about tying up loose ends and connecting the dots, and it missed a few dots so to say, not dramatically though, the story is still strong, just felt a tiny bit rushed.At the end of the day I still really enjoyed the movie, fun fact with all the killing and crime, not a single cop in this movie, just a casual mention or two.For me 7.5/10 , would recommend.",The Gentlemen
209,Semisonic,Ritchie for zoomers,5,21 April 2020,"Manner maketh man, as a certain character once said. And Guy Ritchie has turned The Gentlemen into a showcase for that undisputed truth. However, the same character also said that a villain's quality is crucial for the whole film's well-being, and that is where this movie falls flat on its bum.The best Ritchie's films can be described in one sentence: a little triumph for a little guy. Lock & Stock, Snatch and even Rocknrolla are built about the fate of small-time people with quite limited prospects in life. Yes, they are clever, funny and often very lucky, but it's never a ""rags to riches forever"" story, more like a ""rags to riches to probably lots of irrational spending and rags again"" one. And that's what makes those films fun and protagonists relatable for the masses: we all enjoy seeing little men screw over big men once in a while, without becoming the evil they were destined to fight.Here, however, we are supposed to sympathize with a big, very big man and his top minion. I agree that Matthew McConaughey is extremely charismatic and his vocal manner makes my ears melt in ecstasy, and that Charlie Hunnam looks quite the man with a full beard. But Ritchie invests so much into the ""protagonist"" side, yet leaves so little for the ""antagonist"" one. The ""bad guys"" are nether imposing nor cunning nor even well presented enough. You are inclined to root for the good guys because they are usually outnumbered and maybe even outgunned, but here there's no true sense of worthy confrontation, which makes you wish the ""bush brothers"" to break a leg in a literal, not a theatrical sense.All this leaves us with one sad conclusion, that Guy Ritchie still knows how to do things in style but totally forgot how to bring in the substance (except the controlled ones of course, they are still aplenty). All this street gang stuff, fight porn and rap clips, and even the selfie time homage might be fun for those born on this side of the century, but for us old-timers the creative decline is quite obvious.But even today's Ritchie could not have come without a single ace up his sleeve. Hugh Grant as a well-mannered, slightly over the hedge and a tad too clearly mancraving fox of a gentleman, is a true soul of this feature, a real reason to watch this film through. And at the end, he's the only one you truly wanna root for. Which is quite symbolic, because that's the very character who's practically begging for a sequel through what used to be the fourth wall. Don't know about y'all, but I'm interested only if they film what he's writing, kinky parts included.",The Gentlemen

212,snowfre,A starry ensemble that never manages to reach their full potential in this flat drama,7,10 March 2020,"""The Gentlemen"" is a fast phased movie packed with action, undoubtedly a Guy Ritchie production. It features many of his typical themes, flamboyant men involved in criminality, that ends up in - slightly bizarre - situations and conflicts. To be honest, the film isn't the most memorable crime drama of the 21st century, and the story itself both lacks originality and suffers slightly from too familiar plot elements. Nevertheless, ""The Gentlemen"" is entertaining, and its 2-hour length flies past you quite fast. What I really missed watching Ritchie's latest crime-gentleman movie (they all feature quite similar characters honestly) were more fleshed our characters. Some less clichéd ones would also beneficial to the story. The all-star cast never reaches its full potential, with Matthew McConaughey struggling with possibly the flattest character of them all. Instead, this is Charlie Hunnam and High Grant's film. Yes, that Hugh Grant. The English Duke of Cheesy Romcoms. He makes what I believe to be his best performance to dat as the cunning and greedy journalist Fletcher. When leaving the cinema and contemplating over ""The Gentlemen"", I realize what is most memorable with this quite blend film, is actually Hugh.

220,eelen-seth,A ruthless first-class kick in the teeth!,9,1 January 2020,"The rather unconventional visionary Guy Ritchie has been stuck in a Hollywood rut for the last ten years, ever since he committed to big budget, visual effects heavy films, such as Sherlock Holmes, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and this year's underwhelming live action version of the classic Disney, 'Aladdin'. The British director goes back to his roots with the highly entertaining gangster film 'The Gentlemen' and surprisingly nails every bold punch he makes.Although his 'Aladdin' made a ton of money, critically the film was a disaster. His return to the underground world of bribery, drugs, money-laundering and blood-covered-class, is as refreshing as it is entertaining. The film's script deals with two storylines at the same time, almost breaking the fourth wall with a tongue-in-cheek commentary on today's Hollywood and how big movie studios are hungry for some original yet overly mainstream basic content, to lure people into cinemas to go watch their films.Beginning with a quick flash forward that ends with a bang and a pair of brains splattered all over a pint and a pickled egg at a typical British pub, we dial it back to a quiet evening at Raymond's (Charlie Hunnam) cosy house. When private investigator and intrusive sly fox, Fletcher (Hugh Grant), turns up at his house, he explains he has been keeping an eye on the different gangs around town for quite a while. Narrating most of the film and making some stuff up to make things more spectacular for himself, he reads his mostly finished movie script to Raymond, bribing him into funding his little project, or else he'll leak all the information he has on Raymond's boss Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a white trash American expat who has build himself a marijuana empire.Mickey is tired of the business and is trying to sell his highly profitable company to a dynasty of Oklahoma billionaires. But when one of the underground weed-plantations gets raided by a group of British lads, filming the entire thing and posting it on YouTube as some sort of fight--music-video, it quickly becomes clear some mobster bosses haven't been exactly honest about their meetings and loyalty towards each other. This is when the real war begins - while keeping it classy.Ritchie co-wrote the story with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, who haven't written anything before. The idea of the entire film is prodigious, but the screenplay and dialogue is simply unprecedented by Ritchie himself, bringing joke after joke, while taking you on a thrilling ride full of genius twists and new ways to incorporate classic gangster cinema - Ritchie-style. Composer Christopher Benstead is debuting his very first score for a feature film with The Gentlemen, and knows exactly how to set the tone and drive it up to an eleven. A promising talent that won't go unnoticed.Ritchie introduces new characters throughout the film, keeping the audience on the edge of their seat, surprising them with actual cinema, getting the best angles and money shots, thanks to his cinematographer Alan Stewart (Aladdin). When adding layer after layer to the story, going deeper into the underground scene, adding a new protagonist who's into human trafficking and Mickey's queen and wife, the cockney Cleopatra, Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), who owns a sanctuary for the ladies as some sort of business coverup to her husband's weed-empire, it becomes clear every role has a purpose and there are no extras involved in this story. One of the best acting ensembles in recent cinema history, and a welcome reminder from McConnaughey as to why he won an Oscar in the first place. But it's Colin Farrell (as the highly entertaining 'Coach') and Hugh Grant who steal every scene they're in with their remarkable wit that'll for sure land them some BAFTA-nominations.'The Gentlemen' is a ruthless first-class kick in the teeth. Do not let the failures of Ritchie's recent career choices scare you, as this is actually one of the best films he's ever made. Who knew Guy Ritchie could raise the bar not just for himself, but for everyone out there trying to brush him off as a has been. 2020 is off to a great start!",The Gentlemen

This movie is so cool, from the slick, fast, sometimes even poetic dialogue, the accents, the performances, the characters. Everything about it screams Guy Ritchie and it is really good.There are some scenes in the movie that I think will become classics and maybe this movie will too, I don't know, only time will tell, but a lot of it reminded me of the cleverness of the characters in Snatch. The performances are fantastic, I think Hugh Grant is the best I've ever seen him ever, with a completely different accent and also Charlie Hunnam is so damn cool here, as well.The only negatives I have with the film is that, as is usual for a Guy Ritchie film is that from the very beginning it moves at breakneck speed, introduces a bunch of characters and quite honestly, at times in the film I didn't really know what they were talking about. And also, I love Guy Ritchie, but sometimes he does sacrifice substance for style and I think in some scenes the same thing happens here.I though the first act was the weakest because it introduced too many characters and plot lines, but the movie got better each minute, and I really liked it in the end and definitely want to watch it again, soon.",The Gentlemen

The narration the way movie unfolds its key events ,introduction of the casts, the back and forth timelines makes its familiar premise both likable and watchable. Matthew McConaughey as always never disappoints as a leading Man of the movie. Michelle Dockery has brief role but looked Gorgeous as hell.",The Gentlemen

Although everything may seem redundant and not really original when watching, the film offers a perfect characterization of the characters (also due to the excellent actor performances), well-prepared contextualization and a plot with a logical thread never broken. It is entertaining, funny and gritty: simply a good job.",The Gentlemen
230,pritol,Guy Ritchie...back on form!,8,16 October 2020,"Guy Ritchie is as synonymous with British Gangster movies, as Scorsese is with American Mobsters.After the heights of Lock Stock, and Snatch, it's been a while since Ritchie produced a truly great Gangster flick. Rock n Rolla wasn't bad at all, but it didn't have the ""zing"" or magnetism of the earlier films.The Gentlemen is a very welcome return to form, arguably his best work. The plot revolves around a major weed dealer who is looking to exit the criminal world....but will it really be that easy?! (Cinematic history tells us...no, it will not).The ensemble cast is absolutely fantastic, with everyone bringing their A Game. If you had to pick one standout it would be Hugh Grant who is hilarious and brilliant as the sleazy PI, ""Fletcher"".The way it's shot, is more traditional in nature, with less short shot collages, but as always the soundtrack is great, and more importantly the dialogue is on point! It has an impeccable balance between serious and satyr, all the way through...some moments are genuinely hilarious! (Normally around Colin Farrell).The story has a few twists and turns, and keeps you in uncertain territory right until the end!",The Gentlemen
231,brooksrob1,"Alright, alright, alright!",10,15 April 2020,"A Great movie for those that love quick and snappy dialog, with a mix of violence, a mass of twist and turns - As well as a balls to the wall pace.There are many reviewers comparing this to Snatch. And, I can see where that idea came from... It is a Ritchie movie after all but; that's where the comparative stops. This movie (The Gentlemen) is to Snatch, as Rocky is to Rocky 4... This is a sophisticated Guy Ritchie. A well seasoned pro. The actors are all master mechanics. It's poetry in motion...Great movie; just watch it...:)10/10",The Gentlemen

It's hilarious and a great intelligent crime film.Everyone is terrific here. All delivering great performances. For me the stand out was Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell who provide some of the best moments of the film.It's a very creative and stylish film and I wouldn't say there are many flaws in the film. It's a story which gets a fresh and unique take on it and Guy Ritchie really out did himself here.Also ""old McDonald had a farm"" is used hilariously here.",The Gentlemen
233,ssvfolder-1,"The best one in its genre since ""Snatch""",8,28 March 2020,"I've missed this. That is a high class ""Guy Ritchie"" movie with a bit more brighter than usual atmosphere. Lock Stock, had discovered Jason Statham along with Vinnie Jones. Snatch was the better follow up. Now finally we get the good new version of the same genre packed with movie stars, and chemistry that actually works. McConaughey delivered an outstanding performance, as it one of the characters he was born to play. He does not succeed in every role, but some of them are a perfect fit. Hugh Grant did an excellent job,as this role was different than his usual movies. For the first time in many years, I loved Colin Farrel as a cool coach, as his chemistry with Hunnam and charismatic presence filled every scene he was at.
Now for some of the weaker points of the movie.
I loved Charlie Hunnam ever since Green street hooligans, yet I didn't feel that was the perfect role for him. His character is cool, resourceful and smart. Yet it felt that for some scenes, he was a bit out of pace. Fir example the scenes with the junkies, some deeper disgust form his part was missing from the formula. He still delivered, but for this movie to be a masterpiece, it should have been some one else.
The story could have been a bit deeper. It was missing some edge, especially towards the end. That's where the whole idea of Lock Stock and Snatch shined the most, Gentlemen dropped a ball a bit. It needs a different ending.
The eccentric antagonist of the movie is not a good counterpart to McConaughey. That casting was off entirely. It felt like Jesse Aisenberg iin the role of Lex Luthor.Other than that, this movie is great and I hope Guy Ritchie will consider to do a follow up.",The Gentlemen

Visually the movie look great and is very stylised to suit to mood of the film. The characters are great, all with great acting as well that create intense scenes. The last forty minutes of the movie is completely dedicated to reveal after reveal that just blows your mind further and further adding to the confusion but you simply can't not enjoy. The action is pretty good, it's very grounded which definitely suits the movie.

It's evident that analyzing the singular characters of the movie, indeed, each of them appears absurd enough and idiot as well, such as part of a stupid plot. One of the most stupid character is the reporter. All appears exaggerated in order to get the lovely happy ending. Yes, the recitation is good enough but cannot save the high stupidity of this movie.

That was my first thought. And I loved it. Also, Jeremy Strong needs to be higher on casting directors speed dial. He's a Swiss Army actor. He was awesome in The Big Short.

There all the perfect ingredients we expect in a comedy crime thriller filled with witty dialogues and twists.Matthew McConaughey finally gets his much need break since Interstellar and he is very convincing as an American expat in London.

258,tmpsvita,Not as good as most of Ritchie's movies but as entertaining as every of them,7,12 December 2020,"This movie came in a really predictable way into Guy Ritchie's filmography. After one big flop, (king Arthur) which I sill liked, and a big-budget and definitely not authorial one (Aladdin), Ritchie returns in his safe zone with an extremely (for his career) canonical movie, it's frenetic, noisy, fancy, elaborated and it has his signature in every shot and every dialog both so sophisticated and studied that risk to be redundant as usual.
But here there's more talk and less shoot or punch and that's where ""the gentlemen"" find its problem: it makes you smell the tension, the action scenes, the climax but it never really comes or hits as it wanted to.
It's a bit a disappointment cause Richie is great with action scenes, he knows how to direct them with charisma and intelligence but, and this is how he makes this movie still be good despite the nearly absence of action and the underwhelming climax (probably caused also by some twist that didn't worked perfectly), but, as I was saying, he's also really good at makes every line, every dialog feels like a fun and satisfying fight scenes.
So at the end ""The Gentleman"" has his flaws and it could be better but even if it's not as good as most of Ritchie's movies, it's still as entertaining, fun and full of style as every of them",The Gentlemen

262,brianjohnson-20043,Not my cup of tea,3,6 February 2020,"I wanted to like this film. But I just couldn't. It wasn't comedic to me. And it didn't strike a cord of being a real-life engaging thriller to me either. It's very stylized. And although style can work in certain circumstances when the viewer is appropriately brought on-board. I felt like the plane left without me. A style really doesn't work if the characters become too artificial while trying to play-off an essence of reality at the same time.Much of the story about the main character (McConaughey's) is delivered as investigative conjecture from another character(Grant's). So as the narrator character reveals the main character's story, the narrator can later change the result of events we perceive by just revealing that the conjecture he presented before was inaccurate. This gets old really fast.Maybe this can work if the conjecture is absurd and funny or if the conjecture rings very true most of the time. That way it surprises the viewer when it's revealed to be wrong. But as I explained before, I didn't overall get a sense of either quality within the story-telling.Overall the film seemed very ambitious. But all of the pieces didn't seem to quite make sense to me together. And they might have been better off removing a few elements for this particular script.I wasn't too sympathetic for the characters I was supposed to be sympathetic for. I didn't understand the logic to some of the character decisions. Some of the moments of ""big reveals"" didn't seem too surprising to me. And a lot of the narration got annoying to me. More often than not it's better to show than tell the viewer what they need to know. I didn't think the voiceover was helpful in showing but telling. To put it simply, I felt it was more style than more substance. And the music didn't seem to help the storytelling to me either.I hope you like it if you see. But I also hope that if you have similar concerns and inclinations as me, that my review might spare you some time and/or money. I know I wish I had stayed away from this one.",The Gentlemen

267,CriticalOfEverything,Welcome back Ritchie.,8,6 February 2020,"After such a long period of repeated missfires and last year's disastrous Aladdin remake, Guy Ritchie has divorced himself from the mouse and has come back in full swing with The Gentlemen, a film harking back to his two previous cult classic gangster films ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"". And it's just what you would want if you loved those movies. The acting is pretty good all around and the pacing is as quick as you'd expect, but what really makes this movie is the writing itself. Just like with Snatch and Lock Stock, the dialogue is clever, witty and has a lot more meaning behind it than you may realise, which is another thing I love about Ritchie's films: They actually require you to PAY ATTENTION. So many people just switch a film on and don't think about anything that's happening. Ritchie basically bends those people over and forces them to think about what is happening and what is being said. This is why you find a lot of people who say they found Snatch to be confusing due to all of the plotlines happening at the same time as well as them not paying attention to what is actually being said. Which is a shame because the dialogue in Ritchie's films is insanely funny and brimming with wit. Snatch is probably better in terms of dialogue simply because I can quote every line in the film at this point, but The Gentlemen has a lot of great lines for sure. It isn't all humour of course, but I thought I'd just go over what makes Ritchie's films so good when compared to other things released nowadays.Overall I would HIGHLY recommend The Gentlemen for people who loved Ritchie's previous gangster films as well as those who haven't watched anything he's made before and want a good place to start. It may be hard to get used to, especially with how vulgar it is compared to the rest of the politically correct garbage being dumped out of Hollywood these days, but it's certainly worth paying to see.",The Gentlemen

271,GavWaskett,'Brilliance should be acknowledged.' - Matthew,9,13 September 2020,"Guy Ritchie is back to his best dealing with subjects he is a master of, East London and gangs. This film is full of action, gratuitous violence and comedy. It hits the mark in all that it does.Matthew McConaughey is Pearson, the main man is the local drug business who is looking to move on and retire from the life. His future purchasers are trying to get better deals for themselves and he is having issues with the respectable drug addled daughter of some rich friends. His right-hand man, Raymond (Charlie Hunnam) is there to sort out problems and find solutions. His wife Rosalind (Michelle Dockery) has her own business and her own problems. Coach (Colin Farrell) trains the local youths and tries to keep them on the straight and narrow and when he can't he sorts out their screw ups and Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is a PI hired to do a job and rather enjoying himself doing it.As you would expect with any great Guy Ritchie film, there are twists and turns galore and plenty of laughs along the way. Charlie Hunnam is superb, in fact Sons of Anarchy is the only thing I've seen him better in. He carries a threat about him with a sense of enjoyment in what he does. Colin Farrell, who I have no strong feelings about either way, is fantastic as Coach who is very very dangerous but only when he has to be and is more concerned about his students.This is one of the better films I've seen recently and I will happily put this up there with Lock Stock and hope it is remembered with the same fondness by everyone. Though be warned there is more than a few casual C Bombs dropped! Well done Mr Ritchie, well done!

277,Criticalstaff,Amazing Guy Ritchie masterpiece.,3,12 April 2020,"This is not a great movie. It is not even a movie. it is a glorified GQ magazine issue made into film.Technically it is an action film. Technically it is Guy Ritchie sleazy british comedy. But really you are spending two hours watching Matthew McConaughey change outfits. One time he has a burgundy suit, then a smoking jacket, then something else. Really i forgot the other outfits: I liked the smoking jacket, I think that is the one for me.
Oh and by the way Matthew McConaughey is American; I don't know what you will do with this info but it is in the movie, so you all should know.Charlie Hunnam is sporting a modern beard, which has the appearnace of being scruffy but from up close it apperas well kept and clean. It plays well on his outfit because it contrasts with his suit and tie preppy look. Also when you are a mobster that need to chase parkour enthusiasts, make sure to get that genuine leaher strap for you automatic silenced rifle that you are jogging with.
It will help you carry that 6.8lbs gun while you are running in a three-piece suit, but more importantly it will also match your oxfords.If you are looking for some fine scotch to enjoy while Hugh Grant sabotages his career, try out Glenfarclas , its smooth and it looks good.There are not a lot of opportunities to BBQ outside in England so you will absolutely want to check out this lovely barbercue table with built-in fire. It can really give your garden some cachet, especially when you have people over.The movie also portrays characters? I am not sure, things happen on screen, they kill a russian teenager I think, the Lion is selling weed technology. If you can sort these words in order good for you, it doesn't really matter
Colin Farell is dressed in a track suit and is the mentor of a Youtube channel, where I can only imagine we can find his merch in the bio, otherwise I don't see how he can monetize his content. It really makes you think how technology has changed the way we buy and percieve brands hasn't it ?
I like some of the tracksuits. But I don't think I am confident I can rock that look.
There is a third choice though between the three-piece suit to go to the pub(or the chase in the bad parts of town, really its that versatile) and the Chanel tracksuit when you go to the gym, after the kebab place. It is : the Chinese-Bond? I forgot the characters name but it was equally racially-sensitive and appropriate. Asian-007 ? Oriental-Brosnan ? Something like that. Anyway he opts for soft looking jackets with a simply a cashmere jumper or turtleneck underneath. It gives him a more agile look and younger apperance.On the culture side of things, it is 2020, so eveyrobdy is gay, wants to be gay, appears to be gay, hates to be gay and hates the gays. All at the same time.
Race relations? Yeah same thing. It is cool and bad to be black/chinese.
Whatever your position on these issues is, it will be in the movie. It will have no impact, because this is not trash re-heated 20 year garbage of a director who has become a parody of himself. No this is Art!
Oh and by the way Matthew McConaughey is Amercian, how quirky is that?P.S. : While writing about this I remembered the Hugh Grant dancing scene in Love Actually. I can only respect Hugh Grant in this movie to no play on his strenghs, and give us something absolutely no-one asked for, wanted, or even knew was possible. Bravo Sir! Bravo!",The Gentlemen

279,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,The Guy Ritchie Crime Caper Had its Time.,4,20 August 2020,"Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), an American expatriate, tries to sell off his highly profitable marijuana empire in London to American billionaire Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong). Things are complicated by Dry Eye (Henry Golding), a Chinese underboss who wants to take the weed business for himself and Fletcher (Hugh Grant), a private investigator who claims to have dirt on Pearson. The rivalry triggers plots, schemes, bribery, and blackmail from all sides in an attempt to steal Pearson's domain out from under him.After the release of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in the mid-nineties spawned a wave of crime comedies featuring an ensemble cast, snappy dialogue, and non-linear plot structure, such as Two Days In The Valley, The Boondock Saints, and Killing Zoe. Guy Ritchie was the most successful filmmaker to rise out of that wave with his first film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and quickly followed by its higher budgeted counterpart Snatch.In film school, Lock Stock was on everybody's top ten list and it was hip. The non-linear storytelling broke the mold and the witty dialogue (although realistically no gangster would ever speak in such a manner) felt fresh and entertaining onscreen. The comedy of errors between the bumbling gangsters and how they inadvertently ruin each other's plans was laugh-out-loud funny.Trying to engage with Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen was a flitting experience. The story keeps moving sideways instead of forward; it zigzags between its numerous gangsters who will spiel and pontificate about the gangster life and explaining the philosophy behind what they're doing as they're about to do it. One can't help to imagine whether if these gangsters would get more things done if they'd just pull the trigger instead of monologuing.Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant, Collin Farrell, and Henry Golding all deliver fine performances, trying very hard to add dimension their thin characters and make the stylized dialogue feel believable. The endless switching between characters undermines all the performances. It's hard to tell who you should be rooting for and at times, as if I was going crosseyed, all the characters blend into being the same Guy Ritchie gangster.The unreliable narration device, in the form of a conversation between Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam, is meant to add humor and suspense but ends up completely sucking the life out of the entire story because the story is completely told to the audience by two people in a living room. There's no narrative purpose to the unreliable narration because it is not developing the character or presenting their mindset like for Harley Quinn in Birds of Prey or Edward Norton in Fight Club. It just presents an event on what the two narrators are speculating happened and then the film reveals what really happened in a ""just kidding"" type way. A fan edit would drastically improve the narrative just by removing all the unnecessary elements to its portentous structure.Guy Ritchie even goes to add an unnecessary meta-layer to the story. Hugh Grant's private investigator presents the dirt on Matthew McConaughey's gangster as a written screenplay, which allows for his blackmail to sound like a film pitch. This opens up conversations about film stock and editing, which makes the film even more pompous. There's also a The Man From U.N.C.L.E poster hanging in one of the gangster's offices.In the end, The Gentlemen ends up coming off as smug and obnoxious like it knows it is genius and ahead of its audience. The thing is, I have seen this movie before (4 times in fact) so it didn't outsmart me nor was it particularly funny. I sat through it wondering when things will finally take off but the plot never goes anywhere. The story played like Guy Ritchie was playing mad-libs with his usual crime comedy template.Contrary to most of the writers-directors' careers, Guy Ritchie is one of the rare examples of a director who fares better doing higher-budget franchise properties. His reinterpretation of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson as a bickering couple in steampunk London was fresh. Little stylistic touches like his use of slow-motion to show Sherlock Holmes's thinking up a plan right before doing it in real-time were creative. His penchant for high-energy frenetic cinematography enlivened the dance sequences in Aladdin.Possibly with the box office disappointment with King Arthur, perhaps Guy Ritchie felt like he needed to revisit his grassroots by making The Gentlemen.All in all, the Guy Ritchie crime comedy is finished. The well has been dry a decade ago with Rocknrolla. Ritchie should have stopped at its peak as he has said everything he had to say with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. I'd recommend people rewatch them instead.Facebook.com/OCinemaD/",The Gentlemen
280,lakishaferguson21,Enjoyed very much,7,7 June 2020,"Saw this only having seen 1 Ritchie film(the man from U.N.C.L.E) but I enjoyed these Gentlemen! Thought it was funny especially Hugh and Colin.

281,pcrprimer,Solid cast with exceptional dialogue and story arc,9,25 October 2020,"This is no doubt a guy Ritchie film. It's filled with sharp dialog, gangsters, London, and a multi faceted story. All the major leads, from Farrell's coach to Hunnam's character and Matthew McConaughey's character as ooze charisma. When each is on the screen, you can't help but be transfixed to see what they do next. The London slang further adds to the story. Great film, with excellent and unpredictable story",The Gentlemen

283,helenbassett,The Gentlemen Film Review - Guy Ritchie Directs Every Kind Of Stereotype With Matthew McConaughey The King Of The Jungle And You Play By His Rules,10,14 January 2020,"I have really enjoyed watching Guy Ritchie's recent movies including the varied bag of King Arthur, Aladdin and Man From Uncle. No one trick pony here. And his latest The Gentlemen, that he wrote, co-produced and directed was fantastic, even though it included every kind of stereotype. Still funny in our politically correct time! And said stereotypes looked like they were having a blast. Especially Matthew McConaughey's Mickey Pearson. Not your usual stereotype as a Rhodes Scholar from the wrong side of the tracks, but savvy enough to realise how easy it is to sell weed to posh students in their dreaming spires. And so begins his career and advancement up the social ladder to join the gentry himself.Of course in every (crime) business, there are falling outs, and we find the older and now very successful Mickey, taking 5 one day with a pint and a pickled egg. And from behind he gets his brains blown out. A big player in the London Underworld. Someone must really want him dead.Shifting the time frame around enters the entertaining Fletcher, Hugh Grant, and I guess working from his true life tabloid experience, while adding a bit of Michael Caine sauce to it. His Private Investigator Fletcher is working for the Daily Print's Editor Big Dave, ironically played by Eddie Marsan. Mickey slighted him one day and in revenge Fletcher has been employed to dig the dirt on him. And there's a lot of dirt. So now Fletcher brings it to Charlie Hunnam's Ray. Mickey's No 2 and well Fletcher spins quite the story. So entertaining he's even written a screenplay to go along with his investigation. Bush! And he's willing to sell it all to Mickey for £20million. And he loves Ray's patio barbecue. And it is terrific. Although I did wonder at one point what, or who! was being served.And now Guy Ritchie gets creative telling Fletcher's story. You see prior to the pint and pickled egg, Mickey has taken the decision to cash out of his underground drug business, and spend more time with his beloved wife Rosalind. Michelle Dockery having a ball, from Essex and type cast as the future Lady Rosalind.The film barrels along at a terrific rate, with a motley cast of the aforementioned stereotype gangsters, all preening and cock fighting to get their hands on Mickey's business. And Mickey has agreed a £400 million price tag. Yes it's that good a deal. And keeps the roof over the heads of the Upperclass in their stately homes of Britain. And so audacious. So much so that American Jewish business man Matthew Berger, played by the almost unrecognisable Jeremy Strong, is keen to get high on the marijuana profits himself, and he has the readies. You could say he wants his pound of flesh. But there's competition, or is it collusion, from the Chinese, or some Asian type!, James Bond himself. Henry Golding playing Dry Eye. And he's Ricensed to kill Fletcher suggests, as he continues his tale to the disbelieving Ray. Dry Eye actually wants in on the weed as his Uncle is a heroin drug lord and won't willingly retire. And then there's the black street boys with their Coach the hilarious Colin Farrell. We'll forgive his crime of fashion because he'll do a job or two to paper over his good but dim boys bad deeds. Pretty handy too in the end. In a David Cameron sort of way. But nothing like a David Cameron sort of way I hasten to add!And of course the Russians get a look in with Fletcher's story, having bought up London with their dirty money. But still loving parents sending their kids to our best public schools. (At a discount given they are all Charitable institutions saving tax, with all UK tax payers losing out.) But some of these new residents still have a hotline to their previous roles in the KGB. But here Fletcher may have over-egged the pickled egg, and his screenplay Bush may not be worth much in his hand.Yes Guy Ritchie has it all covered and how he brings it together is a sight to behold. Spinning the twisting story, and then rewinding to play it again with added testosterone, and plenty of guns, not much blood, and unintentional high speed drops. The language is fruity, with f's and c's, but you don't expect to mind your p's and q's in the criminal underworld. And if Guy Ritchie is auditioning for Bond, then that I have to see. How about him directing James Norton as the suave new Bond?Great fun.",The Gentlemen

287,PerryAtTheMovies,This film is perfection...,10,21 December 2020,"Initial Thoughts:
""The Gentlemen"" is a poetic and romanticized masterpiece. Watching both on a small screen with headphones and a medium sized screen with TV speakers. I'm still left in the limelight of this dance. From an all-star cast to gorgeous camerawork this film offers a complete film for two hours.I enjoyed the complete aspect of the story in the film being told as a story for a film. In this regard, a narration of events for the future consideration of a movie being put together in our fictional world. With the story being narrated and subsequently acted out through each other the jump between past and present is seamless, and quite enjoyable.The camerawork was beautiful in my eyes. The biggest example that made the camerawork enjoyable was as follows. When a character was on the left side of the table there was space to their front, our right, and when a character was on the right side of the table there was space to their front, our left. This gave the enjoyment of actually going back and forth the table of conversation. Some movies tend to place characters dead center thus making the conversation work, but not entirely enjoyable.Lastly, the ensemble was perfect. Even with high profile actors, some films fall short, but for me, not in this case. The chemistry worked well and each character was definitive in who they were and what they represented. No one felt out of place and the range of emotion was brought to a front in each and every scene.Overall:
This film will definitely be added to my ""Must Watch"" list of 2020*. Storyline, cinematography, and character/actor chemistry was spot-on from start to finish. Although riddled with swearing throughout. I found that it adds to the authenticity I believe is ""gangster"" England. If you can get past the large amount of use of the word c*** then I think you'll be fine.Enjoy the show!*I did some digging and although the premier was in 2019. ""The Gentlemen"" falls into the 2020 awards season, and therefore I'm classifying it as a 2020 film compared to the 2019 stat in IMDb.",The Gentlemen
288,x-54313,Excellent comedy,8,13 May 2020,"Guy Ritchie's editing aesthetics is already a creative model that is completely intertwined with the script. Photography may not be prominent, but the visual effects are getting harder and harder, and the dramatic conflicts become more severe. The film's black meaning is strong, the placement of the joke nodes is very systematic, there are many new ideas out of the wrong knot. The casting was excellent and the actors played well",The Gentlemen

290,kismit,Glad to see he's back,9,3 February 2020,"To me Ritchie's films have been inching downward since Lock Stock. This one isn't as innovative of course but tells its story well and helps one forget King Arthur. I loved the casting, particularly Henry Golding and Hugh Grant. Golding's charismatic villain almost steals the show.
My only complaint might be Lord George could have been fleshed out a little better. Lock Stock and Snatch had multiple antagonists and this seemed like a missed opportunity. Seeing behind the villain's door adds depth to the story.",The Gentlemen
291,jaycop,Another Classic Ritchie Film,9,19 April 2020,It's a good year when Guy Ritchie drops a movie.. this is one his best films so screw the critics. The cast is excellent and storyline is classic Ritchie.,The Gentlemen
292,adeckofcards,Criminal. Class.,7,28 August 2020,"Director Guy Ritchie rose to fame as quickly as he lost his way. During his early years he gained great popularity for his stylized Gangster tapes, but over the years he lost a bit of the tone that characterized him at first.
With 'The Gentlemen', Guy Ritchie intends to go back to his beginnings and give this film with a low budget a unique mark, something that he undoubtedly manages to achieve, although at a slow pace.
The story tells of the criminal life of different Gangsters in different social and criminal strata. It could easily be just another Gangster movie as there are better ones, however the way Ritchie stages this story and its characters is the film's true achievement. It is true that it is difficult to connect with the story in the beginning, perhaps because of the speed of the assembly or dialogue, but approaching the middle of the film it is inevitable to be fascinated by Ritchie's style, his way of narrating and the simple but smart you walk into without any problem waiting for the next move from the filmmaker.
This is how this film could be a rare mix between Scorsese's Gangster cinema and Tarantino's memorable dialogue, both of which come together in a film that results in the pure and enjoyable Guy Ritchie style.",The Gentlemen
293,rayres0708,Guy Ritchie does it again,9,17 April 2020,"This movie is everything you expect and want from a Guy Ritchie film. It's funny, well-paced, full of great actors, and executed perfectly.

294,Jackblyth8,A Guy Ritchie Classic,10,28 January 2021,"Guy Ritchie supplies is with another exhilarating watch, the polished screenplay entails an impressive cast, all playing there part in a story of uncertainty. The plot begins with Big Dave, editor of the Daily Print tabloid, snubbed by cannabis baron Mickey Pearson, played by Matthew McConaughey, at a party and hires private investigator Fletcher, mastered by Hugh Grant, to investigate Pearson's links to Lord Pressfield, a Royal Duke with a heroin-addicted daughter. Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled 'Bush') to Pearson's right-hand man, Raymond, for £20,000,000. Instantly confronted with a quality cast, Charlie Hunnam performs as an intimidating, tough figure standing loyal to Pearson, who's best known for his rebellious behaviour and greed for profit. The film is told as a story by Grant's character, with all other events in the past, his mysteriously slow speech adds a chilling sense to the feature, and his confidence in his investigation is rather smug. Pearson plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger for £400,000,000 so he can retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind. Pearson introduces Berger to one of his labs where he grows his cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords, who need cash for the upkeep of their stately homes. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye, an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is then raided by amateur MMA fighters and aspiring YouTubers ""The Toddlers"" who overpower the lab's guards, steal a van-load of marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters' trainer, known only as Coach, orders them to delete the video and is horrified when he discovers that the cannabis belongs to Pearson. As Fletcher's explanation speeds up, the tale experiences a transition, a turn of events from the comforting, successful life of Mickey Pearson. The Coach, played expertly by Colin Farrell, possesses a thick Irish accent and proves his ability when single handedly beating up a group of teenagers in a cafe. Dry Eye, played by Henry Golding, is brutal in his want to achieve the maximum in the drug business, informing to Mickey that the young will replace the old. Pearson begins transferring his cannabis plants out of the estates. He also agrees to bring home Pressfield's wayward daughter Laura. Raymond retrieves Laura from a council estate where she is living with several other addicts. However, in a brawl with her flatmates one of Raymond's men accidentally pushes Aslan, a young Russian man, out of the window to his death. Although Laura was then returned to her parents, she later dies of a heroin overdose, found in an emotional scene by her grieving parents. Coach visits Raymond, apologises for his student's actions, and offers his services as penance. Coach has captured Phuc, a henchman of Dry Eye's who had informed Coach's crew about the lab location, although Phuc is accidentally killed during a botched escape attempt. Pearson threatens Lord George for going after his lab, and in retaliation, destroys one of his heroin labs. George chastises Dry Eye for his insubordination in attacking Pearson and offering to buy him out; George nods to a henchman to execute Dry Eye, but the man executes George instead. Dry Eye's manipulation is clear and his plan to become a drug kingpin is something he is close to achieving. Henry Golding doesn't usually play the menacing, merciless sinner, but engages convincingly. It is worth noting that as viewers we can't help but admire Coach, his sense of humour, cool nature and will to change ""The Toddlers"" into good people, his role is critically underrated. Unknown to Pearson, Dry Eye is in league with Berger, who had wanted Pearson's business disrupted to reduce the price. Dry Eye has taken Lord George's place and still hopes to take Pearson's empire for himself. Dry Eye tries to kidnap Rosalind, who kills Dry Eye's men before she run out of bullets in her two-shot derringer. Raymond kills an assassin sent to kill Pearson; the two rush to Rosalind and Pearson kills Dry Eye. Fletcher ends his story and Raymond orders him to leave his house. Fletcher's overall characterisation is ghostly, his conceited tone manifests his omniscience, surprised that Raymond sees out the story, we suggest there is still another chain of events to be released. Fletcher has merely confirmed Pearson's suspicions about the link between Dry Eye and Berger. Raymond orders Coach's students to capture Big Dave. They drug him and film him having sex with a pig, threatening to post it online unless he drops his investigation. Pearson and Berger meet up again in a frozen fish plant, actually a cover for Pearson's European distribution operation. Berger drops his offer to $130,000,000, on account of the recent disruptions it had experienced, but Pearson reveals his knowledge of Berger's plan, shows him Dry Eye's frozen body and tells him he is keeping his business. Pearson forces Berger inside a freezer, where he will freeze to death unless he transfers $270,000,000 compensation and, for the assault on Rosalind, cuts ""a pound of flesh"" from his own body. As the film comes to a conclusion, McConaughey's character shows heroic actions in saving his wife and confronting Berger, his portrayal across the film as a whole is proficient, encapsulating the courage required to complete and finish his business. Fletcher, once again, approaches Raymond for his payment, but Raymond reveals that he was tailing Fletcher all along. The fighters have stolen his stashes of evidence after Raymond placed a tracker inside his shoe during their last encounter. Fletcher reveals that he has also sold information to Aslan's father, a Russian oligarch and former KGB agent. Coach kills the two Russian triggermen sent to kill Raymond, while Fletcher escapes in the chaos. Pearson is kidnapped by two other Russians, but they are ambushed by Coach's students who want to ""solve Coach's problem"". They assault the car with bullets, killing the Russians and allowing Pearson to escape. Later, Fletcher decides to pitch the story as a film to Miramax. After his meeting, he gets into a taxi only to realise that Raymond is the driver. Upon learning of Fletcher's capture, Pearson and Rosalind return to their cannabis empire and celebrate in each other's company. Director Guy Ritchie once said that he got into film-making because he was interested in making entertaining movies, who he felt there was a lack of, 'The Gentleman' is nothing short of entertaining. The process of telling the story through the viewpoint of Fletcher is magnificent. The film itself, lasting for 113 minutes, supplies fine acting, laugh-out-load one liners, and breathtaking action. The story is a chain of events, with one feature setting off another etc. The constant blackmail and schemes to undermine Mickey Pearson emphasise the seriousness of the drug business and how every figure is tied into the profession in some way. In the same spirit as Ritchie's kLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch', 'The Gentleman' grossed a total of $115 million in all territories. The already successful hit was critically noted for its racist undertones and coarse language, however, the excellent screenplay is positively seen as a welcome return to form for Ritchie.

Hugh Grant in this was amazing, his quirky homosexual character had me dying! Like there is dialogue in this film between characters where the humor and wittiness just just doesn't stop, it's exhausting and at points I was to nervous to drink anything out of fear i may choke. The story is fantastic, the dialogue is great, and the film is surprisingly non complicated if you simply pay close attention, but it's genuinely easy to follow. I highly recommend, Guy Ritchie can be a genius. Great acting all round. At points it can feel a bit ridiculous., but it's not meant to be taken seriously sometimes. It's a fun film, and just very original. May offend some, the constant use of the word c#@t made a woman close to me tut throughout. Amazing characters, loved everything about it.

American actors were forced to speak with some tight-lipped British accent. The stupid beginning already exposed a predictable one-way developed direction. The blah, blah and blah never stimulated your further interest to keep your focus, just a bunch of guys in suits, coats, windbreakers cursed in British accent trying to give you an authentic British product.Well, this is definitely not ""Dallas Buyers Club"", nor any other interesting drug war movie.

I'm glad we did, because I really (and rather unexpectedly) liked it a lot. It was much more entertaining than I thought Guy Ritchie capable of (or that he showed in ""King Arthur"").

There is no substitute for Vinnie Jones, who is the rare kind of actor who can make menacing also funny. So many of these devices were used that i felt no suspense nor caught on to any real plot.

323,Otuoacheampong97,Intelligent Clever and Objective,7,29 April 2020,"The Gentlemen is the one of the few best crime comedy films ever to be released. This film is directed by Guy Ritchie and distributed by SFX films. The film stars renowed actors including Matthew McConaughey and Guy Ritchie himself. The film was produced with a budget of $22 million and has grossed $110 million at the box so far.
The plot of the film follows Micheal Pearson played by Matthew McConaughey, a wealthy businessman who is been investigated by Big Dave, played by Guy Ritchie.
Micheal Pearson is a marijuana kingpin who seeks to sell his business. Big Dave is an editor for the Daily print, a private investigation news outlet. The two clashed at a party but first time acquintance did not go well as Pearson refuses to shake hands with Big Dave. This gesture evoked the inqusitive spirit of Big Dave. He hires Fletcher, a private investigator to investigate Micheal Pearson's amicable relationship with Lord Pressfield, a royal duke with an addicted missing daughter. This brings Flecther in contact with Ray, Pearson's right-hand man. Fletcher's investigation reveals the dark side of marijauna business where vicious activities abound.
The film is racially balanced, giving it a warm global reception. The involment of Chinese mafia and gangs excited me. What I witnessed from this film is that, the East sees the drug business as a family legacy while the Western world sees it a an individual pathway to success. Fletcher's performance is fantastic. He was able to carry his investigation in a friendly and cleverly tone. The amicable connection between him and Ray spinned the film to its critical acclaims. Both parties were intelligent and objective. I really liked the calmness and timely eruptions of Ray's mannerisms.
I have a strong feeling that this film will go down as one of the best Guy Ritchie's moments.
I can bet my last coin on this film to be on any list of best original screenplays. Tis' a must watch film, what are you waiting for?",The Gentlemen
324,Her-Excellency,"For THE film to watch and THE tracksuits to wear in 2020, look no further than The Gentlemen",9,27 March 2020,"In Love Actually, Hugh Grant, who coincidentally also lends his acting talents to The Gentlemen, tells a group of reporters: ""We may be a small country, but we're a great one too. (The) Country of Shakespeare, Churchill, The Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter, David Beckham's right foot ... David Beckham's left foot come to think of it.""Well, in my opinion, he forgot to mention Guy Ritchie, who is known for his gangster films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000) among others, as well as the Sherlock Holmes' films of 2009 and 2011. With The Gentlemen, Guy Ritchie goes one step further in proving himself a national treasure of our friends the Brits.With the help of a cast comprised of big names and lovable favorites such as Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant and the inimitable Colin Farrell, as well as an intelligent, engaging and entertaining script, Guy Ritchie once again comes through in delivering sumptuous fare for the eyes and ears and heart. Here, Mickey Pearson (McConaughey), is a powerful American marijuana dealer based in England whose plan it is to retire and sell off his marijuana empire for a cool £400 Million to spend more time with his wife. As can be expected, more than a wrench is thrown into his plan. What ensues, is giddy entertainment a'la Chef Ritchie's Specialty of witty, super-fast, intelligent, humorous exchanges and more than a few sleights-of-hand by a gallery of engaging and colorful characters who are thrown into numerous subplots, countless twists and turns, betrayals, confrontations and several inevitable revelations.Sounds confusing 'duneh it'? It isn't.Sit back and enjoy the rich mischievousness with which this is all served and rest assured that Ritchie is a master. With a deft and artful hand and sure command of his narrative threads, he has fun rearranging the linearity of the story (which if attempted by anyone else might be confusing), and delivers something close to a masterpiece.8.7/10",The Gentlemen
325,Bek204,A funny movie filled with a bit of action and plot twists,7,19 July 2020,"I'm very glad that I watched ""The Gentlemen"", Guy Ritchie returns to another incredible movie.The first 40 minutes of the movie were so freakin boring and I was lost, felt like there was confusion or chaos in the story, I couldn't understand anything and there was NOTHING AT ALL that grabbed my attention, but after that, the movie starts to have some events that grabbed my attention this time and they made me excited for what's coming next.Loved the ""Narration Style"" (Idk if that's the perfect word to describe it) of the movie, and how the movie starts off with Fletcher (Played by Hugh Grant) telling a little story but then we realize that it wasn't just a little story it's actually a long story and it's actually the story of the whole movie.The action scenes in the movie were very cool but they were very few and they were weak by that I mean I didn't ""FEEL"" the action and one thing that I really noticed is that ""comedy"" was taking over ""action"", but of course the few action scenes were so cool and I really enjoyed them.Really loved the ""little"" plot twists that were in the movie and unfortunately, I can't talk about them or I'll spoil everything.The characters were LIT and that's thanks to the cast of course. Coach (Played by Collin Farrell) was my favorite character in the whole movie, Ray (played by Charlie Hunnam) was amazing, Fletcher (played by Hugh Grant) was also amazing, the charisma of each character is the thing that really saved the long conversations or maybe the whole movie, to be honest, and without it, these conversations would've been boring as hell and the movie was gonna be dead.Really loved the production design that really suited the environment and the characters, also the custom designs were pretty cool and fancy exactly like they should be.Now for Mickey Pearson (Played by Matthew McConaughey ), I wish if we could have seen him more in the movie, felt like he didn't have much of a role or something, he was just the ""BOSS"" that has his guys to do everything for him and to be honest it makes sense he's the guy who built the highly profitable marijuana empire so of course, he's just gonna have his guys do everything for him, they even call him ""BOSS"" the whole movie, but I still wanted to see more of Mickey Pearson or to be specific, I wanted to see more of Matthew McConaughey.Although all the characters in the movie were ""BAD CHARACTERS"", we still really loved them that's a thing that I loved about the movie.
Felt like there were some characters that weren't even important in the whole movie or they didn't have much impact in the story and one of them is: Dry Eye (Played by Henry Golding), although his acting was okay, his character was a waste of time.The Gentlemen is a very funny and interesting movie, filled with a bit of action that you'll enjoy, really recommend this fun movie.My rating is: 7.5/10",The Gentlemen

Absolutely perfect Matthew (i cant write his surname correctly) , but for me the best man was charlie (i cant write his surname correctly).

Fast edits, narrative overlay in slow motion, punchy dialogue with multiple storylines, and this film does the usual. In some ways its directing style detracts from the film as a whole. Static camera, actors on their marks, quick shots, twenty cuts, fast speaking, and Ritchie letting you know you are watching a Ritchie film. But I still like it.And the reason was Hugh and Colin.

Matthew McConaughey can play a bad ass, when he loses it.The bad stuff. Hugh Grant, you one dimensional squirrel, you sound like Micky blue eyes, but trying, bah its bad.
Same with Hunnam, but he's forgiven for better acting than Grant.Story is basically Lock Stock and Snatch, not as funny and not as well acted. But if you like those, you can't go wrong, it's a solid film and you won't feel like you wasted a couple of hours.",The Gentlemen

338,Vishal_s_kumar,The Gentlemen is classy!!!,9,29 January 2020,"It's been a long time since Guy Ritchie has made something that's distinctly his own. He's spent the last decade chasing blockbusters, trying to turn himself into a mega-director the studios love to employ, only to receive a few kicks in the teeth (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword) and one lucky break from basically a sure thing (Aladdin remake). Initially making a name for himself with gangster cinema, Ritchie returns to form with ""The Gentlemen,"" which examines criminal conduct and games of intimidation from a community of bosses, lowlifes, and outsiders. Ritchie isn't taking a tremendous creative gamble with the movie, but it feels like a man flushing the gunk out of his system, returning to his favourite genre to find his violent English playfulness again, which he hasn't been near since 2008's ""Rock'n'Rolla.""
Fletcher (High Grant) is a sleazy reporter for a British tabloid who's in possession of information that will be of use to Raymond (Charlie Hunnam), employed as a right-hand man for Mickey (Matthew McConaughey), who runs a drug empire with his wife, Rosalind (Michelle Dockery). Eager to collect a fortune for his knowledge, Fletcher shares his concern about a deal Mickey is negotiating with Matthew (Jeremy Strong), ready to sell his marijuana business to a fellow American for 400 million dollars. Trouble is, the secret enterprise has been comprised by Dry Eye (Henry Golding), a small-time stooge trying to purchase Mickey's business for a considerably lower amount, while Coach (Colin Farrell) discovers his boxing students have infiltrated one of Mickey's weed lairs to make a rap video. Fletcher has witnessed this mess from afar, attempting to inspire Raymond to buy his silence, but the gangster is not impressed, listening to the reporter weave together fact and fiction as the future of Mickey's holdings falls into flux.
In line with Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch,"" ""The Gentlemen"" brings the helmer back to the basics in terms of underworld storytelling interests. It's a tale of corrupt figures navigating a disruption to their daily business, with Mickey the central figure of crisis here. He's a smooth operator in fancy suits, sucking on a cigar, overseeing a kingdom of marijuana he runs in the English countryside, paying estate owners a fortune to grow weed underground. That alone is an enticing tale, building on the crumbling realities of ""Downton Abbey"" as Mickey provides cash flow to castle owners unable to pay for massive repairs, allowing them to continue projecting power. However, this is a Guy Ritchie movie, and simplicity of threat isn't of interest to the filmmaker, who quickly complicates a dangerous situation with fresh characters and problems, as everyone is coming after Mickey's marijuana factory in one way or another.
""The Gentlemen"" uses Fletcher's manipulation as a way into the story, with the reporter requesting a moment with Raymond in the man's luxury apartment, presenting his version (a ""cinematic journey"") of Mickey's woes to collect a fortune for himself. The screenplay delivers a mighty collision of opportunism and limited patience, generating an intellectual fencing match of sorts between Fletcher and Raymond. The rest of ""The Gentlemen"" explores the narrative up to this point, with Fletcher sharing his information about Mickey's holdings and the plans of Matthew, who's not interested in paying an extraordinary sum of money for the weed farms, while Dry Eye goes against gang interests by making a bid of his own. Coach is the bystander pulled into this dangerous orbit, blessed with his own criminal backstory to keep bad elements away from him and his boxers. The stew thickens throughout the picture, finding trust eroding among the players, which results in the occasional chase and burst of violence.
Ritchie doesn't go wild with ""The Gentlemen,"" which is largely a psychological game between arrogant and scheming men who enjoy the thrill of the hunt and possess a huge fondness for the C-word. It's tightly edited and enormously entertaining, watching a handful of decent actors become great during the run time, with Hunnam, Farrell, and McConaughey contributing some of their finest efforts in the picture, focused on remaining in sync with the director's vision for twisty language and turns of plot. Dockery is a joy as well, portraying a ""Cockney Cleopatra,"" while Grant steals the movie, clearly relishing a chance to portray a tabloid sleazebag. They're pawns in Ritchie's big screen chess game, which delivers on betrayals, heated confrontations, and bruising banter. ""The Gentlemen"" is incredibly fun, restoring some faith in Ritchie's abilities to do what he does best, which is to throw a festival of bad choices from rotten characters with iffy survival instincts.",The Gentlemen

It has to be at least entertaining!And I wasn't wrong.This has the noticeable husk of Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, but it lacks much of the charm and the style that make up Ritchie's earlier, more rambunctious outings.The script is fairly tight, and the story is just interesting enough to maintain tension and wonder.Still, that signature Guy-Ritchie mind-bending flair is absent here, leaving only competent filmmaking in its wake.What's left is a fun crime romp with a focus on non-linear storytelling and top-notch acting.It's well worth a watch, but don't expect Snatch.7.5/10",The Gentlemen

A good start to bringing hollywood standards back up. Same with anything Jordan Peele makes.,The Gentlemen
346,iamianiman,"Suit up, The Gentlemen balances both style & substance like beauty with brain.",7,18 February 2020,"Once in a while comes a movie that centres on a violent crime caper that will either make it or break it. Guy Ritchie's gangster-comedy, The Gentlemen is one that is entertaining as hell though it asks viewers to carry the load much higher than most of other commercial movies because Ritchie's style of providing information is skilled like a sharp shooter person.The Gentlemen unbuckles its load by telling the whole narrative with a real sense of maturity. There is an impalpable weight the audience has to carry during the two hours but the lumbersome feels as if it was afloat in a suction of vacuum because the narrative would keep you intrigued to the very end. The story is told in a uniquely satirical way that would unquestionably amuse viewers who would consider themselves as cinephiles. What wonders us is Ritchie is able to mix the satirical ingredient into the rich storytelling perfectly just like the prince who found out that Cinderella's feet is the most fitting for the sparkling silver high heels. However, the film bounces back and forth which is not easy to follow but as long as your mind does not detract from the real deal, you are along for the ride.With the title suggests a group of classical men, the actors' performance/character is the essence of the film. McConaughey's Mickey is boosted with the oh-so-handsome charisma that not only is indispensable for the narrative, but would also drool your girlfriend. Charlie Hunnam is brilliant as always, this extremely underrated actor proves that he's always got something to offer which The Gentlemen has provided ample time for him to rival against those who have the audacity to look away his talents. Fletcher, played by Hugh Grant is the main storyteller here, giving the audience directions for what's about to come while doing his best Cockney accent. Jeremy Strong as Matthew is in his name, a strong contender. This will probably be his breakthrough career in the industry. Farrell plays Coach, he is great portraying a cocky head slash boxing trainer with a handful of minions to hang around with. The only female here is Dockery as Mickey's beloved wife who acts in full shrewd and confident. Everyone is remarkable here except for one, Henry Golding. His character is not a memorable villain and the offering gets worse with his acting. With his irritating perennial lips movements like a sided-O everytime he talks in every movie added on top of his try-hard expression, he is perhaps the weakest link of the movie.An exciting part to talk about in this kind of films would be the action set pieces unfortunately, The Gentlemen does not offer much. With those that is familiar with Ritchie's past works (not Aladdin sorry), he is capable to entertain audience with frenetic action and violence. In his latest work, Ritchie's fans may be disappointed to see that the only actions lying around is assassination through targeted shootings. Not to mention that they are always served with repetitive style of negotiations before the action takes place, making it seems as if the movie barely has any at all.Which brings us to this part where the most exceptional thing is the outmaneuvering of one another to stay one step ahead of the opponent. Even greater when there are hilarious jokes to ice the ever-thicken plot as time runs out. It feels like a game of cat-and-mouse but it reveals itself in subtlety, thanks to the matured storytelling. The 'who is who' would keep you entertained 'till the end.First look on the poster and you'll see Kingsman. Second look and you'll probably say, this is a disguise to a Kingsman sequel. By the third look, everyone is already speculating the same thing like a link of wired brains. Ladies and gents, hold my beer. As shocking as it may sound, this is nothing like Kingsman. Nothing! From the storytelling, the action scenes down to the universe and its type of humours. Unless if you consider the costume design and some of the locations, then yes. In comparison, The Gentlemen makes Kingsman looks like child's play.For those looking forward on the costume design, you are in for a luck. Michael Wilkinson surely knows how to distinguish each character with each classic look. From the hair styles to the leather boots, he nails it! Not only The Gentlemen, but also Dockery as Rosalind is a charm beauty wearing that thick blazer suited with 1.5 inch circumference of golden-coloured buttons.Ritchie offers a movie about the men without focusing on the 'woke' subject nor does he care about being politically motivated. If one should care, then The Gentlemen provides the opposite of supporting the men... nor the women. It contains strong language that is offensive, racist and homophobic. Not to mention a gross sequence inspired by the debut episode of Black Mirror that is disturbing but deliberately hilarious.Verdict: Guy Ritchie proves again he is able to create an authentic storytelling, for those who are fans of his works would be pleased to follow the train. The Gentlemen is a work of art targeted for matured adults but not necessarily only for men and of which it has potential to be nominated for Best Costume Design & Best Screenplay at the grand awards early 2021!",The Gentlemen

349,michaeldoud,"First Hit: A few scenes were to fun watch, but as a film, it was poorly constructed.",4,27 January 2020,"First Hit: A few scenes were to fun watch, but as a film, it was poorly constructed.I've never seen a Guy Ritchie film that I thought was constructed with thoughtfulness and skill. He either attempts to cover too much ground or is more inclined to use pop and dazzle to engage the audience.In this film, he has to use narration throughout to create, set up, and deliver the story. He hides his inability to write a good screenplay by making the narration of his story part of the storyline his characters say to each other.Specifically, watch most of the scenes between a dirt-digger detective and reporter Fletcher (Hugh Grant and Ray (Charlie Hunnam). Ray is the right-hand man and consigliere for Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), the weed lord of England. Because Fletcher is attempting to blackmail Mickey and Ray, he explains the whole story to the theater's audience by reading the screenplay with Ray.This is the main issue with this film. Having to rely on this narration to provide a lot of the movie's context is troubling. However, I will say the way it is done here is better than having an unknown voice over-explanation.The story as I saw it, was that Mickey wants to sell his vast marijuana growing and distribution empire to Matthew (Jeremy Strong). The reason for selling was unclear and unconvincing. Matthew is a wealthy eccentric Englishman who is intrigued with the possibility of buying this empire for $400M. However, it is a lot of money, and to drive the price down, Matthew engages ""Dry Eye"" (Henry Golding and a term used for Asians). Dry Eye makes an offer that Mickey scoffs at, but because the offer to sell to Matthew was supposed to be secret, Mickey is now on guard.Then the story adds complexity because we learn that Matthew and Dry Eye are working some sort of side deal to assist each other in reducing the price, but each plans to screw the other as well.Adding to this is Fletcher, who, through his detective work, documents all the goings-on between all the parties, which led to the script he reads from. His hopes are to sell the screenplay to Mickey and Ray for $20M so that Mickey and Ray will know all the subversive planning that is going on to drive the price down.The most fun part of the film is when we have scenes with Coach (Colin Farrell). His group of boys is caught raising havoc in one of Mickey's underground farms, so he owes Mickey and Ray. The payback to Ray and Mickey are amusing and fun to watch.Confused? One could be, but this convoluted story is kept on track by the narration scenes. This saves the film from being a total disaster and it also makes it a poorly constructed film.Anyway, there are lots of side plots and stories in this movie, including Mickey's wife, Rosalind Pearson (Michelle Dockery). She's supposed to be the most magnificent woman in the world, but it is only in the eyes of the beholder. There is the newspaper owner who hired Fletcher. There is Lord George (Tom Wu), head dragon, heroin distributor who crosses Mickey.The movie has lots of twists that are used for creating interest and complexity, and in some cases, it works, but mostly it doesn't.McConaughey's role in this makes me wonder. At times he selects fantastic parts like in film Dallas Buyer's Club and other times, he chooses roles like this one. He does it well enough, but it's really a role of false, blustery, and cool-man behavior. Hunnam is outstanding as Ray, Mickey's right-hand man. Grant is oddly compelling as a bad guy. I've not seen him recently, and seeing him here was fun. Farrell is brilliant as the Coach of a group of guys and honest to his word. Actually, I liked his character and role the best of all. Dockery is okay as Mickey's wife and auto builder entrepreneur. Strong is mediocre as the wealthy and odd Englishman who wants to buy Mickey's empire. Golding is formidable as Dry Eye, a youngish Asian who wants to make his mark. Wu was perfect as the wry old heroin distributor. Ritchie wrote and directed this film, and as I've indicated, Guy has little to offer in the realm of filmmaking and his background in music videos is where his talent may lay.Overall: Although entertaining at times, being so convoluted the required narration means the story and film needs additional work.",The Gentlemen

353,gabriel-80,Great fun!,9,23 February 2020,"First off, the acting is superb. Hugh Grant steals the show. Every character is memorable and the story is unpredictable, funny and intelligent. Guy Ritchie at his best. This is what cinema is meant to be. Highly recommended.",The Gentlemen
354,northernpaladin,Same old same old,5,25 February 2021,"Someone needs to tell Guy Ritchie just to stop, we're bored now. He's not in touch with the east end or has any insight to offer us about criminals he's just a luvvie behind a camera who tapped a rich vein but that vein has gone. This rag bag of all the Ritchie tropes; jump cut, montage framing, story within a story, quirky characters and an end which isn't an end have all been done before and better.
Most of the story is told via a two hander narrator and audience device comprising Grant (who has great fun with the role of slimy journalist) and Hunnam makes the audience role work. The narration revolves around McConaughey as the ex pat yank running a large scale marijuana business in the UK which he wants to sell up and retire from, shades of Layer Cake which tells the story a whole lot better, and this is the first problem. Now McConaughey is fine actor who was obviously hired with an eye to the US market and his ability to display a lethal charm but the conceit to make this work; failed Rhodes Scholar who finds he has a talent for dealing weed to the toffs, is just too much of a stretch, not helped by McConaughey basically sleep walking through the film.
In the course of the film we meet his Jewish, fey, buyer, played so badly by Jeremy Strong, who naturally tries to put one over on McConaughey, with the assistance of an up coming Hong Kong gangster and comic boxing gym assortment gang of east end stereotypes. Cue overt and covert racist and anti semitic 'jokes' which are pretty tasteless and don't advance the plot.
Included in the mix are a stereotype wannabe uncultured newspaper proprietor, played terribly by Eddie Marsan - why do film makers still hire this bloke? Who wants to bring down McConaughey for the flimsyest of reasons and is the notional employer of Grant. Also McConaughey's wife running a posh car business, an utter waste of Dockery's talents, a missing heiress and of course a Russian ogligarch and his ex KGB henchmen (30 years ago Guy).
Suffice to say there are mix ups, we are miss directed, there are bodies, there is dark humour but it never really adds up to much, mainly because the idea of a charming yank convincing his posh uni customers who now own stately homes on acres of ground they can't afford to turn a blind eye to his underground cannabis farms on his land is utterly ludicrous.
The one bright spot is Colin Farrell as the gym owner with a past who is excellent in every scene he steals.
Can some enjoyment be had? Well obviously yes but in no way is this a 10 or 9 rating and those who would put such a rating up need to take a look at themselves. This is a bang average piece of work which is 30 minutes too long.has",The Gentlemen
355,TimMeade,"Familiar Territory, but Guy Ritchie in Best Form",8,2 January 2020,"In all Guy Ritchie's crime caper movies there is, perhaps, an amorality and glorification of violence which ordinarily I would find unedifying. But only once, in the morally bankrupt RocknRolla, did this ruin the film and have me booing, metaphorically, at the end; his undoubted talent as a filmmaker has glossed over these shortcomings on all other occasions.The Gentlemen is the latest in the series, written and directed by Mr Ritchie. Matthew McConaughey plays drug lord Mickey Pearson who is looking to sell his British interests, attracting the attention of other underworld figures keen to inherit his thriving empire.Guy Ritchie's sharp direction and non-lateral storytelling are on top form. The script is crisp and witty, the continual plot twists keep you on your toes. If you feel some of the Mockney dialogue is a little bombastic, well, it'd be like going to watch a Carry On film and then complaining about double entendres - over the top dialogue is what he does; it's his trademark. And his homage to The Long Good Friday is a nice touch and contains a further surprise.Most of the cast are also on top form, clearly enjoying themselves. Special mention to Hugh Grant playing a seedily odious private investigator-cum-blackmailer. His portrayal is something of a meta joke, channelling his hatred of the British tabloid hacks who have famously pursued the illegal tactics which his character practices. Perhaps the only failure is Henry Golding, in his first role outside rom-com, not quite convincing as a would-be Pablo Escobar. And it's a shame the excellent Colin Farrell's role isn't beefed up more. But these are mere quibbles.The Gentlemen is a fast paced and laugh out loud action movie, an enjoyable holiday treat for adults.",The Gentlemen

357,CtlAltDel,Disappointing,5,3 August 2020,10 out 10? Seriously? I like Guy Ritchie's theatrical style of filmmaking which works so well the Sherlock Holmes franchise. And it was fun watching Hugh Grant in an atypical role. The whole premise of the film has us following the story through exposition. BUT I think after awhile it just became tedious. The were a few mild chuckles but nothing uproariously funny for a black comedy. Eventually I just got bored and if I hadn't paid to rent it online I would have turned it off.

358,smithpaulusmc,Near Perfection,9,19 December 2020,"Guy Ritchie is one of those directors who makes my head tingle when I hear that he has a new movie coming to town. As soon as I hear his name, I immediately begin to imagine what new spattering of crime, English charm (and repulsiveness), violence, and asynchronous storytelling that will only become clear as the credits begin to roll... I will witness in theaters or at home. Ritchie's newest offering, The Gentleman, does not disappoint.The Gentleman invites a new twist this time around, placing an American in the starring role. Matthew McConaughey leads an all-star cast of action adventurists and comics, including Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell, Eddie Marsan, and Henry Golding, through a winding story of deception, violence, and backstabbing all in the name of business. McConaughey plays Michael Pearson, an American former Rhodes Scholar who capitalized on his uncanny ability to produce and sell white widow cheese (that's marijuana for those of us less educated botanists) and is now on the verge of retirement. As Michael Pearson moves to sell his operation to businessman Matthew (Jeremy Strong), Pearson's world begins to unravel in a complex tale that leaves you rooting for the heroes who would be considered villains in a court of law.Ritchie's film is a masterclass in screenwriting. The entirety of the story comes tightly packed as a screenplay within a screenplay, allowing opportunist Fletcher (Hugh Grant) to reveal the plot to Pearson's top gunman Ray (Charlie Hunnam) outside of tie and space.Nearly every breathing second of the film is full of A+ soundtrack, action, comedy, and unexpected twists.

It was really interesting going through how Micky made his empire & where all his farms are hidden amongst the UK countryside, all the set up required & all the necessary people to keep it going, the film portrays this throughout the film.Defiantly give this film a chance if you are not sure, even if you think its just talking, it is NOT.Age - 25

And Michelle Dockery was my crush all the movie. I think it was an excellent casting decision to give her this role. Her character shows brilliantly that you can present a powerful, smart, beautiful, likable, brave and badass woman without all the ridiculous woke stuff of the late Hollywood.If you enjoyed Snatch, Rocknrolla and two smocking barrels, please, stop now what you are doing and run to the movie theater. This movie is great and it will be a cult classic. And in the final credits, wait for the music video.",The Gentlemen

395,Don_Falone1985,Back to form Guy Ritchie,9,24 September 2020,"Honestly outstanding from Guy Ritchie. I just wish he stuck with this type genre because he's an absolute genius at these type of movies. When he goes off track and starts directing a different sort of movie, his films are nowhere near as strong. This is by far his best movie since the magnificent Snatch and Lock Stock. I believe Snatch is still his masterpiece and his best film along with Lock stock. This comes a close 3rd behind these 2. It's you're typical 1 liner cockney gangster comedy with superb witty dialogue in true Ritchie fashion. If are you not British, notably a Londoner, you will find it hard to understand certain phrases and the terminology, but don't let it put you off. Shove the sub titles on if you find it a little difficult to follow. That being said, the usual interweaved story that climaxes to a superb conclusion like every other similar Ritchie film is apparent and a brilliant cast is on the menu throughout. Hugh Grant the pick of the lot, playing a sleaze ball called Fletcher, who seems to have dirt on everyone ;) I won't spoil the story of the film, but I will certainly be recommending anyone to watch this fantastic British crime comedy, that's worth the 2 hours of your life. Don't miss out, superb movie.",The Gentlemen

Turns out when I went to write it, people had already written that... and that's actually a good thing, after all there are more people around that agree Guy is doing great well-acted, paced, full of humour crime movies again!

The Gentlement is a great shot of fun, plenty of good characters and moments like the first Ritchie movies. It has also its own style not trying to be just a copycat of them.

From beginning to end his storytelling is forever crass and sharp witted, keeping you enthralled to the very end. Always bringing in new characters each with their own charisma adding different nuianceses to the script, but always keeping it on track.Mickey Pearson (McConaughey) a typical narcissistic arrogant Yank and Kingpin narcotic dealer is selling his business to who wants it the most. Matthew (Jeremy Strong) is the most likely but not before he does his own digging. He then hires a gang of youth wannabes under the eye of the coach (Farrell) to make a deadly mistake and try to take down Mickey. Then there is the Asian connection with young hotshot Dry Eye keen to also becoming ""the lion"". The narrator of this fine tale is Fletcher (Hugh Grant). This is Grant at his best, he was BRILLIANT in this role.This will go down as one of Guy's classics, it is really good. There's no doubt you will have a great laugh and enjoy.",The Gentlemen

411,jg_1977,An imperfect film but a perfectly good time at the movies,7,27 January 2020,"The Gentleman is definitely a welcome return to form for Ritchie, who has proven that the meh-ness of his most recent films is more a symptom of the Hollywood studio system rather than a lack of talent on his part. The Gentleman doesn't fit together quite as neatly as Lock, Stock but it has the same propulsive energy, crass yet laugh out loud humor, and stylized violence to satiate die-hard Richie fans. It's by no means a perfect film, but the stuff I liked, I REALLY liked, and the stuff that I didn't care for didn't come close to ruining it for me. That being said, The Gentleman isn't for everyone, particularly for people who aren't fans of Lock, Stock, Snatch, and the like.

A blend of flashback and current action pulls the storyline together into a cohesive bundle with a twist or two that keeps the little grey cells active. Enough gun play to satisfy the jaded audience of today and a touch of romance to sooth the savage beast.
Sexy women, handsome men, drug kingpins, moral dilemmas and retribution at its finest nestle alongside drama and black humor to keep you entertained. A simple plan turns into a horrendous mess resulting in a necessary comeuppence. Sound mysterious? Yeah, rent this movie. I hate spoilers.",The Gentlemen

The acting and actors are simply superb. And finally in true Ritchie-style, the innovative usage of the English language which separates this film from other tough-guy movies.
But if there is one thing which stops this from being an exceptional movie, it is Ritchie's unnecessary and sometimes pointless tradition of four-letter words. If any movie needs gore, sex or language to enhance it, it can demean it's quality. Unfortunately this movie loves the ""C"" word unlike true gentlemen, and while it might be just one fault, it could be one which isolates it from being a classic.",The Gentlemen

421,Tony_Fresh_Reviews,Overall: Great,8,20 July 2020,"Guy Ritchie returns to form with this fast-paced crime thriller. The movie is filled with witty dialogue and excellent performances all the way around. There were rarely any dull moments since all the characters were so fun and colourful, especially when the movie begins to add in elements of blackmail, bribery, deceit, and violence. However, the movie stumbles a bit in its first act. Dialogue comes at you with rapid-fire speed, which can get overwhelming and requires an adjustment period. (But that's most Guy Ritchie crime movies.) You just feel like you're already behind and need to catch up. Once you're adjusted to the narrative style and the movie settles in, everything comes together in an awesome final act.Recommended for: Fans of Guy Ritchie films, fans of colourful performances with witty dialogue, or fans of saying Phuc hundreds of times until you get it right.

It's a complicated tale about a turf war in the maijuana business - where everyone knows it will soon get legalised - therefore the end is near. One of the best acting ensembles in a movie recently with Mathew McConaughey, Colin Farrell and Hugh Grant (in a never-seen-before performance which is far removed from his romantic comedy roles). I thought his voice was dubbed; it isn't. Michelle Dockery is sensational in her small role. If you've seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch then you know what to expect. But instead of fast edits, narrative overlays in slow motion, etc, here you'll find static camera, actors on their marks, quick cuts and fast speaking performances. Not in the same league as Lock, Stock....and Snatch, yet it's an enjoyable 2 hour British crime caper that doesn't take itself too seriously.

This movie is a 'Guy Ritchie' movie, maybe not as masterful as Snatch and Lock Stock but would definitely rate it just below them.
Screenplay first and then story telling are the backbone of every movie and what makes a movie even more refined is a satisfying ending.
The story starts slow but by about 50 minute, it gathers the speed and then it is just 'Guy Ritchie'
Colin Farrell stole the show and McConaughey was brilliant. Kudos to Hugh grant and Charlie Hunnam for a great supporting cast.

430,reoroy,Guy Ritchie brilliantly returns to the gangster genre with a cohesively constructed jigsaw puzzle of a script,9,14 January 2020,"Guy Ritchie's new movie is a cohesively constructed jigsaw puzzle. The labyrinthine plot has all the trappings of an intriguing thriller. The director will make you navigate through an intricate web of deceit with splendid panache. Ultimately, all the excitement that builds up within you as the film progresses will be justified with a superb climax that will assure you about Guy Ritchie's brilliant return towards dabbling with the gangster genre.Every character appropraitely fits into the plot's grander scheme but Hugh Grant, who has off late become one of Richie's linchpins, was phenomenal. His character is perhaps one of the most complex yet fascinating characters I've seen on celluloid in recent times. And Matthew McConaughey has done himself a favour be being in this film. Richie knew how to tap Matthew's suave demeanour in just the right way.Watch this film and get reminded of movies like ""Lock, Stock and the Two Smoking Barrels"", ""Snatch"" and ""Rock n Rolla"". Ritchie's gangster universes are embellished with alluring complexities and this film is a cherry on Richie's delicious 'gangster-flavoured' cake.",The Gentlemen

What happens is the great hallmark of Ritchie and his epic style of fun, mixed with dose of action and plenty of witty and natural dialogue.
Ritchie continues pace from start to finish and the depth of the characters were on cue. Not only Matthew McConaughey, but Colin Farrell and many others add to story in their unique and impact ways that one could easily believe and relate to.

444,ljsmith-25626,Guy Ritchie Back to His Best,9,14 November 2020,"This movie should be rated way higher. It's Guy Ritchie back to his best, and for me The Gentlemen is every bit as good as Snatch and Lock Stock. At times the dialogue walks a racial tightrope, which I don't think has helped the overall rating here, while the C-bomb is used generously throughout. From what I've read online, this latter fact has horrified American viewers, who seemingly have not yet adopted the C-word as a staple of the English language as us Brits have.For any American viewer confused by this cultural phenomenon, I'll hand you over to The Coach (Colin Farrell) who hits the nail on the head when explaining to one of his boys that the word can be used as a term of ""familial affection"". That scene had me laughing out loud - it's also a perfect example of an instance whereby the script wobbles that aforementioned tightrope.I believe I loved The Gentlemen for aspects that other viewers hated. I'm sure what can be universally agreed however is the acting, soundtrack and storytelling are all absolutely on point. Special shoutouts must go to Hugh Grant, Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrell, who were all especially fantastic. Overall, The Gentlemen is a must watch. 9/10.",The Gentlemen

447,benmundie,So Funny With A Lot of Strong Language!!,9,12 November 2020,"'The Gentlemen' is a brilliant, hilarious film from fantastic film maker Guy Ritchie and written by Ritchie, Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies. This film follows Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) and Ray (Charlie Hunnam) as they try to sell off Pearson's highly profitable marijuana empire in the drug territory of London, triggering plots, schemes, bribery and blackmail in an attempt to steal his domain from under him.
The ensemble cast is breath-taking; Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Michelle Dockery, Colin Farrell, Henry Golding and Hugh Grant. I would've loved to see more scenes with Hunnam and McConaughey because they work really well together and bounce off each other really well.
The structure of the story is quite unique as the entire plot is being told like a story from Fletcher's (Hugh Grant) perspective to Ray. As the narrative advances the action starts to become full of twists especially with Pearson and Matthew (Jeremy Strong) nearer the end of the film.
However, this film isn't perfect. In the 3rd act's sound design is way too loud so it is difficult to here the dialogue. Also, it does take a while for it to get off the mark but when it does it is great.
Overall, I loved this film and it is obvious to see Ritchie's style bleed into every scene. I highly recommend this if you do not mind a lot of strong language.",The Gentlemen
448,hakan_respect,Thoughts on The Gentlemen,5,22 February 2020,"I had some expectations and doubts about this movie. The director Guy Ritchie directed some of my favourite films especially sherlock's 1 and 2nd movie. I really like some of his earlier works like Snatch and Lock, stock and two
barrels. He is one of the best directors when it comes to action for me. On the other hand I really disliked his King Arthur and skipped Aladdin. After watching the trailer of The Gentlemen I thought he was returning to his own style. Although movie reflects his style and narration of the movie could be considered as good. As a crime and mob boss movie it is not sufficient at all. Nearly all actors are very good in the movie but action scenes were very little and that's one of the biggest disappointment of the movie. I also expected some violence
from this movie and it was nowhere to be found.

458,jamesjchapman-37903,Go See It.,9,4 January 2020,"As a regular movie goer, I'll jump to the point and say this: definitely go see The Gentleman. Guy Ritchie nails it with this one. I was roped in, hook, line and sinker from the start and that's what it needed to do. All 113 minutes keeping you attentively sucked into the little twists and turns.Usually it doesn't take much to annoy me when it comes to narration, but this is a story - and a story told well. It's clever, it keeps pace, it doesn't stop. And it was more than I expected. Where it succeeds is holding you captive to the wonderment of anticipating every characters' next move on the plot chessboard that unfolds before you.The acting is great; I can't fault anyone in performance or their placement in their roles. Putting this film together...and I am just stubbornly refusing to give it the perfect 10 in my assessment as a 9... but it's just shy of being a modern theatrical masterpiece.If you get bored,, somehow lose it along the way... blame me.

From the instant success of ""two bong"", ""snatch"", ""revolver"", ""Sherlock Holmes"" and so on. It really got the fans going. In addition to the brilliant rolled-up story, the British setting, coupled with guy's bloody violence, the comedy, the soundtrack, and the mostly male cast, makes guy Ritchie's film stand out. In addition to that, you'll also see the actors who match the film's title dress (very tasteful), talk, use words, and have a lot of lines (admire Hugh grant) to add to the film's appeal.",The Gentlemen

This time, guy Ritchie's way of moving the story is not a coincidence but a balancing act between the characters' intelligence and their characters. The American businessman, the British drug dealer, the Chinese American criminal gang chaos fighting, does not waste any potential foist, the characters are numerous but the play sitting mind not chaos, the first half of the smoke, the second half of the crazy reversal, and Hugh grant's film commentary and ridicule, the end is wonderful.",The Gentlemen

Classic Guy Ritchie movie (funny, twists and turns, constant thrilling/entertaining/slightly bloody one-upping); long-time fans won't be disappointed.As I said, well-cast with no complaints but want to say Michelle Dockery was excellent, and I was happy to see Henry Golding get to show more gritty yet comedic range here. Hugh Grant seems to have gotten a second wind the last few years - he's great in this; same for Colin Farrell.Only complaints would be that I wish Eddie Marsan and Tom Wu had more screen time; both are fantastic supporting actors and it would have been nice to have seen more of them.Go, see, enjoy.",The Gentlemen

It is so stupid. The movie jumps back and forth between the Protagonist a the person telling a story about the Protagonist.

The story told by Fletcher was an interesting approach and created suspense as viewers wouldn't be sure if what he said was true or less so. It's almost as good as Snatch. The man (Ritchie) seems to have a thing for pikeys and the Irish by the way. Matthew McCon was perhaps a tad too classy for the part and the way he spoke reminded me a little of his role in True Detective. I was surprised by the little badness Hugh Grant seems to able to squeeze out in this role rather than the usual pouty posh parts he portrays in other films and is almost convincing enough to play a baddy.

It is like an excuse to get a bunch of Hollywood stars WORKING in SOMETHING to get them paid during the downturn. The story JUMPS, here and here, and here and here and geeze~ ! It is SO obvious that more money was spent on the elaborate costumes of the time, than was spent on the script itself. It's a high school quality play put to film by 'I don't know who' .
A sore waste of time. I forced myself to watch it for about 30 minutes, then puttered around the house, half listening to it, and finally turned it off.

To like Guy Ritchie's movies is like liking my grandma's borscht - other people may not fancy it even a tiny bit, but I grew up with it and I like it a lot.What I'm trying to say is that if you approach Ritchie's movies looking for an action movie, say Die Hard type of thing (not that is anything wrong with it), you'll be disappointed and you'll not going to like it, you'd be eating the borscht where you expected the burger. But if you open your mind to my grandma's cooking, and give her culinary masterpiece a chance, you'll find all the intricate tastes and finesse you never find in minced beef. And that's The Gentlemen for you: all the ingredients that youd never dream of liking separately mixed together in one wonderful dish. The cinema at its best, intelligent, masterfully executed on every level: acting, directing, camera, editing, music, sound effects, all of it is just the way it should be and worthy of the fantastic cast and crew.Oh yes, and it's darn funny, if you dig that sort of humor, and I'd like to believe we all do...8 stars only because of the Snatch.

The soundtrack was there; the costumes, the class actors, the wit and sudden changes in the storylines.
And yet...
None of the elements were as solid as before. The music wasn't that great. The climactic scenes weren't that memorable. The story wasn't that intriguing. I didn't really care for anyone in the cast, except Hugh Grant. I honestly didn't know who to root for thought the entire movie, and I really like Matthew MacC a lot.

510,The-MacMahonian,All Mod Cons,6,5 July 2020,"A very late start for the reviewing year, for no particular nor excusable reason. Since we start late, let's start coeval: The Gentlemen.The Gentlemen is the 12th feature film directed by Guy Ritchie, who beside penning the last two films of the Sherlock Holmes franchise virtually singlehandedly developed his own personal subgenre, namely the Italian Job (Peter Collinson, 1969)/Get Carter (Mike Hodges, 1971) spinoff mockney comedy caper thriller, which he inaugurated back in 1998 with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, reaching in The Gentlemen its till now baroquest peak.The unimaginatively titled The Gentlemen tells the unsummarizable unimaginative irresistible story of dope (as in cannabis, didn't know such a kind still existed) mega-dealer Mickey Pearson's (Mathew McConaughey) attempts to sell the business and leave the Life, unleashing intricate manoeuvres implicating the Jewish and Chinese mobs, and also brit toffs as sort of stationary mules (you have to see it to understand it), told mostly in a series of flash backs by private eye turned wannabe hustler Fletcher (Hugh Grant gone gay, stellar) to Pearson's right hand man Raymond (Charlie Hunnam) in the course of what has to be the most convoluted attempt at a shakedown in film history.Critical reception has been mixed, and the film can be said to be self-indulgent, self-referential, vapid and/or mercenary, but who in the name of rhyming slang cares? The Gentlemen is not a guilty pleasure, for the enormous pleasure does away with the guilt long before the first reel is through (films don't come in 10 minute reels anymore, and they haven't for decades, I know, I just like to write like this). The script is so jam-packed with one-liners I am seriously considering starting an online petition to have it published in book form (already seen a couple of hints in this direction in online chatrooms). Oh and there's Colin Farrell giving Hugh Grant a run for his money for best performance as MMA coach Coach (that´s not a typo, it´s what he is called). And also a soundtrack the 20th Century Englishness of which stands, if memory serves, unmatched, including inter alia Roxy Music's 1973 In 'Every Dream Home a Heartache' and the Jam's 'That's Entertainment', to name but two tracks I hadn't listened to in decades but recognized instantly (although it did take my brain some 20 seconds to reset from the delusion that the latter track was by XTC).So I can't wait for the sequel, titillating insinuations to which were included in the current effort, and would dear to suggest Guy Richie commits his formidable dialogue-writing talent to the script, commissions directing to Shane Meadows and casts Michael Caine and the Kemp bros.",The Gentlemen

It's got every element you'd expect from Ritchie, and while I would say it doesn't disappoint, The Gentlemen also doesn't quite live up to Ritchie's masterpieces like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch. By no means does that mean this is a weak film, I do think it was a stronger effort than RocknRolla. Hugh Grant leads with a fascinating performance as a private investigator who also doubles as a narrator of sorts who Ritchie uses as a vehicle to unfold and explain the story in a truly unique manner. Colin Farrell has some show stealing moments as Coach, and he seriously might be the best part of the whole movie. The Gentlemen is cool, fast and fun. If you've enjoyed any of Ritchie's previous work in the genre, you'll want to check this one out.",The Gentlemen

519,westerfieldreviews,"""The American Lion in the English Jungle""",8,8 February 2020,"""The American Lion in the English Jungle""Guy Ritchie returns to both the writing and directing chair to craft an exciting action-filled comedy that only he and he alone could create. ""The Gentlemen"" stars a wide array of talent that perfectly bring Ritchie's patented expressive dialogue to life with every word they utter. The excitement in this film is not solely found in the action and gunshots that were heavily marketed but is instead felt within the elaborate narrative that keeps at a steady pace, along with the eccentric characters that help shepherd it along. Ritchie's style bleeds throughout this film's core from the very opening title credits, to the final cut to black; all of his standard trademarks are here which some may find tiresome, while others will find great enjoyment out of. Nevertheless, it should go without saying that with Ritchie in the driver's seat ""The Gentlemen"" is an immensely entertaining film that will keep audiences engaged in its wonderful world of formalized chaos.
""The Gentlemen"" centers around the suave Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a kingpin that reigns over his established marijuana empire as he navigates throughout London attempting to remain on top, despite the many adversarial forces he faces along the way (But it is far more complex than that). A private investigator known only as Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is hired by Big Dave (Eddie Marsan), an editor for the Daily Print tabloid with the strict assignment of investigating Pearson's personal ties to a royal named Lord Pressfield (Samuel West). During the course of his investigation, Fletcher uncovers several secrets shrouded in mystery and deception. It is realized, that Pearson is fully intent on selling his business to the American billionaire, Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) for a grand sum of $400 million. However, at the exact same time, a young Chinese crime boss named, Dry Eye (Henry Golding) is looking to relieve Pearson of the stress by outright buying the entire establishment. When Pearson refuses, he and his wife Rosalind Pearson (Michelle Dockery) along with his right-hand man Raymond (Charlie Hunnam) are thrust into a world of chaos where they are the primary targets everyone is aimed at. Having said that, it should be noted that the first two-thirds of the film are framed within a late-night conversation Fletcher invites Raymond to, with regards to his findings. Fletcher fully intends on selling his discoveries to Raymond in exchange for £20 million or he will go to print, a simple blackmail technique.
Ritchie provides an exhilarating screenplay that keeps audiences glued to their seats guessing where it will go next and just when you think you've figured it out, the film takes a complete detour of absurdity that most would fail in their attempts The film rarely stops to take a break which on paper may seem like a real flaw; but for ""The Gentlemen"" it is not. The narrative is told by the character of Fletcher and it feels extremely meta, so much so that a poster of one of Ritchie's previous projects can be spotted for keen eyes. This type of narrative structure is a technique that some may find distracting and unfocused, but I personally find it to be brilliant. After the beautiful opening credits, we are instantly thrown into a shocking moment that immediately grabs your attention like a salacious headline; it is hard to forget. With this inciting moment now lodged in our brains, the audience becomes hyper-focused as they watch in awe eagerly waiting for that fatal moment to come back; and when it finally does, it is just as shocking as it was when we first witnessed it. Although this is a method used by many writers and directors, Ritchie pulls it off in a way that does not entirely spoil the film from the offset. With the film's events unfolding through Fletcher's recounting of the situations, as an actual written screenplay titled, ""Bush"" you cannot help but be fully captivated. The constant callbacks to past incidents and shifts of perspective all add to create a story that is one of the most entertaining ones of the year.""The Gentlemen"" as I expressed earlier, is a film constructed by an auteur that relishes in a flashy, yet extravagant style that only he could design. From a very entry-level observation, the first thing that will catch anyone's attention are the elaborate and debonair outfits everyone on the cast, dons. Regardless of whether it is a fresh tapered suit, a loose-fitting jacket, or a bold tracksuit, every character showcased on-screen displays a level of sophistication only Guy Ritchie could pull off. Every shoe, every top, every pair of glasses; every single article of clothing appears to have been hand-picked as a means of painting each individual cast member as a figure you will not soon forget. Surprisingly, this quality is not exclusive to only the main cast as many of the extras also have a unique visual flavor that brings more life into every moment. When the film travels from scene to scene, the characters look fantastic, but so is the dialogue they are speaking. Ritchie's use of language is rather impressive as none of his characters are presented as shallow one-trick ponies. Every line of dialogue is pointed with a purpose that perfectly sets the stakes for every scene as all of the actors and actresses are constantly vying to dominate the verbal battles they find themselves in. With metaphors and jokes littered all throughout, it is hard to not find all of the English accents just a bit endearing. Unfortunately, on the flip side, because of how animated the characters and their words can be at times, they will occasionally slip into the territory of a cartoonish caricature of themselves. It is not distinctively a fault of the film that ruins it by any means, but it can be a bit overwhelming from time to time (A sentiment that is true for the entirety of the film).
""The Gentlemen"" is a blast of a film that explodes with character and features a fabulous cast that all bring their best. From the costumes and sets to the characters and their dialogue, Ritchie's fingerprints are all over this film and it appears as though he is playing in a wheelhouse where he feels the most comfortable. Now of course, if you are not a fan of Guy Ritchie's films or his overabundant style, then ""The Gentlemen"" may not be your cup of tea. However, the story and visual flair used to present it, flows throughout every frame and is certainly something that will entertain from beginning to end. Truly the first must-watch of 2020.Final Verdict - B-",The Gentlemen
520,Sara_Tor,Retread,6,6 June 2021,"This was mostly a retread. It was no Lock, Stock or Snatch, but it was an ok way to spend a Saturday evening. The actors enjoyed their roles, which was amusing. It was super cringey at times though, and that took the fun out of parts of it.",The Gentlemen
521,SimonsRants,Ritchie Returns (Somewhat) to Form,7,4 November 2020,"The Gentlemen - 7/10Sometimes I honestly don't understand where the critics are coming from.
With this one, I would've agreed with them had I stopped watching around the middle and maybe that's what they did. The pretentiousness of the film dripped with Ritchie's self-importance that the story and movie itself didn't deserve. This movie took itself more seriously than anything he'd made since Snatch, yet it didn't do anything to earn that distinct honor bestowed on it. However, in the second half it seemed to shed the entitled demands to be taken seriously and just let loose in a rather enjoyable, silly gangster flick. Still, nothing spectacular as it was still a self-indulgent style over substance mess at times with dialogue so contrived only the best actors could power their way through leaving behind the lesser actors to wallow in the melodrama of it all. But I'll be damned if I wasn't entertained by the film enough to give it a 7/10 and give it the distinction of being Ritchie's 4th best film. However, he'd only made 3 good films before this so I'm not sure that that means much.",The Gentlemen

527,rajveerdhanak,All Style and Little Substance.,7,10 April 2020,"""The Gentlemen"" follows an American marijuana kingpin in England who is looking to sell his business, setting off a chain of blackmail and schemes to undermine him.This film is a mixed bag for me. I hadn't watched any of Guy Ritchie's films prior to this - but being aware of his trademark directing style, I can understand how this film had connected with fans of Ritchie's work - many defining this as a return to his form after a few disappointments.Hence, the following review is simply a biased account of my viewing experience, and not intended to comment on the merit of the film itself.It took me a lot of patience to get through the first half, which spent its time establishing the players of the story and the intricate plot. After a while, I kept the film playing in the background, listening to it while solving a puzzle or doing some other pastime. The second half is where the film picked up, the point where the current ongoing plot connects with the hooking prologue of the film.The tone is the traditional trademark style of Guy Ritchie - which prioritizes style over substance. The style here being the cockney-accent heavy cussing, violence and contrived twists and turns in the plot. The substance - depth in character, theme explored, etc. - are all things I personally look for in a film, and I must admit I came looking for it in the wrong film. My bad.The highlight of this film are the performances and chemistry between the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey - playing the suave leader who keeps his cool until triggered, Charlie Hunnam (the dependable and resourceful right-hand man), Colin Ferrell (the foil characters who comes across the primary players and cooperates with them to be on their good side), and finally Hugh Grant (the unreliable narrator and a weasel who sides with the highest bidder).The 'twists-and-turns' nature is most prominent at the climax, which can have a polarizing effect on the audiences - depending on whether its ending feels satisfying to the audiences. I personally wasn't satisfied - given how little I connected with the characters in the first place.I can conclude that I'm not the intended audience for this film. I do like the gangster-thriller genre, but this one failed to resonate for me. However, I'm sure the target audience will have a great time watching ""The Gentlemen"", and I rate this film 7/10 out of respect for the filmmakers and their hard-work on this.",The Gentlemen
528,thewhelk,A parody of Guy Richie at his best,6,23 January 2020,"Whilst there are plenty of enjoyable moments in this film, one can not help getting distracted by the endless quips and witty one liners. It boils down to the law of diminishing returns - too much of anything and it will eventually lose its impact. This could be said about much of the dialogue and plot trajectory. The Gentleman is fun, it's flashy, it's amusing - it's Guy Richie. But it also feels like a rehashed pastiche of a bygone era. An era when he made crime movies that were genuinely funny and gripping. It is with a heavy heart that the same can not be said of this one. It felt hollow and contrived in comparison to his more iconic earlier works.He does however notably take on the woke brigade; for this, Guy, I doff my cap to you sir.",The Gentlemen
529,christonr-64261,Cradle-Snatching,7,13 January 2020,"Pulp Fiction meets Snatch here as Guy Ritchie tries to explain why they don't make gangsters (or films about them) like 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale any more.Told through the non-chronolgical, non-reliable narrator trope; The Gentleman weaves and winds and twists and turns from an initial scene containing an unexpected execution* to imagined and suggested actions being interspliced with new revelations to create a tapestry of true(ish) events.Hugh Grant is great and used as a vehicle to spout increasingly ridiculous radical - often racist - slurs in a way which is both sleazy and charming; all whilst being equally predatory and menacing as he taunts and jabs at Charlie Hunham's younger protagonist.A couple of characters get a little lost in this world; but this appears to be an insistence of Ritchie indulging some of his new Hollywood friends rather than for plot necessity or sense. I suppose - if you dig deep enough - it could be argued there's an analogy in there somewhere of American businessman exploiting UK markets for their own gain.On the whole though, the Gentleman is enjoyable enough. Some great set pieces (see South London council estate) are interspersed with genuinely gripping character moments and dialogue a la early Tarantino; with this often offset with black-hearted comedy side-plots and riffs.On the flip side however, there are a couple of scenes in particular with some troubling attitudes and approach towards the use of sexual violence and assault as a means to disempower and subjugate. The beastiality scene is especially unsettling and the character who falls victim to this fate is not-nearly given the backstory, arc, actions or motivations to deserve such a fate. Equally, the attempted, near-rape of the only speaking female character in the film seems an unnecessary shift in tone and dynamic.Aside from this, The Gentleman also seems to want to distance itself from it's contemporaries in the genre. Ritchie appears to make a concerted effort to ensure younger, aspirational characters are routinely humiliated, degraded and/or ultimately out-thought/fought. The title of the film even suggests his distain for the newer gangster; as reflected in scenes such as Charlie Hunham's confrontation with a gang in an alleyway. Colin Farrell's gang of ""Toddlers"" do get their moment in the sun as part of a ""fight porn"" video package and small victory over unamed goons to showcase their skills, but when push-comes-to-shove, even they are given bit-part odd-jobs in service of Matthew McConaughey's Mickey.Don't get me wrong, this is an enjoyable film overall and a good addition to the Guy Ritchie canon. It has more to say -in present terms, anyway - than Lock, Stock or Snatch, but it's still probably 10-15 years behind where it needs to be.",The Gentlemen
530,nomanza,Great Movie,9,30 March 2020,"In the beginning you think it's a boring story which is completely told. But at a certain point you find yourself solving the puzzle.

531,Sabaher,Best Guy Ritchie fim in the last 20 years,8,28 January 2020,"This is a true return to form. The thing that made Ritchie famous was making highly stylized underground crime thrillers that are really funny with quirky characters. He is not copying his movies from 20 years ago, but he does what he did before with more mature version of it. It has all the visual style, the quick cuts, all of that fun stuff that we liked before but it's not the same version of it. He has updated his bag of tricks. The nature of the storytelling is differtent. Even the age of the lead character is a man that's about Ritchie's age right now. That makes for a nice refreshing return to the thing that he did before without feeling like he's trying to force all of it.The cast here is amazing. With each of these actors Ritchie gives them a fun and odd role that just makes for an ensemble characters that you like watching. It just makes for a lot of quotable lines and great memorable scenes. The standouts her would be (though it was very hard to choose) Hugh Grant. Here we get him doing something pretty different from his usual thing, but it still has all that charm and charisma. Another standout is Charlie Hunman. I haven't seen a ton of his stuff, but this is my personal favorite of his roles so far.The movie builds momentum as it goes along. As you discover how the pieces are fitting together and what's actually happening, you get more and more investested in wanting to see how it's all going to pay off. All the stuff that it sets up absolutely leads to big moments of payoff.It's good for a movie to build momentum as it goeas along. It's good for a movie to end on a high note. But I felt like this one had such a build of momentum and intrigue that the beginning felt like it kind of meandered a little bit.The first 30-40 minutes of the film drags a good bit and is by far the most confusing part of the film. It's told using this framing device involving the dialogue scenes between Grant and Hunnam. Because of this it's so disjointed in the way that it's told in trying to be stylized at times and you don't fully understand who the Hugh Grant character is and what their relationship is because the characters haven't fully been introduced yet. I wasn't quite aure exactly what was going on so it took some time for me to get fully invested in the film. Once it gotten to a certain where you understood the characters and what is going on I was invested. But it took longer than it should have to get to that point.There's also a couple of reveals in the finale that I just thought were so obvious that I'm not even sure if they wew supposed to be presented as reveals.Overall this was a solid return to form for Guy Ritchie showing that he can still write great characters and story.8/10 If you're a Guy Ritchie fan go see this movie.",The Gentlemen

All the performances are excellent. I can't fault this movie in any way. Maybe it isn't the bestest movie evar, but I can safely say it will be one of the best of 2020.Charlie Hunnam is legitimately scary. McConaughey nails his role.

545,danielefanin-17409,Midway upon the journey of a criminal life,7,25 April 2020,"Not always is going forward a necessary improvement.
This is proved by Guy Ritchie's latest movie, The Gentlemen, a brilliant coming back of the British director, after the detours from his original imprint and trade mark represented by Aladdin (2019), King Arthur (2017) and in a way also The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015), as well as the diptych of Sherlock Holmes, to his origins, those that brought him success and a distinctive narrative and filmic style centered around the London criminal underworld.
Nobody really believes that the British criminal gangs medley so gracefully cruelty and greed with the irresistibly cool, debonair attitude that denote Guy Ritchie's characters, but it is honestly pleasant to find them again on the screen, it is a like meeting after a long time a distant relative, a bit dissolute but in the end loved and, to a certain extent, even secretly envied without admitting it.The American Mickey Pearson, well played by Matthew McConaughey, crossed the Atlantic to study at Oxford but soon became a drug kingpin, aptly able to benefit from his contacts with the needy British aristocracy to build a commercial empire for the illegal production and distribution of marijuana on a national scale.
Midway upon the journey of his criminal life and happily married to true cockney Rosalinde, he decides to transit to legality and offers to sell all his activities to Jewish entrepreneur Matthew, constantly body-guarded by former Mossad agents.
This decision sparks a far-reaching series of effects and subplots that bring onboard various secondary characters, amongst whom Colin Farrell steals the show, that are craftily kept together for the viewers by Fletcher, an investigative journalist working for a tabloid which chief editor holds a grudge against Pearson. Fletcher intends to monetise through blackmail the information he has collected, and those he has only guessed to fill the gaps of what he still doesn't know, and contacts Pearson's top man, Raymond, excellently played by a Charlie Hunnam much more at ease here than as King Arthur. Hugh Grant as Fletcher is in sterling form here, lending an unusual and idiosyncratic charm to a role that deviates, and we should say thankfully and eventually, from the expected characters he has built his successful career on.Mixing his trademark brisk and sparkling dialogues, Tarantino-like yet unmistakably made in Ritchie, with a crafted and expected British-ness of costumes and settings and a pleasant, defining yet not intrusive soundtrack, The Gentlemen is, to put it simply, a very good movie that gives the viewers what is expected of Guy Ritchie, sprinkling cinephile quotes (Coppola's The Conversation, old film reels) and well-integrated self-quotes (Snatch's pigs and poster of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. amongst others) on an excellent camerawork servicing a tight narrative pace whose thread, mainly for Fletcher's catchy story-telling, is never lost during the film and until its, partially unexpected, ending.A step back, but towards the quality if his directorial origins, for Guy Ritchie, The Gentlemen will not be remembered for its innovations but it is a solid, well-written, directed and acted, genre movie.

552,lshu-04094,The Gentlemen,9,17 May 2020,"It's still relevant, gentlemen. Belonging to the kind of good-looking movie, Guy Ritchie returns to the early style: multi clue, multi character, excellent rhythm control, all kinds of black humor and satire, addictive violence scenes, as well as playing with the plot and the audience. Plus a few actors are particularly handsome, but the visibility is still very high. Charlie Hannum has played a particularly flattering role. It's really flattering.",The Gentlemen
553,peamorrortu,Nice ol' gangster thriller,8,1 September 2020,"This was a good thriller to watch. Fust paced, full of tense and action-packed scenes, while it also took time to explore the main characters and their motivations, giving us a pretty complete picture. I didn't quite like the narrated-speculated intro, were Hugh Grant narrates the story and the action keeps cutting back and forth from the events to the conversation he is having with Charlie Hunnan's character, but it does give some comedic interaction and character development to the film, so it is still watchable (though I think it would have been best done in some other way), and once it gets past that point the twists and turns get only better. The ending is satisfatory and well crafted, so, if you love gangster-like thriller, this is a movie you will like.",The Gentlemen
554,michaelquinn1966,Good but not great,5,25 March 2020,"Edit.... just finished rewatching The Gentlemen and must say enjoyed it much more on the second watch, its still not a nine or ten rated film but I would have scored it a strong Eight this time.Cant really understand all the 10/10, 9/10 scores for The Gentlemen. Was it an enjoyable couple of hours, on the whole yes. Was it as good as Lock Stock or Snatch, never came close. It had it's funny moments but far to much felt a bit forced, the script was no where near as sharp as either of the afore mentioned films and really it wasn't even good or original as Rock'n' Rolla.Now to my main problem with this film and the massive question of originality or the distinct lack of, in Hollywood these days. The Gentleman was basically a tired attempt to redo The Long Good Friday, yes the premise was slightly different but aspects like the gun ""hands across the sea"" engraving on the derringer but what is unforgivable and so,nothing Ritchie should be ashamed of, is where he ripped off the iconic final Bob Hoskins scene when he is taken by the IRA in his own car, everything down to the expressions McConaughey and the gunman pointing his gun between the seats was just copied from LGF, lazy, lazy writing.As I said, it is worth a watch but prepare to be left a little dissatisfied.",The Gentlemen

556,thibault-li,One of the most stylish movie ever but no substance,7,28 March 2020,"Guy Ritchie comes back with an umpteenth flick.
It's a Lock stock and two smoking barriers movie with smartphones, YouTube and a scene from Black Mirror... all in full HD and with Matthew Mcconaughey.
Don't expect any moral or characters' developments.
Prepare to watch a gallery of handsome and badass characters spitting badass lines. It's very well-crafted and with precise direction but it lacks memorable scenes.
Music and sound editing are on point (except for some really loud scenes) but it's rather forgettable.
The movie relies a lot on the actors' charisma especially Matthew Mcconaughey and Hugh Grant.
Matthew and all his crew are a mix of gentlemen and gangsters, you won't root for them and they'll get out of situation in no time anyway. Sir Hugh Grant is by far the best and only funny character of the movie thanks to his narration skills, his filmmaking references and his gay jokes to Charlie Hunham.
It's cute but not sexy. It's funny but lacks humor. There's technology but it's not modern.
Snatch is a true classic and came up to the level of Pulp Fuction. The Gentlemen doesn't reach them.",The Gentlemen

Hopefully he does well in Batman. Hugh Grant finally demonstrated some unknown range and I think these kind of characters would suit him in future.

This posh English fantasy tail is phenomenally mixed by Hugh Grant's incredible acting-narration and helps bubble up what could have, at times, been an offensive mess, into an entertaining old-fashioned caper. The film sometimes lacks originality with some of its plot and joke ingredients, however fruity writing and timing helps deliver a nice smooth overtone. Charlie's Hunnam should note that Sons of Anarchy was his rise to fame, because he can play a gangster so bloody well. McConaughey held the incredible cast together, and Farrell was a nice sprinkle over the top. Unfortunately the flawless ensemble did expose Henry Golding as the weaker gentlemen, and for the time-being he may want to stick to rom-coms, but only time will tell.

574,bradersl7,Ritchie back to crime and what a return!,9,4 August 2020,"Guy Ritchie's last directed film was Aladdin, a film which I felt was completely wrong for Ritchie. The film wasn't the best and that's not Ritchies fault as such, I believe that this is down to the restrictions from Disney. The Gentlemen was the opposite, it's obvious that he had a lot of fun directing this film and it's Guy Ritchie back in the crime genre! What more can you want!The first act especially before Colin Farrell's character (Coach) is very slow paced and once Coach comes in, the pace picks up a hell of a lot. The plot is about Hugh Grant's character (Fletcher) is ""black mailing"" Ray and Mickey (played but Charlie Hunnam and Matthew McConaughey respectively) as Fletcher is an investigative reporter for a large tabloid paper. Mickey runs a secretive weed empire in England and Ray is his calm and collective assistant, Fletcher finds out how it is ran and is attempting to get £20 million from them to stop the story from running. Meanwhile Mickey is trying to sell and get of out the game, he shows one of his weed growing sites to a potential buyer (Matthew played by Jeremy Strong). Matthew is trying to get the whole empire on the cheap and tells wannabe gangster to steal the weed and make the asking price lowered.That is the plot, it's straight forward but it's Guy Ritchie, you need to pay attention throughout, especially early on! Each character adds a lot to the film and there isn't too much forced exposition as the film is played out in one night with cut backs to what Fletcher says what he has found out. Charlie Hunnam plays a very calm and intelligent assistant with a small amount of humour which he plays very well and it's obvious that Ritchie likes to works with him since King Arthur and I'm looking forward to what Hunnam brings in the future and hopefully with Ritchie too.There is a lot of humour which mainly comes from Fletcher (Hugh Grant) who is almost unrecognisable from his usual roles but does so so well, he plays this role without a fault. His accent is flawless throughout! Mickey (McConaughey) is similar to Hunnam's character being calm most of the time, respectful and intelligent but there are points where he loses his temper and has to get his hands dirty and McConaughey has it in him, he is intimidating and threatening and doesn't even need to lift a finger. Farrell (Coach) does very well, he adds some more humour to the film and plays the character very well as a man with experience but has morales and you can tell he almost hates the new sort of gangster (like all the gangsters in this film).Overall, the film is a class act! The casting was flawless and the way the film was played out adds a real rewatch ability to this film. I feel like everyone put the film down before it come out because it was on the January premiere list but this is honestly one of the best crime films I've seen in a while, maybe even rivals crime films like The Departed. There is a lot of camera sequences like the car crash is so nice to watch, the video edits on the fights and impressive and relevant to what people would do nowadays too! This film will become a classic crime film which will hold up for years to come, I feel especially in England as it's more relatable.",The Gentlemen
575,new-44281,Brilliant Ritchie strikes again and does so with both barrels.,9,21 April 2020,"Guy Ritchie, what else needs to be said? He's put out movies that are nothing short of classics. It's been a minute since we've seen something come out from him and he kicks in the door with The Gentlemen as a ""did you miss me"".
Is there nothing Matthew Mcconaughey can't master in the acting world? He put on a performance that goes against anything we've seen from him before and I must say I LOVE his character and his believability.
Charlie Hunnam gets his first chance to really shine in my opinion. He's a wonderful actor but this sets him apart as being more than just a great looking lad with tallent.
Hugh Grant, who has really fallen off the popularity list of A level actors, makes this a personal calling card to say ""I'm still here and I'm GREAT""! And he is great in this, steals the show on many levels and you'll love him all over again!
Colin Farrell comes into the movie towards the final third but shows why hie's an A lister! Funny, versatile, and just damn believable in whatever role you give him.
Michelle Dockery, plays Matty boys wife and gives one truly wonderful, bad ass, and funny performance.
As far as the plot? Who cares! You know you're going on a British gangster ride with Guy Ritchie, just sit back and enjoy brilliant actors doing brilliant things, in brilliant roles, with a brilliant storyline. Truly a classic set from day one. Bravo!",The Gentlemen

577,deathiscoming-1,Definitely a return to form for Guy Richie and Co.,9,2 January 2020,"Now, if you've seen Snatch and Lock Stock, watch a One minute trailer for Gentlemen and you'll know exactly what you're in for. This is what Guy Ritchie does best. Is it mildly formulaic? Yes, but is it a fantastic watch? Yes! And I have to say, that's kind of the point when you're going to the big screen. In essence it's a story about a drug lord trying to get out, but can't, with all the classic Guy Ritchie antics along the way.I've read some of the ""critics"" on this movie and find that once again they're completely off the mark when it comes to understanding what audiences want. The nearly all male cast was on point. We know Guy Richie doesn't write compelling female characters (circa Rock n' Rolla), so why waste your time - and what's wrong with ""enticing a male-heavy demographic""? The anti-woke jokes and witty dialogue were on point. The classic boxing ring side scene (and even the car trunk scene for that matter) proved this sentiment exactly - men cuss each other out of love, get over it - and was a much needed middle finger to today's socio-political environment (as other recent movies (The Joker) have also compellingly done so.) And finally, the spaghetti western meets London gangster ensemble was also on point. It is what he does best, so why fix something that isn't broken?For the so-called critics and toffs too blind to see something deeper, look past the realistically played London yobbos and see snapshots portraying the very real London class and generational divide. Look past the slapstick humour and see the changing face of London portrayed through it's changing music, it's variety of faces, it's changing dress sense, it's issues with knife crime, the destruction of today's youth potential by hard narcotics, the story of a gym coach training disadvantaged youths to be better and see that a woman can run a successful high end car garage. The obligatory woke nod had to be there, but it didn't feel as such because it wasn't forced (MU EndGame or Rise of Skywalker), but actually relevant to- and impacting the storyline in significant ways.Performances were fantastic bar a few minor accents fails, and although I was sceptical about Hugh Grant playing (gay?) gangster I was very pleasantly surprised! I'm not sure the very British humour (including it's cuss words/phraseology) will be understood by those outside the UK but am sure it'll be the reason this movie gets poor ratings. I loved the Toddlers, their intro and names were hilarious as was their fighting, acting and portrayal within London today. I thoroughly enjoyed the Easter Eggs; the nod to Quentin Tarantino style camera/film pull-back and on-screen scribbling, the parody of poorly dubbed Chinese films, the visit to Miramax, and the moment when Michelle Dockery (who plays Rosalind) had her Will Smith style MIB deadly-pea-shooter moment were all just brilliant.My only beef, a potential plot hole that came at the end, the shooting from the back of the van. How did they know where to be and who, how...? Maybe I missed something, but that seemed like a hole that ruined the end for me.Overall, a definite return to form. Classic Guy Richie story, done well, modernised, with a peppering of just the right amount of anti-woke and British humour to make you laugh from start to finish.Even my very ""proper"" wife enjoyed it.",The Gentlemen

I won't say he's perfect because I haven't loved everything he's done, but I have liked everything he's done and The Gentlemen is no exception. A very finely told tale of blackmail and drug running on an epic scale, Guy Ritchie knows the art of storytelling.I won't spoil it by giving a synopsis, since I'm sure everyone else has done that and some people don't like to know how a story goes before they see/hear it. But I will say that, despite overusing the c bomb in the script and a highly unpleasant projectile vomiting scene, what I enjoyed the most was the back and forth between Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam, who are the real stars of this film. The dialogue is genius, punctuated by some genuinely funny moments. It's nice to see Michelle Dockery transcend Downton Abbey and Matthew McConaughey gets it done. There's a fine line between good acting and annoying with McConaughey and I'm pleased to say that this performance is the former.A good film. Thumbs up.",The Gentlemen

Perhaps one has been spoiled by Tarantino movies ? What must be said however, is that it is still a fun film.Matthew McConaughey is good as always. Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrel brings out quite fine performances as well. Hugh Grant is however the star of The Gentlemen, and he's just so damn slimy and spitting out so many comedically absurd statements that you just can't help but smile when he is let loose.The choice of music is perfect. A little favorite of mine; David Rawlings - ""Cumberland Gap"".At times, I think there is simply too much dialouge, which led to some confusion in following the plot. ""Who's side is he on, wait what why did he do that?"" my thoughts could be summarized as during those moments. Still, the movie does not lack funny moments, and I think they serve as ""redeemers"".To conclude; The Gentlemen is a fun movie with fine acting, but unfortunately it is for me lacking in some departments.

593,kevingoodwin,Poorly Constructed with Appalling Acting,4,1 April 2020,"Look I know Ritchie has the geezer approach to directing, but really you have to be more proffessional than this. With a stellar cast the whole thing should have been sleek and well put together , which it isn't.
Lets forget the numerous continuity mistakes which litter the film , some listed on this site, lets forget the wooden acting of Hunnam who at times appears to freeze as if waiting for a prompt, the fact that his supposed regional accent which appears to roam the UK like a group of itinerants, but can we really forgive the clumsy direction as this movie stutters along from a disparate collection of images.
The implausability at times is frankly breath taking. The group of druggies , well known for DIY, miraculously have a hammer on the coffee table in order to give the guy a weapon with which to attack the heavy. The upmarket daughter druggie who just like that gives up her friends and the life in the squat, just like that. The fact that the Hugh Grant character is there, with a camera, at exactly the right second to snap the fallen youth. The Hannam character runs through the street coat tails flapping chasing the guy with the phone, but amazingly a few seconds later , withdraws a big f off assault rifle just when he needs it from beneath the said coat. Lets not go into the ludicrous scene where the trainee boxers do cart wheels etc in the theft of the grass.
I know it's only a movie but unless you are appealing to the slapstick market, you must do better than this, much, much better Ritchie. Likewise Hugh Grant, his pivotal role was played like someone from a rep company at times, it wasn't funny, it wasn't vaguely threatening as he was hinting at, it was just well blah, pretty much like the whole offering..

To them, I must say, ""please, fellows, LIGHTEN UP!"" I'll get this out of the way: I'm a woman of color. I'm a bleeding heart liberal. There. Everybody feel good? Normally, I get pretty prickly whilst reading a certain kind of IMDB review that's a thinly disguised alt-right whine-fest at having to watch (gasp) women, people of color and ""teh gays"" play roles that used to be exclusively for straight white dudes.In ""The Gentlemen"", there are racial slurs, and one of the Jewish characters and the gay character aren't ""good guys"". But the ""racism"" is presented as tongue-in-cheek, and a reflection of the stupidity and unlikeability of the characters voicing it. I think you have to be pretty humorless, pedantic, and incredibly eager to be offended to snippily mount your high horse and complain about ""The Gentlemen"" being ""horribly"" racist.As far as the performances, my gawd is this a great cast!!! Hunnam and Grant are standouts, but everyone is firing on all cylinders. And per usual in a Ritchie film, the soundtrack is just CRACKING, filled with some 70s deep cuts from Roxy Music and Can, as well as some impeccably chosen obscurist tracks from artists like El Michels Affair's horn-filled cover of Wu Tang's ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya"". The haunting, folksy opening credits song, ""Cumberland Gap"" will be echoing in your head for weeks.If you're capable of getting over yourself, ""The Gentleman"" is a solid choice that stands up to MANY MANY re-watchings. A solid YES!!!",The Gentlemen

603,marilenapoul_17,Just wow,9,1 February 2020,What a clever movie. In the beginning i thought it was a bit slow but it was necessary for the viewer to understand the plot and everyone involved in it.

One of the best movies I've seen lately I highly recommend it,The Gentlemen

606,jonesama-429-85018,A great overall experience,7,28 February 2020,"The Gentlemen is an easy watch and Guy Ritchie strikes again by offering a great blend of thrill, comedy and action. Despite predictable plot avenues and a couple of cliche scenes, the film provided a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Great performances from all the cast with notable shout outs to Hugh Grant who plays a character far from his usual, and Colin Farrell who, as always, brings great wit and comedy. The film is far from the level that Snatch and Lock Stock are at but is definitely Ritchie's best film since those.",The Gentlemen
607,haroldwilson66,Cracking good fund - Hugh Grant is absolutely hilarious and Lady Mary Crawley is awesome too!,9,16 October 2020,"I like Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam and generally enjoy most of the stuff they have starred in.But for me the main stars of this film are Hugh Grant, Michelle Dockery and Colin Farrell (and I don't generally like Colin - except for his Bruges movie!)Hugh Grant is absolutely hilarious in this film - I really wish he had more screen time. After his fun role in Paddington I think he plays villains better than the good guy!
And watching Lady Mary Crawley playing an Essex gangsters strong independent partner was just incredible. I wish she had much more screen time as well.And Colin Farrells character is incredibly good fun too - really enjoyed every moment he was on screen.In contrast Charlie Hunnam's character and acting was pretty dull and flat.If you enjoy an gangster movie with some humour then watch this- time well spent!",The Gentlemen

I always stare them with my nose slightly upturned but equally always enjoy them by the end. There is a formula, we know this, but they are fast becoming one of my guilty pleasures.This movie is beautifully crafted and now I must watch everything Michelle Dockery has ever been in.A romping good yarn - but the 'C' word is used too often and like it's big and clever (it's not), hence only 9/10.",The Gentlemen

The mantis catches cicadas, the Yellow finch is behind, the Yellow finch is behind the eagle, the eagle is behind the hunter, but the police are standing behind the hunter and watching all this. The intricate plot is shown by continuous interleaving and flashback, which increases the brilliance of the film.",The Gentlemen

621,trrope,So I was told spouting exposition was bad storytelling,8,12 July 2020,"Apparently it isn't always the case. This film was a lot of fun with great acting and twists all along. Some of these twists were a bit arbitrary or not very well earned but they moved the story along. I was kind of diappointed when to movie ended, it might as well have continued twisting the story even more.
My bigger issue is that I didn't really care for anyone in the story, nobody was relatable or particularly interesting. But this was not the goal of it, i guess.
For sure this is a new typical Guy Ritchie movie that's only a bit worse than his greatest ones.",The Gentlemen

A bit of humor tossed in here and there. I seriously don't know what else a movie needs.Not sure why some critics had a problem with it. Maybe it didn't further some ""woke"" agenda or whatever. One critic actually complained that it was dated chiefly because it did not. Ridiculous. It was a riot.

Funny and clever, arch and self-conscious without becoming pretentious or convoluted. Even die hard Ritchie fans will admit he hasn't always been hitting it out of the park in recent years, but this story feels comfortingly familiar (think Snatch) without being just a rehash. The ""single malt and wagyu"" privileged sensibilities will rub some the wrong way, and it walks a line with some very un-woke humour, but if we can't laugh at ethnic stereotypes (including our own), we are much impoverished. I loved it.",The Gentlemen

629,wsawyer2,It gets even better the second time,8,26 November 2020,"I bought the DVD based on reviews that compared it to Snatch. The first time I watched it, I was already tired after a long day, and had some trouble following the storyline. But, I then watched it again, and the film made more sense, and it really drew me in. I suspect it will be even better the third or fourth time through. There is A LOT going on, with the typical Ritchie multiple sub-plots, and it is easy to miss important elements of plot development. In particular, the performances of Colin Farrell and Charlie Hunnam are quite engaging. Matthew McConaughey IS the protagonist, although he plays the role in a somewhat atypical (for him, and for a Guy Ritchie character), very low key manner. But, I found myself liking the character more and more as the film progressed.This is NOT Snatch, which is hilarious, and full of 'BIG personality' characters. The Gentlemen is more subtle, the characters more intricate and calculating. But, it is very enjoyable, in a different way than Snatch, or LS&TSB. It is well worth watching, several times, in fact.",The Gentlemen
630,paulblawrence,Waste of talent...,4,20 April 2020,"What was loved about Snatched was how every character, or group of characters not only are loved, but are all interconnected to the story. The story moves fast, and every actor fits their role perfectly.
The Gentlemen has none of that.
Matthew McConahay feels so out of place in his role, and in this film. As does every other actor in this film. While watching this, I found myself questioning why the story unfolds so slowly. The action is so few and far in between, that I started hoping the ending great climax, which it doesn't. The writing is just poorly done. While Snatch just felt fun, this movie doesn't, including a cringy but brief attempt of rape.
Overall, its a waste of time. There are several great actors in this movie, but they all feel out of place. The story isn't interesting, its poorly written and not worth watching.",The Gentlemen

635,cornerofspace,A Guy Ritchie Film,7,20 July 2021,"Having seen LS/Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, RocknRolla, and the new Sherlock Holmes films, I don't think there's a better description to describe The Gentlemen: it's a Guy Ritchie Film.Expect criminals with themes of betrayal, trust, greed, and pride, and a good ensemble cast with a web of intricated twists and somewhat convenient situations.The remarkable similarity between Ritchie's films is how he often portrays a sympathetic anti-hero who is clearly involved with all the illegal good stuff but there's something we root for despite his villainy. It's the inherent morality involved in his character. He might be killing people, breaking the law, but he has his principles. And he abides by them. He is charming, assertive, and most of all, he is adamant on smiting those that betrays him, and rewards those that honors his trust.But how he rewards the trust is very subtly displayed in film, if at all. It's never directly stated how much he trusts his henchmen, just the general comradery he displays with them. You also see Ray, his go-to henchman, is pretty well off financially. But you never really see just how intimate he trusts his henchmen. And that... is a Guy Ritchie film. Characters are often quirky, and it's interesting to see how they interact with other quirky characters, but it's a bit difficult to say you actually care about them. Rather than feeling like real people, they are caricatures and the vehicles to see how the plot unfolds, rather than the driver that pushes the plot forward.That is a subtle nuance, and one might argue it's simply a preference. And it is. There's nothing wrong with characters being pushed by the plot, than the other way around, but you do just end up caring less about them. I often don't remember anything about Guy Ritchie films, other than the unique style and my weak spot for having an ensemble cast.As a whole, the Gentlemen is entertaining, but I can see why there's an abundant of reviews here talking about how the critics are wrong and the audience loved it more. If you've seen his previous movies, as a critic, The Gentlemen will feel too similar, rather than a distinct story on its own. The general audience will find this a blast with its slick edits and dark humor.",The Gentlemen

637,alexreyn22,"Very enjoyable film throughout, but slightly disappointing ending",8,8 February 2021,"As a fan of many of Guy Ritchie's films, I was looking forward to seeing this one. With a strong line up of great acting talent that have been in numerous other great films I had high hopes and it started well.With much of the film told through the narration between Charlie Hunnam's (Raymond) and Hugh Grant's (Fletcher) characters helped the film flowed at a good pace and helped piece it together well. Fletcher was hilarious and made the film for me.In fairness most of the characters were great and it had an exciting mix. There were also many great and memorable scenes throughout that aided a good overall story.However, as enjoyable as it was throughout the ending was somewhat of a disappointment. Not because it was lacklustre or rushed, but because it was so overdone. There were numerous twist and turns and a slightly disturbing scene on a farm which were way over the top that by the end I'd slight lost track and wondered what had happened by the end.Overall if you are a Guy Ritchie fan like myself you will enjoy this film a lot, just might be a tad disappointed with the ending.",The Gentlemen

My rating 7.5/10",7,13 April 2020,"I have always loved the work of Guy Ritchie who directed Snatch, Sherlock holmes, Lock stock and two smoking barrels. but his recent movies we're disappointed, with this Movie he regained his throne to comedy/crime genre. This movie comes so close to snatch.It is really a fast-paced movie, although it has a predictable story the way Ritchie presented it makes us curious to see how this is going to unfold. The writing is magnificent. Really stylishly directed with quick dialogue, humor, and fast pacing script. If you saw his previous films you will know what I am talking about. A joy to watch from start to finish.The entire cast gave their best performance. Matthew Mcconaughey shined with his acting, dialogue. Best fitted role in his career. Rom-com king Hugh grant disappeared in this role of cunning, hilarious, long monologues just nailed it. Charlie hunnam has given his best performance of his career. Colin farrell with his charismatic and hilarious performance he changed the mood of the film into another level.I really liked the movie, if you're a person who is going to offended easily just skip this movie. It has a lot of profanity, a couple of racists jokes.

It's like a movie written by a 17yo fan-fiction wannabe.if someone else would have come with such a script, wouldn't have ever seen the lights of cinema, right? People are complaining it's 'too wordy', that's not a problem; if you like Tarkovsky, or Bergman, or so many other cinema giants, you know there's no such thing as 'too wordy'; but when the script is this poor that would not make it to straight2dvd - that's another issue entirely.Mr. Ritchie has some great stuff in the past; who knows, maybe his next project will be a bit closer to his own potential.Looks like this generation loves to live stuff just for the sake of loving them; nothing wrong with that.Anyway.Written by Mickey Mouse; for the Mickey Mouse generation.",The Gentlemen

He has managed to assemble an all-star cast and they all delivered in stellar fashion.

678,ReelVillain,The Real Rock'N'Rolla Returns,10,4 January 2020,"Guy Richie has been going through a somewhat renaissance of late, after 11 years away from the British crime genre he has finally had the faith to bring out a new adventure, but the reel question is will this drug-filled gangster flick have Layers to this Cake or be a total Snatch?I will be the first to admit, I didn't like Aladdin. I remember calling it ""the death of Disney"" I realise now that was wishful thinking. Disney is immortal. However, I can't dispute money and Aladdin made that, which is why most were surprised that it was announced that Richie's next venture (The Gentleman) was going to be something altogether more in keeping with his previous reputation.You can feel through the lens that Guy Richie is enjoying coming back to the fold, he uses every trick and joke to emphasis this. The entire premise of the film is that Fletcher (played by an outstandingly slimy Hugh Grant) is pitching his idea for a film to Raymond (Charlie Hunnam), something I am positive Guy Richie has done multiple times before. The story is complete with a reshoot of scenes (when Fletcher diverts too far from the truth) and even a comment about aspect rations for the picture. The title of Fletcher's film he wishes to make? ""Bush"". Something tells me that in a drawer in Guy Richie's house is the same title for Lock Stock and Two Smokin' Barrels.It's nice to see that Richie has learned something in the intervening years between the truly dreadful Revolver and today. Richie has learned how to keep current with both tone and characters while keeping the more classical aspects of the genre intact. It's as if he has wholesale lifted characters from The Long Good Friday and transported them to the new millennium to face some of the more unexpected issues around. There is a moment where Raymond is faced off with several youths carrying knives while trying to acquire a mobile phone with incriminating evidence on, an issue I'm positive Colin never had to consider.The characters have too evolved with the times as opposed to the usual cut and paste hard as nails men, we are given a wide variety of parts to invest in. The most notable 4 are Raymond, Fletcher, Micky and The Coach. Each of these acts are unique, Raymond, for example, has an obsessive-compulsive disorder or The Coach who trains street kids to be better men both inside and outside the ring. These are troupes we have not seen from Richie before, he has grown.What has also grown is Richie's ability to tell a story, while films like Lock Stock, Snatch and even Rock'n'Rolla still stand up, you never realised how limited Richie's abilities were until they are highlighted by a movie like The Gentleman. In his previous work, it would be fair to say he is overly indulgent in a world he is clearly in love with. In The Gentleman, Richie chooses the high road giving us only flickers of the gangster underbelly while never letting up on the violence.The Gentleman is the perfect tonic of comedy, surprises, and outstanding acting. Like a good malt, Richie had to go through a few barrels first.10 Weeds out of 10",The Gentlemen

680,ifrancetic,Couldn't wait for the end,6,28 March 2020,"Seen the movie and the reviews (all ranging from 8-10). Obviously this resonates well with the taste of the audiences, but I find it sad in comparison to Snatch, and Lock, stock. Those movies had better humor, suspense and acting than The Gentelman (with few honourable exemptions), and after 20 years all Guy did was a bleek copy. The plot is un-inspired, childishly inconvincing, and Mathew's character simply can't make it foat.
Even the sterotypes in the old movies were exploited in a funny way, bit in this one they are simply worn out or straight out racist.
6 stars is still border line watchable but I am disapointed that it gets all that praise from the viewers.",The Gentlemen
681,angus-clan,Gangsta Love Actually,6,20 January 2020,"OK so the plot is cool. The dialogue is cool. It is all entertaining enough : the characters are well formed and the action is fast paced. One of Ritchie strengths is that he doesn't hold back on the side characters. Even the non key players are well rounded and intruiging.What let's this movie down, in one word, is Grant. I disagree with other comments. His performance is not inspired nor spot on. It is 'East end gangster character 101'.Growing a goatee and saying a few naughty words doth not a convincing East End character make and adopting a stereotypical effeminate lisp and making a few risqué bottom jokes doth not a convincing homosrxual character make. Grant assumes both.A shame as his role is pivotal. Had it been played differently then the film could well have been recieved differently.",The Gentlemen

It's nothing against the cast or crew of the film, I just didn't have a desire to see this film. But I will say I really really enjoyed this movie! It's not perfect but it is definitely a good time!It's really hard to talk about the movie without spoilers but I will try my best.
I really love the way the story is told in the film, they do something pretty clever that keeps this movie fresh and keeps you guessing throughout the film! I also really appreciate that the movie doesn't rely on action and explosions to be interesting like so many films in this genre often do. There is actually a lot of dialogue and character building. But when the movie does have action they do it very well.My biggest compliant of the movie is the first act. I was very confused during most of the first act and was a little bored by the pacing of the first act. But as the movie goes on it gets better and better.

692,nicholasabadzis,Latest Ritchieflick is half-amusing SHOCK. (We're being generous),3,13 April 2020,"Watching Matthew McConaughey attempting to keep up with the talent in this latest Ritchieflick (the director who has to have his own sub-genre) is entertaining in itself. McConaughey mistakenly brings his usual earnest acting style to a world that's as real a depiction of the Brit underworld as The Magic Roundabout is of a midsummer's fete in The Wicker Man.As usual, Guy has bought in top artistes such as Hugh Grant, Michelle Dockery, Colin Farrell, Jeremy Strong and similar to convey the deeply wrought characters in his latest Carry-On-Gangsta fairy tale.Thing is, there's no such thing as a good or bad Ritchieflick - you can't really compare him to other filmmakers because, as previously noted, he's all his own thing. You can tell he wants to be a Tarantino or Scorsese, but unlike those auteurs, he swims in a rather more shallow pool of human behaviour, that inhabited by a kind of watery species of cliche. There are so, so many, but here's an example: Ritchie graciously takes the time to have Farrell's character mansplain certain racist terms for the viewer, so if you happen to be black and someone calls you a black c***, there's no need to feel offended. Glad that's sorted then. Has anyone told the rest of the world?Honestly? It's a fun hatewatch, silly without ever being wretched or (god forbid) too serious, but there are so many other filmmakers out there who really do deserve your attention and hard-earned. Taken on its own terms, it's the usual hilariously puerile piece of dog s#!*% - well put together and turned out, like a spotty teen wearing his dad's expensive suit and attempting to fill it out by puffing up his chest. Except this teen will likely never grow up - he'll just carry on making this kind of stunted fare. He thinks it's stylish, and maybe it is, if someone else is doing it.

Some ideas?
Very good play of actors, graphics, music.The suspense was at a high level, kept me on my chair waiting for the next scene.A small detail - I liked that in this movie when someone doesn't pay attention 100% something bad happens. If you're not engaged, you pay for this.The movie was, to me, not as smart as ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998), as it was more complicated and harder to understand. Also, I really liked Brad Pitt in ""Snatch"" (2000) In here, I wasn't attached to any character.The only downside? It was a purely, 100%, totally, and a bit :)) absolutely logical movie. There were emotions in the movie, actors were living and immersing in it, the script and play had suspense, but other than making me laugh one time, I didn't have any other emotion.I give the movie a grade of 10, with the disappointment of emotions.",The Gentlemen

Nice to have a different spin from previous films of his, and some of the actors play against usual roles to shine in another way.I simply can't get enough of the way Ritchie intertwines reveal different stories into one seamless plot, no matter whether it's Lock Stock, Snatch, RockNRolla, or this film, he never disappoints in this genre.I don't need to break down the plot for you, I can only assume you will want to see the film in all its glory, and i promise you, you will enjoy it.

The Gentlemen is a return to that crime/black comedy that Ritchie is known for, although I probably wouldn't class this as much as a black comedy like his previous films, but it is definitely a cool, suave gangster flick. The cast couldn't have been more perfect, Matthew McConaughey is brilliant as the lead, and the other actors, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell and Michelle Rockery (yes from Downton Abbey) are all superb and entertaining in their roles.

Guy Ritchie wrote the scripts for Revolver, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, just to mention a few and now you're beginning to have an idea of what The Gentlemen is all about. Not only that, it's ten times better. You'll never guess the end and that's the beauty of the movie. Let's not forget that Guy Ritchie also directed those 3 movies I mentioned as well as The Gentlemen.
Oh boy, is this fun!? Ups, sorry, I was about to forget RocknRolla. Another gem. But back to The Gentlemen. It's nothing personal, it's strictly business ... but never try to con a con artist. There's no such thing as honor among thieves and in this case is a business transaction gone bad 'cause one of the parts got greedy.
The actors: Matthew McConaughey and Hugh Grant are great. Colin Farrell steals the scene every time he appears. Michelle Dockery had me drooling all the time, ... she's had me doing it since Downton Abbey. Eddie Marsan is in one of those typical roles as made specially for him.

From Paddington 2 to this; he's versatile!Excellent editing strengthens the tale told and kept me intrigued enough as the usual Ritchie masterclass in a twisting and turning plot unfolds.Formulaic? Well, maybe, but the formula works. It's a geezers' playground of hazardous rides.Nice to see so many familiar faces and each service the screenplay to make a very creditable return to what Ritchie does best.

A rich cannabis grower / distributor wants to get out of the game. He tries to sell his business to a dude. The dude is a dick and tries to secretly devalue his business. A weird reporter guy likes to spy on the mobster guy (and his trusty ultra-violent but dapper af sidekick). He want to use this to blackmail them for a lot of money. This is where the entertainment is. The sidekick guy is a badass. The reporter is witty, and annoying in a very endearing way. The sidekick guy's reaction to the reporter guy's story telling is actually extremely well done. They really do an extremely good job of acting the part of badass witty uk gangsters (as all of Guy Ritchie's characters seem to be). So yeah if you like these movies, you will like this one. It's not the best, it's not the worst, but it is good and bad for the same reasons that all of his movies are good and bad. You will laugh. You will cringe. You will wince.

( One of his most underrated movies if you ask me. And please don't bring up Aladdin that just had Guy Ritchie flavor, but was very much Disney's movie.) I actually didn't realize that The Gentlemen was a Guy Ritchie film until the opening credits and the movie started rolling. Because once the movie starts you know it's a Guy Ritchie movie. No doubts.At first I was a bit put off. Jumpy, jarring, and then click. The story gets it's footing.The main reason I picked up The Gentlemen was the cast. With some of my all time favorite actors and (sadly) only one favorite actress. (It's very female lacking overall.) Everyone was amazing and I kept thinking ""Oh, well *insert name* just stole the show! Oh, wait now they stole the show!"" I came for Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant, and Charlie Hunnam. And wow, were they amazing!! Especially since the entire cast was, well, amazing! I did not know that the fabulous Michelle Dockery would be in this and she killed it! I feel ashamed of all the movies I've seen her in that just WASTED her skills. I want her to be in more fierce roles like this! Michelle Dockery is a true talent and I hate to see her skilled wasted. I wanted more of her character and loved every moment she was on screen!Once the movie gets going and the viewer ""clicks"" with it, the story is rather brilliant. I love all the tie ins from start to finish and the pay offs. Not to mention the themes. I don't want to give anything away. There's plenty of mystery, suspense, and dark humor that I just love!! Shocking deaths and viewers can definitely feel like every character's life is on the line.One of my favorite movies from 2019 and I wish there was more buzz around it! Not to mention for Hugh, Colin, Hunnam, and Michelle Dockery. Of course the ""star"" Matthew McConaughey (at least the face of the movie) was stellar as usual. I also think this shows another diverse side of Henry Golding who is really curating a solid portfolio of characters and skills. The script also shows it's all about the ideas and writing behind it.

It has nodes of Lock, Stock and the dialogue of this movie does not cater to the dull minded. Hugh Grant is brilliant and I was hanging on his every word. This movie is a fitting come back for Guy whose last few movies have been pretty dismal. I loved this and would love to see at the drive in as the fun would look great on a big screen. I highly recommend this movie if you like wit, action and an all round good time. Well Done!!!",The Gentlemen

729,porki_smile1,Really good one!,10,22 April 2020,"The movie is great. Even if we put aside how gorgeous Matthew Mcconaughey is, and the great performance of Matthew and Charlie Hunnam the movie itself is really good one. Different from the rest of the movies coming out last few years. Definitely relaxing, with really special way of introducing the story , just the beautiful way only Guy Ritchie knows.
The cast is just perfect, so many handsome men and talented actors i haven't seen in a movie in a while.
Just loved it!",The Gentlemen
730,luis_neiva,Is Guy Ritchie back?,7,31 March 2020,"Guy Ritchie started his career with a bang: ""Lock, stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998) and ""Snatch"" (2000) defined a genre and solidified a very unique style of doing British gangster films. They were messier, faster and bolder than their American counterparts but still powered with great scripts and powerful performances.
It also created a faithful legion of fans who loved Richie's first two features enough to disregard a streak of subpar films after that and still keep looking forward to any new film he put out.Being one of those fans, my expectations to ""The Gentlemen"" were still high and I sat down expecting to watch a true Guy Ritchie film, if not as good as the first two hits, at least something that could make them justice. After all, he was finally returning to the gangster genre and that was enough of a promise.I wasn't left disappointed. The film brought back many of his traits he had seemed to forgot how to use, presenting at the same time a more mature and cleaner style.
I didn't have as much fun as with Snatch, but I felt entertained and at times drawn to that magic and filthy universe filled with violence, quirky characters, and politically incorrect racial and homophobic slurs - it's clear these are not ill intended, it's simply the world where this characters live in.Grant, McConaughey and Hunnam convincingly exchange jabs at each other, making the most of a very tongue in cheek script with some well directed moments of drama and a few well timed twists. There are also some minor but interesting perfomances by Collin Farrell and Michelle Dockery who seem to be well positioned to have a lot more screening time in any eventual sequel this might have.It's very satisfying to see Guy Ritchie closer to his prime! May he not lose the balance again.",The Gentlemen
731,Richard-Palace-248-37158,Slick and gripping,7,13 March 2020,Very fun characters. A thunderously entertaining script. The film flies at a rapid pace and is satisfyingly 'in your face'.,The Gentlemen

Like back in times where Ritchie directed ""Snatch"" or ""Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels"" this movie is entertaining in so many ways. It is funny, it is bloody and it is weird (just as you know him from his later movies). The dialogues are also just as awesome as the world-building Ritchie does.

I throughly enjoyed watching things unfold throughout the film with an ending that keeps you on your toes just trying to keep up with how it's all going to end. I found it very refreshing to watch something different and original, unlike all the latest remakes and sequels, so I definitely recommend it if you're looking for something different and entertaining to watch.",The Gentlemen

Some corny yet well-done callouts appear on screen from time to time and add a slice of humor to an otherwise mostly serious story. The non-linear presentation of the events that unfold adds a healthy dose of mystery, and Hugh Grant is excellent as a sometimes-unreliable narrator. Every character is interesting in their own right, but Colin Farrell and McConnaughey are absolute standouts.",The Gentlemen
741,nblankfort,Weird movie,7,28 January 2020,The cast is great and the acting is too. However the story is hard to follow. Although I enjoyed watching it when I could figure out what was actually going on I didn't appreciate the gratuitous bestiality and attempted rape scenes.,The Gentlemen

The only difference here is that, in the main, the actors are already well established names, but Guy gives them a different angle which is to everyone's credit and makes the whole thing fresh and inventive. That said, for me the stand out was Colin Farrell - just brilliant.Personally, I don't think there will ever be another film made as great as Snatch, but this is very close - you won't be disappointed.",The Gentlemen

746,jmduffy1,Outstanding,10,3 April 2021,Saw this on Showtime. You know a movie is good when you want it paused for a bathroom break. All the actors were wonderful and I don't usually like Hugh Grant. I don't understand the people that didn't like it but I didn't like Wonder Women so we all have different tastes. This was a good story and really deserved an Oscar nomination. It won't get it in our absurd brittle PC environment though. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture.,The Gentlemen

There are great performances as you would expect from a Ritchie film- the standouts are Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant who are worth the ticket alone. The story line is also fantastic and keeps you guessing from start to finish. You may get a strong urge for a wagyu steak and whiskey afterwards.

761,Pritchie45,Authentic Simple Classic,10,15 October 2020,"I love a movie that has a music video in the middle of it (pink panther) and is oozing with culture. Living upto its title the movie showcases the various aspects that make up a gentleman. Virtues such as courage and loyalty even though the subject matter revolves around drugs.The format of the movie is creative with performances that transforms actors to memorable characters. The movie is a swift 2 hours long and easy to follow. When people look for representation in film they look for melanin, genitals and what genitals people are attracted to. I don't mind a movie with that in mind every so often but these have become boxes people seek to check. Instead here you will find riverly between jewish, american, and asian drug dealers. I love a movie that doesn't shy away from using a characters background as a way to insult them. The most creativity is in the writing.There are so many twists but just like a great rollercoaster none of them make you feel sick as the ride goes on. The writing of the movie slows you down and then speeds right up giving you a moment to breath before the movie continues. This movie is good you'll want to wait in line to ride it again.",The Gentlemen
762,jsmiemans-15452,"Jep, it's definitely a Guy Ritchie film",8,27 March 2020,"After Guy Ritchie's somewhat disappointing foray into the medieval fantasy genre, with his 2017 box office disaster ""King Arthur: Legen of the Sword"", Ritchie returns to form with the type of lighthearted British crime-comedy which made him a household name some twenty-odd years ago.
Yes, the plot of The Gentleman can feel a little meandering at times, mostly due to the fact that we as an audience are hearing most of the story told through an unreliable narrator. And yes, there are moments where ""style over substance"" takes over and it all seems a bit excessive.
But if you've enjoyed watching a Guy Ritchie movie before, these things won't surprise you and chances are you will certainly enjoy his latest work. The writing isn't quite as brilliantly snappy as some of his earlier films, and since the film does bear a lot of resemblance to Snatch in a lot of ways it's easy to draw that comparison. But in a landscape where Hollywood is pumping out mindless, unoriginal garbage at an unprecedented rate, I was just pleased that people are still making movies like these for me to enjoy.
The acting is good. You can clearly tell McConaughey, Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell had a lot of fun with their roles, which sets a nice tone for the entire film, off-setting some of the more brutal aspects of the world of crime it takes places in.
There's plenty of laughs, double/triple-crosses, British gangsters being British gangsters. It's the complete Guy Richie package I've come to known and enjoy over the years.
I would definitely recommend this one to any fan of the genre, as well as to those who aren't.",The Gentlemen

There is no point in even reviewing this movie. Have you seen anything Guy Ritchie has ever done? Ok, there ya go. If not, then it will be enjoyable. His schtick was great around the turn of the millennium, but it is so played out. I do want to give a shout out to Charlie Hunnam as Ray. He gave an enjoyable performance.",The Gentlemen

My only problem was with the dialogue, I didn't like the little quotes they had, the little metaphors, it just wasn't for me. The use of cgi bugged me, there was no need for it.

Bragging about who has the bigger sausage or how a gentleman pays his debts. Not much of a story telling, even less action. Reading hyped reviews even makes me to have a bitter view on the movie.It is good maybe after an exhausting day, or when you want to watch something that does not make you think. You just want to see glance, or how Mr. Ritchie depict the crime society. But still boring.However it was good to see Hugh Grant in another perspective and in my view the movie had potential. Hope the next one will be better with more 'artistic' sweat and creativity.",The Gentlemen
801,bumpgirl56,How many...,9,7 June 2021,"How many times can you say the 'c' word in one movie? I didn't count. How many different nicknames are there for 'marijuana'? I don't know. How many fabulous looking guys can overshadow the gorgeous STAR of the movie in glasses, beards, and slicked-back hair? Can you say Charlie Hunnam, Colin Farrell, and possibly even Hugh Grant? The story was impressive - I love something different. It would have been much less so without the right actors. They nailed the casting. Even the diva (Roz) would have been so much less interesting in the part if she was any better looking (although it took watching it a second time for me to figure this out). GOOD FLICK. I wonder if Marn Davies would be amenable to writing an entire movie about this Colin Farrell character - it would be glorious!",The Gentlemen
802,rjwcs,The Guy Ritchie Formula,8,28 March 2020,"The Gentlemen is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. Not a moment of boredom through the long dialog narration, thanks to the trademark Guy Ritchie school of editing. His ability to make all characters have the depth of a main character is matched by few others.
In The Gentleman the focus in more on intellect and less on raw violence (though present). The plot Is direct and incisive, keeping you alert without overwhelming you with too much information to follow. An easy mistake to do in these plot twist based movies, but that The Gentlemen tiptoes around with mastery.
That being said, the story feels straight out of the Guy Ritchie turn lever machine. While it has its unique twists and turns, they feel reused, and for those of us that have seen his previous movies, the omnipresent sense of ""dejá vu"" is there detracting from what is otherwise a well constructed plot.
For me to rate Snatch as his masterpiece, I have to rate this one at an 8, pulling on 7 for those that are not fans of the style.",The Gentlemen

807,carlitobraggante,Tried to hard and failed.,5,23 July 2020,"I was disappointed with this film, felt Guy Ritchie was trying to replicate his old classics, Snatch and Lock Stock. Two great films in there day, but there day has gone,felt the casting for the actors was poor. Charlie Hunnam, good enough actor but not in this role, Matthew McConnaghy very good actor fairly convincing, Hugh grant was amusing, but the humour felt forced, try another type of film Guy, something a bit more grittier. Hey just my opinion.",The Gentlemen

809,seanto,Gangsters you'll fall in love with.,9,11 January 2021,"Where do I even start with how much I loved this film. I loved the way they told the narrative through two people in a posh house. Thought that was really clever and gave insight into the characters by having them know the other characters in the film. Felt quite clever at times and I'd love to see more films that play out like this. I also loved all of the action, comedy and drama that came with the film. I think I'm starting to develop a love for films like this as I also love The Kingsman series which this felt similar too in my opinion.The only reason I couldn't give it 10 stars was due to moments in which it jumped about. There were a few moments where one minute I thought something had happened and then the next minute they were saying it didn't happen like that it happened like this instead. Made it a bit hard to follow in places. Having said that I would happily watch this film again and can't wait to see what comes next in this series.",The Gentlemen

817,dementedoracle,"Not bad, but not as entertaining as the trailer and high ratings seemed to suggest",6,10 February 2020,"There's nothing offensively bad about this movie, but its entertainment value is incredibly subjective. There's just a lot of time spent on either exposition or conversations where nothing actually gets accomplished to move the plot forward. It's then left to the strength of the actors and actresses and the writing of the characters to hold the audience's attention throughout the scenes. Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant, and Michelle Dockery were more than capable of consistently carrying this burden, but the rest of the cast and the writing seemed to get tired at times.Overall, watching this movie is a little like watching Guy Ritchie. If you really love Guy Ritchie it's quite the special treat, but otherwise not a very rewarding use of your time.",The Gentlemen

819,gordon-meadows,So polished you almost forget you're watching Ritchie,8,24 March 2021,"All the characters and their machinations are so entertaining to watch unfold you don't even care if it's predictable or not. My fav was Colin Farrell.Ritchie just has a way with creating such rich and lovely characters who live on the periphery of his films and I think 3/4 of that is the talent he has for picking the right people who will be able to fulfill those tangential but important roles. Same with the leads. Same with the supporting.For me, it wasn't very predictable... I mean you knew because it's Ritchie that SOMETHING was going to happen but I try to watch movies in a null mind state. I try to not guess and not figure it out so I can enjoy the director's and the writer's intention as it's meant to be. Sometimes it's hard to do.But watching this movie was like eating a giant bowl of kids cereal. I know it's not the best meal I've ever made... but it's as comfy as I'm gonna get, I knew I was going to have fun, and boy it sure did taste good.Happy viewing.",The Gentlemen
820,barkinunluer,A MODERN GUY RITCHIE CLASSIC,7,3 January 2021,"As we know very well, Guy Ritchie has his own way of storytelling which always includes guns, drugs and a lot of action for sure. In this movie, he continues his tradition with an incredible male-leading cast.The movie has not a curious or thought-provoking plot just like all Ritchie movies but there's always really quality time in terms of entertainment.The cast is absolutely brilliant: McConaughey is always himself with his typical charming attitude and Texan accent. Charlie Hunham just looks like he got out from a Sons of Anarchy set. Besides, Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell is absolutely hilarious as hell.The storytelling is a quite Ritchie style, has a complex structure but not deep, just as he always did in his every movie.In general, i really recommend this movie if you are just looking for have some fun, not for some more.",The Gentlemen

I really enjoyed this movie, it was a fun ride with strong dialogue, great characters and memorable moments. It was my first Guy Ritchie film but I could certainly sense a unique style. This film doesn't ""reinvent the wheel"" or do anything revolutionary when it comes to crime films but it is a solid film and fun ride nonetheless.",The Gentlemen
837,turnerholdingsllc,Unforgettable,10,1 February 2020,"Guy Richie comes back to the British crime thriller theme in this film and he does so in a modern tone. Like Snatch the characters collide in an epic, and to many, comic climax that's pleasing. In this case the Characters are as unique as the characters in Snatch. The acting is top Notch, especially Collin Farrow, Hugh Grant and Michelle Dockery. Matthew Mcconaughey is Matthew Mcconaughey like in the Lincoln commercials. This movie ,like Snatch, is memorable and very re-watchable. Its not as sharp and politically incorrect like Snatch was, but I believe that this is done on purpose to reflect the times and is actually a theme in the movie between Millennial Drug dealers and Gen-X Drug dealers and to me its quite comical. Apparently the politically correct Critic scores do not like it. Its a Great movie its a classic you will enjoy it.",The Gentlemen
838,philippe-42643,What's not to like about this movie?,8,7 January 2021,"It's probably the best movie EVER for Hugh Grant. He's funny, ad rem and develops his character as a likeable yet annoying and condescending nosy neighbour. Great performance! Then comes Colin Farrell - just superb. Dry and witty. And adds so much character to the movie. And Matthew and Charlie to tie it all together. What a great cast for this movie that is a must watch.It reminded me of the atmosphere in Lock Stock and Two sb and I had to think for a minute, but to be honest, I'm liking this one more now. It has replaced LS&2SB in my list of classics, as I'm sure this one will become one to remember and rewatch.",The Gentlemen

The violence was a lot and trigger warning regarding sexual assault. The soundtrack is outstanding and I love The Toddlers (lol) and their rap and dance moves. Michele Dockery is elegant and fierce af. Hugh Grant looks completely different and is more interesting here than in The Undoing. Matthew McConnaughy (sp?) is very good and co-produced. Charlie Hunnman is lovely to watch. The brutality and violence is rough to watch. The UK take was refreshing and fun. The accents and Brit slang are great.

863,trust-me1,Pure entertainment and better than anything I've seen in the last 5 years,10,11 August 2020,"I finally made an account just to review this movie. Honestly, this movie is proof why you should never, ever rely on critics as they're worse paid actors than anything you'd find in even the worst movies.The Gentlemen is quite frankly pure entertainment and a rare glimpse at how engaging good storytelling and convincing acting can be.In short, it is a slow burning half 'who-dunnit' half 'is-anyone-gonna-do-it?' flick in the typical prose of Guy Ritchie. The only thing I wish to add, having seen all of Guy's films is that he has well and truly come into his own here. Whilst so many directors, like Tarantino just re-use the same gags and tricks for shock value, Mr. Ritchie has proven that he isn't an old dog that can't learn new tricks and that he hasn't been asleep during the cultural shift of the last decade.The Gentlemen is a fantastic fusion of modern Britain, technology, culture (if you can call it that at this stage haha) and old school die-hard gangster/mobster vibes.There isn't a single weak performance, so you'll have yourself laughing and gasping so often that you'll need to pause and rewind this great flick. We don't deserve actors like Matthew Mcconaughey and love him or hate him but Colin Farrel does one hell of a role in this film so it's time to get off his back for that Telephone movie he did over a decade ago.Just watch this movie and stop reading reviews, you could do so much worse. If you don't like this style, then I do kind of pity you and I wish you the best with what-ever Marvel releases in the future.I really hope we get a sequel.",The Gentlemen

The script was an absolute delight with some of the best dialogue I have heard in a very long time, delivered to perfection by all the main cast. It's a delight having a director and writer like Guy to keep the movie industry fresh, we need more original content like this being rewarded for originality.The cast, well Hugh Grant was fantastic, you quickly realise Grants been underused in films, he has range and this shines through. Colin Farrell too was an absolute standout when on screen, he stole the scenes and had me in stitches.

871,helloheather30,"Original, entertaining, packed with hilarious gems!",9,8 January 2020,"This film showcases Guy Ritchie's individuality through and through and he doesn't disappoint. Eccentric characters, plot twists and action, interjected with subtle or hilarious conversations. The lesser roles of Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell are superbly acted and larger than life, against the more conventional leads of Matthew Mcconaughey and Charlie HunnamIt was great to witness so many cinema goers roaring with laughter.Absorbing story telling is mixed with modern, fast paced, cinematic tricks, music and colour.Refreshing and original . A total blast!",The Gentlemen
872,rainbowzs,Hugh Grant is amazing,8,25 June 2020,Fun film! I was greatly impressed with Hugh Grant's performance. Had to do a double take when he first appeared on the screen. Colin Farrell was a scene stealer and Michelle Dockery makes a great mob wife.,The Gentlemen

875,waydor,Bit clunky!,6,11 January 2020,"This is a typical Guy Ritchie film. Plenty of action, deaths, bad language and occasional laughs. Some of the scenes are Pulp Fiction-esque. There's not a lot new here, but the film moves along quite nicely. Not overly keen on the storytelling format of the film, and Hugh Grant goes on a bit too much. Matthew Mcconaughey is well cast, Colin Farrell steals the show and will probably win some awards for his performance. Some poor script writing at times, but overall well worth a watch.",The Gentlemen
876,Gorilla_Warrior,Instant Classic,10,4 April 2020,"This is easily one of my favorite films. The action, flashbacks, and possibilities of each scene kept me on my toes. The Visual Effects deserve an award. The cast is superb and the way Guy Ritchie utilized their talents and mixed the actors in different scenes allowed almost everyone to work together in one way or another on set. This helped to showcase the depth of the individual actors while creating a cinematic masterpiece for those who love crime films especially, but also for those who do not. The dry humor and wit add an entirely different element not usually associated with this type of crime genre. Any critic that bashed or had anything negative to say about this film needs to get into a different career. Don't listen to them; watch it for yourself or you're missing out on a classic film. I was actually sad when it ended because it was so amazing and refreshing. I can't say enough about it and I hope it will inspire other film companies, writers, directors, and actors to do something similar in the future because we need more movies with the storytelling and passion that this classic brought to the audience.",The Gentlemen

The dialog is delivered tough and hard-line until the recipient has had enough and takes charge of the situation. Hugh Grant (Fletcher) has observed this bunch of outlaws from afar, then with that knowledge puts it in script form and confronts them to extort many multi millions to enrich himself. Ritchie is a filmmaker so the script form figures as does the many references to movie pop culture seeps into the dialog.

I don't care if the critics think Guy Ritchie is re-using the same plot, if you're able to make it as surprising, fun and different every time, that's a talent in itself. Matthew Mcconaughey was a delight but I have to say Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell were by far my favourite in this film.

911,mateus-74753,Reference Sickboy,5,3 February 2020,"I need to preface the following, by stating that I like Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell, Charlie Hunnam, Henry Golding and Guy Ritchie is a BJJ Black Belt. I also own Snatch, and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. That being said, the movie was an empty suit, a hollow shell. It was completely void of the humor one comes to expect from Guy Ritchie or the convoluted intersecting plot lines that come together in the end. The femme fatale had zero sex appeal. Zero fun. I realize this is anecdotal evidence, but people walked out. As a fly on the wall, in the restroom taking a leak, the sentiment was similar. Not sure how it is 8.1. The masses know very little. I'm already making allowances for one of the two most trite, formulaic genres, the gangster flick. I'm reminded of Sickboy's pearl of wisdom in Trainspotting. The first one, as I don't recognize the abortion of a sequel. ""It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life. What do you mean? Well, at one time you've got it, then you lose it and it's gone forever. All walks of life..... "" All I'm trying to do Mark, is to help you understand that The Name Of The Rose is merely a blip in an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory."" Guy Ritchie also shits on Coppola's masterpiece, The Conversation. An original idea which illustrates the paramount importance of intonation. Nearly 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Leave it out mate.",The Gentlemen
912,cjjsjr,Ok movie,7,2 February 2020,"If you liked ""Pulp Fiction"" you will like ""The Gentleman."" It is a similar CrimeCom but with a British accent. Need more help deciding, read on.McConaughey gives a memorable performance that can make you at times uncomfortable, yet never makes the type of connection where you want to cheer for his character. Not his fault, likely more due to mediocre script and direction. ""The Gentleman"" struggles between deciding whether to be a comedy or a drama.The plot is contrived, at times beyond belief, but the acting, Cinematography and editing keep the story watchable.If you have a reason to go, like you never miss a Macounaughy movie, you will likely be glad you see this movie.

Guy Ritchie knows how to contrast the two ends of British society: the Toffs and the Crooks because both view the world in the same way - to be ripped off.

Ritchie has an ear for their absurd language - it is hilarious; best verbal comedy any where - a bit crude but OK in this context. Plot filled with irony and flips.",The Gentlemen

The plot and dialogue are really fantastic. The characters, casting and acting could not be better and the soundtrack is very original. You can't half watch it though or you will lose the plot very quickly. This is one film best appreciated on the big screen but that's not been an option of late. Sit down, put down your phone, turn down the lights and take it in. I think it's Godfather II quality with plenty of dark humor added. If you don't like it so much the first time give it another look. You'll appreciate it more the second time. If you're not a Brit you might need to look up some slang terms like ""toff"".

933,phtynth,Feels like a movie trying to act cool instead of tell a good story,3,2 February 2021,"This whole movie just feels like a power play. The characters have no other personality other than the one-dimensional characteristic of ""I'm better than you."" They are the typical cigar-and-gun-lovers trope. They swear without purpose; they just want to be seen as intimidating without proving much of any point. Don't get me wrong, I love a good classy/gentleman character if done well, just like in the Bond movies for example, but this is NOT it. The characters walk and act like cheap imitations of so-called classy gentlemen but without any complex emotions or truly deep backstories.And because these characters were so cliche and one-dimensional, the story was ruined. Usually, a good story line is propelled due to some intense moral dilemma or some higher purpose, but no. There was none of that, the plot was secondary; the whole purpose of the film was just to show how ""cool"" the characters are.I watched this movie in theatres and it was literally the first film I had to walk out of. I made it maybe 3/4 through the movie and it felt like there was no cathartic reveal or fight or anything, just pure power play. I doubt that the end of the movie would've made me feel any better. I love good movies and usually I go through a whole range of emotions throughout the movie, but I got no emotions during this one. It's a no from me.",The Gentlemen

Now, twenty years on, you call all of those people that you shared the lock-stock-and-two-smoking-barrels party with and organize another party. Now though, its in somebody's backyard. Its boozy, and maybe even fun. But its not lock-stock-and-two-smoking-barrels. Everybody still looks OK, just larger than you remembered and with money.

I have seen movies in the past that I think are far worse than the average rating here is, but this film is the one with the most extreme deviation. Is there somone making jokes and faked the ratings? As I am now writing this review, I am still surprised about that discrepancy. An I am surprised that well known actors, that I usually think the can act, have gotten into this movie. What did they like about it so that they joined that experiment?

950,Ndetzzz,A good film to start the decade,7,1 January 2020,"The Gentlemen marks the return of Guy Ritchie to comedy-crime genre, after almost a decade of absence. The screenplay was brilliantly written, with its witty dialogues ( mostly owing to Hugh Grant's extraordinary performance) and plot twists deserving the highest praise. Subjectively-speaking, the film's suspenseful atmosphere felt like that of Knives Out (2019), although The Gentlemen is more pacey and lighthearted.However, its lack of well-choreographed fight scenes, while not a major issue, can leave a feeling of incompleteness. Nevertheless, it is still a very enjoyable film that will start your New Year with a smile.Rating: 7.5",The Gentlemen

954,antonypavey,Guy Ritchie Back to his best!,10,21 July 2020,"I'm here on IMDB as i feel i must leave a review for this Film. This movie ranks along side Guy Ritchie's best. 'Lock Stock', 'Rock and Rolla' and 'Snatch' are amongst the best British movie's and 'The Gentlemen' slots in superbly amongst them. As with the aforementioned titles casting was key, and wow were the right choices made for this title. For me personally,the choosing of Matthew McConaughey was as clever as the choosing of Brad Pitt in 'Snatch'. Before watching I wasnt to sure with the casting but after seeing his performance wow! And having his Hollywood prowess working so well alongside Charlie ' Jax Teller ' Hunnam. As a hard core SOA fan seeing Charlie on screen is always a pleasure, ( and its a good job he wore glasses as without you can see why hes so typecast with Samcro ) and he pulled of the dry sarcastic side amazingly well too. From the story all the way through to the chosen soundtrack....this is a collection of amazing choices and more importantly performances. If you dont like this film....then do you actually watch films? Really struggle with any negativity at all.",The Gentlemen
955,eccentrickris,Laugh out loud funny and fantastic narrative,9,13 January 2020,"It is so refreshing to see not only something that is original out on our screens but also a welcome return for Guy Ritchie to take us into a gripping narrative within the british crime world.It's hard to believe RocknRolla was over ten years ago now and while Ritchie has delivered some wonderful films over that span of time, when I think of a Guy Ritchie film, The Gentlemen is the type of film I think of - and it did not fail to deliver.I truly believe that Matthew McConaughey is a brilliant actor and he absolutely delivers in this role 100%. What was a surprise for me was Hugh Grant. In an all star cast it's difficult to call out specific performances, as not one actor lets this film down.That said, Grant's performance in this film is something spectacular of it's self and should not go unnoticed.Overall this film is a classic Guy Ritchie style - if you like his films, you're going to like The Gentlemen. It will have you laughing out loud, gripped with an engaging narrative, and gasping at some of the violence (and again laughing at some of it).A must watch while out at the cinema. Go support original narratives - big or small budget, this is the stuff we want and need more of.",The Gentlemen
956,phnx0,"Guy Ritchie on FLYING Form, Amazing cast, Amazing performances, Amazing Movie",9,29 April 2020,"Amazing movie. I frequently laughed out loud at the dialogue. The direction is stellar.

957,alliohaha,Alas!,5,29 April 2020,"Well, I had high expectations, of course. And I didn't like the movie partially because of that. So, I'll try to forget for a minute that it's a Guy Ritchie movie and will just list the things that ruined it for me, but only those that would have done the same for any other film.
1. Narrating voice. That is a no-no. Few people manage to do it right. Unfortunately, this is not the case.
2. Main characters are too-cool-for-school, all-knowing, too powerfull and too lucky. It's simply not interesting. They don't have any vulnarabilities.
3. Guy Ritchie uses low blows manipulating viewer's emotions with the fake assassination at the beginning.
4. Characters seem to float in vacuum of space: a criminal organisation of only 2 people. There's no police or other government agencies. Characters out of touch with reality. A rapping and boxing gang of ninja turtles?
5. Stupid imaginary scenes.
6. The whole Fletcher line is useless. The movie would have work without it.I guess it boils down to a poorly written script.
Otherwise the movie is beautifully shot and has good music.",The Gentlemen

966,thebrothersbev,A true gentlemen is more FU than PC.,8,29 January 2020,"Two hours of bad men behaving as such. The Gentlemen is Guy Ritchie's The Irishman, so don't go into this steeped in mortality, anti-morality tale expecting Lock, Stock, RocknRolla, or especially Snatch because you will be disappointed. Admittedly, I went into this film anticipating a giddily in-your-face wild ride and initially did not know how to process what ended up being a surprisingly refined and mature bit of nastiness. However, I soon understood that even Guy Ritchie must grow old with the rest of us, which is something that he clearly understands as well. At face value, The Gentlemen appears devoid of sentimentality, but upon closer examination, one could argue that crime films don't get more sentimental. Honest either. It seems Ritchie, much like other seasoned auteurs, has reached that magical point in his career where he no longer caters to audiences, who are calling the film ""boring,"" or critics, who are attacking the film for being ""offensive."" I would argue that The Gentlemen is neither, but rather the cinematic equivalent to a man of a certain age. It moves at its own pace, no matter how painstaking, voices its own opinion, no matter how unpopular, and flaunts its own style, no matter how passé. While not without its flaws, specifically one or two moments of unnecessary convolution, The Gentlemen starts 2020 off strong and potentially marks the start of a bold new era for Guy Ritchie. Sure, it's sexist, racist, violent, dated, mean-spirited, and countless other shades of deplorable, but it is also genuine. It proves that a punch to the gut can come from the heart, and I find that endearingly charming, like an old dog peeing on the carpet. Truly, never has such an inappropriate film felt so appropriate. Oh and what a soundtrack! B",The Gentlemen

974,AlexandraaBuena,Don't think too much about the logistics of the movie but the story.,9,18 February 2020,"Twice now has Guy Ritchie amazed me. First Man from U.N.C.L.E. and now The Gentlemen. The title itself is ironic. Since none of them are really gentle...rather they dress and carry themselves as such.Can I just say Ray's relationship with his boss is the kind of loyalty I enjoyed seeing in this movie. They both have mutual respect and care for each other and you can see that when Ray talks to his boss and how Ray's house well...outdoor steak grill? The boss knows how to take care of his most trusted ""assistant?""Smart. With a few comedy scenes that takes a fast thinking mind to catch up.
More talking less action. Which was what I was expecting since I didn't perceive this movie as 'The Kingsman' type of movie.
At least I wasn't confused when Fletcher kept going back and forth from the past to explaining his story to Ray.Enter the cinema thinking like a detective who-dun-it?

975,ihaverly,Don't expect Lock Stock or Snatch,7,7 January 2020,"Guy Ritchie burst onto the scene making the innovative British gangster film Lock Stock & Two Smokin Barrels, following it up with almost as good Snatch & the under rated Rocknrolla before heading off to la la land to make Hollywood blockbusters.
Now he's back to his roots making a new British gangster film The Gentlemen but unfortunately he brought Charlie Hunnam with him who puts on an appauling accent.
Hunnam's accent drifts from English to Irish to American, if he can't do an accent then why not makes his character American like his boss or better still give the role to the brilliant Mark Strong who has such a small role in the film if you blinked you'd miss him?
Unlike Ritchie's counterpart Mathew Vaughan, who still makes innovative & stylish films , he seems to have been corrupted by Hollywood.
Where as Lock Stock, Snatch & Rocknrolla had style & humour The Gentlemen falls a bit flat. It's storyline is good with a few twists & turns but lacks the panache & punch of his early work.
Colin Farrell is brilliant in a type cast role, as is Hugh Grant in the complete opposite of his normal role as a camp investigator looking for a quick payday.
The rest of the cast are good with the exception of Hunnam's accent.
Although The Gentlemen overall is a good film it's certainly no Lock Stock or Snatch.",The Gentlemen

""i know something about you""
""oh yeah? and I know something worse about you""and now the definition of ""deus ex machina""
is a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem in a story is suddenly and abruptly resolved by an unexpected and unlikely occurrence. Its function can be to resolve an otherwise irresolvable plot situation, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a happy ending, or act as a comedic device.... and the criticism of the convenient machinations.

1013,allanjim3,Guy Ritchie - From Cutting Edge To Just Plain Dull,6,12 October 2020,"This really would've been a great, entertaining flick ten ... heck, maybe even seven years ago. But Mr. Ritchie's magic formula simply doesn't measure up in this case. Scenes which would've had a 'shock and awe' effect on the viewer once upon a time - now seem overdone to the point of being ridiculous and farcical.Despite the fact Matthew McConaughey is a highly talented and versatile actor, I just couldn't buy into his portrayal of a cold-blooded, murderous gangster. Once you're arrested playing bongo drums in the nude while high as a kite ... you should really think twice before taking on a role where the very mention of your name strikes fear into the hardest British gangsters and thugs.Mr. Ritchie was once a lean, hungry predator and it had a visceral effect upon his films. Now however, the pendulum has swung in a different direction and the effect it had upon this film is all too apparent.",The Gentlemen

1017,rayjaydizon,Star-studded cast with great storytelling,7,29 March 2020,The film has this spy-gangster story in a comedic tone with great dialogues and effective timing/editing. The cast is superb as well with McConaughey being great as always and Hunnam and Grant having great chemistry from top to finish. I think the best asset of the film is the way it was told - most of the scenes were narrated in a flashback fashion with perfect cuts of current scenes in between. Reminds me so much of Knives Out (another great film).,The Gentlemen

1030,pinkpassport,Great Characters - Hilarious Movie,9,25 April 2021,"I caught this movie half way through while channel surfing in a hotel. No channel guide so I had no idea what was on, no idea what movie this was or what it was about. But hearing the British accent made me stop surfing and watch.Typical British humor, totally irreverent, refreshingly devoid of beeps and censorship and full of hilarious one-liners. It had me hooked immediately so I watched it to the end. Then I googled movies with Matthew Mcconaughey and Henry Golding and only then did I find out the title. Hugh Grant was so good in it, playing against his usual role of affable upper class twit, that I didn't even realize it was him. Nor did I recognize Colin Farrell, who was also superb. So now that I know what it's called, I have watched it in its entirety and enjoyed it just as much again.Great cast, great plot (yes, there really is one, although a lot of it is shown as flashbacks), loads of twists and turns and classic one-liners. Don't understand all the negative reviews on here saying it's boring - maybe you need to be a Brit to understand some of the dialog - but I was thoroughly entertained for the 2 hours. Well done Guy Ritchie! This has now become one of my all-time faves.",The Gentlemen

1033,carolinewood-31685,Go see it twice .,9,4 January 2020,"Had a bit of trouble following it at first as I was distracted but the wits trying to open the chip packs for at least 10 mins.If this happened further into the movie I would have gotten into character and become an enforcer and banged a couple of heads together, as it was I controlled myself for once and kept my mouth closed.(Which is hard sometimes)
Don't see this movie if you don't like to hear the"" See U Next Tuesday""as there were a few.
Hugh Grant as the narrator ,Had to look twice as he'd nailed the cockney accent down pat ,almost thought that it had been dubbed .Mathew McConaughey played the Drug lord with a conscience who ONLY sells the wacky tabbacky ,no Heroin for this gangster.The chick from Downton Abbey Michelle Dockery was Mathews wife who also took the plum out of her mouth and ignored her elocution lessons .Wait for the assault scene on her in her office.The poms and their sick sense of humour shows brilliantly through the dead pan look on her face.
Did I mention the CeeUNextTuesday's that are sprinkled throughout the movie??? Again just a heads up.
Mister nice guy Henry Golding from Crazy rich Asians, was just creepy cause you know he is such a heart throb but then he opens his mouth with obscenities ,and he becomes an all round unlikable dude.
Charlie Hunnam as Mathews security detail is understated but a standout at the same time .Watch the scene where he is in the druggies den .He takes loyalty to new heights.
But to me the standout was Colin Farrell as the coach of the toddlers(picture Eggsie from The Kingsmen )He had some of the best lines especially in the Gym with the black dude, and the pig scene .PMSL.All said in his beautiful Irish accent.
Oh did I mention the plethora of Cee U Next Tuesday references .
Actually there were so many of them I nearly had to look up the cast list just to double check there wasn't a character named U. N .T.
(Hate that word by the way)
Full of great dialogue classic back to basics Guy Ritchie.
Look for the reference to one of Guy Richie's other movies in the last scene with the Harvey Weinstein look a like.Remember pay attention at the start cause it starts with flash backs but you dont realise it till Hugh starts to tell the story and what a story teller he is .Best performance since Love Actually(My opinion anyway,No English fop to be seen in this movie.
Worth seeing this a second time as I know I missed things .
4.9 out of 5 best movie of the year hahaha",The Gentlemen

The difference between this picture and Snatch is that Snatch is much more original with it's goofy characters and neat dialogues.",The Gentlemen

Constructed with a soundtrack to match the pace and tone of the movie, you're drawn into the ""now what?"" line of conscious that Richie is famous for.

1036,green_goddess-14686,Colin Farrell and Hugh Grant - fantastic,6,29 January 2020,"An entertaining yet predictable movie carried by Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell. The early scenes dragged because as clever as the dialogue was, Charlie Hunnam could not keep up with Hugh Grant's acting levels and it showed. A fun crime caper, nowhere near as mega or cheeky as Snatch. There were a couple of cheap jokes that we felt were borderline racist.",The Gentlemen
1037,mmkkelly,A quality story,8,26 January 2020,"This film has so much going for it. A great story with a phenomenal cast.
Hugh Grant plays a writer that is trying to blackmail Charlie Hunnam and Matthew McConaughey. Hugh has written a script that includes real life events. Some he feels are dead right, and some he feels he may have given some Hollywood finesse. The performances are superb. The writing by Guy Ritchie is outstanding. I would only change a few things (like the ""fight"" sequences).
A special shout out to Jeremy Strong. He plays the ""Vinnie"" character in ""The Big Short"" In this film he plays a homosexual thug. I forgot it was him at one point. Just unreal acting. Great job all around.",The Gentlemen

1039,yyero,"A boring if old fan, attempt at comedy in a criminal background",6,28 January 2020,"I have to say the latest British gangster film The Gentlemen from Guy Richie, so hyped, while more of a comedy and intendedly so was given an avg rating of 8/10. I give it a 6.0. Other than an all-star cast, which did their best given the writing (Colin Farrell, Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam etc.) the movie was such a bore, a sub par buildup of a literal narrator from the very start and if you have seen all of his previous films, a total rehash. Like an absurdly meh attempt at rehashing some Snatch with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels with a Triple-A cast that just..came of so weak. The action scenes were strong but extremely rare in the very short amount of time the movie takes place. Seriously it less then 2 hours long with like, *SPOILER ALERT* 3 action scenes are best that are even remotely interesting. Given movies like John Wick and The Equalizer, hell even The Irishman, this movie is like watching a soap opera..and not the good kind. This felt like a family friendly Snatch but with seriously less focus on actual acting. The entire film was basically a focus on the narrator, this was its largest weakness. The main characters of the entire movie came off as side characters while the narrator, who turns out to be a piece of crap who probably dies in the end *you are left wondering* gets all the screen time. This never happened in Snatch or Lock, Lon and Loaded in which the movie was narrated as it progressed by the main protagonist, it gave sorta of a safe feeling of hope that at least the story with end with him being alive, imprisoned or will continue on but he was a likable main protagonist, there is nothing of the sort in the one here. One is left wondering, why? Why such a boring narrator who is basically a bad guy, snitch and why such lack of real action criminal underworld scenes? This felt like a comedic take on the genre but like, childish given the cast. It is an insult to the actors, The Irishman actually was a real crime genre film, this does not deserve the title of gangster or crime at all. The audience laughed more than anything, it was more of a comedy than a gangster film which I think was the wrong direction.Before it felt like it was an actual crime film with comedic elements tying it all together but it was believable, terrifying and real. This movie came off as confused about which genre it was trying to pull more for. I seriously felt like I watched a Superbad for crime movies spoofing Guy Richie. Like if Guy Richie just spoofed himself with a lame copy/paste. There were some strong scenes, but overall, what a disappointment.
Could say more but then it would just be comparing it to Snatch and Lock, Stock and it wouldn't be fair to it...because in my opinion fails in every comparison.",The Gentlemen
1040,Ferdydurk,Entertaining and inconsequential,7,14 January 2021,"A the beginning, I feared that it would be another apology of gangster life like a Tarantino movie, perhaps something as dreadful as Legend (2015). But in fact it was just an entertaining trip through a mythical England full of lads, whisky and lords. What could have been a bore is finally a guilty pleasure, thanks to the cast, the pacing, the lack of obscene violence and, above all, because the film doesn't take itself too seriously. Liked it.",The Gentlemen

It's not bad, just kinda OVERRATED. My old man himself found the movie BORING, and that's coming from someone who likes gritty crime movies. This unfortunately didn't meet his standard (like Dirty Harry, The Godfather, The Untouchables, Good Fellas, Kill The Irishman, We Own The Night, etc..).Lots of Guy Ritchie fanboys are defending this really boring movie. What's so great about a movie filled with almost nothing but exposition this, and exposition that? The Godfather 1 & 2 and Good Fellas did such stuff way better. Many of the build ups in this movie get nowhere or take too long. There's hardly any action, and I even find the slow paced 1940's & 1950's Crime Noir movies far more engaging to watch.",The Gentlemen

1044,alisaadlerwl,"Tangled, Pompous, Droll",10,23 February 2020,"Have you killed someone?He was killed by the gravity.However, there are many jokes there. I won 't post them here so I don 't ruin pleasure. By the way, some jokes go beyond what is generally considered permissible in today 's civilized world. And if tolerance is your middle name, think twice whether to watch this movie, cause it may innervate.Humor is what makes all the main characters nice. And there 's not just one or two of them here. I counted seven, and I probably forgot someone. Of course, everything revolves around one line, but every hero has his own time. The only character I didn't 't like was not funny and came to not good (not good at all). And also, heroes look so real, with familiar human soft spots. Soft spot for a wife, for money, for a child, for power... I think every viewer will find a character with whom he can associate himself.I liked Ray and Coach the most. At first glance they both are clumsy, kind-hearted goofs. In fact, they are fast and intelligent warriors who are deeply committed to a sense of duty. Even though they understand the duty in a very special way.I also was in the aisles because of the sassy, Machiavellian, resilient hero of Hugh Grant, who can creep into any hole without a soap and wriggle out of most unfavorable situation.Now about the dynamics of the film. At first, the plot develops slowly. But then it begins to spins, and at the very end, I barely could follow changes. Two hours flew for me unnoticed, although usually, I feel exhausted wathich even an hour without a break. Apparently, I constantly had to think intensely to trace the plot. I was ready to watch it a second time right after the movie.The trailer, IMHO, does not reflect, how much this film is cool, at least for 10%. It is a secret for me, why. Perhaps creators were afraid to make a bad break, which will destroy viewers' tension. From the trailer, I could only understand I'll see a beautiful picture and much of action. Likely, Guy Ritchie, due to his reputation, can afford such a vague trailer - viewers will come anyway. Love at first sight is not a usual thing for me, but this movie definitely fell into this category.10 of 10.P.S. We were at cinema with Mom, she liked it a lot, too.",The Gentlemen

Amazing job done with the slow zoom transitions, they added good suspense and slow pacing at the right times. I did liked also the comedic side of it, carefully balanced to not make it goofy.

The only thing that let it down was the plastic overacting of Charlie Hunnam, this mans portrayal of a scary gangster reminded of a primary school play I watched once, truly awful, after watching most of his movies now and given many second chances, this was the final straw, he ruined the movie, in future I will be avoiding his movies like the plague.",The Gentlemen

1095,dnpian0,100% Style,7,12 March 2020,"There are a lot of things I liked about this movie, but I have to be honest, throughout a lot of scenes I was bored. I don't know what it was, but I think it comes down to the fact that the basic storyline is not really that interesting and/or original. It is, after all a regular ganster movie with regular conflicts. Lots of men in suits threatening each other, lots of talk about money, barely any females. I would even go so far as to say that this could be described as being style without substance, or (if I was being radical) as being the kind of movie that promotes a dangerous image of masculinity.BUT, that being said, I did enjoy it because it had everything I like about Guy Ritchie movies. I just love the fast cuts and the often absurd humor and the slickness of it all. As a female, I just have a thing for seeing neatly dressed guys with neatly cropped hair trying to outwit each other.So yeah, there were moments I found dry and the basic story is something I rather not think about too deeply, but I do think that it was quite well-made for what it was.",The Gentlemen

It was so hilarious and at the same time a classy gangster flick with tales of loyalty and betrayal! McConaughey at his usual best, Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrell were terrific! Guy Ritchie is back with a bang with his brilliant narrative! Michelle Dockery was a badass queen, Hugh Grant had is character paralleled to Krishna from the Indian Epic Mahabharata. The scene between Henry Golding and Michelle Dockery was filmed beautifully. The filmmaker is back to his Snatch and Lock Stock days!",The Gentlemen
1098,DrinkBathwater,Everybody talks in analogies...?,5,3 April 2020,"As a whole, The Gentlemen was very distracting and odd. The dialog was completely loaded with metaphors and zingers, the editing (and random use of b roll) was jarring and over-stylized, there was no character growth, the meta screenplay insert didn't add to the story at all, to name a few. The tone was intended to be fun, but there was hardly any room for that (aside from the on-foot chase scene, the gym guys' battle video, and Hugh Grant's quirkiness). The dramatic moments could of been a little more tense, but not a single one of the villains posed any sort of threat to the protagonists. The good guys kind of steam rolled through the turncoats and rival dealers. Everything worked out and it was super easy for them, which might be a first for a crime movie.The casting in the movie was excellent, but the character's motivations were so clean cut and obvious that the sense of mystery was essentially absent. The directing and acting shined. Yet, there was no momentum or character moments to really speak of; which, as a viewer, made the whole endeavor seem one-note.Other noteworthy aspects were the cinematography and soundtrack. Nothing bad to say here.I can see why lots of people would enjoy this movie, but I had a hard time getting into it.",The Gentlemen

It's a lightheaded action-comedy-drama gangster flick and this exact style is why we love Guy Ritchie.

The last being the least of the three. They all have their charm and capture the british identity really well.This film....felt like 1 long extended cheap advert. There is tremendous acting talent in this film with Matthew Mcconaughy, I found Hugh Grants part to be very amusing and entertaining. However, this film falls short in so many areas. Its forced diversity quota it had to meet ultimately ended up tainting it. The asian crime family felt particularly off and then came the ""buzy malone"" addition to the film....my word easily the worst and most out of place scenes in the entire movie. A random forced grime 'music' video into the film, the fighting scene was.....something you would see in a 1999 batman and robin film. It bugged me for the rest of the film I suppose you could say.By the end of movie it had me feeling that Guy Ritchie has lost touch with both the british crime genre and reality. But maybe the fact he based this so heavily around modern Britain explains why the british feeling so so absent.A movie for casual cinema goers and nothing more. I did not expect much from this film after seeing the trailer and sadly my worst fears were confirmed. It almost feels as if some sad imposter was trying to impersonate Guy Ritchies style.

Also, British Crime films are hella fun",8,24 April 2020,"""When the lion is hungry, he eats!""Guy Ritchie's latest is a definite must see for the Crime comedy genre fans. If you are not familiar with this director, his most mainstream film is Robert Downey's Sherlock and the recent Aladdin live action adaptation. In this movie, The Gentlemen, we follow a boss-man who wants out of the drug game..and as in the wild, all other contenders to the throne will see this as weakness and naturally hilarity and mayhem ensue... A simple enough premise, but executed elegantly by the man who brought us Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels; Snatch and RocknRolla.Excellent casting all around particularly with Matthew McConaughey as protagonist. Hugh Grant was probably the standout, haven't seen him in a while. He plays a shrewd blackmailer who serves as our unreliable narrator. I just feel like we're missing a certain Mark Strong in this movie...but we got a Jeremy Strong so I guess that'll do..heheheThe violence is sparse but effective. This isn't really a shoot em up. And as with any Guy Ritchie film, you have to pay attention to the multiple plot threads and nuances in dialogue or you'll get lost fast.I'm always fascinated with his British Crime films as this doesn't really translate well in the usual American setting that we as an audience is familiar with. Guns are banned in the UK so that dynamic greatly impacts how the criminal underground works in this story.8/10.",The Gentlemen

The plot full of satisfying twists, the acting astonishing I was really surprised by Charlie Hunnam and Michelle Dockery (not saying that the others weren't amazing but for example McConaughey is already a pretty established actor for me at least), the directing on point and the music also supreme.

In this movie, asian male characters got shot in balls, vomiting and got killed by the main character when he tried to rape a girl. Seriously, all embarrassing and humiliating storylines were given to asian characters. All other white characters are graceful and elegant. They can even run super fast after a car accident...I am not a sensitive asian person who talk about race stereotypes. But this is too much. I live in Melbourne and do you know how many people came here because the asian actor in the crazy rich asian is in it? A lot. His face appears in every poster coz they want to convince asian heritage people to watch this movie. Then, they use stereotypes to build those characters. It is extremely hard for asian male characters to be visible. If you don't want to be inclusive, you don't have to.

I love that he uses actors that are not really in the spotlight now and uses them in totally different characters to what were use to, hugh grant in this is great and very funny.
All the actors play great parts and the film was great.

1163,Soap-MacTavish,Drinking tea doesn't make you a UK Gangster!,5,30 March 2020,"A good script wasted is the first thought that comes to mind. The casting is just wrong in almost every way, McConaughey and Hunnan In this genre are about as interesting as watching paint dry and even Hugh Grant is not a good choice as the storyteller. The only redeeming main character is Colin Farrel as the coach, his quick tongue and London style swagger make him believable. If you've been living in a place like the UK for any length of time you take on some local mannerism, your accent changes, you integrate, McConaughey and Hunnan's characters did none of that.
Guy Ritchie has 2 movies in my top ten best movies of all time so I'm definitely a fan, but this just looks like a made for America UK Crime Comedy, and that doesn't make sense or work.",The Gentlemen

1168,anatolystrandberg,I'm sorry Mr. Ritchie,4,2 May 2020,"I have no idea, why so many people rated this movie so highly. Maybe it is ok in terms of cinematography and acting, but the story and writing is just bad. First of all there is no protagonist. There no interesting characters in this. Is Matthew McConaughey a protagonist? - No! He is doing almoust nothing through the whole film. He had a cool disposition abot his rise to power though, i would love to watch that movie instead. There is no depth to this character, except a couple of cool speaches. Is Charlie Hunnam, who's basicaly a McConaughey's butler a protagonist? - No! He's main characterestic his unexplained loyalty. Basicaly the two characters are some sort of snobish gangsters look a likes, spending time in some pretensious bar. Martial guys disposition was cool, could also be a good movie. And the biggest flaw is that the whole premise is not believable. Good thing about previous Guy Ritchie movies was the chaos. Characters are being drawn into a mayhem of events. Stupidity and chance make movies funny and give them that sense of reality, because reality is also unpredictable. Gentlemen is all about plans, and characters magicaly forseeing each other actions, so the film fieels like a scenario, it fails in creating an illusion of reality. So it is just a generic gangster movie.",The Gentlemen

It's not going to change your life, but it is wonderfully entertaining. Hugh Grant's dialog is incredibly well-written, and he delivers it brilliantly.

1194,brooklyntbo,A welcomed progression in the Ritchie-verse,9,25 January 2020,"I've been awaiting the next installment from Ritchie, well, since Rock'n'rolla. My opinion is fully slanted towards the favorable since watching Lock stock.To be quite honest, while this is is an original film, it's more of a slow burn rendition of previous London gangster Ritchie stories.The cast of characters each get their time to shine and steal the spotlight. There really isn't a ""main character"" and every protagonist an anti hero.Ritchie continues to show his theme of ""not that bad"" through MMS character dialogue about how his vice- weed- doesn't actually kill anyone, and tbh I have to appreciate it.The typical troupes I was yearning for were all there- excessive cockney slang, the anxiety of presumes violence (but only when necessary), and a 3rd act that has the serendipitous ending where everyone you rooted for makes it out, and the scumbag receives the sharp end of the karmic stick.I do wish there was more of Coach (Ferrell) and less Fletcher (Grant), but still loved it.My only wishlist item is that I'd woulda giggled if the narrator was Allen ford or vinny Jones, just to have a deep cut/call back to past films.",The Gentlemen

One can immediatley get sucked into the plot and look forward to it. The dialogues and conversation are mediocre. Much of the problem here comes from overuse of profanityThere is nothing wrong with using profanity, but the way it used in the film, it is rather unnecessary and forceful.The direction and background score are also average. The film takes a good story and cast but is too casual with the execution. They have also poorly utilized British humor. Many people think there are some dark jokes here, unfortunately it is just more unnecessary profanity and not really humerous.It is a watchable movie, but it absolutely does not merit anything above a 7 on a good day!",The Gentlemen

The movie looked at how the that made him feel but not how she felt. Then, after a few hours or days, she was ready to have sex with him, even though it was his terrible decisions that had put her in that position.
The main black character Ernie (played by Bugzy Malone, whose upbringing in real life is a story in itself) was called a ""Black C%$£"" and when he tried to stand up for himself he was talked out of it by a white guy who was supposed to be a mentor but actually bullied teenagers, armed them and got them involved in making bestiality videos.
I know it's a Guy Richie gangster movie called ""The Gentlemen"" so it's not like we should expect it to be socially responsible but it still seems more damaging than it needs to be. All of characters were massive stereotypes but the representations of most of the white men were that they were powerful and rich and that they could transcend class through violence.

Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed. The story is OK, rather slow at times and a few bits that make little sense when unpicked, but it was just about bearable. The dialogue is generally overblown and at times laughably bad. The whole thing is unrealistic in the extreme. The weakest part is Matthew, played by Jeremy Strong. I'm not sure if he's just an appalling actor, if his dialogue in this was particularly silly, or a combination of both, but it was distractingly, embarrassingly awful.I've happily enjoyed the highly stylised, slick, funny and brutal work of Guy Ritchie in the past, but this film is not the best.",The Gentlemen

A crime drama with an unreliable narrator and semi-nonlinear plot. Can't say I have seen all of his work but if you have watched Snatch and Lock and Stock you won't get nothing different than a more refined but samey rendition of his style.
The heavy and 4th wall breaking editing is quite on the nose and distracting, adding little to the plot. Luckily enough past the first quarter of the movie it tones done quite a bit, and by the first third the plot starts finally picking up, making the experience quite enjoyable.",The Gentlemen

It also fit the story and character, having Hugh Grant's char aspiring to be a filmmaker.Everything was utilized, setup well, and there were fire and great consequences to each action.

Talking about the actors,Matthew McConaughey is absolutely outstanding with his natural immersion in every person he plays, Matthew put in this character all his soul, adding a coldness that Mickey Pearson demands as a king pin.
Hugh Grant bring to us a lot of sarcasm, irony and a mercenary ideology that remember us the old days of Ritchie prima donna.
Charlie Hunnam, this is a special peace about the movie, here the actor claims his old soul that had a little glimpse of the great ""Sons of Anarchy"" Jack Teller, but here Charlie is a more mature person and actor.
Congratulations for the movie !",The Gentlemen
1237,pruthvimg,New age classy gangster movie,8,20 February 2021,"Guy Ritchie being a pioneer in delivering a crime/comedy has delivered it once again. even though the narration and story is pretty straight forward, it's fun to watch. Absolute subtle acting by whole cast especially supporting characters were amazing and Matthew mcconaughey have portrayed the classy gangster role in the finest way. Finally special applause to the music and background it did sync with the narration perfectly.

Charlie is great his accent sometimes swings between a brummy and his Sons teang but after this first 5 minutes you forget all about it and Matthew McConaughey, ever since he got away from the Rom/Coms has been getting better and better, probably this nicest drug kingpin since Mr Nice himself.

The twists are good, the jokes are great but what stands out are the performances. A 'star studded cast' seems to be the highlight of every movie nowadays but let me tell you, the majority of the performances in this film are oscar worthy and pure gold. I say majority of course because Jeremy Strong enlisted one of the worst acting performances I've seen this decade!It is by far a better tribute to cinema than that 'Once upon a time' nonsense and I urge you to see this film.The only drawback for me is the third act. Too many pipes are introduced late in the film which contributes to a somewhat lacklustre and crammed finale. But apart from that a solid film.",The Gentlemen

Moreover, all characters are formed very much. It is also no typical mafia film like one knows it, because it is primarily about the story as around power or drugs what, however, still a role in him film plays. A star deduction gives it still there the stories at the end a little bit compulsive tries to surprise the spectator by sudden idioms and without to spoilers I find the last action of the boxers a little bit questionably after them knew what mighty and dangerous type of the principal characters is.

Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is looking to get out of his drug empire, so he's looking to sell it off. What we get, though, is a whole lot of chaos and laughs along the way.Today is January 23rd, so when I went to see this movie I wasn't expecting a good movie. January movies are full of garbage a lot of the time, so I thought this could be next line of filth that Hollywood wanted to give us at this time of year, but this is not what happened.""The movie was actually GREAT""Guy Ritchie, the writer and director of the film, is most known for ""Snatch"", which is also a movie that involves a ton of chaos and laughs, and ""The Gentlemen"" is much of the same. If I had to describe this movie in one sentence it would be as follows:""It's what 'Knives Out' wanted to be.""""Knives Out"" came out last year and many people enjoyed it. It was a ""who done it"" film with a ton of self aware comedy and plenty of action but, to me, the comedy didn't quite stick the way Rian Johnson wanted it to, but ""The Gentlemen's"" humor does stick with us in this film. And yes, there is plenty of mystery to go around in the film, which makes the action sequences and the dry British humor that much better.When we think Guy Ritchie, we think of humor but something that might be overlooked is the style of his movies. They are stylistic. It might come as a surprise that dry British humor can also have a sort of artistic style to go with it but it can. From the closeups to the quick cut action shots, Guy Ritchie delivers and he delivers this same style to ""The Gentlemen.""Is there an acting performance that stands out from this movie? No, I don't think one actor steals the show or carries it. The whole cast does a good job at teaming up to make this a fun, comedic, action filled movie. Though, I will say, Hugh Grant is quite good in his scenes and so is Colin Farrell. Much of the same could be said about Charlie Hunnam, who I'm not the most familiar with.This wasn't your average January movie, and could have definitely been a Summer movie if the studios so wished to do so. If you liked ""Snatch"" you will love this movie a ton, but even if you didn't I would still go for Matthew McConaughey and his easy coolness.""Alright, alright, alright.""",The Gentlemen

It was more like a series of tenuously linked scenes than an actual story. Ropey old fashioned racism that would make any right thinking person cringe and feel deeply uncomfortable. School boy repetitive offensive language for no real reason but an attempt to shock or be funny (FYI it did neither). Plus weird 1 dimensional characters with seemingly meaningless traits ie why does Charlie H's character have OCD one minute and no symptoms of it the next? Why exactly was the young girl with a heroine addiction an addict and why did she die? Even HG's involvement couldn't save it. Good accent and bit of humour but my God can the man take a breath and stop talking for 5 seconds?

1303,margohendrix,Familiar territory for Guy Ritchie,7,3 January 2020,"To certain degree The Gentlemen is your stereotypical Ritchie crime caper full of entertaining and colourful characters synonymous with his films. While the script lacks the depth, twists and sub plots of his previous successful forays into the crime genre namely Lock Stock and Snatch. Richie, does have a way of getting performances of note from his cast member's. The aforementioned title certainly delivers again for the director in this respect. While Mcconnaughy delivers with the unmistakable charisma we have come to expect from him, it was the particularly interesting and unfamiliar role of Hugh Grant that caught the eye and highlighted a type of variety not often seen in the work of Grant. Another notable mention must go to Colin Farrell who presents as a sharp and quick witted character prone to a criminal venture. For all the criticism of Farrell and his perceived lack of range, this character and script play to his strengths and showcase his underrated skills as a comic actor. To summarise, this film is by no means a Richie masterpiece and does have a sense of predictability. What it lacks in substance and grit, it makes up for in a wit and it's free flowing pace. Best enjoyed with limited expectations and a less than serious approach!",The Gentlemen

Collin Fararrell just about saved this film with the stereotypical funny Irishman. Suprised they let bugsy malone (rapper) feature so much in this film too having his cringy song mid film and end credits. I am a fan of Charlie Hannam but he can not do a british accent to save his life. The role he played should have been an American character as the entire film he sounded mumbled and mixed American, Irish, manc, scouse and every other type of strange tongue making his character awkward to watch.

1319,pakiman_imzy,Could of been so much more.,6,14 February 2020,"Firstly I must say the there are good things about this movie just a few bad things that let the filn as a whole down. The story was good, witty, with a shy bit of British dry humour. Those of you that know of the comedian Jack Dee will know what I mean. Now to the bad, having an 18 rating could of made this movie a 10/10 if it was used correctly. If you are going to make an 18 rated british ganster movie, you need to add the correct level of violence. There was hardly any. It's as if the continuous use of the c word was in hope to make up for what was clearly a budgeting issue. This movie clearly used up too much of it's budget on the actors leaving not enough needed to make full use of having an 18 rating.I would not recommend watching this in a cinema and wasting the money on what you are made to believe is an action packed British gangster/comedy. The lack of needed violence lets the film as a whole down.",The Gentlemen

1322,syfriedrich,Absolutely magnificent !!!,9,21 May 2021,"Funny, dark humored, yet classy and thrilling masterpiece.A movie, that features some of the greatest actors of our time, combined with the unique directing style, which Guy Ritchie is known for, offers an exciting and phenomenal cinematic experience.The way he develops the storyline through the use of plot twists and use of different narratives captivates the viewers and makes it impossible to loose excitement throughout the film. In addition to that, the unlinear use of time catches the audiences attention and offers different insights into the lifes of the characters and their development throughout the story.The excellent combination of drama, thriller and comedy makes you experience the entire spectrum of emotions in a manner that pulls you into another world.Its serious topics, as for example drug use, addiction, and corruption, are presented to the viewer from different points of view. Once you add just a tiny bit of drama and a tasteful amount of dark humor you end up with a masterpiece that is barely comparable to any other movie.This is exactly what cinema is supposed to be and most definitely one of my all-time favorites. We highly recommend this film to anyone with even the slightest amount of taste!!!",The Gentlemen

I was working my way through Scorsese and Tarantino movies when I came accross ""Lock, Stock, and two Smoking Barrels"" went from this to ""Snatch"" to ""RocknRolla"" and never looked back.Movies about crime and boxing that take themselves seriously enough to be worth the watch, but lightly enough you don't end up depressed at the end.""The Gentlemen"" is a return to form.

1326,ayushpoolovadoo,A Damn Good Film!,9,4 March 2020,"After having seen the two Sherlock Holmes films, Lock Stock, Snatch and the Man in Uncle, I just couldn't wait to see what Guy Ritchie was coming up with next. After seeing the trailer, I was more than convinced that this film was him returning to his genre with grace and that I had to see this in theatres. Was able to catch it on the last day it was showing in my country.First off, the script is pure Ritchie. And by that, I mean that the characters do not hesitate to use their expletives but Mr Ritchie uses them perfectly and comically. The entire cast does justice to their characters and it's hard to take your eyes off any of them, especially Colin Farrell as Coach and Hugh Grant as Fletcher, my God these guys can act! The people who think that this movie is homophobic, racist and sexist either think that criminals are all polite and tolerant people or that people in real-life don't actually talk like this. If so, they need to stay away from these kinds of movies because it's not for them. All in all, great movie, would watch it again in theatres if I could!Just two major drawbacks I have to the film: 1) the sub-plot with Pearson being asked to find Laura felt like it was straight out of Matthew Vaughn's Layer Cake, another movie I love, and 2) The almost-rape scene with Dry Eye and Rosalind Pearson at the film's climax. While I don't normally shy away from such scenes, it just felt a bit gratuitous, especially since Ritchie's brand of violence and gore is meant to be much more comedic. My friends and I were laughing at almost every other instance of violence in the film. It may just be me since I wasn't expecting it, but I felt it was a tad too much.Overall, loved it! Would highly recommend it!!!",The Gentlemen

Every dramatic and comedic moment is enhanced by the music.....I find myself watching certain parts over and over again....like the race to get the cell phones...that scene with the accompanying music is fantastic.... Cinematography is great too. Guy Ritchie makes this a quintessential English movie...I think!....Not being an Anglophile or someone hasn't even spent time there....except for a 2 day stint on my way to Paris....who knew that such a bad word in the USA (cu***) could be used so often as a comedic and dramatic situations in a movie! Great movie.....It feels Quentin Tarantinoisc , but in a totally unique way that may become a Gut Ritchie signature in the future if he pursues it further...and I hope he does!!! I think Guy Ritchie has proven himself as a top tier director with this movie.

Excellent story,great cast....and that's where it all ends.
I'm sure if you were a 90's kid,you would have fantasized about being a character in one of guy ritchie's movies,its that good!!
The way he shows us the back alley life style of London with all cut throats,drugs,hit men,bosses etc,gave a new perspective.
They were all classics.well except for swept away of course.
This movie has to be the weakest in the link.even though it had all the potential for being one of his best works.
weak plots,wanna be of the older movies,less intense,softened characters these all could have been avoided if the movie was taken with the same energy level as the earlier ones.
Thank go for the last 30 mins or else it would have been total disaster.That too said it is not that intense.if you watch the last 30 mins first,we would think as the movie has a good start and it can go very well from now on as in par with his older movies and with the potential it has.
well all this changes when cash truck comes out i hope and all the best for future endeavors.

1336,collincarpenter-89905,"Fun style, decent substance",8,12 April 2020,"Something I want to get out of the way is that I'm not a huge Guy Ritchie fan. In fact this was the first movie of his I ever watched. But I gotta say I was pretty surprised. I walked into the theatre expecting nothing more than a decent crime movie and instead I left having seen a great one.As far as the technical side of things goes it's pretty great. The movie is shot with personality and it feels like you see a different technique or shot every few minutes. The editing had its own flare as it felt quick but still professional. Besides those things everything else was fine on the technical side of things.When it comes to the screenplay, dialogue, characters, acting, etc; there is a bit more to talk about. As far as characters and the acting goes it was great. The characters were all memorable and fun to watch and were complimented by good performances from all the actors alike.When it comes to the story it could be a bit more fine tuned. There are one or two points where things feel a bit jumbled and the movie starts to shove a bit too much exposition down your throat, and while not enough to ruin the movie it was enough to weigh it down a bit. Fortunately when these exposition dumps happened the style and manner in which the dialogue is delivered still sells it pretty well.And speaking of delivery of dialogue the witting of aforementioned dialogue is good. The lines are witting and funny most of the time and this movie managed to get a few chuckles out of me. Even when there is a weak line the actors deliveries are able to sell it.Overall this movie is a fun crowd pleaser that has a engaging style that has convinced me to check out some of Guy Ritchies other movies, so check it out.",The Gentlemen

The scene with confronting Dry Eye (with a handgun) for example, that's a pure cringe. Did Guy made Americans annoying on purpose? Jeremy Strong has the similar issue, being not living his character. Sometimes you feel like their dialogues are used only to extend the running time.Plot twists like farm raid leading back to Michael, or the Aslan being the son of Russian oligarch were somehow dull.That throw up scene caught me off guard. It doesn't fit the film and should have been left in Director's Cut.Good things: the setting is great, English underworld image is what always impressed me in Ritchie's movies. And the secondary characters such as Ray, Fletcher, Dry Eye and Coach, which kept me watching. They deserve their credit.",The Gentlemen

Then, when you come back to the reality (with a slight adrenaline kick of pleasure), you realize it was exactly right. I watched this movie already a couple times, and because of multiple scenes and complex story, you get something new out of it every time.Some don't like the movie because it is a typical Guy Richie movie all over again, I like it because of that.

1371,HatstandPetersen,Worse than poor,1,1 February 2021,"Within about five seconds of the opening moments of the camera panning across the inside of what is an ostentatiously 'proper boozer' I knew I was in trouble. Something smelt off. Then a flicker went off in my memory. Something connected. A vague memory that this might just be a Guy Ritchie movie. A few more minutes of wall to wall cliche made me certain. I decided to persevere, as Ritchie's films vary between the daftly watchable but instantly forgettable and the pompous and dull. I had hoped for the former, I got the latter. This film is dreadful. All the worst Ritchie trademarks are there. The infantile flashy 'look at me', gimmicky camera techniques, the tedious sub-Tarantino dialogue, the woeful acting performances squeezed like processed liver sausage out of a good cast, the macho cartoonish mockney roguery, all interspersed with the fortune cookie/spliffhead philosophy that really makes one ask questions, such as 'why the hell am I still watching this'. The entire cast are so constantly delighted by their own performances that you expect that they will turn to the camera at any moment and say - ""you didn't know I was this good did you"" before pausing to admire themselves in the mirror before returning dutifully to the script. But worst of all this film is just painfully dull. It takes a special talent to make something so incredibly ludicrous and hyperreal but at the same time so extraordinarily dull. For this reason I didn't even make it to the half-hour mark and, even though I didn't, I can still provide the following big spoiler - this film is very, very, very bad.",The Gentlemen

So i sit down to watch The Gentlemen. All i can say it will be yet another masterpiece that i will be watching and laughing too for the rest of my days.

And not even that spectacular cast can sustain a mediocre history in a boundless new attempt to be cool and, as an early and very enjoyable movies of Ritchie as his remarkable debut with ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", ""Snatch"", or ""RocknRolla"": transgressor.

It's peppered with more swearing than any other Ritchie film to date and breaks every rule in the PC handbook. It should see reviewers from liberal media like Salon have an aneurysm. The acting is just superb throughout, with a special shout out should go to a very cockney Hugh Grant who plays a character that is very far removed from his Notting Hill days.

The script is AWFUL - Ritchie badly wants to make another Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and The Gentlemen is not it. The comedy felt tacked on, just rehashed internet memes (characters talking about ""nightmare fuel"" and things they ""can't unsee"" felt like I was reading a Reddit thread. Beyond that I couldn't get past how poorly characterized all the characters were. Nobody stood out as having a unique personality. No chemistry between McCounaghey and Dockery. Jeremy Strong was abysmal in his role, every line delivered with a weird, Lovitzian attempt at humor. It felt like he was reading the script as a mockery.

1432,benyantis,"A brilliant, humerous film. Guy Ritchie returns to his roots.",8,29 January 2020,"January tends to be the Hollywood dump month for movies. All the big players are released in November and December, so when a movie like this comes along, I have to be a little bit skeptical about it. Fortunately, The Gentlemen packs a hard punch, and is a very entertaining movie.For fans of other Guy Ritchie films, like ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch,"" then you should enjoy this one. The pacing is lightning fast, and there is a lot of information thrown at you during the 113 minute run time, but the movie flows so well, that it worked for me. Guy Ritchie wrote all the characters really well, and the witty dialogue reminded me of one of my favorites from last year, ""Knives Out."" The way the story is told is quite unique, and the twists and fake outs used were quite entertaining, not everything may be exactly what we see. The story is written well, and every detail works together and well layered with many different moving parts that kept me on the edge of seat the entire time.The movie wastes no time getting started. It opens up on what looks like the inevitable, but then takes us back and shows everything leading up to that point. A lot of substance in the first act may lead to some confusion and maybe a little bit of a headache with all the information thrown at the audience. The second act slows down a little as the characters have already been solidified and I was able to catch my breath a little bit before the final act, which is incredible. Everything had a purpose and led up to a great finish.Perhaps the best part of this movie would have to be the acting. McConaughey puts forth one of his best performances in a while, and even with how great he was, he wasn't even the best part. Charlie Hunnam plays the right-hand man, and is one of the coolest characters I've seen in a movie for a while, his presence is powerful when on screen. The biggest highlight however would have to be Hugh Grant, the accent is great, and he delivers a hilarious and clever performance, very different than I've known him for.I would highly recommend checking out ""The Gentlemen"" for an extremely fun movie, and it might be hard to find new movie to top this one for a while. It may not be quite as violent as I was expecting, but what is there is insane and hilarious at times. A great film if you like complex storylines with witty and humerous dialogue. The Gentleman is the first great film of 2020 and I encourage you to check it out!",The Gentlemen

Yes, the film has the Same fast paced stylised editing that we're used to, but due to fantastic performances, especially from Mathew McConaughey and Hugh Grant, the characters feel more rounded. One line witty 'Landan' Sarcasm is all still there, just with added finesse, you will really love spending time with these guys.
However, Henry Golding doesn't really have much to do but is charming all the same (not doing his Bond chances any harm). Unfortunately it's the Women that suffer, only one good female performance from Michelle Dockery, who always manages to hold her own. Maybe Guy is just a guys' guy and therefore writes better for.. you know ... guys.
Where this film really comes to life is when the familiar old school' gentlemen' gangsters cross paths with the younger generation. Bringing the film right in line with the you tube genaration, an amazing""fight "" scene picks the pace up ten fold.
The bewilderment of the old firm when trying to deal with the new is where it's at its most fun
(especially when it takes a sub machine gun to get a point across). With the only bridge being offered by a never better Colin Farell.
We have a film that is set in the ""here and now"" and not in 2002, although unmistakingly a ""Guy Ritchie"" film, it's very different from his original two and definitely worth a trip to the cinema.",The Gentlemen

The sheer amount of unoriginal washing machine cycled gumpf that has made its way to our screens lately, has been forgotten in 140 minutes of sheer brilliance. When I say brilliance, I'm not talking Seven Samurai or One flew over the cuckoo's nest. I'm talking about watching it again within a month of seeing it. Missing the characters. Repeating the lines to your friends. That kind of brilliance.If you loved Lock Stock or Snatch, go see it. If you can't afford to see it, watch it at a friend's. If you don't have any friends, use your imagination!This movie was good enough to stop me reminding myself not to move so much during a showing. I wanted to stay for more ""what it finished, oh no!""

I was doing something else at home and needed something on in the background so saw this on Amazon Prime and stuck it on. Wow. Needless to say I didn't get anything else done as I got sucked into the movie. Hugh Grant is amazing. Who knew he had more to him than playing posh toffs? Really great performance. I'm not a fan of Colin Farrell but he was spot on in this role. Matthew McConaughey oozes confidence and smoulders alongside his strong ballsy wife Michelle Dockery.The plot was fab. The story telling aspect kept me interested. The main characters and smaller characters were all great. The Toddlers were great energy. I loved it all. Highly recommend it,The Gentlemen

Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam lead an excellent acting performance supported by McConaughey and Jeremy Strong.Third act had some introductory elements that felt shoehorned and the meta element of this being a screenplay wasn't necessary.

We loved every minute of it and made plans for a second viewing before we even left the theater.Charlie Hunnam was an understated delight.

I should have gone with my instinct to leave after the first five minutes but I endured the first 45 minutes waiting for some kind of storyline to develop and ended up walking out to watch the tail end of another movie.It seems like the writers left nothing in the script for this cast of normally great actors to get their teeth into so they spent most of their time filling the void with expletives, drug use and trying trying to offend and shock rather than act.I could have seen this in the carpark or any houso estate for free.

This might be appealing to some teenagers hence the high rating it has but it's bad taste movie overall. The whole movie is bunch of characters acting cocky and brand placement and violence. The violence is not the problem we all like Tarantino movies, nice character development, interesting plot...but this it's garbage. This movie is like a bad taste individual that signals wealth by wearing clothes in LV print and a huge Gucci logo. It's like a heavy gold wearing gipsy.

1523,simon-14244,Ritchie has lost it completely,3,4 January 2020,"I'm not one to come here to write reviews but after seeing all the reviews here I feel I need to add my opinion. The film starts out with High Grant sounding like a David Williams, little Britton hard man talking to Charlie Hunnam doing his best Tom hardy impression. This goes on for most of the film with some incredibly weak dialogue which really struggle to keep you interested. McConaugheys character is very similar to his character out of true detective which is fairly enjoyable but nothing new. Now the rest of the story has a few entertaining moments and Colin Farrell is great but there really isn't anything else to enjoy. The story is trying to be upto date but just shows how out of touch Ritchie really is and you can pretty much predict the whole story as it folds out. Also the less said about the movie script ending the better. I really recommend you skip this film and save you're money. I used a gift card and still felt like I got a bad deal.",The Gentlemen

1527,lolamarriott,Strange Anglican fantasy,5,28 January 2020,"Ritchie's impulse to stage the superiority of the white, British-accented, well-dressed, ""moral"" male often completely undermined any attempt at successful storytelling. Depicting gangs has never been about an attempt to ""moralise"", but instead a way of complicating and presenting racial / class dynamics in an ambiguous way. These are not supposed to be heroes and villains, and it's frankly odd and misplaced of Ritchie to suggest that ""loving your wife"" and ""hating junkies"" are enough to redeem gang violence and countless other abhorrent acts.
The Gentleman's insistent fetish for a ""nostalgic past"" led to an unpalatable amount of racial slurs and derogatory terms that were just cringeworthy. We get it, free speech man.
Nonetheless, I enjoyed Hugh Grant's frame narrative a lot which prodded necessary fun at these structures. Also really enjoyed Colin Farrell, which again complicated the rigidity of these outdated structures.

So, hopeful, I continued watching. Boy was I right in the end! Ritchie doesn't disappoint when it comes to this particular style of filming. As the film progressed, the level of intrigue and entertainment just keeps rising and rising.
