0,SnoopyStyle,lacks tension,6,10 June 2021,"It's 1981. The Warrens (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) are participating in the exorcism of a boy named David Glatzel. It leads to the case of Arne Johnson who claims that The Devil Made Me Do It.I noticed early on that there is limited tension in this movie. I figured out that I don't care about Arne and nothing will happen to the Warrens since this is a prequel. I don't know any of these new people. Once Arne is in prison, I also realized that the legal system would never let him go. The Warrens can't prove this stuff in a court of law. It all culminates with the realization that this story is more a courtroom drama than a horror. This is not scary. As a horror, it is a stale by-the-coloring-book movie. It has nothing inventive or compelling. The supernatural becomes a series of random superpowers. I still love the Warrens but this is a bland superhero movie.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
1,nogodnomasters,Why is Irrelevant,7,15 June 2021,"This is yet another story from the Warren case files. There is no introduction of the Warrens as the film expects you to know who they are their previous films. The film starts out with an exorcism and Arne Johnson (Ruairi O'Connor ) does they ""take me"" to the demon/devil to save the boy. The thing is, he doesn't jump out of a window afterwards. Instead, he kills a man. The Warrens are working on the Flip Wilson ""The Devil made me do it"" defense which takes them across New England.If you seen these before, you know they all end the same way, with Ed adding an artifact which he stole to his private collection of demonically possessed pieces and ugly dolls.Based on a true event and juiced up to be entertaining.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
2,kosmasp,True story (well sounds better if you say it is),8,25 June 2021,"So I did not research the couple that is depicted here, but it always sounds better if you say that something is based on something real and true. This is pure horror but it still was a nice double bill with A Quiet Place 2 at the Festival I saw them the other day - so good to be back in cinemas. Now you may think that that may have swayed me to give this a bit of a higher/better rating that you would have given it ... maybe, but then again I am known for being nice to movies most of the time, than the other way around.Now I would say that you do not need to know the other movies to enjoy this. But of course if you do know your Conjuring-verse you will recognize certain things and have some fun with it. Just when Annabelle is mentioned for example ... but apart from those ""funny"" moments, you also have some genuine comedy in it. Let that not fool you ... because it also has a lot of scary moments ... and while you will probably be able to know where this is going, it still is very well told ... with a very tender and romantic moment towards the end, that made the audience go ""awww"" ... yes even horror can do that.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
3,classicsoncall,"""All right. Show me what you got.""",7,12 June 2021,"In terms of scares, this one is a bit more restrained than 2013's ""The Conjuring"". I haven't seen the second one in the series yet so can't comment there. Once again, paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) get involved with a case of demonic possession, this time following an evil presence from a young boy into an adult male who 'invited' the malignant entity into his body to save the suffering of his fiancee's brother. Though based on a true story, you can probably bet that some of the movie is fictionalized in the interest of making it more cinematically worthy. Lorraine Warren becomes a principal character here by virtue of her reliving the murder of a teenage girl by a close friend who harbored the same demon years earlier. The case was one of the more noteworthy ones of the Warren's distinguished career, and led to the first criminal court proceeding in which demonic possession was called upon by defense counsel. It might have been interesting if the movie dealt with some of the actual court proceeding to understand how opposing lawyers approached the case, knowing that an innocent verdict for Arne Johnson (Ruairi O'Connor) was pretty much out of the question.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
4,jboothmillard,The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It,5,31 May 2021,"The Conjuring Universe has had reasonable results since 2013, with only one or two disappointing movies in the franchise, this was the eighth instalment and I was glad to be able to go to the reopened cinemas to see it, directed by Michael Chaves (The Curse of La Llorona). Basically, set in 1981, young David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard) is possessed by a demonic spirit that wants the boy's soul. A priest attempts to perform an exorcism, but it looks hopeless. Hoping to get the spirit out of the boy's body, family friend Arne Cheyenne Johnson (Ruairi O'Connor) commands the spirit to leave the child's body and take him instead. The spirit leaves David's body and enters Arne, before seemingly disappearing. Meanwhile, paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) continue to do what they are now famous for, while also trying to maintain a home life with daughter Judy (Sterling Jerins). Elsewhere, Arne suddenly finds the evil spirit has returned and takes over his body, and the next thing he knows he finds himself walking along a road, stopped by a police officer as he is covered in blood. Arne is arrested for the suspected murder of his landlord, but in court, for the first time in U. S. history, he claims demonic possession as a defence. The Warrens are called to take on his case and investigate to prove his innocence. They return to the places the spirit was known to possess and attack people. Along the way the Warrens also talk to people they meet about how they meet and married in their teens. There is a point when they meet with Kastner (The Lord of the Rings' John Noble) who may have had his own experiences with the demonic spirit himself. The Warrens do indeed have their own violent encounters with the demon. In the end, despite the Warrens backing up his defence in court, Arne is sent to prison, charged with manslaughter, though he only served five years of a 10-to-20-year sentence. Also starring Sarah Catherine Hook as Debbie Glatzel, Eugenie Bondurant as The Occultist, Shannon Kook as Drew Thomas, Ronnie Gene Blevins as Bruno Sauls, Keith Arthur Bolden as Sergeant Clay, Steve Coulter as Father Gordon, Vince Pisani as Father Newman, Mitchell Hoog as young Ed Warren, and Megan Ashley Brown as young Lorraine Warren. Farmiga and Wilson reprise their roles and most engaging as the (real-life) duo, the story was reasonable, some jump scares I expected, one or two I didn't, and there were good special effects for the evil things going bump in the night, it was an alright supernatural horror. Worth watching!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
5,paul_haakonsen,"Just another generic entry into ""The Conjuring"" franchise...",4,6 June 2021,"I must admit that when I sat down to watch the 2021 addition to ""The Conjuring"" franchise, I was not harboring much of any overly great expectations or hopes, because since the first movie it has been a steady downward slope.Still, as I had the chance to sit down and watch ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" from writers David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and James Wan. So of course I did it.And I have to say that director Michael Chaves managed to deliver a movie that was only slightly entertaining. ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" was a whole lot of nothing going on, and you can essentially just watch the beginning and the last 25 minutes of the movie and skip on everything in between.The storyline written for ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" was bland and slow paced, with very little of much excitement or interest happening in between the start and the end of the movie. And that ultimately led to a less than mediocre movie experience for me.And yeah, I am a horror veteran, so ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" was a walk in park. There were a few jump scare moments to be had here, but they could be seen coming a mile away. And the storyline wasn't particularly dark, brooding or scary. So this was not an impressive foray into the horror genre.I will say that the special effects in ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" were good, and they definitely added something worthwhile to the movie. And ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" is not a movie that is a make or break experience with its special effects, but they do add a good element to the overall experience of the movie.The acting in the movie was good, but of course we are talking about actor Patrick Wilson and actress Vera Farmiga here, whom singlehandedly have been carrying the franchise with their performances. And true to the formula, they are the ones making it watchable again with the 2021 ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"". It should also be noted that the casting of Eugenie Bondurant as the occultist was a spot on choice, because she was genuinely creepy with her performance.As I entered this movie with no expectations I can't say that I was disappointed with the end result. But take heed, this is by no means a milestone in the horror cinema.""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" came and went without leaving a lasting impression for me, just as the numerous other movies in the franchise - as their spin-off movies - have done. I can't tell them apart if you were to ask me what the second movie was about, for instance.My rating of the 2021 ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" lands on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars. Sure, it was a watchable movie, and if you are new to the horror genre, then you will be in for something good I suppose. But if you expect a bit more from the movies you sit down to watch then ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" just doesn't cut it.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
6,BandSAboutMovies,The Devil wants his name off this.,2,6 June 2021,"You know, the Warrens were not Catholic superheroes. Despite warning us that the world was in a constant battle with demons, the Hollywood Reporter divulged that ""in the early 1960s, Ed Warren initiated a relationship with an underage girl with Lorraine's knowledge. Now in her 70s, Judith Penney has said in a sworn declaration that she lived in the Warrens' house as Ed's lover for four decades.""They were pretty much hucksters who knew how to keep themselves in the eye of the media and could always fall back on religion to literally say they were doing God's work. I guess that I don't mind the carny world all that much until it starts impacting people's lives more than the money they willingly give away.This movie is a case in point of my issues with them.It's based on the trial Arne Cheyenne Johnson, also known as the ""Devil Made Me Do It"" case. This case was the first known court case in the U. S. in which the defendant claimed that Satan took over their body and actually committed the crime.It all started when 11-year-old David Glatzel got possessed. The family brought in the Warrens to work with the Catholic Church to exorcise their son, at which point the demon left the child and went into Arne. Months later, Arne would kill his landlord and his defense lawyer that he was possessed.As soon as a day after the murder, Lorraine Warren told local police that Johnson was possessed when the crime was committed. A media blitzkrieg followed, because the warrens were planning lectures, a book and even a movie -- which was canceled -- would soon be forthcoming. There was a TV movie, The Demon Murder Case, but the whole furor died down when Judge Robert Callahan rejected the defense, saying that possession could never be proved and that it would be ""irrelative and unscientific"" to allow related testimony.On November 24, 1981, Arne was convicted of first-degree manslaughter, serving five years of a ten to twenty-year sentence. The book that followed, Gerald Brittle's The Devil in Connecticut, was published in 1983. When the book was republished in 2006, David Glatzel -- the kid who got possessed in the first place -- and his brother Carl sued for violating their right to privacy, libel and ""intentional affliction of emotional distress.""Carl claimed that the criminal and abusive acts against his family and others, as recounted by the book, were lies created by the Warrens to exploit his brother's mental illness. As he didn't believe anything the Warrens told him, he was painted as the bad guy. Even worse, he also stated that the Warrens explained to him that the story would make the family millionaires and get Johnson out of jail.Lorraine defended the story, bringing up the fact that six priests were involved in the incident. And as for Johnson, he continues to support the Johnsons and has stated that the lawsuit is so that the Glatzels can get rich.All of the real-life things you just read are way more interesting than this movie.There's a new bad guy -- The Occultist -- and a priest named Kastner who had a child and left the church, but not before battling the Disciples of the Ram cult. Also, Earl has a new kryptonite to deal with as exorcizing young David leads to him having a heart attack.The opening exorcism is pretty well-done and I was hoping for a return to form, as the original film in the series has some great art direction. Yet here we're dragging back into the universe of this film, with fanservice toward showing Annabelle and Valak, reminding us that perhaps this series best days are long behind it and if this were the 90s, this movie would have gone direct to video.That said, I love the team of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as the Warrens. However, I really disliked the directing style of Michael Chaves, whose The Curse of La Llorona was only halfway decent. There are plenty of opportunities for jump scares -- the scene with a haunted waterbed has such promise that fizzles out, showing that no one studies Val Lewton any longer -- and the rest of the movie is a strobing and confusing mess. They also must have not remembered the movie that this pays homage to -- A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master -- because that sequence is remembered to this day. This one will be gone in a week.This movie also seems obsessed with The Exorcist. In the opening, Father Gordon's arrival echoes the poster of that film and later, when Earl is in the hospital, we hear the name Dr. Merrin get called. These little asides to that classic did not make me think this was in the same pantheon of that film. It made me want to shut it off and watch that movie instead.I'm kind of sad that this movie was so bad. The past two films in the series have had great scares and I've kind of written the side stories off, thinking that at least the mainline films have been pretty good. Sadly, that downward slide of creativity has now extended toward this film, which was an utter waste of time and energy. At least people are vaccinated now and can't put their lives on the line to go and see it.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
7,CinemaSerf,Lacklustre horror effort...,6,9 June 2021,"This starts off really quite strongly. The Warren's - Ed (Patrick Wilson) and wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) are brought in to conduct an exorcism upon a young boy but somewhere during the process, the spirit manages to swap bodies and the life of the boy's older friend Arne (Ruairi O'Connor) starts to take on an unpredictable nature that culminates in him being charged for the murder of his friend - which we know he did. Was he possessed at the time of the crime? Well the Warren's decide that they are going to try and offer this as a form of defence and so they set about tracking down his demon and proving their point. It's from here on in that the thing falls away quite badly. John Noble hams up terribly, Farmiga and Wilson don't really work together convincingly and the ending - though quite tensely directed - just isn't scary in the slightest. Perhaps we are all becoming just too numb to the impact of visual effects to create menace? It is certainly becoming more difficult for a director to get those ""jump"" moments, especially with format horror like this. Sadly, truth isn't stranger than fiction any more and if the ""Conjuring"" is to continue, it will need quite a creative overhaul. This is worth a watch, but is pretty unremarkable.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
8,oscaralbert,You do not need to be Cotton Mather to realize . . .,7,9 June 2021,". . . that this blatant allegory involves far more than a few alleged demons and witches residing in Eastern Massachusetts during the 1900's. This newest CONJURING flick emanates from the always eponymous Warner Bros., and warns Americans of the half dozen High Court Roman sects cultists currently curbing the USA's Liberty, Freedom and very Survival. In fact, the prophetic prognosticators of Warner cast the main trio of satanic fiends as dead ringers for the three S. C. O. T. U. S. appointees made by Lucifer's top lieutenant ""Mad Dog"" Putin and his Oval Office puppet between 2017 and 2020. Furthermore, each time characters such as David, Arne and Ida begin to distort themselves to demonstrate demonic possession, they duplicate the positions of the human-shaped cockroaches we all watched (with cinematic horror!) climbing the walls of the U. S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. So ignore the incipient sects police at your own peril, Warner warns, for when the bell tolls, it may be tolling for you!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
9,neil-476,Detective horror,7,3 June 2021,"At the exorcism of a small boy, a young man invites the demon to posess him instead, which the demon duly does. The young man then murders someone and following the demon's departure, finds himself offering demonic possession as a defence (the court accepts God when administering oaths, so why not the Devil as a defence?). Occultist busybodies Ed and Lorraine Warren step up to research the history of the possession.PatricknWilson and Vera Farmiga once again play the couple with a basement full of creepy supernatual artefacts and a penchant for dancing around with the spirit world in this tale which is based - fairly loosely, I suspect - on one of their case files.To be fair, this one is far more detective-y than horror-y which means there is more story and less horror cliche. There is still some creepiness and a couple of made-you-jump moments, but there is more suspense over Ed's dicky heart and no Oh no, here comes the demon!This a tolerable time passer.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
10,view_and_review,"""The Conjuring"" is Still Strong",7,6 June 2021,"My third theater experience post-COVID and again it's from the horror genre. ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" continues to follow the Warrens (Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga)) and their demon fighting. This movie takes place in Brookfield, Connecticut circa 1981. It begins with them assisting in the exorcism of a little boy named David (Julian Hilliard). The exorcism fails, but the demon left the little boy and entered a young man named Arne (Ruairi O'Connor). Arne went on to commit a bloody murder and the Warrens were trying their best to prove that Arne was innocent for reasons of demon possession.For the sake of the movie I wanted them to prove their point. For the sake of reality I was hoping they'd fail-- or succeed yet fail with the jury. I can't imagine a bigger monkey wrench in a flawed justice system than an acquittal based upon demon possession.""The Conjuring"" offered some decent jump scares, but more importantly it had a good plot. The Warrens were trying to uncover a curse. The demon was summoned by someone for some sinister reason and the Warrens sought to uncover it. It was risky business, but it was something they believed in.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Long waits with creepy tension and strange plot turns are still scary, but part 3 is like watching the first two. Part 3 turns into a mystery, which turns into a psychic investigation show.

12,deloudelouvain,"Third Conjuring and still of good quality, something that can't be said from all trilogies.",8,12 June 2021,"I see this sequel gets a lower rating than the previous two but to me it's of the same quality. It's another well made horror movie about demonic possession, a speciality of the Warrens, Ed and Lorraine, played again very good by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. There is a nice suspense building, some jump scares, some good tricks to keep the audience entertained and of course an evil story that is supposedly based on a true story. I say supposedly because in all fairness I can't see this story ever been happening like that. But to me it doesn't matter if it's a true story or just fiction (that's what I think it is), as long as it's entertaining and that's totally the case. This was the third Conjuring movie and for once the sequels don't get worse so that's also a bonus.

13,thesar-2,A Friend Made Me Watch This,4,6 June 2021,"If you must watch this, watch on HBO. Do NOT pay to see this in the theatre. It's totally not worth the risk of boredom.Okay, it's not that bad, but really, this isn't a movie anyone needs to see in the theatre.The movie begins with three flat-out lies: 1, it takes place in 1981. This movie, atmosphere, vibe, look and design screams 1971. Or hell, ANY time in the 1960's. The second and third lies were that this was ""the most sinister discovery of their career,"" followed by, naturally: ""Based on the true story.""Really, after a fairly fun cold open, it goes severely mellow until the ending and with a pretty easy, cut & dry case. If this was their ""most sinister discovery,"" then they lived real boing lives.And sure. As for the ""true"" bit...I believe SOME people may believe this really happened.Other than that, it's not terrible, though It has absolutely zero scares and the jump ""scares"" are so far predicted, you could do your own countdown. It's just a mystery and once revealed, it's soothing. Too bad you just have to sit through an over-long movie to get to satisfying resolution conclusion.If you believe in demonic possession, dark magic and the like, you might have more interest in this than me. The Original, O. G.hostbusters are back and after exorcising one demon, they failed to find any issue with the demon body hopping from one human to another. Oh, well. I bet that doesn't bite them in the arse later on...It was way better than the first unintentionally hilarious original, but 100x below Part 2. I rather really enjoyed Part 2.

14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,James Wan made him do it.,6,1 November 2021,"'The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021)' feels much more like a spin-off movie than a proper sequel, in terms of both quality and narrative. I appreciate the desire to do something a little different to the haunted houses of the previous two entries in the series, but this just ain't it, chief. The story is incredibly messy and inconsistent, ostensibly about the first American court case in which the defence claimed demonic possession as a mitigating factor but actually about a human Satanist using black magic to possess people in an effort to appease a demon she has summoned. It's, and I use this term loosely, the least believable of the three 'Conjuring' movies. Plus, it doesn't feel like something the Warrens themselves would have approved of (their dynamic is pushed to some pretty dark places). It seems to stray very far from the so-called 'facts' of the situation (which I'll admit I don't know too much about), sprinkling in elements from a variety of other cases that the Warrens were involved with around the same time. This does nothing other than distract from what should be the main focus of the flick. In all honesty, a courtroom drama would have been much more interesting and distinct. What we actually have feels like a schlocky supernatural detective story that hits all the beats you'd expect from a cheap seventies crime procedural with a supernatural gimmick. It's disappointing, for sure. It's also rather bland when it comes to its scares, utilising tried-and-tested techniques to typically subpar effect. Don't get me wrong, it's relatively enjoyable in a pulpy sort of way. The cast are as good as ever and the cinematography is satisfying. It's also better than a lot of similar fare. It just isn't even close to scary and is far less inspired than the two films it follows. It's far less engaging, too. The characters are nowhere near as well-rounded, which is perhaps the picture's second biggest issue. Its first is its lack of truly effective scare sequences.Something else that's worth mentioning is the fact that the flick's insistence on claiming it's based on a true story (which is weird considering how far it strays from the 'facts' of the situation it's based on) imbues it with a rather dangerous message. It actually goes quite a long way in absolving a killer, adding credence to the obviously bogus claim that demonic possession was responsible for the violence he inflicted. At best, the guy was mentally ill (as was, according to his own brother, the little boy whom the Warrens are depicted performing an exorcism on in the movie's opening moments) and, at worst, he was fully aware of his own actions. In reality, the guy got into a fight with his landlord and then stabbed him several times with a five-inch blade. If he was under the influence of anything, it was alcohol (his girlfriend is reported to have told her father something to the effect of ""he didn't mean to do it, you know how he gets when he's been drinking"".) That's all there is to it. Here comes this movie, though, that presents the demonic possession as real, essentially saying that justice wasn't served when the guy got sentenced to jail time for manslaughter because he really was being controlled by some sort of demon. It presents every sceptic as an absolute idiot wo endangers the lives of those around them when they refuse to accept the 'truth' about God and demons (i.e. When they aren't overtly Christian). Of course, the previous movies also present the demonic as real and take the Warrens at their word. The difference, though, is that the events depicted in the previous two films (apart from a brief segment focusing on the Amityville situation) only really have an effect on those who directly participated in them. Those real-life situations essentially mirror the films they're in, as both the film and the events it is based on are simply made-up stories designed to generate publicity for those involved. When they say ""based on true events"", you can simply reply ""no, you're not"" and enjoy them as fictional affairs. When something like this makes the same claim, however, it implicitly removes the culpability of those involved with the violent crimes it depicts. It It says ""hey, this guy really was innocent all along and the court was just too stupid to acknowledge that"". What it should say is ""thank goodness the court threw out such a blatantly false claim and properly tried the defendant for their crime"". This type of story also goes a fair way in regressing our understanding of mental illness, presenting it not only as a negative trait but as the literal embodiment of evil. In fact, it basically says that mental illness isn't real and, instead, must be a demonic presence. The previous two films could arguably fall into this latter trap, too, but their events are generally understood to have been fabricated by all those involved, rather than purely misinterpreted. As you can probably tell, there's a lot to say about the implication that the events this is based on are actually true. I won't discuss it further because I don't want this review to go on forever (it's long enough already) and also because I'm clearly not the most qualified person to be discussing the negative effects something like this could have on the public perception of mental illness and violent crime. It probably sounds like this aspect is a deal-breaker for me regarding this film, too, but it actually isn't. That's primarily because the whole 'devil made me do it' aspect of the piece is kind of secondary to its schlocky Satanist storyline. The focus is on saving the possessed guy rather than ensuring he doesn't get sentenced to any jail time. This is technically one of the film's faults, since it means that it's far less focused on its eponymous element than it should be, but I actually think it's ironically one of its strengths, as it allows it to divorce itself somewhat from the shaky moral ground that comes with its 'true story' tag. It doesn't completely absolve it, don't get me wrong. It just allows for an in-the-moment experience that isn't totally dominated but this aspect.In the end, the film is a messy and inconsistent entry in its series. It's enjoyable enough in a pulpy sort of way, though, and it's far from the worst that the overall franchise has to offer. Still, I doubt I'll be in a rush to revisit it. 6/10.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
15,Edvis-1997,6,6,8 July 2021,"I've been waiting for new part of conjuring and somehow it's really disappointing. When I saw queit place 2 yesterday it slightly disappointed me but this one was even worse. It has lack of action, no horror, very predictable, that priest is suspicious from the beginning. I can't understand how they didn't get any bad vibes from him,lol, that's just ridiculous. Special effects were bizarre in a bad way. This film cost only 39M$ which is even less than second part so we have what we have. It's sad that they've changed director and ruined their legacy.

16,Cineanalyst,Satanic Panic,4,14 June 2021,"What a disappointment after the impressively-reflexive sequel ""The Conjuring 2"" (2016), which realized all of the promise of the first ""Conjuring"" (2013), is ""The Devil Made Me Do It,"" the third installment in the series. Director James Wan and the Hayes screenwriting brothers weren't responsible for this one beyond Wan working on the story and producing, it seems, which suggests they were the talent holding up this franchise if this subordinate effort from their replacements is any indication. Departing from the haunted house formula isn't the problem--if anything it's a welcome reprieve--but after the opening scene of an exorcism being filmed by the Warrens' trusty technician, there's not much cinematic reflexivity, either. That's a problem. 1980s Satanic Panic is hardly compelling in itself.What we're left with is the clairvoyance of Vera Farmiga's Lorraine Warren--entering past scenes or mentally teleporting to other places, all of which is rather an extended acting metaphor, but even this isn't exploited here beyond replaying to lesser effect what was already done in the opening scene of the last movie. We don't even get the mirrors in this one. Instead, Mrs. Warren merely faces off against another clairvoyant, with predictably dull results.Otherwise, this one really misses the reflexive work of documenting their cases done by the Warrens and company in the prior pictures. They were essentially filmmakers within a film. In the first one, they then took their work on the lecture circuit. In the first sequel, it was television. Here, they try to prove their work in the courtroom--except that never actually happens, and they never collect any evidence for it. This is the same poorly-written scenario that features a priest lamenting and warned of the affect his room full of collected demonic instruments could have. It's the same sort of room that Ed Warren has been adding to throughout the series. The movie makes little of an interesting connection between the two, and the Warrens never think twice whether they might be creating a similar problem. And, for crying out loud, don't write cloying word vomit such as, ""She thinks our love is our weakness, but it's not... it's not; it's our strength."" Especially when you never bothered to establish that she ever thought love was their weakness in the first place. Very disappointing.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
17,ericstevenson,So mediocre,6,19 June 2021,"Wow, everyone seems to think this is just an okay film, so I'm going to say that exact same thing! So, the plot is that the movie begins with a kid being exorcised only to possess a teenager and the demon re-emerges months later and has the teen kill a guy. These people have to find out who summoned the demon. The movie begins and ends by saying that it's all based on a true story. I believe the person who inspired these movies wrote the book ""The Amityville Horror"" and it was proven he lied when he said it was based on a true story. I don't believe a word of this is real, nor do I believe in exorcism at all.I must, however, judge this on being a movie. The movie was probably too long and there seemed to be a lot of lighting problems. Everything was just so in the dark, but maybe there was something wrong with the theater I was in? It got dull, but I really do think there was good acting involved. It did seem to try to be realistic, but it would have been more interesting to learn about what happened at the trial. I mean, they never even say if it was legally declared that somebody was possessed by a demon! **1/2.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

I do also see that the timestamp of this case, 1981 and the span to the others doesnt consider the real aging of the actors, they try their best but the consept and ideas to make a seeworthy movie seems to run dry of sap.But its a watchable movie, with loads of devils and other knock wooders and plate throwing pjoltergeists that may make this an unconfortable show for some, cool for others. Its a great advantage knowing the past stories in the conjuring series, and the real history about the couple.Its a film valid on special effects, scare jumps, nice location settings and propmaking.

Therefore, I have to admit that it did not reach the two previous movies. I am not saying that it was a bad movie, I am saying that it was not as good as the two previous movies of ""The Conjuring"" franchise. For one more time the interpretations of both Vera Farmiga who played as Lorraine Warren and Patrick Wilson who played as Ed Warren were simply amazing. Another interpretation that have to be mentioned was Ruairi O'Connor's who played as Arne Cheyenne Johnson and he was equally good.

24,eddie_baggins,"Devoid of any iconic moments or significant scares, The Conjuring series is now DOA",4,7 June 2021,"With 2013's The Conjuring and its 2016 sequel The Conjuring 2, Australian Horror master James Wan created a modern day set of genre classics that provided eager audiences around the world a chance to partake in some iconic moments with its based on real figures Ed and Lorraine Warren with the two well-received films easily some of the best horror based products to be released since the 2000's began.Since the big money releases of those Wan films, the Conjuring universe has expanded in different ways to varying results with none of the spin-offs coming close to the all round quality of the two staple films as the various features either remained adequately mid-tier or even downright bad.Hope remained strong however that the return of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren in another legitimate Conjuring affair would bring this franchise back into the light but it appears as though the questionable quality of the off-shoot films has crept into the main events as the loss of Wan as a director has put one nail into the coffin off this series that at first did so much right.This time directed by Michael Chaves who last directed the terrible The Curse of la Llorona (one of the worst entries yet into the series), The Devil Made Me Do It has a great opportunity to keep things on the right track with an intriguing true story of Ruairi O'Connor's Arne Johnson basing his murder defense on being possessed and the Warren's trying to help prove that he indeed did face battles against dark forces but with a lack of scares, a narrative devoid of any memorable moments and a lack of story-telling nuance, the third film in the tale of the Warren's fails to breathe life into a quickly dwindling universe.With the first two Conjuring films providing us with such iconic and stand out moments as say the clapping game or Bill Wilkins reveal to investigators, one would be right to expect some great moments too be littered throughout this event but as we wait for any of these such moments to appear what is left in their places is nothing more but generic attempted jump scares, flying kitchen implements and most oddly of all a slippery morgue zombie that will likely make audiences laugh rather than wince in fear.It's almost embarrassing watching the talented Wilson and Farmiga going about their business here and while their presence elevates what would've otherwise been a bargain basement like effort, all the good will these two have earned as the Warrens through their various commitments to the series isn't enough to save Chave's film from itself with Wilson's walking cane/weak heart role in particular ruining a once great character and the films complete lack of genuine scares despite at times building tension for outcomes that never come making this a seriously generic and forgettable ride.It's hard to know where this series can now go, perhaps it is only Wan that could do anything to save it from itself but with his talents tied up elsewhere it does appear more than likely that this once bright horror franchise has burnt out for good.Final Say -Saved by a story that deserved better telling and the good will earnt from its two leads, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is a serious step back in quality for this series that now seems destined to produce nothing but forgettable products from here on out.2 flying plates out of 5.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

26,SAMTHEBESTEST,The Conjuring 3 remains faithful to its franchise values and continues haunting the viewers with the same impact.,6,29 July 2021,"The Conjuring : The Devil Made Me Do It (2021) :-
Movie Review -Horror is one of the most interesting genre in Hollywood even with sub-genres like Supernatural-horror, sci-fi-horror and horror-thriller. We don't see lots of films in this genre but there are always few in between to provide us some different kind of entertainment. It has evolved rationally you know, i mean right from German Classic 'Noaferatu' to 'Phantom Of The Opera' (1925) to Frankenstein' (1931) to 'Dracula' (1931) and then to modern classic and box office monster like 'The Exorcist'. The definition of this genre has changed too later with the addition of Sci-fi elements with films like 'Alien' (1979) & 'The Thing' (1982). Today, we see completely different films based on novel and true stories and certainly The Conjuring is one of the most watched franchise. The previous two films (not including Anabelle) were loved by the audience and have set a standard for the franchise. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It arrived with the responsibility of living upto that standard and i am glad to say that it does deliver what promised. The film remains utterly faithful to its genre and carry forwards the horrifying legacy successfully.Like predecessors, this one is also based on a true story which gives it authenticity in this unnatural genre of storytelling. It is based on the trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, a murder trial that took place in 1981 Connecticut, in addition to The Devil in Connecticut, a book about the trial written by Gerald Brittle. The opening scene is extremely scary and that hooks you into the narrative for next 100 minutes. There are no boring moments at all, instead there are few cliches which comes with certain amount of interesting backdrop. It goes deep into the matter with the help exorcism and supernatural powers while the main course of God's will remains the most vital part throughout the storyline. The use of power of love to bring back the real character to life works fantastically in the climax.Vera Farmiga is more convincing and reliable in this film than before. May be the characterization has helped but whatever it is, it simply connects. Patrick Wilson is as good as he was with the additional variation in the climax when he turns into a demon. In supporting role Ruairi O'Connor is fine and the rest of the cast does fairly decent. The Conjuring has always been about technical brilliance more than the actors and director which always keeps it in a safe zone. Doesn't matter if the writing fails once in a while because technical advances would always lifts it up.Definitely it's horrifying and scary enough to make you jump from the seat but how far you can hold is a matter of individual patience. Weak hearted people should not watch it and the hard-core fans should definitely enjoy it. That accurate use of background music, dark sets, camera angles, unbearable visuals of exorcism and atmospheric sounding everything makes it a watchful film. Michael Chaves couldn't match James Wan but he has done everything possible that any other director could have done. Most importantly, he didn't drag it and that's the best quality about his direction. We all are getting used to this stuff with every film of The Conjuring Cinematic Universe and yet it don't bore you. That's a big triumph for the team you know. Overall, another good film in the horror Universe with every single trademark of terrifying experience.RATING - 6/10*",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

28,paul-allaer,"""My client pleads not guilty by reason of demonic possession""",6,6 June 2021,"As ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" (2021 release; 111 min.) opens, it is ""July 18, 1981"" and Ed and Lorraine are with David, an 8 yr. Old boy possessed by the devil, and his family. The devil in David goes fully ballistic. Arne, the boyfriend of David's sister, screams: ""TAKE ME!"" and for some reason the devil complies. That is when the real problems start for Arne.... At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the movie. You'll have to see for yourself how t all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the 8th movie in the Conjuring Universe, and also the most recent one chronologically. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are once again back as Ed and Lorrain Warren. What intrigued me about this particular movie is that this brings the first legal case even in this country where a defendant in an alleged murder case pleads not guilty by reason of ""demonic possession"". As noted in the movie, this defense had been used twice before in the UK in recent years before 1981. As for the ""scary scenes"", well of course there is absolutely nothing scary about them, unless you think a ""scary jump"" is scary,. Not to mention that the orchestral score is a dead giveaway: when the violins start playing dramatically, you know something ""Scary"" is about to happen. Still I enjoyed it for what it was. The curators of the Conjuring Universe have perfected their art, and this movie was well made, period. (As a complete aside, it is astonishing to see how successful the Conjuring Universe has been from a financial perspective. Looking at it from the creative perspective, it's okay, nothing more, nothing less.)""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" opened this weekend in theaters AND also started streaming on HBO Max (where I caught it). If you've seen one the Conjuring franchise movies before and like it, by all means come check out ""The Devil Made Me DO It"" as well. If you didn't like it, then please don't both with this one either. If you've never seen a Conjuring franchise movie before, this is as good an entry point as any (besides the very first Conjuring movie).",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
29,subxerogravity,"Loved it, but making a Conjuring Universe took the scares' out of this.",7,4 June 2021,"Not the end of the world that I was not scared watching a horror movie. If you are the type to watch a lot you do get to the point where it may take a little more to frighten you, but I was surprised that I got no jump out of my seat moments, nothing gave me the willies or the chills. The best they gave me was suspense.What I did get was a lot of oh snap moments. An oh snap moment when Annabelle was referenced. An oh snap moment as you see the Warren's children older and getting into the game. An oh snap moment where Lorraine Warren uses her powers for a more light hearted moment and an oh snap moment when the Warrens meet a Kinard spirit.These are the things that make up a film franchise universe, something that I feel the movie celebrates more than anything else. We are here to see the Warrens battle evil more than we are here to see the evil they battle, and I'm all for it. If Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were 30 years younger and we put Wilson in some ruby red shades, they could be Cyclops and Jean Grey from the superhero franchise, X-Men.I was not expecting the change in direction the Conjuring took cause it's not a horror movie, it's more of a Crime Drama with horror elements as the Warrens attempt to get a lighter sentence for young man who murdered some people by proving...The Devil Made him do it (that's why they picked that subtitle).Despite the change in genre, I'm still feeling this movie.

I could tell even just from the trailer than James Wan's absence was going to be noticeable and significant. I hoped I was wrong - but I wasn't. To be fair I think that this story wasn't strong enough for him to touch anyway.The story here felt really forced. What would've been interesting was to focus on the court case and how the defense of ""Demonic Possession"" would have held up. That's the movie I would've liked to see, however I understand that wouldn't have fit in with the horror genre the fans come to associate with 'The Conjuring' universe. All of the horror in this movie was ridiculous though. All the subtlety the original film had is completely gone.The movie felt incredibly safe too. The film attained an R rating, however it could easily have scraped in at PG-13. What the 'Conjuring' universe has become in my mind is introduction horror for teenagers. Not once during this film did my heart-rate rise.The only thing that keeps the film afloat is the characters of Ed and Lorraine Warren, and more importantly their charismatic performances by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga.

Plenty of in your face jump scares this time, I preferred the more unsettling horror of the previous films. Didn't think much of the CGI child exorcism at the start either, plus the plot gets really far fetched and hard to swallow at times. And the British release is cut for a 15 certificate.

This one is based on the true story of the first time that the demonic possession defense was used in a US court of law. It takes place in the early 1980's when Patrick & Vera are investigating a possession of a little boy, which leads to the possession of Ruairi, a friend of the little boy's family. Ruairi kills his landlord and doesn't remember anything. Vera's clairvoyance comes in handy in trying to determine the source of the demonic possession and John plays a priest that has answers to how the cases-and a few others-are all connected.

The storyline for this is very interesting. The horror elements are excellent and the special effects were awesome for the most part (except a few over embellishments in the final few scenes). The acting is very good but I found myself only caring about the Warrens. They didn't focus enough on the possessed family's backstory to make you care about them.

Contains several eye-rolling nods to ""The Exorcist and A Nightmare on Elm St.Nevertheless, the Warren couple are still in top ghost-hunter power-couple form. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are still as charming as ever together which gives this muted Conjuring film just enough goodwill to keep our attention despite this being a scary movie that doesn't scare. Wilson and Farmiga do a seamless job at stepping into these characters, and their persistent dedication at providing an authentic portrayal makes the wonkier elements of this sequel tolerable.There are a few standout inventive sequences of action that are relatively exciting. There is a good movie in here somewhere. The cast wants to do well. Wilson and Farmiga attempt to take charge of the material. You can feel it right under the surface.The basic fundamental of love triumphing over evil is the crux for ""The Devil Made Me Do It"" and Wilson and Farmiga have the energy and presence to make audiences both care about their adventures and yearn for another case.

43,aidanratesmovies,People are missing the point with this one,10,5 June 2021,"As an atheist, i've spent my time during this franchise oddly enjoying the movies at hand- especially the previous two conjuring films themselves, but never befoe have I watched suched a movie that would make me want to believe that there is truly a God. Although I can see where many critics stand on this film, in whole, I absolutely loved this movie, and is perhaps my second favorite film in the franchise all together. I was very nervous ahead of this film. I loved the first two conjuring films immensely, and when I heard Wan was not directing the film I was very skeptical to how good it could possibly be- especially with Michael Chaves as the director- who also happened to direct my least favorite film in the franchise The Curse of La Llorona. Chave's, thankfully, steps it up a notch with this one- and truly does a phenomenal job directing. The atmosphere is as great as ever in this film, and Chaves truly recognizes the tone that the film needs almost immediately. Many people are griping on this film because of its lack of scares, but considering the plot and story at hand, I wouldn't say it truly needed them. The film is easily as intense as it needs to be with the script at hand, and shoe-horning jump scares and stuff like they did with the nun in the last film clearly doesn't need to be applied to this film. Its creepy, dark, and suspenseful on tone alone- and its actors, as dedicated as they are, truly make every little frightening thing as believable as ever. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as the Warren's are as great as always, and truly are the heart of this film and the franchise in whole, and I was overjoyed how they were recognized as so throughout the film. Ruairi O'Connor and Julian Hilliard also provide excellent and tuly emotional performances throughout- bringing their characters to life in the most empathetic of ways. In the end, I enjoyed the hell out of The Conjuring 3 no pun intended, and I think if more people understand the movie for what it is- you'll love it too.My Rating: 9.6/10Sidenote: Also loved the references to other horror flicks, like The Shining, The Exorcist, and A Nightmare on Elm Street- didn't affect the movie at all but fun little easter eggs nevertheless.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

I'll be honest, when I saw the title, I wasn't the biggest fan and this will be something that I get into later. This is also one that I heard some mixed things about, but I did pretty well with avoiding spoilers for it aside from a few minor things. To get into this sequel, the Warrens investigate a murder that may be linked to a demonic possession.We are starting this movie back in 1981. Ed (Patrick Warren) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) are helping out the Glatzel family. The son of David (Julian Hilliard) is possessed. Trying to help see him through are his sister Debbie (Sarah Catherine Hook), her boyfriend Arne Cheyenne Johnson (Ruairi O'Connor) along with his mother Judy (Charlene Amoia) and father Carl (Paul Wilson). It appears an exorcism has been approved by the church so they're waiting on Father Gordon (Steve Coulter) to arrive. We see that the demonic presence isn't though. A dangerous exorcism takes place that almost kills Ed. Before he passes out from a heart attack, he sees Arne help David by allowing the demon in.Ed is rushed to the hospital where Lorraine, Judy (Sterlin Jerins) and Father Gordon check on him. Life seems to go back to normal for the Glatzels. Not so much for Arne though. He is seeing things in the house and he is also not feeling well. This pushes him to almost getting hurt at work and killing his landlord, landing him in jail as he awaits trial.The Warrens approach his lawyer, Meryl (Ashley LeConte Campbell) about his defense and she gives them the cold hard facts, it would be nearly impossible to prove that he was possessed when he committed murder. They invite her to dinner to change her mind and she does enter a plea that Arne killed this man due to demonic possession. In order to help his case, they will have to do something they've never done before; after the facts prove that he was possessed. Things are even more difficult where Arne is able to touch religious symbols and read from the bible while in jail.Lorraine makes an interesting discovery under the Glatzels' house that leads them toward the truth of what is going on. There was another similar case that could also give them more information. What they discover could be much more dangerous than anything they've dealt with before.That is where I'm going to leave my recap for this movie. Where I want to start is this being based on a 'true story'. I will admit I haven't looked into this case. I do believe that the Warrens helped out the Glatzel family and that there really is a case file. I don't believe that they did most of what happened into this movie. It is based on real people and recounting some real events, or at least their version. I don't want to delve too much more into this or how the Warrens were in real life, but I wanted to at least point out this here to start.Going from there, before seeing this movie I did see some images pointing out how much of this movie is borrowing from The Exorcist. We get an interesting variation on the legendary image that would become the poster within the first 5 minutes of the movie. I thought it was a good touch. Another comparison could be the fact that we get an exorcism that doesn't go as planned with a character calling the demon into themselves. Now I do apologize if I'm spoiling the classic from the 1970's, but this all happens within the first 10 minutes of this movie. I don't think it hurts this movie as it is hard to not pay homage to such a ground-breaking film.For the story here, we get an interesting premise. This feels a lot like The Exorcism of Emily Rose in that we're trying to prove demonic possession in a court of law. This movie here doesn't use the court room nearly as much so that doesn't bog it down. I should point out though, I really like Emily Rose. What is really here is giving us the uphill battle that the Warrens have to climb in order to help Arne. It works in the movie's favor doing this back in the 1980's, where we are more in the Satanic Panic and could potentially sway a jury more than you could today in my opinion. We also know much more about mental illness than we did then too.Now something you have to do with sequels is constantly raise the stakes. I like that is what we're doing here. We looked at the Enfield Poltergeist in the previous movie and also used The Nun as the major villains there. In order to go bigger, I like that we're dealing with a demon that someone summoned with the occult. There is a much bigger plot to explain everything, but that is what it boils down to. I was on board with the concept. Some thing else I want to include here is that I like we limit Ed in this movie due to his heart attack. It isn't just a plot device to allow the haunting to progress, it is a nagging thing.The last part of the story that I will bring up is something else I saw people griping about. There isn't necessarily stakes for Ed and Lorraine. There is a sequence in the trailer, which in part is why I don't watch trailers. This movie does have the haunting shift over to them as it is trying to stop them during their investigation. My take for this though is that it is the family's they are helping are the ones in danger. The Warrens need to save them before it is too late. I'm fine that it does shift to them, even when they aren't with the family, but I never feel they're truly in peril. This is an issue with a series like this with 'iconic' characters.Speaking of which, I think I'll go to the acting next. I like Wilson and Farmiga in these roles. I feel like they've taken them over. I know Ed and Lorraine were real, but these are the cinematic version that are much different from the actual people. I don't think they're performance is great here, but I feel they a legit married couple that likes to help people. I thought that O'Connor was solid as Arne. There is something about him where he's timid so I like where his character ends up. Hook is cute and I thought she was good as Arne's love interest who is sticking by him. Hilliard is fine as the boy. He does some good stuff during the possession scene and there after. John Noble is really creepy from the moment we meet him as Kastner. This could also be said about Eugenie Bondurant in her role. Aside from that, I thought the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed.I think next I'll go to the effects. There is quite a bit of CGI here, being that this is a big budget haunting and possession movie. What I will say is that it actually worked for me. They do some creepy things that pop up behind characters and from shadows, which I will also credit the cinematography. There was some creepy stuff with body contortion that works. There are also some decent practical effects mixed in I'm sure. Overall I'd say that it worked for me.Then finally I want to briefly talk about the sound design. I think it does some really good stuff with demonic whispering and roaring. That stuff fits and is creepy. I think that the soundtrack, especially the use of the Blondie song was good. My only issue comes from the stingers with the jump-scares. I'm not going to rant, it just feels cheap. I will say, there was one that startled me a bit so I will give credit to that.So then in conclusion here, I think that this is an enjoyable movie. Do I think it is ground breaking? No I do not. This is an entertaining film that I think is pretty well done. Being based on a true story is a bit laughable to me. I do think we have the stakes raised from the previous movie. We have an interesting story we're following and the acting works to bring the characters to life. I think that the effects were good, the cinematography works and I'm mostly positive on the sound design. This movie is just lacking a bit for me with where things go. If you like The Conjuring universe, then definitely watch this one to continue the story. There are better and scarier haunting/possession films out there.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
46,jadepietro,The Devil May Care. I Didn't.,5,15 June 2021,"IN BRIEF: A supernatural tale of demon-possessing that loses its grip as both a horror film and crime thriller.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED)The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is an absurd title for an absurd movie. It's a standard horror film trope about demons, ghosts, witches, and exorcisms, with enough cheap scares, grisly special effects, and eerie-sounding music to satisfy any horror film fan.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles in the third chapter from The Conjuring series as Ed and Lorraine Warren, two paranormal investigators who take on a case of murder and supernatural mayhem. Purportedly based on ""true"" events on July 18, 1981 to be exact, the couple witness the exorcism of eight-year-old David Glatzel. To say that this incident went south is an understatement. Just as Arne Johnson who was there and later accused of murder. Was he drunk? Or was it evil demons? Blame the Coors.The opening scene is a knock-out of tension and very effective CGI moments, but everything else from that point rarely reaches that level of assurance and skill. From there, the screenplay follows a predictable route as horror films go, but an unpredictable route as a crime thriller when the Warrens ask Arne to plea not guilty due to demonic possession. An interesting case of mitigating circumstances? Blame the judicial system.Director Michael Chaves uses silence and strong images most expertly to build his suspense. Cereal boxes mysteriously move off shelves. Faucets turn on by themselves. Waterbeds explode. Just a typical day in the neighborhood. But don't go into the cellar! (And call the exterminator already!) As the murder investigation slowly unfolds, so does the unconvincing story by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick. One store-bought cliché follows the next. Past and present events collide which leads our sleuthing duo to yet another haunting demon-possession story, which never truly gels. The fragmented movie suddenly becomes a police crime thriller, forsaking its haunted house origins. Bad decision. Blame the writer with a very long name.Despite the good acting by Mr. Wilson and Ms. Farmiga and the fine atmospheric cinematography of Michael Burgess, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It wants to be taken seriously.. But believe me, there is enough blame to go around in this convoluted otherworldly tale. Blame yourself if you see this muddle. (GRADE: C)",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
47,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It,6,30 October 2021,"I saw the first Conjuring flick and I thought it was meh. I've never seen the second Conjuring installment (aptly titled The Conjuring 2). Now it's Halloween and yeah, I might as well watch a little fright fare. Why not The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. I mean why not.Anyway ""Devil"" is a modern-day horror pic even though it takes place in 1981. I say it's modern-day because it has those jump scares that are seen so often and don't really terrify you internally. There's also that MTV-style editing we see so much of in today's fear fest assembly line (in MTV's defense, they did start their inception in '81).Finally, there's that whole follow-up faze and revisiting of stuff from years past. Examples: The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It has an opening shot that feels like something out of The Exorcist. Added to that, the possessed dude in ""Devil"" looks like the possessed dude in Amityville II: The Possession (Sonny Montelli). And just for kicks and giggles, the afreet in ""Devil"" targets a family just like in those Paranormal Activity vehicles. Need I say more.""Devil"" is a June 2021 release that has the look and texture of an episode of Paranormal Witness. It chronicles the Warrens (who else?) as they investigate the demonic bewitching of a young, contortionist man who committed murder. ""Devil"" is directed by Michael Chaves, a sort of meat and potatoes filmmaker whose 3rd Conjuring is decently well-made and suitably plotted. Sadly though, we've seen this whole movie before (no pun intended).""Devil"" is a sequel of a sequel that knows it's a sequel. It's a continuation of something prosaic, a new chapter of real-life paranormal investigators who just happen to stumble upon some more demonic mumbo jumbo. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga do a decent job in their Warren portrayals. But if what's on screen isn't bone-chillingly scary, there's no need to ""conjure"" up anything but a mixed review.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
48,vengeance20,The Conjuring 3 (2021),5,29 May 2021,"Was anticipating this film for a long while & was supposed to be released in September 2020, but due to Covid-19 was pushed back to the 26th May, 2021. The film I think is the weakest of the 3!Thew film follows a young man Arne Cheyenne Johnson who in September of 1981, murdered a man named Bruno at a Dog Shelter by stabbing him 22 times! Ed & Lorraine Warren go to investigate to try & clear the mans name as he was under demonic possession during the incident!I found the film to be more story orientated than scares & action, which for me was where the film lost it's way considering the previous 2 films. The story while interesting wasn't all that great & the scenes jumping around just muddied the waters & made things some what confusing/hard to follow. The scares & visuals were little to non existent & I didn't feel the demon ion this film was all that scary or even remotely sinister looking.The film dragged at 1 hour & 46 minutes, the pacing itself didn't help. The film itself wasn't nearly as intense as The Conjuring 2, never mind the first The Conjuring which is better than this by a long shot. I even heard some sampled Scoring from The Purge in a couple of scenes. The title itself is too long & should've been called The Conjuring 3, it's cleaner just saying.Overall it's the weakest entry in The Conjuring franchise hands down, maybe try & be more action & scares than story or better yet, get a good mix so it's well executed film cause this entry is completely overrated for what it is.5/10.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
49,elliotjeory,Underwhelming,5,6 June 2021,"The first two conjuring films set a bar and this one didn't match it. The story wasn't particularly good and it wasn't scary. It's not a bad film, there's worse entries in the conjuring universe such as The Nun and Annabelle 3, however there's something missing from this film and it leaves you a little disappointed.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
50,Abdulxoxo,The weakest entry in the conjuring universe so far,6,8 June 2021,"Like the first two films, this one is again loosely based on a true story. Ed and Lorraine Warren are called upon to help exorcise a demon from a young boy. This would lead to the demon passing into another body, whom it would use to commit a murder. The case would go to court, where it would be the first example of a defence of demonic possession being made. It's then down to the Warrens to investigate and somehow try to prove, to a legal standard, the existence of demons.That plot makes this film sound so much more interesting than it actually was. To be fair, the opening act was good. The whole exorcism sequence was nicely staged and effectively creepy. The performances from Wilson and Farmiga were typically impressive. From there you would think the film will go somewhere but it's unfortunately downhill after that. The performances of Wilson and Farmiga continued to be good throughout. The score wasn't bad either. However, the story this time felt surprisingly dull. The main focus of the plot in fact revolved around a curse, which had been cast by an evil spirit. This has the core concept to be a much better film than it turned out to be. The jump scares were all predicable. The supporting characters were boring. The main villain left no lasting impact. When compared to the first two Conjuring films, this one just felt like a disappointment.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
51,arungeorge13,"Entertaining to an extent, still the weakest in the trilogy! [+51%]",5,4 June 2021,"The Conjuring movies have gone on to be heavily dependent on Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's believable chemistry over all else. In the current instalment too, that's the case. We jump right into the middle of an exorcism scene at the start, leaving no room to breathe. It's well crafted, impactful, and sufficiently scary - the kind that leaves you thinking ""well, if this is the appetizer, the main course should be out of this world"". But the effect isn't sustained.Now, director Michael Chaves and his writer David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick get a few things right. Firstly, this film veers away from the by-now-overused haunted house setting and explores the outside world to a fair extent. Secondly, there's a plot point involving Ed's heart condition that's consistent throughout the film and adds to the list of regular human issues (aside from demonic i.e.). Thirdly, the proceedings never get boring. Though quite a few scares are predictable and follow the same pattern (of muted score and transitioning colour palettes), I felt fully invested in what Ed and Lorraine were always up to.The list of drawbacks is slightly more extensive, however. The main antagonist here isn't very creepy, neither is her backstory that dark or intense. Once again, the lack of standout scenes is a bit of a worry. Take the ""clap"" scene from the first instalment or the ""Nun's painting"" scene from the second - it's difficult to forget either for the visual impact alone - we get NONE of that kind here! The climactic showdown here is the weakest among all three, with no real underlying tension. While the story kicks off with the Arne Johnson incident, it becomes evident that this alone wouldn't suffice for an interesting 2-hour fare, so they club it with another fictional murder.For Michael Chaves, this is definitely a leap (in terms of craft and vision) from his La Llorona outing. There's still a lot of ground to cover before he can truly get to Wan's level. At this point, a Conjuring film is more about the lead couple's cute camaraderie than all the exorcisms and manifestations.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
52,omendata,Basic horror but more of a thriller,6,6 June 2021,"Watched this last night in the dark with the surround sound turned up to the max but it is just not scary at all and pales into insignificance when compared to the first two movies.Add to this, the fact it felt more like an episode of X-Files or CSI mixed in with some Amityville Horror without the horror element and it really does not hit the heights expected from some of the glowing online reviews , which i surmise now might just be paid shills, which is becoming the norm sadly these days.Farmiga and co always give a good acting performance but sadly it is just above average so gets a fair 6 hatchets out of ten from me on this one!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

But as a movie this is still good, because full of scary things all taken from real life encounters in religion, science, cultures, news. I see here somehow older and different Sterling Jerins and Vera Farmiga, I expected them to look both younger and more pretty. Bad is too desperate and amateur or common and too random scary effects and ideas. I expected something more scientific, clear, detailed, but instead it uses just brief explanation and not convincing like in most amateur movies. Good is that at least there is something new, different, still scary and mysterious and based on real life phenomena which even I could encounter like curses, rituals, religion, exorcism, hallucinations, crime and bad news stories.

The production, the acting, the sound, is all great, but the writing and more importantly the talent to tell a horror story ""based on reality"" (slightly based on reality) is just not there here.So yeah, it's never boring per se, but it's also never particularly great at anything. The new characters are all super flat (when in the first ones were all loveable and we really feel for their suffering), the jumpscares and ""horror sequences"" are fine but never great, and the movie ends up being just forgettable, which would be ok for ""The Nun"", but it is a shame for ""The Conjuring"" saga.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Ed & Lorraine investigate a murder, that may have happened due to a demonic possession.The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is an amazing film. Director Michael Chaves has effectively taken over directing duties from James Wan. Chaves has given us a much better movie than The Curse of La Llorona(2019), which was his previous directorial effort & also a part of the Conjuring universe. This film doesn't deserve all the negative reception coming its way. It's on par with The Conjuring 2(2016), though The Conjuring(2013) is still the best movie in the franchise. This film may be low on jump scares but, it is filled with suspense, a growing feeling of dread & power-packed performances. Patrick Wilson is fantastic as Ed Warren. Vera Farmiga is spectacular as Lorraine Warren. Ruairi O'Connor is outstanding as Arne Cheyenne Johnson. Sarah Katherine Hook is brilliant as Debbie Glatzel. Julian Hilliard is phenomenal as David Glatzel. The supporting cast is excellent. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is a must watch for fans of the Conjuring franchise.

61,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,One of the better Conjuring films.,7,5 June 2021,"This film will go down as one of the better films from The Conjuring franchise. It does have a creepy build up and plenty of jump scares. It even pays homenaje to The Exorcist (1973). We see that early in the film when Father Gordon gets out of the taxi wearing a hat, looking up at the house and the lightpost in the frame just like the movie poster of The Exorcist.The film, however, is more about witchcraft and the black magic arts than the Warrens confronting the Devil. I really like the close loving relationship between Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson in this film. I really enjoyed their strong love for each other as Lorraine and Ed Warren. That relationship on camera is what made the film good for me. The chance that one of them or both could die going up against this witch made it hair-raising fare, especially when you see how much love they had for each other.The film has atypical horror & exorcism tropes such as flickering lights, blistering skin, double jointed crawl walks etc. Nothing groundbreaking in the possession or witchcraft subgenre. But I didn't mind too much because the production values was high and again, that strong performance between Farmiga and Wilson showed on screen.In all, I liked it. The supporting actors were all good and the witch was scarier to me than Valak, the demonic nun. The camera work was excellent. As someone else mention, I agree the film could have used more details. It could have used a deeper more complex story to draw the smart horror lovers in. But its a good scary flick in May. I am glad we didn't have to wait until October to see its release.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

64,RonellSowes,Snoozefest,3,12 June 2021,"This movie fails on so many different levels that it's hard to just list them all. Probably the foremost one is the that it can't even do the number one thing it intends to, frighten. I don't think most horror movies are, but this pictures attempts are downright pathetic. Relying on the same contrived techniques that seem to circulate through all these movies while also copying some of the classics in the genre e.g. An ending sequence very reminiscent of The Shining. On top of the scares not being able to deliver, the movie doesn't even have the texture or style to make it ominous or forbidding.As a horror movie this picture doesn't succeed and as a film it might even do worse. All of the secondary stories or themes are pretty pathetic and do nothing towards the advancement of the picture-besides ferling like the unnecessary baggage that they are. They don't make you care about the characters a bit more and neither do any of these scenes provide any of the entertainment that the horror scenes don't.

65,kjproulx,It Doesn't Feel Like The First Two Films At All,6,15 June 2021,"Back when The Conjuring hit the big screen in 2013, I thought James Wan directed one of the better mainstream horror films in years. I then thought that The Conjuring 2 was possibly even superior, so naturally, I was excited about a third instalment. Now available in theatres and at home, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is an average film overall, with some very solid moments. Something just felt off about it. Easily the weakest of the trilogy, here's why I think you can skip this one.The film opens with a scene that could've easily been the climax of one of the other films. I was shocked to see it start so quickly. It opens with David, a possessed little boy, as Ed and Lorraine Warren are once again investigating a possible curse. Arne, David's older brother, wishes the curse to take him over instead. Fully listening to that request, the demon latches itself onto Arne and makes things much worse. Ed in recovery after this incident, Lorraine becomes more of the focal point of the story here. If it wasn't for their presence, this film would've felt like just another average possession story.Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson have always been the best part of all three of these films, but there was a great story to back them up as well. This time around, too many little details were happening during this case. This in turn made the film feel a little jumbled to me. It never felt like it was going anywhere until the end. This may have been one of their biggest cases in reality, but I don't think it worked as a movie all that well. That's not to say it's a bad film, it's just that it lacked the look and feel of the previous two.James Wan did a fantastic job directing the first two films and while I believe that Michael Chaves did a solid job here, especially with a few very well-done scenes in the forest and hallways, it just felt like it had a completely different feel. On top of that, writer David Leslie Johnson has also been hit-or-miss for me throughout his career. I really believe it comes down to who he works with on each project. Other than The Conjuring 2 and Aquaman, I haven't liked any of his previous screenplays. I think he's a very talented writer, given the right support.Overall, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It suffers from a look and tone that doesn't feel as authentic as the last two films. Ed and Lorraine are both great again here and they share some terrific scenes together, but again, I didn't care too much because the story happening around them wasn't all that compelling. There was too much trying to be said here and I think feel that the film suffers as a result. If you're a massive fan of this franchise (even the spin-offs like The Nun or Annabelle) then you might get a kick out of this one too, but I just thought this film was a huge step down in comparison. On its own, it's a fine horror flick, but that's not the standard that the last two set. I'll give the movie a pass for having some impressive scenes, but the overall movie is very, very average.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
66,kuarinofu,Saved by the power of love,5,5 June 2021,"Well, I think we can all say goodbye to the franchise. They buried it intentionally by giving it to the director of La Llorona. And we all know how great of a horror that film was.There were many things I did not particularly like in this film.1. The occultist (or the witch) was a great cast yet we were given so little information about her it almost doesn't matter. Although she reminded me of Delilah Copperspoon if you know what I mean.2. The story, while trying to be different and fresh, still didn't go too far from the basic concepts, so we got two different ones, a demon one and an occult witch one. This heavily muffled the rules and the powers of the entity and the witch, which were never clear. So you cannot really tell when the witch is real, and why she can do what she does, and so on.3. The scares are on par with La Llorona - mostly scary-faced people charging towards the camera. There was no tension, no build-up. Nothing was subtle enough and even the new tricks and toys they've set up don't do much.4. Plus tons of plot holes and continuity. Many things change between cuts, the ending was only made possible because the witch disappeared from her altar, and the Warrens appeared there. She was easily defeated even though she can teleport through locked doors, shapeshift and mind control.Maybe if we would have more of her backstory and some of her abilities pre-established, this would've worked better. We didn't get anything on the demon as well.The witch's motivation was unclear, what exactly besides ""power"" would she get, why did she choose these specific people, why did she kill her father at all? How could she live basically inside his house with him never knowing about it? Why would they waste so much time on exorcism if it never worked on the demon anyway, even in the end? Why does she have to manually mind control people if the demon can do this as well? I guess she can teleport and shapeshift by herself, but to control other people through the demon she needs an altar? Why did the demon decide that she failed with the souls, only because the altar was cracked? Was there a time limit?Anyway. There are still redeeming qualities in this one. The Warrens are back, they do actual investigative stuff, we get more of their backstory, some of the humorous moments were ok. Although if it was made about random people and not the Warrens, it would've become a very generic and non-scary horror film.It's a 50/50 recommendation, if you love the Conjuring films you will probably watch it anyway, but not enjoy it so much. If you are not familiar with these, it will mostly be boring for you.P. S. Does paying homage to the classic Exorcist scene make you smart in 2021?

This third installment wasn't from James Wan, and the difference was clear. The scares devolved into basic jump scares that lacked tension. Also, the creativity wasn't there anymore. Although the story was different from the previous two, it didn't make the movie much better.The savior of this movie was the strong acting from the Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as the Warrens.

It completely ramps up the jumpscares and despite being entirely predictable they still work, take for example the scene where a boy jumps on a waterbed and ""something"" happens to him, we knew there was going to be a jump but it still works.The plot's not bad, it's (very loosely) based on a true story and is rather straightforward, there's one or two twists but nothing too much. The acting's pretty solid like usual and the special effects are excellent, it's a shame there wasn't too many different monsters in this one but the main cultist villain was actually really well done and intimidating.7/10: Just about earns a 7, a solid watch and it's good fun.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

The jump scares were obvious and the plot was basic and predictable. It was all over the place and combined with the fact there wasn't too many actual scares it never felt like there was too much danger or risk. I thought I was going to watch a horror movie but saw a love story instead. Movie End credits freaked more than movie itself.

70,msbreviews,"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is undoubtedly the weakest installment of the trilogy, but it's still far from the awful level of the worst films of the horror saga.",6,6 June 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I've always questioned myself why The Conjuring Universe possesses more spin-offs than main titles since The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 are, by far, the best films of the popular horror franchise. Looking at the numbers, The Nun holds the box office record, being the most successful movie of the saga financially, but ironically enough, it's also the most disliked film by both critics and audience members. The viral marketing campaign obviously hyped this spin-off to an unbelievable level of expectation, but it's still strange that it took five years to deliver another The Conjuring flick since both previous installments were tremendously profitable as well.With James Wan out of the director's chair and without a screenplay credit, my expectations weren't exactly high. Wan is one of the main reasons why The Conjuring movies work so well. From his ability to generate an enormous amount of suspense to the actually scary atmosphere, Wan is definitely one of the best horror directors of the last decade. Therefore, replacing him would always be a challenging task. Michael Chaves directed The Curse of La Llorona, a generic, bland horror flick that didn't have a single surprising element. However, I did compliment Chaves' work with the horror sequences since I did find them somewhat effective. So, I was still feeling optimistic about The Devil Made Me Do It...It's admittedly the weakest film of the trilogy, but it's still far from the awful Annabelle Comes Home or the hideous origin story about the famous nun. When it comes to the main titles, the exceptional production value is something all have in common. In fact, this latest flick is arguably the best-looking one. The horror sequences look stunning on the big screen, and the sound design is extremely impactful as always. It's worth remembering that this franchise doesn't waste hundreds of millions to make its movies, being a relatively low-budget cinematic universe, especially when compared to every other studio's massive sagas. Practical effects are always the go-to if possible, keeping the use of CGI to the minimum.Acting-wise, it's also where these films triumph. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga share palpable chemistry, deeply elevating their characters' emotional connection. At its core, The Conjuring features a love story between Ed and Lorraine Warren, ultimately being their grounded, convincing, loving relationship that keeps the viewers interested in the least ""based on a true story"" events. Both actors deliver remarkable performances, as does the legendary John Noble (The Lord of the Rings, Fringe) as a former priest. I didn't know about his casting before the movie, so I was genuinely surprised by seeing Noble on the big screen again. He's absolutely phenomenal, as expected, and quite creepy as a mysterious character.Everyone else is decent enough, but I don't find any other interpretation worth noting. Unfortunately, this is as far as I can go compliment-wise. The primary narrative surrounding the actual case that gives the name to the film is nowhere near as interesting as the stories told in the previous The Conjuring movies. The case itself doesn't have much to tell, so the majority of the film rests on following the beloved couple going on side quests as detectives. Eventually, the clues found are connected to the main plot, but overall, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay isn't that captivating. Despite the predictability and formulaic horror elements, there's a rather enjoyable ""twist"" to the whole ""demon possession"" routine that marks the entire franchise.The biggest disappointment is something I feared would happen without James Wan at the helm. The once terrifying, suspenseful atmosphere during the effective, creative jumpscare sequences now gives place to the generic build-up that viewers experience in some of the cheapest horror movies of today. Due to a character's health issue, the tension levels are constantly high for this person in particular, but for most of the runtime, the general environment lacks the essential scary feeling. The jumpscares look lazy and too obvious, a cliche that The Conjuring films fought hard to distance themselves from. In addition to this, it's a much darker movie than the rest in terms of lighting.Finally, I have mixed feelings about the ending. Without spoiling it, of course, it's similar to A Quiet Place Part II in the sense that two different sequences need to be edited together seamlessly so the viewers can easily follow what's happening without losing the tension and suspense. One of these scenes is particularly shaky, repetitive, and overly dark, which definitely left me a bit disappointed. Peter Gvozdas and Christian Wagner's editing is really good, though. Michael Burgess' cinematography offers a couple of gorgeous shots, and Joseph Bishara's score maintains the ominous tone of the franchise. James Wan is clearly missed, but Michael Chaves didn't do a bad job.The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is undoubtedly the weakest installment of the trilogy, but it's still quite far from the awful level of the worst films of the horror franchise. Boasting the trademark terrific production value of the saga, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga deliver outstanding lead performances as the only two emotionally compelling characters. Overall, every element is lesser than the previous The Conjuring movies. From the less scary atmosphere to the unimaginative, generic jumpscares, Michael Chaves isn't able to replicate James Wan's tremendous levels of suspense and tension, despite a brilliant opening sequence. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay focuses on many storylines indirectly connected to the main plot, ending up with a not-that-interesting narrative that doesn't quite justify the main title. Some technical attributes, mainly the editing and cinematography, as well as sound design, compensate with some entertainment. In the end, I still recommend it to fans of the cinematic universe and lovers of the horror genre.Rating: B-",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

73,SoumikBanerjee25,James Wan should come back behind the wheels!,6,12 June 2021,"The first two films of this franchise have been on my top favorite list since the day they got released! What about The Conjuring Universe as a whole? You may wonder; Well, that's up for another discussion. Now coming back to this newest expansion, I certainly had greater expectations. And where does that leave me? In a state of utter Disappointment.""Your Honor, my client pleads not guilty, by reason of demonic possession""Nevertheless, I would still consider it as one of those breezy entertainers with conventional tropes of the Horror we all adore. However, being an avid admirer of two erstwhile editions, I couldn't help but admit; this is indeed the weakest part thus far.Writing here is cluttered with untidy transitions (from one subplot to another) and moreover lacks in the aspect of cohesion. Whilst the technical side of things was pretty darn good, especially the Cinematography (which does offer a number of terrific moments that deserve to be highlighted); it's the script's failure to comply that has complicated the whole situation!For once, the story focused more on the 'Warrens' and less on the victims (Owing to fan service? Most likely). On one hand, we do get a lot from Vera Farmiga & Patrick Wilson; who by the way are absolutely amazing in their respective roles and I genuinely have no complaints about them being the centerpiece. But on the other hand, the main characters pertaining to the core narrative do face inexorable ignorance and unfavorably cast-off to the sidelines!Their dramatic shift from Supernatural entities to Witchcraft & Satanism is kinda baffling. Does it make a huge difference? Not quite. As it does deliver on the horror front. But again from my point of view, they took a drastic decision by coming out of their comfort zone and venturing into a vastly different territory altogether!And I'm not so sure what to feel about that!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

75,RussHog,The Devil Put Me To Sleep,1,7 June 2021,This movie sucks. It's got stupid writing and bad acting. The supernatural stuff isn't very scary. It's a run of the mill stupid movie that features the idiots from the Conjuring franchise. The first one fo those movies was pretty good but all the doll spinoffs and evil nun spin offs and now this nonsense. It's all just rubbish and should be shelved forever.,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
76,raybennetthays,An all-right third installment,6,5 June 2021,"I am one of the biggest Conjuring fans in the universe, I love and I mean LOVE the first two, they're fantastic, the scares are amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the characters are all I lot of fun, (keep in mind I'm still talking about the first two), did I love this one as much as the first two or as much as I expected to? No I didn't, it was just an all right installment to this franchise.As always, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga give some seriously fantastic performances, they're one of the biggest reasons I like these films, and it's a great dilemma to have Patrick Wilson's character Ed Warren have a heart attack, because it's gives great stakes to the narrative.Michael Chaves last made The Curse of La Llorona, which sucked, but his direction is a lot better in this film, and the cinematography is excellent, and Michael gave us some sequences that are shot and directed very well, especially one in a morgue.But the screenplay feels undercooked, the story barely makes any sense, things happen that don't make sense, I don't get the connection between Lorraine and this entity, and it goes from a murder to a curse in a split second, and the switch doesn't make much sense.For the actual Conjuring films, they need to bring back James Wan in the directors chair, I love the guy, he's a master behind the camera, he's so talented and his scares are executed so nicely, and they are not false in the slightest bit, he needs to come back.But there was a very good performance from supporting actor John Noble, who plays the traditional horror movie expert that's in a lot of horror films, they tell you things you need to know after weird things happen, he gives a very good performance.I also loved the references to other horror films, like the one to the exorcist, the one to Annabelle Comes Home, and the one to the original, the one to Annabelle Comes Home was Palmeri funeral home, in Annabelle Comes Home a character was named Bob Palmeri, and to the original, they reference the Perron family, the family from the first one.I also loved the little bits of humor sprinkled into the script, my favorites were: ""Did you meet Elvis before or after he died?"" And Lorraine says before and after, and the other one I loved was when Ed broke the window with the cane, it was pretty funny.Unfortunately, when it comes to the most important aspect, the scares, this film is seriously lacking, and the film could've shaved off 10 or 15 minutes.6/10 or C+, I do think it could've been better.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

But if you look at The Conjuring 3 as a horror/thriller one, I should say it will definitely fail you because not only the movie is not scary, also it's full of boring plots and regular cliche sciences.The Conjuring 3 hasn't discipline to introduce it's character to the audience therefore we couldn't create a connection between them and each other for example the show never revealed the background history of that lady so it couldn't generate terror and fear inside us.In my opinion the absence of James wan as the director or writer is the only reason that Conjuring 3 didn't fulfill our expectations.But it has some advantages after all, like a new storyline and a entertaining mystery for Ed and Lorraine to solve.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
78,apryla-58795,Aren't these movies supposed to be scary?,5,15 June 2021,"I seriously want to know if any of the people involved with these movies really think they are scary or feel that the audience will be scared upon viewing them.I'm a huge horror fan and I've seen all of the Annabelle's, The Conjuring's, The Nun, The Insidious movies etc...and I was laughing, rolling my eyes and yelling stuff out like ""Oh c'mon seriously?! Stop it with this ridiculousness already!"" at each one of them.Look I didn't rate this a one because even though this is bad there are a lot worse horror films out there and I usually reserve ones for those or those terrible Christmas romance movies.Vera Farmiga is a good actress and very watchable. She is captivating when she's on screen so the movie should get points just for her deigning to act in this drivel. I can't understand why she keeps signing on with this franchise...they must be backing up dump trucks full of money to her house because I can't believe she really thinks this material is worthy of her talent.Patrick Wilson is in the dictionary...under the word ""Milquetoast"" and also under the word ""Vanilla"" as well as the word ""Bland"". He looks like someone carved him out of stone (must be employing the use of Botox to fill effect - get it?) because he is so smooth and shiny. The guy is so unremarkable in the roles he's in he might as well be a broom with clothes. He's there alright but he adds nothing.The actor who portrayed Arne was just like Patrick Wilson - smooth and shiny but added nothing and in fact was forgettable.The rest of the cast was so unremarkable I've forgotten them already.I think it is so stupid that these movies are misleading by stating that they're based on true stories because the Warrens ""work"" for lack of a better term has been debunked. I think they were shameless money grubbers who were performing a song and dance...in the old days they would be referred to as ""Charlatans"". They preyed on people's weak state of mind and their desperateness to grab on to any reason for an explanation as to why things were happening around them. I think they were despicable people and it's a shame that they exploited all of those families for their gain.There's no such thing as a clairvoyant or anyone who can ""see"" supernatural stuff. If there's anyone who claims to be able to do so they are lying and should be avoided. The people involved in these so called ""true"" stories were mentally ill or physically ill with something that caused their issues. Nothing more nothing less.This movie was actually a little better than the other two because if you looked at it more like a drama than a horror film it wasn't bad but since this is touted as a horror film I can't call this film good nor can I recommend it.If you want to watch something scary-watch the news or listen to true crime. There ARE monsters and evil in the world but they aren't supernatural. Evil comes in the form of a human - like the ""handsome guy next door"" (Ted Bundy anyone?) or a disgruntled ex-employee or an unhinged romantic ex-partner or a child who has been bullied too much etc...there is evil in people and some a little more than others and it's lurking just below the surface of their seemingly normal facade which they display to the world. They could become unhinged at any moment and you will never see it coming...THAT is what should keep people up at night NOT this ridiculousness that they try to give credence to by claiming it's based on a ""true story"". Wish they'd be done with all these franchises and try to come up with something really scary.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

86,baileycrawly,"Tired, Cliche Zombie of a Franchise",2,5 June 2021,"One of the big complaints about this film is that there is far too much of a reliance on story, and it's honestly a fair criticism. While story is an integral part of any story, story details fall short when the character sare not ones the viewer can identify with or have sympathy & empathy toward. This film is just another victim of one of the horror movie franchise killers: some of the best horror franchises have either wound up going to space or slowly developing into a detecitve series. What could very easily have been an interesting change in direction to breathe new life into a franchise that has, for all intents and purposes, been on the rocks with its spinoffs of varying quality. Instead, we got the third entry into the core series, helmed by a different director who doesn't seem to understand the carefully constructed intricacies and details James Wan put into his films. The once memorable Ed and Lorraine Warren are nothing more than cardboard-cutout pawns in this film, there to serve their purpose in furthering the plot, and nothing more. It's heavily apparent that the actors are doing the absolute best they can, but they're working with a script so far removed from what made the franchise successful in the first place that it's a mere shadow of what it once was.Without a connection to the characters, this is an extremely boring and pretentious film. Taking cues from the (equally terrible) David Fincher film Seven, and stealing some direct major plot points from The Exorcist in its opening act, this film is set up to be the next great entry into the franchise, only to let the viewer down with a barely watchable approach to the material. Being the first core film without the involvement of both James Wan and Lorraine Warren, their absence leaves a gaping hole in the franchise that nobody else will ever be able to sufficiently fill.Every bit as bad as The Nun, but at least The Nun wasn't a cheap and cliche detective story. Am I watching a Conjuring movie, or was I dropped in the middle of the Hellraiser or Saw movies where the focus is shifted from horror to detective work? Honestly, I can't tell. I didn't like them, and I don't like this. If this is a one-off thing, it will be forgivable but if this is the direction the franchise is planning to take going forward, this will be the beginning of the end.

87,sweidman-28016,Pretty Average,5,18 June 2021,"""Being brave doesn't mean you're not scared. It means you are scared but you hang in there.""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It reveals a chilling story of terror, murder and unknown evil that shocked even experienced real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. One of the most sensational cases from their files, it starts with a fight for the soul of a young boy, then takes them beyond anything they'd ever seen before, to mark the first time in U. S. history that a murder suspect would claim demonic possession as a defense. The Conjuring universe has been milked for a while now. We have the main trilogy, the Annabelle trilogy, The Nun, and the random addition of The Curse of La Llorona. Only three of them have I taken a likening to, those being The Conjuring 1 & 2 and Annabelle: Creation. The rest have been subpar to just plainly bad. The Devil Made Me Do It is an interesting case that should've made for an interesting or entertaining watch at least. The opening for the movie is one of the most ambitious scenes from the whole franchise. And the first act isn't half bad. After the 30-minute mark, all form of originality disappears and we're given a movie we've basically seen before.James Wan is a master of horror. Saw, Insidious, and the first two have proven that fact. It's a shame that this third installment didn't have his name attached to the directing chair. Michael Chaves directed- arguable the worst of them all- and I'm not sure why he returned for this. I guess he knows the formula to follow. But it doesn't work here. There's clear copy and paste techniques that Wan used for the first two. Though not entirely Chaves' fault, but by now we know what is to come. Most of the scares are predictable. The story isn't as strong as it could be. The case part interested me, but everything seemed to pull away from it. Making a story to go with the explanation is the main focus. It's like two separate movies put into one. If one thing works, it's the talent behind it. As always, the acting is good. John Noble has a featured role that I liked. He's good in everything, really, and he added to this for sure. I may be slightly clouded by my feelings towards the franchise. I think it's time for it to reach its end, but maybe something good will come from it soon. The Devil Made Me Do It is pretty average.

The Warrens do, once again, a fantastic job and I loved some references to The Shining or A Nightmare on Elm Street.Personally, I still think the 2nd is the best Conjuring by a large margin (scarier, frenetic, fantastic direction, editing, atmosphere, London). The first one isn't as scary as the second, but it's really well executed with a very strong plot.

96,Mike_Devine,The Warren files still pack a punch,6,13 June 2021,"By now, we're used to the 'Conjuring' cinematic universe and James Wan's interpretation of the files of Ed and Lorraine Warren. It's tricky to continue to tell differentiated versions of similar stories and still make it feel fresh. In 'The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It,' we get a different kind of story in the Warrens' consultation during a horrific murder case.Like all successful films from the 'Conjuring' saga, 'Devil' has a complex story that Ed and Lorraine must unravel in order to exonerate a young man possessed by a demon (Ruairi O'Connor). Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are back in action, and watching them step into these paranormal detective roles never gets old. Sure, there are some ""been there, done that"" moments in here with some of the scares, which is natural for an entry this deep into a series (including offshoots like the 'Annabelle' series and 'The Nun'). But Wan and team demonstrate that there are still a few tricks up their sleeves to keep things from becoming too stale.It isn't the high note, but 'The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It' is worth a watch for any fan of this genre and, more specifically, the Warrens.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

99,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,1,9 June 2021,"Good Morrow, countrymen.Do literally anything else with your time...plow a field, eat a carrot, stare at an old tree. Anything.A 1 is probably a bit harsh, but this installment annoyed me.Moody clairvoyant Lorraine Warren and her frilly 70's era blouses once again channels the supernatural to a final showdown in a dimly lit house. The third installment wasn't supposed to be a ""haunted house"" story, but still managed, at the end, to be a Haunted House story in exactly the same way that Bathsheba (Conj 1) and Valak (Conj 2) used their respective houses...so does The Occultist (and her buddy Satan), in this. C'mon!All the usual stuff is here, and that's good and bad - I suppose. At the beginning, a small kid is possessed by ""The Devil,"" and during his exorcism we see his body horribly bent in life-ending positions. Thankfully, his big sister's suitor does the right thing and invites the spirit to take him instead. Impressive move. Spirt takes him up on the offer and the kid is now free and in perfect health. No injuries at all - not one broken bone or bruise. I'm fine with the cool visual (I guess this scene was done by a professional contortionist), but it doesn't add any credibility or darkness to the story. It's just a cheap effect.Later on, the teen suitor goes through the whole contortionist thing himself; bones creaking, unnaturally bent and all around awkward. It's now a lazy trope and that's all this movie offers up...rehashed images from the prior Conjuring's and a host of similar supernatural thrillers.The one truly unique element of this popcorn horror was the creepy female Occultist. I found her interesting, and there is a particular scene when Lorraine is deep in her trance confronts her...the surprised Satanist asks Lorraine ""how she's doing it."" Nifty scene...of course, not long after.The Occultist is mangled into a contorted mess.This movie has to compete with the two prior installments, and as such is definitely, the weakest. For me, the franchise is stale. James Wan's first two (especially #1) are outstanding.If you're a true genre fan, you'll be moderately entertained, but that's about it. It's Hollywood horror - no innovation...just budget and noise.If you're a casual PG-13 horror fan (this is an R, but still plays like its little brother), you'll probably dig it.Fare thee well, it's hoecakes and Madeira time.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

101,fciocca,"Some good ideas here and there, but overall pretty disappointing. No tension and no real scary moments",5,29 June 2021,"When I discovered that Michael Chaves directed this third installment of the Conjuring franchise, I was extremely perplexed. I mean, we are talking about the guy that made ""The Curse of la Llorona"", which was an awful horror, for sure the worst of this expanded narrative universe.Let's start with the positive aspects of ""The Evil Made Me Do It"". There are in fact here and there some good ideas, such as the scene of Lorraine in the forest. I really liked how it was directed and I could feel so much tension. The script is overall decent, and manages to keep you entertained until the very end. There are however some elements of the story that are not believable at all, especially towards the end. As always Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga delivered a good performance and honestly I cannot see any other actor at their place. They are simply perfect for the job. Also, the rest of the cast was not bad, but I have to say that the general acting quality lowered a little bit, compared to the two previous flicks.Unfortunately, I think that screenwriters overdid it. Lorraine here seems to have some kind of superpower: she can see everything, how certain events took place, who was involved and this just does not stick for me. Also Ed one moment is in a wheelchair or he needs to use a walking stick, and the next moment he can run and even slam a hammer. Is this a horror or a superhero blockbuster? The movie cannot transmit any kind of suspense, I was never really scared or worried for any of the characters. Clearly the director did not know how to use shots and photography at his advantage, in order to keep the audience on the verge. There are no surprises, no real strange events or nothing that will make you curious about the story. I mean, the movie does its job, which is entertaining for a couple of hours but from a franchise like this one, I was expecting much more.Honestly, this for me is a pass.

102,DeBBss,Tried something different and didn't work so well,6,22 July 2021,"The Conjuring series is known for having really solid horror flicks, but this ain't it. The Conjuring 1 and 2 had greatly paced stories that were intense and scary; whereas The Conjuring 3 has none of those qualities. I found this film to be the least bit scary. The atmosphere, settings, camera work and cinematography were nothing like the first two, and because of that, it doesn't really feel like a Conjuring movie.The story is radically different. It doesn't feature a creepy house with a scary demon; this story is more like a wild goose-chase featuring someone's weird aunt. I don't know why they went in this direction when it clearly worked so well before, maybe it was the director's or screenwriters' choice, but it certainly wasn't a good one.As I've already mentioned, the film isn't really that intense or scary. I found myself just casually watching the movie, not white knuckling or anticipating something scary. This is the least scary movie of the franchise, which is unfortunate because this franchise is known for being absolutely terrifying.This film does get some things right, but its lack of scares brings down this movie. If they do make another one, then they better go back to its old roots. They tried something different and it didn't work, time to go back to James Wan and hopefully give it another try.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Overall rating 76/100The conjuring 3: the devil made me do it is a chilling story of murder and an unknown evil that shocked even experienced real life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. One of the most sensational cases from their files, it starts with a fight for the soul of a young boy, then takes them beyond anything they'd ever seen before, to mark the first time in US history that a murder suspect would claim demonic possession as a defense.The conjuring 3 was pretty good, but for me was by far the weakest of the conjuring films. The opening was very intense and extremely well done. I thought they built tension well, with some effective jumpscares. The cinematography and set pieces were excellent and as creative as previous entries in parts. I liked the added stakes in the film, and the stakes for Ed and Lorraine Warren and their relationship. I liked the character background. I though the performances from the whole cast were excellent, especially from Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga who are still on top form here, and their chemistry and connection really held this film together. There was some likeable characters, and the setting up of the different relationships was done well. I liked the new elements they added to the franchise and the wider scope than just being limited to a haunted house. I loved the usage of Lorraine's powers. The mystery and the set up of that was excellent and interesting. The sound design was excellent, I also liked the development to the plot, the plot twists and the final act was intense.But for me the film had a fair amount of pacing inconsistencies, it was slightly all over the place and didn't keep its tension throughout like previous instalments. I thought that there was a far amount of plot holes. The movie was missing the family dynamic that the previous films did so well. And for me the movie was just less scary and less polished as the previous films, mostly due to the change in director.So overall, the conjuring 3 is still a solid horror. With enough intensity and thrills to keep fans satisfied, and Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are still on top form, making the film mostly work. But it lacked the scares and intensity of previous instalments, therefore its impact was smaller, and was missing too many elements that made the previous two films work so well and be so successful.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

109,movieman6-413-929510,"Michael Chaves still lacks his own creativity for horror films, because here he copies more of the classics.",5,11 June 2021,"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is the third Conjuring film and the eighth film in the Conjuring film universe. The film is directed by Michael Chaves, the director of the Conjuring spin-off film The Curse of la Llorona.In the film, Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) have just managed to save young David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard) from a demon. What they don't know is that the demon has jumped over to David's sister's friend Arne (Ruairi O'Connor). The occupied Arne thus commits a murder, for which he ends up in court. The Warrens must now come up with enough evidence to convince the court that Arne is innocent and that a demon is responsible for his actions. If they fail to do this, Arne unjustly ends up in prison.This Conjuring movie is again based on a real story, the one where for the first time in history someone blamed a devilish demon for his dark crimes.James Wan, the director of the first two Conjuring films, retires from this film as a writer and producer, which unfortunately is reflected in the lower quality of the film. Together with James Wan, director Michael Chaves has also decided not to let this third Conjuring film be about an exorcism situation in a house. The film largely loses its horror aspect and turns more into a detective thriller where the Warrens look for evidence to prove Arne's innocence. With this change, this film loses the tension and pace of the first two Conjuring films.Michael Chaves has grown as a horror director since directing La Llorona, but in this film he still makes a lot of use of often predictable jump scares and other horror elements seem a bit copied. For example, there are horror scenes that resemble scenes from A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Exorcist and The Shining. Despite trying to sell these scenes as a tribute to the horror movies it was copied from, these scenes come across as simple, predictable copies. This makes you more likely to think back to these films. You also get more sense to watch these classic horror films instead of watching this film. James W manages to bring out more creative horror elements with his horror film. This creativity still belongs to Michael Chaves.The acting is fortunately well done by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. In this film, Patrick Wilson's character gets a heart attack, forcing them both to play their characters in a slightly different way. In addition to their delivery, John Nobel, another paranormal investigator, and Julian Hilliard also provide good acting in the film. Ruairi O'Connor and Sarah Catherine Hook also provide good acting, but are more overshadowed by the rest of the cast.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Its like they take on a Scooby Doo style detective case looking for clues to break a curse. The special effects are terrific as always.

The movie started off good with a thrilling horror scene and from then I was intrigued with the plot till the end. Although I did like the plot, I thought some parts of it was a little bit cliched at times like the ending, and this is probably why critics and other people have given the movie negative reviews. There where a few horror scenes in the movie which I thought where decent, but they didn't scare me or made me jump a bit like in the first movie.

113,Darkjak007,A Shadow of a Doubt,6,5 June 2021,"The Conjuring: The Devil made me do it is based off the off the famous Arne Johnson case where The first time after being tried for the murder of a man claims demonic possession as the cause of his action. Patrick Wilson& Vera Fermiga once again reprises Their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren as they travel in search of evidence to save Arne from the death penalty. As always just because it says based off a true story does that mean the movie is meant to be taken as seriously but it doesn't mean that It can't be enjoyed. However of the three films this one is the weakest. It tries to offer something different where your not given another haunted House case. The movie is more of a Supernatural Crime triller. Having the Warrens earn their title as Paranormal Investigators traveling to Massachusetts to various location, finding strange items and find the Source. A mystery that more then just a demon is involved with mention of the Ram cult. It a welcome change of pace, where the movie loses itself is it not as scary or misleading, many of the scare are very predictable with shots hold way to long. You can spot them a mile away. The lack of atmosphere also hails from the fact James Wan didn't directed this film. Instead the direction was given to Michael Chaves who did the curse of La Llorona. This film's better then La Llorona but it can't be help the obvious change of pacing and tone. It also suffers from its characters with the exception of John noble as the occult expert, you don't really care about anyone else but the Warrens. Arne while not Terrible doesn't really become relevant until halfway through the movie apart from cutting back to him. Ed and Lorraine don't suffer from this that much there is a subplot involving Ed's heart, and does add tension because that's where the film still does good. You care about these two despite pros and cons of these films they're still the main factor that holds the film together. While music is still done pretty well and the Final act is good while though arguably way too many of the scenes take place during the day, overall the movie feels restricted by the Subject matter, it still tries to convey a fresh idea and is overall still a entertainment experience.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
114,zac-04879,Surprisingly Disappointing,5,4 June 2021,"Compared to the previous films, The Devil Made Me Do It is a great-looking but surprisingly disappointing section of The Conjuring story. With James Wan no longer directing the story, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga still present the essential performances followed by casual jump-scares. The Conjuring 3 is quite unalike the first film and focuses on the tension towards jump-scares, which is definitely dissatisfying for horror fans.So what else is unfortunate about The Devil Made Me Do It? The tension and acting holds us through, but the entertainingly attractive story turned out to be really slow-moving. The momentum of the film completely takes over and ruins the epic supernatural action.Basically The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is a big disappointment, despite the terrific acting and striking story. The film's tension is absolutely loveable, but just isn't the same as the tear-jerking terror of the past stories. There are always the fans who will enjoy the movie as it's definitely interesting being based on a true story, but The Devil Made Me Do It is unlikable, unappealing and uncharged.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

119,FelipeCarrillo,'The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It' Review: A 'Zodiac' Puzzle of a Thriller Where the Warrens' Love Defeats Satanism,7,5 June 2021,"With some exceptional scares and a beautiful love story at his core, James Wan's highest-grossing horror franchise adds a new chapter that requires the theatrical experience in order to be truly appreciate it.Malaysian-born Australian filmmaker James Wan is the certified modern master of horror. He is certainly far from pleasing those craving for ""elevated horror"" and yet, has managed to carve out a filmography as chillingly successful as strikingly diverse inside the Hollywood monster. By delivering two smartly terrifying haunted-house classics, one of the most visually creative haunting sequels, a stripped-down ""torture porn"" gem, the most human, adrenaline-charged 'Fast & Furious' entry and an exquisite ""Lord of the Rings""-""Matrix"" CGI-fest DC mashup, Wan has secured on his own a poste in the annals of modern cinema.Among his several billion-dollar-plus-grossing franchises, 'The Conjuring' has been the pioneering one, opening new ways to both adapt the Warren's real-life case files and explore miscellaneous themes and styles through prequels and spin-offs on either fictional or real characters. Ranging from Corin Hardy's piece of Gothic horror to David F. Sandberg's solid horror joint, 'The Conjuring' universe has manufactured a couple of decent, Hollywood-signed spooky installments. However, it has concocted a firm slate of mediocre, jump-scare-oversaturated entries that opt to stick themselves to worn-out, accustomed grounds.For any fan of Wan's cinematic goldmine, the very first red flag for this third entry came when the ""Dead Silence"" director passed on the torch to Michael Chaves, who debuted as a filmmaker with the insulting slab of Mexican folklore ""The Curse of La Llorona"". As the first images and marketing material started to come up, the concern quickly escalated since, even though most of the main members of the team were back - Farmiga and Wilson as the endlessly charming leads, Johnson-McGoldrick and Wan as screenwriters and Joseph Bishara as composer- they did not catch the heart-stopping, buzz-building promotional level of its predecessors. Additionally, it came along with, firstly, the studio-panicking decision to release it in cinemas on the empty summer spots of an on-going pandemic and, secondly, Warner Bros' breaking news on streaming its entire movie slate simultaneously, a business strategy that strongly hurts the vital communal experience these sort of movies need to success at the box office.Luckily, all those concerns faded away peu à peu as the gorgeous title card- bathed in the usual mustard yellow- started to roll up. With a different, ambitious new direction, New Line Cinema's threequel somehow manages to hit the mark, even if, on its way, some truly promising, one-of-kind new takes are thrown away.Arne Johnson (Ruairi O'Connor, ""The Spanish Princess"") has been possessed by a demonic spirit after a failed exorcism between the Warrens and David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard, ""WandaVision""), the 8-year-old child of a middle-class family moving to its new home in the town of Brookfield, Connecticut. A few days later, under the influence of this inhuman power, he murders his landlord, is arrested for first-degree murder but pleaded ""not guilty"" in court. Now he must convince the jury that, in fact, the devil made him do it.Inspired on the widely-known very first case in the US where demonic possession was used as defense in a court case, the latest installment suggested it would raise the bar higher than it should, endangering some elements that have allowed its same-bloodline predecessors to work so perfectly, especially horror-wise. Have no doubt: as a threequel, it needs to expand itself and wide its scope, reaching new settings to grow and develop in a different way. By trying its best to both honor the horror legacy and explore such an important event in American history, it triumphs just in one of those fields.Several points have made the original 'The Conjuring' movies stand out from the unholy amount of studio horror productions. Most of them relies on the cinematic, but the primary factor corresponds to the storytelling focal concept: the Warren's love, always accompanied by the suffering of a helpless family. Everything takes shape from that point, as the films firstly introduce its characters and basics, making us care about them so the horror component is able to build up itself swiftly. With the Perrons in Rhode Island, the naïve girls, the hard-working father and the caring mother, Wan saved the heart of the audience in his pocket, just like he did with the Hodgsons in the UK for the sequel, with the four kids and the single mother. This time, there are no main family to care about. We surely follow Arnie and his girlfriend, peppered with some occasional appearances and flashbacks of Daniel, but, in fact, we are following Ed and Lorrain's battle, with Ed coping with his heart problems and Lorrain trying to solve the case before it is too late. Their relationship has become the driving force of it all and, even though light symptoms of fatigue are silently springing up, it still works beautifully.Supported by some fully committed supporting performances -, a terrific Ruairi O'Connor and a touching John Noble as standouts, - the emotional core is firmly hold by the human chemistry between Farmiga and Wilson. Both actors showcases their chops with so much honesty and heart that, even if we all know they are not going to die- not for now, at least - we believed they are in danger and anything could happen to them. Owning it as their franchise, these two hugely talented actors have established these characters as one of the most prominent couples of modern cinema.With a promising yet convoluted script, top-notch performances and some storytelling tricks, the only ingredient remaining is, actually, the actual hook for mainstream audiences: the horror aspect. Some of the reasons why the panic was so big after the announcement of Chaves as director were not just related to his storytelling command, but as well to his overreliance on jump-scares. ""The Curse of La Llorona"" outrageously hinged on that side too much, making lose importance to some quite suspenseful set-pieces. In fact, craftsmanship is one of the things that Wan does so well in his movies, a vehicle used to ratchet up the tension through anticipation, atmosphere and wise camera moves, toying with empty spaces and reading the audience's expectations.Such a relief to know most of the sequences here are deftly craft, with two or three ranking among the best in the universe. Take for instance the masterful prelude-with a quite literal ""Exorcist"" nod-, which, just like the Amityville or the Annabelle past preludes, is a smartly-edited high-tension delight. Chaves, cinematographer Michael Burgess and composer Joseph Bishara orchestrates some remarkable sequences where, even if an imminent jump-scare arrives at the end, the tension is palpable and the visual and sound techniques- the indulgent sound design could end up annoying some-are wisely employed, highlighting the mortuary sequence, Lorrain's psychic crime-scene reenactment, Bruno's murder and the claustrophobic climax.""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" by Michael Chaves is a surprisingly welcome addition to the original 'Conjuring' franchise, proposing through its Satanism and mystery-solving storytelling approaches new shapes and horror textures to explore, always respecting Wan's legacy and even honoring it with gleefully scary sequences, excellent performances, inventive mise-en-scène and a strong love-story core support. At the end, it still comes out as the least terrifying and most flawed of the three original movies, but when you have Wan as your predecessor, not much can be done.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Thus, the alien civilization which is due to descend needs to think far, far, far outside the botox.The sprinkle, of the alien mothership, seen from the eyes of the two young adults; it needs to build an all-new I to I, so that neither falls for the other (L).",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
121,ajkbiotech,A nice story driven film based on true but bizarre events,10,6 June 2021,"This third in the series also stars the indefatigable Vera Farmiga, who works a ton but always delivers potent performances, and the vastly underrated Patrick Wilson, who is terrific in this role.The script keeps it 100 here as it faithfully follows the facts of a bizarre case of an exorcism gone somewhat wrong in the early 1980s. The exorcism goes technically correct, but the spirit, instead of being dissipated, instead takes up residence in another person present at the ritual.From there it becomes a several year mystery as to what's really going on, and without giving away spoilers, it's not a routine exorcism at all but something darker, deeper and devilishly clever.The film 🎥 is scary, terrifying and will have you on the edge of your seat.Definitely watch it!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

123,mattiasflgrtll6,The only sore spot in the trilogy,5,8 June 2021,"Ed and Lorraine are dealing with the demonic possession of a young boy named David. They fight with tooth and nail to get the demon out and succeed, but their troubles only worsen once it takes over Arne's body instead...The biggest problem with the movie starts in the very opening scene. The openings for the first two Conjurings are really creepy and makes you at unease for what kind of horrors will come next. But here it feels like the same kind of exorcism scene everyone seems to do ever since The Exorcist came out. Except instead of harrowing and unsettling it's over-the-top in the cheesiest possible way.And that's the kind of ""scares"" you will get through the whole thing. Not only were the jumpscares far too many, but so easily telegraphed as well. Every false moment of relief you can tell will be interrupted by someone popping up when they turn around or someone grabs them with their rusty claws. I'm not against all forms of jumpscares (I know very well James Wan used them as well), but there has to be some kind of tension, a chilling atmosphere that make the jumpscares when they do actually happen pay off. It's a sign of laziness the director can't let the audience get a little nervous before they drop the big monster on them. Speaking of the monsters as well, how come that every bad horror movie has really fake-looking digital effects? You're too distracted by how ridiculous it looks to get any kind of reaction out of them. Crooked Man and The Nun both felt real and really got under your skin. The Occultist was a decent villain, and Eugenie Bondurant does a good enough job at making her threatening, but even she is still a victim of occasional poor CGI work.But what about the story? Does it make up for the lack of scares? There is potential with a case where someone claims to be controlled by the devil after committing a murder, and whether or not you can make it hold up as a legal defense. The legal aspect is so irrelevant to the plot at hand however that the movie doesn't remember to bring it up again until the ending. Instead we're dealing with a mystery where the connections are too loose to be interesting. The weirdest plot twist has to be when they build up Kastner (a former priest) to possibly be connected to a Satanic cult, and then it turns out he's just the stepfather of the woman who turned into a demonic creature. So what was the point of all the scenes between him and the Warrens? Just pure exposition?There are still a few positives. Ed and Lorraine save this movie from reaching the bottom, and it's largely due to Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. You love seeing them as these characters, and even though the whole backstory of them falling in love is underexplained (Are they implying their love was forbidden or something?), their chemistry is very believable and makes for some of the few suspenseful moments in the film. When Lorraine has to cover in fear as a possessed Ed tries to strike her repeatedly with a hammer you really feel bad for her since she has to run for her life from someone she loves.Ruari O'Connor and Sarah Catherine Hook, even though their characters are not all that interesting (Before Arne gets possessed by the devil we don't know much about him at all other than him thinking about proposing to his girlfriend) both do a good job. Julian Hillard is also solid as David, the boy whose waterbed was probably bought at IKEA.The ending is okay, I guess. A moment of sweetness between Ed and Lorraine. But the real highlight is the credits, where we get to hear an audio tape of the case this movie is based on. Even though I'm not a believer of the occult or anything, that's the only part I actually found creepy, if not for the sounds alone.I should've known I was in for a letdown when James Wan jumped ship, but I was hoping the change in director wouldn't affect the movie's quality too much, and the tone would generally still be in the spirit of the first two Conjurings.Instead, this is just another modern horror film without much style or class.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

127,PCC0921,A Change in Direction Still Keeps the Train Rolling,7,13 June 2021,"Released: June 4th, 2021
Viewed: June 11th, 2021In the case of the Conjuring films (2013-2016), all of them have been reasonably good. There might be a couple moments of drag, in the pace of the first two films, maybe a miscue or two with the acting, but very minor stuff. They are not knock-down, great, but they are polished, classic, Hollywood inspired, pieces of work, that get the job done in the modern day of film-making. Director James Wan and crew did accomplish what they wanted to in the first two films. So, in this third one, Director Michael Chaves has to take on the dreaded third film (the one that always plagues franchises, the dreaded third film), try to be as fresh as possible and to tell audiences that this train still has a lot of story to tell. They almost get to the measuring stick, set by the first two films, but fall a hair short. What I mean by that is, they still keep the train going with minor imperfections. It is not as bad as it sounds, because the film does have a lot to offer towards the franchise as a whole.First off, what makes this one shine, in parts, is what made the first two films as good as they were. That would be the chemistry and professional accuracy of the two main characters. The Mr. & Mrs. Smith of the demon hunters movie club. Ed and Lorraine Warren, played brilliantly by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. Yes, I think they were born for these roles. They totally capture the essence of what their characters are all about. They also do emanate their characters' feelings for each other and it comes off the screen to you. You believe the relationship.What also made this film interesting to watch, was the slight change of gears they made in Chaves' attempt to keep things fresh. As you know from the first two movies, the Warrens answer the calls from people, who are being terrorized by evil spirits in their homes. The spirits have become demons, due to some kind of issue with limbo or something and they try to possess someone in the world of the living. The Warrens come in to exorcise the demon from the person possessed. The staple in the plots though for the first two films was the idea that the threat was coming from a being of paranormal design. A being that isn't actually a being, not tangible really, but a person already dead and gone, just stuck. That brings us to that change that Chaves and the writers infused into this film's script.What they decide to do is introduce the idea of the Occultist and the concept of being cursed by someone, which is still just as effective and chilling as the first two movies. Being possessed by a demon looked just as ugly as being cursed. It also adds a more tangible, more believable monster, because it is actually inhabiting the real world. It felt different knowing that Ed and Lorraine were in danger with the paranormal, as well as, the normal.This film also tackles the idea of how the real world reacts to this kind of world. Ed and Lorraine are real people, doing a job, most people don't think is a thing. So, if something legal pops up they are scrutinized to the end. This is evident when they go to help a detective with a murder case and of course, he is tough to convince, that they are genuine. The film also shows us another plot arc of what happens if these concepts come up in a court of law. Ed and Lorraine also have to race against time to bring in evidence to prove that their client committed murder by reason of demonic possession. It is based off of their real world experience of being at the first ever court case that involved using demonic possession as a defense.It is the surrounding cast of characters that hurt the film slightly though. With all that is going on in this film (and there is a lot), dealing with the other characters may have been too much and they seemed to lack some depth. A lot of them seemed to pop in and out just to move things along. They were more like a tour guide than a person you should care about in this story. But, that is it. The film is still a nice addition to the trilogy. This film also spends a lot less time inside the house and actually takes us to different settings other than the haunted house set pieces. Relax, there still is some house in this one.7.5 (C+ MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
128,jp281995,It's quite good,7,2 November 2021,"Set in the early 1980s, this film tells the story of a man who murdered a landlord, and then he claims that...yes, as the title says...the devil made him do it.Performance of the actors is great, especially by Wilson and Farmiga as always. Setting, costume and production design are also well-done. Love how they make it look as authentically 80s as possible.The whole film in general, however, is lackluster compared to the previous two films. The story lacks tension, and didn't really scare me. Most jump scares weren't effective as well, and much of the story is quite predictable.

This is especially put into grave effect during the ending sequence, which includes real-life photographs, footage, and recordings. The movie itself is paced well despite some drawn out scenes, and while I was never genuinely scared, it did have a palpably creepy atmosphere throughout, complemented by great cinematography and effects. The latter of which never felt over-the-top, although there were a few scenes that benefited from an illogical cliché of poorly lit rooms. That can be forgiven in a horror movie, though. Some wholesome elements may be perceived as cheesy but I felt they were a nice touch and a reminder that, even through all of the theatrics, Ed and Lorraine Warren were real people.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

134,arabnikita,Mediocre and boring to the point that I couldn't wait for the movie to end,5,5 June 2021,"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021)In the five years following the excellent Conjuring 2, this horror universe has expanded by introducing lackluster projects like The Nun and Curse of La Llorona. I hoped that Conjuring 3 will finally break the curse and bring us an interesting narrative with quality scares but instead, we got more mediocrity. The plot, dialogue, ending and the scares themselves were so weak to the point that instead of being engaged or feeling afraid, I was simply waiting for the movie to end.The demonic possession subgenre has been depicted in all kinds of ways and I thought that if any movie could come up with something exciting, it would be Conjuring 3. What we got instead, was borderline Harry Potter but with dimmed lighting. Half the movie is straight up magic with people and things appearing and disappearing which takes away from the suspense, not to mention ruins the scares.The effects were pretty nice and the initial possession was well made but the longer the film went on, the more fatigue I felt due to cringe dialogue and lethargic plot. Hearing real footage and seeing actual photos at the end did leave a certain impact considering it is based on historical accounts. With that being said, horror movies have got to stop having fairy tale endings. In order to have an impact, there shouldn't be happiness; otherwise, how do they expect us to feel genuine terror at the end?

147,theredsky,The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It Review,4,6 June 2021,"I really like The Conjuring 1 and 2. Both are some of my favorite horror films and that is mostly because of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, and Director James Wan. While the film still has the two actors, James Wan isn't Directing this one and it's noticeable. It feels like a rip off of James Wan style which sucks because he made the first 2 movies so interesting while this one falls into the worst trap a horror movie can fall into; being boring. While the opening feels like something James Wan would do and it's the best part of the movie, the rest of the film fails miserably to match that energy. While 1 and 2 had some issues, the uniqueness of it and the scares always kept you engaged but in this one, Ed and Lorraine are the ONLY interesting things about this movie. The story falls into a stereotypical horror film with every story beat being predictable and while yes the first 2 films were predictable, it was getting to that end that made you invested but this time you know everything that is going to happen. The first two films benefited from having supernatural elements while this one is just a witch lady who isn't dead. I really don't understand why they did this. She isn't possessed by anything. She just kinda walks around and manipulates people. There were some things I liked about the film though. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga still do a good job with the material and John Noble was pretty great as well. Some of the cinematography looks nice and there is a great shot at the beginning that takes inspiration from The Exorcist. That's about it. There really wasn't a whole lot I liked. It was just a very bland, very forgettable, and unscary addition to this flailing universe.

This is the first one of these flicks that made me feel a little weird about it being based on a true story. The movie introduces the main cast right in the middle of an exorcism and never lets go of the pace from there.

The corny love between the warrens and arnie and his ANNOYING GIRLFRIEND! Wow! I had to keep skipping those parts. Then the end came and she was like ""i love you."" 🤢 that girl was so annoying. She kept telling people to stop reciting the bible during the exorcisms. Just annoying. This movie didnt show much of Judy. She was cute! Where was she? Some of the REACTIONS to things like the totem at warren house, the debbie girl screams before even looking at what was in the vase! Wow! Some of the acting was rushed. I can see why others said James wan should've directed. I agree. Well, at least somebody other than who directed this. Anyway, Had to change the rating. Love doesnt kill demons. Lol. Wow! I still like this but the love stuff is so annoying to watch. Were the warrens really that way or are they over exaggerating to hook in the female viewers and couples? Seems like a marketing tactic. Im single. I dont want to see that and it was sad that debbie survived. Lol shouldve been her, not bruno. All bruno wanted was to drink beer and dance! Lol.This is the best way to watch a scary movie to determine if it's good or not! All these negative reviews saying it's not scary, i doubt many of them watched alone. Pay attention to every detail, watch alone, preferably at night. If you walk into your dark bathroom(i sometimes dont turn on light if im just peeing. I pee in my bathtub, lol. I just walk in the dark bathroom, walk to bathtub/shower and let loose! I even pee on the wall! Lol. My neighbors can hear it every time. It's loud! Lol). So, light off in the bathroom, i walk in to pee and wash my hands. I get creeped out at the darkness and silence. The movie was great! Very fascinating Witch lady! And voodoo concept.I honestly would like to know more about the Old witch lady, if she was human, how she was able to teleport and be magical, and why she picked her victims? The film didnt explain that much. Except for the old creepy priest man who raised her. I honestly thought he was going to help her as he studied the Ram Cult and left the priesthood. I thought they converted him. But no! Just creepy. I thought the witch could've talked a little more creepily, but she was good. The acting was great by everybody. Unlike in that la larrona movie where the main cast(except the dude) couldn't act/react realistically to what was happening to them. The mom and the little girl in that movie ruined it by their casual, bad acting. Whatever! This film was better.I think this film couldve been slightly longer over the 2 hour mark, but it was almost at the perfect length. I was hooked the whole time. Conjuring 1 was good. Conjuring 2 was not great for me and was long. This conjuring was my favorite. The Male lead who gets possessed is a great actor and very lucky but his name is very confusing to spell and say, lol. But he was in The Spanish Princess with Sexy Charlotte Hope who was in The Nun who should've been the FEMALE LEAD IN THE NUN, but she died early, and Vera farmiga's annoyingly bad younger sister was the lead and thus, I fall Asleep Every time i watch the Nun! 30 minutes in The Nun, i fall asleep! Taissa farmiga cant act and is another product of Hollywood nepotism that's ruining films! Stop the nepotism! My cousin is Shonda Rhimes, she could easily put me in her Shondaland show ""Bridgerton"" or greys anatomy but she doesnt. Lol. She should! Lol. Anyway, This movie was great! Not perfect but wow! Very good! I want to watch again, but ill wait until it's night and i have snacks! Lol.Haters gone hate! This was great! But yes, james wan would've been a better director. Still, the direction wasnt bad. I was just wanting to know more about the Witch and the ""WHY"" she chose those specific people to curse. I also want to know that process so i can curse some people, like camel face harris and biden, lol. Jk! Lol. Or am i? Lol. I like this movie! Also, The instrumental Music was so cool! And the songs were cool, too! EDDIE MONEY?! I had no idea his songs were early 1980's or 1970's. He's gone, now. I think cancer! But he also had that ""2 tickets to paradise"" and ""take me home tonight!"" Wow! 3 hits! Nice! Anyway, im hungry!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
157,tresm87,"Without Wan directing it doesn't have that same detail and dynamic, but it does continue the Warren's adventures serviceably with solid story/scares.",7,28 May 2021,"As I said, the film doesn't have the same power and unique feel as Wan's 2, but it is a nice continuation in the franchise with an intriguing story that does delve into the crime drama genre along with giving us the scares we come to know. You can tell Wan still was involved with certain camera works and scare concepts much like he was with the mediocre yet entraining curse of LaLlarona which this director Michael Chaves debuted on. While he doesn't fill Wan's shoes at all, he was able to follow a certain format for this particular franchise to move forward though at dragging pace at times.The actors are all very good as usual and the duo of Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as the Warren's are phenomenal bursting with emotion as always. They carry this film completely. The effects are decently executed and the cgi looks near flawless. Some of the scares are a mixed bag of ambition and some are tremendously cliche, but they all do their jobs for the horror aspect. The ominous settings are fantastic and add rich environment for the frights to flourish.Overall it's an effort that felt satisfying to see the premier franchise continue, but there's a definitive void without Wan's genius eye.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

The over acting in this is at an all time high in this movie.,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
159,stefankrs,James wan..... why,4,22 September 2021,"James Wan really had something going with the conjuring franchise, a very entertaining and interesting set of movies about the supernatural. The first two were amazing and I loved each of them. When I heard that the third movie was coming out I was really excited to see another conjuring movie in the franchise, until I had seen it wasn't directed by James Wan (who left behind the conjuring to make malignant) which gave me thoughts it wasn't going to be the same. It was not. The movie started out alright with the first 30 minutes but just went down after that. The movie just tried too hard to be scary and when something scary happened it was too stupid or expected to have any effect. This movie's story is the weakest and dumbest in my opinion. This movie is a real dissapointment to the conjuring franchise. I just can not believe James Wan left one of the greatest modern horror franchises to direct Malignant. Very dissapointing.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

163,mochteam,Ed and Lorraine Boring,4,9 November 2021,"The first Conjuring film was a horror masterpiece. Everything after it including the spinoff's were terrible. This movies just proves how far the franchise has sunk. It's a hyper fantasy tale of Ed and Lorraine warrens case files. The movie is very Hollywood cliche and nothing new and therefore it's completely predictable and boring... because it follows the same formula as all the Conjuring films. Enough already...horror movies are only good when you add building and suspense and then towards the end reveal the terror. This is basically a slasher flick.It's supposed to be ""paranormal"" as Ed and Lorraine were paranormal investigators but this is just an action slasher movie very loosely based around a real case and by loosely based I mean probably two sentences were taken from the actual story.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
164,matrixdukenukem,A fresh take on Ed Lorraine files,8,6 June 2021,"I am not going to compare two directors. I liked how this one took an investigative approach on this chapter from Ed & Lorraine files. The opening was solid and Michael Chaves is inspired by Exorcist, The Shining, exorcism of Emily Rose, etc and you can find homages scattered throughout. I liked that this time there was a real antagonist and it was a moral versus match.Somewhere in middle the writing loses focus and then picks up in last half n hour. I wish they had taken the court case route to tell the story which would've made this a more effective.We get to know Ed and Lorraine a little bit more and loved the fact that from early on they give Ed a fatal weakness due to which I was always scared for him.Final twist doesn't work but the boss fight is refreshingly amazing. In the end, I liked this movie and I wouldn't show this to my friends for scare factor but a nice thriller with horror elements sprinkled with tension.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
165,cappiethadog,Empirical love,5,8 July 2021,"There is never a priest around when an exorcism needs to be performed. That's the motif which runs through all three films in ""The Conjuring"" series. Ed Warren(Patrick Wilson) fills the void, even though he's just an affiliate of the church. Ed and his wife Lorraine Warren(Vera Farmiga) are paranormal investigators, demonologists who have permission to assist in exorcisms, despite not being official members of the clergy. The tradition continues in ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"", directed by Michael Chavez, taking over for the franchise's helmsman James Wan. The afflicted victim, this time, David Glatzel(Julian Hillard), an eleven-year-old boy, similar to Carolyn Perron(Lili Taylor) and Janet Hodgson(Madison Wolfe) before him, doesn't get to church on time, like a pregnant mother who gives birth without the luxury of an obstetrician and hospital. After the near-fiascos of the last two exorcisms that Ed had to perform on the fly, you would think that Father Gordon(Steve Coulter), the Warrens' liaison, would master the craft himself and nip the devil in the bud. But, alas, no. ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" is not your grandfather's ""Exorcist"", in which Father Karras(Jason Miller), a priest who doesn't specialize in casting out demons, nevertheless, assists Father Merrin(Max Von Sydow), an exorcist who makes house calls. Ed and Lorraine performs yet another exorcism. Father Gordon sits this one out; he's concerned, probably, with the potentiality of a lawsuit should the child die. The Warrens save David, not realizing, however, that the evil spirit jumped bodies. The evil spirit is in Arne Johnson(Ruari O'Connor) now.Bureaucracy is the devil. When presented with video evidence of a self-evident possession, in James Wan's ""The Conjuring"", the Warrens' intermediary has to be coaxed and needled into quick and decisive action. The church official, initially, is unmoved, at the spectacle of some invisible force that causes a young girl to slide violently around her living room. Father Gordon cites Nancy Perron(Hayley McFarland) being unbaptized, and overall, her family's secularism as being problematic. But, to his credit, he makes the call for final approval on the archaic ritual and assignation of an ordained priest to the exorcism site. It's too late, though. Ed gets a call from the girl's father, Roger Perron(Ron Livingston), who returns home from work to his harried family's refuge, a motel, and learns that Carolyn, in essence, kidnapped her their own children: Christine(Joey King) and Andrea(Shanley Caswell). Ed Warren tells the father to meet him at the house; final approval be damned. Ed has a bible and knows how to use it.Agents of the church, still, in James Wan's ""The Conjuring 2"", Father Gordon sends Ed and Lorraine to the UK, just hot off the Amityville case, the same source material for Stuart Rosenberg's ""The Amityville Horror"". It's like watching a film within a film; a sequel within a sequel. Known as the Enfield Poltergeist, the Warrens are utilized as proxies because the church is worried about bad publicity should the claims of Peggy Hodgson(Frances O'Connor) turn out to be an elaborate hoax; an Amityville copycat. A recorded voice heard stateside seemingly belonging to a seventy-two-year-old man should be all the proof the clergy needs to greenlight an exorcism, but the conditions for action involve evidence more baroque, such as objects flying violently around the house or the requisite levitating subject. The soul-saving ritual can't be performed until the last possible moment before the entity asserts its complete governance over the soul. Janet needs to be sufficiently satanic on video. With the cameras rolling, inexplicably, the young girl is caught demolishing the kitchen with nobody's will but her own, proving skeptics like Anita Gregory(Franka Potente) and her ilk right about demonology being a quasi-science, at best. Instead of trusting their instincts, the Warrens leave, telling the bereft mother, Ed does, that ""the church will take one look at that video and that'll be the end of it."" The paranormal investigators choose the politics of their faith over the faith the faith they're supposed to hold unconditionally for the people nobody believes, ostracized little girls like Janet. Lorraine, who went through the same life experiences as Janet, inexplicably bails after the first hint of adversity. To a certain extent, she's brainwashed. ""We're agents of the church,"" Ed explains to Maurice Grosse(Simon McBurney), the Warrens' British analogue. Reluctantly, he shakes Ed's hand, but leaves him with this parting shot: ""Sometimes you need to make a leap of faith. Believe when nobody else will."" Unfortunate for Janet Hodgson, the Warrens are company men.Lankester Merren is targeted, in William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"", because the occupying devil within Regan(Linda Blair), perhaps, recognizes the venerated priest from the archaeological dig in Iraq, and knows that he poses a far greater threat than Damien Karras, a neophyte. The demon, in ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"", bypasses Father Gordon, who ducks his responsibility, suggesting David be brought to the church, despite evidence to the contrary, like, say, a showerhead that explodes blood. Even after David Glatzel goes after his father(Paul Wilson) with a knife, the procrastination persists. Father Gordon is afraid. Ed makes the call in no uncertain terms that the exorcism is going to happen right here, right now. The devil has ears; the devil knows who's in charge. En route to Arne's body, the unholy adversary tries to kill Ed, making good o his promise to stop the paranormal investigator's heart. While Ed performs the exorcism, Lorraine has a vision; an occultist(Eugenie Bondurant) who specializes in heinous arts and crafts, whose decorative totems cause people to die in the same grisly fashion. Bruno Sauls(Ronnie Geve Blevins), Arne's landlord, gets stabbed by his possessed tenant twenty-two times, right in front of Debbie Glatzel(Sarah Catherine Hook), David's sister, engaged to the newly-minted murderer. The occultist made more than one totem. Katie Lincoln(Andrea Andrade), a young college student, is also on the receiving end of twenty-two stabbings, the holder of the knife is her dormmate, possessed likewise. Twenty-two, by all appearances, is the new number of the beast. And then there is Ed Warren himself. The totem tucked away in a flower bouquet was overlooked. He goes after Lorraine with a sledgehammer. Meanwhile, the demon, at long last, faces a church official, Father Newman(Vince Pisani), who is unsuccessful in ridding the intruder from Arne's body at a mental health facility.Ed Warren is a man of god. Ed is good. Crispina(Eileen Walsh), one of the ""fallen women"" in Peter Mullan's ""The Magdalene Sisters"", never encounters real charity during her time at the ""laundries"", which is just a euphemism for asylum. Ed and Lorraine are slow to recognize their own power. The Warrens can pray at home. The bible saves Ed's life in ""The Conjuring 2"", but it's Lorraine's bible; she had written the name of the demon in the good book. She screams: ""Valak(Bonnie Aaron),"" before sending the evil spirit to hell. Ed uses his own bible in ""The Conjuring"". A white light shines down on Carolyn Perron as the mother fights for dominion over her own soul; it's the light of god, but the light is filtered through the prism of Lorraine's heart; it's the light of real love.Ed uses the sledgehammer on the occultist's infernal altar. He saves Arne Johnson's life. Ed Warren is not only a man of god, but a man who loves his wife, an empirical love, and that makes all the difference in the world.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

170,hfreinoso,Enjoyed it but would have been perfect if James Wan returned.,7,11 June 2021,"The Conjuring 3 is directed by Michael Chaves (Yup the guy, who did The Curse of La Llorona) and stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga and sadly it, no longer directed by James Wan, this time Michael Chaves helms the film; this film is an enjoyable but rather unremarkable horror movie. But the fact that he had directed a horror movie before meant that he wasn't wholly inexperienced in the genre. And ""The Devil made me do it"" is indeed a superior movie to La Llorona. But it is still relatively short from the rest of the first two films, and I wish it could have improved. But, again, you could see the difference between James Wan's work versus the work of Michael Chaves. Despite me saying it was way better than La Llorona, I believe we should have gotten someone better than Chaves because this one is by far the weakest of The Conjuring 3 and because of the different writers than the last two films. Despite this, I do like that they went something utterly different from the last two as it would have gotten repetitive, and I am glad they went different from the other two. As well as the actors such as Ruairi O'Connor, Sarah Catherine Hook, and Julian Hilliard all did a great job at their parts. I love the relationship and the arc for both Ed and Lorraine Warren from each other. And how it all started from one another, and how it affects one person to another for their reactions from their issues and their healths from Ed. This film wasn't as terrifying as the first two films, I know they wanted to do something different, and I get that, then they added witchcraft, something different from the last 2.I was still a slight let down by The Conjuring 3. It's important to note that the goal of this movie was to focus on the Warrens and their investigation, which is why it was less scary than the first two and sidetracked. Also, the actual case had nothing; I mean nothing; to do with witchcraft. The Devil made me do it and fabricated this storyline solely to tie the Conjuring universe together. The same cult, Disciples of the Ram, is present in the Annabelle movies. We can most likely plan on seeing more of this cult pop up in future movies. I wish they focused more on the documented case, but there wasn't much more to focus on besides demon possession and exorcism. Hence the creation of this cult arc. That being said, the movie is worth a watch if you enjoy the Conjuring universe and a vital piece. It was a good movie, but I wish they either bring James Wan comeback or hire a perfect director. 7/10.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
171,Alcaminhante,Interesting...but it should have been scary instead.,7,13 August 2021,"Everything is in place for this to be another good Conjuring movie. So...how come this movie is not scary at all ?!! Not scary, totally predictable and with zero suspense through out. In a strange way it's not even a bad movie...it's just not a scary supernatural one.The first two movies have some awesome creepy moments that still work on repeated views but this third one is totally devoid of that. Everything that tries to be scary somehow does not work like that and that's a shame.As usual the characters are great, and it tries to do something different so it does not repeat what was done before but somehow it totally fails as a scary movie.Again, if this was something else the lack of suspense and zero horror creepiness would be enough to kill the movie but in this case because the two,leads are fantastic and captivating as usual the whole thing is very watchable despite being an horror movie which is not scary at all.Therefore if you like the other 2 , watch this as it has its charms but don't expect it to be on the same level as the other 2. If they do another they need to bring the original director creator back for sure.So to me it's a 7 out of 10...maybe a 6.5 actually.Don't expect too much , don't expect to be scared and it's a fun supernatural movie anyway.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
172,trnjamesbond,The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Sleepy,2,7 June 2021,"With this latest edition added to The Conjuring universe, I can say it is a one time watch, and definitely a forgettable film, it really does nothing to progress the franchise in any way, shape, or form. It's seems like it's leaning towards more of a copy and paste from other films of this genre.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise there roles once again as Ed and Lorraine Warren. Aside from this, within the first ten minutes I was shaking my head. We watch a character on screen contorting his body in such a way it becomes comedic, with bone crushing sounds during an exorcism, also showing the audience how to turn a child into a human pretzel. I literally laughed out loud when watching these scenes.The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. Well lets just say, with a tagline like that what did you expect? This film is at least worth one watch, that's it, with an egotistical almost 2 hour runtime, you may find yourself feeling sleepy, in many parts of the film. There is also a blatant, and I'd say, a plagiarist opening scene which depicts the most iconic scene from The Exorcist. In my opinion, this scene really isn't a hats off, or should I say, a nod towards that film. It feels like I said, a blatant ripoff. Many scenes I found were way over the top and unnecessary, to me it seems the writers wrote ridiculous parts to the script to try and scare it's audience, but they come off as campy and very predictable, and fell flat.Now don't get me wrong, the cinematography by Michael Chaves is well done. The main characters did their job at holding this film together, they were all fairly good, but the film uses way too many horror tropes. It creates jump scares that are very predictable, and seems really silly at times. With that being said, this is a silly film. The Exorcism concept has been done to death, there is really nowhere else to go with this sort of story line. In the end, it does tell the story about one of Ed and Lorraine Warrens supernatural cases. But I find it hard to believe.Final verdict. No pun intended. This is a sleepy film, filled with scares that are decades old, and really offer nothing new. In fact this whole franchise is not really that great, after the first entry. I give it 2 out of 10 stars. There is very little horror to this so called horror film. It's kind of sad that the end credits were more intriguing and actually telling a more chilling story.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Changing from the demon haunting the house and Ed / Lorraine working out what type of entity this is. To change to how the demon was summoned and investigating in the real world who brought this demon to the world is a good change to keep things fresh.As all of the stories are written by James Wan he seems to be keeping tabs on all of the main movies along with the spin offs but choosing his team of horror directors. I have to say this isnt as stylish as a James Wan directed horror movie but the few scares there are still dont follow the play book... which is great! One does stand out where you would think looking into a blackened hole you'd see a face appear from the darkness. But no they wait until hes turned around for the demon to be right behind and this shook me up!The Investigation take you on a twist and turn to find the Satanist that conjured the demon and thats cursing the family from the opening scene along with Ed and Lorraine themselves. The twist in the story is easy to spot as its a 50/50 on which way you'd think this will go.With all of these films the main cast is great along with the supporting cast not making it obvious and leaves the audience able to work out the story for themselves. Not pandering to the common trope that Hollywood has gone for in over explaining everything.

I also can't get enough of gnarly possessions and I has a lot of that. The film itself has some interesting - it half baked - ideas and was entertaining enough and decently made but...The Bad: that's kind of it. It's a shockingly mediocre film and because of the Conjuring name, that really hurts it. This film feels like a Netflix horror movie: cheap and, a bit uninspired. It's not remotely scary, the villain really needed more screen presence and the ""legal drama"" it purports to be is completely abandoned a quarter of the way in. It was such a missed opportunity to meld these seemingly divergent genres.The Ugly: okay, that title. I don't know why, but it comes off as extremely silly and honestly cheapens this film's stature in the Conjuring franchise. Why not call it the Conjuring 3?

178,Benslie,Had so much potential but ended up flopping,5,20 June 2021,"Honestly, there was only one good thing in this movie and that was the cinematography. They got creative with lighting for certain scenes and it helped show the tone of the scenes. The acting in this film was just passable in my opinion which is sad. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were still trying to give it their all as these people, but it just didn't feel like they had the same passion as they did for the other two movies. This could be because James Wan wasn't directing this movie that it felt off. Michael Chaves did his best with this movie and I will say that it was better than his last movie, ""The Curse of La Llorona"" but he might not have been the best choice to try and helm this story. James Wan did a great job with scares in the previous two movies but in this one, it was just cliché jump scares that you could see coming. Upon doing research into the true story of this movie we could've gotten such a better movie. I feel like this movie should've spent a good hour just setting up the curse storyline or doing what the other movies did with focusing on the family because I didn't care at all for any of these people. Then the last part of the movie could be about the trial since I really wanted to see the trial instead of an episode of, ""The X-Files"" with Ed and Lorraine. Aside from not caring about any of these people, one of my biggest problems in this movie was the editing. The editing would just cut away from a scene when it felt like there was more to that scene but cut it due to time constraints.

They went out on a limb and it's not too shabby whatsoever. I enjoyed it all the more for the direction it took. Sure, the kids won't like it but at least it's not sold itself out by being what others want and having the guts to be a little different. It's a more adult type horror in a way. The 6.4 is actually a very decent rating for a 3rd sequel. It happens in every horror franchise, from A Nightmare on Elm Street to Friday the 13th, Halloween and so on.

182,WooderIce64,Could've Been Worse,6,26 August 2021,"The Conjuring has been one of the most successful horror franchises of recent years. The first two are the work of James Wan, who also did Saw and Insidious. Wan did not return to direct the third film, The Devil Made Me Do It, which everyone just calls Conjuring 3. Generally, that's a bad sign, but the product is decent (definitely better than the Saw and Insidious sequels). It's based on the 1981 trial of Arne Johnson, who claimed he was possessed by a demon when he killed his landlord.As a horror movie, it's okay. The overt paranormal elements of the first two are eschewed in favor of a more creepy occult-oriented terror. This actually does work on its own, even if it's not what you'd expect out of a Conjuring movie. Rather than demons, they are up against witchcraft. With this in mind, it makes the jumpscares way less effective than they are in the first two movies. It also feels more like a mystery movie. Even if it doesn't handle this as well as it could, it's an interesting new direction. Without giving anything away, there are some predictable plot points. Some of the scenes involving clairvoyance, which are present in the first two, are interesting as well.One of the best aspects of the first two movies is noticeably absent. There is virtually no bond between Arne and the Warrens. The first movie barely has the Warrens at all and the scenes with them are based on their relationship with the Perrons. The second is as much about the bond between the Warrens and the Hodgsons as it is the paranormal stuff. Here, however, there is none of that, and the movie is worse off for it. It makes it feel like any other supernatural horror movie, rather than a proper follow-up to the other two Conjuring movies. Granted, it does focus on the relationship between Ed and Lorraine, but that happens in the other movies as well.Conjuring 3 is definitely a downgrade from its two predecessors, but it's a decent film in its own right. It's different from the other two, but there's still enough to recommend it to horror fans or fans of the first two. That, and this is definitely better than some of the spin-offs.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
183,alexscott-35299,A nice surprise,7,28 May 2021,"I went in to this film not expecting much, I really enjoyed the other 2 conjuring films but something about this one just didn't look appealing to me. I was so wrong to think that. This film is another brilliant entry into James Wans amazing horror franchise. The scares were creative and different and not all predictable, the storyline again was brilliant and engaging, the acting as always in these films was brilliant and again the main two actors were great. I'm very surprised by this one and look forward to see where the series goes from here. Fantastic surprise!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

It took horror to bring movie goers back in droves on the launch night and out of Covid hiding to witness the Third Chapter in ""The Conjuring"" franchise.""The Devil Made Me Do It"" is a really well produced, directed and edited original title about the continuing real-life adventures of Paranormal Investigators, the Warrens.In this case based on a true story that shocked America in the 80's about a self-confessed murderer who used demonic possession as his defence in court, for the first time in the history of the US Justice system.It had been used before, unsuccessfully in a case in the UK.This chapter of ""The Conjuring"" is part Horror, Mystery, Thriller and Law & Order in equal doses.Patrick Wilson returns as Ed Warren and his wife, Lorraine is yet again played by Vera Farmiga.The movie is quick to open with the Exorcism of a young boy being conducted in the home of the Glatzel family.Their youngest child David is seemingly possessed and Director Michael Chaves cast ""The Haunting Of Hill House"" child star, Julian Hilliard in this role.The third child from that 2018 Netflix series to act in a Conjuring movie.One of the real stars of this production is the Sound Designer, Jason W. Jennings and Composer, Joseph Bishara who together with the sound department create a chilling musical and sound effects driven base for this genre that fills an XD theatre.The story for this movie allegedly came from the 1983 book ""The Devil in Connecticut"" about Arne Cheyenne Johnson who killed his landlord in 1981.Was it drugs, booze or the devil who made him do it and at what price, if any, will he have to pay to save his soul?Wait for the end credits to see the real players and the actors who portrayed them and the outcome of this case.Fun Fact: Lorraine Warren lived a full life and died a natural death aged 92 in 2019. Up till then she had been a head consultant on these movies and an avid follower of the series.If you liked ""The Nun"", ""The Curse of The Weeping Woman"", ""Annabelle Comes Home"" and the other ""Conjuring"" feature films then you're in for a spooky treat and it's not even Halloween yet.The body count at just 5 isn't alarmingly high for a Horror movie, but this chilling story of terror, murder and the unknown will haunt you long after you leave the cinema.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

I hate lost potential of a good scene in a crappy movie so that almost just pissed me off more lol:( anyway ya, bad I was so disinterested by the end I wasn't even watching just a jumbling up of scenes,cgi,no scares,ugh why is Vera Fermiga (who I like) sticking around for this!

188,ubasarsahin,I apologize to Michael Chaves !!!,10,4 June 2021,"As I mentioned on the title of my review, I really want to apologize to Michael Chaves. I've been so harsh on La Llorona with my reviews and I'd thought that Conjuring 3'd be in danger. But I regret thinking this so so so so so much! No filmmaker has ever surprised me this much before! Thank you Michael Chaves!!! Thank you! Thank you! And Thank you! You did a incredible job!!!As a fan of Conjuring Universe, I can easily say that The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is in my top 3. I couldn't decide the order yet but it surely is in top 3. I loved everything about this movie. Especially the fresh taste in the air. I loved seeing Ed & Lorraine Warren fighting with this Satanic power with everything they've got. I loved seeing them getting outside of the main places and keep discovering new things at different locations. I loved watching their this dangereous journey. Every scene has it's own tense and the movie itself can make you feel that. I loved the fact that Ed and Lorraine was in a serious danger this time. More than we've ever seen on big screen. Trying to murder eachother was so crazy. I just kept my breath in these scenes. It was so thrilling for me to see them do this.I loved the opening sequence. And despite other reviews, I didn't see the movie going down after that sequence. I think, it just kept it's pace and got more exciting with every new scene. I loved the new actors/new actresses. I think they all did a great job. Ruairi O'Connor was great. Julian Hilliard doing it again, this kid is so talented! And especially, for me, Vera Farmiga is shining. I fell in love with her again. And finally, in this particular movie, Patrick Wilson had to his best more than ever. I don't think his part in this movie was that easy. Playing someone is older than him, and, with a heart disease? OMG! Patrick, you were phenomenal. Not every actor can do that!Overall, after all of these positives, it's very clear that I can't give this movie a lower rating than 10. Congrats everyone!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
189,ericdhall77,"Meh, okay",5,13 June 2021,An okay watch but def not the best in the franchise by any means. It lacks much of a storyline other than a basic possession movie. Reminded me of the Exorcist is many ways.,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

191,thefendiprint,"Dull, lifeless and not a drop of scary",3,5 June 2021,"I seriously am confused by some of these high ratings... Did we watch the same movie? This was objectively the worst of the franchise, and simply as a film, it was pretty bad overall. Nothing in the film was scary, and honestly it played it way too safe the entire time. There is absolutely nothing new here story wise that we haven't seen in every other demon-centered horror film. Nothing that stands out, nothing that will make this film memorable by any means. Is it the worst horror film I've seen? No, but it's definitely one of the most lackluster I've seen.Love defeats the demon? Really? How corny and utterly unrealistic. Just like the Insidious films, it's clear the franchise has run out of ideas and will crank anything out to appease fans. Watch it if you must, but don't expect a riveting horror experience by any means. Just rewatch the first two, they are infinitely better. Please dear god just let this franchise end.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
192,seige-hound,"Nowhere near as scary as the first two movies, plot is lacking",5,13 June 2021,"As a fan of the Conjuring movies, I was very disappointed in this third episode. I had inklings that the film wouldn't be as good as the first 2 movies, as James Wan is no longer the director, only acting as producer for this film, but I was willing to give this film a shot.The Conjuring 3 is once again loosely based on real events, this time surrounding the court case of Arne Johnson. The real case happened like this: Arne Johnson killed his landlord after the landlord assaulted Arne's girlfriend. Arne had connections with the Warren's as his girlfriend's younger brother went through an exorcism with the Warren's help. Lorraine Warren claimed after Arne's arrest that he was possessed by a demon, but the court dismissed this claim as unprovable in a court of law, so instead the defence attorney went with a self defence plea, which succeeded in reducing his murder sentence to manslaughter.That's a basic summary of what actually happened, but the movie just goes crazy with adding all sorts of details that pretty much distract from the actual 'true' parts of the movie. So in the movie, Arne's possession was caused by the daughter of a Catholic priest who was involved in stopping a satanic cult, but the daughter grew obsessed with the occult, and for some unknown reason started summoning demons to do some sort of ritual.Compare this to the other two movies: The first Conjuring the main antagonist is a demonic witch, the second is a demonic nun. The third is just some weird woman who likes making totems out of bones and summonding demons. The stakes of this film are incredibly low compared to the other films.Also the court case is all but forgotten by this film. I was kinda expecting something similar to The Exorcism of Emily Rose, but for the most part they just handwave away that plot point in favour of the much less interesting fictional adventures of Ed and Lorraine as they try and stop the weird lady.Also the movie isn't scary at all. It tries to emulate James Wan's directorial style, but weird editing choices, bad demon design and way more fake jump scares than any other Conjuring movie makes this film an utter failure to match up with Wan's original vision of the series.Just ignore this movie. It isn't really worth it.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

I never miss a horror film let along the Conjuring. I have so far loved this franchise, although I don't believe in religious nonsense. The films have been entertaining so far, and even meaningful (i.e. La llorona).This one felt like a cheap copy and paste of cliché horror scenes. For example, upon arrival, the father was dressed and filmed just like father Merrin from the Exorcist. Come on, Conjuring!I'm not a drama fan; however any strong film can keep my awake at any time. For this one I kept waiting for the tension to start, and it never happened!I literally fell asleep on the couch in the middle (which was already quite a chore to get through to).Do I want to finish it tonight?

It's used as a very lazy tool to keep the plot moving which is HEAVILY relied on in the latter half of the film.

Lack of scares, over long considering the plot, boring in the middle for far too long and just silly at the end. It was very obvious that James Wan was missing as the director and that this wasn't written by the Hayes brothers.

The good thing is, the scares worked out well for me the tension and build up were good.This time, Ed and Lorraine are mostly in focus rather than the victims they are investigating about. Not really a fan of that love angle that plays at the climax looks kinda stupid although the performances were good.Another good thing is that it is fast paced.

222,cristinalinderman,An enjoyable film but it lacked the terror element.,6,9 June 2021,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Michael Chaves and crew brought an enjoyable film but it lacked the terror element. I like the Conjuring Universe there are many good horror films, and among those movies, my favorite ones are The Conjuring (2013) and The Conjuring 2 (2016). I was excited about another one and when I watched the trailer I was more thrilled but what I didn't expect was how different the direction was going to be knowing that it was a different director. The 2 films of The Conjuring brought many terror moments setting the suspense in a very frightful way which made those films excellent. Though this new film failed completely in bringing back the terror, I felt like I was watching a horror/adventure film.This story focuses more on The Warren couple due to the chosen case it was not like the other 2 films which the direction was a balance between The Warren and the family possessed. I don't want to think that since it was more about The Warren it couldn't drive the terror element where it belonged because there were many scenes that could bring more suspense but instead just gave a creepy vibe. It's ironic because one of the things I was so excited about this film was the main focus of The Warren couple and especially on Vera Farmiga getting the shine she deserves. Even though this didn't make it on my list of great horror films it was still a good film. The main theme of the story was love and I did enjoy the way they projected how strong their love was.The composer Joseph Bishara had previously worked in The Conjuring Universe and I was shocked at how his music was a disappointment. The composer can't be blamed since the direction and the story aren't at the pick of suspense feeling that the music was just in the way and will not have the effect needed for the scenes.The cast was solid mainly towards Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. They always give a fantastic performance and their chemistry makes their bond so strong for their roles.

I believe I saw my first shot-reverse-shot jumpscare in a film, but I can't be too sure since my brain stopped functioning half-way through the film. I think a character screamed at the camera, which turned to Ed and Lorraine I think their names are, then turned back and the character screamed again in the exact same manner.

Keep watching our trite movies and shoveling that popcorn down your gullets."" <-- That's what they're thinking as you continue to support these absolutely embarrassing excuses for films. They don't view you as a person when you watch these films. You're merely data, and they think they're entitled to your time and money.Thankfully it's a step up from The Nun, The Curse of La Loorona, and Annabelle, but unfortunately it's not good enough to earn a 1/10 from me.

However, this newest addition seems determined to stretch any attachment to reality beyond where any reasonable audience can believe anything & so I didn't.The producers are so intent on sticking with a 'true story' that they're now having to use material that simply doesn't adapt well to a Hollywood horror romp. Although it's a great premise & if you stick with it right to the end you even get to hear some 'source material', the majority of the film is just utter nonsense. I'm fine with nonsense, I watch it all the time, but most nonsense doesn't purport to be based in reality & this is where The Conjuring universe is starting to collapse in on itself. Unfortunately, unless it ditches it's link to the Warrens, this downward trajectory will only continue, ending in the depths of development hell no doubt.Great performances & solid production values aren't good enough to elevate weak source material, bless the Warrens, but it's now time to let them rest in peace.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Ed and Lorraine are the characters that definitely carry these film, and the heavy emphasis on them in this one pays off with them.

Moving towards witches and curses was fine but there was no connection between the victims, purpose for the curse was never discovered, the selection of the victims was also unclear. The devil made me do it is the name of the movie but we never get a chance to see the devil/demon, only humans. The devil at the end who came to take the soul was also in a human form.

232,grarunkumar1994,A Good Horror Film. Not worth to be conjuring sequel.,6,4 June 2021,"Conjuring 3 , was a much expected installment of the series. The impression James Wan created with the first film was so high that the sequel even after being a well made one, was criticized by some for not being as good as the first. This film however is clearly the least scary/ least thrilling film of the series.As a film, this has a good story, well developed characters and good production value. However the most important factor, James Wan on director's chair, was missing which made all the difference.The film unlike the prequels doesn't establish the characters entering a new home in the beginning. Instead it starts mid exorcism, which was surprisingly good as time is not wasted to establish much but the film returns to it later as flashback sequence. Jump scares are very minimal and as a fact, this is a supernatural crime drama instead of a horror thriller.Since this was the final film of the series, it was very disappointing as a conjuring film but a good one for sure..
The director of ""La larona's curse"" was the director. Both the films are just easily forgettable and not worth a repeated watch unlike the prequels.Wan should've stayed as dircetor.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
233,NpMoviez,Yet another generic and stupid exorcism movie which we've seen million times,4,6 June 2021,"People : You weren't planning to watch it but still you did. Why did you watch the movie?Me : I don't know .... May be THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT.It's a lot better than the Annabelle 1 and 3, The Nun and La Llorona. But it's easy to be better than them. I think the story (just the story) was quite good (if you're supposed to narrate it). It's kinda great to see the Lorraine Warren and Ed Warren's love story, but it took over the actual story of the movie. It was cheesy at times and felt like a grown up version of ""Twilight"". Some sequences were nice. But they were just nice sequences and didn't really serve a huge purpose for the story it was supposed to tell. If you take them out, the movie is still complete.The storytelling reminded me of The Ring, except the reveals and the twists weren't interesting and were just ""bleh"". The scenes are quite reminiscent of The Exorcist in many ways, except that in The Exorcist everything theyshowed was within the context of a horrifying story and here, it was merely a stock scene for a film like this. And like every other movie of this kind it has those on your face jumpscares and loud noises. The tropes of The Exorcist work for The Exorcist because it is itself a great movie, and they weren't done to death when during the early 70s. It's a cliché today. You gotta make it work properly. You need to have a proper storytelling. Loud bass and cheap jumpscares aren't horror. The first two Conjuring films used similar tropes but told a great story and had a great storytelling. The scares and bass were used only for enhancing the storytelling aspect. That's why those films worked, and that's why every other movie in the horror universe kick-started by James Wan and not directed by him don't really work.So, it's a watered down version of The Exorcist, The Ring and some stupid generic voodoo movie. That's what it is. Movies like these make me feel like it's James Wan, Mike Flanagan and John Krazinski who are the only ones who know how to do a horror movie properly these days.Rating: 4/10, Grade: D+",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
234,xrionitx,Degraded version,2,5 June 2021,"This was more of the Hallucinations, more of jump scares, filled with dream sequences and less of actual things shown...
The element of scare was nowhere found, just a fantasy fairy tale land, with some expedition to find someone bad with the hallucinating dreams to get telepathically connected..
Sometimes its so much of those illusions that you get confused whether to buy the scare or its just another fooling dream sequence... which makes you irritated whether to think it happened or it did not... And if didn't happen then why is everyone hallucinating like they are on mushrooms...

Overlong, tired and not scary at all, pic coasts along the warmth of Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson's portrayal as Lorraine and Ed Warren - this time, trying to prove that a murderer (real life character Arne Johnson) who stabbed his landlord 22 times did it because he was demonically possessed. It's all kind of tedious, with director Chavez attempting scares by throwing the whole Exorcist kitchen sink at the screen (you know, crashing thunder, hissing voices, body contortions , levitation). Unfortunately, nothing works. Pretty damning when the eeriest moment in the film is a (supposedly) true audio recording of an exorcism caught on tape.

239,craigthomas90,The expanded universe infects The original.,6,11 June 2021,"Unfortunately, when it comes to most franchises, the 3rd movie in a trilogy, is often the weakest; this trend holds true. 'The Devil Made Me Do It,' lacks the connective tissue that makes the first two great like, The subtlety, the unexpected frightening aspects that make you jump. The 3rd is too random and convenient. It does not flow as well. It is difficult to connect because it's too sudden. It feels as though things happen in two nights. The desperation that can be felt within the first two movies is absent here. The Warren's are grizzled veterans when it comes to exorcisms yet, they are fumbling around like it is a badly written 80's horror. The first two movies possess a strong family element that engulfs the viewer, this film plays out like let's get this over with, and get some icecream. Ed and Lorraine tend to have supportive back ground roles, this movie is more about the couple than ever before. It is sappy, with some Zack Synder slow motion scenes that made me cringe more than the horror elements.

The premise was relatively fresh and different from the previous installments. And Farmiga and Wilson are still an iconic power couple in the world of horror. They always deliver great acting and has great chemistry.But... this was very... not scary. The first ten minutes were the absolute scariest, and despite them hyping that this case would be one of the most horrific the Warrens have taken on, they didn't really deliver on that? I was far more scared by the first and second movie, and one character that was supposed to be scary was downright laughable.I left the theater slightly disappointed, which is a shame because I love The Conjuring and especially the last two installments.

Yes, it's admittedly not as superb as the first two, but it's still a fantastic movie on its own, and still a worthy entry into the franchise. The heart and soul of this movie are, of course, the Warrens, and boy do they deliver once again, their chemistry is ridiculous, such relationship goals and wholesomeness almost shouldn't exist in this type of movie, but man, am I glad it does. The cinematography and style was all great, and the story was amazing too. It wasn't as terrifying as the other two movies, yes, but like I said, I suspect this is largely just due to the fact that James Wan didn't direct it.

The Conjuring 3 is probably the least scary movie among the other Conjuring films. Plain plot (undoubtedly the true story it's based on isn't as attractive as the other cases), ordinary characters (very formatted actually), and the theme that's expressed verbally which makes it even less credible.

The Curse of La Llorona should have ensured he didn't get another job doing a horror movie and so I went into this expecting to walk out half way through, like last time. My feelings not helped by the poor title ""The Devil Made Me Do It"".That being said, it's a solid enough entry into The Conjuring universe which has been going downhill for a while now. Ed and Lorraine actually feel in danger in this one and it steps away from the haunted house formula to offer us something different. You still have spooky moments which will probably have the teenagers jumping but - where this film excels is the sound design.The story was interesting, set pieces decent and I was entertained from start to finish although, by the end of it, I was glad it had finished because I was beginning to get bored.Tomorrow, I will most likely have forgotten most of this film.

So bland, so predictable, so dry, and oh so completely devoid of scares. Have a friend over one night and give them 10 dollars to randomly pop balloons, it will be 54 times scarier. This movie defines a scare as a contortionist, growling, exploding windows, and creatures that hold still for 3 seconds before darting at the camera. Literally.

Without him the scares while still really good were not up to the same par as the first two movies.The first two movies left me afraid to go to sleep afterwards, checking under my bed and my cupboard at the slightest noise and had we going to the bathroom on my tiptoes hoping not to awaken a sinister or deadly presence.The Devil Made Me Do It had good scares and was scary enough to qualify as both a conjuring film and a horror film, however it does not meet the standards of the first two movies.The storyline was great, I mean they can't go wrong their considering it's based on a actual case, thou the made up murder sub-plot was so-so... the effects were brilliant and the scares were good. The actors and actresses did an amazing job and as usual Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga had us routing for them, thou new comer actress Sarah Katherine Hook and her on screen sweetheart Arne Johnson were a close second!

257,ranwulfs,"Movies about demons, etc. that cite Christian theology should go the rest of the way.",1,8 June 2021,"Whether or not you believe in God, the devil, things that go bump in the night, etc. Is irrelevant when it comes to these types of movies. But if the writers are going to invoke Christian theology and use the Christian Bible out of context, they should try to get at least *something* right. In every single movie of this ilk, Christians are shown to be absolutely powerless over Satan and his minions o' darkness - whether those minions be witches, demons, Amway salespeople, or rude baristas. We're relentlessly inundated with Catholic priest characters who are about as spiritually flacid as a used latex glove. Why is that? If the writers can use and even extol the power of the devil, why not show the rest of the theology they borrowed him from? And I don't mean the countless scenes of non-Christians trying to invoke the name of Jesus - which is hysterically funny, btw - but maybe have the ""hero"" be a Bible-thumping, born-again zealot who knows his/her scripture. I mean, these writers are already cribbing bits and pieces from the Bible to begin with, cherry-picking as it were, taking everything out of context for the sake of jump scares and lame drama - why not go the rest of the way? Personally, I'd pay good money to see a horror movie in which a wild-eyed fundamentalist Christian casts out demons in the name of Jesus, just for a change of pace. Doubtless, any screenplay like that would never see the light of day, though: real Christians would never make it, and Hollywood would never make it. But if they did, and it got proper publicity and distribution, it'd be a game changer for the whole ""devils & demons"" genre. I'd certainly go see it.This third installment of the ""Conjuring"" franchise - or eighth: I long ago lost count - is as full of misrepresentations of Christian theology as the preceding films in the series. Not that it seems to bother anyone - after all, the granddaddy of them all, ""The Exorcist,"" did just that by showing a weak and utterly powerless Christian clergy. Why Farmiga and Wilson continue to roll in this mire of bad writing and terrible storyline is beyond me. Maybe they've both gone broke and need to make a mortgage payment - who knows? The only people who will enjoy watching this movie are die-hard fans of the franchise who want to have every single one of the films under their belt.

The Conjuring
Annabelle
InsidiousThis is a great example of a movie universe where people don't care about vision, originality or viewer experience and care mostly about the box office, so they use the same formula over and over and over and over again, making the same films throughout the years that people just keep consuming without second thought. You can call it ""classic approach to horror"", I call it just pure laziness at this point. Some people say that about Marvel films, but I would strongly disagree on that one: when you get to Marvel's scriptwriting: how evolved their characters and how interconnected the 20 years of their mythology actually is - it can be impeccable. They are the Greek Myths of the 21st century. ""Fast and Furious"", ""The Conjuring/Anabelle"" films and the ""Saw"" franchise all fall into the lazy cliche category. Yes, the first couple of them might have been interesting, but after all these years when you know the plot of upcoming film before you even started watching it - it's crap. This Conjuring is, as always, filled with jumpscares (as if in the 21st century this is the only way you can make somebody scared), and you will know exactly when the jumscares are coming up and what sort of jumpscare it's going to be. You know where the story is going and how it is eventually going to end. You already watched this movie without having watched it.It's tragic, really, with the amount of fan support and money they have (39 mil. $. As a reference ""Midsommar"" had 9 mil. $ budget and ""The Lighthouse"" had 4.) they could hire competent screenwriters and directors that know how to think for themselves a little bit and bring new ideas to the table.

I was wrong though, this movie is competent. It's also boring.Keep in mind that I'm not invested in this series or characters whatsoever. I liked the first Conjuring, liked the atmosphere and I thought it was an effective horror thriller. Not a fan of the second one, but still decent. The third installment I found to be tedious, I even had to rewind at some point because I dowsed off. No suspense, barely anything I would call horror and I never cared about the mystery. They were trying to find who was behind it and in the end, it was indeed someone behind it. I liked the scene in the morgue, that's it.It also includes a trial. The premise, while not really integral to the plot, is that they are trying to acquit someone on the basis of demonic possession. This quickly turns into finding and stopping the one responsible, so it wasn't much of an issue for me, but still, I thought it was silly.I don't have much to complain about really. It is well shot, decently acted, but I just found the script to be so boring, it made it very hard to appreciate anything this move had to offer.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
264,politicidal,The Devil Made Me Watch It. Can't Say It Was Entirely Worth It.,5,11 October 2021,"An inferior followup to the earlier Conjuring movies, this third installment does feature the Warrens again but the case is not as interesting as it sounds.Based off the media circus surrounding a murder suspect claiming demonic possession (yes true story), the movie tries to shake things up by being a trial movie with elements of a police procedural that happens to feature exorcism.That's not bad on paper but the director Michael Chaves is not capable to make it interesting. There's a noticeable reliance on jump scares and the pacing seems off. Like there's scenes cut or missing. There are a number of scenes that are explained away with text crawls.Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are as watchable as ever as Lorraine and Ed Warren and they still have good chemistry together.

I would rather this movie been put on hold so James Wan could be the one to begin and finish it.The reason I think this movie fails largely falls on the director, his previous films all suck, the Curse of La Llorona was a heap of garbage (and I love Linda Cardellini). I just don't think he has a grasp on how to balance emotion with horror and its elements properly... for example, suspense (music gives it away in an instant, when silence can be much more potent), or his choice of thrill (weak-ass annoying jump scares), then the lack of emotion and the pace. The lack of emotion is the element lacking in this film, there were no moments of despair. I agree with many of those who actually criticized the film for not presenting real threats to any of the characters once again; its the third film and we have really yet to see the stakes go high.

273,moviematthewh-60783,The originality is gone,4,4 June 2021,"When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was a good idea that they expanded the setting so that it wasn't just a haunted house kind of setting. But after the film ended, oh how that was a mistake. The story introduces us to too many characters who we know nothing about and gives us too many plot holes that are just left unanswered. The films genre was more of a crime thriller than a horror to be honest film lacked in scares which lost the films horror genre/ theme. The change in genre didn't suit me personally as I expected this film to live up to the tension and scares shown in the first two films. The scares that we're in the film were bad. I barely jumped at any of them or felt nervous when they happened. It just wasn't a horror movie I felt. The film is essentially an info dump and doesn't answer any questions to why were given the information. The ending was also very weak, unlike the first two films which actually had a scary finale, this one just lacked in scares and turned more slasher almost at times. Because of the films plot being more crime focused, I saw many tropes from other films in this film, which made the film lack in originality. The other two films were unique as they hadn't been done before (or at least done but not in the quality as the conjuring has), so this film feels just as a reboot to any crime/drama/thriller story we've all seen multiple times. The trailer was misleading, and it also showed many of the main scares and some scenes that were somewhat important to the plot, so the reveal of these scenes and story moments weren't as exciting as if we'd never seen them in a trailer before. Only thing I really enjoyed was Ed and Lorraine Warren's actors/actresses, they still played their characters very well. Overall, weakest of the trilogy, but better than some of the spin-offs we've been given. Really wanted to like this film as I was a fan of the first two, but sadly I was very disappointed.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
274,JoelAlexanderr,Not the same without James Wan,4,20 June 2021,"THE CONJURING: THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT is the first movie in The Conjuring series not to be directed by James Wan, and unfortunately he is sorely missed. This third entry is by far the worst of the three, and it never even gets close to living up to the high standard that the other two set for the franchise. The opening scene shows promise that the rest of the movie will be an intense and personal possession movie, but as the film goes on it becomes clear that the movie is more focused on useless tangents than giving audiences a compelling and terrifying story.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are still good here, but some of the dialogue they are given to say is criminally cheesy. At multiple points, the lines of dialogue are either straight out of a soap opera or predictable word-for-word seconds before they are spoken. Much of what makes the first two Conjuring films so great is missing here -- specifically the connection the audience has with the main family who has fallen victim to demonic spirits. I never felt an emotional connection with the main family in this film, so I was never invested in the story as a whole. However, the main thing that's missing here is what every horror movie needs to have. Scares. I can't say I was frightened by one scene in this whole movie, which is a stark contrast to being scared by almost every other scene in the first two films.There is a lot worse out there when it comes to horror, but it's still disappointing to see this forgettable of a film come out of a franchise that had been so excellent up to this point. Next time I feel that they should either get James Wan to come back or scrap the project altogether if it cannot be worked out. C-",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

277,WillsFilms,The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It Conjures a Mess,5,19 June 2021,"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is, by far, the weakest of the Conjuring trilogy. Unlike the first two, this movie doesn't spend a lot of time with the victims before the scares begin. Instead this film elects to primarily focus on the Warrens' investigation into the cause of the haunting. While Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga do a great job as usual, with their brilliant chemistry intact, this film demonstrates why they don't work at the centre of the narrative. The investigation, which takes up most of the runtime, isn't particularly exciting to watch and causes the film to become slow and tedious and whenever a scare does happen, it's usually a boring jump scare rather than anything particularly frightening. Also, the increased screen time devoted to the Warrens, and the aforementioned decreased screen time for the victims, means that the victims are underdeveloped and so I don't care about their situation. A shame as that was the greatest strength of the previous films. In terms of strengths, Patrick Wilson delivers probably his best performance of the trilogy and there are a couple of genuinely disturbing scenes, as well as a brilliant sequence during the climax, which almost cleanses this film from its sins. However, those few strengths aside, The Devil Made Me Do It is nothing more than your standard bad horror movie, which is a shame as its predecessors were so much more.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

The only scary bit is the opening scene; an exorcism that sees the demon transferred from one brother to another. But pretty much that is the story.Dialogue is terrible. The 160 minutes could be cut to 90 mins which would increase the sense of continuity and make the film that little bit more haunting.The worst bit is when Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) gets pulled off a cliff by a demons hand. Enter a stunt double who appears to be a man who is taller and heavier, and you can see this.To the film company, don't make another. Drop it whilst the going is, well, okay.

Still Conjuring 3 stands out with its major highlights such as the creepy sets, water bed scene and its new investigation style storyline. Surprisingly this adventure adds some beautiful light hearted moments between Ed and Lorraine which was a delight to watch. Cinematography at times were praiseworthy especially the day to night transition scenes are lit. Last but not the least, the end credits with the real footages of the same case adds to the trustability of the storyline.Coming to cons, The bone cackling CGI were enjoyable at the beginning but tires off due to its constant repetition.

They are the best things these core Conjuring movies have to offer. Their chemistry is great. The movie also is very well directed. There is definitely a visual eye from director Micheal Chaves. The movie is very well shot, and the scares are very well set up.

The issues I have is that while the story is very interesting, it doesn't fully live up to the cool potential it could've had. The storytelling is a little messy. There are some times where the pacing is a little slow in parts. The movie also adds a little too much in the movie which kinda deviates itself from the main story. This makes the main part of the movie not as interesting.But overall ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"", is a very good film that has some pacing issues, and doesn't have the best storytelling, but great performances, good direction, and very well crafted scares make this movie a hell of a good time.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

I have a book on black magic and evil magicians by Abdul Salaam Bali someone who excorcised spirits out of human bodies which were cast onto them by evil dark magic, some of them even cried and accepted God's true faith while coming out of the bodies .. these things are very spiritual to be understoodSo the Warren's, real life demonologists come across a case back in the eighties .. which is more harder to understand than it looks to solve. A Satanist lady summons evil spirits and casts them onto households either for personal revengeful vendettas or mainly just for pleasure .. so the Warren's find a way to break the altar on which the evil practice was conjured in order to break the spell and the demon of the evil witch kills her as a revenge, cause she didn't get the job done, Ed Warren struggles as a demon almost seized his heart back in the start of the film, so through the film he's ill . But in short all these people are the fuel of the hellfire, those who conjure black magic, summon evil spirits by indoctrinated evil ritualistic practices and a piece of knowledge which was learnt to harm the people not to benefit them .. and the punishment in reality for anyone who practices them in reality is death too in the Law of God.

The Warren's still stole the showThey did seem to cut out some bits, assumedly were to be included but cut to reduce the film to around 2hrs. For instance at one point Ed told someone he would introduce them to Annabelle to show that what they did was real but you never see that happen.A familiar face also returns to join the Warren's but that's about it as far as links to the other 6 moviesTo keep it short as others have already said what is to be said.It's more of a murder/mystery with some horror elements and overly loud sound effects and a love story thrown in to cement the bond between the Warren's.At just under 2hrs it wasn't a drag but the last 30mins were definately alot faster then the first 90minsThe actress who played Debbie Glatzel, is the Soda Stream Ad girl lol and Ruairi O'Connor who plays Arne, in the movie is a dead ringer for a Skaarsgard but in real life is a llok alike of Skaarsgard/Ramsay Bolton lol.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

This movie isn't scary and more thrilling and can't classify itself as a conjuring film without the engagement and due to its floppy story towards the end.

Most of the scares were really bad, and didn't have the same tones and feel that Conjuring had kept during its first two.While this is better than it's spin-off Annabelle it isn't anything special either. Some of it really didn't seem to work even though it was based on a true story, the whole thing felt a little lackluster. It was hard to really feel as empathetic for this one as it was so similar to the 2nd that I half expected Valek all over again.While Vera and Patrick's performance was on key as usual, they missed the mark with this Director, he just didn't have James Wan's imagery and vision.

Michael Chaves does better than I expected him to do as director, with many scenes similar to Wan's scare formula. Joseph Bishara creates a new track that still adds a lot of tension to the movies moments, the best scene being the awesome forest scene. Compared to the other entries in the franchise The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is a pretty big step back while still being successful. The story is very intriguing but gets messier as the plot evolves, and definitely could've used a bit more James Wan. Another flaw is the movie paces back from the paranormal and actually leans toward a slasher flick. I don't think that was the goal but it happens about three quarters in, about where everything else goes slightly south as well.

The movie of this caliber in the phones just felt underwhelming because it deserves to be be on the biggest screen. The movie had one of. Best cinematography and VFX in the entire franchise. It's much more of a Cinema than some jump scare and make up prosthetics. The story progression with flashbacks of past within the present of two families were beautifully shown throughout the film.

When the kid is getting exorcised, how the parents conveniently walk downstairs when the whole commotion is over. I understand the dad had an injured leg but come on! At least show that they tried to come down and some power kept them back,2. How come after Arne takes the curse inside him, he doesn't tell anyone and decides to deal with it himself, I mean dude you just saw what this can do and more over he wanted to marry the girl and get her tangled into it further.3.

336,vedvaghela,Not Conjuring.,5,19 June 2021,"The change of director is felt at the instant. Not saying that the direction was bad, per se, but it wasn't in keeping with what we've seen in the past renditions of Conjuring universe.Let's start with the pros: I loved the leads as always. Both Vera and Patrick are great. I love seeing them as the demonic investigators and as a couple. Other side actors were great too. O'Connor as Arne played a good role of an innocent taken over by something haunted. It had a great premise.And now the Cons: It wasn't scary. Not once was my heartbeat slowed while I was waiting for a jumpscare. Also, after the movie ended, it didn't follow me home. I guess this could be one of the downfalls of leaving the ""haunted house"" storyline. As said, the premise was solid but it wasn't built upon too well. I would've loved it if they actually showed the court proceedings of ""the first case of trial of demonic possession"", and they instead went with the usual horror movie tropes. And the tropes weren't that good. It missed the signature conjuring style. One other point that stinger me was that they left too many important details unexplored. Also too many things happened when needed.Very few trilogies have all 3 strong movies. Conjuring had 2/3, but missed on the 3rd one. I'm hoping that more Conjuring movies come, and yes, I will definitely see them, but this was just not it.

Very cheesy and unnatural. But the acting was good and sufficient.All in all, it's a Conjuring movie. Okay, but nothing ourstanding.If you've never watched any Conjuring movies and only want to watch one, I'd recommend only the first one.If you've watched the first and/or second and liked it, then you should watch this.If you didn't like the first or second Conjuring, then don't bother with this.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Instead, the movie uses all the horror film tropes we're used to.Btw, I was hopeful that the defendant's lawyers would argue that actual demonic possession was irrelevant - only what the defendant BELIEVED was demonic possession was relevant. But the lawyers (in the actual case) argued straight demonic possession, which the judge, unsurprisingly, barred because the defense can't be proved.Inferior to the other two movies in the series.

But it still isn't the same creepy as the other movies. Without comparing it to the other films it's actually good. But I just can't help but to compare just because of the name of movie. Basically the order of the movies is 1-3 with the first being the best and the latest entry the worst, I actually like the first two Annabelle movies more than the third Conjuring, but that's because those were more creepy and scary tone than this.

Besides, horror movies aren't completed with a few added jump scares.Not necessarily a scary movie but you have to follow the story to understand the plot twist. It's basically a demon summoned by a witch 's ritual to try and keep her soul intact with a deal or collateral, only it backfired.The only thing for me is that it lacked depth and the curse was broken so easily, so I couldn't figure out why the demon needed a soul to return when many died, or why the witch promised him one. Also, some characters missed development and we don't know where they came from and why they were there.It's based on a true story but the story plot is fabricated.

363,lmhale35601,Disappointing,4,17 June 2021,"Not good but not terrible. The first half hour was promising but then it got lame. It was kinda interesting that they took the storyline another direction instead of the typical haunted house type story though. But.. I watched the documentary about The Devil Made Me Do It and I saw how waaaay off the storyline was from the real story. The real story is far more interesting and I don't understand why the movie went in a different direction. To me, knowing that this stuff is real makes it scary, so why make up this whole story when the truth is what's freaking scary. I watched the movie again after watching the documentary and I actually got bored and cleaned my kitchen.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

365,WLRSky,Weakest Conjuring movie but still watchable,6,5 July 2021,"The first half of the movie wasn't that great. The dialogue and directing was boring / uninteresting. Some of the scares didn't even work and felt over-the-top. The fact that there are too much exposition scenes is also a weakness of the movie.However, the latter half of the film is much better. There are many interesting elements and scenes such as searching for a missing girl / communicating via a dead body. You actually start to care about the story and become curious about how the movie will end.The second half also includes some great visual / images. There are great shots and disturbing images featuring a ghost and monsters. The finale wasn't that 'scary' but it definitely wasn't boring either.In the end, it was clearly the weakest conjuring movie and I don't think I'll watch it twice.... But as a time-killing method the movie is worth watching and it has some good elements in it.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

I suppose it's worth watching as long as your expectations aren't that high. Basic film, basic script.....basically basic.

But this part is basically a much more suspense and a crime thriller so if you look at that way then the movie is great but when you look at the conjuring saga you imagine scarier scenes and demon thing but in this movie the humans who actually manipulating the demons.

I loved the first movie and thought the swim s one was a worthy sequel if not quite as strong. What this movie was lacking was a sense of dread and creepiness. It ain't Hereditary, that's for sure. Most annoying we're all the loud jump scares in this one. I also felt little emotion for the main characters this time around even though I like the actors. I think it has to do with a very heavy handed script. This for more like an episode of the Goosebump series.

375,kstice-25195,Lowest rated film of The Conjuring Universe,5,9 June 2021,"While most of IMDB concurs that The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It ranks as the worst film within The Conjuring trilogy, I would go one step further and state that it ranks as the worst film within The Conjuring universe. While the movie may still be mediocre and good for a few scares, it doesn't match the quality of previous installments. Depending on who you ask, most people would say that either Annabelle, The Nun, or The Curse of La Llorona is the worst movie within this universe. However, the quality of the characters and the frequency of scares in those movies is much higher than in this one. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are still fun to watch, but none of the new characters bring any likeable qualities to this film. Additionally, the film often goes 30+ minutes at a time without a quality scare. One may find this film enjoyable to watch once, but multiple viewings of it would not be necessary. 5/10.Pros and Cons:+Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are still a likeable duo+ A few good scares, particularly one with a cadaver+High quality soundtrack-The plot of the story is not very original or memorable-None of the new characters are likeable-Doesn't frighten the viewers as frequently as previous films in the universe.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

377,mildlymorbidx,Solid,7,6 June 2021,"I kinda go back and forth on this one. Visually a great movie. Pretty solid script. Im not familiar with all the cases from the Warens but this is supposed to be a popular one. The acting performances were very good. Even though the young boy had few lines I felt his reaction acting was great. The scares in this were mostly jumpscares. I felt they were limited in the last two films but this one I could see it coming a mile away. I also felt there were some extra ""dark"" images throughout the movie, more-so than the others. Was hoping for a liiiiitle more courtroom talk like exorcism of emily rose, but no. I do enjoy that each of these movies can stand alone and dont rely on each other. As Im watching I wonder how Vera and Patrick dont just fall in love with each other during filming as they convincingly play a pair completely in love.

Story and character is the reason why we care about the stakes-that's where drama, tension and horror comes from. If it was all jump scares and lacking in story (the movie Winchester comes to mind), I guarantee y'all would've been even more disappointed. But if that's your thing, you'll probably be just as entertained by a jack in the box. While remaining faithful to the Conjuring universe, I appreciated that this third movie explored new territory so it wasn't just a repeat. It is a quality addition to the series with good production value, and much more thoughtfully-written than the spin offs.

Whereas here, it was a total crutch. Each scene that had one, you could see how the entire scene was set up just to accommodate it. I thought it was gonna be more of an ""Exorcism of Emily Rose"" type of courtroom drama which would have been an interesting shift in platform, but that part of the story (the part sold to you in the previews) is almost non existent.To me, this franchise clearly has run out of ideas and running solely off popularity.

410,aequanimis,The movie equivalent of white bread.,3,10 June 2021,"God, this movie is so terribly bland.In terms of technical aspects, everything is average. Some camera shots are nice-looking in the way that most shots in movies are as long as the director uses a decent camera, but there was nothing that particularly stood out to me. The scares were your classic horror movie scares -- everything goes quiet while a character is looking intently at something and then suddenly gets loud when a rat scurries off or two girls walk by. The CGI is... okay. You can definitely tell when it's being used in a scene, but it's not laughably obvious. Soundtrack? Uhhh... It was there. There was this weird, out-of-place, actiony theme that played sometime in the middle of the movie that just really sucked. Everything else? Meh.The plot is okay. It's interesting enough to make you want to keep watching, but not enough that it kept my attention throughout. I kept checking my phone to see how much time had passed.What really drags this movie down is how wishy-washy it is with everything. The movie has a lot of great opportunities to create some creepy, unsettling lore or backstory, but it just decides to justify every single plot device with some vague explanation. Literally, the woman who is performing this curse or whatever is referred to as only the ""Occultist"" or the ""Satanist"". The ""satanists"" performed ""human sacrifice rituals"" that gave them ""power"". The ""Satanists"" worshipped ""Satan and his Demons"". They showed Arne's lawyer some unspecified thing that convinced her demonic possession was real. The Catholic church used this book to ""identify witchcraft"". It's all so awfully bland when just a little bit of extra detail or some extra research could have made the film's universe so much deeper and more involved for the audience. Also, some guy taps on a glass door and breaks it with his cane because the characters needed to get into this morgue and that's apparently the best and most rational way the writers of the movie thought they should do it.Additionally, the characters also suffer from the movie's laziness. Who is Debbie? She's Arne's girlfriend, and she helps with the dog boarding house. Who is Arne? Debbie's boyfriend, and he gets possessed. Who is Lorraine? Psychic woman who has visions. Etc., etc. All of the characters can only be described by what they do in the movie instead of who they actually are, disconnecting them from the audience completely. They're just vehicles for the plot, not an actual part of the film's universe.This combined with the forced, unoriginal dialogue create such a bland movie-watching experience. There's so much room for improvement that it's painful to watch this without pointing out all the ways it could have been better. I am very easily scared, so I will admit that the jump-scares did scare me. But I think that's the only good thing I think I can come out of this movie with.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

But the movie is not about the case per se, it is about the series of paranormal events that supposedly happen in parallel when Arne was in jail waiting for his trial.This movie is not as terrifying as the ones before, but it is good after all.

Yes.. please call 911 for me, I'm about to have a stroke due to the extreme IQ loss I experienced after watching this movie.. It was so bad. Nothing like the previous two. The entire movie simply happened, I didn't feel connected to any of them, the acting seemed so forced, everything was repetitive.. the jumpscares were really lame, with sudden high volume music to simply blast your ear to try to freak you out.. there were times that we did get flashes of the intense vibe of ""The conjuring"" universe, but it wasn't enough to save this movie.

423,jollyjumpup,"Good story & visuals, badly designed scares",5,29 July 2021,"There's no shortage of bad horror films out there, but it really sucks when one comes along that's almost great but is ruined by one major facet. In this case it's the soundtrack. The pieces are all there, it's how they're mixed that destroys any suspense and undermines the many potential scares written into the script.Whether the overwrought mix was the director's or the sound designer's idea, it's a horrible misfire. The dialog is mixed low, but at every possible opportunity for a jump scare it gets SUDDENLY EAR SPLITTING LOUD LIKE HERE'S WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO JUMP OUT OF YOUR SEAT!!It might make you jump the first time, then it just gets ANNOYING. If it worked, the visuals wouldn't matter - you could turn one of Andy Warhol's early navel-gazing epics into a ""horror film"" by constantly inserting LOUD NOISES here and there. Instead, the pattern gets obvious fast and the jump scares lose their effectiveness.Unfortunately these Mickey Mouse soundtracks are even worse on video than in the theatre. If you want to hear the dialog you risk blowing your speakers or waking the neighbors whenever a ""scare"" pops up, or else you have to ride the remote vigilantly.In this case it's especially sad because all the other production values are excellent, from the lighting, sets and costumes to the casting and acting. The music and sound efx are fine, it's just the horrendously unbalanced mix that brings it all down.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

They're still very much every horror fans couples goal!The mood has definitely changed from a slow menacing build up, to a faster paced set of action, but the Warrens have hit the 80's now so new decade, new vibe.Personally I think this has kept the franchise fresh, they haven't milked everything they can from the first two to come up with a third, but have kept all the key elements so this is still a continuation.I've knocked a couple of points off as the court case scenes weren't executed to well and are more a means to tie the plot together than anything.The sets, cast, fashions and even those slide show end credits with the real life 'v' cast members are all still there, it's all just done in a style a few degrees away from the original but Vera and Patrick fit these roles so well it is how the Warrens would react to all of it.Not sure if they can get away with yet another film after this, but I definitely think it would make it as a Netflix series - Ed and Lorraine could be the new Mulder and Scully.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Not to insult anyone on the creative side here but come on, the script and story is very childish.Character development was also basic to non-existent, actually you just don't care about anything that happens in this movie, you're not getting sucked in, it's not very scary (mostly because of all the stupid Christian explanations).

430,t-ktinney,Make it stop,2,8 June 2021,"I guess when a movie franchise makes money, studios will milk it for every last dime. That seems to be the deal with the Conjuring movies. This movie was so boring and so long and took forever to get anywhere. It also was a little hard to follow if you can believe that. It jumped all over and what eventually was a simple storyline (and a silly one) was made to appear complicated.I started fast forwarding in some parts because it just draaaaaaaaaaggggged. Nothing happened until the last 5 minutes. It's not scary either. At this point, we can all predict the jumps and scares, can't we? The characters are so annoying now and the idea that their love can ward off even the most evil spirits and forces that come at them (because we all know that stuff is real :-/) is eye rolling and I was hoping ""Ed"" would become possessed or something in this movie just to be more interesting. He's the ""demonologist"" but asked ""Lorraine"" several times ""so what do we do?"" ""What's the next step?"" Again, eye rolling.This movie just sucked.

431,luke-mori1986,Why change directors?? It doesn't work!,3,6 June 2021,"The first two films that James Wan directed were brilliant. Such an eerie atmosphere in both and they kept you on the edge of your seat wandering what's going to happen next. They make you feel like you're almost going through it too.Changing directors in my opinion doesn't work, it's like you can tell straight away that something is different. James Wan is needed to capture the same feelings and atmosphere that the previous two created. I had high hopes but knew before I'd seen it that it wouldn't be the same and I was right. It feels quite cheesy and cheap, extremely over exaggerated and very disappointing.It made me roll my eyes more than anything rather than the feeling I was hoping for where you are genuinely on edge watching it and excited for what's to come. If Wan directed this I know it would have been 10 times better. Changing directors is a bad idea, I don't understand why directors don't return to direct if they're involved in the writing and producing etc. It's like James Cameron being involved in the latest Terminator returning to write and produce but not direct. And surprise surprise it wasn't the same and failed to create the feelings and atmosphere that the first two he directed did. Same story here with The Conjuring 3. And the same for James Wan's Insidious, 1 and 2 were very good, changed directors for the others and they were crap.Sorry James Wan, I love ya but I don't love this film.

439,glennmeerten06,The Rise of Warren,6,20 June 2021,Part III of The Conjuring provides nothing new nor innovative. It instead offers predictable but real scares and is directed with a slick hand. It's the engaging and compelling relationship of the Warrens that saves this film from mediocrity though. It's what made the original and its sequel stand out amongst its peers and it certainly provides a much needed quality boost for this third outing. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are outstanding once again. The duo elevate the material to a compelling level. The Conjuring: The Devil made me do it is solid and nothing more. Maybe that's enough considering its director. A fan can only hope that James Wan will return for part IV. Even though part III isn't a disappointment.A discussion that might be important is on the subject matter of the film. Considering the case the Warrens lend their aid to isn't a family in crisis. It's rather a real-life murder case in which the Warrens come to the rescue of the offender. One might consider this in poor taste considering the film doesn't leave any mystery as to where it's morality lies.,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

The Conjuring 2 was good but not as good as the first, and The Conjuring 3 was probably on a par with 2. The Conjuring 3 overall is certainly worth a view, and I felt quite satisfied at the end, but the suspense could have been milked a bit more, and I felt that it needed the visceral creepiness of the first Conjuring.

Trailer does look good but the full picture is not that great.Not hating Michael Chaves, but the suspense isn't that great anymore. Maybe because there is no Lorraine Warren to consult with them, I am not sure but the suspense is not suspenseful anymore.Also, based on what I watch and how I understand the movie; It's somewhat like Dean Koontz' The Vision and Darkfall combined. If you haven't read those two books I can't explain the whole story here. I'll just give the stuff that, what I think, is the same in this film and the two books.The things that are the same are:
First, there is Voodoo stuff that does look the same as the Bocor in the Darkfall, Baba Lavelle, which does curses and rituals the same like Isla in this movie.Second, In this film Lorraine's clairvoyance works like how it works in The Visions' Mary Bergen's. They both almost got killed in the last part too; both Ed in this film and Max in The Vision got disabled by the Antagonist.Anyway, this film still has a good plot if, maybe, I haven't watched films or read books that do feel the same like this film.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

It's a tedious watch. The movie has no thrills or chills. The scare factor was missing. The movie goes nowhere. More the movie unfolds more disappointment it becomes. Movie itself doesn't make any sesnse. Without James Wan the movie was like earth without oxygen. The makers need to point out the mistakes and rectify it before the next one if there is any.

The Warrens as usual are great in this and like the prior 2 Conjuring's it looks nice and is acted accordingly. There's also a lot of the Warrens so that helps.Unfortunately though this one doesn't ever get to where either of the previous ones do in terms of frightening. The set-ups, scares and stakes just aren't as well executed and a few characters should've gotten more screen time in order to flesh out them and the plot. There are some cool effects and the plot's actually a strong point, but a horror movie should be scary and this one just isn't. Too much imagery, not enough tangible danger, too much mystery without ever fully going into it and too little horror to compensate.It's not bad but it feels more like a mystery-thriller than a horror and the plot probably called for the latter. Again it isn't bad, there are some really good scenes here and there and the acting's nice all around.

457,itzakkunwarak,This doesn't scares you BUT...,6,6 June 2021,"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do ItFirst of all, lack of James Wan as director is clearly seen in this third venture of The Conjuring series. This movie fails to sacre us like the earlier movies but this movie takes you on a ride in an epic storyline. This time this movie is not limited in a single house, it goes to city and the court too.It seemed as if, the goal of this movie was to focus on the Warrens and their investigation which is why it was less scary than the first two movies and this is where it fails. This looks like a detective movie where the detectives are searching for someone who is forcing innocents to kill other and make them commit suicide. This part doesn't even have a demon in it, well the antagonist of this movie is a human. Watching a horror movie where a human is the main antagonist and you don't even have a demonic character in the movie makes it less scary and this is where the movie fails.There were no unnecessary jump scares which is a positive point of the movie. Also, the background music is smooth and makes you feel the circumstances the characters are facing. Editing of the movie is very sharp.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren respectively are a treat to watch. We can see the fear, the anxiety in there face.Overall, if you are a Conjuring movies fan then you can go for it. Also, you don't need to watch the earlier Conjuring universe movies to understand this movie so if you are free then give this a try.My Rating.:- 3/5**",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
458,sethlong-67988,Way better than the first 2!,9,13 September 2021,"I hate to say it. The first Conjuring was not that good. There were hardly 3 or 4 scary scenes throughout the whole of the movie, and most of them went on for way longer than they should have. The kids were probably the worst aspect. All 5 of them were the same. They were very well acted, but there was nothing that set any of them apart from each other. They were all super stereotypical. The villain doesn't look scary at all, and there are no twists to the story. Everything happened at superficial face value. The beginning scene with Annabelle had nothing to do with the story whatsoever.Conjuring 2 was a big improvement. There were kids, but they were actually pretty distinguishable. Each one of them had a unique personality, and the movie even gave them a little arc, making them learn to stick together as a family and help their sister. A lot of the scarier scenes work because there's actual substance to them. In some scares, you even get to learn who the villain is. And you get to see it! Take that, Bathsheba! And the best part is without a doubt that the movie has a pleasant twist to it near the end.The beginning scene with the Nun actually had to do with the rest of the movie unlike the first one which just randomly shoved Annabelle into a scary scene with the Warrens' daughter for no reason.All of the Conjuring movies up to this point have been extremely wholesome. Compare that to a movie like Grave Encounters. That movie is the complete opposite of wholesome.They really have no point being R-rated as there is almost no gore, no swearing, and no nudity in the movies. Compare that to Insidious which is a PG-13 movie that has plenty of swearing in it.And now we arrive at The Conjuring 3! What's going on? People are getting murdered by a demon-possessed dude. Heck yes! There's blood and guts, there's people dying, there's Patrick Wilson going berserker with a sludge hammer!The best part: ONLY ONE KID! Now we don't need to deal with 5 mentally identical daughters. We just have one kid who is a side character throughout the whole movie. The story is freaking awesome. This evil witch lady is ""conjuring"" a spell that causes people to think that they're fighting an unholy being, but really, they're turning against their own friends and family. That's pretty cool! Arnie is very much a character you feel sorry for as well as his family who truly does love him. The Warrens are as good as ever, and Ed has a heart attack that makes him need to use a cane the whole time.Ed and Lorraine travel to this retired priest's house to get information, and they find out it's his daughter that's doing this. Then his daughter kills him, Ed is brainwashed into trying to kill Lorraine, and Lorraine tells Ed to remember the first time they met, and so he destroys the witch's desk and she crumples up and dies.Idk why people think that the movie has ""too much story."" The first Conjuring didn't have nearly enough. Conjuring 3 actually gives a well-crafted story and packs a few punching scares along the way.Gotta say, I didn't expect a movie from the guy who made La Llorrona to be this good.

The first 2 movies set a high bar for the 3rd installment. I was definitely expecting better. There is a few creepy or tense moments but more often I found myself feeling something I hadn't felt with the other movies. Boredom. 3/4 through I had to pause it to deal with something and I have yet to finish it a week later. I don't feel like I'm missing out. Honestly the real story this is based on is more interesting. If they had focused more on that, starting with the possession of the little boy and leading up to the murder by the sisters boyfriend months later it may have been better. Instead if feels more like a footnote tacked onto the fictional story of Lorraine battling a Satanist going around cursing people. We spent so little time with Arnie that I doubt anyone really cares about his struggles or whether he was facing the death penalty for his crime under the influence of a ""curse"".",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

469,cuprikov_pavel,Just a shame!!!,4,30 June 2021,"There will be spoilers in the Review! So, at the beginning of the film, they show us a boy who was possessed by a demon, then they show a guy who asks a demon to take possession of him, the demon agrees and goes into a new body, at the end of the film it turned out that it was not a demon but a curse, what nonsense, why does the curse look like an obsession ? And how can a curse pass from person to person if it does not have a mind like a demon, the curse works differently, it curses a specific person and does not pass from body to body as a living, spiritual being, that is, the director has no idea what an obsession is and what is a curse, or did he want to surprise? It looked stupid, there was no atmosphere of fear, I was not afraid, that is, even here the director does not understand how to build a terrible scene, he does not know how to scare, that is, he does not own the craft of horror! There is not even creepy music and screamers, in short, without Wan it's just rubbish, the same thing happened with the movie insidious, parts 3 and 4 were mediocre. Also, a pair of Warrens were pale shadows of themselves, before they complemented each other, Ed was brave and smart, knew how to perform an exorcism, Lorraine, in turn, was endowed with the gift of foresight, but in 3 parts everything is done by Lorraine, Ed is somewhere in the background, the villainess in general it is not clear why she does what she does, she talks about her soul, but she is a Satanist, her soul is already with the devil, how she tried to save herself, I did not understand, she works for the forces of evil, then that she will die a terrible death a question of time. I barely finished this shame, I watched at home in 4k, thank God I didn't go to the cinema and didn't give them my money, I didn't expect such a horse, it's better not to shoot the sequel without Wan because it will still be weaker !!!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

The atmosphere is fantastic, I recommend watching this late at night, with the lights off and no sounds outside of the television.Sound work was absolutely stunning, even when no music was playing. Scene set up was pretty decent, some stuff did feel a bit rushed, but it didn't really detract too much from the film overall.Really a different style than previous films, a bit more focused on the Warren's over the subjects, though it does maintain its charm that made the series beloved by horror fans worldwide.Definitely recommend watching in theaters if it's safe for you to go.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Having said that, this installment had the opportunity to create and tell any story they wanted, and then we all see that this is the one that they chose. Talk about underwhelming.I believe many of us can agree that among many other things, the distinct characteristic that made ""The Conjuring"" such an appealing horror film, was that it made you connect and feel sympathy towards those involved in the plot. Daytime horror, realistic reactions to unrealistic scenarios, etc. The sad truth is, you just don't feel that in this film.On top of the above let downs, this film feels so Hollywood it's unbearable at times. It's really no surprise to me why this film was made available on both streaming services and in theaters.

How to make a boring scary movie that is not scary at all.I am 44 years old so I probably shouldn't have watched this as it is obviously made for teenagers. But even though my favorite drug is political thrillers and mystery movies, I do enjoy films that are fundamentally different than my favorite styles. Silly comedies, animation films, super hero stuff..I don't expect every movie to be a serious masterpiece and I have a good time if a pop movie has flow and some laughs in it. Or some scary scenes. So I decided to sit down and watch it.My gosh.. Horror and thriller means suspense and scary scenes. This movie has nothing. Everything is predictable. You know from before that some demon is coming. And when he, or she, or it, finally arrives, there is nothing scary about it. A movie about exorcism has spinning twisted bodies. WOW! Now I am impressed! Meaning, too bad I am not impressed at all because since I saw the exorcist back in the 80's, I have seen possessed bodies twisting and producing cracking sounds in every other copycat movie since then.The plot is silly, the acting could do nothing to help this mess, and the scary parts of this movie are simply non existent. One scene inside a morgue had potential, but once the demon guy started running I almost pissed myself laughing. The excellent work by the make up artists, destroyed.I rate it with a 4 instead of a 0, simply because John Noble plays in it.Some teens will probably enjoy it, but those teens who are looking for a genuinely scary movie will probably rate it with a 3 and not a 4.I am seriously thinking about buying some copies just to burn them in my fireplace.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

The chemistry between Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga was really good if not better than the other films. I didn't like the villain of the movie I thought it was really dumb and made little sense.

was without a doubt on the the year's greatest expectation film of the year, but sadly it doesn't follow it up. Ed & Lorrain, are helping a young family exorcising a young boy who's possessed by evil spirits, but things escalates when the boy's sister's boyfriend, later on shows signs of the same evil possession. Despite a great acting the film is a huge disappointment, mostly because of a horrible script, one of the other reason it's not so good, is that the film doesn't have what the 1st and the 2nd film had.The loveable complexion that surrounded Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga in the two previous films is gone, they seems tired and fake in this one, and it's sad. The film is based on real life Warrens case of Trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, which occurred in the beginning of the 1980.The director of the film Michael Chavis don't seem to be able to deliver like James Wan has previously done, and it's shame.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

496,derlaninktown,Wasted potential,5,25 July 2021,"I love the first two Conjuring films. To me, they're the greatest masterpieces of horror of the last couple of decades. I enjoy the entire Conjuring universe, but admittedly the films outside of the original two films are very hit and miss. Annabelle: Creation is the best of that lot by far. Still, they are all enjoyable films overall.This film? I never thought I'd say this but I was disappointed in it. This is the first time a movie in the original series stumbles. Boy, does it stumble. While I enjoyed it, it's uneven at best because they set up some great things but dropped the ball on how they handled them. I put it on the same level as The Nun, and we all know how that one went. This film had both good and bad things going for it and I'll start with the good.First, it starts with what has to be one of the most effective sequences in the entire Conjuring universe. It actually sets up the film as a potentially terrifying movie experience. The exorcism of the boy causes Ed to have a heart attack, and he spends the rest of the movie recovering from it while investigating a dangerous case--a great set up. Second, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are very solid throughout the film. Yes, they've been playing these characters over the course of three films prior to this one (they appear in small roles in Annabelle Comes Home), but if you pay attention they put fresh spins to the characters in each film that actually work. The rest of the cast is all right as well. Not on their level of course, but they don't slum it. Third, the film does manage to briefly capture the atmosphere of the first two films from time to time, and doesn't rely on jump scares to the extent that the second film did. Fourth, it has a refreshing twist in that it isn't the traditional haunted house pic that the first two films are. It wasn't focused in one dwelling like they were. And finally, speaking of twists, it has an especially interesting one in that the main antagonist isn't a hostile ghost or demon that shows up to terrorize with their own agenda but a human threat in the occultist that summons a demon through a curse. It's an intriguing idea and a very different direction for the film with great potential.Now for the negative. And boy, are they doozies.First, the film is not directed by James Wan like the first two films were and does it ever show. Wan is an absolute master at establishing and maintaining a creepy, unsettling, and sinister atmosphere from the first frame to the final shot of a horror movie. The director of this film, Michael Chaves, has talent (the opening scene demonstrates that) but he just isn't as gifted as Wan when it comes to maintaining it for the entire film (maybe in time he will be, but he wasn't for this film). While the film does have some genuinely creepy and atmospheric moments I found that there was not one thing in it that actually could be considered scary. Every scare was predictable long before they occurred. When I saw the first two films I actually jumped at times but this film didn't scare me at all. I think it would have worked better if David F. Sandberg directed this, and I actually get the creeps when I think of what James Wan could have done. Second, the film does not live up to the opening sequence at all and kind of falls apart and becomes a mess once the title is displayed. The film just goes into a different direction and nothing in the film can hold a candle to that scene at all. The previous films actually made you think, but this one spells everything out too clearly for the viewer all the way through. Third, I mentioned Ed's heart attack in the opening sequence was a great setup, but it didn't add anything to the final product overall and they wasted a great plot device. The only thing that they tried to do to add tension to that plot device was have Ed forget to bring his medication at one point. He later forgets it again before the final battle but that ends with a twist anyone can see coming. He spends the entire film investigating a case while recovering from it and he exerts himself physically several times beyond a safe limit. Not to mention the considerable psychological stress he puts himself under and he comes out fine each time. This causes a problem in the final act (more on that in a moment). Fourth, the final battle doesn't even approach the level of the danger of the previous two films final confrontations. Like I mentioned, Ed's actions while recovering from his heart attack throughout the film undermined any kind of tension during their dealings with the occultist since you knew he'd be all right the entire time. Finally, I found that the occultist was never actually a threat. Her backstory came too late and they didn't develop her character to make her menacing enough to potentially come out on top in a confrontation with Ed and Lorraine. Admittedly it would be enormously difficult to establish a terrifying and menacing villain like the demon nun Valak of the second film and The Nun (she was the stuff of nightmares and in my opinion the most terrifying demon presented in any movie ever), but with a human villain against our heroes the final struggle should have been more of a challenge for them. Not once did I ever feel she was any kind of a match for the Warrens.In the end it's still better than the average horror film released these days and it's not bad for what it is. The film definitely suffers from the 'third film in a series' curse and the final result doesn't live up to the potential of the subject matter at all (one of the problems with The Curse of La Llorona, which has the same director). I won't recommend it, but then again I won't condemn it. Watch it and decide for yourself if you're interested. Or don't watch it if you aren't. In the end, it's up to you.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

499,seedoeatreview,The devil is in the details,7,4 June 2021,"I wonder if the studio executives at Warner Brothers knew that they had struck gold when The Conjuring was released way back in 2013. This worldwide phenomenal franchise is basically a license to print money and has produced such successful spin-off movies as Annabelle, The Nun, and The Curse of la Llorona. Since 2013 Warner Bros has kept this money machine going by releasing a Conjuring-related film every year, except for 2020, which is where The Conjuring 3: The Devil Made Me Do It comes into the frame. Originally scheduled for a September 2020 release, covid put a stop to all that before the franchise came back on track with this latest 'based on a true story' thriller which takes its premise from a real-life murder case from forty years ago.The year is 1981 and Ed and Lorraine Wilson (Patrick Wilson & Vera Farmiga) are helping with the exorcism of an 8-year-old boy (Julian Hilliard) in the small town of Brookfield, Connecticut. With the demon inside little David refusing to leave and causing havoc throughout Glatzel's family home, the boyfriend of older sister Debbie Glatzel (Sarah Catherine Hook) demands the evil spirit leave the boy's body and take him instead. What Arne Cheyenne Johnson (Ruairi O'Connor) doesn't realise though is that this demon will take over his body and ruin his entire life. This evil spirit possesses Arne to such an extent that he murders his landlord before leaving its host to face the full extent of the law. The Wilson's realise that Arne is not the one to blame here and, as the title suggests, the devil made him do it. But how will they prove this in a court of law and just how does a similar murder not far from Brookfield tie into Arne's defence?THE GOODWith the phrase 'the truth is stranger than fiction' the writers and director of The Conjuring 3 have used this real-life story and created a screenplay around it which, if you don't think about it too hard, is quite devilishly entertaining (pun intended)... in a sick and twisted kind of way. The original premise of the film, Arne being possessed, is fascinating, and hearing the actual audio of the exorcism (during the end credits) will send chills up your spine. Wilson and Farmiga know how to play their characters all too well and do a great job in portraying the serious nature of their business. It's just unfortunate, however, that the story does lose its way in the end.THE BADIt's all fine and good to keep this film grounded by basing it on a true story but it completely loses its way as well the audience, when ridiculous and quite frankly unbelievable events occur that take you right out of enjoying the film. If you have at least half a dozen witnesses watching someone levitate and smash out all the windows in a prison, wouldn't that somehow make it onto the news? Wouldn't you use these witnesses in your court case to defend your client? Apparently not, because once it was all over nobody spoke of it again. Conjuring 3 is a film that begins with an interesting and true-life story but which quickly descends into fictional utter nonsense and common horror tropes to pad out its two-hour running time.THE UGLYRule number one for creating a 'who done it' storyline must be to have all the characters in play so that the audience can stay enthralled in the film from start to finish. There's nothing worse than feeling cheated as an audience member but that's exactly how Conjuring 3 made me feel. I'd love to know if other audience members felt the same way after watching it!The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It was enjoyable enough to watch that I never got bored. Unfortunately, there weren't many scares to be had, and what starts off as an entertaining horror story transforms into a love story for some bizarre and unknown reason. Talking about it afterward with my movie buddy, the deeper you look into the storyline the more glaring plot holes arise. Strictly for horror and Conjuring fans only!THREE & A HALF EXORCISMS OUT OF FIVE.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

If we go to the side of the plot and the script, then the movie was able to present a good plot, but it was not the strongest side in the movie.The side of the main characters (Ed and Lauren, the first part is Ed and Lauren, the second part is Ed and Lauren, the third part) no thing new they are the same
Directing and shooting was very good and this is the only strong element in the movie

The previous Conjuring movies are better(By means Conjuring 1 and 2). The new mystery sort of investigation was okay its not bad. But the chills are not so scary like the previous.

'Why did you let this ordinary film be released?'My mum and I are huge fans of James Wan horror films. We have loved The Conjuring 1 & 2, Insidious 1 & 2 and Annabelle Creation very much. We were so excited that this film was releasing. When we watched it, the first 5 to 10 mins were superb and gripping. Soon after that it became a bore! No scares, no small children (children makes a lot of difference in horror films) and no scary faces.I believe James would have tried his best to make a difference if he was the director. He would have made it innovative and gripping adding scares and faces. Some other audiences slept while others were playing on their phones. Climax sucks. Only saving grace is patrick & vera.

The movie is very scary and engaging, it has jump scare, dark atmosphere and haunting background score. You will feel sorry for the character 'Arne' for inviting the demon into his body to save the 8 yr old boy. Also, scenes where he is traumatised by the witch are painful to watch. As for Ed and Lorraine, they both fight and investigate for the source of the curse with lots of horror and scares coming at their way !! I enjoyed the film very much and i found it very satisfying.

528,oulamies,A strong sequel held back by modern horror devices,7,2 July 2021,"The main item of concern for this third Conjuring installment was the lack of Jim Wan in the director's chair, now occupied by novice Michael Chaves. A glance at his resume was hardly encouraging, for yours truly anyway.But he didn't manage to ruin the film. The script is interesting to start with, finally addressing the actual practice of devil worship. I believe the film could've risen to the heights of the first two without an overabundance of today's horror sins: cheap jumpscares, too many computer generated scary-faces, headache-inducing music video editing.Chaves had the decency (or perhaps he was held at gunpoint) to keep the overall atmosphere fateful to the series, however. The key scenes rely on dark, eerie cinematography on some seriously terrifying set pieces, along with fine performances from pretty much the entire cast, Vera Farmiga once again stealing the show. I did have to watch most of the film through my fingers. Well worth seeing to creep yourself out.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

The movie was just okay, definitely not the best horror film I've seen but definitely not the worst. I thought the ""villain"" who was that one lady hanging in those underground tunnels could've been a lot scarier then just this woman with a normal toned voice and not that scary looking. It also almost put me to sleep multiple times because I just had no care for any of the characters.

532,JohnnyRatesALot,Possibly THE BEST Conjuring Film Yet!,10,30 May 2021,"I'm a huge fan of The Conjuring Universe, I absolutely love Ed and Lorraine Warren, and I love Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's heartwarming portrayal of them. I was so excited to see The Conjuring 3 at its prescreening - and it did not disappoint at all!At first I was skeptical since James Wan wasn't directing this time; however, he was still heavily involved as producer and story creator. While Wan didn't direct, that certainly didn't take away from this film's Conjuring-level quality that we all fell in love with from the first two films. So don't let that worry you. Wan successfully passed the baton over to Michael Chaves who did the film great justice. And, in my opinion, it's the best (and darkest) Conjuring film yet. And I never thought I'd say that after witnessing the first two films.The storyline and direction for The Conjuring 3 is very different this time around (which is a great thing, since the ""haunted house"" plot was bound to become repetitive). This time Ed and Lorraine aren't confined in a haunted house; they're on their biggest and most epic journey yet, venturing out in the public and doing everything they can to help prove a man (Arne Cheyenne Johnson) not guilty of murder by reason of demonic possession. And it isn't a simple task. In fact, it's their most difficult investigation yet - and it will lure you in.Overall the storyline is very unique and intriguing, the characters are very interesting (especially the franchise's brand new villain The Occultist), the scares are terrifying and creative, there's lots of suspense build up, Joseph Bishara yet again did a fantastic job creating a creepy soundtrack (my favorite of the three films, by the way!), Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's chemistry continues to shine more than ever, the acting is incredible, the film's familiar tone of good conquering evil is strong, there's lots of touching and emotional moments, and this case takes the viewers down a very dark path - possibly the darkest yet.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga both said The Conjuring 3 would be ""massive"", ""a doozy"", and ""the darkest Conjuring yet"". I wholeheartedly agree with their claims. This Conjuring is a different beast (pun intended) and is a fresh, well-needed installment for The Conjuring Universe. Ed and Lorraine's ""The Devil Made Me Do It"" case sets the franchise in a brand new, interesting direction.This film was definitely worth the long wait, and it definitely upholds the quality of the first two films while branching out new ideas of its own. I highly recommend you go see it in theaters upon its June 4th release date. Although it's going to be simultaneously released on HBO Max, The Conjuring 3 is a film one should experience on the big screen. Five stars!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

535,johnnythreeper,Not a good installment,5,11 October 2021,I don't blame the director. I don't blame the writer. It definitely took a team effort to mess this up. So far the conjuring universe has been driven by Valak and whatever (whoever) the hell Annabel is. This film doesn't seem to fit. This film seems more like a dollar store knockoff of The Conjuring.

So, there's no need to compare.The only thing that let me down was the comedy scenes, The first movies managed to strike a balance, but here we don't see it, the movie try to creat an atmosphere of seriousness, but it lost when I saw that the lawyer had to spend a night with Anabelle to believe in Devil's existence. (WTF????)This kind of scene doesn't look funny and break the seriousness of the atmosphere that they wanted you to feel.But I can easily say that this is so far better than any Conjuring Spin-off movies.The effects is amazing and the two exorcisms are one of the best of all the franchise (Better than the exorcism of the first movie for example)If you are a Conjuring fan and hated the lasts spin off movies, than you're gonna love this one.

550,lakicia,What a disappointment,2,8 June 2021,"The first Conjuring movie is probably my favorite scary movie of all time. The second one was good, so this one was such a disappointment to me.Poorly written. Little originality. Done-to-death possession scenes like backbends, levitation, priests staring at the house after exiting the car...etc. All that was missing was the green vomit. 🙄Confusing. It's as if 2 or 3 people had ideas about the plot, and they just married them all together.Unrealistic writing. Example- the beginning before his exorcism, would a kid really be asking some dude, ""When are you going to marry my sister""? And the part where Lorraine almost falls over the cliff, there's no way Ed could have stopped the demon from pulling her down when Ed didn't even have anything to hold onto. The momentum would've easily pulled him down with her. Just lazy writing.The ""climax"" was confusing.-Why'd Lorraine go to the old man's house alone?-I wasn't sure if the satanic lady was dead or alive, even after the old man's story.-Why'd the old man take the gun out?-Why didn't the satanic lady just kill Ed instead of blowing unexplained evil dust into his eyes? Weird.-Why did it take the lady so long to fulfull the curse? Just kill'em! Lol I'm so confused!The endings were cheesy (Pill in the locket, Detective visiting the cliff where the girl jumped, gazebo) Give me a break.2 stars for the 2 leads. Otherwise, what a disappointment.

553,joaovitorn-13727,They could've done much more with what they had,7,14 June 2021,"There is a very upsetting amount of wasted potential in this movie. For the first time, The Conjuring moved away from the haunted house formula and the Warrens had an ""adversary"" that - if they had done it right - would have been as ""skilled"" as they are (I'm trying to avoid spoilers). The acting was great as always and the antagonist was as creepier and more menacing than in the last movie, which in theory escalates the tension.The problems:
1. Movie was too short - should've been 2h30m long.2. Narrative focus shifts halfway through.3. Villain is introduced late in the movie.4. Scares were not as expertly crafted as in the other two installments.5. Villain is defeated too easily.6. We're not given time/backstory to make us care about the potential victims - other than the Warrens.

556,Umarfilmgeek,What do people want?,8,7 June 2021,"I watched this movie after reading a few reviews as I always do. Saw a lot of negativity regarding this third installment.Conjuring 3 explores a different type of haunting. It's not a typical haunted house or Possessed individual story.It's a storyline that delves deep into the relationship between our beloved protagonists Ed and Lorraine Warren.I've followed their works for many years through books, TV shows, interviews and articles and I liked how they portrayed their bond in this movie.But I digress. This movie isn't a romance, it's a horror. And many people say it's not scary. As a seasoned horror fanatic, not much scares me. As a person who knows a lot about the paranormal and has experienced evil black magic, I can tell those who are reading this that witchcraft, black magic and voodoo are very, VERY real.The fact that the demon showcased in this movie is so damn powerful, should be enough to intimidate most viewers. The scenes shown are scary because it shows how evil a human can be, to cause pain onto others. The possession scenes and demon scenes are scary also, as I've said previously, it shows how powerful that specific demon is.I went to the cinema with my brothers and my best friend, 4 of us in total, 4 huge horror fans who watch every horror movie together, and we all enjoyed it.I loved it. It was slightly different to the first two installments, but that's what people wanted. I saw many people who complained that they were sick of haunted house movies and wanted the third to be different... Well it is different and excellently executed.Is it the best it of the three?Hell no. But it's a strong film and a welcome addition to the conjuring universe.Watch it with an open mind and understand that witchcraft is a very real thing.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

559,samprivate-53704,The final nail in the coffin!,5,26 May 2021,"I will be honest... i never had any interest in the Conjuring Universe... The Annabelle films, The Nun, The Curse of La Llorna were all abysmal films in terms of production and storytelling. However, there was a splinter of light a dust of hope at the end of this dark narrow tunnel and that was Conjuring 1 and 2... Both these movies were amazing ""HORROR"" movies, they held you at the right ammount of suspense and thrill and had a decent running story with an amazing direction by Mr Wan... Then came Conjuring 3, as soon as i realised James Wan was replaced with the same guy that directed La Llrona, all alarms started going off, and it turns out, my fears came true. Conjuring 3 is one of the worst installment to this franchise that has no constructive storytelling, the pacing is all over the place, there are no scarey moments which is sad considering its a horror movie, the acting from the side cast is absolute abysmal, Vera and Patrick carried this movie on their shoulders only to be glossed over illogical scenes, terrible writing, and one of the worst villains in the franchise. Do not watch this film... there is my warning.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
560,tupkczavvn,As scary as slapping yourself in the face.,2,5 June 2021,"It is truly god awful. Bad directing, bad writing, bad editing and utterly incoherent. I knew I was in for a tough trip when an they recreate the iconic Exorcist poster art for some reason and then proceed to berate you with the loudest exorcism ever. It's what you would imagine a low-effort, early 00s edgy remake of The Exorcist would play out. The Conjuring: Way Too Long of a Subtitle isn't just the weakest Conjuring, but it is not even in the same ballpark as the first Annabelle, let along the actual Conjuring movies. The only entry I can say, with confidence, is worse is The Nun. Even the Conjurverse's bread and butter, jump scares, all fall completely flat and you will see them coming miles away. Annabelle lived and died by jump scares, but at least all of those landed effectively. I always thought the Conjurverse was a mixed bag, but I never thought the second worst of the entire shared universe would end up being a mainline entry. I'm not even trying to be a contrarian. I was all for a lesser-but-fun sequel, giving a new director a chance to flex his skills. This was worse than La Llorona. At least that mess had a sufficient scary spirit/entity. This has none of that. This has no real demon or supernatural entity. It's just SOME LADY trying to piss off her dad. Even the lovable Warrens only marginally improve this movie, and poor Patrick and Vera look insanely bored. The Warren characters will derp around on 3 different investigations that barely connect while having more pressing issues. The characters have no development. You will not care or even fully be aware of what's happening. It'a just a lot of loud nonsense that legitimizes ridiculous legal defenses like demonic possession. No, a real person was murdered. The whole thing is a technically and morally bankrupt garbage fire. If you must watch, do it on HBOmax and then watch something that isn't terrible immediately after. Don't go to a theater to see it, even if you're over the pandemic scare. Watch it in your living room so you don't disturb the other patrons when you laugh at the horrific writing, dialogue and complete lack of sense for the 50th time.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

One review said ""tO MuCh STOrY"" okay love but the story was average at best , boring, dull and the scares was none existent. Not like the previous two especially the first one the story was first class and the scares was also top notch. I generously give this a 6 but if I could it would be a 5.5.

562,hfiyxniu,Where is the prison hospital security camera footage?!?!!,2,5 June 2021,"Wtf was that?? I wanted to watch a horror movie not a cheesy unoriginal love story, it's the 3rd movie, we know they are married & in love, we get it.There was nothing scary in the movie, the waterbed scene had such promise (although clearly pulled from nightmare on elm street) I was waiting for a big jump scare only to get a lame montage of candles & big cups. This was not a horror movie it was a romance about 2 people who happen to be involved in the ""horror"" world. All of the scenes involving the exorcisms were predictable & cliche, nothing original at all.My biggest question is where were all the witnesses from the prison who saw this man snap his metal handcuffs, break all his bones, contort his body in inhuman ways, create a giant wind storm, break all the windows then finish by levitating in the air while trying to kill himself?? Did the prison not have any security cameras in the hospital wing where an inmate was being held on suicide watch? Why wasn't any of that shown in court? Seems like he would have had a pretty solid case!! And if the demonic stuff didn't play in court & the jury didn't believe it then how did he only end up getting 5 years?? 5 years for a cold blooded murder with overwhelming evidence?? After which he apparently lived happily ever after with his girlfriend ...",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

But this part didn't care about the souls, but the part demonic touched and cursed
The movie was considered ""20 percent horror"" for me, and the rest is crime, thriller, and mystery
And I can say that the director ""Michael Chaves"" learned from his mistakes in the movie ""The Curse of la Llorona""

570,bb74,Heavily influenced by 1973's The Exorcist,10,7 June 2021,"The 2013 film was tame. The 2016 film was a major improvement. The new, 2021 film is probably the darkest film of the three, and takes the series to new heights as well as pushes the Warrens to new challenges unlike any they have faced. While I am still undecided whether I enjoyed the 2021 film over the 2016 film, I can comfortably say that this film kept one's interest, engagement, and was intriguing all throughout the film, similarly to how 2002's The Ring effectively accomplished.On a side note, one thing I can appreciate about these films are the homage they pay to the 1970's and 1980's - one being the music - which is something this 1990's + generation needs to be exposed to in our modern horror films. 😁👏👍
This new, 2021 film would not have been made possible without the impact and the influence of the 1973 The Exorcist film. Many horror films tend to lose their impact over time, and there were clearly many influences from the 1973 film present here.10/10.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

The beginning is what you expect from exorcisms: demonic voices, scratching, body contortions, and a lot of screaming from family members. With Conjuring 3, we also delve into the romances between Lorraine and Ed, as well as two other characters. While I understand the reason, it distracts you from the point of the movie. In the other two, you know Ed and Lorraine have a strong connection.The second half of the movie is just the same, with more jump-scares and a lot more body contortions and demonic possession.If you're wanting to be scared, you might be let down.

578,colinrfricke,Why Fix what isn't broken??,5,13 June 2021,"This third movie in the series was just ok. The director attempted to move the story away from the typical haunted house storyline of the previous two films. The problem is that the first couple films were very much liked so why deviate? True there needs to be some variety but most of these hauntings have enough variety to satisfy that.The beginning scene is the best as it is the climax scene in a typical Conjuring movie, the exorcism. The film then devolves into satanic curses and flashy special effects while Ed and Lorraine investigate the source. In the end there is a small step between the sublime and the ridiculous and this film takes that step big time. They made the same error with the Conjuring 2 where the end scene with the lightning and the tree windows bursting would put to rest any question of demonic possession. This film goes even further with levitating and exploding windows and helicopters around.Still the movie has some redeeming qualities. The special effects are good and the investigation, while choppy and navigating without a compass at times, is still intriguing. The scares are less but they are still there. This would be a good horror movie standalone but as a Conjuring movie it is weaker.The most disappointing part is that the ""true"" story (depends if you believe in this stuff) would have made for a good movie. The documentary from Discovery ""A Haunting"" covered this case and it was a very good episode when I saw it.In the end it is worth your time but it is a weak link in the series.

For me this film is clearly a classic theme of exorcism, just like the two previous editions - and there is also nothing to argue about - that the fact is that until now, no film can beat The Exorcism (1973) as a pioneer of this theme.Luckily, I am very used to watching horror films with various themes, so 'The Conjuring 3: The Devil Made Me Do It' for me is still a good and quality film from all sides, no doubt. And this third edition is more focused on a occultism, a side that is rarely made into a good horror film and also has audio and visual quality. This film is the answer. Three editions of The Conjuring have their own characteristics, and this third is much better than the second edition (for me). Few ghost sightings, lots supernatural!This film will be very easy to enjoy for those who like horror themes such as: Supernatural, Dark Arts, Witches, Occult, Satan Worshipers, and the like.And for those of you who want the terrible terror of the ghosts?

With the Warrens looking to save a man on death row after supposedly killing an individual while possessed by a demon. Without going into spoilers the plot shakes things up a bit from the previous two films with the likes of Satanic cults and more or a detective style approach.I personally would of loved to see more of a focus on the court side of the case and the reaction of the defendants plea, it would of been a really refreshing direction for this film but what we get still isn't bad.The Warrens are still great in this film with both Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga having a real chemistry on screen and still being one of the most lovable protagonists in horror media in a long time.However with all this said, I believe this 'horror' film does fail in one department, and that is in its scares.It's a shame to say as I believe the previous two instalments had some unique moments of terror.Whereas in this film most moments are so easily telegraphed to an obvious jumpscare that you can see a mile away, or more unique set pieces unfortunately spoilt by the trailers.With all that said, this is still a decent sequel, just not the terrifying sequel I had hoped for!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

I was questionable about how well a third movie with the same kind of story line might play out but I couldn't have been more wrong.The Conjuring 3: The Devil Made Me Do It flips the original format on its head and keeps it fresh. It takes place in various locations with various victims and villains and the addition of the court case really kept it interesting.As a horror movie fanatic I give a lot of credit to the first The Conjuring movie as one of the best modern day horrors and this one has matched if not surpassed it.The filming is beautiful with amazing shots and although there are some jump scares, it doesn't rely on them to make the movie unsettling and scary.The Conjuring remains one of the best modern horror franchises out there.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

But the plot became really confusing and I didn't think it was explained very well. The ending wasn't that fulfilling.I really was anticipating this movie during the entire pandemic and I still enjoyed the movie as entertainment. The cinematography was really nice, especially in the third act. But ultimately, the scares were far and few in between and weren't that shocking. I think the audience pretty much knew when each scare was about to come.Nevertheless, I still enjoy the Conjuring universe overall and I think it is a enjoyable addition. It is always great to see the fine performances from Wilson and Farmiga, but I left this movie feeling a bit cold and not desiring to revisit it again. I hope others enjoyed it more than I did!

This movie do the exact opposite with cheap jump scares. If you are looking for a a scary movie this is really not what you are looking for. However if you are looking for a horror with a great story you have come to the right place. While the horror of the film is very basic and not scary at all the story is great. I really loved the pace and the overall feeling of the film with the exceptions of the jump scares.The cinematography was very good and the music and sound was also excellent.I would recommend this to anyone that loved the stories of the previous installments of The conjuring but just remember this is not a James Wan movie.

Even a ""here's some objective info, decide for yourself"" approach would have potentially been more frightening.As it is, the Conjuring franchise's historically inaccurate obsession with women murdered by their neighbors centuries ago in the name of collective delusion is pretty disturbing but the masturbatory myopia around their take on those events makes for some of the best comedy available in horror.Granted, if you believe in this particular vein of mythology, you might be spooked. They really do their best to make delusion reality.But if you don't subscribe to fantasy, this is almost on comedy par with the early Evil Dead franchise. Do yourself a favor and enjoy the tropes, the expected suspension of belief, and general irrational chaos that is this film.Oh, and you'll even get the obligatory Exorcist cameo in the beginning!

But of course it works only, because of the great Script. The Script is great and it made these movies so special.The movie had a nice start and a good ending.The middle part was ok, but a movie needs this part to work (and it has to be ok, to normalize the atmosphere a bit).I could think about watching this movie again, but on a bluray (lets wait) .

I expected a solid character development, exploring the story of the main character just like the trailer, jumpscares and a scary horror scene. But i didn't found any of these here. Even this movie was lack of jumpscares and ""demonic"" scenes.There's a lot of plot hole which i think they actually can make the storyline better than this. Arne johnson who should be the ""center"" of this movie, didn't stand out at all. The title ""devil made me do it"" just gone wrong because they ended up did not focus on him. The opening scene was promising, but the ending was not. Also they always using the same resolution and ending just like the previous movies. It's not bad, but seems very cliche and predictable.But overall, i still gave a pretty good score because i liked the cinematography and the actors. The actors did well and really understand their assignment, but the execution and storyline ruined at all.

I've spent two hours in a lot worse ways, and I always enjoy movie theater popcorn.First, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are great actors, are always entertaining to watch, and make a good cinema couple. Any resemblance between their personalities and relationship and those of the Warrens is most likely pure fiction, but that's Hollywood for you, right?As for the story - it's a change from poking around haunted venues, since it gets us into the courtroom. I haven't read the trial transcript, so I don't know how closely the movie sticks to the reality, but I suspect there's a lot of literary license being used to keep the story moving along. I won't say it's a stellar courtroom drama, but when your defense is literally ""the devil made me do it,"" you're in for a tough slog. I did find myself hoping that SOMEBODY would absorb the demon and then throw themselves down a flight of stairs, a la ""Exorcist,"" but alas - I was disappointed. Would have livened things up a bit.I write this as someone who is convinced that the Warrens hit on a very successful con years ago, and managed to maintain it for over half a century, so I wasn't expecting to be convinced that actual demons run around possessing humans (or Raggedy Ann dolls, for that matter).

It was different in that black magic/occult elements were introduced in this instead of the usual evil entity/spirit. I wish they would have done more with it and tied it in to what we have seen from the other conjuring universe movies. It wasn't as dark/scary and don't expect jump scares. It was more mystery with some horror and a small bit of a love story. They should have taken the conjuring name off of the movie and just made the title The Devil Made me Do it from the Conjuring series or even The Devil Made me Do it from the Warren Files. They could have kept it separate from the conjuring and made it like a spin off of the other type of cases the Warren's have taken on. That way expectations wouldn't be so high.

Over 90 minutes it manages to drag on more than both previous Conjuring films, which were actually over two hours long!We don't like The Conjuring because of the Warren love story. They are the narrators who frame each case. The protagonists are the characters that make up the stories, but in this film we never really get to know them Instead, we are treated to ludicrous, over-the-top special effects, even though the allure of these stories is based on subtlety and ""what if"" moments.

All that hype about this being the scariest part of the franchise is a blatant LIE, spread by people who made the film and knew it was crap, so they wanted to make sure the viewers were interested in parting with their money by making false claims. The truth is that this film can't even compete with all those Annabelle extensions, let alone the previous parts of The Conjuring (and I loved The Nun!).I found myself losing my focus more than a few times, so I had to stop the video and do something else instead, before coming back with a hope that things would get interesting at some point. They never did. What I got instead was more cheesiness and boredom.The satanic witch was a great character, which is the only reason I give this dull film four stars. I think the actress who played her was brilliant, and I wish the story was more about her and her motivations.No scares and no atmosphere of horror to speak of.In conclusion, I couldn't stop thinking about the real story this was based on, where some guy, they claimed was possessed, killed a man and, basically, got away with it (manslaughter, yeah, right...), which is also not something that normally happens to me when I watch The Conjuring films.

I really like The Conjuring series and find them really scary, with great stories and actors. But not this one. The story is generic, leaves alot unexplained and doesn't have the same heart to it, that the others have. I just don't feel for anyone other then Ed and Lorraine, and that's only because of the great actors.Having a human as the villain, instead of a demon in the forefront like the other movies, is the biggest mistanke in my opinion. That woman is not scary. I know a demon is behind all this, but we almost never see it.I don't think being thrown into a posession scene from the very beginning was a good choice either, cause we as viewers have no relationship with the characters yet. We've also seen all of this before. Nothing new or interesting was shown. Bodies twisting, blood splashing from taps, dead bodies coming alive, wind blowing and furniture flying. All of this is old news in horror movies, and it takes more to make a great one. These things only work if the movie is tense, the story has heart and we care about the people experincing it.

However, I believe the average joe confuses intentional scares with scary.The moments that stay with me from excellent horror films are not the jumps, the boogeyman faces, the screams or the gore - but the feeling of dread that cuts right to your core.The Conjuring series has always managed to maintain this value - and the third film is no different.The reason I give it an 8, is because even with a different director at the helm, James Wan stayed on as a writer, making his presence known through the classic one-take, use of shadows and absence of sound we've come to know and love from this series.The Conjuring 3 shows us that it can deviate from the haunted house story but maintain it's quality - and in my personal opinion - improve upon it's own formula.It feels like the most cinematic film for sure, with tighter direction coupled with higher production value. But this isn't just a case of ""more money, bigger film"" - they've really honed in on the details and nuances and it was just such a delicious experience.I'd say the decision story wise was a fresh take, yet it did lead to an overall ever-so-slightly slower feel at times, however this is more than made up for by what this film does right.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

If you want to have a great horror movie the production needs to go way down. Make it creepier by doing less.

699,onekingprods-54469,Should've Just Told the Actual Story...,5,6 June 2021,"The problem with this film was the writing. The actual story told in the book (and in the Kevin Bacon TV movie, ""The Demon Murder Case"") is quite creepy and stands on its own. If they had just told the story like in ""The Demon Murder Case"", but with the caliber of acting and production value of a ""Conjuring"" film, this movie could've really been something.Unfortunately, they decided to go a completely different way in this film and it doesn't work. The backstory of witches and totems just convolutes the strength of this story which is the love Arne has for David, and all the creepy elements of David falling prey to the burnt man known as ""the beast.""Act 1 should've been letting us get to know Arne and the Glatzels and seeing the heartbreaking progression of the ""the beast"" invading the lives of David and his family, culminating in the demon leaving David and entering Arne.Act 2 should've been seeing Arne gradually being overtaken by ""the beast"", culminating in his murder of Bruno. Seeing moments of Arne behaving ""animal-like"" like the book describes, could've been very effective.Act 3 should've been the efforts of the Warrens to make the case for demonic possession in court, complete with flashbacks to some of the more harrowing moments of David and Arne's possession, and the difficulties the Warrens faced when trying to get the Catholic church to approve an exorcism.While I agree that Wan is a stronger director than Chaves, the director simply wasn't the problem, here. Even in the hands of Wan, this movie would still be a misfire because of the direction they went with the story. Honestly, I would recommend reading the book, ""The Devil in Connecticut"" or going to Youtube and watching The Demon Murder Case. You'll see exactly what I'm talking about, and I'm sure you'll share my frustration about what COULD have been, with this film. Oh well...",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

I agree that Wan is a master at the job by this point, and for sure - most scenes doesn't have the magic touch we're used to.That bring said, everything else about this movie is so perfect that it doesn't need it! And furthermore, so perfect that it's even better than 1 and 2 - and that's without «Wan's magic touch». (Except for the ending, which is «just» great and not perfect).The depth of this movie is far greater than it's predecessors. Think about it, in the previous conjuring films you have the family in need, the warrens, and a love story - and they explore those.With this movie, you can never guess what's next. There is constant tension, and a strong feeling of urgency. The writing and some of the one liners is just too good!The Conjuring is about the true cases of the Warrens, and they have done much more than help a family home haunting. They are the main characters in these movies, so ofcourse we'll get the narrative from their perspective.The film has several great twists, in which none of them are predictable.

I don't think that a 6.4 is fair, it's probably because of bad marks coming from braindead fans.That being said, one thing I really disliked about the movie is the absence of a true villain (like the ghosts in the 1st movie and The Nun in the 2nd one). The villain in this one appears in the last 30 minutes and it just creates no interest.Still, the movie is pretty good.

715,hettichsjulian,"Great Opening, interesting Story ideas",6,2 July 2021,"Good:
I must say the opening was great. Very well shot, a good first jumpscare and probably the best beginning in any of the Conjuring Universe installments.The fact that the Villain this time is an actual human was interesting as well. Another classic haunted house horror movie would have been boring.I've enjoyed the non linear Story and the Crime thriller influences, it was different and felt quite refreshing.Bad:
But, it's still the least scary installment out of the whole trilogy. A whole subplot was completely unnecessary and 30 solid minutes less would have been a boon.Another huge problem were the jumpscares for me. There were too many and like in the curse of la Llorona the were not very good. Just loud noises that made you jump, but immidiately left you disappointed.James Wan always managed to scare you a few seconds later then you would expect it.The characters were flat too. This guy who murdered someone was the classic, handsome good boy everyone likes, without any flaws or interesting trademarks.The character depth is comparible to a short film. The missing investment in all the characters made me not care a lot for them. This took a lot of the tension, at the latest by the end of the second act.And last but not least missing consequences. The Conjuring franchise has one trademark, it's that no major character dies. It's quite annoying that the film acts like Loraine could possibly be killed by Ed. Something I right away knew was not going to happen. But this whole scene, which could otherwise have been quite powerful, loses all its impact.And they are doing this again and again the whole movie. Probably the most annoying thing about the whole movie.But all in all it's still entertaining and I recommend watching it anyway. It's not the usual Hollywood Horror, it's different. And therefore I like it besides all its predictability and disappointing scares.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

723,deluquijulia,Solid Opinion,7,15 July 2021,"Back when The Conjuring hit the big screen in 2013, I thought James Wan directed one of the better mainstream horror films in years. I then thought that The Conjuring 2 was possibly even superior, so naturally, I was excited about a third instalment. Now available in theatres and at home, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is an average film overall, with some very solid moments. Something just felt off about it. Easily the weakest of the trilogy, here's why I think you can skip this one. The film opens with a scene that could've easily been the climax of one of the other films. I was shocked to see it start so quickly. It opens with David, a possessed little boy, as Ed and Lorraine Warren are once again investigating a possible curse. Arne, David's older brother, wishes the curse to take him over instead. Fully listening to that request, the demon latches itself onto Arne and makes things much worse. Ed in recovery after this incident, Lorraine becomes more of the focal point of the story here. If it wasn't for their presence, this film would've felt like just another average possession story. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson have always been the best part of all three of these films, but there was a great story to back them up as well. This time around, too many little details were happening during this case. This in turn made the film feel a little jumbled to me. It never felt like it was going anywhere until the end. This may have been one of their biggest cases in reality, but I don't think it worked as a movie all that well. That's not to say it's a bad film, it's just that it lacked the look and feel of the previous two. James Wan did a fantastic job directing the first two films and while I believe that Michael Chaves did a solid job here, especially with a few very well-done scenes in the forest and hallways, it just felt like it had a completely different feel. On top of that, writer David Leslie Johnson has also been hit-or-miss for me throughout his career. I really believe it comes down to who he works with on each project. Other than The Conjuring 2 and Aquaman, I haven't liked any of his previous screenplays. I think he's a very talented writer, given the right support. Overall, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It suffers from a look and tone that doesn't feel as authentic as the last two films. Ed and Lorraine are both great again here and they share some terrific scenes together, but again, I didn't care too much because the story happening around them wasn't all that compelling. There was too much trying to be said here and I think feel that the film suffers as a result. If you're a massive fan of this franchise (even the spin-offs like The Nun or Annabelle) then you might get a kick out of this one too, but I just thought this film was a huge step down in comparison. On its own, it's a fine horror flick, but that's not the standard that the last two set. I'll give the movie a pass for having some impressive scenes, but the overall movie is very, very average.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

726,cocosamar,Not my Conjuring,1,5 June 2021,I was waiting for this movie! The first two Conjuring movies were great and I think it was one of the best horror movies.

727,rosemarrym,Wan would have done in better,6,6 June 2021,"Was disappointed, not scary, just a timeline of events. It wasn't bad it was okay, and comparing it with the previous two it wasn't that good. Jump scares were predictable, the lighting was too dark in the scenes it was too annoying to watch and focus.

728,miaeli,"Not that scary, more of a movie explaining why the scary happens",7,19 June 2021,"I don't like watching scary movies because you gain nothing from the movie except be scared. This movie is not that scary, it has a predictable scare, but the movie is more focused on explaining why the scary happens rather than just simply scare you with the unexplainable. In simple terms, someone is possessed, a couple (The Warrens) finds out it's because of a curse, so they go in search of why someone is doing this curse and who the person doing the curse is. Apparently this movie was based on a true story; web search for Ed and Lorraine Warren as well as Arne Johnson.POTENTIAL SPOILERS:
The Warrens goes to visit a priest that studies the occult. They ask him, ""What I don't understand is why? Why would someone target this family?"". The priest explains, ""The ""why"" is irrelevant. The ""why"" is counter to everything that the Satanist stands for. His sole aim is chaos. His nectar is despair."" This to me means the person doing the curse is doing it to get chaos and is powered by the despair it brings. That's your why.Towards the end of the movie, we find out the curse needs 3 victims to be complete. The child, the lover, and the body of God to represent Purity, Love, and Faith. That is why you see the child get possessed first and than David (the loving boyfriend) was next.SPOILER: the person doing the curse is the secret daughter of the priest (the one that studies the Occult for some years) whom the Warrens consulted for reference. The priest said his studies influenced his daughter to become obsessed in that area. Now we know who did it and why.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
729,cherrygolden-56849,DISAPPOINTING!!!,6,22 June 2021,"This movie didn't do justice to the name of the Conjuring franchise. Storytelling, directing,editing everything was so poorly done!!!The moment i realised it was just some human made curse by some random old lady with no particular reason....i lost all of my interests to watch the movie!!! I just couldn't feel the fear ,the antagonist had no strong background story!! I mean what was the reason behind her doing this?? Why did she chose the victims? What was the connection between the victims??? I want to know. This whole thing was executed so weakly.The jumpscares were really predictable, some of them were laugh-worthy. And the thing that actually made me laugh was when they showed something like love won over devil or something...really?????The only strong point was the acting by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. These two carried the whole movie.I'm rating this movie 6/10 because of the acting by the main characters, the exorcism scene in the beginning which i actually enjoyed and maybe some tiny little moments where i wasn't bored.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

I didnt really feel a connection to any of the characters or even the story as a whole so even though i wanted to see what happened in the end i just didn't care about anything or anyone in this movie.

731,roraon,Consistent,9,17 August 2021,It is one franchise that keeps up with its reputation.

732,dar_k_ling,The Ed and Lorraine Show,10,1 June 2021,"Saw this last night at a preview screening, and for fans of the Conjuring franchise will not be disappointed. Visually, this addition was very dark; think Batman (1989). With the previous two Conjuring movies, and Annabelle Comes Home, Ed and Lorraine were secondary characters, so it was refreshing to see them be the central focus in this movie. It was also great seeing so many different locations, as the previous two movies were primarily set in either the haunted house or the Warren's home, which made the third instalment more fast paced. Patrick and Vera were incredible as always, and the supporting cast were equally great. Can't wait to see it again!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
733,ctankutmil,Not worth time,5,8 June 2021,"I had high hopes as I loved the series but unfortunately it was a huge disappointment for me or any horror genre fans to spend time for it. It falls short to scare and story was boring too. They should havr decided what to use as an antogonist, demon or witch. Using both of them or just not putting enough focus on one of them slows the story and script doesnt seem to improve the situation either. Most characters seemed out of reality and exorcism scene was nothing about the original exorcism rituals which we have seen on so many movies so far. You can watch it if you like and if you have too much spare time but it is only home video film in its current state, not a weekend movie to watch in theatre.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

738,philipdustson,Patrick Wilson & Vera Farmiga are Fantastic,8,6 June 2021,"Patrick Wilson & Vera Farmiga once again bring their acting 'A-Game' to this consistently engaging franchise (referring to the 'Conjuring' films proper, not necessarily the endless spin-offs).This third chapter really puts the Warrens front-&-center, and it's all the better for it.As usual, the acting duo inject 'awards-caliber' craft into their portrayals of the married couple/ Demonologists. Wilson & Farmiga really deserve the lion's share of the credit for being the heart-&-soul of these movies.They humanize the Warrens so expertly. They leave all the controversy surrounding the couple in-real-life 'at the door', and they play the Warrens as genuine 3-dimensional characters. If horror films of this nature weren't so looked-down upon by the industry, Oscar nominations would usually be handed out for the type of performance work they are doing here.This third chapter plays out like a detective-procedural thriller and/or dark actioner (a cool pivot for the series imo) - it shows that these 'Conjuring' movies (similar to, say, the Marvel Cinematic Universe) are somewhat mailable in regards to genre.Hell, I'd be game for a movie that was mostly a Romantic-Drama, centering on Wilson & Farmiga's Warrens (with the paranormal activity toned way down).Minor criticisms: it's not the scariest entry; and the 'final exorcism' scene in these entries are starting to feel a tad obligatory (as opposed to integral to the story).However this is a finely crafted 'B-Movie' with A+ budget & performances, made with heart.Of note: The cinematography & attention to early 1980s period details really add to an immersive, fun film experience.Also - Even with James Wan stepping down from the camera for this entry, I still found the aesthetic, and the overall 'feel' of the film, very much 'of-apiece' with first two 'Conjurings'.3 1/2 stars (***1/2) out of 5 (*****)",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

I fell asleep the first time watching it and had to power through a second attempt and was left underwhelmed to say the least. Cheap jump scared and a hard to believe storyline ended in utter disappointment.

744,davidaffleck-35343,Solid entry!,7,4 June 2021,"The third installment into The Conjuring universe is another solid entry! Great acting and storyline, Chaves has done a really good job with the continuation of this franchise without killing it, which is how I feel some of the other spin offs from The Conjuring universe have gone down, especially the nun. Its nicely directed, it has some good jump scares and creepy moments, however this is definitely the weakest in terms of horror and provoking anxiety out of the 3 in my opinion, and I believe that is just what you get if you lose Wan as a director. But the movie was still fun and I enjoyed it. It has enough to make you keep watching and not get bored.I would be more than happy if a 4th movie follows, as there is enough good here to warrent(pun intended) a continuation of the franchise.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
745,LSUK,An above average addition to the Conjuring universe!,8,27 May 2021,"After watching this I can safely say this is one of the better Conjuring movies. The quality was definitely above average compared to other Conjuring movies. The first exorcism scene alone had some amazing camera-work, effects and acting.It felt like the creators were a tad more aggressive with the scenes in this movie. Some of the characters get thrown around a lot more which does help make it feel a lot more authentic. Special mention to Julian Hilliard (who plays David) - he definitely has some pretty physical scenes and he did very well to make them feel authentic. Great bit of acting on his part!The story in this movie felt very polished and was portrayed well. It felt a lot more story-driven compared to other Conjuring movies, and had more depth compared to others too. The horror elements are the usual Conjruing-esque jumpscares with the occasional creepy and eerie scene which definitely grabs your attention. I must say though the effects used to show the exorcisms looked amazing. The body contortions were very well done and really creeped me out!Overall, an above-average addition to the Conjuring universe. Acting is great as always and a well thought out story really gave them the space to shine. No out of this world scares or anything like that (it's a Conjuring movie so you know what you're in for) but definitely worth a watch in my opinion!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

750,andrelarios,"A not so successful attempt to renovate an almost decade old franchise, but kudos for trying",7,5 June 2021,"In most of the comments on this page, where nuance seems to have taken a time off, this latest Conjuring entry is either the best horror pic ever made or a reason for banishing the producers from living in society. It is actually neither here nor there and the truth of the matter is, as always, much more complex than that. But if you're really just looking to be entertained for almost two hours, The Devil Made Me Do It will certainly do the trick.First of all, I have to admit that I really enjoy this franchise as a whole and the main trilogy is undoubtedly amongst the best contemporary horror movies to ever grace our screens. While the spin offs are very reasonably controversial regarding quality, it is not a stretch to say that this universe is yet to deliver a bad film, which is remarkable given the very sad moment that the genre is going through. This is why I was looking forward to the Warren's return and I must admit not feeling disappointed while the credits were rolling - in fact, I was admired by what this movie tried to accomplish.Being the first movie of the trilogy to not be directed by James Wan naturally brought about some changes to the formula. In fact, the script in itself (co-written by Wan) contributed to departing Devil from its previous installments, which is a nice attempt to stir things up (added to the fact that is really admirable when a franchise doesn't always play safe, like I dunno, most of the things Hollywood produces nowadays). Devil does not present the haunted house cliché once again and tries (not so successfully, it is true) to approach witchcraft, police procedurals and courtroom drama. That is, at least, what this movie's trailers try to sell you, which made me feel a little upset because I just love courtroom dramas and it would have been a nice addition to an almost decade old horror franchise if they just explored it more in this film, but that is just fine. Michael Chaves' direction is risk-free and even plain unoriginal at times. There are almost no jump scares and the scene which will most likely make you feel scared is at the very beginning of the movie. While watching, I guessed that he wasn't a veteren in the genre and yup, this is only his second feature film so give the guy a break. So we're left with a conservative direction and a somewhat daring script (albeit full of conveniences and no-ends), which is pretty much my attempt to summarize this movie.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are very comfortable in their respective roles and I agree with people here saying that they are the highlight of this film. No doubt Ed and Lorraine will make it into some people's relationship goals (including mine) and that is saying something about the charisma of these characters. I really miss the Nun, though. This new villain (played by Eugenie Bondurant) didn't really do it for me. The rest of the cast is funcional, with a special mention to John Noble for bringing to life a compelling and enigmatic character such as Kastner.Alas, you probably won't be left down by The Devil Made Me Do It, but it definitely serves as a yellow flag for this franchise. That means: either be successful at attempting to renovate the formula next time around or risk falling into ostracism. For this movie's risk taking, I will give it a 7, which in my rating's book is: good.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

The conjuring 3 was scary as hell, despite lots of people saying this wasn't as scary as the other instalments. But i really enjoyed this one, it did have a different feel to the other two, likely because it wasn't set mainly in one house, but that didn't shy away from the fact that this still brought the terror that the previous instalments had. There was a different director to james wan which i thought would be a let down but this one really made it feel like there was no difference.There was a human antagonist for the third movie whereas there was a demonic spirit for the other two, but this woman was a terrifying cultist who sent chills down my spine whenever she was on screen.People compare the movie to its realism to the actual case which isn't an accurate depiction.

754,cmoskito,"Weaker entry in the trilogy, needs Wan's touch",6,3 June 2021,"This is a solid movie. Scares are OK, fairly by the book for a horror film. Michael Chaves has really stepped up from The Curse of La Llorona. The directing is good at time, there are a few really well crafted scares. The biggest drawback of this movie is the plot. While the story is constrained somewhat by the actual Devil Made Me Do It case, it drags a lot. James Wan had a way of taking ""real"" case files and doing something interesting with them, while Michael Chaves isn't quite there yet.Performances are fine, nothing to write home about, but no one really breaks immersion. The directing isn't bad per se, there are some really cool sequences (although some of the better ones are spoiled by the trailer). This movie is just decent. It doesn't entirely feel like a Conjuring movie without James Wan taking the lead. I rate it a 6/10, not because it's a terrible movie, but because it just doesn't stand up to the first two, and missed my expectations.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

772,joe-collins91,Nail biting suspense and in-your-faces scares makes this a worthy sequel,8,26 May 2021,"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is the third entry in The Conjuring film series (and the 8th part of The Conjuring Universe): Helmed by Michael Chaves, who directed The Curse of La Llorona (an earlier and less well-received spinoff). James Wan is a co-writer and executive producer for the first time so no doubt many critics will be keeping a keen eye on Chaves as he takes the series in a new direction.The story is based on the case of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, a young man who murdered his landlord and claimed that demonic forces made him commit the act. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson return as ghost-hunting supremes Ed and Lorraine Warren who set out to make sense of the case and prove that demons can and do in fact take possession of people whilst convincing the high court that supernatural forces can be used as mitigating circumstances.The formula for the third entry moves away from the haunted house tropes that drove the narrative of the first two films and veers towards the possession court room drama/crime investigation and witchcraft theme and as such the film feels fresh (how many more times do we really want to see Ed and Lorraine poke around old and dusty houses?). Wilson and Farmiga prove once again that their presence is what makes these films so enjoyable and watchable. Amongst the jump scares and deafening score they offer substance and an element of humanity that really makes you root for their characters. This time around we learn even more about the Warrens, how they met and how these cases affect them on a physical and emotional level. Farmiga as Lorraine Warren in particular is put through the wringer and takes centre stage. A phenomenal performer who can act her way out of a paper bag, she offers one of the best character drives in the series.After a particularly intense opening scene involving the exorcism of a young boy (with nods and throwbacks to William Peter Blatty's original Exorcist) complete with some body horror that would have Cronenberg wincing the story moves along swiftly onto the case of Johnson who believes that a demon is responsible for the downward spiral his life has taken. The same demon is alleged to have caused the possession of the young brother of his girlfriend and so Ed and Lorraine Warren are drafted in to solve the mystery. The set pieces are what you'd expect from The Conjuring universe, with the camera panning away in some dark and dimly lit basement or morgue before a big reveal that hits you square in the face like a crescendo. Unlike Chaves previous effort this one comes with greater care for the scares, with the tension mounted up to extreme lengths and therefore the payoff feel earned. The central performances also add a layer of craftsmanship which makes up for the cheapness of some of the earlier spinoff entries. Ruairi O'Connor gives a moody performance as Johnson and really captures the sense of dread and unnerving unknowing that befalls a character that faces a life behind bars if the burden of proof is not challenged. Alongside genre greats such as Wilson and Farmiga he more than carries the film when required to do so. The score from Joseph Bishara (who penned the score for both Conjuring films and Wan's other ghost spinner Insidious) is a powerhouse of orchestral greatness, with shrieking violins coming to life when the scares are meant to catch you off guard. The ingredients all form together to deliver yet another fantastic Conjuring film.If I had to give some criticism then the ending is a little slapdash and the resolve is a little sloppy and the final antagonist isn't particularly scary, however by that point most people will be entirely entertained so you are likely to still come away smiling (or screaming).",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
773,cs1077,A decent effort in a new direction,6,6 June 2021,"Glad to see them take the storyline in a new direction. That was something fresh to watch in the conjuring universe.

I loved how it took a different angle from the others. Only marked one star down because I feel there could have been more story and character backstory of the culprit and original victim.,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
777,lvaughnt323,"No James Wan, No fun.",1,9 June 2021,"I'm a huge horror fan, and I LOVE the first two Conjuring films. They are painstakingly crafted by the masterful Director James Wan. So when I saw the trailer for the Conjuring 3: The Devil Made Me Do It, I immediately knew something was amiss - and that's when I saw this movie would be the first in the series not directed by him. Instead it was directed by Michael Chaves... the guy that directed... The Curse of La Llorana (2019). That was a HUGE red flag for me, but I gave this movie a chance anyway. AND to my surprise I kind of enjoyed it; it was so bad from beginning to end, I actually had a little fun.First and foremost, I respect Michael Chaves for being a little more reserved with his jump scares than the typical Hollywood film - unfortunately, he forgot to add in anything scary or original... or worth watching.If you like smart and relatable characters, then this isn't your movie. There's a character whose only purpose in this film is to be so annoying that when they die, the audience isn't too heartbroken. The character only exists as a plot device - and so does many other characters. Characters just disappear from the movie once their job in the plot is done.There's one part in the movie where the music used in a transition is so inappropriate it ruins the tone of the scene. It's so ridiculously tone deaf and sudden that I was literally in shock. That said, it's so bad it's hilarious and it's honestly the best part of the movie.This film is full of terrible CGI possessions and an absurd amount of bone cracking sound effects that have no consequences to the characters or their bodies. They just walk it off like it's nothing. None of it is scary.An accurate summary of the movie: Redundant establishing shots / predictable scares / a bunch of non-sensical bs exposition / characters and plot that I don't warrant any investment.This movie is so by the numbers and safe it's offensive. This is what happens when Hollywood disrespects the craft of filmmaking for that almighty dollar and I hated every bit of it.I wish I could give it a 0.Watch if you don't care about horror and have a few hours to waste away.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
778,feridpasha,Lowest in the franchise,5,21 July 2021,"Well, i love Vera and Patrick, but the whole thing is was on a low level compared to the other films.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
779,ashzombola,The devil made no-one do anything.,5,17 September 2021,"From the moment this film started I knew it was going to be bad. A priest, wearing a wide brimmed hat stares up at a house at night with a possessed child inside. I literally said out loud: why don't you just add a street lamp too?"" ...oh look they did. Ripping off the most well known film about demonic possession (in the world!) in the first 30 seconds is not good. It's not paying it homage. It is only not only not the best start, but total Plagiarism. It's not even done well enough for it to be obvious, or different enough to be original. It's just bad. We're then treated to rushed opening scenes which are to set the tone of the whole movie, apparently about the forces of evil... but to be completely honest, are more like 'the evil dead'. Seriously I was waiting for moose heads on the wall to start laughing. Evil Dead is awesome, but this is not a horror comedy film series.It's not scary, it's not fun, if it tries to do what came before it, it obviously missed what builds horror in a scene - tension, patience. It just rushes through everything yet manages to be slow and boring at the same time. The shots are weird, the editing is bad and the story is a complete mess. Unlike all the other films, there's no real demonic antagonist, just a woman - who we know nothing about, know nothing of who she is, or why she's doing anything. She's just a 'Satanist'. Oooooh scary. Don't get me wrong, I love a good film about satanic cults, but this isn't one of them. It also has absolutely no relevance to the original case. If there's one solid there we throughout all of these movies, it's the supernatural. It is supposed to be a supernatural horror. Did you hear that director? Supernatural. Having a human as the main evil in a supernatural franchise is horrifying alright, just not in the way intended.There's no real protagonist either. Ed and Lorraine look like they don't know what they're doing there. It feels more like one of those spin off adverts or talk show skits with A-list celebrities trying to be their characters in front of an audience without the environment they were created in. They just become parodies of themselves. It's not even worth the bad film watch to have a nice 'catch up' with these well loved characters. Vera Farmiga looks like she's actually high, all the way through. Even the make up is bad. There's one scene where she's waiting for Ed to wake up in hospital and she;s supposed to look like she hasn't slept, but she looks like how a child would describe it. It's honestly laughable.The main person this story is centered around; Arne Johnson is only actually in it at the start and the end of the film, we care nothing about him. The film diverts half way through to a completely fabricated case just to give this story some more oomph about two more people we don't care about and add a real bad 'cliff hanger' special effect... literally, for no reason whatsoever. It's honestly insulting to Arne case.At times it felt more like I was watching a really long episode of the X files... which was good... for a TV show... 30 years ago. I never have expectations for any sequels but what I do have is expectations for basic film making in 2021. This is seriously amateur. And not in a 'The Nun' way, which just tries to throw everything at once and fail on all counts, but in a 'have you even seen a movie before?' Way.Oh they also overly use this contortionist special effect for basically everyone when they're possessed... or angry... or ...hell I don't care. It's annoying. To say this entire film is essentially around possessing a soul, it's ironic then that the film has none. That's it's real flaw, it just has no soul. And the devil did not make anyone do it. The end.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

However, the story establishment is decent and the acting is good, especially Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga is great as usual.The runtime is considered long for a horror, but there are still some part of the story is not told clearly, therefore some viewers may get lost.Overall, the film shouldn't be considered bad, it's just not as good as expected, since it has been highly anticipated.Please make sure the 4th instalment is coming and get Wan back to directing.

I also really like the fact that they changed the story up instead of another haunted house movie. Hoping for a fourth!,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

838,BillyJessup,"Worst of the 3, But That Doesn't Mean 'Skip It'",7,28 June 2021,"There have already been a ton of reviews that go in depth, so I won't rehash what they've said.Overall rating: 6.5/10 (for comparison, I would say 1 and 2 are around 8.5ish).Biggest issues I walked away with were:1 - as others have mentioned, that camerawork is so shaky and cuts to so many different angles during the intro. Thankfully, they didn't do that the whole movie.2 - how is Lorraine now all of a sudden talking to Ed while she is in that alternate trance state? In previous movies he would start yelling for her to come back and then ask what she saw/what happened. How now is she giving him a play-by-play? Didn't make any sense. Total lack of continuity.3 - If Ed really did have a heart attack during the exorcism of David, given the way the rest of the script played out, I think it would have been better to just ignore that and let the history buffs grovel about it. Meaning: he goes from almost dead to wheelchair to cane to then running through woods/diving to pull Lorraine back up off the cliff, and then not long after that he is slamming a sledgehammer all over the place?? There was no purpose to include the heart attack parts at all. They added nothing to the story that whole miraculous recovery just came off like the writers didn't even care if it was completely illogical (which it was).Overall, still worth seeing but there are certainly some very large gaps in this one that just come off as sloppy and shoddy writing.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Whoever's choice it was to do that should be sacked as it reminded you of other superior films.After a year of lock downs this was the first film I saw in the cinema and I'm so hugely disappointed! It was beyond predictable and was never at any point scary! I laughed plenty. How on earth they can still get away with the ""based on a true story"" scenario is beyond me. Save your money. Do not waste your time!There hasn't been a decent horror in quite some time and I pray someone comes along that has the balls to remember that less is more.

However, I want to express my opinion about this movie's main antagonist.In every Conjuring universe movie, the main antagonist always was a demon or evil spirit. Thus, I was excited to learn that this time we have a person who is Satanist and use demons. Unfortunately for me, this also was the biggest letdown in this movie. This Satanist has no motivation for her actions except just being evil. If a demon is just evil, it is okay. This formula worked in every Conjuring universe movie. However now it just created a boring antagonist without motivation or any clue why she is doing what she is doing. Even more, it so easy to fix this issue. E.g., she made a deal with a devil/demon because she wants to resurrect her dead mother, child, husband etc. But the audience never got any explanation why she is doing anything in this movie.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

I thought this was going to be the most terrifying one yet because of the devil being mentioned in the title. Although the story was interesting, the script however was not.

But this film, for anyone researching the case is an insult to the victim....both Arne Johnson's victim, Alan Bono, and the allegedly possessed boy, David Glatzel, and his family.However, even worse than that was the stilted script, which was rehashed, cliched-exorcism speak, crossed with way too much theological infusion. I felt quite bad for Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson for the words of faux piety they had to continually utter. And who knew that this was really just the Warren's love story, after all?Virtually every scare in this movie was delivered by way of Jump Scare. You could literally predict when it was going to happen.Dramatic tension? Nah. Just a feeling of sadness that a man's murder was used for exploitation. While they may have taken part in the murder defense in 1981, almost nothing else shown in this film ever seemed to occur. Even the number of stabs was changed from 5 to 22, to put forth a theory, involving another alleged killing, that never apparently happened in real life, but was used as a prime plot device in this film.Disappointing.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

But now we introduce a super dated and toxic view of ""Satanism"" and witchcraft in a way that barely makes sense. The scares are pretty predictable and cheap, it would greatly benefit from practical effects. LESS IS MORE. I don't dig the heavy handed *love is stronger* concept either. We get it, you want us to believe Ed and Lorraine had a strong, otherworldly connection to each other that enabled them to fight evil powers. Okay. Is this an ad for marriage?

878,kaustav-54301,Just ok!!! More story without scares. Its really disappointing,6,18 June 2021,"Back when The Conjuring hit the big screen in 2013, I thought James Wan directed one of the better mainstream horror films in years. I then thought that The Conjuring 2 was possibly even superior, so naturally, I was excited about a third instalment. Now available in theatres and at home, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is an average film overall, with some very solid moments. Something just felt off about it. Easily the weakest of the trilogy, here's why I think you can skip this one. The film opens with a scene that could've easily been the climax of one of the other films. I was shocked to see it start so quickly. It opens with David, a possessed little boy, as Ed and Lorraine Warren are once again investigating a possible curse. Arne, David's older brother, wishes the curse to take him over instead. Fully listening to that request, the demon latches itself onto Arne and makes things much worse. Ed in recovery after this incident, Lorraine becomes more of the focal point of the story here. If it wasn't for their presence, this film would've felt like just another average possession story. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson have always been the best part of all three of these films, but there was a great story to back them up as well. This time around, too many little details were happening during this case. This in turn made the film feel a little jumbled to me. It never felt like it was going anywhere until the end. This may have been one of their biggest cases in reality, but I don't think it worked as a movie all that well. That's not to say it's a bad film, it's just that it lacked the look and feel of the previous two. James Wan did a fantastic job directing the first two films and while I believe that Michael Chaves did a solid job here, especially with a few very well-done scenes in the forest and hallways, it just felt like it had a completely different feel. On top of that, writer David Leslie Johnson has also been hit-or-miss for me throughout his career. I really believe it comes down to who he works with on each project. Other than The Conjuring 2 and Aquaman, I haven't liked any of his previous screenplays. I think he's a very talented writer, given the right support. Overall, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It suffers from a look and tone that doesn't feel as authentic as the last two films. Ed and Lorraine are both great again here and they share some terrific scenes together, but again, I didn't care too much because the story happening around them wasn't all that compelling. There was too much trying to be said here and I think feel that the film suffers as a result. If you're a massive fan of this franchise (even the spin-offs like The Nun or Annabelle) then you might get a kick out of this one too, but I just thought this film was a huge step down in comparison. On its own, it's a fine horror flick, but that's not the standard that the last two set. Overall movie is very, very average.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
879,CasualReviewer2021,"Different Director, Different Type of Conjuring Film",3,9 June 2021,"I enjoyed The Conjuring 1 and 2, directed by James Wan. This film is directed by Michael Chaves. Compared to Wan's films, this one was very weak. The script was lazy, the horror elements were disappointing, and there was virtually no character development. This film did not attempt to tell an interesting story with interesting characters.The Conjuring series has been successful because of its storytelling element. It reminds you of substantive, scary stories you would hear around a campfire. ""There once was a woman who lived in an old house. She began to hear a noise at night..."" Those kinds of stories. The one's that peak your interest and immerse you in someone else's fear. The Conjuring 2 did this brilliantly by setting the stage for the viewer. You learned about the mother and her family. You learned about the children and their challenges. As you began to get comfortable with the family, things start to change and you begin to feel unsettled. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It skips all of this and introduces you to characters you will not get to know, or care about.The horror element is also seriously lacking in this film. In the Conjuring 2, we learned about the connection with the spirit inhabiting the house and the house itself. There were reasons the spirit tormented the children There was also a story that unfolded with the Warrens. In The Devil Made Me Do It, the horror element was not effective because the audience did not care about any of the characters. The antagonist in this film was very disappointing with no interesting story. There was no mystery to solve, because the audience was not given a chance to speculate. There were no interesting clues or foreshadowing for the audience. Things ""just happened"" in front of the audience, which made the story flat and emotionless.It appears the director intended on developing more on the Warrens' story as a couple, but this aspect was very shallow. There were scenes where we received glimpses into the Warrens' relationship when they first met, but these glimpses totaled probably 90 seconds overall.Overall, this film does not deliver the quality we've come to expect from the Conjuring films.

I think the casting has been excellent--I like Wilson and Farmiga a lot as Ed and Lorraine.I've enjoyed all of the Conjuring movies, but this one is the best of them all so far! Sure, it's a Hollywoodized version of the true story, but that's always going to happen. Still, it's well done and has wide appeal, even for those who don't already know about the Warrens and their decades of investigations. Also, I noticed during the credits that David Glatzel and another Glatzel (ddn't catch the first name) were listed as being involved in the movie as well. Sorry, I can't remember what it said exactly, but it was some sort of consultant role. I like that people that were involved in the actual events had a hand in the making of this movie.I hope they make many more movies based on the Warren's investigations.

889,rajnishgupta-81980,Not a great movie but it's easy to watch.,5,9 June 2021,It's a okay movie. The main problem is that the movie focused too much on mystery and lacked in horror aspect. It also doesn't have many jump scares.,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
890,mohammadonayssi-86880,A disappointment!,4,5 June 2021,Wan's absence was really felt in this movie! As it was such a disgrace not only to the franchise (the conjuring movies I mean excluding the spin-offs) but to the whole horror genre! We're in 2021 and we still see a rat coming out of a cereal box for god's sake!

I really like horror movies but I don't really like the jump scare. For me, jump scares made me not really understanding the story. The jump scares make my brain putting me on a ""steady"" state (like, keep on guessing when is the jump scares) and not focusing on the storyline.That's why I love this one. The jump scares not too much so I can understand the storyline.Well that's for me..*why I give 9 instead of 10 is because when the devil possessed someone until the bones broken, that person will be dead tho...*But overall I love it.

902,earthseasged-62707,Thr weakest link in the series by far,6,5 June 2021,"Not scary at all, and just average. The thing with this story is that though based on a true it had no strong plot point there was no 'why' if this had been scary i might have overlooked a lack of why. And the writers tried to get around this by the old priest answering Lorraine Warrens exact question of why is this happening. Top be told that the why is unimportant thre ignorethat thing is to stop it. Hmm no i.. n the real world that's true, you can't change what you know, but it's a movie wth a star middle and ending. So of you're not going to explain why these people are getting cursed, you better scare me so much I don't care. Because I do care... to the point I got bored and started doing 'mystery science theater 3000 adlibs over it. (I was in my house so no one in thre theater was bothered) this movie ita very easy to make fun of. Im really sad im a huge fan of the conjuring/Annabelle/ nun world. And the old man practically had a catacombs under his little red barn house. The fit might have had a small set of underground rooms in the real story, but this was overkill. And you v bright back the young camera guy from thre first movie s and you didn't use him at all. Like a paragraph total over the whole movie maybe. At thre end they shove im thre real stuff with thre movie stuff and you see some footage/ photo of a tv spiraling endlessly within each next picture., type deal. It seemed like they needed the young Camera guy just to drop the camera to recreate that one shot. It was boring mostly and at the end when the Warrens placed their found artifact in the room. We all assumed it would be the skull totems. But all didn't expect the chalice. Not complaining, just surprised. Did really like the waterbed scene that was cool. The giant chubby corpse genie like it wad pulled from another movie that I can't quite place because I don't care enough to really try ac's remember.

903,kaylaek-22333,Not like the others,8,6 June 2021,I really enjoyed this Conjuring film. My husband enjoyed it as well and did not care for the others. It is different from the others. There aren't so many corny jump scares. I did enjoy the other films but this one is my new favorite in the series. The storyline in my opinion is better. I liked that the horror was not a cheesy and other have been. Others may not like it for that reason. I would definitely recommend giving this one a chance!,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
904,andrewmarzocca,not bad but nothing like 1&2,6,5 June 2021,"If you're watching and you've never seen any of the other movies in the conjuring series, it's pretty decent. Good story, good acting. It is definitely not a horror movie though. It's a mystery thriller.This movie does not feel at all like a conjuring film should. It wasn't even slightly conventionally scary. Directors/writers these days really struggle to make a genuinely unnerving, suspenseful, and frightening horror film. It's not impossible. The correct formula is out there. There are plenty of great horror films. This is just not one of them. I would have loved to of seen the original conjuring directer directing this one because i feel his taste is just what this series thrives off of.I would give it a 5.5 but i can't so i will give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a 6.Like i said not horrible by any means.

909,benimations-81751,Just plain mystery,3,13 June 2021,They kind of reduced the scariness and tension we feel when we watch a Conjuring movie. Because this one is different it's just mystery. They were hyping up the fact that they want to take the warrens out from a haunted house and connect it with something they investigated and that's the worst part in the movies for me. I love James idea but when this came it's like he barely made effort to make it feel it was really a movie he helped make. The story didn't feel believable or based in a true story anymore. They just made the Conjuring universe away from what it's all about. That's the very disappointing part. They made references of different movies which is not really my favourite thing because they just agreed with it. I think this will affect fans of conjurverse because of this.,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

914,daisymuk,Good cinematically but fails as a horror movie,9,6 June 2021,"As an avid fan of horror movies and in particular the conjuring movies I loved this film but I shouldn't have really. However.....it almost goes against the grain of the conjuring films. If I didn't enjoy it so much as a movie I would not be happy because it's a strange instalment to end a franchise on. The first movie based on a case of cursed possession it still contains the razzle dazzle and cinematic exaggeration of the Warren's experiences but almost completely devoid of wan's prophetic fallacy that made me and millions of others such fond fans of the conjuring franchise. It's a horror film that isn't scary. It's abandonment of horro movie cliches that are heavily relied on in the first two films is a theme throughout which makes it almost more of a thriller movie than anything. For a film which has come out essentially 8 months late it felt rushed and unfinished. The narrative was missing essential scenes but held up well, the characters could have been better established but did the job, the writing was surprisingly good and it was shot fantastically. Very ring-esque in its grounding in Both camps of horror and thriller which I absolutely love but I have to feel like it misses the mark as a pure horror movie.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

I started seeing this loss of direction these films had. Conjuring 1 and 2 are by far the best out of the series and the Conjuring 3 can take the realm of pushing these movies in the right direction. Is it the best? No of course not, but we gotta a lot more story for the Warrens and the writing was pretty good. I actually implore, that they trade in the overused jump scares, they might not be the scariest of jump scares but you watch a demonic movie at 3:15 am like I did and the whole movie is bone chilling. All in all this is everything I'd want in the ever expanding Conjuring universe and I'd be interested in learning or maybe seeing another adaptation of the Demon in the film. I don't think we ever learned the name or knew much about it and it had me quite curious to see more of this soul taking Demon.

920,JW1ngman,Beyond disappointed,1,4 June 2021,"It takes a lot for me to go out of my way to review something. Usually this is for positive reviews but my viewing of The Conjuring : The Devil Made Me Do It made me decide to leave this review.This movie is an absolute travesty on what is otherwise a decent horror franchise. Although the spin-offs in Annabelle and The Nun are noticeably weaker, the main Conjuring series have consisted of strong horror movies with an interesting and engaging plot, great characters and decent scares.This most recent edition was mind-numbing from start to finish. It felt like every horror movie I've watched before. Nothing new came and even moments where I thought the plot would go in a fun, interesting direction left me disappointed as the movie went back to tired tropes used a thousand times before. The plot is the most sleep-inducing of the series and none of the characters are interesting or compelling enough to hold any interest for the duration of the movie.The main antagonist is likely the worst I've seen in any movie for a long time. The writing surrounding this character is atrocious and it honestly feels like they put about one minute worth of effort into developing an interesting adversary for our protagonists.For a series that prides itself on providing a fresh take on scares in the horror genre this movie was a snooze-fest. Each 'scare' was laughably predictable and provided no tension throughout the entirety of the film. The previous two Conjuring movies had plenty if original moments that created fun, interesting scares but The Devil Made Me Do It doesn't even try to come up with anything new or scary. The scares felt like a 3-year-old jumping out from behind the curtain and saying 'boo'.The trailer clearly had the only interesting parts of the movie since nothing in the movie surprised or entertained me in anyway. Again, the plot could have gone in many different ways and have been a large improvement but we got more standard, cliches that show the writers and directors didn't know where they were going or how to end the movie.Overall I am very disappointed in this movie and I honestly can't believe that this film is still getting decent reviews. Just because prior movies did well and were enjoyable does not mean this movie should get a free pass. I wanted this film to do so much more but if you've seen any horror movie before, you've already seen this one.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
921,Deep_2050,Supernatural meets Conjuring,7,5 June 2021,This movie is more like a supernatural episode where they solve a crime . Just keep in mind that the horror element is less in this movie .Its a good movie and you will like it.,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
922,alishamccaig-33007,Least scary out of series but worth a watch,6,6 June 2021,I'm a big conjuring fan and to me this one did not live up to the last two - w number 2 being my fav - still worth a watch but wait till it comes out to watch it.Most jump scares in the trailer.The cult aspect was cool but maybe in its own spin off I rather hear any other demonic possession instead of it being summoned.If this was its own show I would say 7/8 but in the conjuring series it's definitely the least fav!Actors did very welll!!James wan we miss you!!,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
923,Aro13,What is this?,1,7 June 2021,"""Based on a true story"" should be taken with a grain of salt. It's as much as based a true story as if you were to read any crime story, and insert the defense pleads innocent due to demonic possession.This movie is all over the place. The tone is definitely not a horror movie. Though they try to remind you it is in fact a horror movie, every 15 minutes or so. With obvious jump scares, or replica shots of previous horror movies. They may be paying homage to those actual horror films, but this is about as much horror you get in this film.It starts off with a little kid possessed, flipping out. They call a priest, who arrives (insert replica shot of exorcist) and says let's get this kid to the church... But older sisters boyfriend asks the demon to possess him instead, and then everything is fine. He just sits down.Later he's hanging out with his landlord or friend who is hammered drunk who keeps trying to dance with him. Girlfriend walks in and says knock it off, drama, drama, drama. Stab, stab, stab. Homeboy kills drunk dude, goes to jail/mental health facility and says I don't remember I was possessed.Ed and Lorraine show up and say, he IS TOTALLY POSSESSED! And we're gonna figure this out! The judge is like alright whatever. Ed has a heart attack at some point, and he's on the mend for most of the film, until the plot no longer needs him to be. Lorraine has super psychic powers and can warp into past crimes to find clues the dumb cops cannot figure out, cause clearly this is a paranormal case.They find a satanic artifact under the house, and also a retired priest who knows everything about it. They spare no time just spelling it all out for you, to drive this plot forward.Homeboy is slowly becoming possessed in prison/mental health facility. Lorraine keeps having visions of crimes, Ed starts having visions too, and almost stabs Lorraine, then he's fine for a bit, and rinse and repeat. Terrible cgi, scenes that are as predictable as your next breath don't stop yet.Homeboy now fully possessed escapes his shackles, levitates, and try's to kill himself while a third priest attempts an exorcism. When that doesn't work, his girlfriend tells him she loves him, and he collapses to the floor no longer possessed. Simultaneously Ed and Lorraine are in a vision/possession themselves and Ed tells the demon the curse is broken. And that's it. Homeboy goes to jail for manslaughter for 5 years and his girlfriend and him marry.The actual audio tapes that play for a minute during the credits of the recorded possession are more entertaining than this film. It's captures nothing of the first film(s) aside from the fact it has the same actors.Overall this movie gave me some good laughs at the predictability, and overall moments that just don't make any sense. It's not scary by any means, you can see everything coming a mile away. I wish they had a better script since they called this a Conjuring movie, no fault to the actors they did what they could.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
924,mrjdweinstock,"Thrilling and an enjoyable experience, yet not as good as the other films.",8,9 June 2021,"The film was alright, I'm not scared by much, But this film did pack in some nice scares. Although I feel as if is a more thrilling type of movie. The effects for the possessions were creepy and nice. The actual ""based on a true story"" part of the movie was the smallest part of the movie. So that means they the actual events played very little into the actual movie. So it feels like the film created it's own entire other movie. Therefore the story is weird and a bit lacking. It does not benefit from not being another haunted house film, or a film which can stick closer to actual true events. The scares seemed a bit cheaper, the director did a decent job, although a bit disappointed it wasn't James Wan, but he was alright. So overall, a 7,7.5. If you are looking for great main characters and a film that is thrilling and fun, although even if the story is odd, and won't exactly keep you up at night, then I would say it is fine.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

As a die hard fan of the franchise, I was super excited for another great film about the paranormal investigators and demons and evil spirits... But there wasn't really much of that. It was mainly about them trying to stop a devil worshipping woman from cursing and murdering people. The jump scares were decent, I know because I had to hide behind my hand for a few of them, but the story just wasn't what I expected and it dissapointed me. No paranormal or evil spirits...

I am giving it five stars if I am to judge this movie independently. But if I compare it with the first two, it doesn't even deserve one star. I mean where is the horror? The only thing that makes it look like a Conjuring movie is the presence of Ed and Lorraine Warren. The amount of tension and bone chilling environment the first two created was absolutely phenomenal. This movie didn't make me scared even for a second.

It'll definitely send chills down your spine with some scenes, but, having said that, I feel that the movie wasn't scary overall. Talking about the cinematography: well, there's little one can do to make the cinematography of a horror movie better than what the current standard is. Frequent Jump scares, big reveals of secrets and ABSOLUTE BONE CHILLING MUSIC are things in a movie that will definitely give you a hard time sleeping for the next week.

936,CatM-,Really wanted to love this very unscary Movie!,3,29 June 2021,"I really enjoyed this movie for the most part but my only complaint was how confusing the plot & story line of the movie was. (so much so I had to watch it twice on HBO Max to understand it at all. There are multiple story lines all going at once. One of them never happened in real life & had nothing to with the plot of the movie The devil made me do it case & Exorcism the true real story the Warren's where a big part in. A woman is found murderd by her friend & a detective investigates the case & after watching the movie twice do not understand if they found the body or bodies are found where Lourain Warren said they were or they were found by the cops somewhere close because she is psychic but says she is not there & it moves so quickly she leaves with her husband the other Warren to get back to help The devil made me do it man & his friends & girlfriend while they also have a story line with a real life woman who practices witch craft and her father who is a catholic priest. I Googled & never found any information if true or not or embellished story line for movie. A quick Google revealed The extremely confusing third story line with the dead college girl friends & detective working on her case was fake & just for the movie. (Or to ruin what could of been a scary good movie.) Nobody not theWarrens Or any other clairvoyant had ever had anything to do with it. All of the other movie's on the franchise were amazing & super scary this one not so much & it was way to all over the place to be scary. The Conjuring Universes Movie ""The Curse of La Llorona"" gave me nightmares & Conjuring 1 & 2 were amazing supernatural horror movie perfection. Same with Annabelle. I am sure this movie did well at the Box office or by movie grossing sales. But that is only because of the Franchise being such perfect horror movies. But after this movie I doubt the next movie will do well in that department. My hope is they go back to the drawing board & not just give us subpar movie sequels because they just want to make money & they know they ha solid fan base that likely see whatever is put out. Which after Conjuring devil made me do it. I hope the die hard fans like myself will be seeing the next new movie in the franchise when it first opens unless the trailer & movie plot look like something unique & truly utterly nightmare inducing scary.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

951,jhssilva96,Terrible Piece of Movie,3,26 June 2021,"There are so much to talk about.I don't think that I've to haste anytime talking about this movie. It's bad. It doesn't scare you. It just talks about a story that happen, with no scary parts or anything. It just sad to watch and it's easy to guess the plot line. I don't recommend to watch this movie. I know that people spend their time to try to make a good movie. But it was without success. More suspense, more doors knocking, more sounds, more things that make a good rollercoaster of emotions. I know that it can be difficult when telling a story that people told that happen. But the funny thing about the movie it's to create a story and make the viewer enrole on it. Be scared, feel the sounds.. And of course something almost believable. I think it's a waste of time to watch horror movies, I said this because there are a few ones that are good. I guess it maybe hard to create one.I hope you enjoy the feedback. (I know that I focus a lot of the experience that you've seeing it. I think a good movie it's about the experience that you feel, the enroll, the curiosity. You almost feel it in this movie, but something is way of)Don't fall short on my review, if you want watch it. And take your conclusions. I'm not an expert reviewing. Just giving my opinion. No, I'm not being a downer or pessimist, trying to get as real as possible.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
952,annie_p,"Different, but excellent",8,23 June 2021,"This movie was a disapointment for young Wan fans who care about jump scares, but I think it might be more appealing to more mature viewers.I don't want to give too much detail and spoilers, but the plot is way more elaborated than the other installments, with a refreshing blend of exorcism, murder mystery and witchcraft, which was a plus in my opinion, as well as a little more depth to the main characters (the Warrens) and their relationship.In this movie, they are more the protagonists than in the previous films, where the story was centered on the victim families and the Warrens were called upon to help.Of course it's not a perfect movie. The pace is kinda weird: the beginning is very intense with adrenaline during the exorcism, then the part surrounding the moment Arne commits the murder is also intense in a different way, but then it kinda drags a little at some point while the Warrens are investigating.The ending is OK, but I would've liked it better if the intensity would've at least matched that of the beginning. It was predictable and the Warrens succeed a little too easily in my opinion.So, in short, if you want to see another haunted family story, rife with jump scares, you will be disappointed, If you want to see a good dark horror film, give this one a shot.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

956,tommyb42,Great acting and directing,7,8 June 2021,I've read many reviews lamenting the new director. I thought the direction was great. All actors were very strong esp Wilson and role players. I would have loved more creatures or jump scares (can get weary of reliance on possession scares) but there was enough. The 2nd and 3rd installment might be a touch heavy on intimacy btw characters (some moments slow and overdone-cheesy factor) but I was surprised at how well done this was. Probably a good theater movie. Definitely worth a watch.,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

In fact the Shock-Doc on Discovery was much better! Please don't disappoint the next time. It needs more thought and a psychological impact than the slapstick predicable scenes it morphed into.

Most of the jump scares were shown in the trailer which i found very annoying! The beginning was probably the most intense if I'm honest I was prepared for great things after the beginning took place.Unfortunately the story turned out to be boring and lacked direction, once I'd realised it was a human cursing people no possession as such just basic curses that did it for me I was gutted! Sorry guys but compared
to the last 2 conjuring films this one hasn't got a patch on them and correct me if I'm wrong we had witches in the first conjuring and possession came from their curse? So it's no different just seemed to be a tamed down version for teenagers instead. Some may disagree but I'm a die hard horror fan and this just didn't do anything for me!Still can't understand how the victims were connected as that was never explained just didn't really understand the story it was more about Lorraine's powers.Gutted I had to post this review as I've waited for this film to come out since I found out about it, but unfortunately it's not the best out of the 3 or any of the spin offs created.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

It does slow down and become more dramatic as it goes on, but it still works. If you liked The Exorcism of Emily Rose, this works on the same levels as that one.

992,hensleyprestonb,Chill my dudes it was totally great,8,9 June 2021,"The Conjuring movies are effective because the scares aren't cheap and the thrill feels like a solid action movie. You don't get that in horror or action movies anymore. This is a FUN movie that's also technically sound. It is not either of Wan's masterpieces, but I see it as a masterpiece all its own. It does what a Conjuring main line movie should do, and it does it well. Farmiga and Wilson bring their best game, and there's even a nice family message that doesn't feel tacked on or played out. It feels like it may even be true to the source material. It's authentic. I don't know what more fans could have asked for, but I feel the reviews are unjustly low only because Wan didn't direct. Thank God he didn't, I'm sure he would like to do something more interesting with his life now that he's already nailed two of the mainline Conjuring films as well as some others and he may have done movies that aren't Conjuring related as well *gasp* and this is good. The studio knows this and that's why they mix it up. I don't know the new guy but I hated all 3 minutes that I watched of the Nun. I had low expectations, but I'm glad I didn't skip this one and you shouldn't skip it either. There was more memorable here than anyone realizes yet. A stellar performance.

But the main problem that i thought about the movie was it doesn't have the Detailing as once it used be when Wan Filmographed . Unlike the previous movies of the franchise , we cannot able to connect with the Victim's family, the 2 movies was best in terms of the depth of the family characters , that made the audience to emotionally connect with the movie . But this movie focused on the Ed and Lorriane's part than the actual problem . But the horror portions are well choreographed and CG was also good for most of the part .

Yes the first part with the little boy is creepy, and the whole movie is creepy, but it was not scary. Made for teenagers, not adults.

1012,brainessister,Total disappointment,3,5 June 2021,"The first two films didn't have me guessing what was going on - Demon possession, scary stuff in the dark etc etc This film was more like a who dunnit. I was trying to work out who the baddy was when it shouldn't be that type of film.I scare easily and I didn't jump once. James Wan we need you back if there's going to be any more Conjuring films. I feel this was more PG than anything else *insert sad face here*",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
1013,thevikwest,The Devil Made me not watch at the cinema,3,7 June 2021,"The Devil Made me not watch at the cinema and thankfully I watched it at home. Because I wouldn't be able to stand 2 hours at the cinema of this slow-paced, going at 3 different storylines, lackluster ""horror"" movie. I really like the franchise, I have seen the Conjuring movies at least 2-3 times each, but I could barely stand through this one. Even my wife who enjoys this franchise went to bed early but I decided to stick through it.Apparently the director change plays a major role because this one just doesn't work. It goes all over the place and it's hard to keep track of the uninteresting ""side"" storylines (and I am calling them ""side"" because actually the main storyline - of the apparently infamous court case is a small part of this movie).You have firstly the main storyline - the case of Arne + some bit of flashbacks of how the demonic possession came to be. Then you have the missing girls. And then you have the satanist who ""ties it all together"". It was all just too much, too slow-paced and too boring.They could have focused only on the kid who first got possessed and then Arne's storyline. After all the poster says ""the case that shocked America"", not ""some made up story that has nothing to do with the actual case that shocked America"".I would not even recommend this movie to any fan of the franchise and it's a major SKIP.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
1014,dafelear,It is both good and bad at the same time,5,7 June 2021,"I have mixed reviews about this movie. It was definitely an incredible opportunity to see Ed and Lorraine Warren back in the screen.First of all, I love the visuals in this movie, the vivid colors and the makeup on Lorraine Warren was spot on! Not only that, the movie decided to offer incredible details for an 80's vibe movie, one example of this is the where Ed Warren turns the light knob when they were about to see Jessica's body in the mourning house.Second, we now know that Ed and Lorraine Warren had a child, as she is given a highlight in the movie.Moreover. The acting in this movie is out of this world! Personally, i love Debbie's acting and she should definitely be in some A.-class movies.Lastly, the movie has some Resident Evil action going on with Ed fighting a monster! This should definitely be the main theme in the next Conjuring movies!With some incredible actions going on, yet this movie has some cons around it.The prominent con is that the jokes in this movie are both predictable and cliché at the same time. I despise of this and the directors should certainly produce quality comedy in this big of a movie series (if they want to implement comedy in it).Speaking of predictability, the plot and jump scares are noticeably repugnant.Moreover, the daughter of Ed and Lorraine Warren is not given a great amount of highlight in the movie. If the daughter isn't getting enough highlight, I suggest the directors shouldn't really introduce her in the movie at all.Lastly, there are two small details in the movie that ""tickles"" me, the vivid colors in the movie makes the movie look ""younger"". Warner Bros should've did what they did on the first it movie. The first It movie was thrilling, jaw-dropping and it pulled me in my bedroom for quite a while.The other small detail is the scene where Lorraine Warren went to Father Kastner's house alone and when Father Kastner went into his ""storage room"", he just left Lorraine Warren wondering wtf did Father Kastner go. Eventually, Lorraine Warren went into the ""storage room"" and there he is turning on his lamp. From that moment we can see him sitting in his chair in the ""storage room"" in the dark. This is a very cliché move and it should not be in this movie.For me, small changes in the movie could definitely improve the ratings even in just a tiny bit.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

1020,londonruble,Not scary and story was ok at most,4,9 June 2021,"So first things first the scares we're just jump scares and that's it. And not a single one did I actually get a little uneasy with because each one was sooooo predictable like to the point where the jumpscare felt like it actually interrupted the movie. And the story was okay but my issue is that it didn't really add anything to the franchise! Honestly if the conjuring was a tv show then this be one big filler episode. Also the villain didn't feel unique at all and some may say oh well for the first time it was an alive human villain well that kinda makes more boring especially when they didn't even give her any personality. I know that's weird to say but if your gonna give an alive human villain for once then do something with it. If she was a ghost or a demon nothing would change. Really the only compliment I have is what got me through this movie and that's Ed and loraine warren. The first 2 conjuring movies they worked so well together and this one ain't different. Seeing them work together in this one was what kept me going through this boring mess, oh and there is some comedic moments that I loved cause those comedic moments each one hits the joke very well but other than that this movie was just frustrating and boring.

The plot was reasonably good but Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson carried this film all the way.

There's something about the way they do their expressions that makes every scene look good and you keep watching. I don't know how to describe it, but it's like you look at someone's acting and it looks like they did it right.

It wasn't a matter of waitong for dental records or anything.

1056,irahulsureshappu,Recommended Score: 8.3/10,9,4 June 2021,"The Conjuring 3 continues the paranormal adventures of the Warren couple. And for the third installment of the duo's based on true event story, the producers opted for something different than the previous two.No longer directed by James Wan, this time the film is helmed by Michael Chaves, who back in 2019, directed another horror movie called The Curse of La Llorona. An enjoyable but rather unremarkable horror movie. But the fact that he has directed a horror movie before, meant that he wasn't completely inexperienced in the genre. And ""The Devil made me do it"" is indeed a superior movie than La Llorona.What differentiates this third film from the previous two is how they expanded on the setting of the film. While the first and second Conjuring were mostly contained in one location, with the Warrens facing off against the demons in a battle of attrition type confrontation, this one turned it more into a paranormal mystery and investigation story.This changed the dynamic of the film where the constant pressure and tension present in the previous ones are broken by long periods of investigative threads that has the Warrens follow clues to piece together the mystery. While interesting and ultimately worth the pay-off (even if somewhat predictable), this had the effect of making the movie the least scary and tense of the series. And if the viewers were hoping that this one would up the ante in terms of scares, well, they may find themselves a little disappointed.Which isn't to say that the movie isn't good. It is. And for those viewers like me who have followed this series and its spin-off for years, and are invested in the characters of the Warrens (still played with believable charisma by both Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson), then this film would still be worth your time, if only to see them on screen once again.Though for how much longer their characters will sustain the interest of viewers, remains to be seen. Should they decide to continue their saga for one more story, I think they will need to do something that truly stands out, because this one did not raise the bar in any way.But even if they decide to call it quits and make this the last adaptation of the Warren's tale, there is enough of a sense of closure to be able to say goodbye to the characters, even if it didn't end with a bang.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

2. WITHOUT SPOILING IT the ending could have been where they put more of the trial honestly- it was a bit of a cop out ending.3.

The scares are REAL AND EFFECTIVE, as the events hook you right from the start until the last minute. Chaves proves himself to be a welcome and worthy addition with this darker and much more sinister, compared to all others of the Universe, despite his mediocre work in ""La Llorona"". As for Farmiga and Wilson, they are once again the very heart of the story and deliver strong perfomances that make you care about them.

It was mean to give you a scare and be more of a investigation type movie. The movie was very well paced and well written and yes it is different from the first two. By being different it brought the investigative side out of who the Warrens were and I though that was outstanding. If you are looking for a scare and a very suspenseful movie then you found it.

The film went way left field on a cult path straying far from the true events that occurred.

Yes there are some practicing witches in this world who are part of the satans church, but that wasn't the case in this movie. That was dark magick . Point blank PERIODT. I'm only mixing reality and a movie together because it was based on true events. Other than that I loved the movie . I've always loved the conjuring movie franchise.

The film has some of the best cinematography in a horror movie genre so far.

The story was well-thought out, and I wasn't bored once while watching. If you want a cheap jump scare movie, go see any other B horror movie.

There was pretty much no ""jump scares"" or anything that would show that this was an actual horror film.. it was just so boring the only entertaining bit was the first 5 minutes... the acting from Vera and Patrick was great as per.. but you can tell James wan had no say in this film it lacked that thrilling edge the other 2 had.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Its more of a compliment to the first two films rather than a slander towards this one.You can tell its the same director as La Llarona by the fact it has same pacing and style that he used in that film. For me this movie suffers from the same major set back as La Llorana does, and that is it's quite boring. It doesn't feel like a horror movies, scares were predictable and not even scary when they happened. I also didn't really care for the characters overall for the exception of Ed and Lorraine. Even though its not really a bad movie it comes no where close to the first two and just shows how great of a director James Wan is.But to end on a positive note the lighting and cinematography were absolutely beautiful in this film. Also the acting all round was great too.

1121,sharan-97163,More of a real story than a HORROR!!,9,7 June 2021,"The Conjuring: The Devil made me do it is a worth watching film in the Conjuring universe, this movie literally shows what really happened in Ed Warren and Lorraine's life and how this demonic case is bought to court and won justice. This is not a usual horror movie where in a family moves to a house and gets possessed by demons, of course the Glatzel family moves to an house and David Glatzel gets into contact with a demon by curse and it moves on to Arne as he invited it. But then its not only a demonic possession and also a curse by a women which is not usually you watch in a horror movie and this makes it somewhat different from any other horror movie.

1122,ravenswb,Not Good Enough to be a Conjuring Addition,3,7 June 2021,"After the first trailers released, the movie looked good in thrown around parts and bits, and you didn't have to question the story. But watching the actual movie was just awful. The first two Conjuring movies really embrace the severity and scare factor of demonic possession and things made of nightmare fuel. I understand that these movies are based on true events lived out by Ed and Lorraine, but The Devil Made Me Do It was barely in itself a ""Conjuring-esque"" movie. It started off like it was going to be a good addition to the Conjuring series, but it became too story driven without much of the spine-chilling visuals and fear-factor that we all are accustomed to from the conjuring film universe by now. The movie had a few too many heartfelt gushy moments to be a true thriller or horror movie. It was so bad some of the people I invited over to watch it with, who also were waiting to see it for months, lost interest and streamed other movies on their phones instead. This Conjuring movie was just too boring, over-hyped, and sadly disappointing. It honestly would've been better if the title didn't include ""The Conjuring"" in it, so your expectations would be set lower.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

It nowhere close to James Wans entries but more on par with the other conjuring spin off movies like Annabelle or the nun. Its an average horror flick, and has moment that are above average and some even good.The fact that its called the devil made me do it is probably to save the ""conjuring 3"" title for Wan to finish this as his trilogy.

1150,zapleft,Michael Chavez and his poorly executed films,1,12 June 2021,"A boring and exhausting movie for the public, meaningless script and scenes that are HORRIBLE, without a doubt the worst movie in the saga, in fact, one of the things that bothers me the most about this movie is the poorly done dialogues and scares that just make you laugh, for me this movie was a comedy and not a horror.

1151,fortune_tree-77541,Lacked direction with no entity,4,13 June 2021,Like the previous conjuring series you always had that central demon/entity that was causing havoc to the households.The movie claims to be based on a true story but there was no reference of witchcraft in the original events. Scares in this one lack impact and the movie does not make enough references to movies in the conjuring universe.James Wan adds that supernatural tension which was clearly missing from this movie.Worth watching but this one ranks below the nun and not a patch on annabelle/conjuring 1 and 2.,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Having read the true account of this case, I did not like the new plot of the film. The actual case centered around David and his interaction with the spirits possessing him. This is what made the case so intriguing as we have a real sense of how these entities go about their evil doings. For example, as described in the book, they would circle the family and chant and members would quarrel with one another. How they picked some individuals to work for them like Carl jr. He would claim the whole family was lying.I was hoping the movie would be more about David and the entities. Also, several priests were involved and there was difficulty in getting the church to approve the exorcism.Its a gd horror film and I recommend reading the book if you would like to know more about the actual case.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

1156,mandynk-67736,Ed and Lorraine's Darkest Cast Yet! A Very Unique Conjuring Film!,9,16 June 2021,"I saw The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It in theaters recently and I really loved it. The case and storyline is very different from the first two films (while still keeping things fresh), and it's Ed and Lorraine's most complex, most dangerous, and darkest investigation yet. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are phenomenal yet again as The Warrens. Like in the other films, their chemistry and love absolutely shines. The Arne Cheyenne Johnson case is very intriguing and unlike anything The Conjuring Universe has shown so far (true crime mixed with the supernatural), and the characters surrounding the case are interesting and keep you invested.As for the scares, there's plenty of them and they're very creepy and effective. Especially the unforgettable morgue scene with Ed and Lorraine. I literally had trouble sleeping that night because of that scene alone. The entire film overall has a very eerie, creepy atmosphere.The film introduces us to a new, intimidating antagonist called The Occultist. She's probably the most sinister villain yet and we see her and Lorraine in a psychic battle throughout the film. Lorraine's clairvoyance is explored more than ever this time and the film delves deeply into it. There's a lot of eerie and atmospheric moments (the opening scene is intense and full of action), lots of emotional and heartfelt moments between Ed and Lorraine, and the film still maintains that inspirational ""love conquers evil"" tone. That's another reason why I love The Conjuring Universe so much; they always remind us that light and love diminishes darkness and evil.However, there are a few things that I wish the film had done differently. Since this film is about a murder via possession, it would've been great if they had shown more courtroom scenes. Possibly even incorporate some of the scares in the trial parts of the film, that would've been great! I also think the story could've elaborated a little more on Arne and gave him some more dialogue, since he's after all one of the main characters. There were a few eerie scenes in the trailers that I wish had made it into the film. Also, I thought the pacing was rather fast. Those criticisms aren't enough to outweigh the good, though.The Devil Made Me Do It definitely deters away from the haunted house formula used for the first two films, but that's actually a great thing. We see The Warrens explore the paranormal beyond haunted houses and even collaborate with the criminal world, which they did in real life. The storyline offers the franchise something new, but still maintains those familiar Conjuring vibes that we all loved from the very beginning. It's a case of The Warrens that's sure to creep you out and dabbles in Satanic worship, cults, the dark and evil side of spirituality, ritualistic sacrifices, curses, witchcraft, murder, and more importantly, how Ed and Lorraine use the means to overpower those things.It's an overall different, yet unique and powerful installment in The Conjuring Universe. Highly recommend it, especially for fans! 9/10!",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

1158,jarrenwalker,Kinda disappointed,7,17 June 2021,I just seen this movie and I can say it's not as good as the other two it was just not really accurate at all a few parts here and there but pretty much all of it was made up for the movie it felt like there was so many things that they could've added to make it better more scary and more true it felt like there was no demon at all only the witch was doing everything even tho there actually was no witch in real life but nonetheless the acting was good it was pretty interesting to watch the jump scares were predictable this movie was good it could've been better and not nearly as good as the other two.,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

1161,salkicemil,Worst of the three,5,19 June 2021,Honestly the film felt to rushed. There wasn't any character connection that the audience could grasp. The plot was also a bit dry.

I'm not trying to do this for attention either. Popping noises are everywhere in my room. Not on the walls like normal but my bed and dresser too. I keep hearing wispers too each time I turn off the lights. I hear stuff moving across my bedroom floor and no one is in there. I really hope those real tapes didn't cause some curse because I stayed to watch it and none of this had ever happened till I saw it. I also heard faint knocking on my front door too but my dog didn't get up like normal to bark at it. Like I said I'm probably really scared.

The plot sadly is a bit predictable if you have already seen some horror movies. The story contiously got worse as the movies progressed. The movies heavily relies on jumpscares making it scary which might scary you for a second but now throughout the 110 minutes of the movie. Ending seems slighty weird. Im not sure how to describe it, but it does seem very weird.Overall pretty good, if you dont think about it too much. I would recommend it, but even more the former movies if you havent seen them yet. Great movie but not as good as they were in the past.

The Conjuring 3 saved and continued the style of the two previous and brought us a resonbale, thrilling, and interesting story. No dull moment in this film, jump scares and terrifying music just appeared at appropriate time. I am satisfied with these (My heart actually skipped a beat when one of a jump scares appeared but I cannot tell you this scene XD). Many feel more like a detective TV show but I do not think it is discordant or break the Conjuring Universe law. In contrast it provides us a new view of the Conjuring instead of just an exorcism story in an old house. Whatever, I do think it is an underrated film.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Why they looked more like zombie swamp creatures haha. Also it's the same story over and over. Someone gets possessed & then they come investigate, priest comes, possessed dude goes crazy, crosses flipping over. Haha yeah pretty much idk what else to say.

We've seen these movies before (and often), but there are actual jump scenes and smooth editing that make these movies worthwhile.That being said, this movie is the weakest in the series. The storyline, itself isn't great, and the best jump scenes we saw in the trailers. Even the title, ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" evokes a feeling of parody. I believe that ""Mad Magazine"" actually used that line (The Devil Made Me Do It) when they poked fun of ""The Exorcist"". It almost feels as if this movie was thrown together, and the writers just phoned it in.I'm a fan of these movies, and I'll probably watch the next one, because I enjoy how they tie things in with the other movies...but this movie really is the weakest.

1193,medeirossantosv,A mess,4,12 October 2021,"The first movie was really great. As a horror fan, I was really glad to finally see the genre having a good contemporary production. In the second one they didn't get it that right, but it was still good - though I was a bit disappointed with the special effects.Now, in the third movie it seems they chose to push the CGI effects way more than they should have, which makes a lot of scenes look very, very weird (they could have gone for less body contortion of the possessed people). It becomes just one more of those movies that rely mostly on showing scary images than on building tension through the plot. Regarding this aspect alone, it's a big step back if we compare it to the first one. Jump scares are not so present, which ends up being good as all the rest is kind of predictable.The story is a complete mess, you never really know what's actually going on or where it's going, people act like they're just running around trying to find themselves a story. Characters are not interesting, so we don't relate to them. Sure, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson still do a decent job (even though the writers didn't do them justice), but it's not enough to hold things together.I do not recommend it, unless you have watched the other two movies and are willing to complete the saga. If you're looking for a good movie, though, go see any other thing. You'll be better off skipping this one. I'm only giving it 4 starts instead of 1 because it's always interesting seeing the Warrens, but that's about all there is to it.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

1195,bayuah,Boring,5,27 June 2021,"I think, this film should be called as comedy. Seriously, I was really holding back my laughter at the beginning of the film. If not because I tried to respect another people at the theater, I probably laughing burst out control.The pacing not really bad also not good either, mediocre. Although still understandable. They tried to make connections of two really different events, which at first I was a little bit confused, but you really need think again about both to understand them.As I said, the beginning of the film looks like comedy, but that make it interesting. Even though, after that at the first part to the middle, I was almost fell asleep, and fortunately something interesting happened after that can make awake from your sleep. Do not worry, this film is really low on the scare-jumps. There was scare-jumps, but the film not really depend on it, because I think the film still can run smoothly even if they remove it.The really problem is so called based ""true"" (see the double quotes) story cliché that should not be emphasis of the film. This is based ""true"" story, bla-bla-bla. In same case, you know you can claimed that human breathing is based on true story. This is supernatural event, dude. Everyone that get supernatural event will get different perspective to their surrounding, therefor called as a ""true"" event is really debatable.In the end, if you really want to wasting your time or do not know what to do or just curious about the film, you can watch it.For disclaimer, I never see this franchise before, also this review is totally subjective.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Story and character is the reason why we care about the stakes-that's where drama, tension and horror comes from. If it was all jump scares and lacking in story (the movie Winchester comes to mind), I guarantee y'all would've been even more disappointed. But if that's your thing, you'll probably be just as entertained by a jack in the box. While remaining faithful to the Conjuring universe, I appreciated that this third movie explored new territory so it wasn't just a repeat. It is a quality addition to the series with good production value, and much more thoughtfully-written than the spin offs. It's a win for what it is considering the impossible task the writer and the director had of pleasing all these harsh fans who couldn't even tell you what they liked about the first two conjuring movies other than ""it was scary.""",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

Well, I have to disagree with that after watching this movie. I took a risk and watched Conjuring 3 at night with the lights off (I still wouldn't do it with Conjuring 1 and 2) and it really wasn't very scary. Yes, it's not a good sign when a horror movie isn't scary when a person is watching one alone at night. This movie gave us less scary and much more unreal moments, less tension, less sense of isolation. I may continue with my disappointments, but at the end of the day, there is one important thing that saved this movie and it is great acting. All the actors did a great job and they really saved this movie from a collapse . Giving 6/10 for a horror movie, or as I mentioned earlier for the 'Mystic Thriller' isn't bad at all, but it's definitely the worst movie out of 3.

I love all genres of movies with horror/paranormal always being my genre of choice as I have seen thousands over 40+ years from the lowest budget independents to the highest budget blockbusters. Both my adult sons and I agreed this was our favorite Conjuring out of all the Conjuring universe and Annabelle's, there were many scenes that you find yourself saying out loud daaaaaang, such fun and awesome special effects and the music/sound effects were absolutely unsettling. If you care more about getting creeped out than what type of camera was used at what angle with what lighting that should have been used in the scene prior as opposed to after because what this character said should have meshed with the plot better then you will be glad you saw it.

1228,kiersten_mork,I found the scares that the other reviewers missed,9,6 June 2021,"Looking at the reviews, and I see a lot of ""where are the scares!"". First of all, I'll say this movie is the best scary movie to come out in some time. Guys...we needed this.Second, there were tons of moments that made my skin crawl, look away out of fear, and make me just downright feel all slimey and gross. The CGI is incredible in this film, I liked how they didn't hide anything like they've done in past movies (like that time a demon was being exorcised under a sheet...really?) in this movie, boy...you see lots. I find the scares were sophisticated, and definitely played with the psychological mind. I'd prefer that over tacky random jump scares any day. The scares made sense. That's all I want!The antagonist was creepy, I just wish we learned a little bit more about the back story there. So much plot in so little time, I understand why some things were left out. I just wanted more!Vera and Patrick were once again unstoppable. I will say I spent the first half of the movie very very very confused about who all the characters are and how they all know each other, aside from the main protagonists of course. But the kids...Are they related? Dating? Friends? Where does the little boy come from? Who knows! Maybe I missed something, but my mom and I were really confused and I had to google it mid-way LOL.Anyways. Great movie, come for the scares, stay for the plot and execution. Well done, best horror movie of 2021? And possibly 2020?? Lol.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

1231,azamryan,Fine but the weakest of the 3,5,26 May 2021,"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It""I think its about time they accepted the existence of the Devil.""I got an exclusive early screening to see the newest and latest Conjuring film and I've overall simply liked the first two but what did I think of this...What I liked was the plot was actually different, they took a new approach with these characters and gave them a problem we haven't seen them dealt with before and it was nice to see that. All performances were great, they all did their best. There was a great creative scene which actually gave me chills, and there were some nice shots but only a few...What I didn't like was, the CGI was unfinished, it was awful to look at. Also there were moments that could've been better executed or better written, they just felt a little lazy and brushed over. I'll be honest out of all 3 films this is the least scariest one, no jump scare got me and the one thing that gave me chills was more of a ""Cool"" moment. I just wasn't scared, not even once. I also thought the direction was boring, James Wan added so much to the other two films with his directing talent, but this director... just felt like plain bread. James Wan should've directed this.Overall, I thought this was just fine, a cool interesting turn in events for the main characters, but lacking with any scares and boring bland direction made it the weakest of the three films. I'm giving The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It ⭐⭐1/2.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It

First off, if you're looking for suspense, tension, demons, decent cinematography...all the goods of the first films...you will not find it in the almost 2 hours of pieced together rubbish that is the conjuring 3. There is zero character development and by the end you won't even care that you don't understand what is going on. The special effects are laughable, as is the dialog and whatever the plot is.

1264,nocturne_x,Huge Conjuring fan and loved it,8,7 June 2021,Disagree with most of the reviews. One of the few times I was glad to dive straight into watching a film before letting IMDb discourage me. By no means the best in the series but held me the entire time. When I see comments saying it's not scary enough I wonder what viewers are looking for. More jump scares? It seems the horror film genre is chained to that style now. This is a quality story being told and in that it succeeds. No plot holes just a solid story from start to finish. Plenty of scares along the way. I honestly feel that we've become pretty desensitized to scares in general so the new director Chaves had perhaps an impossible task laid before him. Could Wan or my personal favorite horror director Mike Flanagan have done a better job? Perhaps but Chaves did a fine enough job here. Perhaps my favorite part of the film is the shift from generic possession to the concept of being cursed. It flips the script to where you as the viewer want specfic retribution whereas with possession it's harder to exact revenge because it's so ubiquitous. I though the ending was great so again going against the popular opinion.,The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
1265,andreanvernier,Disappointing and Annoyingly Convoluted,4,5 June 2021,"If you go into this movie hoping for another knockout from the Conjuring Universe, think again.

And sadly, I was right. This one has a different vibe to it. The story is interesting at first, but the ending didn't work for me. I just couldn't care about the characters, other than the Warrens of course. Don't get me wrong, it's watchable, just keep in mind that it won't be as good as the previous two films were. It's a dissapointment, but a watchable one I guess. If they ever do a fourth one, I really hope James Wan will return to do it. Chaves did La Llorona and this one, and I can say for sure that his movies are not the strongest ones in the conjuring universe.",The Conjuring - The Devil Made Me Do It
