0,TheLittleSongbird,A mediocre Halloween,4,14 January 2018,"John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. 'Halloween II' is not the worst of them, or one of the worst of them. It is not really a good film, not by a long shot, but oddly enough it still manages to be one of the better 'Halloween' sequels and one of the few semi-watchable ones despite its glaring faults.'Halloween II' has strengths. It is one of the better-looking and more polished sequels and has a suitably eerie look. The music has a spine-chilling atmosphere, if not as much as the first 'Halloween' and not as big a character of its own that the music in the original was.Didn't care much for the acting generally, but both Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance make successfully game efforts and Michael Myers does evoke some creepiness. There are also unfortunately some significant drawbacks. The biggest fault is that the atmosphere and tone are just wrong. The film just feels like a stale retread minus the chilling scares, nail-biting suspense and the feeling of being unsettled. There is nothing creative or shocking about the scares or deaths, it's all by-the-numbers, over-familiar and indifferent. Everything is just too predictable and dull in pace to be remotely suspenseful. Stupidity is also all over the film. So many moments are intelligence-insultingly ridiculous and almost illogical, and the hospital setting would have been more effective if it wasn't so under-populated and drab (it actually didn't feel like a hospital at all). Didn't care for the direction either, there is no flair and very little engagement with the material, at times there is too much of an imitation of the direction of the first 'Halloween' but with no success.Curtis and Pleasance aside, the acting is ropey and everybody has to work with a clunky script, with a stilted flow and a lot of unintentional laughs, and annoying characters (with the old characters being so dumbed down that they are no better).Overall, mediocre but one of the semi-watchable sequels of the series. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Halloween II
1,Leofwine_draca,Second bite of the apple,6,22 November 2013,"The thing I like about HALLOWEEN II is that it offers up a direct continuation of the original movie, set literally minutes after the first film ends. Much of the tense atmosphere is still here from the first film, along with the important cast members. The general look and feel of the movie is the closest to the first film out of all the sequels, which is no surprise given that it was the first sequel and the later ones were made during the glossier period of the late '80s.Let's also make something clear: this isn't as good as the original. It can't be, because it doesn't have John Carpenter back as director. Rick Rosenthal does the best job he can, but he's not going to equal Carpenter's level of sheer style so emulation is the best he can do. The good news is that the classic synthesiser music is back from the first and just as chilling as it ever was. The same can be said for Curtis and Pleasence, who might as well have shot these films back-to-back, so exact are they in their performances. The stalk 'n' slash sequences are effective, and the finale is memorably over the top, so slasher fans will be in their element.",Halloween II
2,SnoopyStyle,works well when in hospital,6,22 October 2013,"This follows the events of the first movie picking up from the final few scenes of that movie. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is transported to Haddonfield Medical Clinic. Meanwhile Michael Myers continues to leave a trail of victims as he hunts Laurie. Dr Loomis tracks down Myers with the help of Sheriff Brackett.This movie is unlike most other movies because there is no setup. It just continues from the original as if it's the next episode in a series. This way there isn't as much of a build up. We're just jolted right into this movie.The story meanders around until we get to the hospital. Once we get there, the killings are better set up. The desolate nighttime hospital is very conducive to the eerie slasher killer vibe. The movie works quite well in that section.",Halloween II
3,Sleepin_Dragon,"Not as good as the first, but a worthy follow up.",7,25 October 2020,"The original has its critics, but for me, it's a masterpiece, a film that really brought the genre to life, question is, does the sequel do justice to the first?Brave to do a direct continuation of the first, meaning that night of terror truly does continue, it's no wonder poor Laurie Strode had her problems.I've got two copies of it, and maybe it was the way it was filmed, but it doesn't look as slick as the first, some of the camera work looks cheap. The opening music is horrid, true eighties synth, it's not good. The original music is so much better, when they do use the original incidental music it works so much better.A few clichés, including the useless security guard, bits of nudity and deserted hospital, but overall I still think it's a pretty good movie. Enough scares, and moments to make you jump, albeit delivered with less subtlety, which is what made the first work so well.Overall, it's still a good watch. 7/10.",Halloween II
4,gavin6942,"Considered a Copy, But a Very Good Copy If You Ask Me",7,3 November 2010,"Halloween isn't over... Michael Myers survives the battle with Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and continues his quest to find and kill Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), now in a hospital. Woe to those who get in his path! Mike Mayo says this film starts the series ""on a downward spiral"" and Howard Maxford calls it ""unnecessary"". I guess I can't say it was ""necessary"", but Mayo is unfair... the series really doesn't sputter until after this, and compared to some horror franchises, it's pretty decent.In fact, this film is a strong follow-up. It's consistent, it follows continuity, the blood is upped a bit (allegedly this was added by John Carpenter after Rick Rosenthal wrapped). As far as sequels go, it's pretty strong. Sure, it doesn't stray from the first one much, but can't that be a good thing? It's when the series stops following the story that it gets really messed up.",Halloween II
5,lee_eisenberg,A good continuation,8,21 December 2005,"Picking up exactly where the original left off, ""Halloween II"" has Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) getting transferred to the hospital, while Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) continues looking for Michael Myers. In the process of everything, we learn some things about the characters (like a little something about Laurie that would play a part in the later movies). Of course, in the process, Michael himself goes around killing people. A particularly interesting scene is how he kills a woman in the hospital. Oh, and by the way, this is Dana Carvey's film debut (interestingly, he later co-starred with Mike Myers, whose name sounds like the killer here). A worthy sequel it is. Numbers 4, 5, and 6 were pathetic (and #8 apparently was), #7 was really cool, while #3 wasn't even really part of the series.",Halloween II
6,jboothmillard,Halloween II,2,3 November 2008,"Apparently this was meant to be the conclusion to the series, maybe it should have been, but more sequels do seem inevitable, written by the previous film's director (and composer) John Carpenter, directed by Rick Rosenthal (Halloween: Resurrection). Basically the film picks up where it left off, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) shooting Michael Myers six times, he falls out the window, and managed to survive and disappear, while Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to hospital. If you remember the first film really well, you would know that the suburban area was sleepy, it must have been like 2 or 3 in the morning, and now all of the sudden there are many people out and about, and that's away from the hospital. Anyway, Michael is obviously trying to find Laurie, and in the process kills some more people, oh, and you find out Laurie is Michael's biological sister, which gives you I suppose a good demented reason to kill her, you know, because he killed his other sister as a kid. Also starring Charles Cyphers as Sheriff Leigh Brackett, Jeffrey Kramer as Graham, Lance Guest as Jimmy Lloyd, Pamela Susan Shoop as Karen Bailey, Hunter Von Leer as Deputy Gary Hunt, Dick Warlock as The Shape (Michael), Leo Rossi as Budd, Ana Alicia as Janet Marshall, Ford Rainey as Dr. Frederick Mixter and Wayne's World star Dana Carvey as WWAR Assistant. I can agree that, perhaps besides H20: 20 Years Later, all the sequels are rubbish, but what makes them even more ridiculous is that Pleasance clearly dies in this one, blowing himself and Michael up with gas and a lighter, Michael I can understand surviving, seeing how many hits he took in the first film, but Pleasance I can't understand surviving. As for the film itself, the remade music is completely rubbish (with the added keyboard), the deaths are okay, but you just can't really be shocked or surprised by them, a rubbish horror sequel, and many more follow. Pretty poor!",Halloween II
7,Woodyanders,A worthy follow-up to the outstanding original,8,24 January 2007,"This surprisingly solid sequel starts off immediately where the original ended, with poor Laurie Strode (the ever-personable Jamie Lee Curtis) being sent to the local hospital to be treated for her injuries. Naturally, the relentless Michael Myers (an effectively eerie pantomime performance by veteran stuntman Dick Warlock) continues to stalk Laurie. Wildly obsessive psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence deliciously hamming it up with his usual rip-snorting brio) comes to the rescue.Director Rick Rosenthal does a capable job of creating a palpably claustrophobic atmosphere, maintains a steady pace throughout, and stages the grisly murder set pieces with nasty aplomb (gory highlights include a couple of throat slashings, a hammer to the head, and a needle through the eye, plus one victim even gets drained of all her blood). A strong bunch of actors and actresses acquit themselves well as the hospital staff, with especially praiseworthy turns by Lance Guest as a nice guy orderly, Leo Rossi as a crass foul-mouthed jerk ambulance driver, the lovely Pamela Susan Shoop as a sweet nurse (Shoop also does a great topless scene), Cliff Emmich as a diligent security guard, and Ford Rainey as a weary old doctor. The hospital setting proves to be suitably remote and stifling; there's a sense of isolation and vulnerability to the place that's genuinely unnerving. But what really makes this movie a sound sequel is the several ways it radically differs from the original: the tone is grim and morbid rather than spooky and moody, the violence is more graphic and plentiful, and there's even a chilling explanation provided for Myers' personal vendetta against Laurie (WARNING: Possible *SPOILER* ahead. She's his long lost sister, which makes Myers desire to kill her that much more scary and disturbing). The last third of the film makes for a harrowing ordeal and things wrap up on a beautifully haunting closing note (the inspired use of ""Mr. Sandman"" helps out a lot here). Dean Cundey's typically polished and agile gliding cinematography rates as another substantial asset. Overall, it's a fine and enjoyable sequel to the superior '78 seasonal slasher classic.",Halloween II
8,Tweekums,A more violent but less scary sequel,7,3 June 2020,"This film follows on straight after the events of the first film. Michael Myers has been shot six times by Dr Loomis but there is no sign of a body. Loomis is convinced that he is still alive and will kill again. As Loomis and the police search for Myers, Laurie Strode is taken to the hospital for treatment. Myers is there soon picking off doctors and nurses in various ways.The original film was very scary but not excessively gory; this film notably increases to level of gore but unfortunately it isn't as scary. This is because once Myers gets into the hospital it is just a succession of characters we don't really care about getting brutally murdered. The characters we do care about, Laurie and Dr Loomis, are side-lined for too long as she is in bed, off screen and he is out looking for Myers in places he isn't. The hospital setting is good although one has to suspend ones disbelief more than a little as it seems remarkably quiet. Overall this is a decent enough film but a little disappointing considering how good the first was... that was a classic; this isn't.",Halloween II
9,ma-cortes,Following to Carpenter's classic with more astonishing killings and loads of blood,6,14 October 2008,"This creepy sequel and gore galore film has to Michael Myers again doing a criminal spree . Following up to pursuit Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) at same night that the first movie terminates . Again Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and sheriff Bracket (Charles Cypher )going after Micheal Myers who makes a real massacre in a hospital where work various nurses and doctors (Leo Rossi, Jeffrey Kramer , Lance Guest, among others).The film displays thrills , chills , cardboard horror ,tension and lots of blood and gore for nauseating execution . The grisly murders are extremely scary and eerie with abundant stabbing shots . As always, Michael makes an authentic slaughter with gruesome and bloody assassinations using his supernatural and immortal force . The film is set immediately after the first Halloween (1978). Since Jamie Lee Curtis had begun to wear a much shorter hairstyle in the 1980s, she had to wear a wig that matched her original hairstyle for the film . This is one of the only two films released by Universal Studios ; after the massive success of the first film, Universal picked up the sequel . When Halloween III(1982) didn't fare so well, Universal gave the rights to Trancas International, an affiliate of Universal's, who produced the films until 1989. In 1996, the rights were sold to Miramax . Usual musical score by John Carpenter (also producer and screenwriter along with Debra Hill). The motion picture was professionally directed by Rick Rosenthal .

10,BA_Harrison,A passable sequel.,6,10 November 2009,"Picking up immediately where the original left off, Halloween II sees knife-wielding killer Michael Myers disappearing into the night, despite having already been shot six times (How many times? Six times! How many? I shot him six times! So that's six times then? I shot him six times!) by trigger happy Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance).As 'Six Times' Loomis continues to track Michael down, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to the nearby Haddonfield Memorial Hospital for treatment. It's not long, of course, before Michael shows up to pay her a visit, scalpel in hand (but no sign of any flowers, choccies, Lucozade, or puzzle book—the thoughtless git!).With director Rick Rosenthal doing a reasonable job of emulating John Carpenter's visual style (careful use of shadows and shot framing once again creating some wonderfully unsettling moments), Halloween II does manage to deliver some pretty effective scares and nasty kills; but since it was designed primarily to cash in on the mega-success of the original, rather than because a great story was still waiting to be told, the film suffers from a poorly developed script which reduces Laurie to the role of bait, relies a little too much on contrivance (eg. the teenager dressed like Michael, who gets roasted, leading the police to believe the killer is dead), and is eventually forced to throw in a crazy motive for Michael to continue his pursuit of poor old Laurie—she is his baby sister.Oh well, at least the film does the decent thing and features quite a few killings (the total body-count is 13, which includes several stabbings, a hypodermic needle in the eye, a hammer in the head, and a fatal scalding), plus there is some much appreciated female nudity courtesy of jugtastic nurse Karen (Pamela Susan Shoop), who strips off for some sexy time in a hydro therapy pool.",Halloween II
11,moonspinner55,"Oh, let the nightmare end...",1,13 April 2002,"An absolutely rotten concoction, reeking with poor humor, dumbbell suspense, buckets of blood and over-the-hill 'teenager' Jamie Lee Curtis screaming...screaming...screaming for her agent? Apparently done as a favor to the producers, Curtis is cast yet again as babysitter Laurie Strode, this time taking on boogeyman Michael Myers in a mostly-deserted hospital on the same night as 1978's ""Halloween"". I'm not a big fan of John Carpenter's original film--with its sloppy editing, weak acting and monotonous music--but at least it had a solid sense of time and place, moments of style and a creepy-funny ending. ""Halloween II"" throws all that out, trashing the first film while meagerly attempting to duplicate Carpenter's style (and his illogical sensibilities). Director Rick Rosenthal has too little to work with; who are all these victims? At least the first batch of victims were characters we got to know. This is a scrapheap of a movie, inane and inept. * from ****",Halloween II
12,Quinoa1984,Just as good as part 1,7,12 July 2000,"To be honest, I saw this film before part 1, so I actually found this film better than part 1 (that was until I saw part 1).  This film is still scary and well done.  It picks up exactly where part 1 left off (with Michael getting up after being shot 6 times) and showing Donald Pleasence saying one of his most memorable lines (I shot him 6 times!  I shot him in the heart!). Jamie Lee Curtis also returns, in a hospital, which props Mike Myers (not the SNL star) to go after some fresh kill at the Haddonfield clinic.  Very good film, with John Carpenter not retunring to direct (or ever again) but does co-write and co-produce the film with Debra Hill.  Well done. A+",Halloween II
13,Coventry,"...later that night, in Haddonfield.",6,23 September 2003,"Halloween II does something rather unique. I haven't seen that many times before. It actually continues immediately after the original. Dr. Loomis ( the almighty Donald Pleasance ) just shot Michael Myers but he stood up and walked away...into Haddonfield city. Laurie is taken to the hospital and Dr. Loomis and the local sheriff continue to hunt Michael. That's the story...it's not much but at least you're in the middle of it. They might as well could have made Halloween a 180 minutes feature of terror but I doubt the original would have ever received the status it enjoys now...SMALL SPOILERS !!! What every ( slightly clever ) viewer already suspected gets confirmed in Halloween II. Jamie Lee aka Laurie Strode isn't just a random target in the eyes of Michael... She's his sister and was adopted two years after Michael killed his other sister. I don't know, I guess he likes to be the only child ? So, he has decided to get rid of Laurie too and hangs around in Haddonfield till he finds her. In the meantime, he'll spend his time by killing some innocent people who work in the hospital or just happen to walk in his way. END SPOILERS!!!!Of course Halloween II isn't the masterpiece or the milestone the original was. A lot of people ( and I do mean A LOT ) call the original the best horror movie ever made because of his trendsetting and atmosphere. I don't think it's THE best but I still agree it's a great movie. No wonder the sequel can't live up to that. The surprise element is gone, the atmosphere is a bit ruined and Michael doesn't look that scary anymore. There is less use of the chilling music ( by Carpenter himself) which increases the ""bore-aspect"" as well. Although the original only had 4 or 5 killings ( while Halloween II has 11 or 12), this episode is a lot less creepy. Donald Pleasence still is great, of course, and Jamie Lee can still scream as loud as before.It certainly isn't a must see, but if you do see it, you won't regret it. It's a nice way to kill 90 minutes.After this one, they tried something completely different with the Halloween concept. Halloween III: Season of the Witch became one of the biggest failures in horror history. A bit undeserved, I think. It wasn't THAT bad, it just didn't have Michael. They only made that mistake once, because episode 4 was widely announced as THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS.",Halloween II
14,Theo Robertson,Helps If You Remember The Context It Was Made In,6,28 April 2014,"As soon as a film is a hit producers fall over themselves turning the original one off movie in to a long running franchise . Truth be told when you have a film like THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS an idea that that is stretched to breaking point and barely has enough substance to fill one 90 minute movie you really do view Hollywood with cynical contempt . This wasn't the case and John Carpenter's original HALLOWEEN from 1978 didn't really suffer from wanting to start off a franchise . True the ending of the original was totally open ended but there was an ambiguity to it and if that movie remained a self contained one off it leaves the audience with a sense of fear that Michael Myers might be coming to a town near them in the imminent future "" Man in mask goes around murdering random passer bys "" hasn't got a lot of milage but we are talking about the early 1980s where the obsession with sequels was only just beginning and the over familiarity of the concept wasn't yet blasé or indeed over used . You should keep this in mind about the original Carpenter movie and that it was a relatively original take on the horror genre . . Not only that but Carpenter did mange to inject a feeling of menace and danger in to the finished product with a creepy musical score and intelligent use of foreshadowing . He is replaced by director Rick Rosenthal for this sequel but Carpenter's influence is all over the directorial style and we get creepy music and keep an eye out on the background where we're just able to make out something bad is about to happen at key moments .If there's a sense of disappointment it's that the returning characters played by Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis are rather sidelined for much of the film . Pleasence runs around screeching "" I shot him six times in the heart and he's not dead . He's not human ! "" only to get arrested by the police which led me to believe he'd be stuck in the police interrogation room trying to convince the police he's not insane while overacting in a most disgraceful manner but this isn't really how things develop while Jamie Lee Curtis remains unconscious in a hospital bed for the entire first half of the run time . As the story develops it's hardly groundbreaking but it is very good at doing what it does in an era where this type of stalk and slash horror movie would still be relatively fresh",Halloween II
15,Hey_Sweden,"""You don't know what death is!""",8,29 September 2012,"Thoroughly enjoyable sequel to John Carpenters' horror masterpiece picks up immediately where the first film left off, with the murderous ""Shape"", a.k.a. Michael Myers (now played by stuntman Dick Warlock) on the loose in Haddonfield, tailing his quarry Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to the hospital where she's been taken and slaughtering everybody in his way. Fortunately, intrepid Dr. Loomis (the great Donald Pleasence) is still around to doggedly pursue the stealthy Myers.John Carpenter and Debra Hill return to write and produce ""Halloween II"", while Carpenter mostly turns over the directorial reins to then newcomer Rick Rosenthal, who does a more than capable job of maintaining the style of the original. A number of the technical crew return (including ever reliable cinematographer Dean Cundey and camera operator Ray Stella). We do see more of Myers than ever before, but there are still great sequences where we see things from his perspective.One can hardly fail to notice that ""Halloween II"" is more in the mold of the slashers of the time than its predecessor. It substantially increases the body count, has Myers change up his methods of murder a fair bit, and raises the level of gore. Some scenes are ingeniously staged, when things happen in the background of which characters in the foreground are unaware. The aspect of using security camera perspectives is another fine touch. Carpenter does a typically fun job with the music, bringing back the old themes and adding new stuff with the assistance of Alan Howarth (their first collaboration).The cast does praiseworthy work, even if Jamie Lee doesn't play too big a part until the climactic chase; Pleasence once again lends true gravitas to the story. Charles Cyphers briefly reprises his role of Sheriff Brackett, Lance Guest is lovelorn paramedic Jimmy, Gloria Gifford, Pamela Susan Shoop, Tawny Moyer, and Ana Alicia are a very attractive group of nurses (Shoop also gives us a delectable breast shot), Hunter von Leer is solid as the deputy who takes over in Bracketts' absence, Nancy Stephens returns to the role of nurse Marion Chambers, and Leo Rossi adds some humour as the lewd and crude Budd. (Pay close attention and you'll also see Warlock in a secondary role as a cop, and Dana Carvey, in his film debut, as an assistant to a TV producer.)It's up to the individual viewer how much or how little they appreciate the new twists Carpenter brings to the tale, or the fact that more explanation is given as to why Myers does the things that he does.In any event, ""Halloween II"" is good entertainment, exceptionally well paced, suspenseful, violent, and genuinely exciting by the end. It's a worthy sequel to a classic original.Eight out of 10.",Halloween II
16,Doylenf,Haddonfield hospital is under attack...Michael is back...,6,30 August 2006,"A very respectable sequel, surprisingly enough, in an age where most sequels fail to capture the spirit of the original. The gore has been made a little more graphic, the scene has shifted to the hospital where Laurie was taken after the attack at her home, and everything moves in proper horror movie form under a different director but with the same nerve-jangling music that provided goosebumps in the original.JAMIE LEE CURTIS reprises her role as the hapless victim who shows spunk and courage even when she sees others around her being viciously attacked by Michael Myers and DONALD PLEASENCE is more determined than ever to capture the raving lunatic hellbent on turning Haddonfield Hospital into one large morgue.It's all strictly in keeping with the logic (or lack of it) that inspired the original, with the man in the mask more visible this time which makes some of the scenes even more scary. Dr. Loomis gets caught in a fiery explosion of fire at the climax, which makes us wonder whether he'll reappear for the next installment or not.There are those who think the film has a better pace than the first HALLOWEEN.",Halloween II
17,preppy-3,Pretty good--for what it is,7,23 November 2005,"Sequel to ""Halloween"" picks up right where the original ended. Michael Myers is still on the loose and after Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) who's lying drugged up in the hospital. Meanwhile Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) continues his hunt for him all over town but Myers (somehow) knows Laurie is in the hospital and heads for it...This film starts off (and ends) with the song ""Mr. Sandman"" which, if you think about it, DOES fit the movie. This movie is not as good as ""Halloween""...but how could it be? Still this movie makes some serious mistakes. Myers is turned into a killing machine--slaughtering people left and right for no reason. The first murder is totally pointless. His murders are VERY bloody--totally the opposite of what the original was. He's also given a stupid back story which wasn't needed.There are huge script problems too--Myers breaks into a school (why?) and prints ""Samhain"" (an ancient Druid saying) on a blackboard--how is a homicidal maniac going to even KNOW what Samhain is? Curtis is comatose and near death at one point but she's next seen stumbling around the hospital. The front door of the hospital is unlocked but mysteriously becomes locked when Curtis is trying to enter. Also this is the darkest and most unpopulated hospital I've ever seen.Acting varies--poor Curtis has to act drugged up the entire film and Pleasence is lousy (but the dialogue he's given is pretty bad). On the plus side it IS well directed by Rick Rosenthal effectively using the wide screen (try to see it letter-boxed). Rosenthal was criticized for all the explicit violence in the film but he said John Carpenter (who produced the film) shot all the gore inserts. It was never really resolved.So there are tons of things wrong with this film--so why am I giving it a 7? It moves quickly, is well-directed and throws a gory death at you every 7 minutes or so--you're never bored. So if you turn off your mind COMPLETELY this is lots of fun. If you don't--you're gonna hate it. A good MINDLESS horror film.",Halloween II
18,poolandrews,"Standard early eighties slasher film, but it's good of it's type and overall I liked it.",6,31 December 2004,"Halloween II opens with the on screen caption 'Haddonfield, Illinois, October 31st, 1978' and the song Mr. Sandman playing in the background. We pick up just before the original Halloween (1978) left off and after a short recap we are into the main title credit sequence, it features the cool Halloween theme (by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth) with a pumpkin in the left hand side of the screen. As the credits roll it gets bigger and bigger, eventually splitting open and revealing a skull inside. I must admit I thought this opening credit sequence is cool, not enough thought goes into them usually. Anyway, on with the film. Micheal Myers (Dick Warlock) was not killed when Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) shot him six times in the chest. Myers wanders the neighbourhood, he steals a knife from a Mrs. Elrod's (Lucille Benson) kitchen. He kills a young girl named Annie Brackett (Nancy Kyes as Nancy Loomis) who happens to be the daughter of the local Sheriff, Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers). Along with Dr. Loomis, Deputy Gary Hunt (Hunter Von Leer) is now even more determined to capture Myers. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), the survivor from the original Halloween, is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital to receive treatment. A masked man is knocked down and killed in Haddonfield, the authorities think it may be Myers and await dental conformation as the body is badly burnt. This gives the real Myers a chance to slip through the relaxed police presence and go after Laurie. Laurie has been seen by Dr. Frederick Mixter (Ford Rainey) and is placed on the ward under the supervision of head nurse Mrs. Alves (Gloria Gifford) and her nurses, Jill Franco (Tawny Moyer), Janet Marshall (Ana Alicia) and Karen Bailey (Pamela Susan Shoop). One of the paramedics who brought Laurie in, Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) recognises her from school and decides to stay with her, his mate Budd (Leo Rossi) instead decides to try and have sex with the nurses, I'm with Budd on this one! Mrs. Alves discovers that the phones aren't working and sends the security guard Mr. Garrett (Cliff 'Fatty' Emmich) to have a look. Myers puts an axe in his head and sets about finding and killing Laurie, and anyone who gets in his way! Meanwhile it turns out that the dead body belonged to a teenage kid named Bennett Tramer (Jack Verbois) and that Myers is still on the loose. After a fellow Doctor, Marion Chambers lets lip some restricted information about Laurie and Micheal, Loomis realises that all Myers wants to do is kill Laurie and sets off for the hospital. But will he be too late? Directed by Rick Rosenthal I quite liked this. The script by John Carpenter and Debra Hill is a little clichéd and routine, but it does what it does rather well. It has a fair body count and some decent gore and good special effects, a hypodermic needle in an eye, someone drowned in scalding hot water, an axe in a head, a burnt corpse, stabbings and a slit throat. It moves along at a fair pace and I really liked the way it picked up from the original and continued straight on with the story, in fact you could probably edit both of them together and get one long film. Acting is OK, but Jamie Lee Curtis seems underused especially during the first hour when she's just a patient in a hospital bed doing nothing in particular. Pleasence seemed to ramble on a little too much as well. Technically the film is solid, music, editing, sets and photography. But why set it in the darkest and most underpopulated hospital on Earth?! Why only three nurses for the entire hospital, I've heard of staff shortages but this is ridiculous! Why, apart from the little girl at the start with a razor blade in her lip, are there no other patients? I thought this was a good continuation of the Halloween story and a worthy sequel, worth a watch for horror fans although casual viewers may find it a little dark and silly at times. Decent enough.",Halloween II
19,utgard14,Good But Flawed Sequel,6,2 November 2013,"Good sequel to a classic that, of course, doesn't hold a candle to the original. It's really less of a sequel than a continuation of the first movie as it begins where the first movie ends. Right from the start you realize Donald Pleasence will steal the show and he does an amazing job, as he did in Halloween.With Carpenter not at the helm, the direction is not as good but I expected that going in. Still, there are several memorable scenes that are well directed by Rick Rosenthal. In addition to Pleasence, Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role. Although she has less to do than in the first and spends the entire film with a bad wig on, she still does well.Following up movies that are as influential and impressive as Halloween is not easy and most movies that try fail badly. I try not to hold such sequels to a ridiculous standard. Does it match the first film in any way? Not really. It repeats some of the things the first film did well but it's not an innovative film. But it is solid entertainment. I think that goes a long way. I hope you watch it and agree.",Halloween II
20,lastliberal,I shot him 6 times! I shot him in the heart-but... HE'S NOT HUMAN!,6,3 August 2008,"May this should have been Halloween Continued as it is part of the first film with the story continuing to it's horrible conclusion.Donald Pleasence was definitely the star of this film as he appeared in almost every scene except in the hospital, where the carnage was continuing without anyone's notice. The therapy session was particularly gruesome, and a complete waste of Pamela Susan Shoop in her only topless role. What is it with these slashers? Did they all take a vow of celibacy? This was a methodical stalking of Michael Myers as he had only one objective in mind, and was determined that no one would get in his path. I counted about 13 victims - an interesting number for Halloween.",Halloween II
21,zardoz-13,Shallow Slasher Sequel Lacks Any Surprises,4,27 August 2009,"The sequel to John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" doesn't surpass the original. Freshman director Rick Rosenthal creates only a handful of suspenseful moments, but ""Halloween 2"" suffers from a weak script that was unfortunately penned by Carpenter and co-producer Hill. Michael Myers gets up and walks away after Dr. Loomis bangs off six shots into him. We never learn what makes Michael such an unstoppable demon. In ""Halloween,"" Michael embodied a supernatural evil, but in ""Halloween 2"" doesn't develop his character. No matter how many times people pump bullets into the guy, he just doesn't stay down for the count. The problem is Rosenthal's comatose direction. This chiller generates a body count but it doesn't generate horror. Instead, it becomes monotonous with Michael trudging into and out of scenes like a wraith. The action picks up where it left off in ""Halloween."" Michael plunges into the yard, hard enough to leave an impression of his body, after Loomis opens fire on him. When Loomis goes to confirm his kill, he realizes to his horror that Michael has gotten up and vanished. Meanwhile, the paramedics haul Laurie off to the hospital. Futilely she pleads with them not to give her anything that will put her to sleep. Of course, the doctor ignores her request and administers an injection designed to knock her out. Although Laurie is deadly afraid of Michael and what he is capable of doing to her, ""Halloween 2"" doesn't develop a strong sense of fear. The best scene finds a hospital guard investigating noises. When he opens a cabinet, an avalanche of items topples onto him. When he turns around, Michael is there waiting for him. Earlier, the guard had spotted blood in a trash dumpster and a shrieking black cat flew out at him. Everything else unfolds in a matter of fact fashion. Of course, ""Halloween 2"" is just a mindless horror movie, but the idiocy gets out of hand. The movie lacks a sense of humor, much less a sense of irony. Michael himself doesn't speak, but he seems to know exactly what to do in every given situation and where to go. You cannot fool this bogyman. Sometimes, like in the hydro-therapy, you have to wonder if Carpenter and Hill aren't going a bit off the deep end. I mean, Michael holds the poor nurse's head under the scalding water, but the scorching water exerts no visible effect on him. When he casts the nurse aside, her face looks hideous. If this is supposed to show that Michael is invulnerable himself, then you have to wonder why Carpenter and Hill behave so inconsistently. Later, in the final confrontation in the hospital, Loomis blasts Michael multiple times again but the guy gets back up. Finally, when Laurie—who shouldn't even be able to climb out of bed—blows Michael's eyeballs out, the guy begins to behave like he is mortal. Clearly, Loomis should have shot Michael's feet to ribbons so that he couldn't walk. Imagine how much blood that this guy has lost after being shot—twelve times—but he displays virtually no signs of slowing down.Michael Myers is the equivalent of a Steven Seagal hero. He is indestructible until Loomis sacrifices his own life in the hospital and incinerates him. The end credits show us Michael burning to a crisp. The other thing that bothered me about this mute murderer who escaped from the asylum is his innovative ways of killing people. He stabs a surgeon in the eyeball with a pair of scissors. He buries a claw hammer into the guard's head. He drains the blood from a nurse. He guts another nurse on a scalpel and then hoists her so high in the air that her shoes fall out. Michael acts like he is a scenarist's puppet, killing people in imaginative ways rather than with his brute strength and knife. Another problem with ""Halloween 2"" is the way that Rosenthal force feeds us exposition. The entire scene in the back of the sheriff's cruiser when the nurse informs Loomis that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is really Michael's baby sister and all the stuff about the sealed records struck me as too contrived and obvious. Mind you, I know that this is supposed to be a different kind of horror movie with an impervious killer, but there is just no excitement. It looks slick when the nurse's boyfriend is killed behind the marbled glass in the hydro-therapy and it is neat when the nurse believes that Michael is her boyfriend, but afterward things go flat with Michael drowning her. The idea that Michael can stroll around unnoticed and people can bump into him without recognizing him seems contradictory. We are never told why Michael decides to kill who he does and then ignores everybody else. ""Halloween 2"" does something different in that there are no teenagers getting naked and then dying at Michael's hands. The idea that a hospital would be as deserted as the hospital in the movie seems far-fetched. Neither Carpenter & Hill nor Rosenthal make any of the victims look sympathetic. Michael seems far too clever to be doing what he gets away with. ""Halloween 2"" is predictable because we know Michael cannot be killed in an ordinary way, but it is also predictable because we know that his victims will die horribly but pose little threat to him. Altogether, ""Halloween 2"" has all the dramatic impact of a flat-line on a heart monitor. The dialogue is strictly expository with nothing in the way of memorable or quotable lines. Indeed, Michael here is such an inexorable source of evil that he is neither interesting nor intimidating. He emerges as a one-dimensional character that you don't care about any more than you sympathizes his cardboard victims. ""Halloween 2"" qualifies as an exercise in nihilism.",Halloween II
22,Boba_Fett1138,Simply great within it's genre.,8,5 September 2009,"Being a sequel, this movie always had been a bit underrated. Fact simply remains that this is a more than worthy sequel, that above all things is a great movie within its genre.The first ""Halloween"" from 1978 sort of formed and established the modern slasher-genre. This movie expands this even more by featuring some of the more commonly known modern slasher elements in it. Bascily it's a movie about a killer maniac who is on a killing spree, set for most part in an hospital this time. You can say that this movie is less horror than ""Halloween"" was but is more slasher-like.What I also love about this movie is that it right sets off after the events of the first movie. Movies often attempt this but it doesn't always work out that well, due to a difference in approach and atmosphere for instance. ""Halloween II"" perfectly blends in with its predecessor and it's made believable that the evens in this movie all take place during the same night as the events the first one, even though the movie got made 3 years later.Because it takes place during the same night, it also means that the surviving characters from the first movie make their appearance once more in this one, though for some reason Jamie Lee Curtis' character is pushed to the background a bit due to the fact that also new characters get introduced and Donald Pleasance's his role is also bigger this time.As a genre movie it simply is a great and effective one. It has some nice moments in it that make the genre so great and always effective to watch, when done right. There are some nice gory moments as well, which were apparently added by John Carpenter himself, after the original shot version got considered to 'tame' by him. He didn't fully directed this movie this time but he still was very much involved with the process as a writer and producer of the movie.A great watch for the lovers of the genre and a worthy first sequel to John Carpenter's ""Halloween"".8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Halloween II
23,Calicodreamin,The evening after,6,27 October 2021,"Halloween II picks up about five minutes of the original film and keeps rolling. The storyline is much of the same, but loses the high intensity and vibe from the first film. Laurie is down and out for the majority of the film and acts like a total idiot for the rest of her part. Myers is taking run of an empty hospital that apparently only has one patient. Kind of lame, but still a few cool slasher kills.",Halloween II
24,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"More of the night, less of the good",6,30 January 2010,"In a way, it isn't fair to compare this to the original. The studio demanded a sequel, and the first was not an easy act to follow. The two writers return(they were probably under contract), and here answer questions that were posed and should have remained mysteries, and turn this into a fairly straightforward slasher flick. You couldn't have repeated the approach of only real film in this series... the gradual build-up and reveal of Myers, culminating in that perfect ending and climax. There are countless reasons not to continue with that same story, and John knew; with the third one, he got to do what he always intended with the series, meaning, a new concept for each one. It only lasted a single one, because audiences wanted Michael, instead. I have to wonder why he behaves so much like a cave-man at points, in this. As well as why the *beautifully* done and immensely effective theme is ruined(did they play it on a synthesizer? What the hell did they do? It sounds awful), why they now use Sandman(hey, I like it, too, but for *this*?), why the subtlety was thrown out the window, and I could go on. I mean, I'm being(trying to be, at least) as forthcoming with this as with any horror movie; this is frankly just not that well-done. MM is shown in a full-body shot near the very beginning, and they assign a POV shot to him, which means that every time the camera moves as if someone is looking, you instantly know where he is and where he's going. That was consistently and intentionally avoided before this one. Can you guess why? It kills the suspense instantly. You'd have to close your eyes during those sequences to not know where he is. This is also noticeably poorly lit, so you can't always tell what is going on, not a problem before in these. There is little to no atmosphere in this, and since it isn't for a lack of trying, I'm chalking it up to Rosenthal not having the skill to pull it off. The cinematography and editing are simply not impressive; even the opening credits are dull, and a waste of a great idea. This doesn't engage at any time. The characters are all either painfully bland or utterly obnoxious(so it's tough to work up sympathy when they die), and that includes Loomis, who went from high-strung to an irritating, bitter and constantly yammering old dude. That's another thing; the acting. It's really bad. You know you're in trouble when Pleasance is over the top. The dialog varies. To an extent, the script feels like one of Carpenter's efforts, if not one of the best; it's the talentless execution that really mars it. Though the effects can be nice enough, a lot of the time, they're merely passable(yes, that is if you take into account when this was made). There is plenty of bloody, gory violence, a bit of disturbing content, infrequent moderate to strong language and relatively brief, gratuitous nudity, both genders. I recommend this solely to those who *need* a second outing. 6/10",Halloween II
25,view_and_review,Michael Owns Halloween,8,4 July 2019,"Still the best scary movie musical chord ever. Still the most unhurried killer ever. Add to that one of the best scary movie lines ever.The movie began by showing the conclusion of the first ""Halloween."" Dr. Loomis is outside looking around for Michael when a neighbor emerges (finally) to inquire about what's going on. The neighbor says, ""Is this some kind of joke? I've been trick-or-treated to death tonight.""To which Dr. Loomis replies, ""You don't know what death is.""Oooooh wee. So cold. So true.H2 was released 3 years after the first one but it's a continuation of the same night, October 31st, 1978. The action moves away from the sleepy Haddonfield neighborhood to the sleepy Haddonfield Memorial Hospital where Laurie has been taken. Laurie is like a beacon for Michael. Apparently she gives off this pheromone that attracts him no matter where she is.And Michael Myers is stuff of legend. Yeah, Tupac was shot five times and lived; Michael took six shots. As Dr. Loomis so aptly put it, ""He's not human!""But I think the city of Haddonfield, Illinois has had enough. At this rate Michael will wipe out the entire town before the next Halloween. Haddonfield should wave the white flag and give in to his demands. Michael owns Haddonfield. He owns Halloween.",Halloween II
26,AlsExGal,Sequel to the hit 1978 film picks up right where the first left off...,6,19 March 2021,"...with Laurie Strode having survived the attacks of the seemingly supernatural Michael Meyers. Laurie is taken to the hospital to treat her minor wounds, and that's where the majority of the film takes place, as the still-murderous Michael cuts through neighborhoods and eventually hospital staff in his unstoppable quest to murder Laurie. The ever vigilant Dr. Loomis is still on the hunt for Michael, and it becomes a question of who gets their prey first.Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie, and does well, although she stays in a state of shock through a lot of the film. Donald Pleasence also returns to his most iconic role, the implacable Dr. Loomis. Look quickly for Dana Carvey as a reporter wearing a trucker cap. John Carpenter and Debra Hill return as writers and producers, although directing duties were ceded to Rick Rosenthal. Carpenter and his frequent collaborator Alan Howarth composed and performed the terrific score. Dean Cundey provides some of the best widescreen cinematography seen in horror films of the era.The movie maintains a good feeling of suspense throughout, although efforts to flesh out the Meyers character aren't needed and subtract from the enigmatic mood of the first film. Some of the deaths are also more grisly, in an attempt, I assume, to keep up with the slasher competition. Despite these minor drawbacks, the film is still good, and recommended for suspense and horror fans.",Halloween II
27,Uriah43,Every Bit as Good as Its Predecessor,7,21 April 2015,"This movie essentially begins where its predecessor left off with ""Michael Myers"" (Tony Moran) being shot six times and falling from a two-story house onto the ground below. When ""Dr. Sam Loomis"" (Donald Pleasance) goes to the window to view the body he is shocked to see that it is no longer there. It's at this point that the movie continues with ""Laurie Strode"" (Jamie Lee Curtis) being taken to Haddonfield Medical Hospital to have her wounds treated while the people in the town begin to learn of the devastation brought on by the inhuman monster who now roams the streets. Unfortunately for Laurie, upon hearing that she has been taken to the hospital, the danger to her and everyone else there is about to become all too real. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I would just like to say that I thought this movie was every bit as good as its predecessor. If anything, it was movies like this--along with the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchises-- which were instrumental in defining the identity of horror films for the entire decade. Be that as it may, this movie still manages to entertain fairly well even after 30 years or so. Likewise the presence of some very cute nurses like Pamela Susan Shoop (as ""Karen""), Tawny Moyer (""Jill"") and Ana Alicia (""Janet"") certainly doesn't hurt either. Above average.",Halloween II
28,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"The best of the sequels, and a great movie as well",10,30 November 2012,"Having escaped the wrath of Michael and taken to a hospital to recover, the lone survivor of his previous rampage finds herself unaware of the fact that he has followed here there and begins a blood-soaked rampage to get her.This here is one of the biggest and best of the sequels to the original and manages to come across as one of the better films in the genre for this reason. This is highlighted by the fact that this one really ups the body count and offers far more kills than expected as it manages to knock off the crew of the hospital first before going after the main victim, and that allows for more blood and gore than the original, which admittedly didn't have much, but this one blows it away with a ton of gruesome deaths. As well, this one contains a large amount of creepy stalking scenes that are far more suspenseful than expected, including two which rip-off the original but still manage to generate a jolt at the time. Following this, there's some high-energy action scenes of her trying to get away, and the drugged-up nature of the character trying to get away allows for even more suspense to be generated during the finale where it's a long, drawn-out chase around the depths of the hospital before getting to the main level again for an action-packed showdown, which ends the movie nicely. While it does have some incredulous moments as the connections are being made that really stretch the boundaries of understanding and a wasted starring role, this is still one of the better entries in the series.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and Nudity.",Halloween II
29,AaronCapenBanner,First Of Many Sequels.,3,12 September 2013,"John Carpenter wrote,but did not return as director of this inevitable sequel to the smash hit original. Story picks up moments after the first film ends, with Michael Myers still on the loose, though now pursuing survivor Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) to the hospital she was admitted to(she has various injuries, not to mention being in a state of shock!) Naturally, Michael starts killing the hospital staff on this tragic Halloween night, though doggedly pursued by his psychiatrist Sam Loomis(Donald Pleasance, the film's highlight) who is determined to stop Myers, no matter the cost.Despite some interesting story turns involving Michael & Laurie, this is a most disappointing, inferior sequel, that has little of the suspense or style of the first, and relies far too much on graphic violence, rather than the palpable dread of the original. Only works when Donald Pleasance is on screen, though does have a memorable climax.",Halloween II
30,FlashCallahan,Janet!!! Get me more coffee......,5,28 October 2016,"In this sequel which is mouthing more than a blatant cash in on the new found success of the slasher film thanks to the original groundbreaking film, we find Sheriff Brackett and Dr. Loomis continuing their hunt for Michael Myers, while a traumatised Laurie is rushed to hospital.But it isn't long before Michael makes his way to the hospital, and the killing spree continues..The original film was a revelation, starting a new era in the horror genre. For some, it was year zero for the horror film, and starting a new trend in a sub genre.Yes, the film spawned literally dozens of imitations, but this is because the film was so fresh, spawning so many great ideas, and using some camera techniques that still dazzle and make the film sometimes very uncomfortable to watch.This film however, just follows the cookie cutter process of the imitations Halloween spawned, and goes for your atypical stalk n' slash movie, but with the added bonus of having such a cult character as the antagonist.And it's a crying shame, because in continuing from the very moment where the first one ended, it tarnishes the original ever so slightly.The majority of the original cast are back, but they look bored, and instead of appearing to be in peril, they just appear to be hanging around waiting for that killer stroke.If the film had more original ideas, rather than following a tired formula, this could have been a stand out horror film.Instead, it's just serviceable stuff.",Halloween II

The first sequel to ""Halloween"", while not as good as the first, nor in my mind the great forth film, is still very tense, thrilling and worth watching for any fan of slasher films. The only three ""halloween"" films that hold up to repeat viewing by, by the way, are the original (naturally), this, and Part 4 (the third had nothing to do with Myers at all, the less said of that film the better) My Grade: B- DVD Extras: Production Notes; Cast & Crew Filmographies; and Theatrical Trailer",Halloween II

I prefer the third movie which has nothing to do with him to all the mess that follows.  This movie is a continuation of the first as it is still the same night.  Myers has of course gotten up and Jamie Lee has been taken to a hospital to recuperate from her wounds.  Of course this one tries to shock us with its revelations and such, but nothing to shocking.  There are kills and once again Dr. Loomis is obsessed with getting Myers.  Some good kills are to be found as is to be expected.  Though I always feel sorry for the guy that gets hit by the car as he is obviously not Myers.  There is a television version of this one that totally blows as it is very toned down and they even have a happier ending.  Watch the uncut theater version as it is much better.",Halloween II
33,The_Void,More Halloween...,8,13 September 2005,"I don't rate the original Halloween very highly, so quite why I keep seeing the sequels is anyone's guess. This sequel, however, is definitely the best of the bunch and I would even go as far as to say that I like part 2 slightly more than the original film. The original bored me because a lot of the running time was spent on building the story (which was neither interesting nor original) and Michael Myers 'stalking' people. This time, we get thrust straight into the film - and although it still isn't that great, at least most of the running time isn't spent waiting around. This film's major talking point is the fact that the story takes place immediately after the events of the first film. Most sequels pick up some time later, but the fact that this one picks up where we left off is good because it allows the audience to get straight back into it, and is also slightly fascinating in a ""what happens next"" kind of a way. As you might expect, the story is wafer thin and it follows boring serial killer Michael as he slashes his way through town in search of Lawrie Strode, from the first film.John Carpenter didn't direct this film, and that can only be a good thing. Rick Rosenthal steps into his shoes and creates the same atmosphere as the first film, only without the egotistical score soaking that John Carpenter does with all of his films. Jamie Lee Curtis steps back into her role from the original and is given practically nothing to do once again. It's really hard to care for the victim when they have no character at all - no wonder Myers wanted rid of her! Also reprising his role as Myers' doctor and biggest fan is Donald Pleasance, and like he would go on to do in 'The Return of Michael Myers', spends a lot of the running time bigging up his dull mental patient. Of the big three slasher series', Halloween is definitely the worst and a lot of the reason for that is because of the serial killer. Some people think that the emotionless way that Michael stalks his victims is frightening, but I only found it boring. Myers represents a distinct lack of imagination on the parts of writers John Carpenter and Debra Hill, and I won't be joining in on the pretence that he's anything but dull. On the whole, if you like the first one; you'll like this. If you didn't, there's no point in seeing any of the sequels.",Halloween II
34,trashgang,it's time Michael,8,15 November 2011,"Rick Rosenthal, the director is the only director that was involved in two flicks into the franchise. This one and Halloween Resurrection although it is said that John Carpenter was ghost directing. nevertheless, I liked it.It picks up were part one ended, it even goes a bit back into the end of part one so if you haven't seen it you can pick up part two without a problem. The cast was the same as in the original, Jamie Lee Curtis was back as did Donald Pleasence. The only difference is that here we do have a lot more nudity and red stuff. The funny thing is that in part one we had The Thing from 1951 on television, here we had Night Of The Living Dead. But to go back on the horror, the killings are all done in front of the camera and the red stuff do flows a lot. It isn't really gory but the tub scene is for some easily offended a bit too much. On the other hand there's an explanation why Michael is trying to kill Laurie Strode. The acting is excellent again by all and Michael is still believable even as he became some kind of supernatural killer. it's funny to see the endings in all those franchises like Friday and Halloween, the killer is always dead but due the success he reanimate in the next part. I liked it and I thought it wasn't a bad follow-up.Gore 3/5 Nudity 2/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Halloween II

36,Smells_Like_Cheese,A creepy and solid sequel,7,10 February 2004,"Michael Myers, he's a household name, in my opinion he's the ultimate boogeyman, no matter what you do or how many times you try to kill him, he just comes back. Hence the Halloween series. We do have quite a bit of horror movie sequels: the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, Friday the 13th, Hellraiser, Scream, and so on. Most sequels are extremely cheesy and don't deliver the same scares as the original movie does, but the Halloween franchise is a different story, I think these sequels were always a ton of fun and delivered just as many scares. Nothing will ever compare to the original Halloween, but it was cool to see the story continue on Michael Myers. In this story we follow Laurie Strode to the hospital and Michael doesn't just give up that easily, he's on a mission.After the film replays the last scene of Halloween, it moves on to Dr. Sam Loomis warning Sheriff Leigh Brackett that although he has shot Myers six times in the heart, Myers still lives. Meanwhile, Laurie Strode is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital and Myers wanders around Haddonfield in search of her. Laurie is informed that the man who attacked her was Michael Myers, infamous for murdering his older sister fifteen years earlier on Halloween night. After this, Laurie drifts in and out of consciousness, having strange flashbacks about her adoption by the Strodes and visiting a boy in an institution. Myers learns that she is at the hospital. He goes there and murders the hospital's staff one by one. Laurie manages to elude him, but she is limping badly and sedated and is thus unable to move very quickly. Dr. Loomis and the Haddonfield police continue to search the town for Myers. Nurse Marion Chambers, Loomis' assistant, arrives and tells Loomis that she has discovered a secret file on Myers to which he was not privy. The file reveals that Laurie is actually Myers's sister, adopted by the Strodes after Myers killed his older sister, Judith. Chambers also informs Loomis that he has strict orders to return to Smith's Grove. So they have to get back to the hospital to save Laurie before Michael can get to her.Halloween 2 is probably my second favorite sequel in the Halloween franchise next to H20. I can't tell you how creepy this movie was, I know that these sequels are a bit much, but for any horror movie fan, they are a ton of fun to get into. The whole hospital setting was really scary, I love Laurie Strode, she's the strongest female in a horror movie, she's in a weakened state but just keeps going. You have to love the return of Dr. Loomis, him helping Laurie and making sure that Michael goes away for good, well we clearly know that it's not going to happen, but you have to give him credit for his optimism. If you are going to watch a Halloween sequel, I do recommend Halloween 2, it's very creepy and a great addition to the story.7/10",Halloween II
37,Rainey-Dawn,A Good Continuation,10,3 July 2014,"Halloween II (1981) is a good continuation to the first film. It picks up exactly where Halloween (1978) left off. So these two movies make a perfect back to back double feature - particularly on All Hallows' Eve.Just like the first movie, the story is a well written thriller that will keep you looking over your shoulder then back at the screen. The second film has all the intensity, chills, suspense and horror of the first in the series.Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981) both have an A+ horror factor without showing too much of the blood and violence on screen... that is what keeps up the suspense during the films; they show just enough to keep the mystery alive in the movies.10/10",Halloween II

40,sddavis63,Good Job Following Up The Best Slasher Movie Ever Made,7,23 October 2010,"This movie had a tough act to follow. ""Halloween"" is the quintessential ""slasher"" movie - and probably still the best of the bunch by far. In some ways ""Halloween II"" struggled at times to live up to the standards set by its predecessor, but in the end still managed to do a pretty good job while still giving the industry an example to follow which the industry - unfortunately - chose largely not to follow.The events in this sequel all take place on one night - Halloween night 1978. It picks up right where ""Halloween"" left off, just as Dr. Loomis (again a brilliantly believable performance by Donald Pleasance) fires six bullets into Michael Myers after his attack on Laurie (again played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Here we see the beginning of a tradition in this kind of movie: Michael Myers becomes the evil that won't die. After taking six bullets he gets up and walks away, to wreak havoc and terror on Haddonfield, Illinois for the rest of the night, all the while searching for Laurie. There's a lot more violence in this one than in the original, which depended more on atmosphere and suspense, with the violence in that one being largely contained in the last half hour or so of the movie. The violence is also more graphic than in the original, although pretty tame compared to later examples of the slasher genre. Suspense isn't lacking. There's good use of the concept of ""The Shape"" as Michael Myers is referred to in the credits; eerie semi-glances at him as he stalks his next victim. Pleasance, as noted, was great. Jamie Lee Curtis was I thought underused - although Laurie was the focus of Michael's rage. Through most of the film she simply lay in a hospital bed recovering from the wounds she suffered at the end of the first movie. Most of her ""acting"" took place late in the movie, her performance being (I thought) somewhat stronger than in the first, where she came across to me at times as surprisingly wooden and unemotional. She had obviously matured as an actress in the intervening three years, and it was unfortunate that her performance wasn't more central to the story.Two plot points were problematic to me - one minor and one significant. The minor point first. Obviously to create suspense, a decision was made to make sure that none of the characters ever turned on the lights in a dark room when they entered it. Over and over characters seemed to enter dark spaces that looked as if they should have had a light switch somewhere nearby (like the nurse who entered the office of the doctor she was looking for) but never bothered to turn it on. Odd the things you notice, but that bugged me. The major plot problem for me though was the use of an anachronism. In the first movie there was really no sense that Laurie was the centre of Michael Myers' attention. He seemed just out to kill and if she hadn't gone over to the house where the killing was happening there was nothing in the movie that suggested Michael would have searched her out. Then, here, lying on the bed in the hospital, Laurie whispers in bewilderment ""why me?"" as if she saw herself as the main object in Myers' game of murder. I realize that for the sequel that was the case, but it seemed to me to be inconsistent with the first and I couldn't see any reason in particular that Laurie would have seen herself as anything more than another of Michael Myers' victims.Still, this was good and suspenseful and a whole lot better than most of the sequels that followed (not only the subsequent ""Halloween"" sequels, but sequels and even originals of the other slasher series that followed it.)",Halloween II
41,thesar-2,The Nightmare Isn't Over--for fans of #1,2,21 August 2009,"Let's get the positive out of the way for the 1981 'Halloween II': a few, just a few, suspenseful scenes and kills, it had a nice idea of starting immediately as #1 ended and it gave 'Mr. Sandman' a very creepy overhaul – every time I've heard it since, I think of this movie. OK, well, I think I've given this junk more than it's worth of praise. There has to be a 5-to-1 ratio of bad to good. This updated ""disco-type"" soundtrack is not only an awful tribute to Carpenter's creepy and effective original score, it's enormously distracting, causing each scene it appears to lose its fright. Michael seems to spend more time transporting (in one scene he's near his destination, the clinic/hospital, the next he's in a car he magically and unnecessarily appears in a nurse's backseat) and killing at random – taking away from his character in #1. Loomis spends endless minutes in endless forgettable and boring speeches and actually leads, unrepentantly, an innocent to his death. And Laurie looks years older (the Michael J. Fox syndrome) though she plays a teenager and is completely wasted for character and Curtis' talent. The movie that continues Michael's plight in killing Laurie one Halloween night in a hospital was so bad, I'm ashamed it came after such a masterpiece #1 was. And as bad as the others were, this one had the highest of expectations. Too many to list, but here's the highlights on the worst parts: Michael's now a doctor who can perform medical kills, a clichéd cowboy with a boom-box who listens tothe news?, you can shoot someone in the eyes and luckily the bullets stop at the eyeballs, hospitals don't have a sprinkler system and it shamelessly promotes horny targets and plot-twist clichés. Avoid & jump to 'H20.'",Halloween II
42,gridoon,Strictly by-the-numbers.,5,5 October 1999,"Strictly by-the-numbers, occasionally boring sequel to ""Halloween"". The main element of suspense here is represented by the question ""what kind of weapon is Myers going to use for his next murder?"", but you never really see anything you haven't seen before.Even with two fair chase scenes, ""Halloween II"" is standard stuff. However, Pleasence is energetic and enjoyable in his role and the music (the movie's biggest asset, and possibly the original's biggest asset, too) is as chilling as ever.",Halloween II
43,lost-in-limbo,The Night he Came back home Part 2,7,15 October 2008,"The second instalment sees the film begin where the original left off. Michael has survived the gunshots and balcony fall to hide out within the suburban neighbourhood of a quite town Haddonfield, until he realizes that Laurie is being kept at the local hospital. On his trail are Dr. Loomis and the local police force. Just like sequels do, it's nothing more than a basic slash n stalk set-up (although director Rick Rosenthal does a slickly well-paced job) with more jarring violence (plenty of blood on this occasion) and nastiness replacing genuine and growing suspense in tight quarters. Even though it's set a secluded, dingy hospital that breathes gloomy unease. However the claustrophobic setting never squeezes the situation all that tight. The plastered shocks are telegraphed, as it has the usual distant background figure (Michael Myers) with his initial victims unaware of his lurking presence. Dean Cundey's fluid camera-work masterfully moves around the screen with atmospheric verve and intent. The framing is spot on. God love those POV shots and the heavy breathing along with it. It looks like there's a little more money behind it and Debra Hill and John Carpenter produced it. Again they also feature as the writers of this entry and while keeping it straight-forward (with some contrived developments) they go on to spend a little more time on Michael Myers' history. Donald Pleasance enthusiastically gives it his all in his bombastic portrayal as Dr. Loomis. I could listen to Pleasance ramble (which does here) on all day about the evil that's Michael Myers. Another treat for the ears was that Carpenter's hauntingly nerve-wreaking score (from the original) is kind of recycled for this outing. The cast for 'Halloween II' is potently strong. Jamie Lee Curtis returns but seems more like a placidly vacant shell of vulnerability, but it's a likable turn and really there's no other Laurie Strode. Lance Guest is good and Charles Cyphers is sound in his minor showing. There's fun support by Leo Rossi, Jeffrey Kramer, Ford Rainey and Pamela Susan Shoop. A solidly dark sequel, which is worthy of it's groundbreaking original.",Halloween II
44,ThomasDrufke,Fails to Recapture the Spirit of the First,6,1 November 2017,"The first Halloween is one of the best Horror films of all time, and easily the best film centered around the holiday of Halloween. Halloween II, taking place on the same night, attempts to essentially recreate the magic of the original, but without the focus or sharp execution.Picking up directly after Michael Myers falls out of the window and to ""his death"", the divisive sequel is in large part the same plot as the 1978 original. Myers is on the loose, seemingly won't die, and is on a killing rampage for no good reason. Interestingly enough, there's even less method to his madness this time around, which is typically where the film fails. There was something about watching Myers go around killing sex-obsessed teenagers, and specifically Laurie Strode's friends, that made the first film so intense and more personal. But with Laurie spending most of the film in a hospital bed, there's a lack of emotional connection.That's not to say Myers doesn't have his frightening moments. In fact, the new ways Myers chooses to kill his victims was pretty creative, and luckily just gruesome enough to send chills up and down your spine (but not too gruesome where you feel like turning the movie off). We still have the first person camera movement and well edited cuts to legitimize the kills and keep a sense of reality to the situation. It's in these moments that I feel the film solidifies itself even if it doesn't nearly have the impact the first did.There is one particular third act twist/reveal that I'm sure ticked off fans of the franchise at the time, and I found it to be quite a reach as well. There's always a way to build mythology without overdoing the reasoning behind Myers' crimes and exploiting them. To me, Halloween II is a worthy horror film, but not nearly satisfying enough as a sequel to feature the main two characters from the original. Why not use Jamie Lee Curtis a little more?6.8/10",Halloween II
45,Cineanalyst,The Bogeyman Strikes Back,6,6 December 2019,"The first ""Halloween"" is elegant in its simplicity; these sequels seem to do little else but muddy it up. At least, in this one, there remains some of the association of the camera's gaze with that of Michael Myers--placing the spectator in the unnerving position of identifying with the murderous monster through a series of point-of-view shots. The pull between Michael and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) for control of the gaze is absent for much of the picture, as Laurie recovers from the last go around. Security cameras unseen by any character stand in as counter shots for much of his movements until Laurie gets on her feet again. The eventual confrontation, however, between Laurie and Michael includes a novel solution to the conflict. In the last film, Laurie overcame him by nearly removing his mask and, thus, exposing his face to the camera's gaze. This time, she shoots him in the eyes--definitively removing his ability to control what we see through the shared eye of the camera.Otherwise, this is a flawed sequel. There's a genetic plot twist straight out of ripping off last year's ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980), which allegedly John Carpenter came up with in an inebriated state to solve the problem of adding more scenes to the 1978 film for its TV broadcasts (the inadequate runtime being a result of the gorier stuff being cut) and which is recycled here. Moving Michael's killing spree to a hospital also has the dubious benefit of a series of sexcaspades involving nurses and one pesky paramedic hitting on Laurie while she recovers from the trauma of almost being murdered a short while ago. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis goes to school to add some mumbo-jumbo background mythology to Myers' bogeyman, which, I guess, is reflected in the fiery climax. Something to do with Celts supposedly burning people, and the doc and the maniac both knowing and referencing the Gaelic festival of ""Samhain,"" implausible and inconsequential though it may be. To make things worse, Carpenter's original iconic score is made grating by sending it through a synthesizer, and whooshing sound effects are ridiculously added to Michael's arm and knife waving. I mean, cut it out, he's not holding a lightsaber, for crying out loud.",Halloween II
46,ericstevenson,"Well, I liked it",7,3 October 2017,"I guess the original ""Halloween"" movie would be a tough act to follow, but this was a pretty good little flick. It continues right where the previous film left off as we continue to see Michael Myers' body count rise. There's an important revelation in this. Laurie is revealed to be another one of Michael's sisters who was adopted in her youth which is why Michael is after her. Dr. Loomis is once again featured. When you have a villain who doesn't talk, you really do have to give characterization to the good guys and that's what these movies do.It's even treated more realistically as they actually get help from the police. Of course, they're still pretty useless. Dr. Loomis talks about how Michael is unstoppable hinting at his supernatural powers which will be expanded upon later. Actually, that didn't work out too well. Michael is just as intimidating as he was in the first movie. Second only to Jason Voorhees, he has the most kills of any slasher movie villain. Call me morbid, but some of these kills are pretty creative. ***",Halloween II
47,cricketbat,A bunch of butcher knife fodder instead of characters,5,9 October 2021,"What's interesting about Halloween II is that it takes place immediately after the events of the first film. What's not interesting is the rest of the movie. Instead of giving us characters we care about, it just gives us a bunch of butcher knife fodder. And the only person we are really interested in (Laurie) spends most of the movie sedated. This movie is more gruesome than scary, and it turns Michael Myers into a magical being rather than a silent stalker. This sequel definitely suffers from the sophomore slump.",Halloween II
48,lesleyharris30,"An Enjoyable Scare, but Pales in Comparison to its Predecessor,",7,5 October 2019,"Halloween II is a good movie with a well developed plot and a talented cast. It is an enjoyable scare and fans of horror will certainly get a good kick out of it. I find Michael Myers, personally, to be very enjoyable as a Horror figure, he is chilling in a very intriguing way, moving slowly, he scares quite subtly, but it makes him more interesting than a typical straight up terrifying horror character.While it does fine on its own, you will be deflated watching it considering that you will not be able to not make comparisons to the original Halloween, and it is quite a mediocre sequel. It is not half as original, nor is it anywhere near as thrilling as Halloween, and tries so hard to do what the previous film did so well that it becomes a pale imitation.Jamie Lee Curtis and Donal Pleasence save this movie, and are also too good to be in it really. They are both bursting with life, energy and are both clearly still happy to be playing the characters of Laurie and Dr. Sam Loomis, they make it watchable with their dynamic chemistry make it worthwhile.Run of the mill horror, but enjoyable. Scary and quick, Halloween II does nothing groundbreaking, but it is a fun watch for horror junkies.
Michael Myers is still on the run, Laurie and Dr. Loomis must stop at nothing to find him before he gets his next victim.
Best Performance: Donald Pleasence",Halloween II
49,CuriosityKilledShawn,Already falling into tedium,5,16 January 2005,"When it comes to keeping a consistent plot the Halloween series has been the absolute worst. 1 and 2 follow each other okay, 3 is the joker in the pack, Return, Revenge and Curse were nothing but gibberish and H20 and Resurrection have been poor 'post-modern' exercises in convention merely using the Halloween name.Right after the original Halloween ended, Laurie is taken away to get stitched up, but Michael Myers ain't quite dead yet. Much of this bore is set in a hospital as he very, very slowly goes about his killing machine business. Donald Pleasence does his mad doctor bit again spouting some crackpot dialogue in a strange, offbeat way. No one listens to him, of course and they end up dead.It's an okay sequel but it's marred by unbearable slowness. The pace for that particular night was already set by the first film so why slow down and build up again? Regarded as a classic far too often the first film is somewhat obsolete today. But it does have one purpose: to always look good when compared to the drek of 'horror' we suffer today. This first sequel, coming a mere three years after the original, already looks tired and the thin premise is stretched to breaking point. There's no purity or class here.Plus it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. What happened to Jimmy? He died by gently banging his head but didn't keel over until 20 minutes later? What? Why do the credits list someone playing Michael Myers (Age 23) when he is only 21 in the film and is played by Dick Warlock? Why did he kill the Sheriff's daughter (which he does again in Revenge)? This new DVD from Universal improves upon the cruddy Goodtimes release by giving us a new 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and a sturdy keepcase instead of a horrid snapper. The sound is in not-bad-for-its-day Dolby Stereo. There are no features to speak of, which is annoying since Universal originally promised us commentaries, documentaries, deleted scenes etc. Pick it up cheap.",Halloween II

The first half of the movie was extremely boring to me, and I carried the idea of giving up. The other half justified the patience. The movie becomes very tense and I think that it owes its frightening effect primarily to sound and music. There are some really top cadres, and my favorite scene was the attempt of bathtub sex in the therapy room, not only because of the only nudity in the movie, but also because of the powerful atmosphere. This time the murders are more diverse and very well shot, and the finale is explosive. Overall, this is an average '80s horror flick, but slightly better than the original.6/10",Halloween II

Acting wasn't anything to write home about, and everything else in this movie were just OK, but sadly nothing more. What i did like were a few long take scenes, and also pacing of this movie is not bad - at running time 1 h 30 it wasn't boring.Overall, if you compare to first movie - it is weaker in every possible way.

53,ironhorse_iv,"Halloween 2 was not as good as the original. Still, it's worth taking a stab at!",6,30 October 2015,"While stylistically, Halloween II reproduces certain key elements that made the original Halloween a success, such as first-person camera perspectives & unexceptional settings, it's still, not as good as the first movie. It was missing, a lot of great suspense and chills that made the first, watchable. It further departs from its predecessor by incorporating more graphic violence and gore, making it way too similar to other slasher films at its time. In my opinion, it went, a little too far, and became, more of a parody of its former self. The reprise horror music featured here, was awfully different from the 1st, with a more synth-heavy arrangement. Even songs like Mr. Sandman, seem out of place. Not the best composed from Alan Howarth. However, it still makes a lot of sense, that a sequel to the first movie would indeed be, made. After all, the first movie was kinda successful, plus it end in a cliff-hanger. Directed by Rick Rosenthal, the film immediately picks up where the last film had left off. After having shot, the escaped killer Michael Myers (Dick Warlock) six times, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) believes he has saved high school student, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Only to find out, that the seemingly immortal mask-man, has escape, and follow Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to a nearby hospital. Can, Dr. Loomis stop Michael Myers, once and for all or will Laurie Strode, be the latest victim of the mask-killer? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I like that the movie is set on the same night of October 31, 1978. However, it's doesn't make, much lick of sense. First off, the town of Haddonfield, acts as if there isn't a series of murders, going on. Second off, the police are not, telling people to stay at their home, or to be careful. What the hell!? I really didn't like this idiot plot. Third off, the hospital in Haddonfield seem a little too empty for a murderous Halloween night. You would think, the employees wouldn't even have, time to have sex, when dead bodies are coming in and out, throughout the night. Also, when we see a kid admitted to the hospital with the razor blade. You would think, he would, play a bigger part of the film, since the movie spent so much time on him, but no, he doesn't. He rarely mention in the third act. Is he, supposed to represented, how sadism, Halloween has come? Probably not, but if written better. He could! Honestly, this movie has a lot of a filler that rarely moves the movie along, such as the Ben Tramer subplot. Honestly, why is Ben wearing the mask? It wasn't that popular! Another is how the film, focus so much, time on the hospital employees. I really don't get, why the film does this, if they're not really, part of the main plot? You would think, this sequel written by John Carpenter, would be a lot better, but no, there is still a bit of misogyny and misandry sexual psychology terms in these types of films. The female/male nurses are played as unlikeable whores & sex hounds. Another thing, while it's highly known and accepted, now. The revelation that Laurie was Michael's sister felt a bit misguided. Some felt that the reveal took away the menacing mystery that made Michael such an effective villain, as it gave a reason for him to stalk Laurie, instead of leaving it as an unknown motive. Others felt that Michael's obsession with killing his family members gives him, a good reason to continue to kill. This is rather divided twist to this day, but for the most part, people just seem to accept it as canon as it's used again in the remake in 2007 & 2009. In my opinion, despite Laurie being Michael's sister. His randomness of killing victims is still, pretty odd. I get, why he would kill the hospital staff, but, why does, he continue to killed random people, that has nothing to do with Laurie? Honestly, I really don't get his logic, why didn't killed the old lady in the beginning, or the man with boom-box? The only thing, I can take, is that he hate people that looks attraction. It's nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis reprise her role as Laurie Strode, however, it's not as memorable as the first movie. Most of the film, has her, bed-ridden trying to recover, from her earlier attacks. It was very short. It was also nice to see Donald Pleasence in this movie, though, most of the time, he seem less, and less, a doctor, and more and more like an armed vigilante. Dick Warlock as Michael Myers was alright for the most part; but he was a bit too short for the role of the Shape. One thing, that I really can't accept, about Michael Myers in this film, is how he can seem nearly impossible to kill. It made the film, less realistic, and more supernatural. So, it doesn't make sense that Michael Myers still able to survive, being shot, multiply times. It's really getting silly, when he able to drown people in boiling hot water, and not get blister. I know the sequels to this, are much worst, when it comes to him, getting injury but come on! This movie should had stop it, from continuing. Originally, Halloween II was intended to be the last chapter of the Halloween series to revolve around Michael Myers, but after the lackluster reaction to 1982's anthology film, Halloween III: Season of the Witch, which feature a different story. The Michael Myers character was brought back in 1988's Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers in hope of recovering the film franchise. In my opinion, it never did. Overall: While, the movie might be a little dated. It's still pretty scary. It was an alright sequel.",Halloween II

55,paulclaassen,Nothing more than a slasher with little making sense.,2,7 October 2018,"For some reason John Carpenter opted not to direct this film, yet he still wrote and produced it. The film follows directly on the first film, on the same night. This means there's no slow start to the film or introduction of characters. You are plunged smack bang into the action, and that's kinda nice. Unfortunately the film spirals downwards from there, becoming nothing more than a bodycount slasher film. I understand Michael is a lunatic (and probably not human) but the killings are senseless. Characters appear simply for the sake of being sliced and diced.The film delivers cliche upon cliche and is not believable, as the first film was. I mean, Michael is just everywhere!! Killing left, right and center (for whatever reason). It felt like they conceived ideas as the film was being shot, and after editing everything doesn't gel together so nicely. The film is set almost entirely in a hospital with Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) fighting for her life again that feels very deja vu to the first film.If they managed to do the first film so well on a $300,000 budget, why did they need $2.5 million for this film? The film was still a box office success, earning ten times the budget at $25 million (but still a far cry from the original's $70 million).",Halloween II

57,zkonedog,The Only Good Sequel To The Classic Original,6,11 March 2017,"After the original ""Halloween"" film turned into the ""little independent film that could"" and ultimately set the standard for horror films for nearly two decades, John Carpenter and crew got back together in 1981 to churn out a sequel. Though the entire Halloween franchise is now mocked for the absurdity of its installments, this is the only one that manages to maintain some of the magic of the original.For a basic plot summary, ""Halloween II"" picks right up where the first one left off. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is being taken to the local hospital, while Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is still trying to hunt down the psychopathic (and seemingly indestructible) Michael Myers. When Myers finds out where Strode is being held, it sets up a final confrontation between the three.What I really have to give the ""Halloween II"" writers credit for is the foresight to realize that their shtick could only go so far. They managed to created a taut, highly-suspenseful sequel to one of the most original films of all-time, and chose to ""end"" (if only they would have known...) the series while it was still going strong.This movie succeeds because it is basically just an extension of the first. Michael is still terrifying, the jump-scenes still cause your heart to uproot, and the drama is still palpable. Does it completely capture the mojo of the 1978 edition? Not quite; but it comes closer than most horror flick ""part two's"". There is a bit more gore and a little less innocence in this installment, but overall it is a very fitting continuation of the overall storyline.Thus, watch this film with confidence knowing that you won't be let down (this time...I can't say the same for the rest of the sequels). If you're having that Halloween movie marathon on October 31st, make sure this one goes right into the DVD player after the original.",Halloween II
58,poe426,Family reunion...,7,12 March 2015,"ON SET WITH JOHN CARPENTER by Kim Gottleib-Walker brought back a lot of fond memories of the early 1980s and the First Wave of Fantasy and Horror films that began with HALLOWEEN and DAWN OF THE DEAD (and STAR WARS, of course, though it's with the Fantasy and Horror films that I'm more concerned). HALLOWEEN II was about as slick as they got, but, while Donald Pleasence had plenty to do hunting down cinema's premiere Slasher (the cinematic cousin of Norman Bates), Jamie Lee Curtis could almost literally have phoned it in. More's the pity: it was Laurie Strode who made the original so compelling (at least, to me); one couldn't help but root for her and her friends as the relentless killing machine stalked them to death. I once read an interview with John Carpenter in which he said that one idea of his was to have resumed the story years later, with Laurie living in a high rise apartment (think SOMEONE'S WATCHING ME!) when the killer returned (an idea that may have inspired HALLOWEEN H20, years later). Best of all would've been Carpenter's idea for an annual HALLOWEEN film, a la HALLOWEEN III, that ventured off in a new direction each time. (In addition to ON SET WITH JOHN CARPENTER, I also recently read THE MAKING OF GEORGE A.

59,johnnyboyz,Scary for all the wrong reasons and a film that does not hold up by todays or probably even yesteryear's standards.,4,6 November 2007,"If the first Halloween film was a clever, unnerving and dare I say unpredictable film then what is Halloween II? Halloween II feels like a dumbed-down version of Carpenter's earlier effort Assault on Precinct 13 which in itself was mediocre. This time the action is set in Haddonfield's local hospital as Laurie Strode (Lee Curtis) recovers from actions that wounded her a mere few filmic hours ago. I will agree that Halloween II feels bigger and more expansive with the film making use of its setting's long, bleak corridors and different rooms inside the hospital but everything else it does is either a copy of the first film or just isn't that good.There are times in Halloween II that make you just chuckle in disbelief; there are other times when you look away and there are other times where you just find yourself screaming at the characters on screen. Dr. Loomis (Pleasence) does exactly what he did in the first film, ie; he runs around a lot, bickers with the local authorities and seems himself a little mental at times in trying to capture Myers  he even shoots at a 17 year old kid dressed like Myers only to have him run in front of a car and get impaled on a van: what was funny here is that at the mortuary, nobody sheds a tear for the dead kid; they just resume worrying where Myers is. That is Halloween II in a nut shell: no heart, no soul.I mentioned the hospital making a good location, well it does. However; the rest of the staff must've been away trick or treating because the people that are there are not doing much apart from maybe attempting to lure one of the opposite sex members into a hospital bed; you can guess that they meet for grizzly ends because the instant you become sexually active in a horror film, a nasty fate awaits you. Halloween II by this point, though, has detached itself from the original completely in terms of camera work and use of space within the frame. In this edition, someone dies within the first five minutes and yet it took a whole forty odd minutes in the first one; instead of using brains like the first film, Halloween II would perhaps prefer to show us brains by the time it has dissolved into a messy montage showing us all the ways you can kill a person using a melee weapon: a hammer, a scalpel and a particularly nasty one involving a syringe  what a surprise, all the weapons he uses are items you can find in a hospital.The problem here is that Laurie remains the only character in the film that worth caring for. Loomis spends most of the time away from anything going on, like I said and even then; Laurie spends most of her time on her back in a hospital bed. Everyone else are not characters but mere puppets used in a freak show of violence, murder and nasty scolding so bad that I can't remember most of the character's names. There is a nasty irony behind the deaths: the guy in charge of the hospital probably has a say in which patient gets what amount from syringed drugs and he dies via syringe; the night watchmen-come-handyman gets it with the hammer and the sexually active nurse who states that 'she's hot' or something like that gets burnt up pretty bad.So after we've been presented with these murders of people Myers didn't have to kill with fantasies he could've fulfilled anywhere else, we get the final third involving Laurie and Myers. Myers is a guy who lumbers around as if he's the Michelin man gone without sleep for several days and yet off screen, he can cover the vast corridors of the hospital and catch up with Laurie in an instant. Myers can run but can't hide, Laurie is the opposite: she can hide but can't run and would rather hang around the car park than run away from the establishment come the end. Halloween II is a film that will not amaze you, it will not scare you and yet it will probably entertain you. Feeling more like a video nasty than a proper sequel to a proper film, more recent audiences may want to pop in a Saw instalment, a Hostel film or perhaps Carpenter's Assault on Prescient 13 as Halloween II is 1980s torture porn mixed in with that 'last stand' atmosphere and made to look like a video nasty.",Halloween II
60,leplatypus,The mask comes off (web),4,4 August 2014,"This sequel is just like « BF2 », « Rocky 2 » or even the « Milleniuem » saga as this sequel begins when the previous movie has left. Unlike the above mentioned, this one struggles to find its momentum, all the more than the heroin (Jamie) is wounded and lies in a hospital bed. The movie really begins as the chase begins as well : the idea of an empty hospital is indeed good as the place seems really haunting. However, the action seems a bit unbelievable as Jamie is sometimes as week as a born puppy or can run as fast a rabbit. But the movie is not doomed to go to trash : it seems to follow the novelization as it gives some elements of the puzzle of Myers' history. Next, it's funny to see that it's indeed those who commit sex that succumb ! At last, it's true that as soon as you know that the mask was the face of Captain Kirk, you can't keep recognizing Shatner then. And i wonder if subconsciously i hadn't already make the connection before learning it on the boards, explaining that i have always found the mask particularly frightening and suggestive !",Halloween II
61,damianphelps,Good Fun Slasher,8,7 March 2021,I love how this film continues from one minute to the next between part one and two. So the tension is there from the start.Does lose a little compared to the original but its hard to put my finger on what that is exactly.Works perfectly as a late night double header!,Halloween II
62,digitalbeachbum,Boring,1,30 October 2021,"I remember when this was released. Everyone in school was talking about it and how frightened they were to watch it. However, there is a difference between gore and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense. He could do more in one scene with out showing any violence or blood than any of these movies could ever poop out. This is not in any way a scary or suspenseful movie. It is gore. Period.There is no imagination left to the movie. The key to making a good scary movie is to let the viewer form their images in their own mind. Then they scare their selves. The best way to ruin a movie is to show too much. That's the problem with this movie. It shows everything. Who cares? Idiots. People who only want to see blood and guts. If you wanted to see blood and guts, then go join the military and go off to war.",Halloween II
63,insomniac_rod,"Decent, dark sequel.",8,28 December 2006,"""Halloween II"" starts immediately after the events of the original ""Halloween"", which ends in the most possible shocking manner (for it's time). After Michael Myers was shot 6 times, yes, 6 times by Dr. Loomis he manages to escape and spread terror in Haddonfield. The same night, he goes on a killing rampage in a hospital and streets and once again Dr. Loomis is on his hunt. But what is behind Myers' motives? Well, Rick Rosenthal and co. believed that it would be interesting to link Myers to Laurie Strode in the closest way possible; a family link. Soon after we find that Michael and Laurie are siblings, the plot takes a new twist where Laurie will try to survive Myers attacks with the aid of Dr. Loomis.""Halloween II"" is the straight slasher sequel to the 1978 ""masterpiece"". By straight slasher I mean that if has lots of gore, many killings, and more on screen time for Michael Myers. While the original has a more suspenseful and mysterious tone, this sequel goes straight to the point with all the killings and chasing sequences but with a dark tone and a creepy atmosphere. I really dug the opening sequence were Myers sneaks in some homes and finds a butcher's knife, the prowls until he murders an innocent girl. The POV shots are always great.Also, this sequel is dark and has some scary scenes and the occasional jump out of your seat tricks. But overall, ""Halloween II"" is more than just a slasher sequel. It's a solid Horror movie with a creepy setting, a decent plot, and good score. Also, it is a heavily underrated movie that should be considered among the best sequels to a good Horror movie ever made.Donald Pleasence is great as always in the role that gained for him thousands of fans. Jamie Lee Curtis also shines through the movie and does a very good job.Give a try to ""Halloween II"" if you are a fan of the slasher sub-genre; if you are not, you will be pleased to find out more than you expect. The movie is dark and has a decent plot, something unlikely to happen in most 80's slashers.My beef with the movie were the low production values. The cinematography is poor and the movie is screaming for a proper DVD release. Apart from that, this is a must see.The ending will let you satisfied... until ""The Return of Michael Myers"".-",Halloween II
64,matthewssilverhammer,"Less thoughtful, but maybe more fun.",7,28 October 2018,"I didn't realize this picked up immediately following the events of the first, though it certainly makes sense that's Michael's night of terror wouldn't have just suddenly ended after his mysterious disappearance (should've taken note, Halloween 2018). There's some great stuff here, especially the extension of Laurie's bad-ass-ery, & the revelation of who Michael is, all while keeping much of his anonymity intact (again...should've taken note, Halloween 2018).",Halloween II
65,Anonymous_Maxine,Why did they have to change the music? It was already perfect!,3,29 October 2004,"I guess I can understand, you have the first sequel to one of the most successful horror movies ever made, maybe using the same music would have come off as trying too hard to cash in on the success of the original. This is, on the other hand, a sequel, and an inherent quality of any sequel is cashing in on the success of the original. It's during the movie itself that it has to earn itself the right to exist, to show that it can stand on its own and not just in the shadow of its predecessor. So Halloween II tries right off the bat to try something new, it just wasn't done right. It's like they had the original simple but effective theme song played on a grand piano and then played the sequel's song on some cheap K-Mart electric piano with some goofy effects added on. Too bad.That being said, at least the rest of the movie was awful. Wait, I shouldn't say that. Not awful, just not good. It wastes not time at all, replaying the very last scene in the original film and then literally picking up the minute the previous film left off, as though the first sequel is not so much a sequel as much as simply a continuation, like Kill Bill. I'm guessing that it was a desired impression that the two movies want to look like one long movie that has been cut into two parts. Dr. Loomis shot Michael Meyers at the end of the previous movie (famously seven times and then runs around yelling about how he shot him six times), pushing him off the second floor balcony with his hail of bullets, then walked to the edge of the balcony and saw that Michael had disappears. The first sequel in the series details the relentless quest to stop Meyers before he can kill again. Needless to say, he wastes no time. Of the three most famous slashers in horror history, Michael Meyers, Jason Voorhees, and Freddy Krueger, Meyers is by far the most relentless. Granted, they're all relentless, but Meyers' tendency to move slowly but deliberately gives me the impression that he is the least stoppable. Krueger can only attack in dreams, and Jason at least takes time to go back to his cabin and regroup, you might say. Get his bearings and plan out his next attack, however much planning he is capable of, anyway. Michael just gets up, and as soon as he has his target in sight he's like the T-1000. He just keeps moving toward his target, falling over when he gets shot a bunch of times and killing the odd teenager unfortunate enough to get in front of him, but never, ever stopping. Once the movie gets going, it's not long before we wind up in a Darkened And Deserted Hospital and the movie devolves into a series of creative death scenes. As you well know, much of the success of horror movies relies on the creativeness and originality of the death scenes. Kill enough people in enough interesting and new ways, and you have a good movie, in general. Halloween II has some creative scenes, but very few that are believable, and the cardinal sin of the creative death scene, many that make you slap your forehead at how stupid people can be.I'll tell you who I have no sympathy for, for example. At one point a hospital orderly named Jimmy comes across a nurse who has an IV needle in her arm, which Michael probably put there since it's just there to allow all the blood to run from her body and onto the floor. So this guy walks into the room, and doesn't notice that she has been bled to death until he kneels beside her and runs his hand along the tube from the needle in her arm to the end dripping all her blood onto the floor, and then he doesn't notice that he has been standing in a huge puddle of blood since the second he walked in the door until he stands up and slips on it, falling over backward and cracking his head on the floor. Let me just tell you this, I'll leave it up to Major Payne to inform him where he can go to look for sympathy. Then he shows up later, dazed and confused, to get into the car in which Laurie is hiding, act all dazed and confused, and then suddenly die.Here's another problem I had with the movie. It makes perfect sense that it takes place in the hospital, since that was where Laurie was taken after her encounter with Michael at the end of the last movie, it's the hospital itself that really bothered me. It is truly a cheap, cheap trick in a horror movie to have something like a dark and deserted hospital, which is something that simply does not exist. No hospital is EVER darkened or deserted as it was in this movie. The lights are never dimmed like that for any reason, at least in the halls, and there are always nurses and orderlies and the occasional doctor wandering the halls and seeing to patients. Hospitals are understandably not the kind of establishments that close for business at the end of the day. I guess I just wish someone could come along and make a good horror movie in a hospital without having to resort to things like no one being around and everything being dark all the time. I have great confidence that it can be done.I think that one of the main reasons that Halloween doesn't work nearly as well as its predecessor, even though it presents itself as merely the second half of it, is because it was guaranteed to be a box office success. The original film was a tremendous smash financially, and the filmmakers knew that just about anything called Halloween II was going to generate a huge amount of interest, so the movie comes off as having been slapped together and cheapened just to get something into the theaters. Michael Meyers was a brooding force in the original film, always near the edge of the screen or just out of sight, never seen very clearly. Now he's front and center and well lit, even in the hospital. We can even see his very eyes, and after Laurie has shot both of them out, if you can believe that. It's like the movie was made just so we could get closer and more personal with Michael Meyers, but that only serves to diminish his image. On the other hand, it's good that they didn't try to keep Meyers in the shadows, or, even worse, try to make him even more of a distant and dark character. Had they done that they might have lost sight of him completely, and as we all know, that kind of thinking will leave you with Halloween III!",Halloween II
66,jzappa,Could've Been A Lot Better,7,24 September 2006,"Halloween II is a surprisingly substantial slasher sequel. It has clear ideas and has a much different but equally scary concept. Instead of a small town street, we're in a sleepy hospital overnight. Halloween II just suffers from a surpassing amount of inconsistencies.I used to like this one better than the original Halloween, because it just starts, immediately. Also, being trapped in a minimally populated small town hospital riveted me and truly scared me. Years later, I realize that it has too much going on outside the hospital to be as claustrophobic as I wish it would be. There's a pretty futile plot strand outside of the hospital that detracts from the movie. If Halloween II were confined to the hospital, quiet with suspense slowly rising, with the murders and Jamie Lee Curtis immobilized in her room and such, it would be a greatly surpassing sequel. And even then, taking into account that the hospital has several wings, an emergency room and a surgical ward, it should not have a mere four nurses, one doctor, and two ambulance drivers staffed for the entire hospital, even if it is the night shift on the very Halloween on which several homicides have taken place. However, it does not do that, and it has twice the ridiculous details that almost completely ruin scenes of potentially great fright and suspense.",Halloween II
67,videorama-759-859391,Oh what a norm night in Horrorville,6,28 April 2014,"Continuing on from the original, again it appears, you can't keep a good psycho down, no matter how many shots you put into him. You know you've got a serious problem, if this is the case. Avenging psychopath, Michael Myers, continues wracking carnage on society, performing multiple slayings, what have you on innocents, some of them not so innocent. With today's standards, the violence here seems pretty tame. Jamie Lee Curtis is a truly talented horror icon, if ever there were one. Unfortunately here, she spends most of her time in a hospitable bedroom, quite traumatized, after some near brushes with death, and guess who's coming for her. For fans of Halloween, this sequel really didn't impress me, but more so, would of done in the day. I just found it the norm here, though I've only seen snippets of the original, and have read actually about half of it script, where I've video'd this one instead, a few times. It's just the feel I got off of it. Highlight scene, is the therapeutic spa one with a hot affectionate nurse, and a dirty minded and heartless male orderly, (who later went onto star in River's Edge, among other films as the sit at home boyfriend of Keanu Reeves's Mum's) getting it on, where soon they become hip to the fact of a menois de trois, before they're offed. As always, Donald Pleasance is great as the long suffering head shrink, Loomis, before being replaced much later by Malcolm Mcdowell, giving a another great portrayal. This Halloween is more likely to send kids, switching off, and doing their own trick or treating.",Halloween II
68,gwnightscream,Good Sequel That Probably Should've Been The Last!,6,27 February 2012,"Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis star in this 1981 horror sequel. This sequel picks up where the original left off with Dr. Sam Loomis (Pleasence) pursuing his escaped patient, Michael Myers (Dick Warock). Laurie Strode (Curtis) has been taken to a hospital and she and Loomis soon discover why she's targeted by Michael. It turns out that she's Michael's other sister and after Michael kills most of the hospital staff, it becomes a hellish battle with Loomis, Laurie & Michael. I like how this picks up where the first film left off, Warlock is great as Michael, John Carpenter & Alan Howarth's score is excellent as usual.

69,GOWBTW,Michael Myers strikes again!,9,19 August 2009,"Haddonfield, Illinois is under attack again! And his target, Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis), his other sister! He attacked her in the first movie, and Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasence) makes sure that he doesn't get her either. Other people are in shock when other people get killed by this demonic man. It was amazing when he flattened the tires in some cars, and his killing methods are getting more advanced. The therapy room scene is one reason to stay away from hospitals. Turning up the water temperature is one thing, with Micheal Myers, it's deadly! I liked the part where Micheal stabbed the pillows, also where he lifted the poor nurse with the scalpel. The real good part is where Laurie shot out Myers' eyes when he tried to attack her and Dr. Loomis blows him away. A lot more to give than the first, plus the kill factor is just as intense. This movie is a keeper, and just as scary as the first! 4 out of 5 stars!",Halloween II
70,FiendishDramaturgy,"Just as scary, dramatic and entertaining as the original!",8,14 September 2003,"This marvelous sequel picks up right where the first one left off, and delivers an end product that is just as scary, dramatic and entertaining as the original!This sequel is just as good to ""Halloween"" as ""The Godfather, Part 2"" was to ""The Godfather."" Debra Hill and John Carpenter have produced another fine production in this sequel which strives hard to justice to the original...and succeeds with flying colors.On watching these movies again for this review, I have really come to appreciate just how well this movie follows the original. The acting is quite enjoyable, the scenes are well thought-out out and executed and the plot is firmly in place and congruent with the first movie.These movies, the Halloween ""series,"" were meant to be more than just your run of the mill slasher flix, and these first two were just that. After this one, they go off the storyline and venture off into the Land of Stupid...all the way to Halloween H20. That's where you get a free pass from Insipid-land for a beautiful sequel made 20 years after the original. Great movie! And then we slip back into the World of Idiotic Movies with Halloween-Resurrection. And I understand that they are in production with Halloween 9 *Why?!*In my opinion, just get H 1, 2 and H20 and run them back to back. You honestly never EVER miss the other movies which had nothing whatSOever to do with the original movie or its storyline. H2 and H20 bring it back into line and perpetuate the horror that is Michael Myers.Excellent sequel to an excellent movie. Wonderfully scary slasher with a good plot. This is also the movie where you discover why Laurie Strode is being pursued by psycho/stalker/slasher Michael A. Myers.You get a few good, but uncomfortable, laughs as well. Laughing at our fears is healthy for us. I'm not in ANY way saying this movie is campy because it's far from it. It is definitely one of the few truly GOOD horror movies out there. But like the scene where the watchman at the hospital investigates the phone outages, looks into the dumpster and gets the living begeezes scared out of him makes you jump and then laugh due to the source of his fright.If you like these movies, you may like the ""Scream"" trilogy, though I do hesitate to put them in the same category with ""Halloween.""It's also one of the Fiend's favorites and as such gets an 8/10 right alongside the original from...the Fiend :.",Halloween II
71,jtindahouse,I prefer it to the original,8,8 May 2018,"I'm not the biggest fan of the original 1978 'Halloween'. I respect it for what it is, but I do prefer a little more violence and gore in my horror. There's no reason you can't have both extreme suspense and then violence and gore to top it off. That is probably the reason I enjoyed the sequel a little more than the original (sinful, I know). For me though, it just had everything the original had, plus more. The great music is still around this time. It really is brilliant. It's so haunting and eerie and memorable. It just screams ""Danger!"". I also love how director Rick Rosenthal creates scenarios where there is a countdown of sorts (in creative ways like an elevator coming down floors) and the killer is getting closer and closer. This is when the film is at its most intense.There's the usual dodgy acting and some of the dialogue is written in a pretty cringe-worthy way. Other than that though this is a horror master-class that has aged extremely well. The character of Sam Loomis remains one of my favourite horror heroes to this day. If you're a fan of 'Michael Myers', but find the original a little slow for your liking, try this one out for size. It may be more to your liking. Hell, even if you love the original you should still be able to find enjoyment in this one.",Halloween II
72,Captain_Couth,Michael Myers is Back!!,7,13 June 2004,"Halloween 2 (1981) takes place the day after the events of the first film (despite the fact the film was produced three years later). The town is still in shock about what just happened. The only surviving babysitter (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a guest at the town's hospital. Whilst she's recovering from the shock and injury from her last run in with Michael, guess who decides to pay her a visit after hours?Halloween 2 wasn't directed this time around by John Carpenter. He designated some ""new"" blood for the second picture Rick Rosenthal. Mr.Rosenthal directed the sequel in a similar style that made the first one a hit. But being the 80's, style wasn't in anymore so after a spat over the final cut, Rosenthal was dismissed and the film was re-edited and several scenes of gore were spliced in. It's a shame because there was nothing wrong with the film to begin with. You can sometimes catch the director's cut on T.V. (AMC once in awhile plays it by default). But most of the T.V. prints are just the theatrical version heavily edited.By all means the original cut is far superior to the theatrical release. The next time Halloween 2 comes on regular T.V. or commercial cable, take a chance because you'll be in for a treat!Director's cut: B+Theatrical: D+",Halloween II
73,hellraiser7,The Night isn't over yet.,8,9 November 2013,"Sequels in horror to me are sometimes the most interesting because there seems to me more creative freedom, probably because of the main monster you can pretty much do more with it or take em any direction you want to go. I'm not normally a fan of horror film sequels, most are misses then hits in my book but this film is one of those hits.What I really like about this sequel is it's premise where it takes place just moments after the ending. I think thats a cool idea which is something I never see much, most sequels take place usually years latter. This approach made the first one connect more adequately with this sequel which made the two film seem like one movie.I love the score as usual, it's been remixed with the use of the synthesizer and I feel this film has the best use of it. I still like the original piano score, but the synthesizer version is great in it's own way it's still has a spooky tone to it but has an almost upbeat sensibility to it. Even like them using the old song ""Mr. Sandman"" which was never the same to me after watching this film.The main characters are good as usual. Jamie Lee Curtis is good as Laurie as usual despite not in the film that long. Laurie is really sympathetic because she's scared out of her wits afraid Michael is still after her, which he is. Her injuries really put a handicap factor on her which means she won't be able to move very fast. Yet, as usual she can still hold her own against danger, really loved how she handled the revolver makes me wonder if she is an expert marksman, if you've seen the places she shot. But I like that there was a revelation on her character which I felt provided depth to her and made her not just another typical wrong place wrong time protagonist.Donald Plesence is good as usual as Dr. Sam Lommis. His character was almost a show stealer, in a way this film made him more the main protagonist. I like how he's more active in this film, he has some memorable liners my favorite ""heightens my sense of security"". Even sympathetic as the Sheriff who drank a can of dumb ass keeps blaming him for Michael's escape which really wasn't his fault, and his efforts get undermined for no good reason.Michael (The Shape) is still well him. I like that here we see some creative kills from him, the effects on those kills are really up to par but not to exploitive. My favorite kill is the hammer to the head, it was to me the most painful because of the little sound affect at the end after Michael swinged it overhead, ouch.However what powers the film the most is in it's suspense and atmosphere. I really like the fact that the hospital has been used as the arena. Hospitals in horror I always thought were creepy, heck whenever I play the""Silent Hill"" video games I'm always a little wary of going in because they practically have death written all over them. Which is the perfect place for Michael, in the first one it was more open world where Mike had plenty of places to go, but here this is in a confined space despite limited to open area he has more places to hide then before, let alone all the resources he needs and Laurie where he wants her; these things really give Mike an advantage. Let alone location of the hospital which is far from town which means help is far away.I like the use of lighting, it's true that a normal hospital would never have that much low lighting at night. But this choice I felt was wise because it made the hospital seem instead of a place of danger instead of salvation. Each shadow and every dark corridor feels like The Shape could be hiding. Even like the use of the monitor camera shots, where we would see Michael walk in one hallway on the monitors which is basically a one step ahead device.And that chase scene my favorite scene in the film, between Laurie and Mike is thrilling and has the participatory factor as usual where I was thinking ""cmon find a way out now now now!""; personally I like this chase scene between the two in this film the best because Laurie and Mike had more places to go and utilize the enviorment of the hospital well.The only problems is I do think the pacing of the film does lag a bit around the second half. I didn't really care much for any of the new supporting characters they were all two dimensional and disposable in my book, well OK a few of them have a moment or two like Budd who sings that song I thought was funny, but like I said moments it's not enough.Overall it's a solid follow up, it doesn't blow me away like the first but it's not trying to. But all the same like any Halloween treat it's worth a try. The night of Michael Myers is far from over.Rating: 3 stars",Halloween II
74,Bezenby,He's back for more...during visiting hours,7,27 February 2014,"Michael Myers turns into full on indestructible killing machine mode for this groovy sequel to John Carpenter's film – It's not as creepy, but as a slasher film it sure delivers the goods. You might have to switch your brain off however as this is one of those film where people continually do daft things, but other than that a good time can be had by all.This one takes place several seconds after the last film, with entirely ineffectual Doctor Loomis as usual looking in the wrong places for Michael, who's out wandering the almost police free streets, stopping off long enough to kill a girl randomly while the police accidentally run over a guy who kind of looks like Myers, spending most of the film trying to find dental records. Meanwhile, Michael's headed over to the local hospital to check in on the stunned victim Laurie, and he ain't bringing some grapes and a bottle of Lucozade!As usual, we get to meet out cast of victims, most of which work in the hospital. I won't bother really telling you who is who because basically they're here to be wasted in various ways, in a more graphic manner (but still not as over the top as some slashers from this period). I think this sequel manages to do a good job of following up from the last film. Everything's cranked up a bit more (including a body count in double figures), Michael's even more indestructible than the last time, Donald Pleasance is more loony than the last time and the cinematography and soundtrack are just as good. I remember enjoying this one years ago as a teenager and still enjoy it now. Just don't go nitpicking and you'll be fine.",Halloween II
75,Polaris_DiB,...and so on,6,1 May 2007,"Halloween II starts right where Halloween I left off, which is a good thing because Halloween I didn't really end so much as realize that it no longer had the budget to go where the story wanted. Halloween II gives it the budget, and the two of them could possibly make a decent single feature cut except that both of them attempt to use a form of rising tension that could possibly be undermined by putting the two back-to-back.Halloween I has its share of absurdities, but most of them are silly and accepted anyway... Halloween II is a little worse, but still manages to be relatively decent. Sure, Michael being unable to force open an elevator when he can break through thick wooden doors seems a little ridiculous, but the shot of Michael walking right through the glass door near the end just can't be understated for cool factor. It's an enjoyable flick, even if sometimes it gets a little dumb.I think the revealing twist about Jamie Lee Curtis' character's true relationship to Michael was probably a good idea at the time, but it's very random ultimately. Remember that Michael stalked Jamie Lee Curtis and the little boy in the first film, basically because they were the first people he saw. I guess he might have ""realized"" then, but it seems a far stretch. I don't think, overall, that relationship really works out as well as Carpenter thought it would.This movie is also more removed away from the voyeuristic and sexualized aspect of the first film, almost adding in sex by proxy and taking more glee in the actual killing spree. Three times the amount of victims populate this spectacle than the previous movie, and oftentimes the victims are much more innocent. So already the series is changing away from it's own beginning mythology and gearing up for straightforward horror motifs. Oh well.--PolarisDiB",Halloween II
76,dee.reid,"A waste of time, really, but not effort...",6,27 October 2012,"The only real reason to watch 1981's ""Halloween II,"" the big studio-backed successor to John Carpenter's landmark horror film ""Halloween"" (1978), is the fact that Carpenter himself was involved in the film's production. As such, ""Halloween II"" becomes a waste of time, but not a waste of the effort that went into producing it.Carpenter co-wrote the film with partner Debra Hill (as they had done on ""Halloween""), but directorial duties were instead handed over to Rick Rosenthal. Rosenthal is no John Carpenter (obviously), but he does at least make the movie interesting and at times, a little scary. The main problem with ""Halloween II"" is that it is pretty much a rehash of the previous film, and is more in touch with the numerous imitators its predecessor had spawned over the three years since that dark, fateful night in 1978.""Halloween II"" is a direct follow-up to ""Halloween,"" which depicted an escaped maniac stalking and killing the teenage babysitters of a small (fictional) Illinois town called Haddonfield on Halloween night. The sequel picks up with a brief recap of ""Halloween's"" final moments where Dr. Sam Loomis (the late Donald Pleasance) pumped six bullets into the chest of knife-wielding mass murderer Michael Myers. In the process, Loomis also saved the life of would-be victim Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).Laurie is rushed to the hospital to recover from a few minor injuries and the trauma of the night's events. Loomis, meanwhile, continues his obsessive hunt for Michael Myers before he has a chance to kill again. As fate would have it, Myers shows up at the hospital and begins killing the doctors and nurses on staff that night. And later on in the picture, we get a shocking revelation in that we learn just why Michael Myers is so intent on specifically targeting poor Laurie Strode.For a horror sequel, ""Halloween II"" is surprisingly well-made, and does have some pretty suspenseful moments - though none of this is on par with the utter perfection of ""Halloween."" As I stated earlier, because ""Halloween II"" is so much in league with the slasher movie spawn of its predecessor, it feels more like those cheap imitations, and not a worthwhile sequel to a landmark horror picture. The characters are paper-thin, the violence is much more graphic and palpable (the first movie contained only a minimum of violence and gore), and the whole thing just stinks of rehash - although it does, in fact, continue the story of the first film, rather than just repeating the exact same scenario over again.One of the big bonuses of ""Halloween II"" is its synthesizer-based score, which was composed by Carpenter himself and frequent collaborator Alan Howarth (they had just worked on Carpenter's ""Escape from New York"" and were preparing for ""The Thing""). The score for ""Halloween II"" contains many of the same motifs (including the signature 5/4 time rhythm) but this score relies much heavier on electronics, rather than acoustics, as it was on the first picture. But like the first movie, the score fits neatly into any scene it's placed and succeeds in managing to create some pretty suspenseful scenes.Overall, ""Halloween II"" was never going to repeat the massive success of ""Halloween,"" which is unquestionably one of the best and greatest horror movies of all time. But unlike most horror movie sequels since then, ""Halloween II"" is a waste of time, but not the effort that was put into making it.After all, it is just More of the Night HE Came Home...6/10",Halloween II
77,atinder,Good sequel,8,1 February 2010,"It is still Halloween, 1978, and Michael Myers is on the loose after escaping certain death at Dr. Loomis' hands. By now, the entire sheriff's department is hunting for him, and Laurie Strode - his intended victim - has been taken to Haddonfield Hospital to be treated for wounds inflicted by Michael. Only Loomis & Sheriff Brackett- whose daughter had been murdered by Myers - seem aware of Myers' presence in the town, and a young man unknowingly alerts Myers to Laurie's location. When Myers reaches the hospital he eliminates virtually the entire staff in his pursuit. Meanwhile, Marion Chambers - who had been assisting Loomis during the planned pickup of Myers for his trial - meets up with Loomis to advise him that Myers is after Laurie for 1 reason: she is his sister - born 2 years before he was committed. Loomis is forced to overpower the U.S. Marshal who was to return him to Smith's Grove, and head for Haddonfield Hospital to stop Myers' blood spree. But are they too late?.This is great sequel to the first Halloween movie, it bit long then the first movie and the deaths are a lot more nasty then then the first movie but not gory which i really liked and again this has great atmosphere from start to end from the movie and i didn't not find boring at all.Great acting from the whole cast and i did find Michael Myers really creepy in this movie thanks the chilling Halloween theme tuneGreat sequel 8 out 10",Halloween II
78,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Slick continuation of the original night,9,21 November 2015,"Halloween II is essentially more of the same, with less suspense and a lot more murder. I'm fine with this, seeing as how Michael made his spooky, paces entrance, ramped up for a few warmup kills, and by this time he's ready for an all out bloodbath. 'More is better ' seems to be the mantra with horror sequels, and although this is not always a smart idea, I think it's nice to see him up his game from the first outing. This one takes place on the same halloween night, right after the first one left off. Seemingly invincible Mikey has taken on his heels, slipping through the suburban neighbourhoods and causing all kinds of misery, before eventually hunting Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to the hospital she has been taken too, with Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) in full pursuit. This one purposefully tries to retain both the music and atmosphere of the first, and while it falters a bit and feels forced at times (I'm not a fan of the whole silly hot tub sequence) there's some really fine moments later on when Michael chases her through abandoned hospital hallways that are as God as anything in the first round. Carpenter steps back a bit, favouring producing duties as opposed to directing, and this shows at the seams a bit, but not enough to hurt the film. A solid sequel, perfect as a nice double bill with H1, probably the second best out of the original franchise.",Halloween II
79,drownnnsoda,Excellent Sequel To A Classic.,8,1 January 2005,"""Halloween II"" starts off exactly where part one ended, right after Michael completed his murders in the first ""Halloween"" film. With Laurie in the hospital, police begin searching for the killer all over Haddonfield. But the elusive Michael is still lurking around the streets, and is heading straight to the city hospital, where Laurie is now at. While Laurie sleeps in her hospital bed, Michael breaks in and begins to kill off hospital staff members one by one, searching for his sister. And when he finally finds her, the night of terror continues as she tries to save herself, being chased by Michael through the hospital hallways.Personally I liked the first ""Halloween"" better as I'm sure most people did, but if you like this one better I could see why - it's a great sequel. Rick Rosenthal (who many years later directed the disappointing ""Halloween: Resurrection"") does a good job in this film, and the acting is great. Jamie Lee Curtis is wonderful in this, just as she always is. The same goes for Donald Pleasance. The Halloween theme is used again appropriately. Michael is menacing and creepy. It has some genuinely scary moments, and interesting death scenes. There were some creative death scenes (hot tub particularly, quite nasty). But the long chase between Michael and Laurie is just great. It was all very well done and I liked the way the film ended too.Bottom line is, if you enjoyed the original ""Halloween"", you should enjoy this one. Get a few friends, and kick back and watch ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II"" back to back, you should enjoy it. But whatever you do, stay away from the crapfest ""Halloween III"", which is unrelated to the other films. Definitely one of the best horror sequels of all time 8/10.",Halloween II
80,lukem-52760,Brilliant Sequel. I Remember Always Watching My Double Bill Video Tape of Both Films .,10,11 August 2018,"H2 is an excellent atmospheric horror flick that's just like Carpenters style & with an amazing musical score just like the first Classic!!!I actually think this is the scariest Michael Myers of the franchise & this movie has a much more raw feel to it.I always remember watching my double bill video of both Halloween films, so i have such strong Nostalgia for both of these Classic Horror films. Infact i would say it was both Halloween's & the Cult Classic Halloween 3: Season of the Witch & Carpenter's The Fog that made me into a Horror movie fan.H2 is underrated & it shouldn't be at all infact it's just as good & exciting & well made as the original!!! The whole look is creepy & dark & menacing with a real sense of dread & with that stunning cinematography again by the legendary Dean Cundy who shot most of carpenters classic films.Donald pleasence is excellent once again as Panicked Dr. Loomis, a Classic role that cemented Pleasence as one of the greats of Horror Cinema. I adore the first 3 Halloween films.The look & mood & music is PERFECT & this time it has a much more raw & viscous feel like the brutal slashers of that time!!! I love this film & grew up watching this & the first film on a double feature video,H2 is beautifully made & loving crafted & this is the absolute scariest that Michael Myers has ever been in!!! His mask is scary & he is much more savage & raw & there's a real grittier tone to this movie & with that raw sounding electronic synth tune,it's pure Horror & actually scary.The new surroundings is also an excellent & exciting place for all this evil to happen in that big dark & creepy hospital setting it's perfect, A perfect sequel that's almost as good as the classic original or at least in my eyes as i like H2 probably more as the Hospital setting is so cool & so exciting & the score by Carpenter is upped to be more menacing & more creepy this time & is a better score.Halloween (1978) & Halloween 2 (1981) are True Horror/Thriller classic's.I grew up loving this fantastic franchise.",Halloween II
81,davispittman,Slightly better than Halloween (1978),6,31 March 2017,"I think this is one of those cases where the sequel is actually better than the original movie. Kind of like with the Scream movies. I don't know why I didn't care for the first Halloween Michael Myers movie because just about the rest of the world loved it. But it just didn't move me for whatever reason. And I didn't love this movie either, but I liked it a little better than the first film. The plot is pretty predictable and you know just about everything that's going to happen, and yes some of those scenes are kind of tiring, but others are alright. I did really like Jamie lee Curtis, she did well with role, as always. I think the reason I liked this movie is because it did a better job at keeping your attention. To be quite honest neither of the movies are all that scary, but at least this one is at least kind of thrilling/exciting in some parts. If a horror movie isn't gonna turn out to be scary, then it leaves you with a conundrum. Was it a good horror movie if it was fun/exciting but not scary? I think in some cases this can be true and others not. In this case, I think a 6 is a pretty fair rating. It's not a good movie per say, but it's not bad and it's certainly more enjoyable than the first Halloween film. It's your call, to be honest there are much better scary movies to enjoy.",Halloween II

85,Witchfinder-General-666,Halloween Night Ain't Over Yet...,7,18 June 2008,"The first sequel to one of the most popular Horror films ever, ""Halloween II"" of 1981 is a more than decent follow-up to its great predecessor with rare approach - The film picks up right where ""Halloween"" ended. It is still Halloween night, 1978, and the hell that broke loose in the little town of Heddonfield, Illinois in part 1 is not about to stop... ***SPOILERS*** After the traumatic events earlier the same night, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is brought to a hospital. Masked killer Michael Myers, however, has not died from his injuries, but is still on the loose and well enough to concentrate on his hobby of slaughtering teenagers. While Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is, along with the town sheriff, desperately looking for Myers on the streets of Heddonfield, our masked Psycho knows exactly where to head... ""Halloween II"" confirms what was actually quite clear in the first film - that main protagonist Laurie Strode, who got adopted at an early age, is actually Myers' sister. The film may not quite have the originality of its predecessor, and it certainly isn't a milestone like ""Halloween"" was, but, as far as Slasher-sequels go, this is actually top-notch! While there are not too many new ideas, ""Halloween II"" successfully keeps up with the quality of the original, and even brings in quite a bit more action. While original ""Halloween"" had a story to build up (even if not a very complex one), the sequel has the ability to focus only on killings and suspense throughout. Jamie Lee Curtis is still a doll, and she still plays the leading character of Laurie Strode greatly. The great Donald Pleasence (one of my favorite actors) is once again brilliant in the role of Dr. Sam Loomis (I haven't seen Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" remake so far, and while I'm also a fan of Malcolm McDowell I can hardly imagine anybody but Pleasence to play the role). The brilliant score by the original Halloween-director John Carpenter is still used, but some other music is added. The mood is again creepy, even though the sequel doesn't invest quite as much in atmosphere as the original did. All things considered, this is a surprisingly great sequel. ""Halloween II"" is by no means the milestone and classic that ""Halloween"" was, but it is still pretty damn creepy and extremely suspenseful. In terms of pure entertainment, this is almost as good as its predecessor. Highly recommended!",Halloween II

If you liked the first one you will definitely enjoy this. Skip ""Halloween 3"" though, because it is to over the top- a company run by homicidal leprechauns!. Then again you may want to watch THAT one for a good laugh only. 8/10.",Halloween II
87,Jonny_Numb,"Fewer pretensions, more slasher goodness",6,21 December 2006,"John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is one of the most overrated films in the annals of horror--a plodding, poorly-edited exercise in bloodless slashery with an aimless storyline and maddeningly banal dialog. 3 years after the success of its predecessor, ""Halloween II"" skulked onto the slasher horizon, with a decidedly different modus operandi. By 1981, Hollywood producers had manufactured a fair number of derivative 'slasher' films coasting on the success of Carpenter's film, many of which were a lot more entertaining (""Friday the 13th"" and its sequels are substandard films, but actually more fun to watch). ""Halloween II,"" coming on the crest of this wave, picked up where the original left off (with Laurie Strode whisked to the local hospital and Dr. Loomis on the hunt for Michael Myers), but heightened the gore and T&A to the point where it plays more like a rip-off than a sequel (in this case, that's a compliment). Rick Rosenthal (1983's ""Bad Boys"") takes over directorial duties, and does a fair job--he can stage a scene, but only at the expense of narrative continuity (there are few establishing shots in the hospital where a bulk of the film takes place, so it's anyone's guess as to where the action is happening). What the film improves is in putting Michael Myers front and center, instead of relegating him to the shadows--this unsubtle approach works surprisingly well, and Dick Warlock gives 'The Shape' a definite sense of chillingly menacing presence. The performances are what you'd expect--Jamie Lee Curtis' heavily-sedated Laurie makes an effective damsel in peril (a brilliant climactic 'chase' between her and Warlock is an incredibly suspenseful sequence), and Donald Pleasance gives it his all as the hyperventilating Loomis (though his initial hysterical reactions seem very out of character); the supporting cast is introduced for the sole sake of slaughter. For fans of the original, this sequel's marked difference in tone might be a turn-off, but for those looking for an unashamed, unpretentious slasher flick that's as dirtily satisfying as it is scary, give ""Halloween II"" a whirl.",Halloween II
88,aidanratesmovies,Incredibly Overrated,3,21 July 2021,"Dull, dense, and poorly directed- Halloween II is a hollow shell of the original film- with absolutely none of the tension and even dumber antics. The film can honestly be comically bad at times. Certain scenes or kills can feel like pratfalls, done by actors who have never been on screen a second in their life. The timing is so bad that you can't help but find it comedic at times, as director Rick Rosenthal clearly has no idea of how to develop tension on the screen. The screenplay is a mess and complete;ly dragged out, written by a tired John Carpenter who was reluctantly forced to write the sequel after the original became an unexpected hit. Some scenes are incredibly pointless, and each supporting character feels so incredibly thin that it's hard to think of them as anything but archetypes. The acting is quite bad, but Rosenthal's timing somehow makes it even worse at times. Jamie Lee Curtis tries her best, but many of her characters moments can feel quite silly and impractical at times and you'll probably find yourself yelling at your TV screen. I enjoy the look of this film a lot, I really like the style and how the cinematography is done. The costumes are done quite well, and visually it can almost seem to work. In the end though, Halloween II is a complete dud which may not be the worst sequel in the franchise, but is certainly a dreadful follow-up.My Rating: 3.3/10.",Halloween II
89,I_Ailurophile,Two word review: Oh no,2,14 December 2020,"'Halloween II,' also known as ""When a great filmmaker decides he's not invested.""There are sparse moments where the film tries to recreate the atmosphere and suspense of its predecessor--the simple looming terror of Michael stalking the town, or in this case, the hospital.Those moments--the strength of John Carpenter's 'Halloween' and of his style of film-making generally--are quickly subsumed and altogether overwhelmed by the pure mediocrity of a generic slasher.If this wasn't written and produced by Carpenter/Hill--if it didn't star Curtis & Pleasence, if it were about anyone other than Michael Myers--no one would care. If this were anything other than a 'Halloween' movie, it would be considered a bland slasher relegated to the memory hole of cinema history.Most of the violence and death in the movie is totally arbitrary, and unnecessary, as are many scenes generally. As the late great Roger Ebert had commented--the plot of the film, weak and meager as it is, only works because none of the characters have any common sense.The two greatest contributions of the film to the franchise--the revelation that Laurie is Michael's sister, and ""something something druids, something something Samhain""--are incredulously shoe-horned in, as ham-fisted as any plot points could be. It says much that Carpenter himself has essentially disavowed the film, having accordingly stated in an interview that his writing here ""mainly dealt with a lot of beer, sitting in front of a typewriter saying 'What ... am I doing? I don't know.'""The most sympathetic and relatable characters in the movie are the cat who leaps out of a dumpster, and Generic White Guy #3 who slips and suffers a head injury, then subsequently alerts Michael with a car horn as he slumps over the wheel. They wanted out of the movie as much as I did!By the time the unconvincing finale rolls around, I was all but ecstatic, just because it meant the film was almost over.I guess if you can't get enough of slashers, then sure, have at it. But what parts of the film aren't total rubbish are just too pedestrian and uninteresting to be worthwhile.Not really knowing anything else about 'Halloween II' ahead of time apart from Carpenter's lesser involvement, I had some hopes that it would be a worthy successor to the 1978 film.But, like I said:Oh no.",Halloween II
90,truemythmedia,Good Not Great,6,31 October 2019,"Sometimes when you want to watch a horror film you want something truly horrifying, and other times you just want something silly to throw on in the background to laugh at. This film is certainly not as good as the original ""Halloween"", but it is a fun slasher flick with some fun kills and, towards the end, some genuinely creepy (yet over the top) moments. If you go into this movie with middling expectations, you'll probably enjoy yourself; if you want something substantial, try something else.",Halloween II
91,masonsaul,A bad and unnecessary sequel,4,22 December 2018,"While the plot could have been interesting, Halloween II is a bad and unnecessary sequel. It sidelines Jamie Lee Curtis for most of the movie and fails to be scary, repeating most of the same scares as the original, making it predictable. The new score is awful, ruining the iconic theme as well as killing any suspense that is built.By the end of the movie the hoops it jumps through to keep Michael Myers alive is laughable as he is shot a ridiculous amount of times, and still gets back up. The twist that is interesting and adds depth to the main characters is poorly handled and feels tacked on.The redeeming qualities are the reliably great performances by Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis, when she is actually in it, and how laughably bad it is in places. It's also technically well filmed.",Halloween II
92,Samiam3,"A superior sequel, wow",7,8 August 2009,"As revolutionary as Halloween may have been (spawing the slasher category) the film itself was kind of dull and very little actually happens. Three years later, John Carpenter may have left the director's chair, but everything he and Debra Hill created has been matched and even surpassed by the first sequel.The film literally picks up from where the end credits of Halloween began. Looking at it from today's perspective, both movies could have been combined to make a three hour feature.After Laurie Strode's near fatal encounter with Michael Myers, she is taken to the hospital, and Myers follows her there while keeping to the shadows. Meanwhile, the town of Haddonfield has just discovered the three murders which have taken place on the street, and Dr. Sam Loomis is still out looking for his old patient, from fifteen years ago.If there is a problem with Halloween II, it is the character of Laurie. Carpenter's script doesn't give her anything to do, until the last twenty minutes. In fact I don't think she has any more than ten lines of dialog. She should probably go in the Guiness book of records for that, cinema's most silent protagonist, although she might rival that title with WALL-E.Whatever complains people have about Halloween II are probably an over statement. The most common ones are lack of subtlety and to much blood. Personally, I think the film is fine.",Halloween II
93,Movie-ManDan,"Not As Good As The First, But So What?",8,11 November 2014,"Everybody should have expected this movie to be inferior to the first. Sequels are almost never as good as the first. What makes this worse are the flaws and change of style. What makes this good is that is picks up seconds after the first one ended for a believable conclusion for Michael's killing spree. So it is only natural that there would be a change of pace with a bigger body count.Dr. Loomis shoots Michael Myers six times causing him to fall out of a window, then his body disappears. Laurie Strode is injured and traumatized after barely escaping Michael's clutches. With Loomis and the police seeking Michael's whereabouts, Michael himself has already made his way to the hospital where Laurie is at so he can finally kill her. As it turns out, Laurie is Michael's little sister, born two years before killing his older sister and adopted after the death of their parents. Finding out this information is nice to know and relevant, as it explains a little bit of why Michael wants Laurie, but never gives a full explanation. So there is still no motive provided, but he really wants to kill his little sister for some apparent reason. That is sadistic and scary. As Michael makes his way into the hospital to kill Laurie he kills random bystanders along the way, much like the first. For a hospital, it is pretty vacant. I'd say that is the biggest flaw. Other than that, a hospital location is a great place for killing, since a hospital is a place of certain death. Is a place of certain death like a hospital with a killer making mincemeat scarier than a quiet suburban town suddenly becoming a horror haven by one man? I don't know. I like both ideas. This movie just doesn't quite capture the essence and ""pazaz"" that the original had. But is is still a great flick nonetheless.3/4",Halloween II
94,ctomvelu1,Burning down the house,6,1 November 2009,"I was not crazy about this sequel to ""Halloween"" when it was initially released, primarily because Michael Myers goes on a bloody killing spree that to some degree substitutes for the tension (and minimal gore) of the first movie. Having just re-watched it, I am a bit more impressed. While there are way too many killings and the blood flows nonstop, it is fairly suspenseful and Michael is moderately sinister, although not nearly as scary as he was in the original. The movie picks up where the first movie ended, with an injured Laurie Strode (Curtis) being taken to a nearby hospital while Michael tracks her down. Along the way, he kills half of Haddonfield. The rest of this seemingly endless series is truly awful, unfortunately, Michael stopped being scary altogether, and the killings proved unimaginative. Jason, while no great shakes himself, became the slasher killer to watch through a series of endless sequels. The wonderful, hammy Donald Pleasence is back as Dr. Sam Loomis.",Halloween II
95,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A very tight sequel,8,13 January 2014,"Like many low budget films that achieved a strong following, a lot of popularity and financial success, a sequel was made to bring the viewers back another time for part two of whatever franchise had struck such a memorable chord. Halloween II (1981) is no different. After receiving such strong acclaim it was decided to whip out a continuation of the William Shatner mask wearing serial killer. And to be honest, it's one of the most tightly knit horror sequels viewers may see in a while. Compared to many other sequels, it doesn't start a year, month or even day later. It starts right at the ending of the Halloween (1978) movie and picks up right where it left off. It literally bookends the first movie and starts chugging along again with Michael's violent killing spree. There's not much of a change at all in this story. After the traumatizing experience of the night Michael Myers came to his hometown, Laurie Strode (Jaime Lee Curtis) is rushed to the local hospital where she is prepped to be taken care of. Little does she realize that Michael is still on the loose looking for her even after Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) loaded six slugs into him.This basically sets up the whole plot for the rest of the movie. Michael Myers makes his way to find Laurie, killing people in his path while Dr. Loomis and the police trail behind him, trying to find where he plans to be next. Interestingly enough, that's all this sequel needed. Fans enjoyed Myers so much in the first movie that they couldn't resist to pass up another feature involving him. John Carpenter (who decided no to direct this time) and Debra Hill's writing pretty much stays the same in this installment. But here's where audiences may get frustrated - the character of Laurie Strode still is of main focus but her character doesn't do much this time. For the most part she lies around in the hospital until the third act hits.But the writing also includes a little more explanation to why Michael Myers is so determined to kill Laurie, which does make it nice to get a little more background. However, it's still not enough to cover why he can withstand so many bullet wounds. That's utterly insane to imagine. The gore is also a little stronger here and that's understandable since the franchise was competing with several other horror films as well. Lastly, it's appreciated that John Carpenter's score sticks to the same theme and motifs that was created from in first but this time, more synths were used. Unfortunately this also removes the eerie atmosphere that was established from the first movie with piano keys. It's a different sound but not as effective. It's still a very strong sequel.For most horror sequels, the story is not this closely knit but it is done very competently here. With minor changes, the story of Michael Myers continues once more like it did in the first movie.",Halloween II
96,justin-fencsak,"After seeing the new Halloween, this one still stands on its own",8,11 September 2019,"When Halloween came back last year to record breaking results, it was a breath of fresh air and forced the filmakers to create two back to back sequels slated for release next year and the year after that. This pattern was similar to what Halloween II did when it came out, so a third one with no mention of Michael Myers and laurie strode came out to a muted response although the 1978 halloween movie was shown on a tv during a scene. If Halloween II was low budget, this sequel was big budget. The music is a bit different the pacing a bit longer, yet it still feels like a Halloween movie.",Halloween II
97,PredragReviews,"""Okay, let's get her clothes off.""",7,12 July 2016,"""Halloween 2"" is a solid sequel to the 1978 horror classic Halloween directed by horror legend John Carpenter. ""Halloween 2"" uses the slow building tension and suspense from the first film, and adds in the gore, blood, and unique more explicit kills that the first movie lacked. It also reveals the back story of Michael being Laurie's brother which was a good, well explained twist for the movie. Also, the large seemingly empty hospital filled with unsuspecting nurses and poor traumatized Laurie teamed with the original bone chilling music from the first adds to the movie's suspense and chill factor. Also, hearing the cheery classic song ""Mr. Sandman"" in H2's beginning and end credits makes a stark contrast to the blood-curdling macbre inflicted by the wrath of Myers! Great performances by Donald Pleasance and by the ""Scream Queen"" Jaime Lee Curtis in their original roles of Dr. Sam Loomis and Laurie Strode. Jamie Lee Curtis delivers another excellent performance proving that she can do more than just scream and run in the numerous first rate and nail biting chase scenes this movie provides but that she can also act, a lot better than most other actresses of the 80's slasher genre.Carpenter chose unknown Rick Rosenthal to direct and it's hard to tell just how much of the film's effectiveness is his, as it is said that producer Carpenter was unhappy with the film and did some re-editing and reshooting himself upping the gore and nudity quotas which, in turn, made Rosenthal unhappy with the film. Photographed by Dean Cundey, the look of the film certainly matches the first and with Carpenter again handling the music, the atmosphere is there. The two flicks fit together quite nicely but, it's hard to tell just how well Rosenthal did as director when Carpenter basically took over post production and added new material and rearranged sequences. The result is a solid slasher with some decent kills and gore and some nice suspense sequences as Myers stalks Laurie and the hospital staff in the dark hallways of the nearly abandoned hospital night shift. It has it's intense moments and it certainly is a bit more brutal then the first with a much larger body count. Though, obviously it doesn't have the first film's finesse.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Halloween II
98,Sandcooler,"Monotonous, but not completely without merits",5,14 January 2010,"Less visual style, more stuff happening: it wasn't really a bad approach to use while making a ""Halloween""-sequel. Sadly, the script just doesn't deliver. The kills are high in number, but the movie bores nonetheless because the deaths are nothing to look forward too. The closest they get to a creative scene is when the obligatory naked woman gets scalded in a hot tub. When I start considering that creative, chances are I'm watching a pretty uninspired movie. It's a good thing that Jamie Lee Curtis returned, but the best they could do with her was put her in a robe and have her run and scream all the time. Talk about waste of talent. One thing I did like however was how the setting was changed to a hospital, which I think was a pretty smart move. Michael Myers wading through those long, white corridors, it just looks right. Perhaps he gets too much exposure this time around, but that didn't really bother me much. Another thing I liked was the climax, which really should have ended it once and for all. How dead does a villain need to be to not resurrect? Anyway, this isn't the worst sequel, but probably not the best either.",Halloween II
99,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Horror in hospital,4,5 November 2013,"Picking up immediately after the first film ended, and slightly changing that film's ending (Myers is shot six times and falls off the back balcony in the original, here he is shot seven times and falls off the front balcony) , JLC is taken to a local hospital, where she is treated for her injuries sustained in the original, and followed by the masked Shape. The local authorities are busy searching every back alley and quiet street in town, which leaves Michael Myers plenty of time to hack his way through the hospital staff, instead of heading straight for his main target, JLC.At times, this sequel has some of the same mood and atmosphere as the original, but the drawn out, torturous deaths are a bit too violent to watch, even for a horror fan like myself. A syringe in the eyeball, throats slashed, people boiled in scalding water etc. is all on tap here, in scenes directed by uncredited John Carpenter in post production.Television airings of this sequel rearrange the sequence of events, and show several scenes out of order, which only confuses the viewers more.Climactic explosion is good, as is the opening title sequence, but again, the film alternates between violently gory, and boring. JLC has what is basically an extended cameo, perhaps 20 minutes of the film's run time.",Halloween II
100,slayrrr666,"The best of the sequels, and a great movie as well",10,30 August 2004,"`Halloween II' is a more than adequate sequel to one of the greatest horror films of all time.**SPOILERS**After Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) has been removed from the Myer's house and hauled away to a hospital, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) scour the neighborhood for Michael after he disappeared. Michael recovers, finds a new knife and discovers where Laurie is staying. He storms off after her as Loomis finds a young teen that resembles Michael and accidentally allows his death. At the hospital, the staff is anxiously awaiting Laurie's arrival as it has been a slow night. They don't anticipate all the other bodies that arrive with hers, and find any excuse to not work on her. As Michael stalks through the hospital dispatching everyone who works there systematically, no one wonders why everyone is missing. Loomis is ordered out of the city and back to the psychiatric hospital, and while being escorted away by the Marshal (John Zenda), he makes a startling realization about Laurie and her relationship with Michael. He returns to the hospital with the Marshal and his assistant (Nancy Stephens) to find the hospital deserted off personal and only Laurie left alive. After a series of skillful escapes, they trap Michael in the gas room and blow up the hospital. The Good News: This is the most graphic of the sequels, partly because there are so many kills in here. We have a nice shot of a melted face, a hammer-smashed skull, a needle sticking out of an eye, and shrapnel fragments embedded in the face. Michael also gets his eyes shot out, but only the blood flow from it is seen. He also slashes a throat, but that is a moot point considering the other kills. While I'm thinking of it, I would like to comment on the needle scene. We never see the needle thrust in, just the after-affect, but that whole sequence is a prime example of how true horror films use mood to get scares. A nurse wanders into a doctors' office to call him in for duty, but his back is turned and he doesn't respond to his name. The nurse walks up to him and turns the chair around to see him dead. She silently staggers back out of the room, but behind her in the dark, Michael's mask slowly forms above her head. He lunges at her and plants another needle in her face. It is a brilliant sequence that has quickly become one of my favorites because of three classic elements: The low lighting in the room, the innocent victim, and the killer's appearance in the scene. These three elements come together to form the scene. With the low lighting in the room, shadows are cast around, allowing for Michael to easily hide in. the helpless victim is his target, and the slow formation of his mask behind her are very chilling upon first watch. This scene alone is worth the price of admission, but what guarantees it is the nude scenes of the nurse played by Pamela Susan Shoop. She has a very nice body for that time, and the scene is pretty tasteful, without it being done simply for the sake of showing nudity. Following a classic slasher rule, she is immediately killed for doing so, and her death is another highlight. I don't want to give too much away, but it is a great scene that is very eerie. After dispatching her companion, Michael secretly turns up the temperature in the therapeutic pool where they are, and comes out to Shoop, who believes it is her companion. She talks to him for several seconds, then asks him a question, and when he doesn't respond, she looks up at him and sees that it isn't Michael, who promptly dispatches her as well. Another great highlight, as it continues on, is the discovery of Laurie and Michael's relationship. For the three of us left who don't know, Laurie is revealed to be Michael's brother who was hid from him after he was sent to prison. This is the storyline that set up `Halloween: H2O' and it is discovered her. Of the entire competent cast, Pleasance as always does a respectable job as Loomis. I think he has finally come to terms with the role, and he has a lot of fun with it.         The Bad News: Despite getting a top billing, Jamie is essentially wasted in the movie. She lies in her hospital bed for most of the movie, and when the staff starts disappearing, she finally wanders out and finds Michael. It wasn't a great decision to do so, as it left her out of action for most of the movie. This really is my only gripe against the movie.The Final Verdict: Following such a successful film like `Halloween' is a tough act for any film, but this one manages to pull it off in strides. It is thoroughly entertaining all the way through, it isn't as graphic as it could've been, and it has a high re-watch ability factor. This is definitely the best of the sequels and is tied with part 4 as the most entertaining of the sequels. It is highly recommended to all fans of the original and slasher fans of any kind.

101,vengeance20,Better Than The Original!,7,11 October 2021,"So, having recently seen the first Halloween on Netflix after so long, I come across this one & start watching. I recently watched this one last year & still remember even after watching it once before, it being pretty good.The film follows Laurie Strode right after the events at the end of the first film going to hospital in Haddonfeild. But Michael Myers is done & continues his pursuit of Laurie which sees him, the Doctors, Nurses, Police & Loomis using the hospital as a battle ground.I found the film to be more improved & fleshed out than the first. I know the first film was meant to be more about shock factor, but films had changed dramatically over the 3 year hiatus, so them making the sequel more violent & graphic was good & a step up improvement, not to mention a higher body count too.The characters were good & we see a couple of them return for the sequel here. The pacing was better this time around & the action & terror were beefed up along with some added eye candy for good measure. The run time is a little shorter but much the same at 1 hour & 28 minutes.Overall, it's an improvement over the first film which lacked in gore, action & body count. This was pretty good I think.7/10.",Halloween II
102,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Halloween II""- Obviously inferior to the outstanding original, but still suspenseful, enjoyable and eerie-as-hell.",7,3 January 2015,"The tragedy of ""Halloween II"" (a genuinely enjoyable, albeit flawed movie) really boils down to one big issue- it's a good film that suffered a bit of an identity crisis during production.The story goes that director Rick Rosenthal wanted the sequel to feel like an organic continuation of the original, so he eschewed the growing clichés of the slasher-horror genre, and instead directed a film that was more subdued, slow and provocative. However, with the reign of slasher-horror dominating theaters (thanks to films like ""Friday the 13th""- a film inspired by John Carpenter's original ""Halloween""), co-writer John Carpenter supposedly got cold feet, thinking audiences wouldn't accept the film if it didn't feature plenty of gore and nudity. So, according to Hollywood legend, Carpenter added several sequences of harsh violence and nudity in order to make the film feel more like the other slasher flicks of the day.And I think that's the issue. While I've heard director Rosenthal's original cut was comparatively tame, I think that all-in-all, it would have been a somewhat stronger film than the one we got. The added gore and sex just sort-of harms the film, by making it feel more conformist and cliché compared to the original.The film again follows the two separate story lines of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Picking up right after the original, Laurie is hospitalized and Loomis teams up with Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) to continue his search for the murderous Michael Myers (Dick Warlock). However, their paths are destined to cross again, as eventually, Loomis realizes that Michael has a twisted connection to Laurie, and has finally tracked her down to the hospital, where he begins a new killing spree in his attempt to murder her.The cast (while limited) is generally as good as the original. Jamie Lee Curtis continues to make for a wonderful, enjoyable heroine that you can't help but root for. And Pleasence, though a bit more over- the-top this time around, still gives a phenomena of a performance as Dr. Loomis. It's surprising that, through most of the sequels, Pleasence stuck around (appearing in every Michael-centric entry of the franchise until his death), while most slasher-film actors tend to bail. And it's even more surprising how committed he stayed to the role. Pleasence was always the highlight of each film, and this is no different.Director Rosenthal does a fairly good job with the material he's given. (Though Carpenter did direct the aforementioned added scenes) Much like Carpenter, he's keen to give us tasteful, long shots that build mood and atmosphere. Though I do think a few of his visual choices come across as sloppy, and a few scenes don't quite make sense when really looked at. (A scene where Loomis chases someone he believes to be Michael, only to have it end in a fiery bloodbath, is very suspicious when watched again. It isn't quite communicated well- enough.)The script by Carpenter and collaborator Debra Hill has a lot going for it, yet also has some really big issues. While it has a good pacing and some interesting twists and turns, portions of it feel contrived and sloppy. And new characters seem a bit too one- dimensional. (Such as a character who is only defined by a really lousy, over-the-top obsession with sex... to the point he even sings about it at one point.) But I do think it's a very solid effort overall, and I admire Carpenter and Hill's attempts to expand on the mythology of the series.Overall, I think this is definitely a solidly-constructed and very entertaining sequel. It never quite measures up to the original, but it's interesting script, solid direction and great performances make it well worth checking out for fans of the original, and for fans of horror in general.I give ""Halloween II"" a solid 7 out of 10.",Halloween II
103,elliotjeory,Could of been better,5,1 November 2018,"This film wasn't a patch on the first. First of all the main character Laurie is hardly on it she spends most of the film in a hospital bed. We are then left with annoying hospital staff which are not particularly interesting.
One scene has the police run over a teenager is a Michael Myers mask who then bursts into flames. As the teenager burns alive they then drive off because they have to find the real Michael. It was bizarre. The film is set in a large hospital yet there are only around 5 staff including 2 paramedics. The film is also very slow and only really gets going near the end.
This was a rushed film and they should of put more effort into it. Instead we have a series of inadequate films that should of been a lot better.",Halloween II
104,m-47826,"Halloween falls on Friday the 13th, this year...",3,1 November 2021,"I'm not gonna lie. It is clear studios wanted to compete with less brain, more blood approach of Friday the 13th. The new characters are just as annoying and have « to be killed off soon », carved on their foreheads. Some ideas were good, like trying to explain why Michael Myers is impossible to kill, after being shot six.... Seven times! Making him Laurie's brother, didn't bother me. I even thought it gave a new meaning to him stalking this seemingly random girl. For what? Making fun of his house? I don't buy it. The kills however, were unnecessarily violent. Not in a gore way, but too over the top for the eerie and slow paced atmosphere of the franchise. Speaking of which, it takes too long to take off. But like in the first film, once it does, there are some interesting chase scenes and semi good frights. I like the hospital setting, but think it wasn't used to its full advantage, at the start of the movie, and during some of the death scenes. The only thing I really like, is how it is perfectly linked to the 1978 movie, even if it was released three years later. And all the returning cast, especially nurse Marion and Loomis, giving this sequel something more to hold on to. I don't hate it, but it is not as good as it should've been and not for reasons the writer/director clearly thinks...",Halloween II
105,arungeorge13,"A far cry from the brilliance of Carpenter's original, but remains watchable! [+56%]",6,7 October 2020,"An extension of the original Halloween storyline featuring Laurie Strode, Michael Myers, and Dr. Samuel Loomis, Halloween II feels like a less atmospheric, gorier side-piece than a truly memorable sequel. Carpenter and Hill have written the screenplay, which mostly takes place within the premises of the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital where Strode is admitted after her earlier confrontation with Myers. While the kill-count in Halloween II may be higher than in Carpenter's film, the Rick Rosenthal directorial terribly lacks that edgy, out-of-the-blue feel. The musical score by Carpenter is fine (an overkill at times), but the twist (in other words, the big reveal) that he incorporated into the script toward the end of the film was appalling. That it is explained in a totally irrelevant scene featuring Loomis and his colleague, only makes it worse.The supporting characters in Halloween II aren't the best-written ones. The hot tub kill scene was crafted well, but several others felt unimaginative. It was obviously more fun seeing Myers wreak havoc in random Haddonfield households than taking out hospital staff one by one. Jamie Lee Curtis' screen-time in Halloween II is significantly lesser as compared to the first, and that final showdown between her and Myers turned out to be plain vanilla. However, where Halloween II succeeds is in making you feel like the story is continuing exactly where the first film ends. Yeah, the night was just getting started!If you're new to the franchise, I'd recommend that you watch Carpenter's 1978 original and the 2018 sequel. Later, if you feel like watching a retconned companion piece from the '80s, then this ought to be it. Ignore all the other sequels.",Halloween II
106,rivertam26,Entertaining but flawed,8,23 February 2020,I go back and forth with this sequel. The original is a Superior film but this is also one of the best horror sequels. Picking up right after the events of the first film Michael follows Laurie to the local hospital and begins to wreak havoc. The movie is creepy with an atmospheric execution from Rick Rosenthal. It only falters a bit when it gives into the cliched slasher tropes and some stuff just does not make sense. From the iv kill to the whole sister angle even though it gives the film reason to exist. That being said it's very entertaining but the ending in which Michael gets his eyes shot out kinda ruins the whole franchise until the 2018 reboot.,Halloween II
107,Analog_Devotee,A very enjoyable horror sequel; perfect for a double-feature,9,3 June 2020,"I saw both Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981) in one night, back when I watched them for the first time. I was a little worried going into it that it might not be as good, since people enjoy crapping all over sequels before giving them a fair shake, but I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed it.Donald Pleasence's performance as Dr. Sam Loomis is just as legendary and memorable in this film as it was in the original. It's safe to say, in my opinion, that his role in these films was just as important (if not more important) as Michael Myers's.This film picks up right where the original left off, only this time, we spend most of our time in a hospital. I think the setting for the hospital is very unique, but certainly could've been handled a little better. For one, it feels very, very empty. On one hand, I enjoy the emptiness of the hospital, because it adds another element of eeriness and suspense. But on the other hand, it does feel pretty unrealistic, even if Haddonfield is a small town.Jamie Lee Curtis's role in this film is quite minimal. Not awful, but not good, either.The budget was much larger with this film, and it definitely shows in certain scenes. The gore was also upped, which some people seem to gripe about, but I thoroughly enjoyed the goriness. I disagree that gore is a cheap way to get scares, and that it ruins suspense, like so many people here claim. You can have suspense and gore in the same film.The ending is also very satisfying, both in plot and aesthetic. All in all, I suggest jumping straight into this film as soon as you finish the original. Easily the best double-feature you'll ever experience!***8/23/21: Watched with the audio commentary of director Rick Rosenthal and Leo Rossi.It was just okay, honestly. These guys obviously have a good friendship but their chemistry doesn't make for very engaging conversation. Rick takes the lead a couple of times and points out a few interesting tidbits (such as when Loomis acquires the yellow lighter used at the end of the film; something I'd missed even with all my rewatches over the years) but they're few and far between. There are a lot of uncomfortable silences throughout that last way too long, and since the audio of the film is nearly silent, it can make for a dull experience. I know they're reliving the movie themselves, but this was pretty disappointing compared to some of the other commentaries I've watched recently.Three may be a crowd, but it probably could've done wonders here. I believe there's a separate commentary with Dick Warlock; I'll be checking it out soon.",Halloween II
108,chris_gaskin123,He's not dead after all...,8,4 December 2006,"Halloween 2 is probably the best of the many sequels to the original Halloween from 1978.It starts where Halloween left off. Myers is not dead, despite Dr Loomis putting six bullets in him. Laurie Strode is rushed to hospital and Myers is not far behind. It's not long before staff at the hospital are being bumped off. Myers kills his victims in several different ways, including a syringe, strangling and a knife once again. We also get to know why Myers particularly wants Laurie dead, she turns out to be his long lost sister. She also falls in love with one of the hospital staff, a driver, Jimmy.Although not quite as good the original, Halloween 2 is certainly creepy throughout.Reprising their roles from Halloween are Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie, Donald Pleasence as Dr Loomis and Charles Cyphers. Lance Guest plays Laurie's lover Jimmy.Halloween 2 is certainly worth checking out. Not bad at all.Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.",Halloween II
109,Sergiodave,Best Horror Sequel,7,31 October 2021,"While this sequel isn't as good as the original, as a movie it's far better most sequels of any genre. The fact that the movie starts immediately after 'Halloween' this is a continuation rather than the usual Horror sequel rehashing. Donald Pleasence is definitely the star of this movie whilst Jamie Lee Curtis, though central to the story, takes a supporting role, so some of the acting is a bit better! The 80's version of the Halloween theme music using a synthesizer is awful and the murders lack surprise and originality; but it has a good tight plot and kept you interested throughout. I honestly can't think of a better horror sequel.",Halloween II
110,baumer,Just as scary as the original,9,26 June 1999,"As sequels go, this isn't a better movie than the original, but what it is and what it does well, it does really well.  I have to say right away here that I was scared in this movie.  There are some truly ingenious and horrific shots in this film.  There are times when you really aren't expecting what's about to transpire, and when it does, it sends chills through you.I first saw this film in my "" horror "" days in the mid 80's.  I was 12 years old then.  So I just recently watched it again to see if it would have the same affect on me now.  I sat in my basement and turned off all the lights and you know what, I was spooked.  Right from the opening number of Carpenter's ominous music and the pumpkin slowly transforming into Michael's angry face, I knew right there that I was in for a night of fear.  And I was.The story starts the same night as Halloween ended on.  Laurie is being taken to the hospital and there is a massive manhunt to find Myers. Laurie eventually gets settled into the hospital and it becomes only a matter of time until Michael can find out where she is.  He finally comes to get her and then all hell breaks loose.One of the major players in this film is the locale.  The hospital is dark and quiet and rather empty.  And that adds to the atmosphere of the film. It gives us lots of long hallways so we can have a few shots of Michael hunting his prey.  What we also get is an array of rooms to 86 his victims in and a slew of weapons to do it with.Rick Rosenthal directed this film and I am amazed that he really didn't go on to do much because he almost copies Carpenter's style to the tee here. Brilliant in particular are two shots.  One is where Michael appears out of the darkness in one room to attack his victim.  The lighting is solely responsible for the affectiveness of this shot and it works so well that it still gives me the shivers when I watch it.  The second is when Micael attacks one of the nurses while Laurie watched helplessly from a distance.Not only is this a good horror movie, it is a good film and if the first rates a 10/10, this is certainly of a 9.  It is that good.  And if you don't agree with me, watch it again---by yourself and then answer that question.",Halloween II

112,gedikreverdi,It's time Michael,6,4 August 2021,It's on the same night as the first film. It takes place mainly at the hospital and the final girl is drugged and in a hospital bed for the majority of the film. She can't run and she can't scram and we're left with those not-so-interesting hospital staff. The hospital is huge but there are only a few nurses and two paramedics and no police officers whatsoever. The telephone lines are cut and the technician was killed. The paramedic and the nurse were killed in the therapy room. The nurse was drown in the boiling hot water in the bathtub and it reminded me of that scene from Profondo Rosso which is way better than this. The rest of the staff got killed in pretty uninteresting ways. Dr. Loomis finally arrived at the hospital by threatening the officer and shot Myers many times again but nope he's not dying. In the surgery room Laurie shot him in the eye and he couldn't see and Dr. Loomis exploded the room with oxygen tanks and both died as it seemed. The kid that wore Myers mask burnt at a car crash and they examined his charred body and it was brutal yet pretty awkward. Laurie survived and Dr. Loomis is dead and he was the most interesting character and Myers burnt but of course he's not dead. He's the boogeyman.,Halloween II
113,mentalcritic,"Every cliché in the book, and then some",1,24 October 2004,"In the 1980s, the home video market was just beginning to start, and numerous horror franchises saw a chance to increase their income by selling to two markets. As a result, horror films began to pirate one another left and right, while the franchises themselves seemed to be mostly bereft of ideas. There are some franchises, such as Friday The 13th, that recycle so much that one could be forgiven for forgetting which episode they are watching. Halloween II has more in common with Friday The 13th than it does the original Halloween.In spite of the massive continuity error early on in the film, it picks up more or less exactly where the original left off. Michael Myers has survived his encounter with slugs from Doctor Loomis' pistol, and is wandering around the suburbs of Haddonfield, killing people almost entirely at random. This, in essence, is the problem with the entire film. Whereas the first film took the time to properly set up a cast of victims and make the audience care about them, Halloween II's entire cast can be summed up as ""anonymous boring girl/guy"".Another problem is that the entire film has Michael walking along at a sluggish, almost retarded pace. I've seen people who have more Thorazine than blood in their veins move faster than Michael does here. As a result, the critical audience is tempted to yell ""hey, anonymous boring girl, try jogging, he'll never catch up with you"". It's one thing to have a slow-moving monster who eventually catches his victim through sheer persistence (or stupidity on the victim's part), but when rooms have multiple exits, or the monster casually strolls in one someone in the sauna, credulity just doesn't apply.This marks the first time that the anonymous long-lost relative plot device was used in the Halloween series. In the original, we had no idea why Michael was tracking down Laurie. The plot synopsis on the video box simply tells us that he wants to relive his crime. Halloween II simply tells us without any establishing shots that Laurie is Michael's other sister, who was adopted shortly before or after the original murder shown in the first film's prologue. Footage of Loomis examining official files, or even a walk-on cameo appearing for the sole reason of explaining this plot element, would have been nice.Another idiotic moment comes when we discover the name Samhain written in blood upon a wall. For hours after that point, we get minutes of dialogue about old pagan gods and the unconscious mind that is so stilted one cannot help but laugh at it. One has to wonder if Donald Pleasance was under contractual obligation to appear in this sequel, because it is hard to imagine a respectable actor appearing in a film like this out of a desire to work with the new cast and crew, or to revist the story.I gave Halloween II a one out of ten. I think I am being extremely fair given that the film is boring, overlong, and contains some of the worst padding yet to appear in a horror sequel.",Halloween II

115,ODDBear,Not as good as the original but hey...,6,11 March 2004,"Begins immediately after Halloween's conclusion. Michael Myers is on the run after failing to kill Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis). Laurie is sent to the town's hospital and Michael pursues her there, killing off the staff in the proceedings. Meanwhile, Michael's doctor, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is trying desperately to find him, and kill him.Not as good as the original but then who expected that? This is more in the fashion of Friday the 13th, the body count is heavier and the slashings are merely random, you really don't care who gets slashed and why. The order of the day seems to be added gore and less suspense, though the film does have it's highlights, particularly in the second half. Rick Rosenthal is nowhere near as good a director as Carpenter, the suspense scenes are way too long and completely telegraphed way ahead. Jamie Lee Curtis is solid, but we mostly hear her scream her lungs out. She really doesn't have that much to do. Donald Pleasence is OK, not as good as in the first one due mostly to some hysterical overacting at times. The Shape (portrayed here by a stuntman instead of Nick Castle) is pretty decent, but not as good as Nick Castle was in the original. There's simply something missing. In short; nothing in Halloween II is as good as in the original. It has more deaths, more violence, more gore but less suspense, less tension and less entertainment value. Still, it's solid, and that's about the best one could expect from it.",Halloween II

With none of the set up of the first movie, Halloween 2 comes off as a flat, by the numbers retread with none of the suspense of the original. Because Halloween 2 focuses on action more than character, we never care whether anyone is wiped out or not,as they're nothing but characters in a slasher flick. Perhaps i'm hard on Halloween 2, especially given the fact on how much I love the first movie, however there is no imagination taken with the series and it's clear that Rick Rosenthal has no idea how to advance the story. Especially since we know who the killer is, there is no set up and it's just a dull turkey-shoot of victims getting it one by one. This would be entertaining but the gore pales in comparison to the Friday The 13th series. So all in all a very disappointing sequel.*1/2 out of 4-(Poor)",Halloween II
117,one9eighty,"Great concept for a sequel, not as well delivered though",6,4 February 2019,"Following on directly from the first Halloween film, Michael Myers is still on the loose and Laurie Strode is at the hospital getting treated for the injuries she received at his hands. Michael, intent on hunting Laurie down and finishing what he started continues his blood thirsty rampage in her direction.While this is a passable film and a decent sequel it's nowhere near as good as the first film. It tries to imitate the first one in a big way but is noticeably short. I like the fact that it's supposed to be set straight after the first film - that's nice to see in sequels. However it doesn't carry across the eerie suspense and tension with the continuation of the story. It also fails to bring as much action as it possibly could have while being set in the quietist hospital A&E department known to man. There are quite a few goofs, and some noticeable inaccuracies for die-hard fans of horror or the first film. It also introduces a concept that, while unexpected, is that far leftfield that it's practically stupid (the relationship between Strode and Myers).It's probably fair to say that Rick Rosenthal (director) has made a cheap imitation, but he doesn't achieve the levels that John Carpenter did in the first film. It feels like an idea has been cashed in quickly to achieve finances, rather than an idea being produced because it's quality and adds to the cannon. Pity, handled differently this had the promise to be one of the best sequels made. In this instance I rate this a 6 out of 10 - still enjoyable enough, but not worth stopping what you are doing to go out of your way for it.",Halloween II

Not to worry, Dr. Loomis (Pleasance) is on his way.The gore is prominent in this sequel, moreso than in the first, where most was implied.  Not here; blood, deep cuts, gashes, impalements, scaldings...it's all here, and in great detail.  You even get a hypodermic needle in the eyeball not once but TWICE!  Michael must have been running out of ideas by then.Pleasance seems more of an irritant in this sequel than before.  So much so that he is being escorted out of town by the police at one point.  They all seemed to get along so well in the original.Curtis was more resourceful in the original, too.  Here she just runs, runs, runs.  Too bad.And speaking of ""too"", two stars for this ""Part II"".By the way: if you were to get shot in both eyes, wouldn't the bullets go into your brain and kill you instantly?I thought so.",Halloween II
119,stamper,"This movie really sucks, though it also raises 2 interesting questions I'd like to ask John Carpenter one day",3,29 October 2000,"1. Why can Michael Myers not be killed? OK in this one (as far as I have seen the movie, for I stopped after 80 minutes cause I was bored to death) it would have been possible for Myers to survive if he had worn a bullet  proof west and had only been shot like one time in the arm or so. But if you watch these series on and on it becomes more ridiculous. Like in H20, when you are sure he is dead, but no next year comes the next film of the series. So what is that dude a robot?
2. Why does he walk so damn slow? Well in this movie Myers could have killed that stupid Strode girl easily if he had sped up a pace or two, but he never does do that, WHY??
This movie SUCKS like HELL.

120,fernandoschiavi,"It's not as revolutionary or memorable as the classic that inspired it, but Halloween II offers more thriller sequences and well-crafted atmosphere",6,28 August 2021,"""Halloween 2"" was the first attempt to explore the characters by squeezing the story for more box office success. After all, the iconic Michael Myers had barely ushered in the era of slasher movies - those with masked villains hunting teenagers with knives and other sharp phallic objects - and was already losing to ""Friday the 13th""'s Jason in the number of works released in the era. This time, John Carpenter repeated the partnership with Debra Hill only in the script, ceding the position of director to the then newcomer Rick Rosenthal. The sequel's premise takes advantage of the open ending of the original to continue the story right where it left off. To remember, psychopathic killer Michael Myers has just been shot by Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) after attacking young Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in a house in a quiet, middle-class US suburb. However, her body disappears, indicating that she may not have died, and the town of Haddonfield begins to take notice of the atrocities that took place that Halloween night.After Michael flees the house while Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) recover, we see Michael prowling the neighborhood, hiding and taking more victims. Laurie is sent to the hospital, where she is admitted. Of course Michael doesn't give up, creating more chaos in the city and going to the hospital to finish what he started. At the hospital, we meet the new characters: The two paramedics Jimmy and Budd, the head nurse Ms. Alves, nurses Karen, Janet and Jill, and guard Garrett. As Michael surreptitiously kills each one, Laurie is practically drugged and begins to have memories of being adopted. Dr. Loomis, the sheriff, and Marion, a nurse at a mental hospital, try to find out where Michael is, while trying to deal with the fact that Laurie is Michael's younger sister, which is the reason for all the harassment.There are few films considered as sequels that managed to maintain the quality of their original, and even more, that really continued the story from the exact moment where the previous one ended. Halloween II (1981), by Rick Rosenthal, can be considered one of those rare cases, and that together with his previous film form an interesting story of approximately 3 hours in length. Halloween II has a lot more killing, violence and action than its previous film, the 1978 classic directed by John Carpenter, which is more oriented towards psychological suspense in a story conducted at a more lilting pace. And in this sequel, the invulnerability of the maniac Michael Myers was evident, reinforcing his immortal characteristic and extraordinary strength that would be exhaustively explored in the following films, through his contemptuous reaction to the countless revolver shots that would easily liquidate a normal human being. In the original film, this characteristic did not exist, bringing the psychopath closer to a man of common strength, differentiated only in his violent attitudes and in his thirst for revenge and murderous fury.In addition, there is an attempt to expand the horror from new themes, such as the fear of hospitals and their drugs, injections and scalpels, and the reaction of a city unprepared to face evil personified. The film is a warning that one can no longer live with unlocked doors and inefficient padlocks, since violence does not need a reason or an explanation for it to happen. A recurring reference to George A. Romero's zombies reinforces discussions about the relationship between supernatural terror and our society. The message to 1980s viewers is that even the quietest place is no longer safe from harm.Locating much of the plot inside a hospital ensures a certain freshness, especially since it's not the kind of environment we're used to seeing in horror movies. If the duo takes advantage of this for the more graphic scenes, such as bringing Michael using scalpels and even spa pools as a weapon, it lacks the artificiality of having medical characters with a true adolescent spirit, descending into clichéd escapist sex and completely evil written. A horror movie fate, yes, but that doesn't really help here, and the supporting cast can do little to win our interest - including Donald Pleasence, whose character has been turned into the most impulsive and crazed therapist I've ever seen.The story takes place at night as darkness further reinforces a gloomy mood of death hanging over the small town of Haddonfield, with a dangerous assassin loose in the streets and tearing at the flesh of his victims. However, it is inevitable not to notice a grotesque flaw in the script regarding the hospital where Laurie was admitted, and where Myers went and significantly increased the local death rate. In a completely improbable situation, the hospital was all the time too dark and too empty, facilitating the actions of the psychopath, who, incidentally, did not even have to worry about the police, who was always far away.Finally, while not a John Carpenter, then-rookie Rick Rosenthal is quite effective at recreating the atmosphere and technique of the first film. We have some footage from Michael's POV, the old long shot trick where we see the killer approaching from behind (unbeknownst to the characters) and a working light and shadow play, especially during the moment when the protagonist need to hide in a parking lot. Rosenthal even bets on long shots where nothing actually shows up on the scene, like when Laurie crawls across the hospital floor, waiting for an attack from Myers that never really comes; something that also enables a good work for the actress. And, of course, the iconic theme composed by Carpenter (here, in a contribution with Alan Howarth) perfectly punctuates the more hectic sections of the chase.An interesting curiosity in Halloween II was the homage that John Carpenter and Rick Rosenthal paid to fellow filmmaker George A. Romero, when the doorman and hospital guard has the television on to distract himself on his night shift and the classic is being shown absolute horror The Night of the Living Dead, 1968), the first film in Romero's famous zombie trilogy. This kind of homage has been done before in the 1978 original film, when nanny Laurie is babysitting two children, and the television was showing scenes from two great science fiction classics, The Arctic Monster (The Thing, 1951). By Howard Hawks, and Forbidden Planet, 1956 by Fred McLeod Wilcox.It's not as revolutionary or memorable as the classic that inspired it, but Halloween II offers more thriller sequences and well-crafted atmosphere, as well as an exceptional performance by Jamie Lee Curtis, as well as more moments of Michael Myers establishing himself as one of the definitive slashers. It's just a pity that the producers have bet on a new and forced mythology, paving the way for a franchise where slashing would be a trademark. This second part is still a good example of the original vintage of slasher movies and deserves to be checked, even if the freshness of the original has been lost between the bloated budget and the Hollywood need to show more and kill more with each new continuation of works of this nature.",Halloween II

He goes after his other sister named Laurie Strode, a bookworm who tries to babysit two kids while learning that that the bogeyman is out there to get here. It became a big hit and spawned this second entry of the saga three years later named ""Halloween II"".When I first saw this after having been enthralled by the original, I wasn't expecting this to be as excellent, but at least have the spirit and tone of the original. Sure, it lacks the suspense of the first and Michael Myers was shown a bit too much, not to mention the poorly lit hospital which was pretty scary, yet very confusing at the same time, but that doesn't matter for they seem to be outweighed by it's redeeming factors.The acting is great thanks to an ensemble cast, the direction from Rick Rosenthal is decent, the pacing is well-paced, the death scenes, much like the original, are unforgettable and the music from Alan Horvath is at the same depth as the original's music for being quite atmospheric which fits the tone of the movie perfectly.I can understand why lots of people, including Halloween fans, hated this sequel especially the critics, but I thought this is a decent sequel to a great classic.

123,Libretio,"OK sequel, not as bad as some reviews have suggested",5,24 February 2005,"HALLOWEEN II Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: Dolby StereoFollowing her ordeal in the original HALLOWEEN (1978), Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to hospital, where she's pursued by the murderous Michael Myers.Fraught with production difficulties and critically reviled upon its original theatrical release, Rick Rosenthal's entertaining sequel manages to defy low expectations, despite a ho-hum script by co-producers John Carpenter and Debra Hill. Some of the first film's key personnel have returned for the sequel, including ace cinematographer Dean Cundey, who uses the wide Panavision frame in painterly fashion, thereby ensuring a visual uniformity between the two productions. The movie opens with a memorable title sequence - set to Carpenter's immortal theme music, enhanced by a Dolby soundtrack - in which a spectral jack o'lantern dissolves into a grinning skull, setting a tone which Rosenthal sustains throughout the entire picture.The opening fifteen minutes are terrific, an exhilarating combination of atmosphere, suspense and impressive visual technique. But the narrative quickly succumbs to routine plotting and a series of mediocre set-pieces, centered around one of the most understaffed hospitals in movie history! Donald Pleasence gets all the best lines in his role as the haunted Dr. Loomis (""We're all afraid of the dark inside ourselves""), and Curtis does her best with an underwritten role, though few of the actors are stretched by the material. The gore quotient has been upped this time around, the result of post-production tampering by Carpenter, who added extra 'kill' footage against Rosenthal's wishes, and there's a plot twist at the halfway mark which probably contributed to the film's poor reception in 1981. Nice touches abound, however, including a ghostly flashback to Laurie's childhood as she comes face to face with the young Michael Myers; and the tears of blood which roll down the killer's face during his final showdown with the survivors of his grisly rampage. For all its flaws, the movie has much to recommend it, and was followed by the unrelated (and poorly conceived) HALLOWEEN III: SEASON OF THE WITCH (1982).",Halloween II

125,tonypeacock-1,What a disappointment. Sequel syndrome come in.,4,12 October 2018,"What a disappointment, especially in comparison to its ground breaking prequel Halloween.I suppose when this film was released in 1981, sequels and film franchises were a relatively new phenomenon.
The film definitely suffers from sequel syndrome.However even when looking at the film as a lone entity it is disappointing in terms of having little horror impact.There are only so many times you can have a camera panning behind the Michael Myers character to a synthesizer beat.The film is not directed by John Carpenter now. He has producing and part musical input. Director duties fall to Rick Rosenthal.It basically follows straight on from the events of Halloween. Even a few seconds footage from the end of that film appear at the beginning of this.
Jamie Lee Curtis now shares top billing with Donald Pleasence.Lee Curtis appears visibly more mature in the 3 year gap between the films.I rated the first film 10 but I am struggling to give this 4!
How the franchise dragged on for relentless more sequels I will never know.

Blood and gore are turned up in this one as Michael Myers kills twice as many people as he did in the original.A bit surprised when I found out this was supposed to be the movie where Michael Myers dies but got rebooted later on.

127,barryrd,Sequel succeeds,7,29 September 2009,"It is not quite up to the original, which was shot on a limited budget and used timing, lighting and minimal dialogue to great effect. However, it nicely picks up where Halloween left off... with the dark, eerie streets and lane-ways of Haddonfield, the great acting combination of Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance, and the return the masked monster known as Michael Myers. Again, the music and darkness are used to maximum effect. This movie is more graphic than the first. We witness fires, strangulations, hammer blows, gunshots and even boiling water being used as weapons. But even so, the images are often more imagined than real. We see what Michael's release has wrought on the town of Haddonfield, which innocently seems to resist the shock of what is happening until the carnage is almost complete. There is more killing in this movie but the music, camera work and lighting are still effectively used as the story moves from one murder to another. The murderer is never shown but we do follow his movements through the lens of the camera and at the end, we take satisfaction in another good entertainment.",Halloween II
128,Prichards12345,A pretty decent sequel to the original,7,2 November 2015,"I have to admit I avoided Halloween II for many years as I'm not all that keen on slasher movie sequels. Most of them are cheap knock-offs designed to extract a bit more cash from gore hound teenagers, providing unsubtle laughs like the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise.Halloween II is different, however, and I'm glad I finally caught up with it. There are quite a few plot inconsistencies and the characters behave downright stupidly at times. But the schema of having Michael Myers hang out around the local hospital searching for his sister, polishing off whomever he crosses provides a pretty good movie overall.The film is a bit too gory for my tastes and some of the murders are undeniably nasty - the original Halloween was far subtler and much less bloody, but nonetheless this is an engaging and effective film, with a good performance from Donald Pleasence to give it some heart.Michael Myers' screen adventures should have ended here, however, for it could only go downhill (and did). His inability to die, in spite of having at least 11 bullets in him by the end of the movie, was explained in a later sequel, one that was later retconned. Hmmm. Never liked this angle, and it went unexplained in the first two movies.Season of Witch, which followed it, was a damn good film, original script by Nigel Kneale, no less, before it was changed and he removed his name from the credits. Still, as sequels go this one works and does not disgrace the original.",Halloween II
129,Superunknovvn,As good as the original (if not better),6,15 January 2006,"Personally, I've never been a huge fan of the ""Halloween"" franchise. Maybe I've become blunted to quiet serial killers from watching countless slasher movies. Compared to Jason or Freddy, Michael Myers has always seemed a bit slow and unimaginative for my taste and the much praised first part is no exception to that. However, I'm not trying to put down those movies, I just want to make clear that it's no sacrilege for me to compare this second part to the holy grail that is the original for a lot of fans.The story picks up right where ""Halloween"" ended. Laurie has survived the first part of the night and is taken to the hospital. As we know, Michael Myers has not been killed by Doctor Loomis and is still on the loose. He continues his killing spree and follows Laurie to the hospital to finish what he has begun a few hours earlier. Along the way we learn a few things about Michael's and Laurie's past.In many aspects ""Halloween II"" is even superior to its predecessor. There are a lot more kills and some of them are even a bit creative (burning/drowning a girl in a tub, jab to the eye) whereas the first movie (and most that would follow) often doesn't go beyond Michael Myers stabbing someone or slitting throats. Apparently, John Carpenter himself went back and added some explicit violence as he thought the finished version by Rick Rosenthal was too tame. Bless his soul! I think what a lot of people like best about ""Halloween"" compared to other slasher flicks, though, is that it relies more on suspense than gore. And ""Halloween II"" does indeed give you a lot of suspense. Although it doesn't seem like that when you read the story on paper, the hospital actually makes for a pretty good horror movie setting with its dark corridors and observation cameras.Plotwise the story develops a bit without moving as ridiculously far away from the original premise as some of the sequels did. That's not saying ""Halloween II"" doesn't have its share of ridiculousness. Dr. Loomis makes for a few unintentionally funny moments when he chases a completely innocent young guy down the road until he winds up in a horrible accident or when he threatens police officers with a gun to do as he says. Most of the time it's totally predictable where Michael Myers will pop up and who will die next, but then you must not forget that the slasher genre was still pretty new back in 1981 and that audiences were not yet as hard boiled as they are today.All in all, ""Halloween II"" is a worthy successor to the original. It may not be a genre cornerstone like part 1, but it's just as entertaining, if not more so. Unbelievable that this was made by Rick Rosenthal, the same guy who would later be responsible for the worst entry in the franchise (""Halloween: Resurrection""), but even John Carpenter himself hasn't exactly developed positively the last 15 years or so, has he? Just goes to show how hard it is to stay fresh in the horror genre.",Halloween II
130,ersinkdotcom,"""Halloween II"" Blu-ray features plenty of bonus material and hi-res transfer",8,1 October 2012,"Many look at this sequel as the unwanted imitator of the original that upped the gore ante and added cheap jump moments where genuine ones of suspense once were. However, there's a legion of fans out there of the franchise that carry a treaty loyalty to the film and its cast and creators. ""Halloween II"" begins exactly at the end of the original film. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) runs downstairs into the front yard of the house he found Michael Myers (Dick Warlock) and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in. He discovers that Myers has walked off from the spot where he landed after Loomis shot him several times knocking him off the 2nd story balcony. Laurie is rushed to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital where she's admitted for treatment. Michael tracks her down to the hospital and begins killing the medical personnel one by one in his search for Laurie. Can Dr. Loomis track him down and end his reign of terror before Myers can get to his sister? Is ""Halloween II"" as good as or better than its predecessor? Of course not. Is it good in its own right as an entertaining slasher film? I believe it is. Director Rick Rosenthal did what any man picking up the reigns from a master like John Carpenter would. First, he uses the same director of photography to capture the movie visually. Next, Rosenthal tries to hang on to the suspense that made the first movie a hit, but at the same time add more moments of gore to elevate it to a different level. Did it work all the time? No, it didn't. However, it did add all sorts of iconic moments that viewers still hang on to and celebrate to this day. Moments like the blood running down Myers' mask after Laurie shoots him in the eyes; the swishing of the scalpel as he blindly swings it in front of him trying to kill whoever gets in his way; the POV shots of the killer stalking while we hear his heavy breathing under the mask; and who can forget the scene where the mother is taking her little boy to the emergency room after he bit into an apple with a razor in it? That put Halloween in a bad light from the moment it first debuted in front of an audience. It's great to see a cast give such genuine performances in what many actors might write off as an opportunity to just pick up an easy paycheck. Jamie Lee Curtis returns in the role of Laurie Strode and isn't given a lot of dialogue to work with but does her best to deliver legitimate bursts of fear and anxiety as she crawls and stumbles around the hospital hiding from Michael Myers. Lance Guest (""The Last Starfighter"") plays paramedic Jimmy who is convincingly intent on keeping Laurie safe from Myers' clutches. Donald Pleasance returns as Dr. Loomis and continues to add a level of class and drama to the film that many slasher movies of the decade sorely lacked. http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",Halloween II
131,acidburn-10,Great follow up,8,17 June 2005,"Well Halloween 2 picks up where the first one leaves off, Michael Myers is still on the loose and Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to hospital, meanwhile Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is frantically looking for Myers with the police in tow. Michael kills a few townspeople and all hell breaks loose when he reaches the hospital and starts killing off all the doctors and nurses and finsh what he started to try and kill Laurie, will Dr Loomis get to him in time or will it be too late.Well to start off ""Halloween 2"" is a great follow up and I'm so sick and tired of snobby nosed critics slagging it off. Halloween 2 is a worthy follow up, it still creates the tension of the first one maybe not on the same level but it's still a good film. The best part is when Michael reaches the hospital and starts killing everyone and the scene where Michael kills the nurse in front of Laurie is intense and plus the big chase scene towards the end with Michael and Laurie is really nerve racking and well done.Donald Pleasence (Loomis) is great as always he really shows the more manic side to his character and gives a passionate, riveting performance. Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie) giving in my opinion an even greater performance than in part one although she does make one or two mistakes but what final girl doesn't, Jamie Lee Curtis is definitely the best final girl ever. Nancy Stephens (Marion) doesn't have much to do but get into Loomis's way but she does an OK job. Lance Guest (Jimmy) does a good job whose sweet and lovable. Dick Warlock (The Shape) is the scariest looking Michael in the whole series.All in all Halloween 2 may not be as great as the first one but it's still brilliant and also does what every other horror movie sequel does more violence and a bigger body count, and it's definitely much better than most of the other Halloween sequels.",Halloween II
132,Darkside-Reviewer,"""You don't know what death is!""",6,30 July 2020,"Halloween 2 is the first sequel in the Halloween franchise and was released into theatre's in (1981) three years after the first Halloween (1978) movie became such a big hit with audiences and critics. John Carpenter originally had no plans for a sequel but because Halloween was such a massive success at the box office making almost $70 million dollars (US) against a $325,000 dollar (US) budget Universal Studios wanted a sequel to made. John Carpenter originally wanted no part in making Halloween 2 stating that he was happy with how the movie had ended and that the story had been fully told. Carpenter then learned that a sequel would be made with or without his involvement so he decided to write and produce the movie instead of directing it. During an interview in (1984) Carpenter labeled Halloween 2 as an ""Abomination"".Halloween 2 is certainly one of the better sequels in the franchise mainly due to the fact that the movie was written and produced by John Carpenter aswell as having both (Donald Pleasence) and (Jamie Lee Curtis) reprise their iconic roles from the first movie.Halloween 2 is a direct sequel to first movie taking place on the same night picking up where the first movie left off with Michael Myers falling from the balcony after being shot several times by Loomis with Loomis then discovering Michael's body has gone leading to Laurie being taken to the hospital while Loomis hunts down Michael with the sheriff yet again.The original tag line for the movie is ""More of the night he came home"" and that's exactly what you get with Halloween 2 only this time there are more scenes of Michael Myers creeping around in the shadows of people's back yards aswell as him killing off a few side characters until he finally tracks down Laurie and they continue their long game of cat and mouse.(Donald Pleasence) as Loomis is still the best part of any Halloween movie his intense speeches about his past experiences with Michael Myers and the hollow person who lives behind the mask are what make Michael Myers so frightening his character never speaks or has any emotion hence his nickname ""the shape"" but when Loomis talks about Michael we begin to understand that Michael Myers isn't human he's the devil in a mask pure evil contained inside a hollow human shell.",Halloween II
133,virek213,Unfortunate let-down due to unnecessary blood and gore,5,11 July 2001,"Like THE RAGE: CARRIE 2, HALLOWEEN II is filed in my book under ""Curiously Frustrating Films.""  This sequel to the 1978 horror/suspense classic HALLOWEEN picks up almost at the very instant where the original left off, with Donald Pleasance's character having emptied his gun into Michael Myers, only to see the maniac walk away.  Jamie Lee Curtis, who was wounded, is now being treated at Haddonfield Memorial Hospital...which is unfortunately exactly where Michael is going.  Why he is stalking Curtis exactly is what gets revealed here in this film.Director Rick Rosenthal accurately follows the pattern of John Carpenter's original film for the most part, buoyed by the return of Carpenter's own eerie score (enhanced by Alan Howarth) and the excellent cinematography of Dean Cundey, who did the original and later would do JURASSIC PARK and APOLLO 13.  On this count alone, HALLOWEEN II, like its predecessor, would normally rate a 10.But reportedly in post-production, concerned that this approach was now too old-fashioned in light of all the HALLOWEEN-inspired imitations like FRIDAY THE 13TH, Carpenter, behind Rosenthal's back, went and shot some graphically gory murder inserts--many of them, not surprisingly, involved the surgical implements inside the hospital that get used by Michael.  While many gore-hounds found these murders to be very creative, I personally thought of them as unnecessary and far too explicit.  Add to that some idiot plotting involving at least three members of the hospital staff (Leo Rossi, Pamela Susan Shoop, Gloria Gifford), and the result is something that really isn't much better than HALLOWEEN's many imitators.The film's big highlight is Curtis' being chased through the hospital by the killer, which pays perhaps an unintentional homage to the similar final sequence in Michael Crichton's 1973 sci-fi movie WESTWORLD.  Otherwise, HALLOWEEN II simply doesn't make it as a movie.  For me, this defines why it is a curiously frustrating film: It could have been so much more, but instead chose to be so much less.",Halloween II

Basically, Halloween, the movie, is split into two parts. It's just one big movie that has been split into two parts, really. Towards the end of Halloween, you could tell it results in a cliffhanger of some sorts, but Halloween II is able to explain that; in other words, the story continues, with the setting now taking place within a hospital, and it basically gets better from here. Halloween II in my eyes, was a really good movie. Unfortunately, however, it doesn't get the recognition it deserves for some strange reason, and is most certainly overlooked. Maybe because it's not a completely new story - away from the original one that is since it basically continues on from the original itself. Halloween II is an underrated gem. It finish's what the original one began. I think in this Halloween, it had more going compared with the first. What I liked about this one is the setting this movie takes place under: it takes place inside a hospital. This is where most of the drama unfolded. This takes place on the same night as Halloween.

Other than that it is a pretty enjoyable one and a half hours.3/5.",Halloween II
138,raypdaley182,worse than you'd think,3,26 September 2007,"Following straight on from where the original finished is where Halloween 2 starts off, Laurie Strode injured, Micheal Myers (I'll be calling him MM from now on) escaped even though he was badly injured and Dr Loomis still in pursuit.In case you'd forgotten the ending of Halloween there is a brief reprise here from when Laurie sends the 2 kids to call the police onwards. MM should have been caught as he was watching Loomis talk to the cop, there were a load of children walking down the alley and in the amount of time he was watching Loomis they would have reached where he was standing. I've debunked the film in the opening 10 minutes.The 2nd pretty HUGE goof is the guy they've got playing ""The Shape"" AKA MM, he is no-where near as big as the guy in the previous movie, he's too short and way too slim built to be Myers. If he's going to be lifting anyone up and throwing them around like the original it won't be believable at all.The story of the murders and the killers escape makes the TV & Radio news FAR TOO QUICKLY! This type of story back then would have taken days to be released, for fear of causing a local panic. The fake scare with the cat was very predictable (outside the hospital). It is amazing that none of the mob outside the Myers house tried to burn the place down (you'd think at least 1 person would try!).Now we only find out Laurie & Micheal are related in Laurie's dream sequence so that could have been a whole red herring. It's also obvious that both the nurse and orderly are going to die as they've had sex.Would anyone like to explain how Laurie went from unconscious and catatonic to escaping down a corridor in mere minutes? And MM would NOT be able to lift that nurse up on a tiny scalpel the way he does, the blade or handle would snap!Loomis put 5 rounds into Myers in the foyer (so he's now been shot 11 times), I assume the empty 9mm he points at MM before he gets stabbed was a gun he took off the Marshal in the car. Laurie manages to fire 2 shots from a revolver that only had 1 round left in it hitting MM in both eyes (a shot that even a marksman would struggle to make at close range in the dark and she was firing with a bad shoulder!).Our final look at Myers sees him face down on fire (having somehow survived a gas explosion but he was already blind anyway) and almost certainly dead and Laurie Strode being taken to an unknown destination.Weak ending and awful sequel, especially the idea of Laurie being MM's sister.",Halloween II
139,DogePelis2015,Halloween II,7,7 November 2021,"It's a decent sequel, although it falls short when compared to its predecessor; the plot is passable and violent enough to be a very tense experience, it is recommended.",Halloween II
140,doctorsmoothlove,The wrong direction,3,5 November 2009,"Sorry I didn't publish this review on Halloween as I intended. If you remember the post I made many months ago, I promised to review many older horror films and their contemporary versions. I always planned to include Halloween II as part of this series. This entry would have appeared anyway, but the psychological aspect of posting on October 31 would have been worthwhile. Oh well, I'll also review Halloween III: Season of the Witch since a sequel to the new film will be released next year.In the surprisingly long three years between Halloween and its sequel, the horror film market underwent a drastic change. The last remnants of literature-based horror films gave way to crazy people with weapons films. People rediscovered Black Christmas and ate up Halloween. The expected sequel to the original film is a genre film in this tradition. Is it a worthy follow-up? No, it isn't.The story takes place directly after the first film. Michael Myers survives six shots at point-blank range and has to find more young people to kill. His eternal and hitherto inexplicable nemesis, Laurie Strode, has been taken to Haddonfield Hospital to recover from her wounds. Michael goes there and kills nearly everyone until Dr. Loomis realizes where he is and kills him and himself in a fiery explosion.Everyone in Haddonfield who isn't Laurie Strode is a complete idiot. It takes them nearly the entire movie to determine where Myers could be. They even conduct a thorough investigation of Haddonfield sans hospital before they figure it out. The hospital staff is even worse. If you're someone involved in the medical field, don't watch this film. It equally insults everyone in your community. Doctors have nothing better to do than flirt with horny nurses who ignore infants to bathe with their suitors. Teenagers at least have the excuse of youth when they act stupid but not medical staff.By the way, since when have hospitals been so poorly lighted and serving so few patients? Rick Rosenthal attempts to recreate the sensation of Michael walking in Laurie's house from the first film without considering context. An empty house at night is much more frightening than an empty hospital at night. I'm aware that these films aren't intended to be fully realistic, but Halloween II is so stylized that I couldn't avoid feeling like I was watching a cartoon. The production feels more like a parody of the original than an actual continuation of story. In the first film, Michael Myers was a presence, something that wouldn't go away, like the monster under your bed. Laurie was the heroine. In Halloween II he is transformed into a protagonist who we have no reason to like. He's just there.The movie isn't scary either. Instead of suspenseful chases, Michael Myers disposes of victims violently and shows us lots of blood. Rick Rosenthal claims that it was John Carpenter's idea to add gore. Wikipedia has a link to a quote Carpenter made claiming ""it wasn't scary enough."" Shame on you John Carpenter for not believing in the technique you used in the first film. Indeed, there are moments when Halloween II actually works like its predecessor. How nice it would be to see the film as Rosenthal intended. Maybe he will finally release his preferred version of the film sometime in 2010.Many people say critics didn't originally understand that slasher ""antagonists"" like Myers are actually the main characters. The whole first person perspective seems to support this idea. It's especially true in this entry. We see too much from Myers' view. Laurie, therefore, loses her hardiness and becomes a generic victim who should die but doesn't. How does she elude the Shape? Not like she does in the first film by actively refusing to die but by dumb luck. Only Dr. Loomis is able to maintain his composure as a complete character. These types of movies really are sexist, but not just in how they portray women. For their intended male audience, they subtly support male domination over women. The man could be a husband or a killer in a mask. If this is one of the better sequels to the classic, I'm going to have many bad horror movie filled Friday nights.",Halloween II
141,Rickting,Could have been a lot worse,6,16 November 2014,"Halloween was a terrifying, chilling, nightmarish slasher flick which showed what horror should be and remains the only horror film to have me holding my breath for ages. Michael Myers is back and the night of hell isn't over yet. Sam Loomis tries to save Laurie Strode, who's stuck in a hospital. Despite having been shot 6 times, Michael Myers has survived and is heading for the hospital. Cue loads of ludicrous slasher mayhem and sequences of Jamie Lee Curtis screaming. At least she screams with emotion, attitude and believability unlike most horror movie characters. Halloween II gets a lot of flak from critics, but it's really not that bad at all. It's far from a great movie though. While the first was suspenseful and chilling, this succumbs to the clichés that the original's inferior imitators would follow and it retreads the original in a by the numbers fashion with plenty of rather dull gore. It's pretty silly as well. For example, the hospital in which Laurie Strode is in contains only her, a few babies and some irresponsible doctors.It's not as scary as the original, but it is still a little scary. Also, it is more fast paced than the first and there are plenty of entertaining and suspenseful chase sequences. It's not as well directed as its predecessor but the direction is good enough. Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis are excellent, and Michael Myers still makes a captain Kirk mask painted white scary. H2 remains watchable and enjoyable throughout and while it doesn't cover new ground it's still fun to watch and reasonably scary. The negative reviews really don't make a lot of sense. Michael Myers is a very effective villain. He's the personification of evil and although his repeated resurrections become tiresome he feels like a real threat and an unstoppable force of evil. Sam Loomis is a great character who is both enigmatic and compelling. Sadly, Donald Pleasance doesn't appear as much as he should cut he makes an impact. An underrated horror sequel overall, although some may have something to say about the film's disrespectful portrayal of hospital staff.6/10",Halloween II
142,Nightman85,"""Harold, ya want mayonnaise on your sandwich?""",6,23 December 2005,"The first, and one of the better, sequels to Carpenter's great Halloween (1978).Set on the same evening that the original film ended, murderous Michael Myers follows victim Laurie to the hospital.Halloween II is a big come down from Carpenter's original thriller, this sequel basically just falls into the slasher film mold big time. There's lots of murders and lots of blood to go with them. But still, this is one of the better sequels (in fact the best sequel until Halloween H20 in 1998) as Pleasence and Curtis thankfully return as their original characters. It also sports some occasional good suspense, an effectively creepy hospital setting, and a nicely done electronic version of Carpenter's Halloween theme.Bottom line it's an entertaining, though unspectacular follow-up. Definitely better than the four sequels that followed.** 1/2 out of ****",Halloween II

Now the doctor is on the hunt looking for Myers before continuing his rampage of killing off innocent teens. Michael manages to find Laurie in a hospital where many staff members are encountering the psychopath leaving only few survivors to help Laurie before it's too late.The film shares the same energy, if not by the same director. Rick Rosenthal, who would later direct more films from the same franchise manages to keep the thrills but by adding more blood and gore this time around.9/10",Halloween II

The killer is still out there, Donald Pleasance is on his tail, the night is far from over, and the chase continues. That sounds promising, right? Unfortunately, the writers of the script had no idea what to do. The first film was successful because it was an interesting story. But this time around, the writers had no story, and they decided to give us a repetition of some of the scares from the original film, hoping that alone would be a satisfying experience for the audience. How lazy and deluded.The only way to make this an interesting film was to introduce new elements into the story, to develop characters, and to come up with some interesting twists. A series of murders is simply not worthy of a film. Unfortunately that's all we got. Halloween II is really just a bad B movie, and it never even aspired to be anything more than that. Inexcusable.",Halloween II
148,jhaggardjr,Good first sequel,7,6 June 2000,"""Halloween II"" is a pretty good first sequel to John Carpenter's brilliant 1978 shocker. Of course it's not as good as the first movie, but it's much better than the next four films in the series. And it has Jamie Lee Curtis, reprising her role here as Laurie Strode. However the same can't be said for Donald Pleasence, who's Dr. Sam Loomis started overacting here (his character would eventually get worse with each passing ""Halloween"" movie, and after the way he acted in part 5 it seemed like Dr. Loomis needed to spend some time in the insane asylum). Still, the cinematography and film score (done once again by Dean Cundey and John Carpenter, respectably) are effective like in the first film. Carpenter returned to write and produce ""Halloween II"" with his then partner Debra Hill, but he opted not to direct the film. That aspect hurts a little. Also, this movie is more violent than the first film. Still, ""Halloween II"" is a ""Halloween"" movie that should not be forgotten. And there would not be a good ""Halloween"" movie made until ""Halloween H20"" came out 20 years after the original.*** (out of four)",Halloween II

And now, there's a whole other string of events that transpired on The Night He Came Home that have yet to be displayed on film.There had to be a lot of pressure when it came to following up this film but, for the most part, the team behind the film did a pretty good job.
Jamie Lee Curtis returns for the second time as Laurie Strode, picking up from the very second the first film ended with her being loaded into an ambulance and taken away. As with the first one, Curtis is really the absolute star and finest aspect of the film overall.
This is a slow-burn film that can be a bit tedious to watch, particularly in the first half. In fact, one could go so far as to say it's boring. And it certainly doesn't need to exist; the first film didn't leave the audience with burning questions about anything else potentially happening that very night.
Yet, with perhaps one of my personal favorite horror movie kills of all time and a final act that is easily better than anything the first film had to offer, I can't help but be pleased that Halloween II exists. It's definitely the kind of film that's exciting to watch once, but is also well worth revisiting in the future.",Halloween II

152,domino1003,Later That Night....,9,24 August 2005,"""Halloween II"" is the first of many sequels (With the exception of ""Halloween III: Season of The Witch"") with the seemingly indestructible Michael Myers. Taking up where we last left off, Michael Myers escapes after being shot several times by Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence). A wounded Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis)is taken to the local hospital to recover. Laurie is pretty much hysterical at this point, not feeling safe in the confines of the hospital. And she's right: Michael manages to find out her whereabouts and starts a killing spree in the hospital until Laurie is again running for her life from Michael. We soon find out from Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens), the nurse from the first film, that Laurie is Michael Myers sister! With time running out, Dr. Loomis races to the hospital in order to stop Michael from killing his own sister.Even though John Carpenter didn't direct this film (The honors would go to Rick Rosenthal, who would also direct ""Halloween: Resurrection""), his famous theme still remains. There are several flaws in this film that still nag me to this day (Why are there so many empty rooms in the hospital? Why didn't the nurse that was in contact with the security guard worry when he didn't get back in touch with her?). It's not as good as the original, but it comes close.",Halloween II

They have the burned body's teeth checked, still convinced that Micheal is alive he goes with the Officer to the Myers where people are rioting outside the house, Sam and the Officer then discover that the guy wan't Micheal Myers but some Teenager meanwhile Micheal has sneaked his way into the hospital and killing people in his way as he searches for Laurie Strode.Halloween II is a great sequel that's just has creepy and suspenseful as the first Halloween.

I always thought it was cool that this picks up right at the end of the first one. Very good idea. This film isn't bad. In fact, it has quite a few good scares and some funny moments also. The acting is good and many of the original actors from the 1st film are here. However, despite good atmosphere some of the scenes are very stark and fall sort of flat. I see similarities in the way the scenes are shot compared to the first film and had this been the first it may have worked better but here it seems a little too low key and dry. A bit too simple. Halloween fans should like this but it seems that many are impatient with this for reasons I've mentioned. One thing really stands out viewing this film now; how could there have ever been any sequels after this? Loomis and Michael die in this film. It is such a shock to know that the sequels continued after this. I guess nothing can stop Michael Meyers. Maybe the whole thing was just a dream!",Halloween II

This movie takes place later that Halloween night in which the first movie occurs. This movie is like the aftermath of the events of the first. Everyone knows about the murders and Laurie's injuries, and they know there's a killer on the loose. Michael is actually shown as well, on his trail of destruction and murder. Laurie is at the Hospital with a variety of interesting doctors, nurses and paramedics. Particularly Jimmy Lloyd, the paramedic who almost falls for Laurie. I think he should have had more camera time but I can't complain, it might distract us from the story. Over all this was more interesting than the original. I give this an 8/10.

Laurie Strode has been rushed to the hospital and Michael Meyers is still on the loose. As he slaughters his way through the formerly peaceful suburb, making his unerring way towards the hospital where Laurie has been taken, both the traumatized Laurie and the determined Dr. Loomis learn the truth at last: Laurie is Michael's little sister, born two years after Judith's murder and adopted by the Strode's. Michael has already killed one sister and is determined to murder the other before the night is over.This sequel to the 1977 classic Halloween isn't too shabby. It's a little more exploitative than the first. The murders are gorier and the blood is brighter and more generously splashed around. The victims are far more vacuous in this installment and we're given no time at all to see them develop or to care about them before they are stabbed, desanguinated or boiled to death. However, I do like the way in which all of the loose threads are tied up in this one and the tidy explanation is pretty believable. This is a straightforward, unapologetic slasher film which still manages to be a hell of a lot better than many of its modern day contemporaries.",Halloween II
158,skybrick736,Halloween II: The Nightmare Isn't Over,8,31 October 2011,Picking up right after the first one started we are now seeing the transition of Dr. Loomis becoming the main protagonist over Laurie which is the same in later movies. Donald Pleasance is as great as always but I believe Halloween 2 was his best performance of any movies in the Halloween franchise. The plot is good and well paced and the new characters are watchable and interesting. It lacks some flow in the film in the beginning but the film eventually turns itself around becoming an intense slasher film. In a perfect world this may have should of been the last Michael Myers film because of the spectacular ending but we are left with many more Myers films.,Halloween II
159,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,6,22 March 2005,"After the smash of Halloween it seemed inevitable that there would be a sequel. Carpenter's films have a habit of ending with a cliffhanger, and fans wanted to see whether Michael would return. He does, just as Laurie is taken to a nearby hospital. Loomis is still on the prowl, and Michael follows Laurie to hospital intent on finishing his work, killing any unfortunate doctors, nurses or patients who get in his way. Once again Laurie and Michael are alone to chase and fight to the death.Unfortunately, this for the most part seems like a cash in, and is a much inferior sequel complete with weaker performances and more elaborate deaths. There are good points though, Curtis and Pleasance are still great, while the setting is quite atmospheric. Many of the original cast come back for a short while, keeping us interested with the plot, and there are plenty of deaths. However, much of the film does lack the tension which Carpenter can easily create, and we do not care about any of the new characters. Michael now seems to be unstoppable which further distances us from the reality of the first film. This is OK, and definitely worth watching if you're a fan of the first.6.5 out of 10",Halloween II
160,mwilson1976,More from the night He came home!!,5,26 November 2019,"Michael Myers continues his relentless pursuit of teenager Laurie Strode in this direct sequel to John Carpenters 1978 hit. It is the directorial debut of Rick Rosenthal and sees Carpenter producing alongside Debra Hill, although he did compose and perform the score alongside Alan Howarth, which is a reworking of his compositions for the first movie, particularly the main theme's familiar piano melody. The action in this one switches to a hospital where Laurie is being treated following her ordeal from the original movie, Myers massacres his way through the cast while Donald Pleasance reprising his role as Doctor Loomis closes in to try and stop him. This movie features a higher body count, and more gore and nudity, including a syringe through an eyeball, but is a lot poorer for it. These scenes were supposedly added by Carpenter in post production against the will of Rosenthal, as it was deemed that the movie was initially too tame for a slasher audience. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rightly described it as ""a fall from greatness"" that ""doesn't even attempt to do justice to the original."" It just tries to outdo all the other Halloween rip-offs that followed and just becomes one itself. In 1982, Richard Delmer Boyer of El Monte, California, murdered Francis and Eileen Harbitz, an elderly couple in Fullerton, California, and blamed his actions on Halloween II.",Halloween II
161,theshadow908,Lives up to the original.,8,16 May 2006,"Halloween II makes a genius move created by the original film's writers John Carpenter and Debra Hill, and takes place on the exact same night as the first film, even though this sequel was made 3 years later. In Halloween II, Michael has escaped again, and Laurie is rushed to the hospital where Michael chases her down, leaving bloody bodies in his path. The climax of the film happens when Dr. Sam Loomis discovers the startling connection between Michael and Laurie. Rick Rosenthal takes over the director's chair for this sequel, but don't worry...John Carpenter stayed on board as writer/producer/composer, so the feel of the original film is somewhat there, but there is a change.Halloween II is just as entertaining as the first film, but the feel is kind of different because Halloween II is far more of a slasher film than the first one. All of the mystery of Michael Myers is gone. He's not a shape in the shadows anymore. Every time we see him, he's in full view. Where the first film had only five murders, one of which was off camera, that weren't really that gory, this movie has more murders that are really gruesome.The acting in this movie is just as good as the first one, even though Jamie Lee Curtis's role isn't as large. The film sort of revolves around her, but we don't see her a whole lot. This movie is more to unfold the mystery of Michael Myers instead of just to have him stalking people. Halloween II is a definite must see for anyone who liked the original because it's a direct continuation. This is the first Halloween that turned it into a slasher series, and I have to say it would have been much better if the series ended here.8/10",Halloween II

Haddonfield, IL is a pretty boring town, and the introduction of a serial killer doesn't much change that.My fellow horror fans might stone me for that kind of blasphemy. But one of my deep, dark secrets is that I'm often underwhelmed by classic horror films. This film picks up at the same moment of the same night as the original ""Halloween"" (1978) – which was itself, upon revisiting, thinly plotted and quite slow. Why not make them the same movie?I'd give this film a 2 out of 10 for a creepy premise and one scary sequence involving a hot tub. I think that's probably generous.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",Halloween II
163,bh_tafe3,A different type of film to the first,5,6 December 2008,"You'd probably think from the get go that I wasn't a huge fan of Halloween II, but I actually enjoyed it.This is a very different film to the first one with very different goals. The main purpose in the first one was to use a claustrophobic atmosphere to create a terrifying monster. In the second film, they are using that terrifying monster to kill a bunch of people in creative ways, and given the goal, Halloween II is a smashing success.We take up right where the first film left off with Micheal surviving the gun shot from Loomis and getting up to terrorise the Haddonfeild neighbourhood. Quickly dispatching a rather silly young woman before she can finish her brownies! Micheal continues his quest to find his sister Laurie Strode, who has been taken to a local hospital.Going to a local hospital gives Micheal the opportunity to boil a girl to death in a bath tub, slice up a security guard, bleed a girl dry and eventually blow himself up after getting his eyes shot out.Dr Loomis is a more fun character in this movie, acting with a lot more confidence rather than the tortured old man he is in later sequels, or the dead serious character he played in the first film. After adding some depth to the Laurie Strode character in the first one and creating a character who was more than a typical damsel in distress, in this one they decide to undo all of that good work and make Laurie Strode exactly like a typical damsel in distress.This film lacks the atmosphere of the original, but keeps the same effective score. It's a nice little movie, containing some nudity and lots of blood in a couple of scenes, but no real extreme violence. An enjoyable return trip to Haddonfeild.",Halloween II
164,squeezebox,"Inferior, mean-spirited, artless *possible spoilers*",4,24 January 2003,"HALLOWEEN II picks up at the conclusion of the first movie. After believing he has dispatched The Shape (Dick Warlock) with six shots from his gun, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) soon discovers that he has gotten up and walked off into the night. The Shape has, in fact, pursued Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), the only survivor of the evening's earlier rampage, to the world's most understaffed and poorly lit hospital, while the obsessive Dr. Loomis rants and raves about finding his former patient. This nasty, mean-spirited and needlessly violent sequel lacks virtually all the merit of the original, replacing style and atmosphere with excessive gore and sadism that would make Jason Voorhees cringe. Curtis's role is reduced to a whimpering idiot and Pleasance's scenery-chewing is unintentionally hilarious. A few good moments are drowned out by such gratuitous scenes of cruelty as a kid with a razor blade stuck in his mouth, a woman's face being burned off in boiling water and an innocent teen getting hit by a police car. It's obvious the writer-producer team of John Carpenter and Debra Hill knew they couldn't recapture the chilling terror of the original and decided to concentrate on gory set-pieces to compete with other slasher fare such as Friday THE 13TH and MY BLOOD VALENTINE.The biggest problem with HALLOWEEN II, however, is giving Michael Meyers a back story involving Laurie being his sister. This makes the character far less mysterious and therefore less scary. Also, the deep blackness of the Shape mask's eyeholes is now replaced with a pair of demented-looking eyes staring out (one of which has miraculously healed from being poked out with a hanger). This further changes The Shape from ""The Boogeyman"" into an all-too non-supernatural psycho.And can anyone tell me what ""Mr. Sandman"" has to do with anything?",Halloween II
165,akshatmahajan,Disappointing,5,9 October 2020,"Halloween II was a disappointment. The story, and suspense which made first part masterpiece was missing in this part.The setting was a bad idea, a hospital which is almost empty. The suspense of this movie was not even scary. At one time I was thinking that why producers greenlit this type of senseless story.Overall, you may enjoy it little bit but at the end it will be disappointment.",Halloween II

167,flicklover,"Just ok, not close to the original.",7,25 May 2020,"Halloween 2 is a good, but not great sequel to the classic original directed by John Carpenter. That film was a masterpiece of suspense and terror. It spawned so many imitators that the slasher film became a parody of itself. This film is better than most of the Halloween imitators, but it does fall into the imitator category. Halloween was more about the scares, this sequel is more about showing Michael kill in more gory ways.The story is set the same night as the first film. Laurie is taken to the hospital and Michael is alive, our and about looking for her. Donald Pleasence is back as Loomis, looking for Michael. The film drags along, it is not even close to being as tense and suspenseful as the first bit it does try. Of course a sequel is going to have more budget after the success of the original. The film is well shot, but it focuses more on gore and less on tension. I believe that the filmmakers felt pressure to show more gore because of all of the films of it's kind were doing that at the time. And when Michael arrives at the hospital where Laurie is he starts picking of the nurses left and right. Again, each killing is more elaborate this time. When he finally gets to Laurie the movie gets really good, unfortunately, that is only on the last 20 minutes. But again, we root for her. Oh, and we also discover that she is Michael's sister!!! It all comes to a head between Michael, Loomis and Laurie in an ending that should have been the end to the Michael Myers story. But we know it wasn't.Good, but not great sequel.Grade: B-",Halloween II
168,monstermayhem32,A nice continuation of Mitchael's return,7,24 October 2014,"Picking up where the 78 film left off, Michael is on the loose in hadron field as his psychiatrist Sam loomis attempts to grind his patient. Meanwhile Laurie strode who suffered emotional trauma and done injuries at Mitchael's hands is sent to haddonfield memorial hospital where she is treated for her wounds. However Michael manages to track down Laurie at the hospital and slaughters the hospital staff in attempt to get closer to her. The film reveals the connection between Michael and Laurie and why he wants her. While I do feel that Jamie lee Curtis was underused in the film but given the material she had to work with, she does a decent job playing the heroine frightened and scared. Donald pleasance is wonderful as Sam loomis playing off as the unlikely hero who knows Michael is evil and will stop at nothing to achievenhis goal, overall a great continuation.",Halloween II

172,I_Am_The_Taylrus,Good Slasher Sequel,8,2 October 2006,"SPOILERSHalloween 2 is a very good slasher sequel. It isn't nearly as good as the original Halloween, but it is good. There is way more blood and brutal deaths. Such as: 1: A nurse gets scalded to death.2: A man gets his throat slit by a scalpel.3: A nurse's blood is drained out of her.And much more! Like I said before, this movie is much more brutal, bloody, and gory, but I guess most sequels are like that. As you should know by now, this takes place in a hospital right after the events of the first Halloween, about an hour after Michael disappears. It is a good slasher film and should be viewed by all fans of the Halloween series.8/10Recommended films: Halloween, Scream, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween H20, and Halloween 4",Halloween II

174,TheRedDeath30,One of the Best Horror Sequels,8,30 October 2014,"What is the greatest sequel in the history of horror? If you wanna kick it old school, most would say BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. In recent years, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS could hold a fight for that title. I would easily put this movie up for submission in that debate. In my head, there is a list of the 200 or so greatest horror movies of all time. While very few would be sequels, this would make that list.If you are going to start your assessment of this movie by comparing it to the original, then naturally it's not going to hold up as much. Carpenter's masterpiece is one of the greatest horror films of the modern era. Few thrillers or horror films have ever been able to match the sense of tension and suspense that was created by the original movie. Carpenter, essentially, created the mold that would be used for every slasher film to follow and it was not going to be an easy film to follow.There are many reasons that Carpenter is considered to be a master of horror and Rick Rosenthal was pretty much never heard of again. Most of the suspense that made the first so great is gone in this sequel. However, just as the original set the blueprint for what slasher films would follow, this helped set the blueprint for what a slasher sequel would follow. It has replaced the artistic touch by going over-the- top in its' approach. There is more death and more gore. The dramatic approach to making him an evil entity is taken to the extreme of making him a superhuman unstoppable force.The end result is a movie that still stands as one of the best slashers of the 80s. In later sequels, Michael may have become a mockery of himself, but he's in full terrifying presence here. As he stalks a wounded Laurie through a darkened hospital that is a claustrophobic feel that heightens the sense that there is no escape from this evil. The kills are creative without getting ludicrous. This is a genuinely scary movie. Special nod to the razor blade in the gums scene with the little kid which was the scene that scared me the most as a lil one, having grown up in the late 70s/ early 80s in the height of trick r treat hysteria, I became convinced this would happen to me one day.There are, also, some odd things in this movie which lower the rating a bit. Why doesn't Loomis recognize his associate from the loony bin? Why is Laurie the only patient in this entire hospital except for a few babies? How did a psycho like Michael, who was imprisoned at a young age, learn a word like ""Samhain"" and what does it have to do with wanting to kill his sister? Then again, as a tried and true horror film, I just sort of roll with things like this and forgive them as the little eccentricities of the genre.I would put this above any sequel from the Friday, Elm Street or Chainsaw series.",Halloween II
175,illbebackreviews,"""You Can't Kill the Boogeyman!""",9,5 November 2012,"I've seen the original Halloween a few times and I've seen this one just once before. This review is based on my thoughts after watching the film for the second time. Let me say, this film to be, is better than the original which I thought was hard to come by. Why do I like this one more?Well, unlike the original from the opening scene you know Laurie's in danger as well as Sam Loomis. This film illustrated it perfectly, with more killing and much more horror than the original. As usual, the score is just scary to say the least and fits in perfectly to the movie. This film was perfectly able to illustrate that it was much darker and in this movie, you can immediately start to feel sorry for Laurie as you understand she's in danger.***SPOILERS***I particularly liked the opening scene before just before the title appeared. I liked how it showed the flashback and how it showed Michael had disappeared. When Dr Loomis says the line ""You don't know what death is"" and then the music just builds up! That was the moment when I knew this film would be something remarkable! The scene where Loomis goes inside the hospital as Laurie pleads for help was great. When she started running and screaming to open the door, that scene really felt intense as Michael just slowly walks up. From that point on, the rest of the film was just intense and beautifully done, making Halloween II as good, if not better, than the original film!",Halloween II
176,Toronto85,Halloween II,9,28 June 2013,"Michael Myers picks up right where he left off as Halloween night continues in 'Halloween II'. It literally picks up where the 1978 classic finished, Dr. Loomis looks outside to see that Michael (who had just been shot six times) has survived his wounds and has run off from the scene of the crime. Laurie Strode who just went through the attack from Michael is meanwhile taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital. After dispatching a random girl, Michael takes off towards the hospital in order to finish what he started and kill Laurie! He'll first have to get through a handful of nurses as well as a determined Dr. Loomis in order to accomplish his mission.I LOVE this sequel to 'Halloween' (1978), a film in which I gave a perfect score to. The setting first of all is a great one for a slasher flick. The hospital is dark and creepy and filled with doctors and nurses who were clearly thrown in to add to the body count. The musical score is just as effective, and Michael Myers is just as deranged as he was in the first film. The acting all around was pretty good, particularly from the nurses. Pamela Susan Shoop, Tawny Moyer, Ana Alicia and Gloria Gifford do a very good job as the unaware hospital staff. There is a great atmospheric feeling to 'Halloween II', you never know where Michael is going to pop out of in the dark corridors of the hospital. We also get some backstory to Michael and Laurie, of course being that they are brother and sister. It really ties everything together quite nicely and explains some questions people might have from the first one, like perhaps why was Michael after this girl? The one downside to 'Halloween II' was the lack of character development. It was done well in the original film, but not in this sequel. We meet the supporting characters, but they are clearly there just to be killed off.Jamie Lee Curtis does well as Laurie, but her character is given a back- seat in this one. She doesn't really do or say much until the final chase scene (which was also done well). Overall Halloween II is an EXCELLENT horror film that should be seen by all. It has some great scares, great kills, some tense moments and a wonderful main setting at that dark and deserted hospital. I also love that it continued right where the first one left off. Smart decision by the film-makers. 9/10",Halloween II
177,lorcan-61881,A sequel a few hairs off the first film!,10,1 February 2018,"Lately, I have been watching a lot of old classic horror films like Friday The 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre etc. so I have decided to continue reviewing the Halloween series after I have decided to rewatch them this year. Starting off with Halloween 2 (my review for Halloween is a few reviews down). Halloween 2 picks up straight after Halloween and follows Laurie who has now been sent to the hospital after her injuries from the first film and eventually Laurie realizes that Michael is back to kill her and the hospital orderly. Halloween 2 is an amazing sequel, it does everything so well and honestly feels like a true sequel and actually, really really similar to Halloween despite John Carpenter not returning. The film is different though in ways from the first film, it also had some of the best deaths in the entire series including the scene where Michael stuffs a womans face in boiling water, that death was so fun! Halloween 2 is an amazing sequel that deserves to be notcied for what it truely is.",Halloween II

180,Mr_Censored,"""You don't know what death is!""",7,21 October 2008,"Despite being made three years after the original, ""Halloween II"" picks up directly where ""Halloween"" left off, with Dr. Loomis looking on in both amazement and dread as Michael has escaped him once again. We follow Laurie Strode to the town hospital where she is treated for injuries sustained during Michael's attack and in a drug-induced haze, starts remembering disturbing parts of her childhood that were blocked out long ago. Naturally, Michael finds her there, and with the town police force slow to pick up on his plans, a dangerous game of cat and mouse ensues.For the most part, ""Halloween II"" is typical slasher fare. Although ""Halloween"" creators John Carpenter and Debra Hill still had a hand in it, the sequel is hardly in the same class as it's predecessor nor does it have half the suspense. Regardless, as far as sequels go, this one is still worth a go-round. Instead of just giving us more bloodshed for the sake of more bloodshed (and don't worry, there's more bloodshed), a back-story is created for both Michael Myers and his helpless victim, Laurie Strode. The film's director, Rick Rosenthal, does his best to match the tension and the grisliness of the first film, but sometimes it falls flat. There is one scene in particular where we follow a security guard into the basement of the hospital that goes on forever. I'm not exaggerating when I say time stops for this scene, and that's a perfect example of this film's main flaw. Rosenthal isn't Carpenter and it is obvious. ""Halloween II"" wants to be the companion piece to the original so bad that it tries to match it, but can't. To be honest, the movie is at it's best when it acts as a slasher sequel and works on the story being told. While being a bit convoluted, the revelation that is made in this film regarding Michael's connection to Laurie is an interesting one and sets the stage for a rather dramatic third act. There are other positives to this film as well. Take the main setting of the film, the hospital. Most of the film takes place there and it is utilized rather well, making way for some truly unsettling moments, such as Michael passing through a room full of newborn children. The make-up/effects are quite a prominent feature of this film, and although not the main focus, are just as good as anything else from it's time. Most of the actors who survived ""Halloween"" show up in the sequel, but it is Jamie Lee Curtis and the iconic Donald Pleasence who steal the show. Curtis, despite playing a character out of commission for the bulk of the film, conveys the sheer terror and confusion necessary for the situation. Pleasence is great as he always is, as Michael's doctor turned arch-nemesis. He would return for three more sequels and this was just the beginning of his mad doctor routine. If you can accept that the ""more, more"" attitude of horror sequels is in full effect here and that, other than in story, it bears little to no resemblance to the original's feel and tone, then all is fine. Despite some flaws, ""Halloween II"" is still a worthy sequel. At the very least, it keeps the story interesting, all while updating the style and effects for the 80's. Afterall, how good could a sequel to such an influential film be? This film falls in line with other #2's such as ""Jaws 2"" and ""Psycho II"" in that it is good, but has got nothing on it's source material.",Halloween II
181,dormesher-21565,Great sequel,8,6 October 2018,"Halloween 2 the first of many sequels in this great horror franchise and this is fantastic sequel Michael Myers once again shows why he is a fantastic horror icon with more Great kills.Taking place on the same night of the first film this film starts straight where the last one left off and it's great for it it follows on really well for the first and manages to keep the same spirit as the original but also adding new elements to the franchise which are really interesting.
This is the film that announced Michael Myers and Laurie Strode are brother and sister and Laurie was adopted by the Strode family after Michael killed his sister when he was younger and interesting idea to bring to the franchise and one I like alot. However there is negative with this because we never see Laurie find this out in the movie it's said in a line between Loomis and a women who works with him in the franchise I just wish we would of seen a scene with Laurie finding this out.Another negative is it they do kinda push Laurie aside in this movie with her being in hospital for most of the movie which is just annoying to me because she is such a great character and seeing her not doing anything for most of the movie is pretty annoying.
However once again Jamie Leigh Curtis is great and still a horror legend.Donald Pleasence is even better in this movie and his still hunting down Myers he will stop at nothing to stop such a horror legend and still my favourite character in the franchise.My favourite kill in the film is definitely the one with the nurse in the hot tub Michael just keeps dumbing her head in and in over again and her face looks all burnt great kill and a great moment in the franchise.
The third act of this movie is also incredible something that is a common thing in this franchise they are all good third actsVerdict 8.1/10 great sequel in the franchise just some little negatives like Laurie never finding out about her brother and her being pushed aside annoys me a little but everything else is great",Halloween II
182,Sober-Friend,Good Follow Up,10,9 July 2016,"This film was the first time I have ever seen a sequel that picks up right where the previous film left off. To me if you watch the original ""Halloween"" then you must watch ""Halloween II"". Now it is well known that John Carpenter was forced to make this film. He was being sued because he took his film projects of ""The Fog"" and ""Escape from New York"" to Avco Embassy after he had a verbal agreement to make the films with another studio. To settle the lawsuit John Carpenter came back as a co-writer and executive producer of the ""Halloween II"". Rick Rosenthal takes over the directors chair. After he turned in his cut of the film John Capenter re-shot some scenes and added a few more to make the film ""better"". The original cut according to John Carpenter was ""As scary as a Quincy Episode"". Now the film that we are all familiar with is a compromised version but in reality most films are. That doesn't mean ""Halloween II"" isn't good. The truth is the film does work and you really don't need to see the first one to enjoy this.In ""Halloween II"" the original babysitter is now trapped in the local hospital. The murders (from the 1st movie) have turned Haddonfield upside down! What was once a quite town is no longer. Michael is after all come home and on a murder rampage. After Laurie Strode (The Lone Survivor from Halloween) is admitted to the local hospital! we see that Dr Loomis is still on the hunt looking for Michael. He is now being accompanied by Deputy Hunt. At the hospital we meet the various staff members. What is unknown to them is that Michael is on his way to finish what he started. The final twist of the film is that we learn why he went after Laurie to begin with. Happy Halloween",Halloween II

Halloween II starts right where the original ends, which was a GREAT decision.

Not in the least bit scary and its ridiculous that Michael recovers from 12 bullets to the chest and being blown up and burned.",Halloween II
187,FKDZ,Enjoyable but unsatisfyingly slow sequel.,6,19 October 2020,"Halloween II keeps going right where the original left off, even with a recap at the beginning of the movie. To me that was fine but in general I am not a fan of recaps at all. After that one of the longest credit sequences comes up like wow.Then we get going, and right off the bat I'm really engaged by the directing in particular in this movie. It keeps a good flow and the shots are just great all around. A few favorites are the Michael emerging from the dark in the doctor's office and Michael's scene at the jacuzzi. But the movies gets very slow for me after the first random kill Michael commits. The characters are quite bland and they tried to play a bit with dialog but this movie has such a serious and depressing tone which also contributed to its slow feel.How this movie feels different though is that it's much more of a slasher like F13, and its goal is to get those kills and not build a ton of suspense or just terrify the audience. This movie definitely lacks some good scary Michael moments like the original.The standout good things about this movie are the directing and the music (ofcourse) and the last 30-ish minutes of the movie where things start going.This does lead me to the slow walking Michael trope, I guess since he is a ''unstoppable'' force it's and it's not like he needs to hurry. But it gets a bit old and overused in this. In addition to this the murder weapon he uses the most is some tiny scalpel.. he even manages to lift up a nurse with just that tiny thing. I don't know but that just annoyed me and in that example as well the nurse couldn't have died from such a small blade. In general I found it a bit comical to see him walking around menacingly with a tiny scalpel.Now the kills, the best ones are simply the two people in the jacuzzi, the whole scene is well done and tense. The security guard's death was the most underwhelming with a insane amount of screen time to build up tension. In general though its pretty lackluster and heavily censored.Now this movie also reveals that Laurie is Michael's sister. I think this is fine and it didn't surprise me that much and answered laurie's ''why'' question when she was laying in the hospital bed. Now the whole mythology thing in the classroom kind came outta nowhere for me. It's okay I guess but I hope we don't really see any of that ''backstory'' again.Now about the end, I think it was pretty good especially with the Doctor sacrificing himself (even though it was in vain). But the Doctor caused so many innocents to die already and was pretty reckless this movie. So I felt it was appropriate for him to be the hero for a second and a good goodbye to his character.So for me a 6/10, very enjoyable for a single viewing but slow and lackluster in suspense+kills.",Halloween II
188,Tikkin,A solid sequel,9,23 March 2006,"Halloween 2 seems to get mixed reactions but no one can deny that it stands alone as a great slasher film. Of course it's hard to take Halloween 2 as its ""own"" film compared to the greatness that is the original Halloween, but most should be able to overlook that and enjoy it for what it is. Halloween 2 uses the suspense of Halloween but adds more gore and a faster pace to the mix. I found it thoroughly entertaining, with some great death scenes and genuinely suspenseful moments (Jamie-Lee escaping through the ventilation grill). The only minor points spoiling Halloween 2 are that sometimes it gets a bit far-fetched. For example, Jamie-Lee is escaping through the ventilation grill and Michael Myers takes an eternity to simply walk over and pull her back down. There were also a few moments of very bad acting. Overall though it's thoroughly entertaining and I would recommend it to all horror fans. It doesn't ruin the integrity of the original film like most sequels do.",Halloween II
189,bayardhiler,Worthy Sequel to a Horror Classic,8,11 November 2017,"Sequels are, by nature, hard to do for one is essentially trying to recapture that magic that made the original so good. Very few actually succeed. However, every now and then, someone actually makes a sequel worth seeing. Case in point, 1981's ""Halloween II"". Though I can't say it's as good as the first, it does manage to retain some of the magic and suspense that made the original so good. The story picks up exactly where the first one left off: Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) shoots Michael Myers six times but as we all now doesn't die. From there, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to the local hospital but as we soon discover, Michael isn't done with her, and it's here that we discover the famous motive behind Michael's madness; Laurie Strode is Michael's sister. It's a fight for survival as Michael goes the hospital staff one by one until only Laurie is left, and is forced to face the horror of Michael once again.Written and produced by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, ""Halloween II"" was a film that wasn't supposed to be made, as Carpenter and Hill didn't believe that a sequel was necessary. But when money enters the picture, people have a funny way of changing their minds. In many cases, such a scenario is a recipe for disaster. I know that Carpenter himself has said he's not impressed with the script he wrote (going as far as to say the only thing that helped him through the writing of it was a six pack of Budwieser). But I don't think he should be so hard on himself, for unlike most sequels - especially horror ones - ""Halloween II"" works. Though Carpenter didn't direct it, the movie still has the Carpenter feel to it, as since many of the same crew of the original also worked on this one. The one who did direct, Rick Rosenthal (Before he directed the atrocious ""Halloween Resurrection"") manages to weave a very good, effective, atmospheric tale of a killer stalking a hospital in the dead of night, and deserves to be congratulated here. It also helps that Carpenter's original theme and score gets an 80's makeover, courtesy of electronic composer Alan Howarth (someone I've had the pleasure of meeting personally), which I must say, makes the Halloween theme that much more effective and creepy! But above all, another important quality is the acting. Everyone here does a fine job, from Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance to Leo Rossi and Lance Guest. Whenever a character dies, we feel for them. It's one of those instances where one feels a strong sense of camaraderie among the actors, something that is very rare in any movie. Some of criticized this as being slow, and I'll admit it does take longer for the film to get going. But the feeling of suspense is still there throughout the picture, and I myself consider this the best of the ""Halloween"" sequels, and look just as forward to it every time fall rolls around as I do the original. Happy Halloween!!!!",Halloween II
190,LanceBrave,"Did ""Halloween"" Ever Need to Be a Series?",6,5 November 2013,"""Halloween II"" is a slasher sequel held in high regard by the fandom that I've never been crazy about. The film never impressed and always played like a pale shadow of the original. I held ""Friday the 13th Part II"" in similar regard, which I sort-of reevaluated. So why not Michael Myers second outing? There's a certain verisimilitude to the premise that's admirable. ""Halloween II"" picks up right where the first ended, on Halloween night, 1978. The film occasionally dips its toes into realism. Laurie's traumatized state is treated logically. Haddonfield's reaction to the murders is interesting. News of the killings line every TV, photographers buzzing around the survivors. The town folks gathering around the old Myers house to stone it is interesting as well.Any attempts at realism are sacrificed for clichés. ""Halloween II"" came out during the slasher boom that followed the original. If any film could have resisted the conventions of the genre, it would have been the sequel to the one that started it all. Instead, ""Halloween II' gleefully conforms. The hospital is surprisingly empty, like a summer camp that I could name. Cars won't start when needed. At least there's a reason for that, though when Michael had time to slash every tire in the lot, I don't know. Maybe he did at the same time he cut the phone lines? The spring-loaded cat and fake-out scares are presented and accounted for. Myers embodies the slow moving killer, allowing his would-be victim plenty of time to escape. After Michael is seemingly knocked dead, some idiot leans over the body, allowing the killer to spring back up and kill him. By far the biggest cliché ""Halloween II"" practices is a larger cast, filled with indistinct victims that serve no purpose other then to up the body count. Is the Shape stabbing a truly random teenager to death or murdering folks with the claw-end of a hammer out of character? Maybe, maybe not. But it sure doesn't feel natural.The most unnatural move is Laurie Strode being revealed as Myers' long lost sister. Carpenter has admitted to pulling that story turn out of his butt. Like making Regan McNeil as magical healer in ""Exorcist II,"" it robs the first film of its frightening randomness. Michael Myers is no longer a roving, destructive force of nature. Now he has an agenda. Worse yet, it's a totally unneeded development. The killer continuing to stalk his surviving victim wasn't motivation enough? There are many things I dislike about ""Halloween: The Franchise,"" but that reoccurring plot line is the thing I most hate.Rick Rosenthal is no John Carpenter. He employs Carpenter's tracking shots a few time but always in service of a POV. Rosenthal does away with John's color palette. The night is black, with none of those cool blues. His scene presentation is flat. Rosenthal's talent instead lies in striking near-still photography. His best moments are when the camera stops to focus on an eerie, empty frame. A hospital door slowly blowing open, a knife in a desk, a body lying in a pool of blood. No, Rosenthal isn't Carpenter but he does show some talent.The first film didn't leave much room for returning cast members. Jamie Lee Curtis probably couldn't say no to her biggest hit's sequel. Yet her disinterest in returning is evident. Laurie spends the majority of ""Halloween II"" lying in bed, drowsy from medication. She still has that spirit to survive but there's little life behind Curtis' eyes. This is truly Donald Pleasence's show. Loomis is far more unhinged this time, shouting and screaming, pulling guns on people, and running around like a madman. It's the first suggestion of the doctor being as dangerous as his patient. Donald even gets another monologue that nearly rivals the ""Blackest Eyes"" speech, a backseat discussion about Celtic rituals and humanity's inner darkness. Is it any wonder the Pleasence's increasingly sloppy drunk performance would become the best thing about the further sequels? The new additions don't make as much of an impression. Lance Guest is flat as the guy who develops romantic feelings for Laurie for no particular reason. Leo Rossi plays the traditional slasher movie jerk, a vulgar, abrasive ambulance driver named Budd. Pamela Susan Shoop is incredibly beautiful as his girlfriend, Karen. Some review I read years ago described her as having ""perfect breasts"" and I can't say I disagree. As for the rest of the new cast? Empty, every single one of them, generic slasher fodder. The drunk doctor, the tough black nurse, the other nurse, the other other nurse, that's as much character development as you get.As ""Halloween II"" goes on, it starts to win me over. The movie toys seriously with killing Laurie off, which makes her constant peril more involving. Myers slowly appearing behind a victim and sticking her with a needle, though blatantly derivative of the first film, works well. A car horn or a door that won't open raise the stakes nicely, our heroine coming close to being caught. Michael Myers isn't Jason or Freddy so I've never liked his creative kills but, I have to admit, lifting a victim up with a blade? That's cool. There's a loud musical sting whenever the killer jumps out. Yeah, Laurie shows amazing accuracy for someone who's probably never handled a gun before. As much as it pains me to say it, ""Halloween II"" delivers on the scares, belabored and engineered though they might be.""Halloween II"" is probably as good as a sequel that starts with a continuity error can be. It's unnecessary and I take issue with many of its stylistic and story decision. But compared to what came after? Yeah, I'll take it. Should ""Halloween"" have ever been a series? No, probably not. But I'll take it anyway.",Halloween II
191,danielll_rs,"Worse than the original, but still scares",6,30 November 1999,"'A sequel is never better than the original film' Well... This may be true, specially if we're talking about horror movies. ""Halloween II"" is surely worse than ""Halloween"", a true classic, but it is not bad at all by itself.The story happens at the same Halloween night of the first film, and that's the great point. Michael Myers didn't die, and Dr. Loomis is trying to find him, while Laurie Strode is at the hospital. However, she is not safe at all, and Michael is still chasing her, with a shocking revelation.The screenplay is OK, keeping our attention and scaring us. There are some clichés, but they don't make the film bad. ""Halloween II"" is a worth seeing if you like horror movies. It is surely better than the other ""Halloween"" sequels.",Halloween II

Michael Myers seems to escape after the fall and then hide away from Doctor Samuel Loomis as he searches the streets for him, Michael then escapes to find Laurie. He ends up finding her in the Haddonfield Hospital.Not as good as the original though this sequel picks up well after it and like the original, this film does it's suspense well.8.5/10",Halloween II
193,MovieFan983,A great sequel!,9,10 February 1999,"his is one of the best sequels in horror film history. Although it's not as good as the original, it's still a great follow-up, that only lacks some terror that the first had. What's really clever about it is that it starts off right where the original left off, that night right after Mike got killed. He then gets up, and goes to find Laurie to kill her. She is in a hospital, where of course Mike follows her, but this time he has lots more people to kill on the way to get her. The movie is very stylishly directed, and sometimes suspenseful movie. And of course as sequels go, it's far more bloodier and more violent than the first film, which goes away from what Halloween's point was. You don't need blood and gore to make movies scary. But still it's a great sequel, that everyone who hasn't seen H1 you need to. A 9 out of 10. Rated R for strong horror violence and gore, some nudity, and brief language.",Halloween II

195,jake-law123,Just what I expected.,6,27 October 2010,"I didn't really expect much out of this one. I already knew it was gonna suck, and it wouldn't be as good as the first, but I watched it anyway. It didn't suck as bad, but still pretty bad. The kills are more creative, but a little stupid, the idea is gay, and some of the things in the movie are retarded. Plus, its basically somewhat the same story as the first, just a different time.It takes place the same exact night right where the first left off. Michael is on the loose while the doctor goes and hunts him down some more like he did in the first. Meanwhile, Laurie is sent to the hospital, and as you would guess, Michael still wants to kill her, which is why he heads straight there. The hospital is where most of the movie takes place, and it just turns into a stupid slapstick ""horror"" film. Plus, for a horror film, its really not that scary.All its trying to do is copy and be like the first, only with more gruesome kills, but ultimately fails. The Carpenter theme returns, with a half hour long opening. Good luck trying to stay awake, because it takes awhile for things to get moving. Most of the time, people are just fooling around, and not much happens. The ending is where most of the stuff happens.The dumbest scene in the film is where they mistake Michael with another kid wearing the exact same mask! As he's being chased, he runs in the middle of the road, and gets run over by a cop car, which rams him into another car in the middle of the road, piercing him in the middle. The scene made me almost cry to how much they mocked the first.As I expected, it sucked. But i'll admit that it still devotes itself to the original, and if it had to be made, then find, make it. Just make it less stupid.",Halloween II
196,refinedsugar,Inferior to the original,5,25 July 2000,"Why do sequels always seem to be a coin toss for the losing side? I've become quite skeptical about them. Most are unnecessary, very rarely meet or surpass standards set and may or may not entertain. Now that doesn't mean I've written off sequels once and for all. Once in a blue moon one comes along that stands up along side or even bests the original and I actually enjoy it more. Unfortunately Halloween 2 is not one of those times.H2 is the type of sequel that lives up to the bias against sequels. Simply put, the original Halloween did so much right and H2 does so much wrong. A quick cash-in follow up that retains some of the elements we know and/or love, but throws the rest out like the baby in the bath water. Losing much of its identity along the way. Anyone who thinks this sequel can hold a candle to the original is blind to what the original did so wonderfully.The two principle cast members (in Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis) are along for the ride again, but everything is different now. John Carpenter has returned this time to only pen the script and its far from his finest hour. Rick Rosenthal at the helm can either be damned or excused if you want to wade through the semi-sordid production history behind this opus.Now I could blabber on about how the original is a classic film. How it did so much without gore or heavy violence and depended more on suspense and atmosphere. How it had logical characters we cared about and a story while simple was also kind of masterful in execution. Then I could elaborate about how brain-dead at the core H2's characters, settings and story is, but how about instead I talk about what H2 does right and saves it from the bottom of the barrel.As a fan of the series, I've always felt Donald Pleasence has been the backbone and H2 is no different. His ranting, banter with Brackett for the first half of H2, memorable quotes and just general crazy behavior is a lot of fun. The mythology of Samhain was a nice little diversion from the flat story. JLC fares well in her return, Warlock isn't a bad Shape, I liked Hunter von Leer as Deputy Hunt, the music is still great and the ending is pretty good as well.Picking up literately where the first movie left off, H2 isn't a god awful mess, a lot of people enjoy it, but it also isn't on the level already established. By no means the weakest entry in the Michael Myers saga, it also isn't its strongest sequel.",Halloween II
197,RickHarvey,an brilliant sequel,8,22 November 2009,"What I love about this sequel is that it continues straight after the first. So rather seeing the characters two years in the future, you actually only see them a second into the future. Halloween 2 is set on the same night and same place . I think this was an excellent idea. If you remembered watching the original in 1978 in pure shock, then just imagine going back to the same night three years later in 1981.It fair to say that Halloween 2 keeps faithful to the original. It continues to play with the terror of voyeurism. Often you spot Michael watching his prey and often you are placed in the shoes of the killer. The only difference between the two films is that in Halloween 2, you are forced more to look through the eyes of the killer while only a few time will you see Michael in the background while vice versa for the original. Credit to the production team as when watching the film, you still do truly feel like your back in Haddonfield on that Halloween night. Nothing has changed . For all the positives that I gave for the original also obliges for this one.There is one big negative in the film and that is Michael himself. He moves very oddly and differently in this one than he did in the first. It if there trying to block out any emotion coming from Michael. Yes , he is played by two different people but that no excuse. The second body actor should of learnt Michael style of movement. But that the only negative I can think off that really matters. It a worthy sequel and well worth watching. If you loved the first then there no reason why you shouldn't love this one.",Halloween II
198,duce122,Well...,6,27 October 1999,"Halloween II (1981) C-93 min.  D: Rick Rosenthal. Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence, Charles Cyphers, Jeffrey Kramer, Lance Guest, Dick Warlock. This film got horrible reviews, which it did not deserve. Michael Myers continues to wreak havoc on the same night as the original. This film begins immediately following the end of HALLOWEEN. Most of the film takes place in the understaffed, dark, eerie hospital. The blood and gore in this film is so excessive and after a while makes the film less and less scary. Warlock (as the Shape) has way too much screen time, ruining all the mystery behind Michael Myers that worked so well in the original. Curtis has about ten lines the whole movie and Pleasance overacts as Dr. Loomis. Cyphers (as Leigh Brackett) receives co-star billing but disappears after the first ten minutes. On the plus side, the film is scary at certain moments. HALLOWEEN was much better!! RATING: 6 out of 10. Rated R for some language, graphic blood and gore, violence, nudity, and brief sexuality.",Halloween II
199,shaun98,Routine sequel,5,27 April 2002,"One viewing of the first ""Halloween"" sequel will immediately confirm that it was designed for commercial, not creative, purposes. This fact is probably the main focus in the critical texture of the film, as James Berardinelli indicated. It's a passable follow-up, competently made, but lacks the artistry of the original. In fact, I believe John Carpenter himself expressed his dissatisfaction with the results. It panders to the slasher formula by including more graphic bloodshed for the sake of profit. I think we could have gone by without the infamous hot tub scene, for example.In honoring the conventions of eighties horror, most of the characters are disposable at best, obnoxious at worse. At least one character is so grating that we actively root for Michael to kill him, a complete reversal of what its predecessor accomplished. Otherwise, most of the young cast generates our indifference, not our sympathy. However, I liked Lance Guest, although I wished he was given more to do. It doesn't help that is ultimate fate is unresolved. (In the television cut, he indeed survives, but that does not excuse the filmmakers from neglecting this loose end.) Donald Pleasance, reprising the role of Dr. Loomis, is entertaining in an over-the-top performance, but Jamie Lee Curtis is wasted until the third act.Let's talk about the structure of the film as a whole. It picks up right after the original left off, as Michael Myers continues his business. The first part is fairly entertaining in that regard, although not nearly as eerie as the original. The midsection is strictly average slasher fare, tedious and disjointed to boot. However, the film is somewhat redeemed by an entertaining finale, as Laurie Strode (Curtis) awakens, only to be pursued by Michael. This portion of the film managed to engage me; it's everything a slasher should be: tight and suspenseful, but by then, it's too little, too late. Too bad; if the whole thing was like that, I'd recommend it with no reservations.** (out of ****)Released by Universal Pictures",Halloween II

Not nearly as great as the first but the presence of a more fleshed out Loomis played by Donald Pleasance makes this movie worth watching. My favorite scenes in this movie are actually between Loomis and the sheriff...humorously done I wish I had gotten more of that.
The kills here are more Friday The 13th than Michael Myers so it felt less urgent than the original. Still it was better than any of the uneven movies that were to come until Rob Zombie gave a bloody shot to arm of the franchise.",Halloween II

I wasn't a fan of the original Halloween, so it's easy to say that I had little to no expectations going into this.Halloween II starts right after the events of the first Halloween and it ultimately feels like the same film in a different location. I found Halloween II to be full of lazy, bland storytelling, lackluster 2D characters, and cheap scares just like the original.Ultimately I wasn't too impressed with this, it's definitely not the worst horror movie i've seen, I just don't think these movies are for me.It also probably didn't help that I watched this pretty much 6 months after I watched the original considering I feel like this was made to be a double feature.",Halloween II

204,Lucabrasisleeps,As good as the original,7,23 January 2015,"Honestly speaking, I would have loved to give the movie a higher rating. But towards the end, I thought the movie lost a little bit of steam. But still it was quite a ride. The obvious differences are in the gore. Obviously this movie is not shy of showing gore. They try all kinds of killing methods in this movie, so I guess this is the 80s slasher effect. While in the first halloween movie, they make it simple and the killer has limited methods of murder. Here Michael experiments with different ideas. And the body count just explodes in this one. He has no time to freak people out and watch them do things. He needs to get to the business right away. The pace is the biggest difference. There are a flurry of murders in this one in the first hour itself. Then the movie slows down and tries to go back to the pace of the first Halloween movie. I thought it was a nice idea to just resume from the ending of the 1st movie. I don't know how many sequels do that. Mostly they just do a ""3 years later"" kind of a thing and move on. But here somehow they try to recreate everything (though this movie is made 3 years later) continue the story from that time itself. Jamie Lee curtis doesn't have many lines at all in the movie. I guess nobody has time to discuss girl talk and gossip. Of course there is the clichéd jerk character who is necessary for some nudity or light moments (in the midst of all the carnage of course). There is only one scene of nudity which doesn't really affect the pace of the movie. The indestructible concept again raises its ugly head again. Maybe this is one idea I was never comfortable with. But it would have been cool if they had just ended with this sequel. Because he seems bigger than all vampires put together. Because they have some weaknesses, this guy has none. This may be controversial but I enjoyed this movie more than the first. But since it lost a little bit of steam towards the end, I think I need to rate it the same as the first. But the ending is still a cool moment. 7/10",Halloween II
205,boyinflares,A Fun and Frightening Sequel,8,30 November 2005,"""Halloween II"" (along with ""Halloween: H20"") are quite possibly the best Halloween sequels, and with good reason - they both feature the esteemed Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays Laurie Strode with such passion and gives her great depth. What's cool about ""Halloween II"" is that it isn't just another sequel, it is a continuation of the first film, set on the same night as the original (though of course it was filmed some years after wards). ""Halloween II"" is also the film in which it is revealed that Laurie Strode and Michael Meyers are sister and brother.The cast are a mixed lot in this film. In addition to the terrific Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasance stars as Dr. Loomis, and as per usual, does a great job portraying a character which he will portray in a total of five ""Halloween"" films. Charles Cyphers returns also as the town's Sheriff, and Nancy Stephens makes a welcome appearance as Marion Chambers. Stephens is a fantastic actress and she is given a lot more to do in this film than the first, and her hair is awesome! She will later return in ""Halloween H20"" also. With the exception of Pamela Susan Shoop who plays Nurse Karen, the rest of the cast are given little depth.Setting the film in a hospital on Halloween night is a nice idea, for it gives a very chilling feel. However the hospital seems rather devoid of patients, even if it is late at night. The death scenes are also a little more inventive this time round, in particular Nurse Karen meets a very gruesome and painful demise. Admittedly there are flaws in this film - particularly in the continuity department, and apparently a lot of deleted scenes. So while viewing ""Halloween II"" it would probably be best to view it straight after watching the original ""Halloween"" and think of it not as a sequel, but the continuing terror of Michael Meyers, and plight of Laurie Strode!",Halloween II
206,cLoNe,Better than the first one..!,9,10 August 1999,The good thing about this movie is the fact that it skips the too long built up the first movie had and goes straight to the slash fest. A bigger body count with more inventive murders make this movie a classic.,Halloween II

Upon viewing this film, one might wonder why would a hospital have such poor lighting? How come they don't have very many doctors, nurses or patients?

210,piratecannon,"You Knew a Sequel Was Inevitable, Right?",8,27 December 2012,"It was bound to happen. After the success of the original film, a sequel to Halloween was a virtual certainty. Three years later, the blood-thirsty masses were finally treated to what they'd been clamoring for–the return of Michael Myers.Halloween II isn't your typical follow-up, though. It takes place only minutes after the first movie has concluded, with Laurie Strode (Curtis) being carted off to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital to receive treatment for her wounds. Michael, of course, has vanished, and Dr. Loomis continues his mad dash around town in a vain attempt to put down the deranged mass murderer once and for all.Most of the action takes place in the hospital where Laurie is being kept, and the layout of the place makes it, in essence, a labyrinth of darkened hallways that disorient viewers. This, of course, is the point, because it's entirely possible that Michael will pop out from anywhere at any second, ratcheting up the tension to admirable heights.There are a few other quirks about Halloween II that stand out as particularly unusual, especially the lead characters' constant puzzlement over the fact that Michael was shot six times at point blank range and lived to tell the tale. In most modern horror movies, it's a foregone conclusion that the baddie is an indestructible monster who can be hindered but never truly eliminated. Since this is one of the first films to transform what would otherwise be an entirely human villain into a Terminator-esque menace to society, I suppose the filmmakers thought it prudent to mention this more than once—as if doing so would cause the audience to say, ""Yeah, that's true–how the heck is he still alive!?"" In a way, this strategy does have its intended effect, but viewers are ever given a satisfying explanation as to why Michael can be stabbed, shot, burned and (essentially) be no worse for the wear. There are a few tidbits thrown into the story regarding Druids, pagan rituals and the like, but, again, this does little to sate the curiosity regarding Michael's seemingly invincible persona.Aside from a handful of quibbles that are admittedly minor, Halloween II is a solid stand alone horror film. I got the feeling that director Rick Rosenthal was doing everything he could to mimic Carpenter's style, and there's not necessarily anything wrong with that. In fact, the same iconic first-person perspective shots, cheap scares, ""slow burns"" are all present, and, much to my surprise, almost all of these strategies work just as well as they did the first time around.It's rare that a sequel succeeds in bottling some of the magic that made its forerunner a hit, but Halloween II manages the task (and handily, I might add).Oh, before I forget, here are some memorably creepy scenes to keep an eye out for: Michael walking through a plate glass door without missing a step; the ""bled"" nurse and the pool of blood; and, of course, the finale, which sees Laurie shoot Michael in both eyes just before blowing him up.Well played, Mr. Myers. Well played indeed.",Halloween II

It's like the first never ended and were just picking up were you left off. Halloween 2 follows Laurie Strode to the hospital and were she goes Michael is not far behind. Because the film is set late at night, some scenes are difficult to see because there is darkness everywhere, but this just adds to the suspense and atmosphere of the whole film. All though the first one was great I think Halloween 2 was actually better than the first, i don't now why but the second one got my attention more than the first. It doesn't really mater cause they're both great and I would recommend you to watch them both, one after the other. Halloween 2 offers what all good  horror movies have violence, sex, and a realy scary atmosphere.

Halloween had great potential for a sequel, but the writers, director, the actors, and everyone else associated with this mess sure blew it here.  I don't know what they were thinking when they made this monstrosity, or maybe they weren't thinking at all is more likely.Whereas in the original Halloween, John Carpenter built suspense with things we couldn't see, and things that go bump in the night, here we get scenes thrown in just to see how shocked we will be.*********Possible Plot Giveaways Ahead If You Really Care*********** We pick up this movie exactly where the first one left off.Donald Pleasance returns in his role as Michael Myers own personal psychiatrist, but plays the role as if he could have used a couple of valium himself.  Jamie Lee is back of course, and is carted quickly away to the most unlikely hospital you'd ever want to be cured in.  Not only is there hardly anybody working at this hospital,there aren't any patients either, other than Laurie.  Imagine, your own private hospital.  We do see a kid going into the hospital with a big piece of glass stuck in his mouth,because he ate something out of his Trick or Treat bag before Momma checked it out. The scene is totally pointless, put in simply for some kind of shock value, and probably spooking a lot of parents into not letting their kids go Trick or Treat come Halloween Night.I have been in hospitals late at night, even small hospitals such as the strange one in this movie and none of them were ever as quiet as this one. There is so little to do in this place, that even the Nurse has time to go down to the whirlpool room to have a quickie with the Ambulance Driver who just happens to be her sleazy boyfriend.  Of course, we know as soon as they go in there they've had it and that the whole thing is a setup for Michael Myers to perform another of his horrifying deeds.  All the while we've yet to see any other patients, or see their room lights going on so I guess if you're in this place, you fend for yourself.By the time Lance Guest, slips on a pool of blood, knocking himself out, we're in hysterics....that's laughing hysterically from how ridiculous the whole thing is.  Jamie Lee Curtis is given little to do here except lie in her bed looking distraught, then crawl and limp around the hospital looking scared.  Fortunately, her career would recover, if not her leg.
This movie was scribbled by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, misdirected by Rick Rosenthal so that John Carpenter wouldn't have to take the blame entirely I suppose.  If anything else, this film should have permanently sunk the franchise, but like the famous bunny, it just keeps going and going and going and going......Too bad for us.",Halloween II
213,IrisNo11,"Suspenceful, But It Doesn't Top the First One",7,27 August 1999,"Like I said about first movies being better than the sequal, I must say that in this case, the first movie was for sure better than the sequal (yet it is vice versa w/ ""Carrie"" and ""The Rage:  Carrie 2""...in my opinion).I thought that the movie was suspenceful, but it didn't match the suspence or the excitement it had in the first one.  I thought it was a good idea to pick up from where the first movie left off, but I thought that this movie went a little more slow, cause our heroine, Laurie, is in the hospital and Mike Myers is out killing more people.  So, having Laurie in the hospital waiting for a miracle made this movie move a little slow, in my opinion. That's why I rated this 7.So, my opinion is that the first ""Halloween"" was a lot better.  Yet if you are a big ""Halloween"" fan, you can't miss this.",Halloween II
214,chris330r,A great sequel but leaves some questions,9,24 October 2021,"This continuation of ""Halloween"" manages to keep the same atmosphere and essence of part 1. Even though it's filmed 2 years after the first one, it still feels like that same night just a few hours later. These 2 parts are definitely bookends that should be viewed together.And this is where we learn the important key fact that Michael is Laurie's biological sister which is the whole POINT of him going after her. No matter how modern Hollywood wants to omit this KEY fact in their insipid ""re-imagination"" cash grab, Michael will ALWAYS be Laurie's sister because that's the whole point of the story and true fans know this.The only thing that's never explained is where Laurie was the night Michael killed Judith. She was only 2 at the time living with the Myers but her parents were out alone together, so little Laurie had to be in the house at the time when the murder took place.If Michael wanted his sisters dead, why didn't he kill little Laurie after killing Judith? Did he just prefer to wait until she was grown up to off her?! It's illogical when you think about it.Also, halfway through the film, all the lights are suddenly out in the hospital and no one seems to make any mention of it, yet when the phones went out earlier they sent someone to check on it quickly. Why didn't anyone care when the lights went out?I still give it a 9 rating because it's one of the best horror sequels made. I guess we're not supposed to overthink the plot too much.",Halloween II
215,lostintwinpeaks,MORE OF THE NIGHT HE CAME HOME - IN THE EMPTIEST HOSPITAL EVER!,5,3 August 2002,"Continuing on from where the original left off - literally; it picks right up, and continues through the same night (cue some continuity goofs as though still set on the same night, it is filmed almost two years later).Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode, and Rick Rosenthal does a good job with the directing (he's the man behind the most recent Halloween movie ""Halloween: Resurrection"" - a sequel to the original, this one, and ""H20"") - though of course he is by far inferior to John Carpenter.Interestingly this features probably the emptiest hospital ever committed to celluiod. Apart from a few babies, Laurie Strode seems to be the only patient!!",Halloween II
216,CowherPowerForever,I shot him 6 times!,9,23 October 2014,"The following review will contain spoilers.Three years after the original Halloween film was made, the powers that be behind the original classic wanted another film. With John Carpenter off doing other projects, first time full length film director Rick Rick Rosenthal took over for the legend John Carpenter. While Rosenthal is rarely remembered for this film, I personally hold the opinion that this Halloween movie is not only the best film that was made after the original Halloween, but one of the best sequel ever made. The following is my review of Halloween 2.John Carpenter and Debra Hill both returned to write this sequel. They sought out the idea to have the film continue exactly where the original film left off. While this story is hardly remembered for being original like the first film is, I still believe Hill and Carpenter delivered a fantastic story. A twist in this sequel was that we found out that Michael Myers had another sister, and her name was Laurie Strode. Some fans even to this day question the logic behind this twist, but considering the powers that be behind the cameras wanted a sequel, I found this plot device to be worked out rather nicely. While Carpenter and Hill will always be remember for the fantastic work they dished out on the first film, I truly hope that in the following decades that people do not forget their fine efforts for this amazing sequel.The film was directed by Rick Rosenthal, and this film was his first effort at directing a feature length film. While Rosenthal is clearly no John Carpenter, I truly believe Rosenthal delivered a fantastic sequel, with some nice scares, even though the nudity and gore factor was turned up a notch on this film. This film was released during the time the slasher sub-genre was really taking off with films like Friday the 13th. Films like that had constant nudity and a great deal of gory deaths scenes. While this sequel did turn those factors up, I don't believe it ever hit the level of a Friday the 13th film. The scares aren't as great in turn because the extra blood flow is actually trying to scare you a little more than the thought of the kill, like in the original film. While this pushes the film down in my opinion, it really doesn't hurt it much because it never reached that high level of gore like other franchises hit in the 1980s.Back from the first film, Jamie Lee Curtis is truly a delight to have back for this sequel. She turned out one heck of a performance in the original film, and this film wouldn't have been the same without her. Some many times horror films suffer from bland acting. Not in a film like this with Jamie Lee Curtis. As I mentioned above, her character has a big twist to her in this sequel. She finds out she is the sister of Michael Myers. Shocking twist that Jamie Lee handles amazingly and really sells it. Back to play his famous role of Dr. Sam Loomis, legend Donald Pleasence once again is playing this very important role. The fact that Pleasence agreed to make this sequel is a shock considering how big of an actor he was, an even bigger shock though is the fact that Pleasence did three more of these movies after part two, for a total of five movies. To play a character like this for an actor like Pleasence is something amazing. So many fans love what he did with the character of Sam Loomis, and to do this he is one of my favorite actors.So overall, Rick Rosenthal gets a big thumbs up in my opinion for his amazing work on this film. While his efforts cannot possibly top that of what John Carpenter did on the first film, he lays out a fantastic effort for this sequel.Alan Howarth was tasked to mold the score of the first film into this sequel, while John Carpenter was off doing other projects. At this time the sequel was being made Howarth was doing work with John Carpenter on Escape from New York. In the 1980s, John Carpenter was known for using Synthesizers in his scores because it was so easy to use. Well, Howarth used this technique in this sequel to mold the score and update it. While the original score by Carpenter will always be my favorite, this score has to be my second of the franchise. It just adds so much deep depth to the film. I cannot get enough of it. Alan Howarth was given the task of molding the score from the first film and giving it an update for this sequel, and in my opinion he did a fabulous job.In closing, Halloween 2 might be overlooked by some of the fans who aren't deep into this franchise like myself, and that is a shame. While it doesn't really hold as well as the original, it does a fantastic job of being an amazing sequel in the horror genre. Which are very rare in this genre. Those of us fans of this franchise mostly consider this sequel to be at least good and one of the better films of the series. Those who maybe never had interest in this film because they don't like sequels, well, I can honestly say you are missing out on one heck of a great film.9/10",Halloween II
217,moviemattb,"Can't beat the original, but its a solid sequel",8,15 October 2018,"In ""Halloween II,"" the film picks up right where the first movie left off, as Michael Myers survives from getting shot by Sam Loomis, and continues to kill more victims, and try to finish of Laurie Strode. Now Loomis must protect Laurie from Michael and Laurie must survive before its too late. Its hard to top on what made the original ""Halloween,"" a classic, which sadly you can't as it had already set the bar really high, and now there is nothing you can do about it. On the other hand, ""Halloween II,"" does its job for making this a fun sequel. The movie is really faithful to what John Carpenter did with the first one, and Rick Rosenthal, the director really shows that he wanted to be true to first movie; he succeeds really well and got to give him props for doing it. The cinematography is done by Dean Cundey once again, and does another marvelous job as he knows how to shoot film really well. The visuals are about as good as what the first one did, and the atmosphere itself its about as good as the first one. The filmmakers have put their darnest to make this sequel as faithful as possible. The movie is not perfect by any means, but thankfully, the movie didn't turned out to become a disaster. The music is done by John Carpenter with Alan Howarth, which I enjoy, but I prefer the traditional classic piano music that first one did. The story is written by Carpenter and Debra Hill, and thought it was written fine, but not the greatest there is. The performance are done well, but I give most props to Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis. The other characters are alright, but not as interesting as Sam Loomis, Laurie Strode, and Michael Myers. The movie does feature gore, than what the first one did, but it really doesn't hurt the movie. I enjoy it, but the director didn't want it, as he wanted to be like the first movie. Carpenter, instead re shot the certain scenes for the movie as he thought it will appeal the audience a bit more. Not a strong move. If the movie didn't have gore, then maybe it would have been the most faithful sequel to the original ""Halloween,"" and whether or not it could have been a perfect sequel. The idea of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode to be brother and sister is fine, but nothing much I can say about. I know the new one will ignore that concept, but I can take it one way or the other. ""Halloween II,"" is nowhere near as good as the first one, but for what it is, its a good movie. Can't beat the original, but its a solid sequel. I'm giving it an 8 out of 10.",Halloween II

Rick Rosenthal continues the John Carpenter directional style and he did it on a faster pace than the first one. It makes the movie is more enjoyable for now age viewers. Jamie Lee-Curtis is still at her best. I would not deface her name, because she's the best.

223,scott-sw,Decent sequel,7,30 December 2007,"Halloween II is evidence that Hollywood cannot leave anything alone, nor can they resist to slap a corporate label on something they wished they had. Halloween was an indie film that terrorized a nation in 1978. As this started the slasher craze and spawned rip-offs like Friday the 13th, Universal stepped in to ""help."" We pick up right after the end of the original Halloween when Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) finds his patient, Michael Myers, missing. Lauire (Jamie Lee Curtis) is rushed to the hospital, and Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) discovers the three bodies in the house across the street, and one of them is his daughter. Let's start with my gripes on this movie. First, while John Carpenter and Debra Hill work on the new screenplay, the director reins go to Rick Rosenthal. I do not want to say Rosenthal was bad, but for many of the scenes, he just copied Carpenter's style. Second, Laurie did not have much to do in this film. In the first one, she works against Michael Myers, but now is doped up on pain killers and becomes too passive. Finally, the Michael Myers personality goes awry. In the first place, the Shape is now played by Dick Warlock. One might think ""anyone can play him with that blank mask."" Not so. The moves are more robotic instead of pathologic patience. This might come from Rosenthal who also has Michael kill one person he really did not need to kill. In the first one, he only kills to set-up a trap. Moreover, to display his strength, in one scene he lifts a nurse off the floor with a scalpel. I'm sorry, that scene was moronic. Even more problematic is a scene when Michael simply ""walks"" through a glass door. Sorry, I cannot buy that one. However, there are some good things for Halloween II. The first is Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis. He plays the part with such passion, persistence, and persuasion. He tries to buck the system, makes passionate pleas that make no sense--all for the cause of stopping evil incarnate. Also, Michael Myers has a personality in there somewhere. It almost surfaces when Laurie calls out to him. He listens to Dr. Loomis when the dedicated Psychiatrist warns him of a coming demise. Finally, Rosenthal does make some good scenes. In one, Michael appears out of the shadow to murder a nurse. In another, he gives us the suspense of another nurse mistaking Michael for her boyfriend. One of the most terrifying is another nurse discovering all the tires in the parking lot. The audience will get a true sense of despair in that one. So overall, Halloween II is worthwhile. I wished they would have stopped there.",Halloween II
224,evilnigga,Wack,3,9 November 2021,"It is written by John Carpenter but I feel like I was watching a completely different movie than the first one. It is pretty sad that it fell that low because I genuinely enjoyed the first one. The movie doesn't have the creepy feeling of the original, it felt like a complete rip off. One good thing is they still pretty much have the same score and that is probably the only thing I like about this movie. Since it takes place mostly on hospital there are a lot of things Michael can use, and it is fun to see how he uses it. The characters are pretty much the same, they're still the idiots that they were, but the acting in this is definitely worst than the first one.",Halloween II
225,RomanJamesHoffman,Respectable follow-up to a horror classic,7,30 November 2012,"'Halloween' was an independently produced surprise box-office smash which took various aspects from fledgling slasher movies and assorted Italian giallo and crafted them into a coherent spellbinding whole which along with 'Friday the 13th' opened the door for franchises, imitations, and franchises of imitations. As such, when I earnestly resolved to sit through 'Halloween 2' (having seen only disappointing snippets of various entries in the franchise which had melded in my mind into a homogenous blob) I felt sure I would be testing my boredom threshold. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the movie which, while obviously not as good as the original, stands up to it admirably.The first item of note is the interesting premise that, as the first film explicitly left room for a sequel, 'Halloween 2' literally wastes no time and picks up immediately where the last one left off and concentrates on the continuing efforts of Loomis (Pleasance) and the police to capture Michael Myers on the same evening. Furthermore, the main locale shifts to the local hospital where Laurie Strode (a dialogue-less Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken and where Myers ventures in a desire to finish the job. In addition to the main actors reprising their role, the fact that the screenplay was written by Carpenter and the fact that Rick Rosenthal's direction mimics Carpenter's effectively makes the film feel like a seamless continuation from the original. However the film distinguishes itself from the original through the locale shift to the deserted corridors of the hospital and the visceral quality to the kills (for example the bath scene) which brought to my mind the stylised deaths in Italian giallo films a la Dario Argento.The later films in the franchise (excluding the failed experiment of the under-rated Halloween 3: Season of the Witch) would resurrect Myers ad nauseum and ultimately the franchise went to the point of unintentional parody and robbed the slasher genre of everything that made it great. However, if watched alongside the original, 'Halloween 2' offers a convincing continuation of the nightmare.",Halloween II

227,legendaryunderdog,The Best Horror Movie I have Ever Seen.,10,17 July 2007,"I would give this movie a 20 out of 10 if I could but it wouldn't make sense . My point by typing that is that this movie exceeds sequel expectations and thensome. The original Halloween scared millions into submission back in 1978, three years later in 1981 director Rick Rosenthal teamed up with John Carpenter and Debra Hill (Director/Writer of the original) to write a script for the next movie 'Halloween 2'. What impressed me was Rosenthals attention to detail, meaning he re-captured the entire ending of the first movie and played it back again into his new movie and somehow tied the end of the first movie and the beginning of his movie together and went from there, absolute genius is what I call that. What follows is an hour and a half of suspense, chills, trauma, gore, you name it, it's in here. Donald Pleasance joins the team to reprise his role of Dr. Sam Loomis, Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode, Charles Cyphers (a Carpenter movie regular) reprises his role as Sheriff Lee Brackett, Nancy Loomis makes a short cameo as Lee Brackett's daughter Annie (whom Michael got in the first film). This installment is just plain awesome to me, the old characters are back, the theme music is updated but is still just as creepy with now a synthesizer effect added to it. The ending could be considered questionable but I guess that depends if you've seen the TV version or the regular movie version. I'll let you make your own assessment as to how you feel the ending (or entire movie) was handled in general. A cinematic masterpiece, bossa nova. one million out of ten stars.",Halloween II

How 'bout a banana?Halloween 2, my pretty, what exactly went wrong with you? Why aren't you as revered as the original? I've seen this movie less than 10 times and I already know that I'm gonna rate it 5/10.5/10 is my ""I don't like it, I don't hate it"" rating.Something just hit me while watching the alternative ending for this movie! Was Halloween 2 a victim of its own success because of the original? Think ""Texas Chainsaw 2"" or ""Blair Witch 2."" All three original movies, small budget, BIG success. All three sequels bigger budgets, POORER movies.Loomis looks a bit like Bill Goldberg.Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love how this movie starts and the movie poster in the video stores back in the 80's used to be my favorite, but just, um, when they get up to the hospital scene it was kind of overbearing and smothered the storyline. It's like ""Back To The Future 3,"" love the start, but too much emphasis on the wild West.Was it Warlock's portrayal of Myers? We're not fans of replacements. Everyone screamed and shouted when Hodder was replaced in ""Friday the 13th.""This is a myth about razor blades in apples.Myers has struck already. That's 1-nil. He didn't even know that young girl. She didn't do nothing to him.Poor Annie makes a cameo as a corpse. She was my favorite in the original.I believe that's Dick Warlock's son holding the ghetto blaster in this scene? That's called nepotism. Keeping it in the family. Jobs for the boys in short.Is that Screech?Pizza HAS to have mushrooms on it, Budd.It's pretty much up until the 35-minute mark when I stop liking Halloween 2. The only other three notable scenes I like are the rioting house vandals, the charred dentistry examination, and the excellent school class Samhain lesson. Other than that it's all based in the hospital.Cheap jump scares with either a cat, or a box, falling on you degrades any attempted buildup to proper suspense.A clawhammer through the skull is not Myers style. It seems a bit erratic and un-Myers like.These rioters should have just burt Myers house down instead of vandalizing it.Hot tub murders, needles in eyes, needles in temples, even Myers hair is wrong - it's a different color, too. These are all reasons why part 2 loses face in my books.I read somewhere that Jamie Lee Curtis felt that her acting skills in this were wasted and that her ego deserved better than just hobbling around being a victim in waiting. Wonder what movie she did do right after Halloween 2? She wanted to be taken serious as an actress and not pigeon holed as a horror scream queen.This scene in the surgery room with all the blood dripping on the floor is silly as Screech slips over.Did Myers not think to put a spring in his step when chasing these little darlings?It must be true about needing a silver bullet to stop a certain breed of killer as regular ammo is just an iron supplement to them.And boom! Myers and Loomis both just died. I saw it with my own eyes. Their characters died in '81. So to sequel 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 - go to hell.""I'm not Myers. Myers is dead.""

It set the standard for what a slasher sequel would become: more blood, more gore, and a higher body count.  Where as the original took a more psychological, suspensful approach, part 2 dives more into the slasher/shock territory.  ""Halloween 2"" picks up exactly where the first one left off.  Laurie Strode is taken to a hospital for her wounds.  Michael Myers follows and wreaks murderous havoc on the unsuspecting crew of the hospital.  I like the approach that ""Halloween 2"" takes.  It makes it a much more enjoyable film to watch and I don't believe that it could have been done any better.  It definitely set the standard for the need for slasher films to have sequels, even if they were pointless and could not live up to the original.  I mean before ""Halloween 2"" very, very few horror films even had sequels....""The Exorcist"" being the only one I can think of, and we all know how disastrous that was!!  I think is very safe to say that ""Halloween 2"" created to ""horror movie franchise"" craze that has become so popular, even today.  And with good reason, it is not a bad film by any means.

Carpenter's music is back, great as in the first movie. The story is tied together and ends with Michael Myers being blown up and dying surrounded by fire before the eyes of his sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis)The plot that Michael and Laurie are siblings only became a reality, due to extra scenes that had to be shot to make the length of Halloween reach the benchmark to get on TV, and that plot John Carpenter did not like at all.There is one scene that unfortunately makes this movie not get 10/10, and that is the elevator scene, for two reasons:1) Elevator doors are designed to open if they are blocked from closing, which Michael Myers does.2) Laurie does not press any buttons, they are all seen dark, so Michael could just press the elevator and it would open.Fantastic Halloween movie.",Halloween II

235,jrs-8,A great blown opportunity,5,18 February 2004,"If there was one movie I'd love to see remade it's ""Halloween 2"". How the filmmakers blew this one I will never know. They had the blueprints of a classic original topped with one of the creepiest killers in movie history. Where does it all go wrong? Let me count a few of the ways.First we are not given any new characters to care about. If you're going to make a sequel and keep the main characters from the original off screen for periods of time then you had better give us people we care about. Give us people we can root for. Don't introduce them and then kill them off. If the director doesn't care about his characters then why should we? Also, why keep Donald Pleasance off screen so much? It appears he has the lead but if you look closely he comes and goes quickly in each scene save for the last fifteen minutes. Another blown opportunity was getting rid of Charles Cypher's character no more then 15 minutes into the movie. Yes he lost his daughter Annie but give him the strength, as sheriff of Haddonfield, to join the hunt with Donald Pleasance. Then we REALLY would have cared.Second and most important is the violence/suspense level. In the original Michael Myers stalked his prey. He watched them from a far and up close and we, the audience, went crazy with anticipation because the level of suspense is so thick. Michael Myers had a purpose in killing the victims he chose. There was nothing random about it and we knew it too. In ""Halloween 2"" all of that is thrown out the window in the very first scene after the credits. Michael attacks a young woman just outside her house for no apparent reason except to kill. Right there we know it's going to be a cheat. Sure enough every victim is random. There is no purpose to these characters dying except that most of them were unfortunate enough to work in a hospital.
The violence level is ten notches higher here than in the original. In sickening detail we see a hammer to the forehead, a needle in the eye, a woman scalded to death and so on. ""At the 60 minute mark ""Halloween 2"" had become nothing more then a geek show with no intentions of trying to live up to the class of the original.I could go on and on with the flaws. A huge hospital with mostly dark corridors and seemingly only one patient in the whole place? A weakened character able to squeeze off two pinpoint shots hitting someone in each eye? The silly and not very original ""connection"" between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. It goes on and on.Still ""Halloween 2"" has a few good moments. I liked the recap of the original's ending to open this film with Donald Pleasance telling a neighbor ""You don't know what death is"". Also the presence of Michael Myers is truly creepy and very effective.The biggest disappointment is that ""Halloween"" is a classic horror film that, sadly, spawned hundreds of imitators that were all worse then the one before. ""Halloween 2"" proved it was no better then any of the other imitators.",Halloween II
236,Phantasm01,Evil Never Dies,9,2 August 2006,"""Halloween II"" picks up right where the first film left off, with Michael Myers pumped full of bullets courtesy of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence). But while he may be down, he's anything but out, and has followed Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital where she's receiving treatment for her injuries. Haunting the hospital's deserted hallways, Myers makes use of medical equipment on whomever he finds in ways that the AMA certainly wouldn't approve. While Laurie tries to evade her would be killer, Dr. Loomis obsessively hunts Myers, leading to a fiery conclusion.Taking over for director John Carpenter, Rick Rosenthal (who would return to the franchise more than 20 years later with ""Halloween: Resurrection"") lacks the style that made the original ""Halloween"" so memorable. Nevertheless there are some scary and gruesome incidents as Michael dispatches of the hospital staff in his search for Laurie. In fact, the sequel is a bit gorier than its predecessor, adding more to the shock value quotient. Rosenthal also uses POV shots as effectively as Carpenter did, adding to the illusion that we're seeing events through Myers' eyes. Rosenthal also knows how to use shadows and darkness, making things seem scarier than they are. Must mention the ""Camera Angels"" are once again CLASSIC.The script by John Carpenter and Debra Hill essentially gives us more of the same. The setting is changed to a hospital, and it's revealed that Laurie is Michael's sister, but little else is added to the night Myers came home. As for the concept that Michael Myers is possessed by the Celtic Lord of the Dead - that innovative concept is mentioned, but never really explored. Which is kind of for the best.Plenty of care was put into the character of Michael Myers. He's shown to be not just an insane killer, as he avoids killing an elderly couple and walks the streets of Haddonfield trying to look innocuous. Myers is shown to be quite intelligent, coming across as a man with a mission. This added trait makes him stand out from the pack of lunatic imitators, and sets him up as an Classic Horror Icon.Jaime Lee Curtis is fair as Laurie Strode, but she shows none of the spirit she had in the original, and mainly looks like she's having some sort of out of body experience. Lance Guest does a good job as her would-be boyfriend, projecting sensitivity and compassion that makes him a likable character. Too bad he dies by slipping on a pool of blood and hitting his head; But it's Donald Pleasence, as Dr. Loomis, who steals the film. Pleasence has the right blend of desperation, single-mindedness and fear that makes him the centerpiece player in the franchise. You can even feel his commanding presence even when Loomis is off screen.The second ""Halloween"" film, while not quite as good as the first, It comes pretty close, and is still a very entertaining entry. More importantly, it sets up ideas that come into play in future sequels. Overall, ""Halloween 2"" is a scary and effective treat, and the final classic of the ""Halloween Franchise"".",Halloween II
237,BenTramerLives78,The Nightmare Isn't Over,10,24 October 2020,"Halloween 2 is a nearly perfect sequel. It takes place on the same night as the first 'Halloween' although it was filmed three years later. The atmosphere is nearly identical although there is another actor portraying the Shape. This time, Dick Warlock is wearing the mask. He doesn't move the same as Nick Castle, the actor who donned the mask in the original, but he's still good nonetheless. The kills are more intense as this was filmed at the height of the slasher era. 1981 was actually the year that most of the popular films of that sub genre were released.Donald Pleasance is still great as Dr. Loomis. Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode is now in the hospital and Michael Myers is trying to finish what he started in regards to Laurie.I really like the hospital setting. It would be easy for 'Halloween 2' to be boring or a ""dumb sequel"" to a classic movie, but in my opinion, it's a great sequel and one of the best in film history.",Halloween II
238,alexscott-35299,An okay sequel!,6,29 October 2021,"This film is okay, but just okay. It's a little boring to be honest, it's basically the same as the first one but just worse because it's so repetitive. Honestly there's not much to say at all about this film, it's fine yeah but it's just not really necessary, it's a very forgettable film. Like I jsut watched this and I've already forgot the whole film apart from the ending. Speaking of the ending, it is the best part of the whole film. It's a very well shot and well done end do the film and honestly this is where the series should have ended, but no they had to drag it on forever and now we're stuck with a series of films that will never be better than the first one. Not necessary but not bad!",Halloween II
239,hotrobinproductions,"No... just no, Halloween 2018 is better",7,6 January 2020,"I don't get the recognition this film gets. The only thing it has going for it is the atmosphere... but even then that's robed from the film before it. The hospital setting also is pretty spooky, the kills are badass, and the effects work as well as the music, and I can admit the opening crawl is pretty dope. With all that the movie just fails, the script is awful, the actors are so boring even Lee Curtis is boring. She sits the entire movie moping around. I get it, she just went through a terrible thing. She has no story or motive other than sitting around, the movie literally relies on that movie before it to tell her story here. It's just terrible and she goes underutilized. The only character with something to work with is Loomis and this has been the case ever since they made these dumb sequels. The sister/brother plot twist changes nothing of the story, literally if you take that out of the movie it changes nothing. It only gives the movie excuses to make more sequels down the road completely stripping away from what makes the original better.",Halloween II
240,Kirollos-Noah,"Mediocre, yet disappointing!",5,22 October 2019,"Happy Halloween, and welcome to my review of the sequel to the amazing 1978 Halloween, the sequel that didn't live up to its predecessor at all, and tried to make sense to somethings that already didn't need any explanations at all!Halloween II isn't directed anymore by John Carpenter, this time it's directed by Rick Rosenthal, and written by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, same writers of the original. And starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence and Dick Warlock as The Shape.Halloween II picks up where its predecessor left off, Laurie Strode is taken to the Haddonfield Hospital for observation, while Dr. Sam Loomis continues his desperate search for his monstrous patient. After slashing his way through the townHalloween 1978 is my favorite Halloween movie, it's a must-see each Halloween, and of course it influenced and inspired lots of other slasher movies, and even the low-budget filmmakers too.So when the first one ended I was confused, did that movie really needed a sequel, or it just should have ended right there? And the answer was no, til the 2018 Halloween movie came out, which I really loved, and I reviewed it, if you're interested go and check it out.Back to the 1981 sequel, Halloween II unfortunately didn't live-up to any of my expectations, it took a way that changed and explained the first one, which was so unnecessary, killing for no motive at all was always creepier than having a motive to kill for, not always working though, but in the case of Michael Myers, it was better with no motivation, because if he was trying to kill Laurie because of THAT reason, then why did he kill the others? It will make you question the first one a lot, and that what a sequel shouldn't do! A sequel should follow the steps which the first one made, but Halloween II didn't, and that's my biggest issues with the movie!The movie also left some questions unanswered, like Myers going to a school, writing a word on the board with blood, and it leaves Loomis to explain to us what does that mean, and that what Loomis was in this movie, mostly going ""I shot him 6 times and he didn't die!"" or explaining some supernatural stuff, which is disappointing, because he was my favorite character in the original, but we don't get cool scenes like the scene where he explained how does it look like in The Shape's eyes, we don't get that from him anymore!The Shape is still cool and creepy, he has like a truly final fight where where he was fighting Loomis and Laurie, and I think it was cool, but the sound effect though.. not that great!Laurie, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, is so bland in this movie, I found her, with all those updates, so uninteresting, her character in this movie is just all about staying in hospital until Myers arrives and then running away, it was only that moment when Loomis told her the truth about Myers and that was it!Still, you could find somethings to enjoy, the movie is still creepy, amazing atmosphere, we get an amazing scene where The Shape was moving in the street all in blood, but it's Halloween so no one cared, The Shape is still amazing, the score is haunting, and the some sequences were fun, but the structure wasn't well-handled, they took all the wrong steps and built a movie about it, yeah it explained a little, but messed up a lot, so it's a flaw more than a pro.The movie is still well-shot, Rosenthal did a great job filming this movie, and building a good atmosphere, and didn't mess up The Shape as some of the other sequels did.Halloween II is not a terrible sequel, actually it's better than some of the other horror movies sequels in that era, but it fails to follow the original and it took a terrible turn, and with some unnecessary twists, so it fails to be a good movie, and that was disappointing!I'm gonna give Halloween II a C.Happy Halloween, guys, it's getting close, I'll be reviewing a lot of horror and Halloween movies a lot til the end of October, so stick right here if you liked this review! And as always thank you for reading my review.",Halloween II
241,waynehorrorshow,Great sequel,8,29 October 2018,This one is a must to watch if you liked the first one this is more tence than the first and keeps the great horror series thriving . Grab a pillow,Halloween II
242,waynehorrorshow,Tence part 2 worth the watch,8,8 May 2019,"Great tence film, great part 2 that bring the story forward and gives you the creeps well worth the watch, have 6 pillows in hand 🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪",Halloween II
243,Dandy_Desmond,A strong follow up to a classic,8,15 August 2010,"following a classic movie is always a tall order. Halloween 2 makes a good attempt at doing the first movie again with a little more gore, more deaths and more action. However it does have its problems along the way. The movie picks up the moment the first film ends, which i thought was good but some people think it should have been set a few years after as Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance look clearly older. Laurie Strode is moved to the hospital where we are introduced to the skeleton staff working there overnight. Michael finds out Laurie is there and proceeds to enter the hospital, stalk and eventually kill everyone inside. The setting with the dark,silent eerie corridors is great, I also liked the hospital staff as the script gives you time to get to know them before they are dispatched in a number of grizzly ways. The actor playing 'the shape' is also very good at taking Nick Castles mannerisms and there is also a coldness in his eyes through the mask that is quite unsettling. The only thing I don't like is the whole sister link. John Carpenter confessed to doing this after having a six pack and trying to think of something new to add to the story. I don't like this thread throughout the movies. What was great about the first film was he picked on Laurie simply because she came to the Myers house - there was no reason or logic - he was just a weirdo. The film however is suspenseful, has good characters, is stronger in a violent way than the original and has a terrific ending. Its a strong sequel to a horror classic and I would recommend.",Halloween II
244,CalDexter,Excellent 'conclusive' sequel to the classic chiller,7,18 March 2004,"Halloween II continues exactly where the first film concluded. After Michael Myers was shot by Dr. Sam Loomis he simply disappeared, but here hes very much on the loose and butchers an attractive young lady called Alice just down the road from the Doyle residence.Meanwhile Laurie Strode is taken to Haddonfield Hospital unaware that the mad killer (now a zombie who won't die) is still after her blood.This sequel is actually an excellent 'Volume 2' companion next to John Carpenter's original classic. The budget is much bigger, the murders and gory moments are more graphic and Michael Myers is more of a quiet rampaging monster rather than the ghostly 'shape' before. Carpenter's music score has been given more of a catchy remix by Alan Howarth and a dose of 'Electronic Realization' whenever Myers murders somebody.The nurses in this movie are all very attractive, special mention must go to Pamela Susan Shoop for her spectacular performance as Nurse Karen with Leo Rossi in the Hospital Therapy Room. When she drops her white towel to reveal a gorgeous figure, Halloween II becomes a near Masterpiece because you know these lovers are going to be murdered. We've seen Shoop's fantastic breasts so we are also going to see her gruesome death and gruesome it most certainly is. Michael Myers drowns her head in the scalding Therapy pool, in what must be the most horrifying scene in the entire movie before ruthlessly dumping her body to the side like disgusting garbage.Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis are as good as ever, the final showdown between Myers, Loomis and Curtis should really have been the perfect demise for the shape, but Halloween producers sensing a dollar to be made brought him back in the lamentable Halloween 4.The ending of this film is terrific. I love it when Michael Myers gets shot in the eyes by Laurie and starts lashing around the Hospital operating theatre while there's this beating background music playing like someone's heartbeat, when Dr. Loomis turns on numerous gas cannisters that beating gets louder and louder until Laurie makes good her escape and Loomis blows himself up alongside his zombie monster patient.With gruesome gory mainstream horror than the more art-house original, Rick Rosenthal's Halloween II is the best sequel (and original conclusion) to the Halloween story. Seven out of Ten.",Halloween II
245,henrymadman,Not As Good As The First But Still Good,9,7 June 2007,This film starts off where the first left off which is a good idea but as it goes on the story fades off a bit and virtually the film is about Michael killing nearly every thing that moves. But there are snip-its in the film where it explains a bit more about what the film is actually about. Personly I think that the filmmakers of the Halloween series should have just left it alone after Halloween II because...Halloween III Hasn't even got Michael in it at all.Halloween IV Is about a little girl getting possessed by Michael.Halloween V Is kind of the sequel to number IV.Halloween VI Is actually alright because you find out why Michael kills.Halloween H2O Is meant to be a straight sequel to Number II.Halloween VIII Is when Michael kills Laurie but still kills people???Halloween IX Is a remake of the first! What was Robert Zombie thinking!,Halloween II
246,onnanob2,Lacks the style and atmosphere of the original.,6,22 November 2002,"""Halloween II"" picks up during the same night of terror where the original ""Halloween"" left off. Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) has just shot Michael Myers several times, and Michael's main victim, Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), is cowering against a wall. Michael Myers survived being shot and the fall from the balcony, and has vanished from where he landed on the ground. Loomis meets with the sheriff (Charles Cyphers) to let him know Michael is still on the loose, and Laurie is taken to the hospital. Michael Myers learns Laurie has been taken to the town's hospital from a radio report, and crosses the town to continue his attempts to murder her. In the meantime, the police continue to look for Michael. A nurse from the first ""Halloween"" (Nancy Stephens) shows up with a marshal to transport Loomis back to the psychiatric hospital where Michael escaped. Possible SPOILERS: Michael arrives at the hospital in search of Laurie, and kills anyone he comes in contact with. Laurie seems aware that Michael will be coming after her again, and tries to get away from the area. Eventually Michael does find Laurie, and chases after her. Dr. Loomis learns Laurie is actually Michael's younger sister, and by gunpoint orders the marshal to drive them to the hospital. ""Halloween II"" lacks the style and atmosphere of the original film. This is not to say there isn't any atmosphere at all in ""Halloween II,"" because there is mood and atmosphere in spots. The sound of police and ambulance sirens passing through the town add a nice touch, and so do the empty, barely lit hospital corridors. However, it does not seem logical that a hospital would have barely lit corridors! It also does not seem logical a hospital of its size would have such a small night staff. Also illogical is the fact that it seems the hospital's only other patients besides Laurie are a group of newborn babies. Well, there is the one totally exploitive, drop-in emergency patient: A little boy who had gotten a razorblade jammed in his mouth while eating a Halloween treat. The film contains illogical matters such as a cat leaping (more like thrown) out of a trash dumpster where it had been trapped, and a nurse totally ignoring her job to have a nude romp with an ambulance attendant in the therapy room's hot tub. ""Halloween II"" delves into more exploitation than the first film, and the murders are bloodier, gorier, and more graphic. The addition of graphic murders, extra profanity, and more nudity drags ""Halloween II"" down style-wise, and the film's style just doesn't match up to the first ""Halloween."" There seemed to be a desire to have a high body count with this film, which is very much unlike the first film. Michael Myers used only large carving knives in the original, and in this film he uses a variety of instruments to murder. A higher and bloodier body count and the changing of murder implements may have come about due to the slasher genre being in full swing back in 1981, but these changes really diminish the feel, style and atmosphere from the first ""Halloween."" -In this case, excess did more harm than good. The acting in ""Halloween II"" is fine. The film does contain some thrills, chills and suspense, and it does have its share of mood lighting. John Carpenter's simple but classic score is repeated in a more intense manner, which seems to be fitting for this sequel. Michael Myers seemed to be after Laurie because she came the closest to his boyhood home in the first ""Halloween."" He seemed obsessed to stalk her and the people she was in contact with that night. In ""Halloween II"" it is learned Laurie is Michael's younger sister, which is the explanation for his murderous pursuit...A plot twist I never cared for. The end result: ""Halloween II"" lacks the style and atmosphere of the original ""Halloween"" and it is a mediocre film, but it still makes a seasonable choice for a Halloween horror film line-up.",Halloween II

Hospital can be a great horror setpiece, but they just didn't use it to it's full potential.It's a conclusion that we did not need, but we got anyway. It's not perfect, and it's certainly not the worst Halloween movie ever made, far from it.As said in the title, after all - it's a cashgrab, but one that included most of the folks that worked on the first one, John Carpenter included.

250,benjaminwest-242,A disappointing sequel,4,30 October 2021,"Halloween II is a decent attempt at keeping the franchise alive, but has too many flaws to be considered a good film. There is more violence, which assists in holding up the place of Myers' dementedness and scary nature. However, this may be the only upside throughout. There is an almost complete lack of character development in the entire film, and for what is developed, it is ultimately worthless. The ""surprise twist"" has no logic, additionally, with its irrelevance to the plot being easily apparent if you give any thought to it. It is more clearly pointed to that Myers is supernatural, but in still being brushed over, the idea becomes a downfall. In turn, most of the plot is poorly written, likely due to the confinement of a feature length movie to the setting of one night. The storyline at times becomes simply unrealistic. The dialogue is not convincing either, and as a result the acting follows, where no cast member has enough screen time to shine. Overall, the film fails in nearly every way.",Halloween II
251,veryape-887-913905,More of the night he came home,9,29 January 2014,"Proving John Carpenter's maxim that ""You can't kill the boogie man"", the second instalment in the blockbusting Halloween series picks up from where the first left off. It is still Halloween night 1978 and despite Dr. Loomis' best efforts, Michael Myers is still at large in the sleepy town of Haddonfield. Having failed to kill Laurie Strode, the seemingly indestructible Michael Myers follows her to the Haddonfield Clinic, where she has been sent to recover from her injuries. Michael then continues his his murderous spree until he finally confronts Laurie and we learn the horrifying truth behind his motives. First time director Rick Rosenthal seriously ups the gore and body count in this 1981 sequel that was scripted and produced by John Carpenter and Debra Hill. Originally intended to be the final part of the Halloween series. Halloween 2 stands alone as a worthy contribution to the slasher genre, but clearly serves as the perfect companion piece to the original movie: watch them both back-to-back and relive the the complete terror of the night he came home.This film stars: Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence & Lance GuestThis film was a very good sequel and it is not easy to live up to the 1978 classic Halloween. Halloween is one of my favourite films and Halloween 2 is one of my favourite sequels. Further sequels did get stupid after this one and I can only name 2 good sequels out the remaining 6 after this one. I do recommend this to you slasher fans out there, if you want to watch the other ones go ahead but you probably will be disappointed like I was, however this is my opinion so don't get annoyed at me if you are a fan of 3,4,5,6,7,8.****/***** Very Good film",Halloween II
252,gothic_a666,Mostly Mediocre,3,21 April 2009,"A sequel always have a lot to answer for and the greater the original movie the more disappointing a follow up is likely to be. This first ""Halloween"" sequel is no exception. It breaks no ground and simply tries to give a sense of continuity to the classic boxed in a much less ambitious format.The result is an average B movie that on its own is not utterly without merit but that cannot possibly live up to the originality of ""Halloween"". However, unlike it happens in later entries to the franchise that deteriorate the fundamental elements and twist them beyond recognition ""Halloween II"" is grounded in the universe of Michael Myres. The chronological linkage that places the action just a few hours after the events of the first movie adds to this cohesiveness within the mythos as do several technical details- the first perspective shooting employed early in the movie is the best example of this- that quote ""Halloween"" in a rather literal way. In terms of atmosphere the setting of an ill lit and mostly abandoned hospital is canonical as far as horror goes and it does work in creating a hunting ground for a stalking boogieman. The death scenes are also interesting enough and the narrative culminates in a climax that is prefaced by a clever scene in which the use of sound is on what everything hinges. However, there are many faults in ""Halloween II"". The continuity glitches are such that are noticeable even by an average viewer, character-wise there is hardly any development, the plot moves along by numbers and very often takes too many liberties. But perhaps the most harmful element in this movie is the pseudo Celtic nonsense that is added with the purpose of explaining just what Michael Myres is, an attempt that fails on all levels and that was dismissed by fans as it was accessory and unnecessary. Ultimately, ""Halloween II"" lowers the standards of the first movie, what in good in it are the references to Carpenter's work- from the intro to Myres' mask- and what brings it down are the innovations it tries to introduce in the canonical universe by explaining Myres' existence as well as its being so much humble in all areas, be it in terms of scope, cinematography and relevance.",Halloween II

255,kira02bit,A let down after the original,4,25 October 2018,"With the wild success of the 1978s Halloween (which spawned an army of imitators), it seemed a given that there would be a sequel, especially given the chilling open-ended climax of the original. This film picks up where the original concludes with survivor Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) being carted off to the hospital, while Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) sets off in dogged pursuit of the recently shot Michael Myers. Unfortunately, the return of some of the cast and the basic premise are about all this mediocre sequel have in common with its precursor.Whereas Halloween was dripping with atmosphere, suspense and eschewed excessive violence, the sequel dispenses with all that and seems more akin to the increasingly tiresome gorefests that proliferated in its aftermath. John Carpenter's stylish direction is in short supply here. Instead of those marvelous shots of Myers lurking in the background unknown to his potential victims, Myers more often than not just lumbers into frame with a weapon of choice and attacks in a repellent fashion. In the earlier film, Myers mostly strangled his victims and resorted to a knife later in the film. In this, he seems to alternate various weapons (hammer, hypodermic needle, scalpel, scalding water) for no reason other than to sate the bloodlust of Fangoria readers everywhere. You know where the film's priorities lie when we must endure close-ups the blood tests done on Curtis when she enters the hospital.Setting the action at a hospital would seem inspired, except the film's depiction of a hospital is laughable. Halloween is probably one of the busier nights at a hospital (think of all the drinking and accidents from pranks), but the drugged Curtis literally seems to be the only patient in the entire hospital, which makes one wonder why it takes Myers so long to track her down. The staff of the entire hospital seems to be about 7-8 people who are picked off throughout the night with nobody ostensibly knowing. I worked in a hospital and I can tell you if the people on your shift disappear and leave you to do all the heavy lifting, you notice fast. The fact that no one notices is absurd.Given that Curtis was just attacked, the lack of police presence is baffling, as is the fact that no one can seem to locate her partying parents even well into the wee hours. In a small town, wouldn't the news of a killing spree have spread like fire? Similarly, when the last standing of the staff start to think something is awry, the whole ""the phones don't work"" is ridiculous, as is when Tawny Moyer's nurse leaves to get help and finds that every car in the parking lot has its tires slashed.The film's big ""twists"" seem foolish. We never understand the purpose of why Loomis' supervisors would want to pull a man who knows Myers so well back out of the field (or why nurse Nancy Stephens from the original would be the one sent to yank his leash with a trooper in tow and know more about Myers' background than his own doctor). Myers' break-in at a closed school where he writes ""Sanhain"" on the chalkboard in blood makes no sense. And the grand twist of Myers familial relation to Laurie actually makes his pursuit of her less scary. I find it far more creepy that he is pursuing her merely because she is the one that got away.The cast is actually pretty decent for something like this. Pleasence is still in top form as Loomis. Curtis has a pretty thankless role this time. She spends three-quarters of the film in a drugged stupor and largely off screen. Then rather unbelievably rallies for the climax to ramble groggily around the hospital just out of Myers reach until she miraculously shoots him in the eyes with sharpshooter precision. Um, right! Of the endless array of possible victims, one can find pre-Falcon Crest diva Ana Alicia and pre-Last Starfighter Lance Guest. Guest and Moyer are actually pretty good. Pamela Susan Shoop shows up as a buxom nurse who gets to bare all in a heated tryst in a hot tub before being boiled to death - although in fairness the film does at least get her male counterpart Leo Rossi to bare his well-muscled backside as well.Aside from the overemphasis on gratuitous violence this time, the film also has little logic and a great deal of stupidity. The possible low point is when Guest stumbles across a body drained of blood and literally slips in it and bashes his head on the floor never to be seen again. Did he die? Is he just unconscious? The film could care less about its characters (at least the theatrical version, since an extended TV print does reveal him alive and sharing an ambulance away from the hospital with Curtis at the climax). The end result just seems like a plodding workmanlike follow-up to a classic.",Halloween II
256,TheMichaelMyersMovieFanatic,I Really Like This One!,8,25 March 2020,"I remember when I watched this for the first time. I had purchased it for own money and invited my friends over to watch it. I remember screaming at some scenes as well. Halloween II is a fun sequel that will please most Halloween fans, but it's not perfect. Many of the characters are underdeveloped making some parts of the film boring. I don't find the hospital setting that scary at all and I would rather watch Michael stalking trick or treaters on the streets, even though some scenes with Michael walking down corridors are creepy. But by far the most common negative when people talk about Halloween II is the fact that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is asleep for almost the entire movie. When you have the perfect final girl you don't just have her sleeping through the first two acts of your movie!There are negatives, but I love Halloween II because of the suspense and atmosphere. I'll give it a 7/10.",Halloween II

The screenplay of the final scene of the original is rehashed in this movie and the scene is different and contradicts the final scene which is just silly and careless.2. The shape looks like hes shrunk six inches and just looks too different from the original, obviously the previous actors could not return for some reason, but this is clearly noticeable.3. jamie lee curtis wig, it looks like shes stopped at the barbers on the way to the hospital.4. The secluded hospital is too contrived and not believable , hospitals usually have more than 20 people dwelling inside it , why not do a rewrite were michael sneaks around a real hospital without his mask occasionally ? this would have brought more suspense to the movie.5. the shamain subplot that reveals michael myers is cursed and thats the reason hes invincible !!!! , this idea should have been shelved takes the mystery away from the character too soon.These errors were easy to avoid.But the continuation of that night was always going to be interesting , the murders are more grotesque and maccabre and the eerie atmosphere matches the original film but the execution is poor because of the obvious flaws .
The franchise should have stopped here they made part 3 without michael myers to make a series of haloween stories??? Then bring him back in part 4 when in this movie myers and loomis obviously died.
Then theres part 5 and 6 which goes too far regarding the curse plot , then they disregard 2, 4, 5, 6 , with two more follow ups to the original h20 (1998) and haloween (2018) uh ????
The original movie in my opinion is the greatest horror film of all time and ill take this sequel as a worthy conclusion and disregard the other movies- including haloween (2018 ) the franchise has been tired since this original sequel wrapped .",Halloween II
258,Jesse-45,Michael enters the sequels!!!,10,31 August 1999,"This is almost as good as the original movie. But it spent too much time in the hospital. But this is good entertainment. I think Halloween III should have followed this entry. It would have been awesome. This is standard slasher cinema, with Michael Myers on the prowl, in Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, taking out nurses, left out right, while he searches for his second sister, Laurie  (who later changed her name to Karie Tate in Halloween H2O, so Mikey would never find her again.) Dr. Loomis sets Mikey up in flames. Mikey goes into a coma for 10 years, but he returns for more bloody rampage in Halloween 4.",Halloween II
259,PlayerSS,Better than the first movie,10,27 September 2003,"Taking place the same night. This one is a little better in my opinion. Dick Warlock really brought out some characteristics of Michael for the sequels. He moved a lot slower as Michael than Castle did. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is where the nurse finds the dead doctor. Out of the darkness behind her Michael's mask slowly fades in. That was a cool lighting effect. Jamie Lee Curtis returns and so does Pleasance. The story was great for a sequel. Some of the highlights have to be the deaths of the movie. Halloween 2 seems a lot more violent than the original and it it works well for this movie. Michael is a lot more p*ssed in this one. The bulk of the movie takes place in the hospital. Which is were the bad things about the movie happen. The ending killed off Michael for good. There is no way he could come back from what happened to him in the hospital. Since Halloween 3 bombed, Dimension had no choice but to bring back the money making Myers. A great movie with an ending that should have been avoided.",Halloween II
260,eytand94,Halloween II: A Sequel to Scream About,9,12 November 2011,"The first ""Halloween"" is a genuine classic. In 1981, capitalizing on such a frightening movie's success with a sequel was probably the farthest thing from John Carpenter and Debra Hill's mind. If they were to ever make a sequel, they wouldn't just do it for the money. They'd do it to build on the original's story and to keep Michael Myers scary. Carpenter and Hill sat down to write a script about where The Shape would be now and how he would continue his reign of terror. The end result was ""Halloween II,"" and surprise, surprise! It's a sequel that rocks! The film begins right where the first film left off. It's October 31st, 1978. Laurie Strode has had a horrific ordeal after an escaped madman attacked her. She is sent to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital to have her wounds treated while Dr. Sam Loomis wanders the streets looking for Michael Myers. We then transition into the hospital to check up on Laurie. What she doesn't know is that The Shape is not dead, and has followed her to the hospital. He roams the hallways, searching every room for his target. Anybody who gets in the way will suffer the consequences.Ordinarily, when people think of sequels, they stay away. They want more than just blood, guts, and naked women hitting the chopping block. They're smarter than that. Luckily, ""Halloween II"" doesn't treat its audience like idiots. It respects the original, and keeps its atmospheric and frightening tone. However, it IS a sequel, and when you're making a horror movie in 1981, you have to give the audience what they want to see. There is much more violence and gore in this film than there was in the first. But it goes to show you that Michael Myers is more intimidating. And for those who enjoy their horror movies with a bit of nudity, ""Halloween II"" satisfies.While the first ""Halloween"" was fairly limited in its setting(it was set in Illinois, but took place mostly in just two houses, which were The Shape's stalking grounds), part 2 expands its environment. We get to see how Michael's murders affect the town of Haddonfield overall. Reporters flock the Wallace and Doyle houses hoping to catch a glimpse of a body. A pack of high school kids cause a riot at the abandoned Myers house, breaking bottles and getting drunk. These events don't go quietly in this town, and they're not just a random occurrence.There is still a great amount of mystery to Michael Myers. We never truly know what he looks like without the mask, and his super-human strength is still quite shocking. He keeps playing his deadly games with his victims before they die, especially in that iconic scene in the therapy room. The twist on why The Shape is after Laurie always stuns the viewer the first time they watch the film, and although it provides more motivation for Michael to kill than in the first film, it still leaves you questioning why he is that way.Another cast of sympathetic and talented leads elevates ""Halloween II"" over your average slasher sequel. Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis return as Sam Loomis and Laurie Strode, and both are once again fantastic. Then we get some new faces. Lance Guest is entertaining as Jimmy, a friend of Laurie's who works at the hospital. Other great performances include Pamela Susan Shoop as Karen(an actress with a great rack), Gloria Gifford as Mrs. Alves, Tawny Moyer as Jill, and Leo Rossi as the obnoxious Bud.With Carpenter and Hill only writing the script, the director's chair was filled by newcomer Rick Rozenthal. Of course, he's no John Carpenter, but he understands what made the first ""Halloween"" so amazing. He keeps the tension high and stays true to keeping all settings darkened. Rozenthal does a fine job as the director.If the film has any flaws, it's that Jamie Lee Curtis's hair is noticeable as a wig, and Carpenter's music, with some assistance from Alan Howarth, is more 80's and not as simplistically disturbing as the original 1978 score. But otherwise, I enjoyed ""Halloween II"" thoroughly. With it, and the 8 films that followed, the Michael Myers mythology stays alive, and is plenty scary. This sequel carves deep, like a knife penetrating a smiling pumpkin.",Halloween II
261,GluStick,The Boogieman IS back with a vengeance!,8,6 June 1999,"The best horror sequel. Considering that there's hardly no worthy horror sequels. I like this movie because it picks up exactly where the first one stopped. It offers a great amount of suspense and some funny lines but overall the script is poorly written. It has great shock sequences and the part in the beginning with the girl on the phone is a big shocker. I didn't like how Jamie Lee Curtis was so catatonic in this movie but I probably would have acted the same way if I found my friends dead and was being stalked by a maniac. This a really great sequel and I doesn't really get much credit which is strange because it's almost as good as the first and the fact that most horror sequels suck. I just wish the script was better written, better actors were used and they used Nick Castle and the original mask. It looks puggy. Halloween II: B+",Halloween II
262,pleiades10,Good follow up.,7,23 October 2000,"Halloween 2 continues the story line abruptly ended in the original. Laurie Strode (Curtis) ends up in the hospital due to trauma and injury from the earlier film's attacks by Michael Myers. Unfortunately for her, Michael finds her. The hospital is oddly deserted, but that adds to the creepy atmosphere, allowing Michael numerous places to hide, and various nurses to slaughter. Donald Pleasence reprises his role as Dr.Loomis, trying to stay one step ahead of Myers killing spree. The  showdown between the killer and the doctor remains a very gripping sequence. All in all, a very worthy follow up to a classic that can never be duplicated.",Halloween II
263,badfeelinganger,The film is best if watched back-to-back with the first.,10,24 September 2014,"The film is best if watched back-to-back with the first. This kill-happy sequel is a lot bloodier than needed, but it's still pretty frightening nevertheless. completes the story. More than 30 years later and the debate about whether Rick Rosenthal's sequel to John Carpenter's horror classic Halloween is really any good, continues. On one hand, much like the troubles that befell the sequel to Jaws, Halloween II was met with its fair share of flaws and frustrations. A great many deaths were later re-shot by Carpenter himself to pump up the gore. And even some character moments were lost on the cutting room floor. So, in a sense, Rick Rosenthal's Halloween II is more like a hybrid cut, with some added gore cut in to make the film more ""horrifying.""But is Halloween II a good film? Well, that's the debatable part. It plays fine when stacked right against the original film, playing more like a continuation of the first feature.Halloween II is the sequel we got, and it does have a few solid moments of gore, and a few scares, it's a masterful followup fans would have hoped for.",Halloween II
264,watto124,Not what I'd call a first-rate picture.,7,4 September 2000,"Halloween was all about atmosphere and suspense. When you add CRAPPY music, blood and guts and  stupidness you get a crappy movie. But, however the film does deliver enough plot twists and scares to make you reconsider. Dr. Loomis delivers a couple of memorable lines. By the time the movie is half way through, you'll be thinking Hey! This Movie Sucks! But, by the end, you'll think it's good due partly in fact to my favorite addition to the movie, ""Mr. Sandman"". Now thats John Carpenter at his best!",Halloween II
265,RyanEberhart,Awesome!,10,3 November 2013,"Halloween II picks up right where the first movie left off. Of course, it wouldn't be much of a sequel if Michael Myers (Dick Warlock) was really killed by Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence). Dr. Loomis shot Michael six times and Michael fell of the second story balcony of the Doyle House. However, when Dr. Loomis runs downstairs to investigate Michael is gone.John Carpenter and Debra Hill wrote a great sequel. They continue their use of lighting tricks and psychological tricks to keep the terror going. John Carpenter and Debra Hill almost single handedly jump started the horror genre.Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital to get treatment of her injuries. Michael Myers finds out where Laurie is and makes his way to the hospital. Somehow he gets inside.I love this whole series, not so much the third one, but for most part the whole series. There are plenty of scenes I like that others like just as much.The first scene I like is when Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest) walks into a minor surgery room to get Mrs. Alves (Gloria Gifford), the head nurse. Jimmy doesn't notice the red liquid on the floor under Mrs. Alves until he see the needle and hose sticking out of Mrs. Alves's arm. He quickly stands up to leave the room, but slips on what turns out to be blood, and is knocked unconscious.The second scene I like is when Michael finds Laurie. Laurie runs, as best she can on a fractured ankle, from Michael. She makes her way down a set of stairs into the basement, Michael follows. Laurie gets cornered, but sees a window that leads into another section of the basement and she climbs through just as Michael gets to her. Laurie gets to the elevator and the doors close just as Michael reaches them.The third scene I liked was when Dr. Loomis and Laurie are pursued into an operating room by Michael. Michael stabs Loomis with a scalpel, but doesn't kill him. Laurie takes the gun that Loomis gave her and shoots Michael, apparently, in both eyes. Loomis opens the compressed tanks, pure oxygen and ether, and uses a lighter to ignite the gas. Fortunately, Laurie has escaped, but witnesses Michael walk out of the surgical room engulfed in flames. He falls to the ground, again, apparently dead.Some other great scenes are when it is discovered that Michael had been to the elementary school and he stabbed the sister of a drawing of a family. Michael also wrote the word ""Samhain"" on the chalk board in blood. Dr. Loomis explains that ""Samhain"" is the Gaelic festival marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter or the ""dark half"" of the year. Samhain is celebrated between sunset on October 31 to sunset on November 1. In Halloween II it is explained that Samhain is also the Druid God of Death.Or when Annie Brackett (Nancy Kyes), Lynda van der Klok (P.J. Soles) and Bob Simms (John Michael Graham) are taken out of the Wallace house. Annie's father, Sheriff Lee Brackett (Charles Cyphers), pulls back the sheet covering her face. Before going home to tell his wife their daughter is dead, Sheriff Brackett berates Dr. Loomis for letting Michael escape in the first place.Also in Halloween II we find out that Laurie Strode and Michael Myers are brother and sister. Laurie was born two years before Michael killed his older sister, Judith Myers (portrayed by Sandy Johnson in Halloween). A few years after Michael killed Judith, Laurie's birth parents were killed in a car accident and she was adopted by the Strode family.I give Halloween II 10 stars out of 10. If they haven't been already, I declare that the first two movies of the Halloween Franchise are classics. They are pure psychological thrillers. John Carpenter and Debra Hill wrote perhaps the two best Horror/Thriller movies of the last 35 years. Carpenter and Hill take what Alfred Hitchcock did during his career and expanded on his psychological genius.",Halloween II
266,jerralagbayani,Slow but steady.,6,25 October 2018,"Creating a sequel after a smash hit has a lot of pressure on your hands. Will it be good? Will critics or the public agree? What made the first film good? This film isn't as good as the first but is still not bad.Taking place in the same night as the first, Michael is on the hunt again, this time targeting a hospital where Laurie Strode is being taken in after a wound.This film has a semi-fast pace and has a greater kill count. It's a typical sequel. But this film was a powerhouse, there was more to be found and there was nothing stopping Sam Loomis and Michael Myers to getting to their destination as soon as possible. And the tone kept you guessing when he'd come back, especially because it is almost constantly dark.The negative side of this film is that it's kinda boring. The sequences for Loomis and Myers were at times too long and we needed a break from getting too deep into finding each other.Quick review, decent film, cool tones.Moderate nudity(for a bathtub scene), gore, and brief language",Halloween II
267,ADOZER200,Another one of my worthy sequels,8,23 January 2003,"This is another sequel i felt was a really good one. It continues off where the first Halloween ends. Ofcourse nothing is better than the whole neighborhood scenes at the begginning of the movie. Micheal Myerss face look a bit different in this one. He looked so angry like somebody somebody had poked him in the neck with a needle, poked him in the eye with a clothes hanger, stabbed him in the chest, shot him 6(or 7)times and got thrown off of a balcony. Plus it looks as if he loses a couple pounds. Above all the difference it is a very worthy sequel. Any one who has not seen Halloween 2 should go out and rent it. If youre a hardcore horror movie buff and you love the Halloween series you should be missing this one.",Halloween II
268,brianlion,I Don't Think Michael Myers Is Done Yet,9,19 October 2002,"This is the sister movie of the original, and it is great for many reasons. It is not halloween season officially until my family and I bundle up on the couch, turn the lights down low, and watch this movie. The acting is bad, but the soundtrack music is the best and reappears throughout the movie. Some of the erie background music seeps into a scene like a creepy crawler, and adds to the tension of the movie.  There is something compelling about watching one of the all time great villians, slowly stalking his victims. Before there was Jason or Freddie Kruger or Chuckie, there was the original slasher, Michael Myers.  Yes, Jamie Lee Curtis looks a little less naiive and child-like, and part 2 has more sex scenes.  But it's like watching a car wreck.  You just can't turn away. What ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is to the Christmas season, ""Halloween"" I and II are to the Halloween season.  Just don't turn the lights down too low.",Halloween II
269,brianlion,"WHEN THE DIRECTOR YELLS ""CUT!"" HE REALLY MEANS IT",9,11 November 2002,"This is a great companion to the original ""Halloween"". It completes the story, and adds to the Michael Myers legend. We have made these two movies a part of our annual Halloween experience. Yes, some of the acting is not very good, but maybe that is one more reason we love this movie.  The theme song is great, and really builds the tension. We certainly wouldn't take our sick dog to this hospital or its staff, but that just adds to the fun. Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't quite retain the naiive, fresh look she had from part one, but Michael Myers looks as sinister as ever. His slow walk with that big knife and expressionless face, as he stalks his prey is classic. Donald Pleasance is great and keeps the movie together. The final scene in the small room with the oxygen tanks is a fitting climax to the film. Other ""Halloween"" films have come out, but they do not come close to the cult status of the original, or its sister movie. To me, it is sad that Michael Myers did not die with ""Halloween II"". Later versions had Michael Myers walking very quickly at his victims, they changed his facial make-up, and had scenes where he stabbed repeatedly. I always say, if you are going to ""kill people"" in the movies. atleast do it right. Do not ""over-kill"" as they say. But, ""Halloween II"" got it right, and it joins the original ""Halloween"" as a cult classic.",Halloween II
270,MissCzarChasm,It's a Decent follow-up but doesn't come close to the Brilliance of the original,7,30 April 2002,"Halloween 2 was a nice try to follow up a slasher classic. I know that it was made because the first film made a nice amount of money but for some reason I can just tell they tried to keep it on par with the original. In some aspects they succeed but in the end we get a routine horror sequel. I guess it's unfair to expect so much out of it but when you're the follow up to a well made horror film it's pretty hard not to.The main problem with this sequel is that it moves entirely too slow and the one location it stays in(the hospital) gets boring pretty fast. As Michael slowly stalks the halls we get the feeling that the film is also moving at the same pace. Another problem is that it follows the slasher routine by adding characters that are just there to be victims for our killer. The characters in the first film were likable and were pretty developed, even if you knew they all wouldn't make it to the last frame. In this film we get total brain-dead characters who are just asking to be taken out by Myers. The only new character worth mentioning is the character of Jimmy played by Lance Guest. He gives a decent performance and is the only ne character added to the mix worth mentioning.One issue that most Halloween fans debate about is whether or not The Shape, as he is commonly called, needed a backstory. I admit that in the first film is total lack of a motive made him much more frightening because it wasn't reason that was driving him to kill, it was just the fact that he was pure evil. In this film the reason he is after Laurie is revealed and it does kinda strip that aspect of the character and make him less scary. However, for story purposes for this sequel, it would be pretty hard to have a 90 minute film and not explain anything about its killer. For this film in particular i appreciate the fact that they added a method to his madness, it just brings down his fright level a few notches. At least the explanation is well-crafted and comes as some sort of a surprise.A definite highlight of the film is that it picks up on the same night of the original. It added a level of suspense and consistency that made the story in the sequel much more interesting.Donald Pleasance gets more screentime in this film and you can tell he is having fun with the role. He's quite good in this film and maintains the same dignity that made his character likable in the original. Jamie Lee Curtis gets less screentime in this film. She's still good in this film but more of her would've been appreciated. I also wish we could've seen more of the strong powerhouse that we saw in the original but she is still effective in her scenes. Michael Myers himself is given more screentime something i wish would not have been doen. He was a far more threatening presence when he was reduced to the shadows and the background throughout most of the original. More of him makes him less scary.In the end it's a fairly good sequel to the original i just wish it could've stayed away from the 80's slasher mantality that made Friday the 13th so popular. However when the essence of the original shines through in this film you begin to think it's a cut above its many imitators",Halloween II

272,HORROR_FAN_1,A good crack at a sequel,7,26 April 2002,"I suppose it was always going to be difficult for John Carpenter to write a sequel to match the excellent original 'Halloween', but he doesn't do a bad job in 'Halloween II'. What makes this sequel work is the basic fact that nearly all of the original cast is back, including the 'scream queen' herself Jamie Lee Curtis and of course, the legendary Donald Pleasence.Pleasence then went on to make the IV, V, and VI sequels in which he was completely wasted, but without him, I think those other sequels would have been simply laughable. The ending of this movie is impressive and you kinda find it hard to believe that Michael is going to come back, as well as Dr. Loomis for 'Halloween IV' after been that severly burnt in the explosion!.Not as good as the original but that is usually to be expected with sequels. A watchable film nonetheless that carries on the Michael Myers saga impressively.Rating 7/10.",Halloween II

274,headfulofghosts126,Yawn...,2,29 August 2002,"The sequel to Halloween is probably one of the most horribly paced movies I have ever seen. In a word: boring. That's what it is. This film CRAWLS. The atmosphere is drab, the soundtrack is droning, and the characters are so laid back that there is absolutely no sense of danger or hysteria. It feels like the movie is three hours long. Throw in some really illogical murders, a lot of bad acting, and a very anticlimactic ending and you've got one of the worst slasher movies I've ever sat through. What's amazing is that they only get worse from here. I truly don't understand the appeal of this series. The first one was creepy and well executed. Being written by the creator (John Carpenter), I find it hard to believe this is the best they can do. Our `main' character Laurie Strode is reduced to being bed-ridden most of the film and spurting out a few sentence fragments here and there. The rest of the cast is either under developed or totally unlikeable. There is no one to root for. Instead, we're subjected to Michael Myers murdering arbitrary characters without any suspense. This is where we get introduced to Michael as this killing machine that is `not a man, he's pure evil!' It kind of takes away from the character in my opinion. The first one worked because we didn't know his motive. All we knew was he was some mental patient that was hacking up baby-sitters. That wasn't soooo far fetched. This is where the series really start pushing the limits of reality. Once you do that, you seriously start reducing the level of fear. This is not Aliens or The Thing where it's an alien being whose unknown origin/capabilities are terrifying. This is a serial killera slasher. A film that's only scary if it takes place in the world we recognize and live in. Halloween II however, begins the transformation of Michael Myers the cold blooded killer into Michael Myers the cartoon. Not only is this movie not very scary, it's simply not entertaining. It is a chore to sit through. While not my absolute least favorite in the series, it's still way below average.",Halloween II
275,arturopanduro,A fine sequel,8,21 November 2001,"""Halloween II"" picks up exactly where ""Halloween"" ended, which is a well-admired aspect as far as sequels go. Michael Myers continues his pursuit of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). In this sequel, we discover the reason for his stalking her in particular. Most of the film takes place at Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, where Laurie is admitted. Very entertaining and quite creepy at times, ""Halloween II"" delivers all the goods. There is even some comic relief, thanks to some of the hospital staff. The best of the six ""Halloween"" sequels to date.",Halloween II

Myers walks out of the room on fire, takes a few steps and falls, he burns up to a crisp, the Dr. dies in the fire and only Lori Strode makes it out alive, in the TV version, Lance Guest also makes it out alive, but not in the theatre version. The last thing we see is the fire engulfing the mask, the night he came home is over. Next HALLOWEEN 3: SEASON OF THE WITCH, why? Because Micheal Myers is dead, gone burned up, not a person anymore, so how could they make more Myers films, if so shouldn't he be blind and burned? Did the film makers overlook HALLOWEEN 2? Just stick to the first two, they make sense, they are the best, and if you have to see a sequil, see H2O it followes the real story line, sort of.

It picks up precisely where the first ""Halloween"" had left off, which tremendously set hope and a good light on the second installment right off the bat.This one also takes place in the hospital in which Laurie Strode is being kept, provides a revelation on the Myers family and how Michael and Laurie are connected.I think the only thing that I found wrong with this film was the ""Mr. Sandman"" music playing the beginning and the end. I mean, come on... that's about the most random music for a horror movie... most especially a ""Halloween"" installment. I found it quite ridiculous and stupid.

Halloween II is a good sequel, the suspense is there but not quite like the first one. John's classic halloween theme is still haunting even though it is synth based and not a real piano. Performances are the same. The thing that makes the original so much better is the writing and directing. The imagery of the first one is much scarier. Michael standing by the bushes still sends chills up my spine. The lighting and cinematography of the original was really done well. An example of this, would be Laurie falling down the stairs as the camera follows. Which this sequel and all the sequels lack. John did not write and direct the sequels and thats why they fall short. Them giving Michael a motive took away the point of the ""The Shape"". The shape is evil and has no motive. In 1978's Halloween, there was no reason to kill the people he did. Making Laurie his sister was a mistake that even John himself admits. I am still a fan of just about every Halloween movie but none compare to the first. The point of Michael was you can't kill evil and not all evil committed has a motive or reason. A solid sequel that just lacks in writing and terror like the first.",Halloween II

It is a direct continuation of the first movie and the unstoppable and seemingly immortal murderer Michael Myers is still chasing his sister, the poor Laurie, while followed by Dr. Loomis, who is fulled with grim determination to stop the maniac. The movie is predictable and not very original, but still very entertaining. Michael Myers is really scary, the murders are hideous, but not too gory and Donald Pleasance is excellent and very convincing as Dr. Loomis. in conclusion: a must for horror fans.",Halloween II
282,chez-3,A major blown opportunity,5,17 February 1999,"If there's one film I wish could be taken back and done all over it's ""Halloween II."" How could they blow it? They had a classic film as their blueprint. What went wrong?The film opens with the ending of the original and, for the first twenty minutes, promises to be a good sequel. Then with Michael Myers' help it goes down the drain. You see, Michael had a method to his madness in the first film. The people he stalked he stalked for a reason. Here he kills at random like Jason or Freddy and the horror is gone. We know the routine by heart. The victim will hear a noise and be frightened by something other than the killer and then whammo! the killer strikes. We saw that hundreds of times before this film so ""Halloween II"" becomes just another slasher film.Carpenter was able to scare us in scenes of daylight in the original. Here, Rosenthal is given a completely night time setting and can't deliver. And what was the deal with the gratuitous violence? Needles in the eye? A hammer in the forehead? Death by scalding? I couldn't believe it. The original film had no real violence - it was all horror. Here it's all violence and no horror.If only someone had taken a closer look and re-written the script. This film had potential to be a classic sequel to a classic original. Instead it's a pale sidekick to all the ripoffs of ""Halloween.""",Halloween II

From behind?Imagine doing this. You're in a quiet place. A serial killer is on the loose. Your friend is obviously on edge because you can hear them tentatively calling out. You decide the best way to let them know that you, their friend, is right beside them and that they are safe is to creep up behind them and tap them on the shoulder.You wouldn't. Unless you're a sadist. Imagine that.

284,foxhound-37781,An ok sequel but lacks originality....,6,2 April 2021,"Halloween 2 is actually not bad as far as sequels go. It starts literally right where the first film finishes, following Michael Myers escaping into the darkness of Haddonfield's streets and alley ways, continuing his murderous rampage. The time of night this film begins is roughly 11pm.The aftermath of the first film is shown nicely after Laurie Strode is being taken to hospital to be treated for her injuries, as well as Sherriff Brackett finding out about his daughters death. Dr Loomis is still hanging around trying to work with police to catch Myers taking the blame from everyone around him.Majority of Halloween 2 takes place in the hospital, and it's here that Laurie finally finds out who the killer is and only because she's told by one of the paramedics... long story short, Myers finds out Laurie has been taken to the hospital, makes his way there to try and get her. Problem with this hospital is it's so empty. Like seriously is Laurie Strode literally the only patient in this entire hospital apart from the kid we see who has a mouth injury? You can't expect us to believe that there are only two nurses to run this entire hospital? We only see one doctor as well. There's no way a real life hospital could operate with just one doctor and 2 nurses and.....All in all, Halloween 2 isn't bad and you could watch both movies back to back as one long horror movie which is a pretty cool idea if you've got nothing else to do on a Saturday night, but don't watch this one expecting it to match the masterpiece that is the original =P.",Halloween II
285,timefreezer7,Worthy and satisfactory sequel,9,4 October 2001,"For once more it is extremely frustrating to read all those negative comments that this is a lame and trashy movie . Unfortunately the facistic philosophy of "" original = good    ,   sequel = garbage  "" is inherent in 99% of the reviews from both critics and the audience . WHAT 'S THE MATTER WITH YOU PEOPLE ???  Film history has already proved us that if the materials are used properly and the reconstruction is done carefully , a sequel can top the original even by miles ( examples like Superman II , Karate Kid II and of course the untoppable James Cameron's Aliens come to mind ) . Although Halloween II doesn 't actually manage to surpass its predecessor it belongs to a strange category of sequels that have their own special charms and are ""on a par"" with the original (just like Gremlins 2 ). Keep in mind that it was written by John Carpenter and Debra Hill themselves , the creators of this story . Why are you being so negative ? Can 't you realise that it is the second chapter of the whole story ?Personally I find brilliant the idea of picking up (LITERALLY) where the first movie left off . ( I cannot recall not even one sequel that did that ) It gives a very realistic touch to this hopelessly rediculous and farfetched story (don 't get me wrong , I like Halloween but it is ridiculous) . On top of that there are many reporters and TV bulletins which cover the incidents and the Hadonfield habitants now know that there is a psychopath killer loose on the streets . The realistic atmosphere gains more points . Moreover the basic set is now a hospital which is definately frightening . I have read comments saying ""How stupid : where are the patients ? "" , well it is a local hospital what do you expect ?Probably the best scenes are the ones with Laurie ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) roaming in the dark corridors with the creepy music increasing the delusional scary atmosphere . Many viewers have said that she her character is not developped !!!! We already know her from the previous movie so know we see her struggling to survive from the clutches of the deranged Michael Myers . The story is so powerful with the 3 characters returning that when I saw it I was breathless . As for Donald Pleasance as Dr Loomis , well .... he is passable doing more of the same . His dialogue hasn 't developped much : He is pure evil blah blah blah he is not human yadda yadda yadda . Many have complained about the much gore and high body count . Well keep in mind is that Michael is more p***ed off now . What did you want ? The daytime stalking scenes of the original Halloween ? Not only it cannot be done but it would be kind of repetitive . I found quite interesting the ""Samhain"" subplot which unfolds some of the secrets of the celtic paganistic background the story is based on . The revelations continue in the next sequels .I have read all those ironic comments "" Why doesn 't he speed up one step to kill Laurie ? DAAAAH !!! "" Well Michael had precisely the same pace as before . So why are you whining now ? because it is the sequel ? Halloween II is a very decent and enjoyable effort and it worths a look .********HUGE SPOILER : DON 'T READ UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE FILM******* For those who found the plot 's secret lame and unwitting I will have to inform you that there are deleted scenes from Halloween . In one of them Dr Loomis walks into the room of Michael Myers and sees something written on the wall : the last thing the maniac Myers wrote before he escaped was the word ""SISTER"" . It was preplanned all along . ************************************************************************For anyone mildly interested in horror films this is must see . Give it a shot and ignore the stupid comments like "" MAN , that Halloween night of 1978 must have lasted 24 hours ! "" If you watch carefully the 2 films you see that the time frame is adequate . 8 / 10",Halloween II

287,jpasols,One of the better sequels to come out of this series!,10,30 June 2018,While I love ALL of the Halloween films I personally think that this here is one of the very best most underrated of the Halloween sequels.

289,zofos,A Cut Above The Rest,8,17 June 2009,"To paraphrase Simon Cowell, ""Halloween II"" is a Marmite movie – you either love it or hate it. I fall into the former category. I saw ""Halloween II"" before I saw the original ""Halloween"" and I guess it kind of ruined the first movie for me, because so much more happens in the sequel. The first movie takes a long time to get going, characters have to be set up and a lot of stalking happens before Michael Myers strikes for the first time. The sequel doesn't have to do any of that and takes off right from the ending of ""Halloween."" John Carpenter turned down the chance to direct this sequel, but he co-wrote it, produced it and did the excellent synthesized score with Alan Howarth (the start of a long and successful collaboration between them.) Rick Rosenthal was chosen to helm the sequel, but Carpenter came back later to direct some additional scenes that added more gore to the movie. (Carpenter was criticized for this but slasher films had become gorier in the three years since the first film and he was responding to the market. Also, Michael Myers can't spend a long time stalking his victims anymore. Doctor Loomis and the police know he's on the loose in Haddonfield when this film starts and he's wounded and, like a wounded animal, at his most dangerous. That's why his kill count quadruples here. So it is a logical progression.)Dean Cundey, the great cinematographer whose atmospheric, prowling camera-work added so much to the first movie, thankfully also came back for this movie. Without him, there would not have been the same feeling of menace throughout.In the first Halloween movie, we find out that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has a crush on a boy called Ben Tramer and wants to go to the Prom with him. Well, as if having all her friends murdered by The Shape and barely surviving herself isn't bad enough, she also has the added trauma of Ben Tramer being flattened by a police car in this movie and bursting into flames against a van! As Laurie is drugged up and in shock in the hospital, she would have only discovered what had happened to Ben after she'd recovered from it all. Another kick in the guts for poor Laurie.People have always wondered why the hospital that Laurie is taken to, Haddonfield Memorial, is so deserted. That could easily have been addressed by Carpenter when he wrote the script. I've always figured that the hospital in ""Halloween II"" was a lot like the police station in ""Assault on Precinct 13"" in that it was closing down and about to be re-located somewhere else. Laurie just happened to arrive on its last night in operation with a skeleton crew.It's easy to see what movies John Carpenter was watching when he was writing ""Halloween II""; 1. ALIEN (1979): In 1974. John Carpenter co-wrote ""Dark Star"" with Dan O'Bannon. It was a comedy about how an alien gets on board a spaceship and creates havoc. O'Bannon subsequently recycled that plot as a horror movie in the screenplay for ""Alien."" It clearly had a big impact on Carpenter. ""Halloween II"" is essentially a re-working of ""Alien"" with a hospital replacing the spaceship, The Shape standing in for the Xenomorph and nurses and paramedics substituted for the blue-collar space crew. In ""Halloween II"" one of the female characters berates a male colleague for swearing, just as in ""Alien."" ""Alien"" influenced Carpenter so much that his next movie was a remake of ""The Thing"" in 1982.2. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980): The big twist in the sequel to Star Wars was the shocking revelation that Darth Vader is actually Luke Skywalker's father. Carpenter tries the same trick with ""Halloween II,"" by making Laurie Strode the sister of Michael Myers. Again, Carpenter was criticized for this plot twist, but, again, it's quite logical. If Myers stalked his victims in the first film at random, why would he go to all the trouble of coming after Laurie again at the hospital? The sister twist is the reason.3. Dracula (1979): ""Dracula"" concludes with Van Helsing (Laurence Olivier) being impaled by Dracula (Frank Langella) with one of his own stakes, but, as he dies, he makes sure that he defeats the vampire by sticking a hook in his back and having him hoisted into the sunlight where he disintegrates. ""Halloween II"" ends in a similar way with Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) being stabbed in the stomach by Michael Myers with a scalpel, but, as he dies (or so we thought at the time), he turns on the gas in the operating theater of the hospital and blows himself and his patient Michael Myers to smithereens. Even though nobody could have survived such an enormous explosion, box office demanded that both Loomis and Myers lived and they returned for ""Halloween 4"" in 1988 (just as well, as it was a pretty good film that wouldn't have been the same without the great Donald Pleasence.) I like ""Halloween II."" It was made during that golden period in John Carpenter's career between 1976 with ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and ending in 1982 with the critically-mauled but now-loved ""The Thing."" After that, Carpenter's heart didn't seem to be in it. There were flashes of the old master in ""They Live"" in 1988 and ""Vampires"" in 1997, but he was never the same director after the critics tore him apart for making ""The Thing."" The great thing is, we still have his movies from that golden period to watch and enjoy. ""Halloween II"" is a regular in my DVD player around October 31st and always will be. If Rob Zombie's ""Halloween II"" is even half as good, I'll be happy.",Halloween II

With the second, it just picks up right where 1 left off and holds it till the end.

295,Arlis,"Better than part 1 because it's a real slasher, not just a psychological thriller.",9,7 November 2006,"I decided I should watch these again and refresh my memory oh how great they are and then come here and talk about them. I reviewed part 1 and I think I have made a few Halloween fans mad as I talked about how it wasn't as great as what it was cracked up to be. I love part one but it was not scary nor was there a lot of killings. It was a bit dry and bored me at times.Part 2 is a straight up slasher with lots of killings and a few scary scenes. It was a couple years after the first one and slasher movies were a dime a dozen by this time, but we slasher fans loved part 2 of Halloween because it took what so many of the slashers had evolved to and made one of the better slashers of the decade. It had become a cult fave because of the success of the first one and it had no problem quickly getting recognition.It takes off right where part one ended and that was interesting. It was cool because when you watch the two back to back you cant even tell that they were filmed a few years apart. I loved it and just like Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers shows us here that he is not one to mess with and he will kill anyone who gets in his way.I've heard so many people put it down and saying that Halloween should've been left alone and no sequels should have been made. I think though and I believe this 100 percent that if there had been no sequels that Michael Myers would not have been a household name and although part one would've lived on, it would not have been anywhere near as successful as it is now. The whole realm of horror and especially slashers would have been so much different and crappy without part 2 being made. It showed that a sequel can be successful and it helped movies such as Friday THE 13TH, SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and such by showing them that no one wants to see them die in the first one  we want sequels forever. I love slashers and although many are bad still it's better than going to the theatre and seeing another damn Tom Cruise, George Clooney or Julie Roberts crappy blockbuster reigning supreme. Horror has almost taken over Hollywood and I couldn't be happier to see it. I will admit though that back in the day horrors were a dime a dozen, but only the good stuff made it to theatre - nowadays anything makes it. Companies like Miramax and Lionsgate are tossing out so many its crazy and they all seem to become pretty successful.I think many of these should go straight to video and quit going to theatres and making people see them  it's giving horror a bad name. 99 percent of remakes suck ass and sequels are carbon copies of all that came before. Love seeing horror in the box office but hate seeing crap and knowing that no one even tries anymore. Anyone with a camera and/or a computer can make a horror movie and any movie company will buy it and everyone will watch it. What has happened to us people? Sequels are great, but give us a motive, give us a reason. Do not make these movies about someone coming back and killing more people; give me a reason why they had to come back. Halloween has done that better than anyone.Remakes should focus on movies that need a remake, stuff that has been forgotten, not classics. Why remake stuff like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, HALLOWEEN, PSYCHO, EVIL DEAD, and THE OMEN? We love those movies and everyone has seen the originals and loves them. Movies like Psycho, which was almost an exact copy of the original  stupid waste of time.I want Originality and I want some talent and well written horror movies.

Carpenter didn't direct this one but produced it and wrote the screenplay. First-time director Rick Rosenthal did a fairly good job trying to imitate Carpenter's point-of-view shot from the original. The body count is way higher than in any of the first installments of the Halloween series but there is less suspense. The idea of continuing exactly where the first one stopped (actually it starts even earlier showing again what happened at the end of the first one) was a great move by the film-makers.Laurie is being brought to the local hospital with Michael Myers following her to finish his work. The hospital staff soon gets reduced before Michael tries to kill Laurie as well. At the end Michael Myers and Donald Pleasance seem to die in a gas explosion and we see Michael's body burning to ashes.But both Michael and Dr. Loomis reappear in Halloween 4 (after that great film called ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"") what shows that Michael ""The Shape"" Myers isn't the only tough guy around (although he lasted one sequel longer than Loomis).There are certainly better ways of getting rid of your money but if you're interested in slasher films you might like it.My rating: 6/10 (after this one, skip #3, go straight to #4)",Halloween II
298,kayrannells,"Entertaining, But Not As Scary As the Original",7,13 October 2020,"Opening where the last film left off, a now-crazed Dr. Loomis discovers that his insane, escaped patient, Michael Myers, has just survived 6 gun shots and a fall from a 2nd story balcony and has just walked off into the night as if he was just grazed with a paintball. Dr. Loomis goes off in search of him before he can kill again and Laurie Strode, the last film's sole survivor, is transported to the local hospital where she's immediately sedated so that when Michael Myers does find her, she'll be acting like the recent recipient of a lobotomy.What doesn't work about Halloween II is that it's not a film about Laurie Strode or Dr. Loomis. It's a film about Michael. It becomes all about his goal which is to kill his sister. The original film was at its scariest when it was centering on its relatable and authentic high school babysitters and their own minor, seemingly insignificant high school problems. Halloween II gives us hearty ensemble of new, sometimes colorful characters, but doesn't seem very interested in them on anything but a surface level, so you're only choice is relating to Michael Myers.

It sounds sleazy on the part of the producers (I mean Halloween cost 600,000 to produce and sold to NBC-TV for 4 million--everybody got paid except for Carpenter and company who needed the job) . . . anyway despite the obvious set pieces, the neighborhood looks like it was built on a studio back-lot, Halloween 2 is the same (the score sounds a little over-produced--but it IS HALLOWEEN II-sequel, BIGGER, BETTER: STEREO too). the performances are the same. and there's genuine continuity--the car accident (again, not a spoiler, no details) has connections to the first movie . . . its like Halloween were a freight-train and Halloween 2 extended the ride by another hour and a half and mass-culture got bored . . . I love Halloween and Halloween 2 collectively. but they rip off the Italians: Deep Red, Twitch of the Death Nerve, Blood Spattered Bride, Hatchet for a Honeymoon . . . right down to the face melting scene but whereas the needle through the eye is bloodless in Halloween 2 the meat-cleaver butchering in Deep Red has blood going everywhere.",Halloween II
300,sunshinebeachcinema,"A bit more over the top than the first film, but a decent enough slasher sequel.",8,30 May 2014,"Halloween II (1981) Halloween II hits the ground running and throws us back into the action right where the first film left off to deal with the fallout of what's just happened: masked serial killer Michael Myers is still on the loose and the injured Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is rushed to hospital as psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) desperately searches the streets of Haddonfield, Illinois for the murderer.Creators John Carpenter and Debra Hill returned to write, and the new director, Rick Rosenthal (who would later direct further Halloween sequels) deliberately strove for continuity by emulating much of Carpenter's style. Carpenter even re-shot some of the movie himself.Like many sequels, it doesn't have quite the freshness of the original, and it's worth remembering that this film came after a few of the spiritual successors of Halloween (1978) had already been released, such as Friday the 13th (1980).There's less of the understated menace of the original; where the first film kept to the shadows, the sequel shows more explicit gore and violence. Whether this is simply a reflection of the larger budget facilitating better makeup effects, or a pandering to the new slasher demographic is unclear.The hospital setting is a fairly common horror movie location, whether a psychiatric hospital, ground zero for a zombie outbreak, or the lair of a mad scientist. It's even revisited in later Halloween movies. It's not a bad choice, but it's unoriginal compared to the previous film's deconstruction of idyllic suburbia. Hospitals can be creepy with little creative effort, naturally playing on our fears of injury and mortality, and providing Michael with more inventive weapons such as syringes and intravenous drips.Here, Haddonfield Memorial Hospital is almost deserted, evoking post- apocalyptic abandonment. The stalking of empty corridors also calls to mind admittedly superior horror movies such as The Shining (1980) which was released the previous year.Aside from Laurie, the only other patient we see is a young trick-or- treater in the Emergency Room. He has a razor blade lodged in his mouth, an early excuse for some wince-inducing gore which reminds us that it's still Halloween night and plays on the unsettling urban legend of dangerous objects hidden in Halloween confectionery.The ludicrously small night staff number just one doctor, one security guard, two paramedics, and three nurses. This cast become the new set of victims for Michael. Unlike many slasher films, they are not hedonistic teenagers, and based on their jobs, they should be intelligent and responsible members of the community.They do demonstrate typical horror movie naivety: the security guard is bumbling, the doctor is a drunk (and his disappearance symbolises the removal of any competent authority from the setting). Some of their behaviour; a nurse and a paramedic slacking off and having sex in a therapeutic hot tub for example, is exactly the kind of reckless teenage abandonment which draws a serial killer in this kind of film. Sure enough, Michael is right around the corner to deliver some post-coital homicide.Even though Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence are back, their characters don't have a huge amount to do. This is a shame as their characters and performances are among the best in the series. While all the above has been happening, Laurie's been lying helplessly under sedation, and Dr. Loomis has been running around town with the sheriff following red herrings.Pleasence does get to give some passionate speeches on the supernatural origins of Halloween, which are suggested to be the source of Michael's near-immortality. The other revelation ties this in with Michael's bloodline; these themes would be explored in later, inferior sequels.Lack of our heroes is rectified in the final act when Loomis arrives at the hospital. Laurie's on the run, and everything thing goes down as you might expect, although the final fight has some unexpected elements. Dr. Loomis's act of self sacrifice seems fairly conclusive, but the eight other films in the franchise suggest otherwise.Trivia: Dana Carvey appears in this film as an extra. He would later team up with a different Michael Myers in Wayne's World (1992) playing Garth.",Halloween II
301,Horror_Metal,A great sequel that is nearly as good as the original!,10,4 October 2013,"After soulless killer Michael Myers (Dick Warlock) left a trail of bodies throughout his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, sole survivor Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is rushed to the hospital to be treated for her injuries. Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) tried to stop Michael by shooting him six times, but the masked maniac escaped and immediately resumed his merciless killing spree. He soon arrives at the hospital where Laurie is staying, and begins butchering anyone who crosses his path while searching for his target. Dr. Loomis, who finds out that Laurie is actually Michael's long lost sister, quickly realizes that Michael must be trying to finish what he started several years ago when he killed his older sister Judith. Dr. Loomis quickly travels to the hospital, which is now the site of a grisly massacre. He plans on ending Michael's reign of terror once and for all! But how can you stop someone who seems to be indestructible? This sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece Halloween has more action, more gore, and even a couple of explosions. That doesn't quite make it better than its predecessor, though it comes close to being almost just as good. I always loved this movie and found it to be a great and immensely entertaining followup to one of the best horror films of all time. Michael Myers, played excellently by Dick Warlock, isn't nearly as mysterious or scary as he was in the previous film, but here is way more violent and brutal. It seems he is tired of wasting time and will stop at nothing to find and kill Laurie, played by Jamie Lee Curtis who gives a great performance just like before. Donald Pleasence excels once again as the now obsessive Dr. Loomis, who seems to be losing his mind and, by the end of the film, may have grown just as insane as Michael. I love the claustrophobic setting of this movie, as the darkly lit halls of the hospital make for some truly creepy atmosphere. Add to all that an epic and explosive finale, and you have Halloween II. If you're a fan of the original, check this amusing sequel out right away. You won't be disappointed!",Halloween II
302,nickzbekool,This is how you do a sequel!,10,15 August 2020,"Picking up right where the 1978 classic left over we get to see more of the night he came home! Laurie played by JLC is taken to a mostly abandoned hospital where Michael is waiting and working his way to her. What works so well is the superb cast but also the atmosphere to me hospitals are very eerie and this movie makes the most of this creepy setting. Out of all the Halloween sequels this stands out a lot. Scary, suspenseful and a killer ending! One thing people may not like is the gore element since the original was virtually bloodless in comparison but to me it does not deter the films power. Michael is back and the body count rises. Perfect sequel in every way and only adds to the legacy of this classic film series.",Halloween II
303,shuz,"If you like horror, this will be sure to please...",8,22 April 1999,"This to me was an excellent sequel to a classic of the genre.  It is the most basic of horror movies, but it has the eery creepiness factor the first one had.  The best part was how it started from the minute the first one ended, making it more believable.  Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is now at the hospital and all drugged up, making it hard for her to get anywhere very quickly.  The death scenes are inventive to this day, although you will have seen a lot of copycat scenes in more recent movies.  If you can get past Jamie Lee's horrible wig, you will be entertained.",Halloween II
304,Ride-3,Good Continuation,10,13 April 1999,"Halloween II is a great sequel to John Carpenter's original horror classic Halloween.  The neat thing is, Halloween II begins exactly where Halloween ended.  Michael Myers escapes and Laurie Strode is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital for treatment of her wounds.  After hearing that Laurie was taken to the hospital on a radio, Myers sets out for the hospital. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis is frantically searching for the fiendish mass murderer.  The surprising, fiery climax makes your heart pound and screams escape from your throat.Halloween II is Rated R for graphic gory violence, adult language, brief drug use, mild sexuality, and for nudity.",Halloween II
305,Kaliyugaforkix,"Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream....",5,2 June 2011,"What is it about Michael Myers that creeps me out? There's a bunch of other horror icons to choose from; Myers is runner-up when it comes to real heavies like Freddy Krueger and Jason Vorhees. Certainly he was one of the first movie-maniacs for many, though not mine (that cherry pop went to momma's boy Jason Vorhees) but that isn't quite it either. Was it the mask? Breathe a sigh of relief that John Carpenter chose the modified captain Kirk look instead of his original choice of clown regalia, it's a lot stranger and striking. Maybe it was his simple yet brilliant goose bump score (which unfortunately is given the full synth treatment here, one of its biggest faults) combined with the Shape's heavy breathing, or Myer's silent implacability and steady stride that always seems to outpace his victims even if they're racing in the opposite direction.Or it could've been his passionless approach to the craft; Freddy and to a lesser extent Jason visibly got off on their murder, making them maybe more accessible. Michael Myers is completely alien, a man-child garbed in a grey mechanic's jump suit, never better than when implementing that old slasher stand-by, the butcher knife. Even when he's playing his ghost sheet prank in number 1 -the rare moment where you get the sense The Shape is digging his new gig- it still feels distinct, not like the sadistic thrill shared by those other monsters. Maybe I'll never pin down exactly what it is that makes Michael Myers for me the scariest of the crop, even among more showy contemporaries like Leatherface and that bastard son of a hundred maniacs, but every time I watch HALLOWEEN (discard superfluous sequels 4, 5,6 & 8 & remakes) I never cease to get creeped out. Not since TERMINATOR has such single-mindedness to annihilate a lone victim been so frightening. The same kind of robotic feedback loop seems to animate the Shape ever onward towards his prey. The fabulous final frames are no less startling: Jaime Lee stares dead-eyed into the camera, her mind replaying Michael's consumption by fire in the vacant hospital as closing music, an old chestnut (""Mr.Sandman"" by the Chordettes) juxtaposes brilliantly with her vivid recall of the movie's climax, that damned mask melting as a blazing inferno engulfs his face over a jaunty tune. It inverts the innocent tune it into something horrible- its very haunting. Understated, indelible, it points better than anything towards why Keri Tate of H2O is such a broken human being.A decent sequel.",Halloween II
306,drewdo-37060,It's okay,7,3 August 2019,"This movie was written by John Carpenter after studios insisted he write it so every day he'd sit down with a six-pack and just wrote till he passed out. And man does it show. It's just the same things with a nearly unconscious Jamie Lee Curtis throughout the whole movie, dumb character choices, poor acting, and just the same thing as the original. I did like how it takes place right after the last one ended and I do like Ben Tramer's kill. I also liked the slightly changed theme and it's good. But I don't prefer it too much.",Halloween II
307,davidt-73859,I shot him 6 times,7,31 October 2020,"This opens with the final scene of the original and then picks up right where they left off. After being shot ""6 times"" he seems unharmed and is back on the move. The kills are slightly better in this one using some weapons instead of just choking everyone and a much higher body count. Being a continuation of the first it moves so much quicker and is far less boring. Laurie also puts up a much better ""final girl"" fight in this.",Halloween II
308,RebelXStar,I've been Trick or Treated to death tonight,6,15 November 2015,"Poor Laurie Strode just can't catch a break. Mere hours after being attacked by escaped mental patient Michael Myers, he follows her to Haddonfield Memorial where she is being treated for her injuries and continues his murderous pursuit of her. But not before he has hacked his way through the staff of the (frankly, understaffed) hospital.And as always, Dr. Loomis is never too far behind trying to figure out Michael's next move.As far as horror sequels go this one is okay. As mentioned above it is a continuation of the same night in the previous movie, and it does a decent job of picking up where it left off in spite of some glaring continuity errors that make it obvious it's the early 80's and not 1978 like it's supposed to be.Halloween II does exactly what horror sequels are supposed to do; up the ante and raise the stakes. It relies more on blood and gore than the first one ever did (Friday the 13th was released in between the first movie and this one and as much as I loathe the Friday the 13th movies, the influence is there), and reveals more about the connection between the characters. In the first movie we are led to believe that Michael's fixation on Laurie is entirely random, but Halloween II reveals that she is actually Michael's long lost sister. Some say that this reveal makes the events of the first movie scarier, others say that it ruins it completely. It's up to you which category you fall into.Donald Pleasance once again brings the sense of foreboding and dread as Dr. Loomis. Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't have much to do as she is confined to a bed for much of the movie and when Michael catches up to Laurie, the chase scene is just a re-tread of the chase from the first movie but in a hospital setting, though she does a good job at being the likable damsel in distress in what screen time she is given.",Halloween II
309,gardnernrg,The Shape Returns,6,27 October 2020,"This film picks up right where the original left off, even showing the end of the first. And in many ways this film does compliment the first. They go hand in hand, with Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis delivering powerful performances. The kills are better and more creative in Michael's second go around. But that is about it. This movie seems to have so much more filler stuff in it than the original did, and it just puts a damper on the whole movie as we have fast paced scenes followed immediately by 10 minutes of Loomis searching the town. Not a bad sequel, as sequels usually don't turn out too well. And, considering what the rest of the Halloween franchise brings, this is good.",Halloween II
310,Old70115,WHY IS HE STILL AFTER POOR LAURIE STRODE,8,22 June 2004,John Carpenter and Debra Hill wrote this screenplay.  Per JOhn Carpenter he was involved because he wanted the money. HE wanted some control and that is why he produced this as well. This movie was directed by Rick Rosenthal. After Rick Rosenthal turned in his cut of Halloween 2 John Carpenter did some re-shoots and added more gore! The first murder in this movie is rumored to be one of these.  The movie itself is still very good. No its not as good as the first one however it does keep you interested. Now on the plus side we FIND OUT WHY Michael is after Laurie. Now if your lucky to catch this on TV it might not be the same version on VHS/DVD. There is several scenes added or extended! There is even a new ending!   If Universal ever released a DVD with deleted scenes I will be the first to buy!,Halloween II

312,cny_cd,Decent sequel that is true to the original.....,7,27 January 2010,"This was the first (of many) sequels to the classic ""Halloween"", picking up exactly where the first film left off. All of the key characters have returned, and of course Michael is still on his ""Halloween rampage"". A good portion of the film takes place in and around the hospital that Laurie was sent to after her ordeal earlier Halloween night, and that makes for some spooky scenes, but overall this doesn't have quite the punch that the original film had (sequels seldom do). Overall, its a good companion to the first film, and probably should have been the final film in the series, but we all know how that went.........",Halloween II
313,mojo-15,"Produced in a rush, a waste...",4,4 September 2000,"I think we can all agree HALLOWEEN was probably the best horror/slasher picture ever created.  A sequel only seemed appropriate, right?  And some of them, I must say, are quite enjoyable (4 and 7), but, sorry folks, this isn't one of them.  The Cons: Producers hurriedly whipped out a new script and started shooting a second after the smash success of number 1.  But wait a minute, this is not what HALLOWEEN was all about.  It didn't have stomach churning gore, like this one, or plotless killings, like this one.  Part II is explicitly bloody (the syringe murders, and the whirl-pool murder), and all of that isn't needed.  I thought HALLOWEEN proved moviegoers world wide this exact point: gore does not equal terror.  It's not only this, though, the plot is weak and only some situations are clever.  The Pros: it starts the same night as HALLOWEEN left off, and a particularly likable shot where Michael Myers fades perfectly into light from the darkness behind a women (the result is unpleasant, though).  Overall, this one amounts to a pointless gore fest, with little or none suspense and a waste of the title. HALLOWEEN was different, it was unique, so why did they have to be superficial and create a bad sequel?  *1/2 out of ****.",Halloween II
314,crukeg,A true gem. underrated and misunderstood,8,18 May 2006,"This is a very good sequel to the brilliant original.It certainly surpasses the quality of the dreadful Halloweens 4,5 and 6. When Laurie is taken to the hospital after barely escaping Michael myers she encounters him once again in a fabulous chase scene. She must escape again.Like the first movie Halloween 2 is shot with skill as to heighten mood and atmosphere. The film does feature a pointless subplot, but it doesn't deter from the fear the film generates.This is the best sequel in the franchise.Id like to take this opportunity to say that Halloween 3 sucked !!!",Halloween II
315,Andreas_W333,"Heavily underrated sequel, on the whole a better film than the first one, and this one is not even directed by Carpenter.",10,24 August 2021,"First off, thank you John Carpenter for creating one of the world's best soundtracks and refining the main theme to even higher levels and adding several wonderful themes in this film. John Carpenter's contribution to this film is extremely strong, and he has some writing credits also. Sadly, he seems to despise this film for reasons I can't understand because I can't understand why. It's better directed than the first one, has less goofs, the main actors actually has reasonable lines and it's packed with tension. The director here directed JLC to act in a believable way and Loomis doesn't sound like a poet on the streets as soon as he has a line. This movie also adds depth with the back story which was of course nowhere to be seen in the first and made Michaels killing spree more senseless. So this movie brings a lot to the table. A really good slasher film that tries to explain why Michael survived in the first film, and does so and get away with it. Deserves praise, and definitely the best one of them all.",Halloween II
316,zaur-2,Most amazing scene,10,28 October 2005,"This was an excellent film and the creepy hospital gave in an air of even more creepyness. The only thing I would have added was some creepy zombie like patients moving around as well. The Mr. Sandman at the end was totally freaky as well. Myres and Loomis of course come back again later despite being blown up. The William Shatner mask always gets me. It's so creepy and the lack of expression is always there. I keep waiting for him to say, ""Hey... Spock.. I... am...here.. to... murder you"" The best scene of all though would have to be the Pamela Susan Shoop in the hot tub. She has one of the most amazing racks that I've ever seen, and even before she dies we get a huge and dramatic view of them. A 10 for that scene alone.",Halloween II
317,driver_8,"OK, it is not as great as the original",8,13 May 2004,"However, this is not totally terrible. Yeah, it does kind of paint by the numbers and there is nothing innovative, like the first one. However, compared to the future sequels of this film, it was brilliant! However, compared to the first, it is lacking. This film seems to be more about running up a body count. The plot seems to be lacking. One can tell that John Carpenter was not involved here, because there is no real heart. However, we still have Michael on the prowl. We still have Dr. Loomis trying to track him down. We still have Laurie Strode getting stalked and we have at least a touch of the first one.

But what the hell did they do with original Halloween score...it didn't scare me very much.There were a few scenes that were scary like where Michael pops up and kills that girl at the start, and the bathtub scene and the last scene with Michael , loomis and Laurie. i don't know..it just didn't have the brilliance of the first film but it was a defiantly great sequel.It's My third Favourite Halloween Movie!",Halloween II
319,jones-markjones-mark592,Halloween II - More of the Same,3,22 July 2018,"Now this is a sequel! Halloween II occurs instantly after the first film and even opens with a recap of how it ended. Then the movie starts...Now, quick warning, this review will be more of a rant about the film and the whole series I've seen so far because, quite frankly, I'm tired of this franchise already and I've only seen two entries. Basically, the plot of this film is exactly the same as the original. Michael Myers tries to hunt down Laurie Strode, whilst Michael's psychiatrist hunts him down. One thing I can say though is the psychiatrist does actually get more to do here than just stand by a house. The main issue with this film is there is a constant lack of tension and drama throughout. For example, the entire climax is laughable. Music is used sparingly and all we have for tension in the final battle is a plethora of silly sound effects with Myers swiping at empty air. Are we seriously supposed to be frightened by that? Also, is Michael Myers' signature weapon a scalpel? I'm asking you here, because it's one of the least effective and scary weapons I've ever seen a serial killer use. Also, the huge plot twist of Lorie and Michael being siblings is handled EXTREMELY poorly. Firstly, it's reveal lacks excitement and is just given in causal conversation which nobody is surprised by. Secondly, is Myers' motivation really just to kill his siblings? I'm asking you again because that is one stupid motivation for such a famous horror icon. Thirdly, it changes NOTHING. No added drama. No sympathy from Michael or Lorie. It's completely pointless and adds nothing to the subsequent scenes after its reveal. That's bad writing, full stop. Again, we get no backstory about Michael's mystical powers and why he's so hard to kill. Therefore, I'm gonna say it, Michael Myers is a boring villain. All he does is walk VERY, VERY slowly and hardly kills anyone. When he does kill, more often than not, the kills are underwhelming and cheap. All except one kill in a boiling hot bath which burns a woman's face which is easily the standout moment in both of these films. All in all, another crap entry in what's said to be the best horror franchise ever. Better than Friday, better than Nightmare, better than Scream. Well, right now, I'd rather watch Jason Takes Manhattan than this crap. Please, just please, let this franchise improve, or I'll worry about the upcoming entry.",Halloween II
320,sjhollen,Pretty good,7,22 June 2020,"The good: the hospital setting, Dick Warlocks performance, Donald pleasance's performance, some good killsThe bad: gets a little boring around the middle, the Michael and laurie being related revelation, not enough Laurie in it, shows Michael Myers too much and we get no character development.This is in no way a bad movie. I actually think it's one of the best in the franchise and I think Dick Warlock is a great shape even though I've heard complaints that he's too robotic. I always watch this around Halloween time, just not on tv cause for some reason they always put rob zombies H2 on instead on all the marathons",Halloween II
321,barrynewblood,An OK Continuation of the Original,7,6 September 2021,"Halloween II picks up exactly where the first film left off and Dr. Loomis is still trying to get the townspeople and police force to understand that Michael Myers is more than just a normal man. Laurie Strode, the previous film's survivor, has been taken to a local hospital where Michael Myers tracks her down, leaving a trail of bloody bodies down the empty corridors in his wake.In a narrative sense, Halloween II has little to offer. Much of it feels like a stale repeat of scenes from the original where Myers lurks in a corner unbeknownst to his victim only to leap out and impale them with a knife. This time, thanks to the hospital setting, his arsenal of weapons has been expanded and he occasionally puts down his knife to use hammers, scalpels, hypodermic needles, and even hot tubs to creatively kill his victims. It's definitely a grislier and gorier film than the original.Jamie Lee Curtis has little to do which hurts the film, but I'd be lying if I were to say there aren't more than a few creepy moments and memorable images in the film that make it worth a watch.",Halloween II

323,Bub_the_zombie,Rewatchable.,8,26 May 2007,"Halloween 2 is one of those rare occasions when a sequel is as equally enjoyable as the first film. Halloween is technically a much better film than Halloween II, but Halloween II has a higher re-watch rate.Rick Rosenthal gave us a pretty uneven film with H2, and it's rumored that Carpenter had to do a number of re-shoots after trying to make something of Rosenthal's shoddy work.Halloween II picks up directly where Halloween left off. Michael is now carrying around six bullets with him - which should have left him a little slow. But, we all know Mike is one crazy son of a gun and isn't gonna allow six slugs to the torso to slow him down.He kills his way to the medical facility where Laurie is admitted and stalks the eerie halls of Haddonfield Clinic. The clinical setting is truly a saving grace for H2. The whole place is eerie. It's a perfect place to set the film.Halloween 2 climbs the gore pole this time. Instead of relying on suspense throughout, the gore angle is exploited - and poof! - Halloween 2 becomes a bodycount slasher film made popular by films like Friday the 13th and The Burning.Nevertheless, H2 does a really good job. There's some good stalk sequences. Jamie Lee hardly has any dialog this time. She's left in a virtual state of 'unspeaking' as she does what she does best...run from masked killers. (Although, she's not doing much running. She's pretty much incapacitated and limps heavily) Donald Pleasance is still putting on quiet a show. He proved even more so that he's obsessed with Myers, eventually throwing his on well being on the line to try and end the reign of terror inspired by Myers.Anyway, there's a little 'unevenness' throughout, but it's still manageable. The editing looks as if it was done by a five year old. but we're able to overlook this and see this for the giant cheese spectacle it really is.Great atmosphere. Creepy location. Everything that made part one famous, but on a more sporadic level. This doesn't mean it's done better, but in a broader theatrical sense considering the body-count slasher film was in it's explosion at the time.",Halloween II
324,vince200002000,A Nice Follow Up Of The Original,7,24 September 2007,":CAUTION: MAY CONTIAN SPOILERS As part II of the series, Halloween II picks up as if it were still the original. I shows the rest of Michael's killing spree on the same night. Besides the fact that Michael's mask has changed and some of the characters from the original seeming to be a little different. It has pretty much the same plot of Michael trying to kill Laurie but it just seems dumbed down. The theme music and such has dumbed down a bit as well, but it's not that bad. Another great performance by Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence as they continue their roles as Laurie Strode and Dr. Loomis. Laurie has been taken to the Haddonfield Momorial Hospital and of course Michael fallows her there with the same motive from the last movie. The story is OK, pretty boring at times but over all it's a pretty good sequel.",Halloween II
325,rochericky,Halloween II,10,18 June 2006,"Distributor: HGV video productions Plot: Picking up precisely where its predecessor left off, Halloween II follows the same ill fated characters as they encounter the knife wielding maniac they left for dead in the first Halloween. It seems that Michael Myers escaped the fall and is now out for revenge as he stalks the VERY deserted halls of Haddonfield Memorial Hospital where his sister lies waiting. Halloween II is a spine tingling dark ride into the scariest night of the year. Halloween II...just when you thought it was safe to go trick-or-treating again.Audio/Video: Pretty average picture quality from HGV.Extras: None.Final Thoughts: Haloween II is just as good as part 1. 1981 was the year when a lot of horror movies were using hospitals as their location (Visiting Hours, Hospital Massacre), but Halloween II was the best out of them all. If only some distribution company would make a complete Halloween II DVD with the television cut included. Now that would be a treat. This movie is highly recommended.",Halloween II
326,vukaroo,The Proper Sequel,10,24 October 2018,"I personally feel that this film is THEE quintessential sequel to H1 (1978). The reason I feel this way is plain and simple: this film effectively shows Michael Myers' interminable transformation from human to an immortal killing machine. The suspense just keeps on building from the original, thanks to Dr. Loomis' continual quest to kill the ""monster"" and Laurie's questionable fate due to certain developments in the relationship of she and Myers. All in all, I would say that H2 is perhaps scarier than the original and that includes the fantastic soundtrack provided by John Carpenter. I definitely recommend this film to horror movie buffs and fans of H1 and definitely choose this one over Halloween (2018).",Halloween II
327,reiss-ferlance,Do you want mayonnaise on your sandwich? How about mustard?,8,29 January 2007,"I think I'll have mayonnaise on my sandwich(!) Halloween 2 is the first sequel to John Carpenter's outstanding horror classic Halloween. Halloween 2 takes place exactly where Halloween finished. Halloween 2 is one of the better Halloween sequels in the series. This film sustains similar atmosphere that the first instalment has, which is one of the reasons I like this film. The acting in this movie entertains in a similar way Halloween did. The plot unwinds itself with interesting interaction between characters and with a good dose of humour. This movies features loads of thrilling scenes and interesting dialogue that grabs the viewers attention. Overall this film will entertain audiences, especially audiences that have seen or are familiar with the first Halloween movies. Halloween is not better than the first Halloween bout it's surely a great horror movie, horror movie fans will be pleased with Halloween 2.",Halloween II
328,davisond-95730,Almost as good as the first,9,24 March 2021,"The first movie was intended to be a standalone movie but fans demanded more Michael Myers and this is what we get. The sequel does something most movies don't do and that's having a continuation from the ending of the original, it literally picks up where the first ends and can be seen as one long great horror movie.Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis return to reprise the roles of Dr Loomis and Laurie Strode in this sequel and with once again a simple premise, Laurie is taken to hospital to recover from her injuries and Michael Pursues her. One thing that was unique about the original movie was that the kills were lacking in the blood and guts department relying on the suspense and intensity to give the deaths a bigger impact. This movie ups the gore to compete with the constant 80's slashers.The suspense is slightly lacking this time around as we are all focused on one setting, the hospital. The only suspense felt is that you never know what part of the building Michael is in. We are given another chase scene but it also feels a bit of lack in comparison to Laurie stumbling across her dead friends. There is a much bigger body count this time around and some deaths not even responsible by the hands of Myers. The score yet again nowhere near has an effect the way the other movie did it but it's still a memorable one none of the less and the cinematography might have a slight improvement continuing the POV tracking shots.What I can say is the final act in my opinion is much better. Loomis sacrificing himself for Laurie's survival is a memorable moment in the franchise and serves up as a true ending if you don't feel like continuing the franchise and I also love the plot twist connecting Laurie and Michael, it gives a reason for him hunting her down but in some ways lessens the scare factor because him stalking a random girl made it a lot more creepy than him having an actual reason.Overall I think movie is a worthy sequel and every Halloween you should watch this and 1978 back to back

329,Newsgeek13,Halloween review: Part 2,7,2 November 2013,"While Halloween was a pretty much perfect for a slasher movie. Halloween 2 isn't as good. I do like how it continues the story of the first one and ends the 'real' story. I also like the hospital environment. I kinda like the idea of trick or treater's having the same costume as Michael Myers, but the movie kind of ruins it with one scene. This movie is not as settle as the first. This movie is where they decided that every sequel will up the anti on the violence. Which means that there is a bit more blood and gore. I don't mind that in this and Halloween III, but the sequels after wards kept up with that idea and i think that might of contributed to my disliking of most of the sequels. While this one isn't as good, it still holds up for me. Well that's my movie review for Halloween this year. Sorry it's late, i have been kind of busy with other life and all. As always, thanks for reading, check them out for your self's.",Halloween II
330,haudit,A good (if not brilliant) follow up to the original,5,2 November 2001,"'Halloween II' should be viewed as a direct continuation of the original film, and as such, it works well, if not brilliantly. 
There are many effective scares throughout the film, none more so than the heart-pounding chase of Laurie by Michael Myers through the hospital towards the end of the film.  Everything in that almost 6 minute scene is perfect - the direction, the acting, and the music!!  Where do I start with the music? Alan Howarth took John Carpenter's original score and beefed it up with some then state of the art synthesiser sounds, making it sound more frightening than it did in 'Halloween'.  Dean Cundey's cinematography should also be commended, as should director Rick Rosenthal for sticking so closely to John Carpenter's directorial style in 'Halloween'.  There are a few problems I have with the film, however.  The first is the lack of continuity with the original.  Laurie's hair looked the same, but everything else seemed slightly different to me.  I may be wrong, but when we saw Myers' eyes in the original, weren't they brown, but in 'Halloween II', when we saw them (when he stabs the girl in the throat), they looked distinctly blue to me.   But the rest of the film is, if not stunning, then at least arresting visually.  The Hospital seemed fairly realistic to me, a lot of people seem to have a problem with it having so few staff, but having spent a night in a very large hospital which covers a whole region and not just a small town like Haddonfield Memorial did, I can testify that at night in hospitals, staff are indeed very few and far between. 
I also liked the deaths (rumour has it John Carpenter found the style of the film too old fashioned in comparison with Friday the 13th, and so shot gory inserts for the death scenes behind Rick Rosenthal's back).  The deaths involve a hammer to the head, a girl being drowned in a very very hot hydrotherapy pool, a nurse having her blood drained and an assistant getting an anaesthetic injected directly into her brain.Aside from a few slight problems with continuity, I found 'Halloween II' an interesting and worthy successor to the original 'Halloween' and definitely better than any of the other sequels or 'Halloween' imitators, with the possible exception of 'Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later'.***1/2 out of *****",Halloween II

The acting isn't all that good but Halloween II turns out to be a fairly good horror movie with effective scares, and still the minimum of explicit gore.  However, you can tell it was made on  a very tight budget, and it does look rather miserable when compared to the later sequels.Relatively good, and deserves 6 out of 10.",Halloween II
332,juniorrickman,"Not Needed, but Entertaining Enough",7,15 October 2020,"Trading in atmosphere and suspense for gore and soap opera plot twists, Halloween II picks up where the original left off and Dr. Loomis is on a mad hunt to find Michael Myers before he kills again or gets to Laurie Strode who is now sleeping off the night's horrors in a understaffed hospital.Director Rick Rosenthal does a great job of keeping Halloween II feeling like a direct continuation of the original film. Dean Cundey's cinematography helps connect the dots and Carpenter's score gets a gothic, synthy revamp with Alan Howarth. The main drawback are the poorly drawn new characters, the silly twist, and a heroine who spend 85% of the movie in bed and sedated.",Halloween II
333,The Film Buff,A solid sequel and one of the better slasher films,10,27 January 2002,"(WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!)Though HALLOWEEN II in no way lives up to the classic original, it does provide a few good scares, some suspense and mucho gore. This second entry in the series isn't for everyone but it's well crafted and deserves a better reputation than the one it has.In a clever plot twist, the film takes place directly after the first one, with masked lunatic Michael Meyers surviving his supposedly fatal fall from a balcony and stealing a new knife from a neighbor lady. Laurie Strode is taken to the nearby hospital while Dr. Loomis resumes his search for the escaped psycho. After killing a couple pointless characters Mike finally sets his targets on Laurie and sneaks into the almost abandoned hospital, searching room-for-room for his next victim-to-be. HALLOWEEN II is a mixed bag. On one hand, director Rick Rosenthal nicely captures the atmosphere of the original and delivers some genuine shocks, but for the most part this plays more like your average FRIDAY THE 13TH clone, complete with gory murders, sleazy sex and shamefully underdeveloped characters. The best example of this is Laurie. In the original the film was basically about her and the problems that she faced, not just with Michael, but with her friends and herself. Here she is just as expendable as the other characters. Not only does she not reappear until thirty minutes into the movie, but when she finally is reintroduced, all she does is sleep and wander aimlessly through the halls! In fact, by now I could really consider Michael the main character of this movie! The first half is basically made up of him sneaking through houses and around the town before the film finally shifts gears and focuses on the victims-to-be.That said and done, once HALLOWEEN II gets going it IS kinda' scary. The film's best moments come during the scenes of subtle suspense and terror, not the ultra-gory killings. The scenes of Michael roaming through the empty corridors of the hospital, while Laurie sits hopelessly in her room waiting for the final confrontation, are very tense and if the entire movie could've had that same effect it could of been a classic. Another memorable moment is when Michael chases the helpless Laurie through the hospital in the now-familiar, but this time rather unsettling, climatic showdown.So all in all I can't really give HALLOWEEN II my basic star rating. As a slasher film all in itself it's fairly good, but as a sequel to one of the greatest horror movies ever made, well . . . This is not the best sequel but it is the scariest, and I whole-heartedly recommend this to any die-hard slasher or HALLOWEEN fanatics.",Halloween II
334,markdecarlo-98321,That Wig!,7,17 February 2021,"As a sequel that continues the mood and vibe of the original, Halloween II succeeds with flying colors. I'm convinced you could splice the two of them together and, besides a rather appalling wig on Jamie Lee Curtis, you wouldn't be able to tell it wasn't the same movie. Where it doesn't succeed is with the story. It ends up becoming an atmospheric, but empty re-telling of the same story but with a few silly twists thrown in towards the end that only work to make it less frightening and paint the franchise into a corner. That said, there's a creepy vibe throughout that's irresistible and many of the kill scenes are inspired.",Halloween II
335,benjaminryder-45940,More of the Night He Came Home,9,23 September 2019,"Halloween always struck me as one of those movies that didn't need a sequel. It was scary enough knowing that Michael Myers was still out there, lurking and ready to make you his next victim. Inevitably, sequels always destroy a lot of the mystique surrounding the original film and they answer too many questions. Typically, the answers we came up with in our heads were more interesting or frightening than what a bunch of studio execs dreamt up.Halloween II proves to suffer a bit of sequelitis here and there - namely with a completely silly twist towards the end involving Laurie and Michael's connection which squeezed the rest of the series into a bit of a creative dead end. Still, there's a lot to love about the film.It seamlessly picks up right where the original ended and thanks to Dean Cundey returning as the director of photography, the film's look matches very well with the original film, helping bridge that gap. Jamie Lee Curtis' wig for Laurie doesn't match quite as well, but you forget about it after awhile mainly because Laurie is sidelined in a hospital under sedation for most of the film until the finale. This leaves the film with the increasingly mad Loomis as the closest thing we have to a protagonist in the story. The rest of the hospital staff might as well be made of cardboard or walking slabs of meat for Michael Myers to carve up.And carve he does! Michael has gotten a bit more creative since we last saw him and he's not above giving his trusty kitchen knife a rest and using hypodermic needles, hammers, scalding hot water, and scalpels to inflict various types of bodily harm to anyone unfortunate enough to enter his sight lines.The finale is well executed with some true suspense and it would have been a satisfying enough conclusion to the Michael Myers saga if they'd left it at his, but you know Hollywood...",Halloween II
336,ralphgillis,An Unfortunate Fall From Grace,4,29 September 2021,"29 September 2000I love the original Halloween movie that came out in 1978. It's a horror movie that works on every level. The sequel however is a massive disappointment, it follows all the slasher cliches and it is nowhere as good as the original.Halloween 2 is not a very good movie but it seems as if the new director (Rick Rosenthal) did that on purpose. The flaws are not perceived as mistakes. It's very easy to understand the direction Rosenthal wanted to follow. He wanted gorier death scenes, nudity and overall he chose to take the high road which means pleasing the key audience demographic (teenagers and young adults). Back in the 80s slasher flicks were extremely popular and teens just could never get enough of it. Slowly that trend faded away and it's never been the same, thank god for that.This sequel does not have the suspense and tension that the original movie owned perfectly. A serial killer in a house is a lot more terrifying than one in a hospital. Open space diminishes fear because the safety of an individual depends on the location they are in. The size of a typical house can give the viewer a sense of claustrophobia that will expand the fear they are feeling inside of themselves. That's only one of the many elements that make the original a frightening motion picture. Some of the cinematography is interesting because of how obscure some of the shots are and I just love it when they show Micheal slowly creep up to his victim, very effective and a great way of creating anxiety.Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) delivers an average performance, she doesn't know how to make her injuries look genuine because she can never decide when she has to stand up, crawl or run. The entire progression of her chase sequences feel uneven because of her misunderstanding of how she had to act in the specific scenes. Donald Pleasance is fine in the film, it's not a very demanding role and it doesn't require much skill to portray. Dick Warlock (Micheal Myers) is very good and he is ruthless and aggressive during the kills. The mask is wider and a bit less appealing when compared to it's predecessor. The fact that Laurie is the sister is interesting but they should've delved deeper into the idea.I don't recommend Halloween 2 to a viewer who is not particularly into horror films but if you do like slashers and find them somewhat enjoyable then watch it even though i'm certain you probably did if you are into this sub-genre.",Halloween II
337,robertlauter25,Never get's old,8,31 October 2015,"it's halloween night 2015 and halloween II is on amc as I writes this review. I decided to check out how many stars it got and I was convinced it was way too low so I actually logged on to come to it's defense.First off all the complaints are pretty petty, one person called it sexist, well everything made before the mid 90's seems sexist to those who don't study film history. And? a Sexist movie can't be good? Aren't Gone With The Wind, Casablanca and the Quiet Man sexist by today's standards? A few people complained that the hospital it was set in was too dark? Well it's called artistic license move along. Some people stated the victims weren't like-able enough..This is particularly absurd, because held to this standard the original Halloween failed because neither Nancy Loomis or P.J soles who died in that one where exactly Doris Day.About the only critique I agree with is the whole Jamie Lee Curtis being Michael Meyer's sister angle, however the flashback sequences referring to it are creepy and added to the film, the movie could have just alluded to it using this scene, and left the whole scene out with it being explained to loomis (and the audience) and worked out another way for loomis to wind up at the hospital.Aside from that I can't find anything lacking about this film. The musical score is improved from the original, whoever says otherwise is tone deaf. Kudos to the guy who pointed out the argento-esque sequences I never really picked up on it until reading your review.That's about it. Happy Halloween II",Halloween II
338,matthewmercy,He's still on the loose...,5,25 June 2012,"1981's Halloween II was, like Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), one of those sequels to a mega-grossing box office hit that was pushed into production despite a distinct lack of enthusiasm from the key creative forces behind the initial film. In much the same way that actor Charlton Heston was tempted back to continue the story of his classic original by the promise of reduced involvement in the follow-up's creation, an almost sure-fire guarantee of further box office success, and an opportunity to bring his previously open-ended saga to an (apparently) irrevocable conclusion, original Halloween director John Carpenter agreed to supervise production and provide a screenplay for this sequel to his 1978 hit, even if he left the actual helming duties to the unknown Rick Rosenthal (and then, dissatisfied with the results, ended up shooting some additional sequences for the film himself anyway). Picking up at the exact point the first Halloween left off, the sequel follows the continuing pursuit of near-supernatural stalk-and-slash maniac Michael Myers by both the police and the determined Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence), whilst the injured and traumatised Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken away to recover in a local hospital. However, Myers' near-indestructible nature, coupled with an unexpected new plot revelation, ensures that he hasn't yet quite finished with Laurie... Halloween II is not a particularly well-made or memorable movie, and certainly lacks the atmosphere of terror and expertly-handled scares of the first film; in keeping with the times, and the flood of killer-on-the-loose cack that proliferated in the wake of Carpenter's initial low budget hit, the sequel goes for a gorier, less subtle approach to the theme (though ironically, this was largely down to Carpenter's input, rather than Rosenthal's). Curtis, who, like Carpenter, wasn't keen on returning to the story, isn't as effective here as she was in the original, but at least her continuing presence assists with the continuity, as does that of the wonderful Pleasence, who is excellent in a significantly-expanded encore as the obsessive Loomis. But, without wanting to give anything away to those who haven't seen it, there is no doubt that this second go-round for Michael Myers should have been the last we heard of him (especially given the sequel's seemingly very conclusive ending); unfortunately, the 'low cost, big profit' nature of this kind of horror movie meant that there were no fewer than six more sequels of wildly varying quality to come (including three starring Pleasence and two more featuring Curtis), plus a 2007 remake, and a sequel to that (!). Not bad for a movie madman a lot of people haven't been able to take seriously since Wayne's World (1992) came out...",Halloween II
339,Mike-469,Decent sequel if you suspend your disbelief -- a LOT,4,8 January 1999,"The problem I have with this movie and so many others like it is that it is so incredibly unbelievable.  The idea that someone who walks as slowly as Michael Myers does could accomplish so much without anyone seeing him is incredible.  Think about it...he had to break into the school and leave some telling little clues, then he had to WALK all the way to the hospital, where he is able to creatively kill numerous doctors and nurses, and still find time to go outside and slash all of the car tires.  Does this make sense? Of course not.  The movie also seemed slow and anti-climatic to me...maybe for its day it was considered fast and cutting edge, but it just can't hold up today.  If you're a fan of the genre, I suppose you'll find it entertaining, but if not, well...Don't say I didn't warn you.",Halloween II
340,bhanna23,Best Sequel Ever!!,10,17 September 2001,"It's rare to come across a sequel that is actually just as great as the original, but here you have it. It starts off right where halloween left off, so right from the start you know you're in for a good ride. Of course this is a sequel so the body count is a bit higher, but there's nothing wrong with that. Halloween is a good horror series, I can't wait for Halloween ""The Homecoming"". I hope to see a 9th and maybe a 10th in the future.",Halloween II
341,Jeffronthi-950-543134,Solid Continuation,7,13 January 2019,"A 7.5 is a more accurate rating.This film starts off dead where the previous left off, and it moves along rather nicely, only slowing up to build tension. As far as sequels usually go, it is amazing this turned out as well as it did. The pacing is great, the acting is fun and believable, and while it is far more clinical than the original (bigger budget), it still retains the urgency and dread of the original. It is a bit hokey and made-for-TV-esque in parts, but for me, that is where the faults end.The Shape is in true menacing form, and that is mucho appreciated. Dick Warlock was my favorite Shape, no question. He is agile, he practically glides, and his performance is mostly good, if not always consistent. Occasionally he is a bit too slow. But it's his body's quick, angular movements that are terrificly done. His pace is slow, but his movements are creepy. It is a cool juxtaposition.For those of you who never read the novelization of this - do it!Great sequel.",Halloween II
342,transient-2,boo.,1,22 June 2005,"Halloween II sets the stage for a consistent continuation of the original but the stage is so ridiculous: can you believe a dark hospital? OK, how about an empty one? OK, how about a hospital with no doctors in it? A warehouse might have been a better stage for Halloween II; our suspension of disbelief is already constrained by Michael Meyers, and the film becomes pure silliness when he's transplanted to a world we have never seen before. Unlikely characters in unlikely places get killed in unlikely ways. Weeee! Is there room in the hospital hot tub for me too? No amount of marijuana could prevent this movie from boring (or annoying) a fan of horror films.",Halloween II
343,ddupreee,Almost as good as the first one,9,7 March 2021,"Halloween 2 is almost as good as the original, and I love that the series makes Michael Myers kind of a unstoppable force. The setting in the hospital is also pretty cool, and the chase at the end is perfect. Although there are some problems like all sequels. I recommend you watch Halloween 2.",Halloween II
344,chrisgriffintv,Decent Sequel to a good film.,6,8 May 2021,"Halloween 2 is an alright follow up to a good slasher despite the odd retcon here and there. Micheal Myers death is very satisfying, showing him walk slowly before falling shows he is truly strong. It's one of the best entries in the franchise.",Halloween II
345,PhillipMichaelH,Just as great as the first movie.,10,24 August 2011,"Released in 1981, Halloween 2 lives up to what it promises, a horror sequel. After the first film, which was shot on a very low budget, surpassed everyone's expectations by becoming the highest grossing independent film in history, major studios were making a series of imitators, one of them being Sean Cuningham's Friday The 13th (1980), which was released by Paramount and a blood stained or more commercial answer to Halloween. It's ironic that the same studios who turned John Carpenter's horror thriller down were making their own films about serial killers stalking teenagers, most of them being uninspired compared to the original Halloween. There are a few exceptions though, like Wes Craven's superb A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984).Anyway, back to this movie. Universal Studios began approaching John Carpenter and Debra Hill with the idea of a sequel, for which they declined at first. Even Debra Hill said herself in a 2002 interview that a sequel was ""The furthest thing from our minds"". After Moustapha Akkad (finacer of the first film) agreed to make a follow up, Carpenter and Hill said that they would produce it and write the screenplay but only if the film were be to directed by someone else. Carpenter originally handed the opportunity to direct Halloween 2 over to Tommy Lee Wallace, who was the production designer and editor of the first film. Wallace didn't care for the script that Carpenter and Hill wrote and stated that he wasn't attached to the story so he dropped out of the project. The responsibility of directing would eventually go to an unknown director named Rick Rosenthal who had made a short film that Carpenter was impressed with which is the reason why Rosenthal got the job.Carpenter and Hill decided to make this movie a continuation of the first film, it picks up exactly where the first one left off and takes place completely on the same night as the fist film. After it is revealed at the end of the first film that Michael Myers is not dead, police are out around town looking for him, along with Dr. Loomis who knows for sure that Myers is still alive. Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to the hospital after surviving from Michael's bloody rampage. She appears to be safe but Myers soon finds out about where she is and makes his way to the clinic and of course, all hell breaks lose. It appears that the nightmare isn't over yet and audiences will have to find out if Laurie (or anyone for that matter) will survive the rest of the night.Production began in early 1981, Jamie Lee Curtis returned to play the role that made her famous from the first film, Laurie Strode. Dean Cundey, who was the cinematographer on the first Halloween, returned also to bring his unique visual approach. This time, to play Michael Myers, the filmmakers brought in a stunt man named Dick Warlock who had worked on many movies as a stunt man for many years. The always loyal Donald Plescence also returned from the first film to play Dr. Loomis, his performance feels just as focused as it was the first time around. Besides Jamie Lee and Donald, an entire new cast was added to play the residents at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, which most of the film takes place at. There was a lot of tension on the set, Carpenter and director Rick Rosenthal had a different vision on what the finished film should be and and producer Debra Hill said that the movie was very difficult to be fully realized. When the film was finished, Carpenter was not happy with it and even said that Rosenthal should completely change his movie, stating that it wasn't frighting enough. Carpenter has said in an interview that he shot the opening scenes in the movie and that he was not happy doing it but that it had to be done to make the movie better. This is the film that you see today.Released on October 30th of 1981, Halloween 2 was a box office hit and while Carpenter and Hill were not pleased with the film, audiences enjoyed it. Rick Rosenthal, while his experience with Carpenter may have not been pleasant, has said that he thinks the movie ""holds up very well"" and ""is still really scary"". Rosenthal would return to direct another Halloween sequel 20 years later, the 2002 film Halloween: Resurrection. As for my views on the film, I feel that this movie is just as great as the first film and just as scary and entertaining. This film was much darker in terms of style and of course, there is more gore this time around. While the first film has no scenes of graphic violence, we can all assume that John Carpenter was feeling (as Tommy Lee Wallace stated) the pressures of the market place. Films like Friday The 13th had much more blood and violence in them so Carpenter wrote Halloween 2 including more of that. I still feel that this movie is just as suspenseful and while not as pure as the first film, still a good movie, I would say that it's great even. The atmosphere is well done and includes really nice camera work from Dean Cundey. If you're a horror fan then this movie should please you.",Halloween II
346,rhiron,"I Shot Him, I Shot Him Six Times!!! He...He Isn't Human!!",8,7 November 2013,"I only discovered around a year and a half ago that sequels were made to the original ""Halloween"" (1978) and, whilst I made it my business to get them all (including the Rob Zombie remakes) this is, by far, the best of them!Don't ask me why, but I actually prefer this to John Carpenter's original -- not that it's better or anything like that. Carpenter remains the father of Michael Myers and what he did on such a restricted budget was amazing.But I still think that, despite the increase in violence, this film is still entertaining and, at times, quite thrilling.Even though she simply spends most of her time in the film running and cowering from Michael Myers/The Shape (reportedly whilst wearing a wig to match her hair from the first film), I love the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis reprised her role as Laurie Strode. And, despite this, her character still gets developed in a major way that should have drawn the story behind these two 'Halloween' films to a satisfactory close. The other 'Halloween' sequels just aren't the same without their original scream queen, even though she did return for the reunion twenty years after the original and Rick Rosenthal's second stab at the series!But Michael Myers is like Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger. He's an unforgettable icon of horror and a human blob for audiences to focus all their personal fears on to. As Carpenter and Loomis would say ""Evil never dies!"" Though, I frankly didn't even notice that Nick Castle didn't return to play Myers this time around.Donald Pleasence is, if anything, even more entertaining in this sequel and is always a pleasure to watch as Dr. Sam Loomis -- his most influential role since playing Blofeld in 'You Only Live Twice' (1967), so much so that his willingness to continue playing Loomis makes me wonder why he wasn't recalled to portray the cat-stroking Bond villain, at least in 'Diamonds Are Forever' (1971).Nancy Stephens makes a great return as Loomis' chain-smoking, slightly cynical nurse, Marion Chambers (whose car was attacked by Myers in the first film), whose role I find slightly poignant as the film progresses, as she sets up most of the film's plot. Charles Cyphers also returns briefly as Sheriff Brackett and even Nancy Loomis gets a brief cameo as his daughter, Annie, despite the fact that her character is dead!Lance Guest, who went on to star in the ill-fated 'Jaws: The Revenge' (1987) gets quite a good role here but, other than that, most of the characters are (as in most other horror films) set up simply to be cut down. Not that that's a real problem -- this film was probably meant to do to hospitals what 'Psycho' (1960) did to showers!!Admittedly, Rob Zombie's attempt at the hospital chase had a lot more gore and tension to it and didn't drag on for half as much time, but the finale is a real blast and the addition of The Chordettes' song 'Mr. Sandman' is quite catchy, even though it doesn't make much sense in that it's a love song. Unless it's meant for Jamie Lee Curties and Lance Guest's characters... Or as a twisted symbol for Michael's arrival in Laurie's life...Anyway, this is quite a good sequel and, for those of you who enjoyed seeing P.J. Soles bearing all in the Carpenter original, Pamela Susan Shoop gets tasked with that duty this time around!I guess it's an indication of how much horror cinema in the early 1980's had changed since 'Halloween' arrived in the late 1970's, but this is just what you might expect. Bloody, violent, a fair amount of nudity -- but still tolerable and still enjoyable, not just because of all of the above!! To compete with other horror films of the time, it even has its own share of inventive death scenes over the original.As I say, the finale is great and the entire film is helped along by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth having remixed Carpenter's original score, as well as the even greater use of location work. Watch out for Rick Rosenthal's adaptation of the pumpkin from the original opening titles, this time serving an even more graphic use...",Halloween II
347,drdre1,"Great sequel, just as scary and suspenseful as the first",7,29 January 2001,"The sequel to Halloween seems to have conflicts among critic's opinions. Some seem to like the movie, while others hate it. In my opinion, as a horror sequel, it has to be one of the best. This sequel continues on the same night as the first movie, as Michael Myers is still  alive and continues to pursue Laurie Strode. The suspense and scares are still very present in the sequel, and seem to be pretty close to the original. However, some people may not like this movie. Simply because it has no plot whatsoever. It really just seems like the sequel could of just been added to the end of the movie. But, this is a HORROR movie, where really most of the time we seem to ignore the plot.

The sequel picks up just after Detective Loomis has shot Michael at the end of Halloween 1. Laurie Strode is then carted off to the hospital.The main aspect of this film that fails is reality. The first film was in a very minute way plausible. In this film the setting is completely unbelievable and while it successfully carries the mood of the movie, it just doesn't match up to the original. The main character of this film by far is not Laurie, who has maybe a dozen lines, or Loomis, but Michael. For most of the movie we watch as Michael walk around through a very dark hospital as he slowly kills off nurses and doctors in various fashions.It seems as if the director, Rick Rosenthal, was not trying to follow the original, but rather out do the slip-shod rip offs of Halloween.

350,LuckyMatt93,Best sequel in the series,9,28 March 2009,"It is rare that horror sequels (or any film sequels) manage to capture the tone and essence of their predecessor. However Halloween II, made 3 years after John Carpenter's original, does just that and overall comes out to be a successful exercise in terror. The film continues from the moment Halloween left off. Not to spoil the plot, Laurie is taken to the local hospital where she is again pursued by Michael Myers. It is this continuation of the story, as well as Rosenthal's attempts to recreate Carpenter's visual style (still lots of long POV tracking shots) which differentiates Halloween II from the other sequels in the series; it actually serves to further the plot in an interesting way and remains consistent with the first film's style and content. A very worthy film when taken on its own, it also serves as the concluding episode to the first part in the Halloween franchise.Rosenthal uses the hospital setting to great advantage. With only a skeleton crew working, the hospital is dark, empty, and has an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia. In several scenes, Rosenthal uses the darkness of the hospital to mask Michael's presence in a room only to have him appear as the light shifts, which is a truly chilling effect. Much more chilling than anything in the later sequels.Critics generally bashed the film because of the blood and gore. I find this completely ludicrous, because whatever blood and gore it did have hardly affected anything. There actually isn't even that much when compared to the later sequels.All and all Halloween II is a great follow up to the classic original. It's the best sequel out of the series, one of the best horror sequels ever made, and a more than acceptable stand-alone film.",Halloween II

1) John Carpenter's enhanced ""Halloween"" original score is super-creepy (in a good way). His / Alan Howarth's score adds a lot to the creepy, looming sense of doom.2) More of what you expect & want in a ""slasher film""...more gruesome death scenes. The suspense / lack of gore of the first Halloween film worked perfectly for that film. In this one, you see more of what makes Michael a true homicidal maniac. Some very fresh / original killings.3) Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis still doing a great job knowing what a real monster Michael is.What is not done well is some editing / filming mistakes. Certain things make no sense, or were edited very poorly.Overall, there is a lot to like. Michael is even more of a monster here. In a slasher film, we want our homicidal maniacs to to be very brutal, and creative in killing their victims. And if you listen to the background music, it adds to, not distracts from the terror.Look past the mistakes and sometimes poor editing.

I now own Shout Factories Blu ray version of it, and it is excellent. It also has some great bonus features with it. They catch up with the director and a handful of the cast members, kind of weird as to how old they look now. If Halloween 2 was ever re-released in the theaters, I would go see it to see what it looks like on the big screen. I was too young to see it back in 1981.

I like this particular film more than the first. I guess it's narrow hallway shots and good pacing made an everlasting impact on me, because I adore it. I think this film was, especially well defined, being a sequel. It was all the rest that followed, that remind me that the film industry is just as this film states, a nightmare that ain't over 'til it's over!

355,thomasellery,Michael has had a Redbull,8,5 October 2021,"Firstly let's wave goodbye to those who only like horror when it's critically acclaimed, we are in sequel territory now - it's slasher time.The seconds after the first one ended continuation works a charm. Yes the pace is completely different, but we've just had a slow burning build up in the first one, it would seem odd to slow it right back down again now the killings have started and Michael is going to agree, he's clearly had a red bull and can't stop with stabbing.It doesn't matter there's so many minor characters that they're only given a scene or two before they're bumped off. They're slasher cattle, we need them for kills not depth.The kills themselves are entertainingly cheap 80's splatter, a quick flick of red paint and a glimpse of Michael's weapon of choice and you're done. Although we've still got some iconic franchise deaths here, (the clog dropping nurse 'v' scalpel got a very big nod in H20).Donald is also on top form here as Dr Loomis, shouting at everyone like he's completely lost patience with them all. Jamie is still in screaming survivor mode and I really like the fact Marion Chambers is back with a bigger role which Nancy Stephens does a great job playing her.Maybe it's the 80's nostalgia of it all that makes me love this film as a sequel or maybe it's because this is one of the first slasher sequels and it's setting the rules ooooorrrr maybe it's just because it's an overall easy to watch good slasher in its own right.I'm deducting points for the emptiest hospital in history, Michael's mask shrinking in the tumble dryer making him look more pinheaded than Pinhead and the injustice for the slasher film legend that is Ben Tramer. (Plus a bit of crap acting from some of the supporting cast, but it's part of the charm really).Watch it - it's cheesy but great, totally 80's but not dated, it has a plot amongst the kills and if you like to smoke a little 420 it's going to make the film better and not take you into the bit freaked out zone.",Halloween II
356,leslie_rulz08,Gory follow-up full of flaws,4,27 June 2009,"From the director of The Witches of Eastwick (1992), The Birds II: Land's End (1994) & the underrated Halloween Resurrection (2002).Halloween II continues exactly where the original left off. Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasence) has shot Michael Myres 6 times & Laurie Strode (Scream Queen Jamie Lee Curtis) is going to hospital. But, Michael has left the spot where he landed after the shooting & is loose on the streets of Haddonfield-again. While Myres is on his way to the hospital to get to Jamie, Loomis & friends are failing to capture the shape.Nothing much or original going on in the plot. Just a continuation of the first. Still, the movie is really tense-especially how the film is set up. There are really suspenseful chase scenes unlike the original Halloween (1978) which was a really good horror film but just isn't scary or suspenseful. Just well-made. Halloween II however, manages to do what the first part couldn't. It is full of suspense. But unlike number 1, there is no time for character development so none of the characters are likable enough to root for. The once likable Laurie Strode is now a weak Jason Voorhees victim who just won't talk. Speaking of Jason aka villain in Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981), Halloween II (1981) is better in many ways but there is no time to get into that. This flick is clichéd & predictable as hell.(:) a combo which ruins any horror movie. Also this pic gives Michael Myres backstory which ruined the mystery & horror of the character. It also ruined Laurie Strodes character & the development of the plot in the first movie. I mean the rampage in the original was obviously random.But what this film does have is descent acting, a good score & good direction by first time director Rick Rosenthal. The Halloween song is fractured kind of but i like the original better. Another thing is that this movie introduced the Mr.Sandman song into the series. That song goes with the film very well despite the fact that one doesn't relate to the other. But those things don't save me giving this movie 2 out of 5 stars.At least we get some effective death scenes & some good gore. Unlike the first, Halloween II has a gallons of gore. The gore in the original is underrated. The gore in this one is overrated. Memorable death scene involves a bath tub.Bad slasher sequel which is awful compared the classic original.",Halloween II

358,theshape-13,Better than expected sequel!,7,16 March 2006,"HALLOWEEN II is one of the horror genre's better sequels. What is unique about this sequel is that it starts up right where the original HALLOWEEN ends - something that has not been done since 1935's BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. We get the last few minutes of the original, with Dr Loomis firing 6 slugs into Michael Myers, who proceeds to plunge from the balcony of the home where Laurie Strode was babysitting. One moment, Michael is there; the next - gone!!! It is at this point that the audience gets what the movie's tag promises - ""More of the Night HE Came Home""! Michael is up and about, bullet-riddled and driven to finish off the one that got away - Laurie Strode! Laurie is whisked off to Haddonfield Memorial while Dr. Loomis is still in hot pursuit of the masked killer. Michael eventually finds his target, but not without leaving a trail of bodies. There is a method to Michael's madness, but I won't tell - you have to see the film for yourself.HALLOWEEN II, while filmed 3 years later than its predecessor, has most of the same production team that worked on the original. While it lacks some of the suspense and tension of the first film, it more or less makes up for that with a fair amount of gore. While terror and suspense were OK in 1978, it was now the 1980s. Due in part to Friday THE 13TH's success, movie audiences now wanted gore FX along with the death scenes. This movie certainly has them...All in all, I like HALLOWEEN II. It really is one of the better slasher sequels out there.",Halloween II
359,ajmayowski,BETTER than the first!,8,17 February 2003,"Michale Myers terrorizes in a hospital- a closed environment with nowhere to run. Now we can't yell at Laurie for not going out the door, so it makes it a scarier flick. This was, coincidentally, the last good Halloween movie.",Halloween II
360,antoinecatry,The only worthy sequel in the series,6,15 May 2010,"Some pornographers say what's important in an X movie is to see people shagging, no matter what the lame and botchy script. In horror films, we could as well state that the only thing that matters is to see blood and gore, with a bit of fear. I don't agree, especially in the case of a franchise. The first ingredient, in my opinion, is a solid pretext to justify the persistence of the killer. Unlike Freddy or Jason, Michael Myers has always been known for its relative – biological at least – humanity: he's no living dead or malevolent spirit of some kind. So, as long as he's not been decapitated, burned or deaths of the likes, his toughness and refusal to die can still be believed at the end of Halloween; although it can't at the end of H2. Plus, H2 is in direct continuity to Halloween, which is extremely rare in films, no ellipse at all. What matters also, in this solid bond of continuity, is to give the audience something more than a trendy bogeyman, strong characters, rough victims who are inclined to survive better than others and offer some strong resistance to the killer – not the only heroes in horror movies, also in my opinion. Jamie Lee Curtis/Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasence/Dr Loomis are those very characters and their part bring some enjoyment in the film. Another thing deserves a positive remark: the pertinence of the title, it still happens on Halloween night, kids go on with their pranks, ignoring that something serious looms over their head. In modern horror films, the presence of a prankster disguised as the killer, or always making jokes at such a point that nobody believes him when he is actually being murdered, is a recurrence. H2 does not suffer from that type of cliché yet, well, apart from poor Ben Tramer, only evoked in the lines of the first Halloween, being accidentally confused with Myers and dead of combustion after a car rushed to him. On Halloween again, Loomis explains rituals about Samhain in the later part of the film, interesting and a bit creepy, not like the occult nonsense in H6, what a disastrous way to leave the world for Donald Pleasence! Finally, in some ways, I value this film because it still bears the mark of Carpenter in the music score and in the editing. At the pantheon of horror directors sit very few people : Carpenter, Craven, Hooper, Romero (all of them have initiated something of their own: Freddy, Leatherface, Myers and the zombies); among the many minor directors (one of them being called Miner! Sorry for the lame pun) Rick Rosenthal almost reaches the talent of the masters, even if Halloween Resurrection has disappointed me. In spite of the relationship between Laurie ans Myers being slightly revealed, the shroud of mystery (another fundamental element of horror) remains about Myers'compulsiveness for rampage, some of the murders in the films are classics and the suspense still works. It is useless to compare H2 to its predecessor because they are not the same of their kind, nevertheless, what they share: they can be both watched with an equal pleasure. After H2, the insistence on pursuing the sequels has so far only resulted in tasteless directions and very forgettable stories.",Halloween II
361,brenleyman,"A very good sequel, or a continuation if you prefer",10,29 October 2005,"I think this is the best sequel and has a lot of merit. We are of course introduced to many secrets, such as why Michael Myers is so interested in killing Laurie Strode. It picks up right where the other one left off, with Loomis chasing after Myers, and Laurie being taken to the hospital. Michael finds her soon after, and stalks her through the hospital. My favorite part was when Michael was walking through the parking lot, and the trademark music is playing. The end was fabulous, with Loomis blowing up the anesthetic room, and severely wounding Michael. This film is definitely worth seeing, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good scare.",Halloween II
362,guszak,"It Pales in Comparison to the First, But.....",7,9 July 2019,"Look, this is not nearly as good as the first Halloween, few films if any are. However, this film still has some of the components of the first film, primarily the main two actors. No, it was not directed by Carpenter and that shows. It also lacks the story and depth of the first film, but because it was not that far removed from the original in time, you are allowed to escape into the story. In the end, what make this film pretty good, is it is not nearly as bad as all of the other Halloween films that followed, each of which, terrible.",Halloween II
363,therealhumanghost,Solid sequel,8,28 August 2018,The film follows up were the last film left off and this film mostly take place in a hospital but all I'm going to say is when I first watched it I thought to my self that was a good sequel I have just rewatched it and it is as good as the original but if you want to watch it you have to watch the first one first,Halloween II

I love horror (and suspense) and this is one of the best horror films ever made. Yes, I said horror NOT GORE! I agree with the idea of suspense ( it is the quickest path to fear) and this movie plays it to the hilt!I don't want to give away too many details of the story, but I will say that it is a continuation of the first film, with Michael hunting Laurie through long, dark hallways in what seems to be a deserted hospital. The absolute silence of Michael gives me chills every time I watch it, along with the helplessness of Laurie as her fate seems to be sealed.If you want a good scare, see this film.

Most of the time sequels never live up to the original, but this proves with the right idea and a great story a sequel can be great. Starting up right where the first left off was a great idea. Using a Hospital for Micheal to run around and slaughter people was good idea, I mean Hospitals are scary anyway. Hats off to everyone involved in this movie, you did a great job. Great series also!!",Halloween II
366,nickbassett1981,Its a cracker!!,7,3 June 2004,"Like some of the other reviewers, i agree that it is best to see this installment as an extension of the first film.On reception, i am sure it could not have even compared to the original's suspense building tension and camera work. Afetrall, by the time that the sequel had been released we had also been given the Friday 13th saga and so it was becoming a bit commonplace. Lookin back in retrospect though, we are able to see that the two fit together nicely, the sequel in some ways even going to surpass some of its predecessors features..The body count for example is a lot higher so those of you who like their slashers to have lots of inventive and fun death scenes, you will enjoy!!
death by scalding swimming pool? Check! death by blood being drained through a drip? Check! death by syringe in the eye? CheckOuch, ouch and double ouch!!  The explanation of the relationship between Michael and Laurie is very credible yet sad but the performances of the main characters are strong. Sure, some of the bit players tend to read their lines as if they are porn stars but we dont mind that because it is a staple ingredient of a horror film..you need the cheesy boys and girls who get naked and then die horrible deaths (see swimming pool reference above). The only thing i really wish was that you could feel a little more involved with some of the doctors and nurse because half the time you are just waiting for em to peg it. With films such as Scream, teh secondary characters are developed as much as the leading roles..and it makes tehir deaths even more poignant. Also, how did Jimmy actually die in this film? can somebody please answer me that question!!?Overall a good sequel, that is still enjoyable to watch!",Halloween II
367,cmoitze,Brilliant sequel,10,20 October 2011,"Halloween 2 begins from where Halloween ends. Michael has seemingly disappeared after being shot 6 times at point blank range and falling off a balcony. It is a race against time to find him, before he kills again. Laurie is transported to the Haddonfield hospital, but she is not safe from Micheal, as he pursues her to the hospital. This movie is an absolute gem of a sequel, and in my opinion is as good as the first installment. The theme music has been revamped, with creepy results. The atmosphere is electric, with some lovely shots of Michael suddenly appearing in the rear view mirror of a car, or under a light with an accompanying musical sting. This movie moves at a quicker pace than It's predecessor, and has a quirky array of characters. Special mention must go to Bud the paramedic and his girlfriend, nurse Karen,and that wonderful hot tub scene. I actually found this even scarier than the first installment, as this portrays Michael as more supernatural and mysterious, who seems indestructible. The hospital was a great setting, with all it's dark corridors and stair wells. Donald Pleasance is once again great as Dr Loomis and plays it with total conviction. An ideal way to watch this, is straight after the first Halloween, for a double dose of mayhem. This is a classic, 10 out of 10.",Halloween II
368,savagerox-39160,A good follow up to a classic,7,17 October 2021,"Picking up where the last one left off. I've seen slightly different variations of this movie and I like the version where two people survive the night. The toned down violence is more ""true"" to the original and actually works better in my opinion. The rumor was that studio heads pushed for more violence and John Carpenter was brought in to reshoot some scenes.This sequel has similar pacing to the original and the look and motion of Michael Myers works unlike any of the subsequent releases where no one really cares about details like that. Definitely one of the better films in this franchise. Scarier than the faster Michael Myers in the sequels. It's like in the later ones Myers has a schedule to keep and has to stalk and kill as many people as possible in the 90 minute time frame.",Halloween II
369,louiecabluie,Pretty good sequel to a classic,6,16 March 2021,"Pros: good kills, good score, dr loomis, it's paced really well, awesome ending.Cons: not scary at all, it's a bit simple(mixed), Michael Myers as a character is great, but the Portrayal of him is a bit robotic and stiff,Overall it's a B or 3.25/5",Halloween II
370,taylormayes,entertaining through out,9,16 October 2021,A much better follow up to Halloween. Very enjoyable film. If you prefer scarcer slower films than you will like the first more but for me this work much better.,Halloween II
371,Verdugo85,Good sequel but predictable,8,18 May 2018,"Halloween II continues exactly right where the original left off on October 31st 1978. Dr. Loomis fires six shots at Michael, knocking him off the balcony but when Loomis check for Michael's body, he's gone. Where did he go? Michael is still alive, bleeding and roaming around the area. Loomis and sheriff Brackett are all over town searching for Michael while Laurie is being taken to Haddonfield Memorial hospital to treat her injuries in which, of course, Michael follows her there and kills the hospital staffs one by one. Ok, this is a good sequel with a simple plot. Could it have been better? Of course. There are key elements that the original had for example, the first person camera view when Michael is walking and you can hear his heavy breathing. This sequel has a bigger budget than original that features higher body count, gore and nudity. Halloween II was intended to be the last Halloween film to revolve around the story of Michael Myers and Haddonfield because John Carpenter's intention for the sequels was to make an anthology series (Halloween III was the first). He didnt want to do a follow up to the original but was convinced to do the script and produce it with Debra Hill.-Laurie doesnt do much in this film. All she does is sleep in the hospital and runaway from Michael. There are alternate scenes that aired on tv that showed Laurie having more screentime and speaking..-Dr. Loomis determination in finding Michael indirectly causes the death of a teenager named Ben Tramer (Laurie's crush in the original film but never seen) because he mistook him for Michael since Ben's Halloween costume/mask resembled Myers, why is this guy even dressed like Myers?? Whatever..-Sheriff Brackett is in the film shortly and all he does is tell Loomis ""you let him out"", holding Loomis responsible for Michael running loose in Haddonfield. When Bracket receives the bad news about the death of his daughter Annie from the original, he again, angrily tells Loomis ""YOU LET HIM OUT!!"" Loomis had told him from the very beginning (since the original) that he fought to keep Michael locked up because he knew Michael was evil. Anyways, Brackett goes home to tell his wife the bad news and leaves his deputy Gary Hunt in charge of the manhunt with Loomis helping him..-Michael Myers has more screentime than the original. Stuntman Dick Warlock plays Michael Myers, he's shorter than Nick Castle who played Myers in the original. Warlock isnt bad but he's short. His version of Michael is walks too damn slow and very robotic/zombish with no energy, nothing like Nick Castle. Michael's mask is the same as the original according to Debra Hill but it looks different (pale yellowish dirty, blond/reddish hair) they could've retouched it to look pure white and dark brown hair like the original to make it consistent with this sequel. Michael's outfit looks small on him and tight, the length of his pants are up to his ankles and he wear lifts on his boots, wtf?? He just looked funny. -The hospital setting is fine but why was it so dark? Was Laurie the only patient in that big hospital? There were babies but there was no other patient besides Laurie..-I've noticed something funny, this film has stock footage. When Michael is first shown on the hospital camera walking in the hallway. This same camera footage is shown again later on but extended when one of the nurse is looking for the security guard. -Another funny thing I noticed is that Michael walks in the same corridor that leads to the operating room (where he blows up at the end) like three times. First, when he's first seen walking with the scalpel. Second, when he's looking for Laurie after he discovers that she wasnt in her room. And third, when he chases Loomis and Laurie to the operating room you can see there was no back way out in the section of the hospital so how did Michael appeared to be walking in the hallway from that section on the his ""second"" run?-I dont like the Carpenter/Alan Howarth mixed gothic version of the Halloween theme. I prefer the original all the way. Michael is after Laurie because she's his younger sister, thats fine, fun but I prefer that they werent related. Michael is just an evil force wanting to kill her because she got away in the original. I also didnt like that ridiculous ""Mr Sandman"" song, it doesnt fit the film, whats the point of that song?Overall, Halloween II is a good, fun sequel but predictable, not scary and not suspenseful like the original. Its just a generic horror/slasher sequel like Jaws 2 and Friday The 13th Part 2.",Halloween II

373,Sham33,The best of the Myers Sequels,8,14 January 2008,"Great sequel. That's all I can say! Michael Myers looks even more brutal than in the original. Halloween (1978) is my favorite horror movie of all time and it's great to see how they come up with this sequel. The acting is brilliant: Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasant are some of the best actors ever. The score is again composed by John Carpenter. The thing that really made me think a lot is that Rick Rosenthal directed the best and the worst Halloween sequel: Halloween II and Halloween Resurrection. Weird. Maybe Carpenter had a lot to do in this movie.I also liked the other sequels, this is by far the best of all. Period. 10/10",Halloween II

Laurie is took to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, while the victims of Michael in the first are carted away.  Michael finds a victim on the way to the hospital looking for Laurie where he finds many victims. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brackett and Dr. Loomis are looking for Michael.

But unlike the original ""Halloween"", ""Halloween II"" does not stand the test of time.Michael Myers is still the most frightening figure in horror movie history, and when he is on the screen the thrill is still there.  There are some classic moments here when he is on the prowl.But the hospital characters are obnoxious and you don't care if they end up dead.  The suspense is lacking, and in its place is gore.  Instead of building the fear, Myers uses different hospital instruments to do his unique handywork.Unfortunately, ""Halloween II"" forgot the tension and suspense that made the original so great.  Instead, it follows the same formula that the knock-offs like ""Friday the 13th did"": forget suspense, give them gore!They forgot to make this film scary.RATING 6/10",Halloween II

378,fritz_fraugman,Awesome but inferior follow up to the classic original,7,11 May 2009,"After a recap of the original's climax, a camera POV reveals a Michael Myers randomly stalking through neighborhood while breaking news of his murder spree and the dead bodies at the Wallace house. The citizens of Haddonfield are unrealistically accommodating, kitchen doors are wide open and front doors remain unlocked.Dr Loomis and Sheriff Brackett are at odds about Loomis' claims he emptied his revolver into The Shape's heart. Laurie Strode is admitted to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital. Breaking news from the radio belonging to a late night Halloween stroller alerts Michael Myers to this fact and the lunatic psycho killer makes a B-line to the hospital.At the hospital, Laurie Strode resists being medicated and meets the older brother of one her friends Jimmy an EMT that delivered her to the hospital.Loomis and Brackett spot a suspicious trick r treater in similar dress to Michael Myers, while trying to apprehend him he is hit by another patrol car that collides into a parked van and ignites the van's gas tank engulfing the suspect in flames. Sheriff Bracketts learns one of the murder victims is his daughter, Anne. Upon identification at the murder scene, Brackett says he must leave he wants to break the tragic news to his wife himself before anyone else and Deputy Hunt further encourages him to go home for the remainder of the evening to comfort her. Now Loomis is under Hunt's care, they learn from two youths their friend Ben Kramer is missing that he was highly intoxicated and was wearing a mask. Charred remains at the morgue is positively IDed.With the breaking news of the babysitter murders and the escaped lunatic from Smith's Grove Sanitarium, causes a stone and bottle hurtling mob to surround the abandoned Myers house. Loomis and Hunt have another lead with a break-in at the elementary school they discover a drawing of another family and ""Samhain"" written in blood on the chalkboard where the story leads into suggestions of Druidism and occultism involving Samhain the end of Summer. At this moment, Nurse Chambers (the survivor of Michael's escape the night before) arrives under Marshall escort with orders to bring Dr Loomis back to Smith's Grove Sanitarium.Meanwhile bodies are piling up quickly in the hospital with a wandering drugged Laurie Strode one step ahead of meeting her nightmare. Nurse Chambers decides to drop a bomb on Loomis giving him information from closed files that Laurie Strode is Michael's younger sister adopted by the Strodes after their parents died. Loomis commandeers the vehicle by pulling a revolver on the Marshall and ordering him to take them all back to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital.Director Rick Rosenthal makes excellent use of backgrounds with open doorways and hallways, revealing Michael Myers stealthily creeping behind the turned backs of unaware victims i.e. the kitchen of the elderly couple, exiting and entering rooms in the hospital hall beyond the nurse's station.There are few gem scares during the hospital chase that made me want to bite my nails to the bone when Laurie Strode barely manages to escape the blade end of her brother's relentless pursuit. Quite effective. This is probably Jamie Lee Curtis finest Scream Queen moment Laurie Strode is quite beat up and drugged up in this slammed up sequel.It is this very film that inspired the inhumanly strong invincible killers in slasher movies. Just observe how Michael Myers can survive a barrage of bullets even to the skull, smash through shatter proof security doors like plate glass windows, and momentarily walk away from a raging inferno. Halloween 2 is the mold that created Jason Voorhees IMHO.Avoid the Producer's Cut/Television Version at all costs. It stinks.Theatrical Cut 7/10 Producer's Cut 4/10",Halloween II
379,jjpurwitsky,The Halloween Saga: Halloween II,7,7 July 2012,"Halloween was a huge box office hit. It made 47 million (157 million adjusted for inflation) on a very low budget and had audiences jumping in their seats time and time again. It was well reviewed and it brought on a slew of imitators that performed well and helped to start a new genre of horror: the slasher film. Movies like Happy Birthday to Me and Prom Night (also starting Jamie Lee Curtis) popped up in theatres and, following the same format as Halloween, brought money into the pockets of the filmmakers and fear into the hearts of the audiences.The biggest and most successful of the imitators was Friday the 13th,released two years after Halloween. Pretty much a direct copy ofHalloween, Friday the 13th followed the same formula albeit in a different setting. Set on a campground, the story involves a murder years before, a lead female, a hidden killer who stalks the victims and the use of the killer's perspective complete with the heavy breathing and killer theme music.Friday the 13th was a hit with audiences but unlike Halloween, it played poorly with critics. It focused more on gore and jump-scares than Halloween did and it racked up the body count; 11 deaths compared to Halloween's 4. A year later, a sequel to Friday the 13th followed, following the exact formula that made the first one a success, and again, audiences at it up. The Slasher film was incredibly popular and what better reason to make a sequel to the film that jump started the genre.Halloween II was released on October 30th, 1981, 3 years after the original and many slasher films later. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance returned to their roles playing Laurie Strode and Dr. Loomis respectively. John Carpenter and Debra Hill return as writers and producers but sadly Carpenter did not want to direct the sequel. Instead we get newcomer Rick Rosenthal who does an OK job of replicating Carpenter's style and technique.Taking place literally right after the first film ends, Halloween II pales in comparison to the original. It is not as tightly paced, it isn't as scary, it relies on Michael Myers jumping out of places rather than lurking in the background and it relies on gore more than scares. Halloween II seems more influenced by Friday the 13th and the other pale imitators of Halloween than Halloween itself. That's not to say the film isn't enjoyable but it just feels lack luster in comparison to the original.The film drags a little at parts, it fleshes out connections between characters that aren't really needed (and makes the masked killer less mysterious and therefore less scary), it has some over the top scenes (especially involving Dr. Loomis) and it has a new guy playing Michael Myers who unfortunately doesn't capture the menace of Nick Castle in the first one.The biggest problem with this film, as mentioned earlier, is that it borrows more from than the imitators than the original. Myers isn't really seen in the background, or moving out of blackness and into the frame. He is either right there on screen or he pops up out of nowhere. The first film really emphasized that eerie methodical unknown killer element, always having him looming in the background. He was always there but he took his time and when he killed it was effective. Here he kills and kills, again and again, over and over.The film does pick up and get significantly better in the last half hour, when it becomes Laurie vs. Michael. At this point the movie feels almost like the original as Laurie is stalked through hospital corridors. It's eerie and fun and exciting and foreboding. And when it finally ends, it wraps the story up nicely and leaves the audience satisfied. Unlike the first film there is no ambiguous ending, it finishes the story of Michael Myers, Dr. Sam Loomis and Laurie Strode and finally, like the last shot of the film, allows for the sun to let a little light into the darkness that preceded it.Film Rating: 72%Breakdown (How Halloween II scored 72%):Production Design: 8 out of 10 Cinematography: 8 out of 10 Re-playability: 7 out of 10 Originality: 5 out of 10 Costumes: 9 out of 10 Directing: 6 out of 10 Editing: 7 out of 10 Acting: 8 out of 10 Music: 8 out of 10 Script: 6 out of 10Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com",Halloween II

Good story, the acting is good, good characters, and build up suspense like the first one. It's better than most horror sequel like Friday The 13th Part 2 (I like that one), Freddy Revenge: A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 (it's okay), Ring Two (It's boring), Saw II (I like that one), and better the Halloween 2 remake (that one suck). This is the best sequel and it's worth a watch!",Halloween II
381,Movieman-154,As good as Halloween sequels get,7,8 July 1999,"This movie is as good as Halloween sequels can get. It can never beat the first Halloween, but it wasn't as BAD as H20. Jamie Lee Curtis, as usual, is terrible, and Donald Pleasance isn't as good as in the original. Dick Warlock is not as good a Shape as Nick Castle was, and the movie is a bit gory for a suspense film. On the plus side, not all the suspense has been killed, and Michael's reputation as pure evil is still pretty much the same. If you loved the original, you'll like this okay, but otherwise, it is not for you.",Halloween II

383,Heff2001,AVOID CURRENT TV CUT!! (running on Chilller a lot),5,6 June 2010,"I remember seeing a cut for television in the 90s that just had some extra footage added in. There's a cut that continues to run on Chiller that completely trashes the film. For some reason, it wasn't good enough to fill time with extra scenes added in for the hack editor that got his hands on this. Whoever it was seems to think that ever cut needs to be logical or he/she could make it better. The opening is trashed, the scene where Ben Tramer gets hit by the car has an alternate take at the end where the deputy tells Brackett about Annie and it's so overacted, it's laughable; scenes are cut into different order, many scenes that worked well (Harold's wife finding the blood on the cutting board, the security guard at the hospital getting it with the hammer, etc - ruined!). If you've seen this cut, you know what I mean. The film was 2/2.5 out of 3 to start with (but a solid enough sequel). This cut makes it a 1 star yawner. Sloppy, hacked and - sad. There's also a version of H20 floating around (Chiller/SyFy) that's equally trashed - probably by the same person. Someone take that guys Avid/Final Cut system away (LOL). As an editor, I was insulted that someone thought they could take a cut of a successful film and try to improve it; it felt like some kid got a hold of imovie and suddenly dubbed himself an editor. SyFy/Chiller should be ashamed for showing these cuts. I know they have to fill time but for Pete's sake, use discretion. I see in the trivia that someone says this sequel ""faired poorly"". Ummm. It was number 1 at the box office for several weeks in 1981, had a budget of about 2.5 mill and made 26 mill. That's a success (especially for 1981). I believe you're referring to Halloween III, which flopped at the box office. Universal decided not to produce another sequel thereafter and Trancas produced Halloween 4 - 5 (released under Galaxy Pictures).Miramax produced 6 and Dimension H20/Resurrection.",Halloween II
384,savagerocks,Halloween II delivers the Scares,7,5 September 2006,"Clearly in my opinion better than most of the sub-standard sequels that followed. I have seen an alternate version which technically is a ""director's cut"", It has all the scares but is less graphic and has some subtle differences. It was rumored that John Carpenter was brought in to re-shoot many of the sequences to make studio execs happy. This is the version we have all seen many times. The original version I like better because it's more true to the original Halloween less graphic but delivers the goods. This rarely seen version I'd rate an 8 and would love to buy it on video if it becomes available. This version also has a slightly different ending.",Halloween II
385,HairyBussy,Best Halloween sequel with Michael Myers,8,5 October 2021,John Carpenters Halloween is obviously a horror classic and I could see why people would have a problem with any sequels to it because it ends perfectly with all of micheals mystery and dignity still intact of course all of this would later be lost in later installments but for me this is the one true Halloween sequel and the only one worth watching with Micheal Myers in. It Season of the Witch is probably my favorite Halloween sequel but of course doesn't feature the shape this movie pretty much captures the same vibe of the first film perfectly mainly do to the fact both John Carpenter and Debra Hill had a huge part in getting this film made the setting in the hospital is cool Dick Warlock gives an amazing performance as Micheal Myers I don't get the hate on his performance he was the last creepy micheal and the last Micheal Myers with an actual good looking mask the whole part where Laurie shoots micheals eyes out and is trying to stab her with the scalpel while blinded is an amazing scene and personally my favorite part of probably the entire franchise the movie definitely ups the violence in this film where the first one it was more left up to your imagination on what happens but I thought it was a nice change to actually see micheal kill people in cool ways overall one of the best horror sequels out there and always fun to watch in the fall.,Halloween II
386,vooheesv33,Halloween 2,9,17 September 2010,"Great setting, great story, and great suspense.The Halloween movies are not your typical movie until they hit Halloween Resurrection.The setting was a great idea, a hospital. When Michael Myers follows Laurie Strode to the hospital and the story just goes on until shes left for dead with her and Michael Myers in the hospital. The Story was great. It could easily been one movie, the first and second movie morphed together. The second one starts with the last scene of the original Halloween. Great from the 1st scene to the last.The suspense of Halloween 2 was scary. You never knew what could happen at moments.",Halloween II
387,jeff934,A perfect Sequal,10,20 July 2004,This instalment starts where the orignal ended Laurie Strode is taken to the hospital with injuries and Micheal Myers has 6 bullets in him and somehow lived. Now hes stalking the neighborhood on his way to find his sister both Dr. Loomis and the Sherif is searching desperately to find him. It's later revealed that Micheal is the Brother to Laurie Strode. that she was put up for addoption by her birth parents so she could be saved. It didn't work. Micheal later gets to the hospital and once again Laurie must defend herself from him. At the end Micheal gets his eyes shot out by Laurie and than the hospital gets blown up after Laurie gets out I won't say much more but I give this movie a 10/10 for it being a sequal.,Halloween II
388,tyhemp-2,The perfect setting....,10,13 November 1999,"Director Rick Rosenthal set up the perfect setting for Michael Myers in Halloween II.  The empty halls, the limited number of staff members willing to work on Halloween.For some reason even the cast is intriguing.  You almost think that ** one of the nurses, is going to survive since she is in the movie almost until the end.  The only thing I would suggest to the director is next time he should have more informative dialogue so we can at least keep track of the characters.  They pretty much all die, or disappear, at once.  Overall I give it a 9/10.  It's a classic just like the first one.",Halloween II

It is scary, great and fantastic, it is set on the same night as the original and starts straight where the first finished, a great movie but take time getting into, but the climax at the end wont let you go untill it is over.This time Michaels first vitim is put into a hospital after her injuries and ordeal of michael, she was lucky to escape once, but can she escape again?Laurie is now recovering in a hospital, so Michael just walks in and starts butchering an killing nurses to get to his sister, a great movie that shouldnt be missed!When watching this movie you can feel what it would be like to be there, just in a hospital and people are being killed by an unstoppable killing machine, so this is a movie you wont forget when you have seen it!Also this movie has the best halloween theme of them all!9/10 comes very close to a 10! very but i cant say the movie is better than H20 or the first so if you buy or rent this get the Laurie legasy as well (halloween 1,2, h20 and resurrection when it is released)",Halloween II
391,maryann_blair,A good horror sequel,8,1 June 2013,"This sequel to Halloween was really good and entertaining in my Halloween film book. This should have been the last Halloween in the series but no there was a 4rth, 5th, and 6th. Although i liked the others as well but not better than this one and the first. I liked the music gore and the part were myers chases Lorie strode and they fight. Though it was weird when his eyes were bleeding and he swinged the knife several times in a row. I really liked this and wished it could be the end of it but it is OK i know it would be sad to miss this classic horror. Bye and my rating 8 out of 10 for this fantastic gory and grateful sequel. Bye",Halloween II
392,sblair80,A solid follow up the Carpenter Classic,6,28 January 2008,"Halloween II takes you deeper into the world of Hadonfeild and Michael Myers. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance reprise their rolls as Lori Strode and Dr. Loomis to provide great continuity that carries over from the original.In the sequel Dr. Loomis becomes more obsessed with finding Myers after the deranged killer survives Loomis' first onslaught that was the climatic finish to the original Halloween. With Lori now in the apparent safety of Hadonfield Memorial Hospital, Michael begins a relentless and murderous pursuit to find her. Why is Michael so intent on young Lori and can Dr. Loomis finally bring an end to ""the night that he came home""? Held back only by a change of director and slightly odd reprise of the originals classic score, Halloween II is great not just for fans of the series but entertaining for the casual horror/thriller movie buff.",Halloween II
393,powersd-48281,One of the better movies in the series,7,1 November 2018,"Halloween II picks up right where Halloween left off. Michael is back, and he's almost as scary as he was before. The only thing that makes him less scary is the fact that all of a sudden he's Laurie Strode's brother. They just needed something to add to keep audiences interested, and that's all fine, but why give him a motive? He was way scarier when he was just murdering people for being the first people who were unlucky enough to cross his path. Anyways, the thing I really like about this one is that it picks up right where the last one ended. Same town. Same night. Same characters. And for the most part it stays true to those characters. They really tried, and it was a good effort. It doesn't quite live up to the original, but it's still scary, suspenseful, and is better than most of its competition in an era dominated by slasher flicks. Halloween II was a great way to end the series (that was the intention), but there's a lot more that could have been done.",Halloween II
394,powersd-48281,Laurie Strode is not Michael Myers' sister,7,30 November 2019,"Halloween was a tough act to follow, but they did a great job trying at least. Except for one thing. Who thought it was a good idea that Laurie Strode be made Michael Myers' sister? Well, would you believe me if I told you that the creative genius behind the original thought that it was a good idea? Quite simply put, terrible. However, the rest of the movie made a decent effort at recapturing the feels of the original. Michael Myers is still pretty scary, even if given a motive that honestly make the first movie not make any sense. Why is he going around killing random people if he has one victim in mind, and he somehow knows where she is? I don't know. Moving on. Another problem: genuinely scary moments are often shattered by a pointless jump scare. One of my favorite scenes is when Michael's chasing Laurie, and he plows right straight through the hospital doors. John Carpenter wasn't kidding when he said he wanted Michael to be a force of nature. Yeah, a hurricane apparently. The kills are some of the best of the franchise, it's creepy, Michael is still somewhat scary, and Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance deliver some great performances once more. Overall a decent albeit mostly unnecessary sequel. But I'm kind of glad that it exists. It should have ended here.",Halloween II
395,jattunit,The scariest day for us...continues....,10,17 November 2009,"Clever for the writer of the first to continue with the a story in the same night, this is perfect meaning for a sequel. Clever for them to continue the story in a different manner. The prequel changed Halloween, so does this. Fans are in for treat not a trick this time around, the night he came home just got extended.Okay, from the first we gathered that Micheal Myers is not the average serial psychotic killer but he is more of a evil spirit if you pick up the messages Loomis gives in both films, Loomis is still after Micheal at the same time. Micheal happens to stalk a particular girl Laurie, in the day and by the night she is injured, continuing the rest of the night in Haddonfield Hospital where Laurie is admitted to.John did not direct this one, but still was involved in the film by writing it and said to have directed a few sequences. John's writing is great, the main twist in the film is pretty well handled too even though it does change the view of Micheal altogether. As a sequel its great. This one is as scary and as atmospheric as the prequel. As a thriller its even better. To live up to the prequel, maybe it does letdown.The downfall to this film has to be some unwanted scenes and maybe it went on a little long, or some wanted scenes that were just not there. But the biggest drop has to be the exposure of Micheal, in the first we did not see very much of this figure but here there are way too many closeups. Director's fault.Overall, a good example of a sequel where the writers pick it up the second where the prequel ends. Neat writing. Well directed and good a thriller. Some things do leave it little short for it to be better.4 out 5 There is no Halloween without Halloween 2. Would love to 'Three Hours of when he returned home' again!",Halloween II
396,dark_nebulae2003,Halloweeny's more like it,3,2 November 2006,"OK. I would like to complain that out of all the slasher movie franchises, I FRIGGIN' HATE Halloween above them all. While although the first one was by far the superior installment of this franchise, the sequels are just plain stupid. I'll give you a few good reasons why in the review as I had to look up the definition of a spoiler before I could go onto write anymore reviews on here.One of the biggest turn offs in a film is inconsistency of logic or a lack of realism at least. Therefore, most movies --regardless of genre-- are turn offs as a rule for that reason. I mean it would be one thing if Myers was a resurrected psycho like Jason who couldn't stop, but he's clearly not. He's human like you and I, though apparently on PCP or something that makes him almost superhuman. I guess I could forgive the latter sequels more easily because that's exactly what he's supposed to be in those.Kudos: I think that this is the only slasher I've seen that's based in a hospital. No other slasher that I've seen since has had such a prop-base.Complaint: Michael Myers gets shot right between the eyes, and then gets back up and starts stalking again. I don't know if anyone else caught this, but I did and I have found that to be the BIGGEST INSULT to my intelligence. Even a crack-head on PCP would think twice about stalking when shot between the eyes! In contrast to the first film, I found this to be equal to getting stabbed in the jugular w/ a knife. OUCH! Then, they blow themselves up, kill Myers, and leave in an ambulance. Wtf? * Laughs *Whoever wrote that script ought to have been fired for stupidity! And unlike in the last film, Michael Myers, as someone else mentioned, has been reduced to nothing more than a human shark swimming after his prey in the sea of terror-struck-Haddonfield. And this is well portrayed in even Michael Myers' mannerisms as he seems somewhat stiff in contrast to the original. (I guess he hadn't gotten used to having about six slugs plugged into his major organs, already.) There are one pair of tits at least, whom are ravaged in one of the meanest scenes that I've seen in a slasher. And there is a lot of blood, though it's not excessive as some other slashers I've seen. And how Myers escapes getting his hands burnt off during this is a mystery to me? As for me, the audience, being that this was cable TV, I was bored thru this, while wondering what kind of crank that Carpenter and crew were on when they wrote this? But anyways, I gave it a 3 because I could finish it and I even fell in love w/ some of the characters; so the acting wasn't bad at all.",Halloween II
397,chrisbarker187,Very solid sequel.,5,24 October 2014,"So after John Carpenter's Halloween was so successful, they realised that fans wanted Michael Myers back for Halloween 2. And they did not disappoint. Halloween 2 takes place directly after Halloween 1, on the same night. And so Laurie is taking to the Haddonfield Memorial Clinic. Michael then hears about it, and goes to the clinic, where he begins stalking and causing havoc as he always does. The film isn't as strong as the original but it is definitely a very worthy sequel to the original classic. Michael is more brutal in this one, he is more stiff and slower but his creepiness is still there. There is much more blood and gore in this than there was in the first one, however it wasn't over the top which made it fine. All in all, Halloween 2 is a fantastic sequel to a classic horror film. Granted, it's not as good as the original, but it is definitely a strong sequel. Job well done.",Halloween II
398,nightmarelyre,A More Frigthening (And Silly) Follow-Up,7,17 April 2016,"While the original Halloween always seemed kinda over-rated and cookie cutter to me (see my review of that for more details if you want), the sequel I feel manages to be a more cohesive viewing experience that sorts out a lot of the problems I had with the first film. Well, that and it's also bloody hilarious at timesThe story of part two starts right where the first one stopped. Serial killer and metaphorical bogeyman Michael Myers have been shot by Dr. Loomis, however when he goes to look at his body he finds him to be mysteriously gone, and he and the police have to go look for him to prevent more deaths. Meanwhile, the surviving girl of the first film Laurie is taken to the hospital, though it's soon apparent Michael is also on his way there.What I noticed quickly with this one is that the pace seems much better. There are a lot of spots where not much happens still, however they feel creepier this time around as Michael is shown much less sneaking around in the shadows while we are still aware he is there somewhere, making the suspense building work better as it plays on the fear of not knowing where he is to a greater degree. Another thing is that there is stuff happening at a more regular pace in this one, which yes includes more killing and horrors this time around, but also more character interactions and more varied locations and sets, which makes it feel more forward moving than the first one.However there are still some things I feel could have been improved further in this department, as it feels some scenes would have a bigger impact if they were put in a different order. The side plot with Dr. Loomis seems to be put on pause for a big chunk of the second act which makes his chase to hunt down Michael feel less frantic than it could have, and there also could have been more focus on Laurie and her having to deal with the trauma after the events of the first movie. There is also a new character who is introduced in the Dr. Loomis side story who is also working with the psychiatric ward, however since she is introduced so late in the story she is not given a lot of character building or much to do at all, which I was disappointed by.The story itself in this one is an improvement though in my opinion. While I found the first one to be too obtuse and vague to get anything from it, more is done here to give motivation to Michael and give some hint as to why he is basically invincible, which I feel is much needed to suspend my disbelief, while still keeping a shroud of mystery around him to make him more disturbing. When scary things start happening here I also found them to be much more memorable and effective, especially one scene where Michael is walking towards someone while they desperately try and get an elevator door open, which I also appreciated.The movie also uses the concept of Halloween to much greater effect this time around. Halloween costumes play an important part of the plot development early on, while the more prominent spooky decorations on display everywhere contrasts with the real danger of Michael Myers nicely, and it all basically feels much more Halloween-esque and like it's uniquely tied to this specific holiday.There is also one other thing that made me like this one a lot: cheese. I have a soft spot for horror movies that are unintentionally funny at the same time as being legitimately scary, and I feel this movie tread that line in the same way as the first Nightmare on Elm's Street movie does. Both in the intro and outro of the movie they play an completely unfitting accapella song about the sandman, some of the kills basically turn into gallows comedy slapstick, and funniest of all an out of nowhere 80's action movie car explosion that is so over the top I half expected Arnold Schwarzenegger to pop up, all in between tense and gut-wrenching horror.Is it a perfect movie? Not at all. As mentioned the pace is still not the best, the acting isn't all that improved from the first one, depending on your opinions of what a good horror movie is the cheesy parts might be too much, and the music is also remixed in a way where it sounds more like Techno and is less spooky than it was before. However, I think it's a solid film none the less that is both entertaining and frightening to watch, has a story with more meaning and purpose, and also just feels connected to the holiday it's based on in a more substantial way. I'd recommend it for a scary movie night for sure.",Halloween II
399,redfoxagent,"wonderfully suspenseful, but terribly Gory",7,31 August 2005,"I think this film is awesome this the original, h20, and h4 are the only good films. this film was the only sequel that was intended. until the Akkad's gave the series a worse treatment than any of Michaels victims.this movie is awesome, wonderfully creative, scary, and Gory. the only thing wrong with this film is it's one of the gorier of the series. with the scolding of the naked nurse death the most violent of the series. if only they left it at stabbing and throat cutting and concentrated more on suspense. the film could have been the scariest of the series. the film had plenty of potential to stretch out the death scenes with suspense.of course why does Micheal kill everybody he meets. he's after Laurie and these people were minding there own business. or at least half of them were.still gore or no gore it still kicks ass. 7 out of 10.",Halloween II
400,KristofferAG,Might alienate some fans of the original,8,14 October 2014,"Making a sequel to an instant classic like the original Halloween movie was never going to be an easy feat, and there was probably no way they could make a sequel that would please both fans of the old and people new to the soon-to-be franchise. Halloween's ending was left completely open, and the formula used was obviously working, and the slasher/horror genre was definitely a crowd-pleaser, Friday the 13th, released the year before Halloween II, also drawing in large crowds, though with some more mixed reviews than Halloween.A higher body count and more gruesome deaths was expected, and the movie delivered on it. The most surprising (and pleasing, I might add) part for me was that the movie decided to pick up right where the original left off, instead of jumping ahead in time and coming up with some terrible excuse for Myers' return to haunt some completely new teenagers.No, instead this movie decided to take Myers, and build up his back story and character. While the plot in the original was limited to a madman who had been imprisoned for years going on a seemingly meaningless killing spree on teenagers, Halloween II gave out favorite murderer a reason for his killings. Not a very reasonable reason, but a reason nonetheless. It's revealed that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is Michael Myers' (Dick Warlock) biological sister. The seemingly random murders now seem more like Myers planning on finishing his job by killing his second sister.As was the case with Halloween, the sound track and the sound effects used in this one are absolutely amazing, and play a vital part in setting the mood for the viewers. The camera-work is still good, with long shots in dark settings, adding even more chill to the movie, as if it didn't already have enough.Pleasance is as great as ever in the role as Loomis, and though I'm seriously questioning Laurie's decision to hide instead of running from Myers, she repeats her performance from Halloween very well. The saddest thing for me is how 'The Thing' seems so much less intimidating compared to previously. On top of that, he's moved away from his precise, clean and simple killings, to more gruesome and bloody murders, which just seems to not fit the style. Sure enough, it becomes the new style for the future movies, but it certainly does take something away from the creepy aura that seemed to be emanating from Myers in the original flick.Halloween II has its flaws, there's no doubt about it, but it's still a great movie. As long as you don't go into it with your expectations too high (really shouldn't ever set your bar too high when it comes to sequels), you'll enjoy it. And I'll recommend it.",Halloween II
401,mikeisitt,An exception to the sequel's curse,7,24 August 2010,"It really is, this is a great movie, but nobody will believe it! But sequels were better back then, when will sequels become better than the original again, when? The film kicks off where the first one landed. Laurie Strode is rushed off to the hospital and Dr Loomis and the sheriff are ruthlessly hunting for Michael Myers.The traumatized Laurie is left in a deserted hospital, with everybody else out 'celebrating' Halloween. Of course, Michael escapes the clutches of Dr Loomis and heads straight for the hospital to finish what he started.In this we get terrifying chase scenes including when Laurie is almost cornered in an elevator and creative kills. Also using the same method that leaves us scared to turn around corners and open closets, and hoping the elevator gets there just in time.The great music really creates the atmosphere of pure suspense.Well done to John Carpenter for that, in some scenes I got too scared to look on, why does that never happen anymore with other movies, I wonder?",Halloween II

404,esamer,A really good sequel to a great movie,9,29 January 2016,"While Halloween 2 didn't quite have the charm of the original Halloween, it was still a really good sequel. The movie takes place immediately after the first one ends. It keeps the same vibe as the first one but with more action and felt more epic. It also had a more retro 80's vibe, obviously because it was filmed in 1981. This movie is very stylish and is really the best sequel in the series. Actually I would say this is one of the best horror sequels in general. This is when its revealed that Michael is Laurie's older brother. And the whole family dimension is set into place for the Halloween series. Some say this was wrong and that Michael should of stayed more mysteries in his intention like the original. Others say this gave an interesting edge to the series, and allowed for the halloween movies to have more sense than lets say the Friday the 13th movies. I will leave that up to you to decide. This is definitely a cult classic, and holds up on its own two feet. Something unique for a sequel, esp one that takes place directly after the first. While not being as great as the original, I still would say this is a terrific movie that anyone should watch if they enjoyed the original",Halloween II
405,Gravedigger-2,The Night he came home isn't quite over yet...,8,15 September 2000,"Spoilers:When  people said that the original Halloween will never be lived up to by any of it's sequels, I used to believe them. But I was mainly basing my opinion on the last five sequels. This one changed that. In some ways it's superior to the original. In others, it isn't. It balances out and to tell you the truth, Halloween II definitely lives up to the original.Blasphemy you say? Not really. Rick Rosenthal did a better directing job than Carpenter did on the first film. And I'll stand by that. Halloween II created a different, but still creepy atmosphere. What really helped it was the hospital setting [a perfect location for a slasher film, the clean enviroment reminded me of the original Alien], the fact that the entire movie was set at night [it's hard to pull off ""scary"" daytime scenes, though the first Halloween DID to some degree], and the new reports, thus spreading panic through all of Haddonfield. In the first Halloween, the town didn't even know Michael was there. In this one, they know very well he's in their town...somewhere...but they don't know where. To me that is just as scary.Now for the characters/acting. Again we have perfomances ranging from excellent to passable. Donald Pleasence did a great job as Loomis and I loved how he got more screentime in this movie and actually DID things instead of wandering around aimlessly. People complain of Jamie Lee Curtis's lack of screentime, but I don't. We already know Laurie from the first film and to have the movie totally center on her, like the first film, would be quite boring. Laurie was just used in the movie where she was needed most and it worked.The murder sequences in this movie were gorier and well done. The gore was used tastefully, not over the top. And a few of them were just plain brutal. The last twenty minutes of the movie were really intense and the end was spectacular.But there is one thing that heavily dragged the movie down....Laurie Strode being the second sister of Michael Myers...Lame! It really hurt this movie and even the original Halloween. It would also sow a seed that ruined the rest of the sequels [It should've ended with this one anyways]. I mean, Loomis just got through talking about pagan rituals and Samhain and suggesting that Michael was killing to satisfy his bloodlust and please the gods...then the nurse ends up spoiling the mood.However, I'm content to not let five lousy minutes spoil the viewing experience as a whole. Halloween 2 is highly recommended to those who like the most serious 8-s horror flicks because this ranks among the best of them.Loomis-Samhain isn't ghost or spirits or witches...it's the unconscious mind.",Halloween II
406,mechavsmonsters,Old Fashion Horror,7,24 November 2020,"MechavsMonsters group watched this all together. We had a blast watching something from the past still hold up over much of the junk being put out in horror.Let's get into how the second film leads us to what happened the night Jamie Lee Curtis aka Lori and Donald Pleasence aka the Doctor wonder are, after Michael Myers being shot.The film moves us into a hospital setting where Jamie Lee Curtis is being treated for her injuries. The movie plays it safe by sticking to the plot of this Michael Myers trying to kill her, but they do take it a little more off the path with a bunch of kills which I feel wasn't needed and was more to just make it have more gore, or to just have much more violence. The film itself is still fun and good.This being shot on film still holds up to this day with erie feeling and the setting. The camera work is good and the direction seems a little different, but you really have to watch both films to understand.Donald Pleasence is a awesome actor and we may never see someone like him again in film. The special efffects are ok, but the best for the movie is seeing Michael Myers walk out on fire. That was some really good pratical stuff.The script is okay, not the best, and it's always hard to follow a first film that is awesome, but that happens when some of the first people who made the film aren't invovled in the second in ceertain job positions. The film is still a classic fun movie for the October setting.We rated it a 7, because it did go off a bit to showing Michael killing all these people for no reason, some of them. It's still fun and always fun to see it when years go by and Halloween season comes. There is just nothing new like thee olds films.Once again, good old classic horror.",Halloween II
407,garycharris,The sequel John and Debra didn't want to make,7,20 October 2003,"This movie was made strictly for the money but is definitely not the worst of the series. That would be Halloween III.  But that's another story. John Carpenter and Debra Hill did not make as much money as you would think from Halloween hence when Universal asked them if they would make a sequel they did it strictly for the money. This straight from Carpenter's mouth on The Halloween 25th anniversary DVD.  However for something made just for the money it still blows many films of it's genre out of the water, including some of the critics favorites.  This installment ups the gore quotient just a bit but still not enough to turn anyone's stomach.  Standing alone this movie does just fine however the lack of caring by Carpenter and Hill shows a little bit.  Watch for a very small role by The Church Lady himself (Dana Carvey) near the midway point of the film.",Halloween II
408,sjcal75,Very Respectable Sequel But Unrealistic!,8,20 October 2005,"Well Halloween II is a very respectable sequel to its classic predecessor, and probably the scariest horror sequel ever produced. However this has to be the most unrealistic film of the Halloween series. Halloween II seems to have had a major number of flaws. To start out the window that Michael falls out of in the pre credits is different from the one he fell out of at the end of the first film. Afew minutes later Dr. Loomis claims that he shot Michael six times when it was actually a total of seven. Later on Michael makes his way to the hospital where Laurie is in her convalescence from her previous encounter from the masked fiend. The hospital is where most of the goof ups are obviously noticed. Haddonfield Memorial must be the most laid back hospital in the world. What do we notice about this hospital. Well here are a few examples: There seems to be only one doctor and he performs his duties while under the influence. Laurie might as well of had Michael work on her. There are only 4 nurses and 1 security guard. It also seems to be legal for paramedics to smoke some weed in the break room. It's no wonder why Michael was able to sneak in undetected and dispatch nearly everyone in the hospital. The hospital seems to be so quiet that two staff members get a chance to fraternize with each other in the facility's therapy tub. Well the hot tub scene may be the most memorable scene of the entire Halloween series. Yes, the actress who portrayed nurse Karen sure had a fine body for the early '80's. I wish I could work at a hospital with such a lovely nurse. It's a shame her demise had to be so gruesome and agonizing. After all her it wasn't her idea to go mess around in the hot tub. Maybe she got it that way for picking such a crude and obnoxious jerk for a boyfriend. She should've chosen Jimmy instead. While Michael is having his way at the hospital, the police and Dr. Loomis are trying to figure out where exactly Michael Myers may be. Here is where we have some more flaws. The Haddonfield Police seem to be just as inept as the medical staff at the hospital. Not only did they not question Laurie about what happened, they didn't even think about Myers being in the hospital at all. If a suspect has been shot the hospital would be an obvious choice to look, or at least inform the hospital to put out an APB as well as other locations. As we near the climax of the film Dr. Loomis is on his way back to Smith Grove due to orders from the governor. While he is in the marshal's car the nurse tells him the shocking news that Laurie Strode is Michael's sister and that's why he came home to Haddonfield. Loomis forces the Marshal to return to Haddonfield in an attempt save Laurie and stop Michael.Well this is where most of us thought the series at least with Michael Myers was officially over. Dr. Loomis decides to blow up the room that he and Laurie are hiding in due to fact the Loomis opened up the the oxygen tanks. This is when we assume that both the doctor and his seemingly supernatural patient burn to death. Obviously, when Halloween 4 comes out we learn that both of them have miraculously survived the inferno. If anybody is wondering about the third installment, it's a completely different story from the other films in the Halloween franchise. Despite the film taking place on the same night from the original film, Halloween II had it's fair share scares and suspense to make it a very respectable slasher film. For anybody who is into the old school horror icons such as Michael and Jason from the Friday the 13th films, I'd definitely recommend watching this one if you haven't seen this one yet.",Halloween II
409,James-russ98,In the shadows of the original,6,2 October 2018,"After watching the first halloween movie I kind of expected this to be the outcome of the 2nd one. It's very similar to the 1st one (which isn't a bad thing) but with a bit more blood and effects. The tweak of the music was a good touch, it let's you know that it's still Halloween but reminds you it isn't the 1st one. Nicely done classic sequel.Next stop: Halloween III",Halloween II
410,Halloween1247,A Safe Sequel,7,20 October 2015,"Halloween 2 directed by Rick Rosenthal for me does not feel like a sequel to the original film, but more of a continuation. It works great if you watch the original then this back to back because the pacing of this film speeds up and you see more of Micheal. As it's own movie... it has some issues. Picking up right where the first film ended with Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasance) shooting Michael Myers (Dick Warlock) off of a balcony then disappearing. The injured Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital to recover. Michael Myers soon arrives at the hospital and begins to kill off the hospital staff before going after Laurie. While John Carpenter did write the script, he did not return to direct as he did not want to do almost the same thing again. Rick Rosenthal has fairly unknown at the time and only got the director role because John Carpenter enjoyed one of Rosenthal's short films. While this is the better of the two Rosenthal Halloween films, this is still a flawed film.The film was pressured into adding more violence to compete with other slasher films of the time, as a result murder scenes seem to be too focused on shock value then the suspense that the first film had. The one kill that has the right kind of suspense was that leading up to the security guards death, that I think is worthy of the first film. I also prefer the scalpel-in-the-back kill as it has the right tone for Micheal Myers character, displaying his great strength. He is more then a man with a knife after all. Not that the movie doesn't have suspense. It is just not the same kind as the first film has. Halloween tries to create suspense by having Michael walking down dark hallways which is effective but not as scary. It was creepier to have Micheal out of focus in the background just watching. I will say the film's chase scene is well done and creates a very tense moment as Laurie is waiting for the elevator door to close while Micheal slowly walks toward her with a scalpel. The main character from the previous film ( Laurie ) is sadly wasted in the film as she spends most of her time lying in a bed with little to no dialogue. She really only serves as something for Micheal to chase. The only real new thing that adds to her character is that she is Micheal Myers long lost sister. This one part feels so underwritten and would leave the next movies forever problematic. This little detail now robs Micheal of his mystique and negates the message of the first movie. There was no reason to Micheal's madness! The thing that made the original scary was the randomness of it all. The best character in the film is Sam Loomis. Donald Pleasance does give a great performance ( as usual ) and does a new speech about Michael Myers to a new sheriff to bring potential new viewers up to speed. However as great as Loomis is in this film, he seems only there to kill time and only makes a difference to the film at the final act. His relationship with Michael is not even explored further which is a shame as this could have made such a difference.While being at a hospital makes sense to the plot of the film it just does not seem like a real place. There are no patients shown here and the hospital is really understaffed for some reason. There are some neat uses to the hospital setting though, such as the security cameras which show us where Michael is without always relying on the P.O.V shot too much.The film features many variations of the original theme but this time played on a synthesizer instead of a piano. The theme as grown on me, but it does not have the same effect as the first film.Although this movie does have its problems I still like it more then I should. I find Dick Warlock does a great job as the shape and that he is still quite imposing. The mask still looks good and and the way he walks levels with Nick Castle's walk. Dean Cundey returns and so it is shot very well and Rosenthal creates great suspense. Halloween 2 is well-made and better then most horror movie sequels but falls short of being what is could have been.Only recommend if you enjoyed the first film.7.3 / 10",Halloween II
411,labemaster1,3rd best in the series,8,14 February 2007,"Halloween is the best in the series. Halloween H20 comes in 2nd. And Halloween 2 comes in 3rd. That's still not bad. In fact, Halloween 2 is worth renting. Maybe even worth buying. The acting is good. The director knows what he's doing. It's hard to believe this was directed by Rick Rosthental. He also made Halloween Resurrection, which was a sad excuse for a movie. Don't see it. Anyway, in some areas, the film even improves from the original. For example, the deaths are better in this one. My favorite death was Michael's death(I'm not sure if it counts because he wakes up in Halloween 4: the Return of Michael Myers). Michael catches on fire and it barely affects him. That was awesome. If you've seen the original, rent this one as soon as possible.",Halloween II

416,antony-15,Halloween 2 Review,10,11 August 2001,"The original Halloween scared me to death when I first caught it when I was eight, so when I saw the sequel I didn't expect the film to live up to the first - How wrong I was! Okay, so the way the hospital is run is pretty ridiculous - seven doctors in a hospital THAT of that size is a bit stupid, but Michael Myers' continuation of October 31, 1978 is just as scary as the first. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are as excellent as ever, as are the rest of the cast. The movie has some cool make-up effects for the era and this film (along with Halloween (1978), Halloween 4 (1988), and Tenebrae (1982)) are the only horror films I have found truly scary. Even though the plot has been extended from Part 1 - one of the scariest things in the first - it still scary to see THAT mask, THOSE defenseless women and hear THAT scream. This is definitely one for a group of friends. Everyone that's watched it with me has screamed, jumped, or seen Michael Myers emerge from the shadows in their bedroom that night. An under-rated classic, and probably (along with Aliens) one of the only sequels that lives up to the original. Here's to Halloween 8!",Halloween II
417,dfwmiles,"The Halloween II remake is totally disappointed. Watch the original, you won't be disappointed.",1,26 October 2015,"It's 2015 and AMC is showing the remake of Halloween II(2009). I didn't even know they did a remake of #2( and that's what it is, #2) All I can say is the remake sucks. There is nobody in the remake that is a audience draw to begin with although I see some recognized 'filler' characters. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance add tangible character to this version. I can see certain movies that are geared to a newer generation but there are many movies that anyone can relate to no matter when they were born. Why ruin a good thing when it ain't broke. All the advances in computer animation are wonderful...for original ideas. As with all remakes, nothing is as good as the original. Big 2 thumbs down for the remake and totally all thumbs up for the original one. The Michael Myers Halloween theme has a big impact on this series as well as the camera techniques and special effects which are non-existent in these dumb money grabbing remakes.",Halloween II

420,Bill Slocum,"The film that made the franchise, but whose the real killer?",4,31 October 2002,"""Halloween II"" is stupid but fun. There's no getting around what the film is at heart, an teen exploitation film now older than its intended audience was back in 1981, and showing it. Back in 1981, the deal was you walked in, told the ticket girl you were older than you looked, plunked down your $3.50, and got to see some nudity and gore served up with a smattering of suspense and lots of red dye #2. Telling people you saw the film later on, the one with the needle in the eye that was so much gorier than the original ""Halloween,"" bestowed upon you the same bragging rights you might get riding the steepest rollercoaster at Great Adventure or Playland. Now however, the film feels tired, lame, a trifle slow afoot, much like its villain.Still, I've watched this movie a dozen times, and like it. Maybe it comes from the same ugly part of me that enjoys ""Pac-Man Fever"" and Charo episodes of ""The Love Boat."" But it seems to me ""Halloween II"" is genuinely entertaining, that it continues to be popular with so many people, never mind its predecessor, because it inspires some moments of real dread and plays to some elemental fears, what Dr. Loomis calls ""the darkness inside all of us."" I still remember how I soaked up every inch of the big screen searching the tree-lined shadows and darkened hospital corridors for the man in the mask. Donald Pleasance has fun with his role, and makes a vivid, offhandedly dynamic impression amid an otherwise droopy cast. There's a couple of effective scenes near the beginning involving Michael, especially one where a teenager, listening to a radio bulletin about the first batch of murders, suddenly hears a sound in the next room and wheels around in a state of compelling fright. The look on her face, as they say in the commercial, is priceless, and still gets to me. Of course, walking into the room right after is probably not a good idea, but they all do that in these types of movies, don't they?Here's a theory: ""Halloween"" was the better movie, but ""Halloween II"" made the franchise. A lot of the things we associate with ""Halloween"" came not from the first movie but here, such as the effective theme music (heard less substantially and much less suspensefully in the original), the notion of Michael as something other than human, the molasses-methodical nature of Michael's killing spree, the connection with Laurie, Dr. Loomis's signature trenchcoat, his insistence he shot Michael six times...Something about that Dr. Loomis guy bugs me. They say Halloween II is different because Michael kills more people, 12, as opposed to just five in the first one. But when you really look at it, Dr. Loomis is the real culprit. You have that poor Ben Tramer, nothing to do with Michael, whose bad luck it was to be walking down the street when Dr. Loomis's blood was up, and who was killed only because he got drunk, walked too slow, and chose to wear the wrong mask (which was nothing like Michael's, by the by, not that Dr. Kevorkian could be bothered to notice). Later Dr. Loomis forces a federal marshal to turn around (at gunpoint, no less), thus sealing another innocent's fate. Of course, there's Michael himself, roasted like a briquette in one of the worst breaches of the doctor-patient relationship in the annals of psychology. In fact, this may be a controversial comment, but if Dr. Loomis had simply waited for Laurie to get hers in the opening scene, the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital team might still be with us today. Alright, so Budd would have still been with us, too. But did we have to lose Nurse Karen? And Jill? Now, there was a hottie who did not deserve to die.I can't give this movie so much as a passing grade, but I probably will watch it again before I watch ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Chariots Of Fire,"" which won the Oscar for Best Picture the year Halloween II came out. So who am I to call Michael crazy?",Halloween II

Donald Pleasence returns in top form as Doctor Loomis the only person who knows better than anyone how dangerous the killer is.The hauntingly brilliant score that plays at the beginning of the film sets the stage for the story which takes on a darker tone, John Carpenter created and performed the music with Alan Howarth which was superb.",Halloween II

Incredible efforts were made for this to take place, immediately after the original, despite being filmed three years later.
The pacing is deliberate, but there are some good solid jumps and the kills are both inventive, for 1981, and stands out amongst the best of the series.
The musical score continues to build the tension and it feels like a Carpenter directed movie. The Dolby Stereo soundtrack, adds ambiance to the film and the surrounds add substance to the film.
The fact that the 2018 sequel, ignored key points in this story, is very disappointing, since the other films essentially built their story on this premise. This film is a must watch and is definitely a good way to celebrate the Halloween season.",Halloween II

I don't mind how they establish that Laurie is Michael's sister but a direct followup on the same night as original doesn't seem to work. I wish a little time had lapsed and they followed similar plot-builds as H1. The ending chase scene should have gone on longer, those are the best parts.

430,Voorhies,Just before it all went terribly wrong,7,5 February 1999,"Is Halloween 2 as great as the original?  No.  Is it a worthy sequel, especially compared with the subsequent installments in the series? Yes.  I mean, c'mon, there are some great scenes in here.  The car hitting the kid and exploding?  Classic cheeze.  The scene in the hot tub?  Ahh yeah baby. Mike Myers rocks people's worlds in this film.  Halloween 2 admittedly moves at a pace that is as slow as a jug of cold molasses, and has an extremely blah ending, particularly since the suspense has carried over from the ending of the first, leaving us with larger expectations.  The hospital as the main setting was a great idea, but have you ever been to a hospital that dark, and that under-staffed?  It just wasn't believable.  But, this is the horror genre, after all, and these minor points can be overlooked in the overall scheme of things.  What's more important is that the movie exudes a sense of dread, of foreboding; when we see Mike looming in the background, our hairs still prickle (after this installment, you just never quite get that feeling again, especially in the grossly overrated H20).  And of course, the death toll is staggering, and it's hard to argue with that logic.  My grade: B-",Halloween II

Halloween 2 picked up directly where the original left off.  By using the same characters and atmosphere of Halloween it succeeded as one of the few great sequels in the history of movies. It showed the aftermath of the killings in part 1.  Most of the movie takes place in a hospital as Michael Myers resumes his killing spree there.

More blood More Death More Fun... All except the last one. It's not as scary as Halloween. The music is a step up though, which really helps make this movie a lot more entertaining. It has a certain way of mixing in with the action now and really give it a scary sensation.The plot of this movie is very good. Michael is still loose and he is still looking for Laurie, who is taken to the local hospital. The town is slowly becoming informed of the brutal murders and many are scared. Laurie is in the hospital, scared, and confused of what is going on. Michael is hot on her tracks, as he makes his way through the hospital to find her on the night he came home.I gotta say its pretty well done. The mask is noticeably different, he looks a little dirty. The some scares are somewhat predictable, others are really shocking. The best scene is were he finally meets back up with Laurie.

So the film is remembered as Michael Meyers roaming around a hospital, which is pretty much true. There's also the fact that the stuntman playing Michael Meyers never really got the movement down pat. Then there's the unrealistic fact that a handful of people seem to running this multi-floored hospital. (The one thing Rob Zombie did right in his remake of Halloween II is to make the hospital sequence only part of the film.)I gave this film a pretty high rating because despite its many flaws the film seems to work. Just would have been a lot more interesting if compressed into a shorter film.",Halloween II

438,keaneye1,Sam-hain?!!!!!,3,29 October 2021,This movie barely feature a character that felt in any way written. The killing of a 17 year old in a ridiculous car crash and explosion barely seems to matter. Most people seem unaffected by a psycho killer on the loose and the deaths are ridiculous. As an Irish person I really lost interest when it came to the interpretation of Samhain (sow-n) as Sam hane. Samhain is an Irish word to celebrate the end of the summer harvest and the beginning of winter. This Celtic festival is the true origin of Halloween. Donald Pleasence says it means the devil. It doesn't. A word misappropriated by British Wiccan culture who can't even pronounce the word.,Halloween II
439,sportsman2031,scarier than the first !,7,28 February 2005,"i found this movie really scary for some reason. I liked the first Halloween film better, but i thought this one was much scarier, plus this sequel starts off right from the beginning. There were also some down sides to this movie. i found it pretty lame that he couldn't WALK ANY FASTER! he walked incredibly slow especially the scene when hes chasing Lorie in the elevator scene. i also found it was weird how there were only a total of maybe 3 or 4 nurses in that whole hospital! but all in all the movie was pretty gory, suspenseful, creepy and entertaining. i would recommend it, and its worth putting into your collection if you collect horror movies.*7/10*",Halloween II
440,Zom-Lassic,Zom Lassic's HALLOWEEN 2 review,7,1 November 2017,"The first Halloween was a classic, the ending was pretty effective, and in my opinion, it didn't need a sequel. Think of it, Halloween with that ending, nothing follows, I think that's pretty scary, but as it also goes, success always brings more, so here we have Halloween 2. It's not a bad sequel at all, but it's no where as good as the original. Plus it depends highly on bloody violence, brutal killings, which is okay sometimes, but a huge difference from the bloodless original. This one is more action packed, but not as scary. You do get more jump scares in this one, mostly done with loud music of course. I do like the new remix, John Carpenter did with the score, it sounds more techno, it's a bit stronger sounding than the original. But the movie done have some real questionable things in it, the biggest ones are, why is that hospital so empty?, why is there only one baby moving in a room filled with others in it, and wouldn't those new mothers be also in the hospital, if their babies are and many questions more. Halloween 2 is still a fun, never boring horror fest, fill with some dumb characters doing dumb things. Donald Pleansence and Jamie Lee Curtis returns, and both are still great in their roles, and Michael Myers is still a creepy dude, who has gotten a little more inventive with his killings. All in all, I like this sequel, but I didn't love it, it's still a pretty good movie for what it is, a straight forward bloody slasher film, that doesn't care about its obvious inconsistenci es, I'll still recommend it, no matter what.",Halloween II
441,acemark102,A bigger yet inferior sequel,6,1 November 2017,"Halloween II is a great example of why bigger doesn't always equal better. It has a bigger budget, a bigger cast, a wider set of locations, a higher body count, and a more complicated plot, but it just isn't as good as the original. Even though the first movie wasn't without its cheese, it still felt grounded in reality, making the existence of a seemingly unstoppable killing machine like Michael feel more threatening. When your sequel features a scene in which a man, who just so happens to be wearing the exact same getup as Myers, boiler suit and all, get briefly mistaken for him before immediately getting hit by a police car and dying in an explosion, your movie ceases to feel believable. I can buy the fact that Michael shrugged off six bullets, but this feels maybe a little too silly. The fact that the movie isn't patient enough and has the first, present-day, on-screen killing take place within the first ten minutes, as opposed to forty or so minutes in, means that there isn't enough time for suspense to be built up, making Halloween II feel more like a run-of-the-mill slasher movie where you're just waiting for another body to be added to the pile. It's predictable and it's not scary. That's not to say the movie is without its merits. Many of the shots are pretty spooky, the lighting is dark, the acting is still pretty good, and the hospital setting is interesting. The music actually works in favor of the bigger scale too, as tracks from the first movie are remade with synth instruments that lend themselves well to the bigger scenes. The final chase in the hospital is almost on-par with the one in the first movie, even if its marred by the fact that the side-characters have god-awful peripheral vision. Overall, a very uneven and lesser sequel. Ignoring my gripes, this is where I think the story of ""The Shape"" should've ended, with the following movies being anthology stories instead of the same Michael Myers stuff every time. But no. Now we have a bunch of terrible sequels, with Halloween 3, the only one that tried to be different, being unfairly hated for doing something new. ""I SHOT HIM SIX TIMES!"" out of ten.",Halloween II

443,iwoegill-89023,A Solid follow up,6,28 October 2021,"Halloween II (1981) is a solid follow up to 1978´s Halloween, but it´s definitely not better. It has a lot of the elements the first one has but doesn´t really add up.This film is much more brutal, more spooky and more Michael Myers. Yes, the one problem with the first is fixed by the sequel. Even if Michael Myers is replaced by another actor, but it´s not noticeable, cause it´s just a man that walks with a mask. Michael wanders around the hospital killing and looking for Laurie, and with John Carpenter´s music, it´s much scarier.But sadly there is not enough of Laurie Strode, she is barely in the movie. She is just bed ridden.But if you like brutal kills then this is better then the original, but for story the first one dominates and basically in everything else.",Halloween II
444,Sash5034,Good enough.,8,30 January 2011,"Right from the intro, its easy to see that this sequel won't stray too far from its roots. In this case, that's definitely a good thing. The movie is well-directed, very slick. It retains much of the same feeling and mood as the first one. The acting is good for what it is. The movie is definitely suspenseful, it doesn't rely on gore for scares.Unfortunately, the movie starts to drag during the last half hour. It turns into a long game of hide and seek, I found myself checking the time a lot during the last half hour. At that point, it also starts to use a lot of horror movie clichés, which cheapens it. If you're a Halloween fan, you should enjoy this one, especially if you're a fan of the first one. Slasher fans expecting lots of violence and sex might be disappointed with this one. This entry is definitely more old- school horror than the rest.",Halloween II
445,rochus_meijer,One of the better slasher sequels,7,23 December 2005,"This is one of the better slasher sequels I've seen. It doesn't reach near the level of the first Halloween, but it's fun nonetheless.. It starts off exactly where we left the first film, right after Loomis shoots Michael Meyers and discovers that he's gone. This film has a frightening atmosphere, especially the scenes in the hospital corridors. The plot is OK, but mostly Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence keep the film going, together with the horrifying Halloween theme, which still brings shivers to my spine. In my opinion the series should have stopped here, considering the ending. More gore than the first film, but lots of scares as well.. If you're a fan, make sure you check this one out. If not, leave this on the shelf. 6.5/10!",Halloween II
446,lenlarga,A Huge Disappointment,4,18 February 2009,"Compared to most of the other Halloween sequels, the second installment of the Michael Myers saga isn't half bad. However, it is probably the most disappointing of all the Halloween sequels. Much anticipated at the time it premiered in 1981, the movie opens up with a bang. The first ten minutes of the film, partially a reprise of the end of ""Halloween"", looks and feels almost exactly like the original. It culminates in ""the Shape"" a.k.a. Michael Myers taking the life of one more young girl in the residential areas of Haddonfield.After that, the movie takes a steady dive downward. Whereas the original was about suspense and build-up, the sequel is all about body count. The sequel doubles the number of youngsters killed from the original. And most of the stalking and killing takes place in what looks to be the most pathetic excuse for a hospital in the world: Myers lays down his butcher knife in exchange for a scalpel.By piling up the bodies, suspense is almost nonexistent. Making matters worse, the star of the show, Jamie Lee Curtis, walks around in a daze during most of the time. There are a couple of bright spots in Halloween II though: Alan Howarth's score and Lance Guest's performance as a Laurie Strode-smitten paramedic are among them.Overall, though, Carpenter and Hill should have made a much better film, given the resources they had available to them. Not until H20, made 20 years after the original, did this series serve up a worthy sequel.",Halloween II

Some of the more scarier moments - anything that doesn't take place in the hospital. The scene where Loomis chases a Michael look-a-like until the so called Michael gets nailed by a police car is cool, and the scenes outside the Myers house are great. The weakest parts of the movie, most of the stuff in the hospital, which is almost the whole film unfortunately. The hospital is so dark and understaffed it's ridculous, but at the same time a little creepy but the effect grows old after awhile.

When I watched it, I loved it. This film picks up right where the first film left off and I couldn't have been happier after the first one's ending.

Great movie and even better if you watch both of them in a row!",Halloween II
451,peterphelps-73255,You Don't Know What Death Is!,9,23 July 2019,"Let's get one thing straight - John Carpenter's Halloween didn't need a sequel. Not at all. However, if you're going to do a sequel to a movie like Halloween, one could do much worse than Halloween II.Picking up right where the original left off gives the film a sense of urgency as Michael Myers dashes off after being shot 6 times by Dr. Loomis (an unhinged Donald Pleasance) and falling off of a roof. It only takes a little while for Myers to terrorize a few more people and gain himself a weapon as he goes off in search of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in a dimestore wig) at the local hospital where they're understaffed and in need of paying their power bill.Halloween II captures the atmosphere and mood of the original film in an almost uncanny way. I'm sure that if one were to watch these films back to back, they'd never know there were a few years in between them (well, minus Curtis' dreadful wig). They connect incredibly well.This film increases the blood and guts considerably with deaths by hypodermic needle in the temple, a scalding hot hot tub drowning, a scalpel to the back, a hammer to the head, and even a character drained of all their blood. It's a pretty grisly spectacle.Unfortunately, while Halloween II does manage to capture a similar vibe as the original and give us some enthusiastically nasty death scenes, it's a bit light on character development. We're introduced to a huge bundle of nurses, doctors, and orderlies who never make much of an impact. Even worse, our heroine is drugged and/or comatose for 3/4ths of the movie, making her one of the least interesting heroines in memory. It's a realistic choice given what she went through in the last film, but it doesn't make for compelling storytelling.",Halloween II

But it just doesn't really cut it compared with it's 'same evening' companion. The slow-burn tension of the first one is gone and the overall pacing is very sluggish. But worst of all (and I realize I'm not speaking for everyone) I just think the whole explanation behind Michael's rampage, and the brother/sister link, ruin it. I'm of the school of thought that Michael Myers was much scarier when he was just a psycho in a mask getting his sick jollies. He wasn't targeting any specific protagonist to satisfy silly, obligatory plot-threads in the script. For me, this brother/sister plot-thread is better left forgotten - which means you'd have to forgo ALL the rest of 'em. Which I'm content to do.",Halloween II

The death scenes in this film were a lot more gory than the first film, i personally prefer the more atmospheric deaths ib the first film. Something that i don't like is that when it's revealed that Laurie is Michael's sister, they don't really do anything with it. They kinda just say it and move on.

The entire 'deserted hospital' scene they have going on is totally unbelievable and the death count should have been a lot bigger. Michael plays his role fine as well, but the entire hospital thing disappointed me. On a scale of 0 to 10, I give it a 7.5.",Halloween II
458,RaidonHyobanshi-1,A worthy sequel that fails to match up to the original,6,15 August 2007,"Halloween II Is this a good film? Yes, Is this as good or better than the original? Definite No No!I knew from the get go that this wouldn't or couldn't be better than the original, but I gave it a chance because of the brilliance of the first film.Let's start with the good shall we, one of the positives of this film is that it begins straight after the first film on the same night which brings us to the plot. Laurie is rushed to hospital after her ordeal with the psychopath Michael Myers, where she learns hereafter from an EMS driver Jimmy Lloyd that the man who attacked her was Michael Myers infamous for murdering her his older sister fifteen years beforehand. After this Laurie begins drifting in and out of consciousness having strange flashbacks about her adoption by the strodes and visiting an unpleasant boy in an institution. Meanwhile Dr. Loomis and Sheriff Brackett continue to search for Myers, however Brackett soon leaves for his wife after learning of his daughter's death at Myers' hands. Loomis teams up with a deputy to continue there search, meanwhile Myers has learned of Laurie's location at the Haddonfield Hospital and goes for her murdering the hospital's staff one by one. He pursues Laurie whom is eventually saved by Loomis who arrives at her side, in a final confrontation Laurie escapes while Loomis and Myers seemingly die in an explosion.The beginning of this film is very good with Michael wandering through town with the police of his tail, very reminiscent somewhat of Bride of Frankenstein however once we reach the hospital it becomes a little dull. The acting in this film is sub par, with another brilliant performance by Donald Pleasance however Jamie Lee Curtis has hardly anything to do throughout the middle of this film. The film has some great memorable scenes such as the Michael look a like scene in which a drunken teenager dressed up like myers is hit by a car in an explosion. There are quite a few good death scenes including a young orderly woman whom is dunked in boiling hot water until her skin peels of her, the film is much more gory this time round but not to over the top. The film manages to keep a level of suspense but drags in parts and this is because the hospital is just not a good setting for an entire film, the beginning and end are the only strong points in the film and with a few good scenes here and there in the middle which just manages to give us a solid slasher.Definitely worth checking out if your a fan of the first film, otherwise avoid because you will be most likely disappointed.",Halloween II

In my opinion, watching my overweight dog trying to flip himself over is more entertaining than this movie. It had the right amount of violence and terror to be considered a ""horror movie"", but it was missing something. Maybe the mask that Michael Myers bestowed upon his head ruined it. The mask looked the worst it could. It was creepy in Halloween, the original, and they even brought it back in Halloween H20, but this mask has to go. If you are looking for a ""horror"" movie, then this one should work. I just didn't enjoy the plot. Eh, ** (out of ****) would suit this movie.",Halloween II

All the elements are here for a scary movie there just not thought through enough and Rosenthal is no Carpenter. Remember this , the fact that Laurie is Michael's sister is thrown into this movie because it helped to create more motivation for Michael to still be after her . In the original film (which is the greatest horror movie ever made), he has a connection with her because they are both repressed,not because he is her brother.In the original ,Michael views Laurie as the prize of the night.I wish this one was done with a little more care or not even made at all like John Carpenter wanted. To me the way it ended in the first one was perfect,it left you in a state of mind like that was unsettlling .To bad that this one was not done with as much love as the original because it is kind of scary in way with the hospital atmosphere.Lots of blood took the place mood and atmosphere,but out of all the sequels this is the one to get.",Halloween II

Redefining the slasher era and introducing us to Michael Myers, Halloween set a new bench mark in the era of horror.In 1981, we get a ho hum attempt at a sequel that's too schlocky and aimed too much to please the fans and the current trends. So what went wrong? A lot. From the bad script to the cheesy ending, to the not so scary Michael Myers and unnecessary violence, Halloween 2 bombs on every level and proves why John Carpenter's original is the best. The movie doesn't try to do the original justice, instead it tries to set a new bar and fails miserably. I have never seen a hospital so dead of life that you could probably send a little kid in there and he'd have no problem killing off the staff. It just doesn't reach the heights the original set. And adding the fact that Michael and Laurie are siblings ruined the mystery and aura of the Bogeyman all together. A shame, as more sequels followed this and were worse.",Halloween II
462,sa420,"If Nick Castle's Myers was spooky, then Dick Warlock's was...",8,1 November 2021,"...NIGHTMARE FUEL!!!Coupled with Alan Howarth's chilly synth, Warlock's Myers comes off as a terrifying inhuman automaton.The way I interpret this Myers is that, he has just realised that he is indestructable (from being shot ""SIX TIMES!!!"" and surviving) and by the end of this movie, instead of employing full-on stealth, he is not afraid to attack people full on in the open in front of others. (Myers seemed to always attack from the rear (apart from Bob) in the first one.).Either he becomes supremely confident or I think that maybe, with each critical hit he receives, he becomes less human, his soul leaking out with his blood. I know, in Halloween Kills, there is the theory that each time Myers kills, the killing makes him less human. I disagree and think it is the amount of times he receives (otherwise) fatal injuries that allows him to trancend mortality. There is no fury or sound from this Myers...just a stone-cold, sleek Great White shark in a mask and overalls.Some genuinely chilling images of Myers (seeing his silhouette slowly stalking down a darkened hospital corridor and seeing his silhouetted shadow stood behind a hospital screen, lit from a window behind) and even seeing his eyes does not ruin this Myers.I watched this movie with a neighbour once, and they were SO terrified afterwards, they would not let me leave them until their parents got back. They thought that Myers would pop out from anywhere or everywhere.The gore scenes are nasty and clinical (the worst being a genuine needle in the arm drawing blood IMO) and the tension in the climactic chases is top-notch. Myers never breaks from a trance-like stalk but, I guess with his knack for sabotage and traps, he never needs to run after Laurie Strode, as she is pretty much trapped wherever she goes.This movie looks fantastic, which Dean Cundey's sterling photography on display and an engaging cast which features some of the loveliest looking nurses I've ever seen in one hospital.The combination of all these factors installs a genuine sense of dread as, once again, Myers slowly closes in on his target.Of all the incarnations of Michael Myers (the collaborative efforts in John Carpenter's Halloween, mostly credited to Nick Castle, definitely make that Myers the most traditionally and classically spooky) I know that a real-life encounter with Warlock's interpretation would be the one that would cause me the most panic-ridden trauma...and brown trou.",Halloween II

A lot of people consider the sequel inferior to the first film but I think it's a great companion to Halloween.  Now I don't think it's quite as good but it is by far the best of all the other sequels.  My reasons are simple.  I like the idea of picking up right where the first film left off.  I mean Michael Myers didn't exactly die in the first film.  Also, after watching the first film I found myself asking why in the world was Myers so persistently pursuing Jamie Lee Curtis.  This film answers that question.  I thought there was still a lot of scary scenes like in the original and a good score. Donald Pleasence is back as is the rest of the main cast that survived except Nick Castle as the Shape (Michael Myers).  Dick Warlock still does a great job as Myers though.  This movie is often put down but I can't see why.  Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't get as much time on the screen this time but why would she when Michael Myers is the main attraction in the Halloween movies.  I think it was good to see more of him this time around.  This movie has scenes of violence and nudity so like the original it's a great movie for teens but not for kids.  If you want to experience the Halloween series at it's best I suggest you rent Halloween, Halloween II and Halloween: H20 and watch them in that order.  You will not miss any of the story by skipping 3 through 6 because the aren't related to the three I have listed.  These three movies are the heart of the series and the others are still good horror movies but not near as good as the three involving Myers and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).  ++",Halloween II

470,randywwe412,A great continuation of the Original,9,14 April 2016,"Spoilers!The movie's opening itself is well made,opening sequence is fantastic,Michael again is menacing enough and proves that you can have a good balance in a slasher flick,is it better than The Original?No,but it's really close,soundtrack is fantastic and eerie,it's a shame critics didn't see it the way i did,sure it had more gore than it needed to,but it's still a great sequel and gets a 10 out of 10 from me,i can watch it and never get bored,props to Rick and Carpentner for making a great sequel!If they made Part 3 with Michael and finished it as a trilogy it would of been much better!Recommended,really great,you won't regret it,it's really great fun!",Halloween II
471,djdonnelly1994,More of the Night he Came home.,4,28 June 2018,"Decent sequel: Picks up right after the original ( Although the original was 1978 and the sequel was 1981 a 3 year gap) But that doesn't matter anyways on with the review. Halloween II takes place where the original ends: This time around Laurie is taken to the hospital, Dr. Loomis is still on the hunt for Michael, We find out Laurie is Michael's sister, Michael kills some of the locals, then Michael shows up at the hospital kills some of the hospital staff, Dr. Loomis shows up gets Michael in a room full gas containers, tells Laurie to leave the room, Blows the room up, Laurie ends up in an ambulance end of movie. I am not going too in-depth. It's Halloween II either you have seen it or you haven't. If you haven't? Then i suggest you go and watch it.Pros:1. Great opening with Dr. Loomis saying "" You don't know what death is!"" Then the iconic theme start playing and epic way to open the movie in my opinion.2. Creepier theme, the this time around is a little creepier than the first one.3. Cool ending you have a chase at the end with Laurie and Loomis were Laurie Shoots Michel in the eyes with a gun, they release the gas, she runs out and Loomis says "" It's time Michael."" The room full of gas blows up. Michael's body is set on fire he walks out the room falls to the ground, Laurie is in the ambulance end of movie.4. The kills are more graphic in this one compared to the original5. Great acting from Donald Pleasence & Jamie Lee Curtis once again.Cons: Not many mainly 31. Hospital was empty it could have had a bigger body count if the hospital was fuller.2. The pacing felt slow times due to not much happening.3. Some of the cast members were forgettable.Overall Halloween II is a Decent sequel and i will give it a 4 out of 5 stars. Thanks for reading this.",Halloween II

474,baniko79,The quietest hospital in the world!!!!,2,3 November 2009,"All i can say is what a pile of rubbish!!this film is so boring and has little suspense,i love the original Halloween and a few of its sequels(Hallowen 4 and H20) but this is just dull and almost as bad as Halloween Resurrection. It could have been a great follow up to a classic original but those making it were more interested on cashing in on the original than trying to make a worthy sequel. I mean Haddonfield memorial has to be the quietest hospital in the world! Where did all the staff and patients go, if only my local A&E was so quiet! and Jamie Lee Curtis does hardly anything in this movie apart from being drugged up on medication and wearing a really bad wig. The only good point i can make about this movie is that this is the only Halloween sequel where the Michael Myers mask actually looks like the original. I give this movie 2 out of 10, and that is being generous!",Halloween II

476,GrimReaper89,A Pretty Good Sequel,8,21 November 2006,"I found Halloween 2 to be pretty good due to how it continues on the same night as the 1st one. It had the same dark atmosphere(if not darker) like the 1st one. The acting was well done by Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence. This one is slightly gorier than the 1st one was and it shows a little bit more nudity.It continues off the same night where Michael Myers was shot by his doctor but the thing is after Michael Myers was shot, he disappears. Donald Pleasence goes out again to look for him while Jamie Lee Curtis is taken to a hospital because of the injuries she sustained in the original. Michael Myers then catches wind that his sister was taken to Haddonfeild Hospital and he goes after her only to kill a number of people along the way. The ending is what really makes the sequel what it is.Sidenote: My favorite scenes is the tub scene where the nurse gets her face burned off and when the other nurse gets a needle in her temple.Grade: B",Halloween II
477,startover-56297,A very overlooked sequel and an under rated masterpiece,10,30 October 2021,"I genuinely prefer Halloween II over most of the Halloween franchise sequels and the other movies themselves in general. I know that this is a really unpopular opinion among movie critics and Halloween franchise fans that this is a great movie almost as good as the original (or to me, better.) but let me explain; I think it's a really neat idea and concept that it takes place on the same night as the first movie, picking up moments after. A lot of sequels to movies don't actually do this that I'm aware of and I think it's executed quite nicely here! It actually makes it super fun to watch Halloween (1978) and then this right after.Halloween II also sees Laurie in the hospital which is actually interesting to see as it actually acknowledges what she went through that night and we see the immediate aftermath of what happened to her on that infamous night, not to mention the part near the end which has Michael chasing her throughout the hospital is very very tense and creative it actually has the viewer on edge and not completely sure of what's going to happen since Laurie is still injured quite badly and can not escape as easily as she could had she not been still injured.The acting is actually still quite spot-on, especially from Jamie Lee Curtis who reprises her role as Laurie Strode from the first film, and Donald Pleasance who once again plays Dr. Loomis and they fit their roles perfectly just like in the first movie. And Jamie does a great job at playing an injured Laurie which actually feels like it gives complications and obstacles to her survival in this film. Kind of feeling like she has a higher chance of being killed off here.The movie leaves almost no continuity errors or any changes from the previous film (excluding the twist where Laurie is revealed as Michael's long lost sister although in this movie it feels more like an addition than a change, an unneeded one of course)Not to mention the AMAZING setting and the production and cinematography in this film. It's really quite impressive that they're able to make the story feel exactly like it is taking place on the same night and year as the first movie even despite the filming being done in 1981!We get a few new characters that are pretty cool and interesting to get to know such as the male paramedic named Jimmy who is shown to have feelings for Laurie and they actually have a chemistry with each other throughout this film. Although scenes with them can sometimes drag out a little bit it's still nice to see. Plus the scenes with Jimmy on his own are also really fun to watch such as his own encounter with one of the victims of Michael Myers when searching for Laurie. The plot and character development in this film is genuinely really good as well and is really looked past when most people view this film. As for Michael Myers, although he is played by somebody different than the actors that did in the first film, Dick Warlock does an amazing job at playing his role in this film!The movie also has an amazing soundtrack that goes quite well with the atmosphere that the story develops as time goes on, though not as good as the original film it has it's moments especially when The Chordette's song Mr. Sandman plays and they manage to make it have a super creepy vibe to it given the situation and when it's used.There are tons of creative death scenes in this movie, and the ending is super satisfying here too. Of course the movie does have it's downs such as the infamous and unnecessary plot twist of Laurie being related to Michael which takes away a little bit of the creepiness factor of him due to the first movie showing he basically had no motive at all or target and it is very inaccurate and unrealistic that the hospital in this film is as deserted as the one in this plot.However I genuinely recommend this movie despite negative critic reviews and most of the Halloween franchise fans not liking it nowadays, it's truly an underrated masterpiece of a film and one of the best ones alongside Halloween (1978), Halloween (2018), Halloween H2O, Halloween III, and Halloween 4. And is actually my most favorite, and the best one, of the franchise in my opinion.",Halloween II
478,joshparker-12551,One of the best,10,2 October 2021,"Halloween 2 picks up literally moments before the end of the original Halloween and goes for the remainder of that night in the hospital. Laurie is injured and mostly left to her hospital room and it's Dr. Loomis who pursues Michael. It's spooky, the mask is scary, the music is creepy. They don't make them like this anymore. Go watch Halloween 2. You'll thank me for it.",Halloween II

I just wished that when they rereleased the DVD a couple of years ago, that it was the planned Special Edition and not the barebones one that Universal decided to release. Hopefully, they will decide to redo it and give us H2 fans the DVD we want.",Halloween II
480,coupladrinks,A worthy sequel,10,15 March 2012,"I personally am not a big fan of sequels but I always liked this one as it follows on directly from the first. Rob Zombie ruined the 2 subsequent remakes over the last couple of years. This however I liked purely because when I was a kid I was terrified of hospitals and it gave me this image of Michael Myers walking past a hospital room that ghostly white mask. The original cast once again delivered, as well as a superb supporting cast Bud, Mr Elves and as always Dr Loomis. It delivers on so many fronts and for me is still one of the best in the series although number one will always be the best. I'm intrigued to see what they do with the upcoming Halloween 3 (2012) but for now lets just revel in the classics.",Halloween II
481,thegabberman,Halloween 2 is my favorite movie of all time and an underrated sequel.,10,20 October 2020,"The story picks up directly following the events of the first Halloween making it feel like a real continuation of the original immortal classic. After Doctor Loomis shot Michael and he fell out the balcony, he was no longer there which leads to a crazy exciting game of cat and mouse between Loomis and Michael Myers and later also on Michael Myers and Laurie Strode.Director Rick Rosenthal and cinematographer Dean Cundey do a good job with capturing the feel of its predecessor. In fact Halloween 2 surpasses the original movies atmosphere in some ways. Probably because it plays in night time the entire movie giving this one a very cold and eerie atmosphere. John Carpenters score which sounds more aggressive this time may contribute to this as well. So does also the  hospital setting that gives the movie a very claustrophobic feeling.Donald Pleasence again delivered an Oscar worthy performance as Doctor Samuel Loomis. Even though he spent 15 years with Myers he still is not in control of the situation nor does he know what Michael is up to. Loomis is very hysterical in his attempts to finally put his adversary down so much that he is really having a hard time justifying his actions to others as he tries to explain himself and to warn the others about the absolutely deadly threat posed by Myers so much that he himself could wear a straight jacket anytime soon.Jamie Lee Curtis is back as Laurie Strode. She is not having as much screen time as in the original but that alright. After all it's Loomis who is the real protagonist of the first two films with Laurie being the deuteragonist. Despite her smaller role she did as good as in the first movie.But now lets talk about Michael Myers himself. This time played by Dick Warlock. Despite Warlock being the shortest actor to play Michael Myers it doesn't bother in the slightest. His slow walking, movements and postures ensure for an threatening figure and supernatural force you don't want to mess with. Seeing him creeping around on empty hallways, being one step ahead of Dr. Loomis and playing with his victims in a sadistic way, again add a lot to the atmosphere and make Michael Myers a great villain you will remember. The kills are great. Especially the bath tube kill and the syringe one. Michael is more brutal as he is in the original which obviously comes from the higher movie budget and the fact that Friday the 13th was such a huge success. You can say that this version of Michael Myers was the template for the T-800 and the T-1000 in both Terminator 1 and 2 and even Anton Chigurh from No Country for Old Men does have some little Halloween 2 Michael Myers in him.There are some minor flaws in this movie. My biggest issue with the movie is not really a flaw though but walking with an tiny scalpel is visually not as stunning as wielding a big kitchen knife. Michael should have sticked with that one. Actual flaws would be the fact that you could see Annie's eyes blink despite being dead or Michael landing on grass in H2 despite him landing on the dirt after falling down the balcony in H1. Or the one where you can see behind the set when the hospital explodes. Some may consider it a big flaw that Laurie wasn't screaming ""Help me"" right after she saw Loomis and the other but can you really think clearly when you took some medicines that daze you? I probably couldn't.Unlike some others I like the plot reveal of Michael and Laurie being sibling and I think it extended on the original plot very well. Having Michael killing for no reason may work in the original but it really is not good story telling making sequel after sequel and say: ""He does this just because..."" And Michael Myers would probably not as iconic as he is now without some good and even bad sequels.Anyway despite minor issues I call Halloween 2 my favorite movie of all time and give it a 10/10. And remember Happy Halloween Silver Shamrock.",Halloween II

Halloween was the start of it all, the stalking, the shape, the mask that originated from William shatner, etc.Halloween 2 picks up right where we left off, and honestly was amazing how they did this film that led to H3 H4 and so on. Michael Meyers isn't human, he is a evil being who lurks in the darkest parts of the shadows. If you honestly are looking at this ( or the Halloween saga as a whole) with the thought that it is not ""practical"" than you most likely will hate any horror movie in existence.MM is the shape, he is the one who walks not runs, the one who will ultimately get his prey in the end. It was filmed back in 81, so yes sometimes it is a bit cheesy, but remember that cheesy was the stepping stone that would launch the franchise into history as one of the best horror movies of all time.Do yourself a favor and watch the whole saga from Halloween all the way up to Halloween kills.

Too much killing just for for the sack of it and the use of a lot of tomato sauce.

Why did they not have him actually just fall over the balcony?",Halloween II
488,ajaxbardrick,A Blunt Blade,2,1 November 2008,"Halloween II is a shocker for all the wrong reasons. Everything that Hlwn.I did right this does wrong and shows all the signs of a project done on the cheap and rushed thru to try to capitalise on the unexpected success of the original film. Whereas in the 1st film there's a rich texture of colour to the photography enhanced by well judged lighting and colour to convey atmosphere, in this we are given a cheap looking visual quality with harsh lights that blanch any atmosphere away. The sets look cheaply made, the quasi-amateur acting element of the cast are left high & dry by a paper thin script of mindless stabbings - when even a player of the ability of Pleasence is struggling, what hope do lesser younger talents have. The tautness of the 1st film achieved by a well judged script and direction, where the menace of the threat is quite as dramatic as the intermittent rare eruptions of an attack, in this (which has 3 times the body count as the 1st film to far less effect)is replaced by a series of poorly filmed murder scenes, which aren't scary in the least. Jamie L.C. - what is that thing stuck on top of her head! - is reduced by the non-existent script from the gawkily attractive and subtle heroine of the 1st film into a monosyllabic victim with nothing to do but run away from the camera whenever the word ""Action"" is given, and Donny Pleasence, a fine actor whom John Carpenter was lucky to get for a work as poor as this, is reduced with fast diminishing returns to a series of scenes continually trying to summon up the spell that he cast in the 1st film with the "" ... the blackest eyes ... the devil's eyes"" scene.Direction - amateurish, no use of the power of the camera at all. Script - non existent (the only idea in the whole cheap charade is the word written on the school wall linking what the destructive force at the film's centre is to the pagan Celtic origins of Halloween, and how what's now a children's harmless seasonal event has a very different origin, but this intriguing concept isn't developed at all and a cheap hack'n slash job is cobbled on either side of it instead. Technical aspects - all cheaply done and lacking talent, which is odd as you would have thought that more financial investment would have been available for this than the 1st film given its success.A very poor work.",Halloween II
489,a-mcnicholas,Halloween Nostalgia,10,10 October 2010,"Wow. This movie is such a classic in when it comes to horror films. To me it screams Halloween time. It perfectly captures that Halloween night feeling. The whole movie takes place at night time as a follow up to the beginning of the day and night of the first one. It keeps that creepy slow atmospheric feel which makes it my favorite sequel of all time. It doesn't stray from the first one really at all and adds a more claustrophobic setting because of the hospital. I love the little things in this movie... it captures Halloween night with the trick or treaters to the decorations at the hospital. Also the soundtrack is amazing. It incorporates that all time classic Halloween theme with that Mr. Sandman song which adds a creepy feel to the whole movie. Its shot so wonderfully and I have so much Halloween nostalgia for this film its ridiculous. If I didn't look up the director I would have thought John Carpenter directed this no doubt. What happened Rick Rosenthal this is the best movie you've done and I can't believe the same director of this movie shot Halloween 8. That is just mind blowing because Halloween 8 as we all know is atrocious. Its such a quiet, moody film that even if it didn't use more killings and blood (which it uses a lot more of compared to the first film) this would still be considered a horror movie simply because of the way it looks sounds and is. Donald Pleasance is fantastic and the ending is a perfect way to wrap the series up. John Carpenter wrote this film with Debra Hill and intended that this be the death and demise of the kill Michael Myers. The bleeding eyes is perfect. Plus the suspense of the body coming back in the flames and then dropping and that Mr. Sandman song coming on completes the film to a T. It just makes me think of Halloween time so much! I just remember all the good times in October watching this film growing up and it still gets me to this day. One of my favorite horror movies of all time.",Halloween II

If there is anyone who saw the first and is curious about this one, I highly recommend it. I also recommend the producers cut of this movie, which is commonly found on amc around Halloween time. It has no gore, different pacing, and feels a lot like the first. It has inferior moments to the theatrical version, but the theatrical version has inferior moments to this one too, so it balances out. As an added bonus, the Blu- ray disc version will be coming out this September, currently priced at 12.99$.

492,goldberg-523-724145,The Best sequel in Halloween series,8,8 November 2012,Yes it is a sequel of the 1978 thriller HALLOWEEN. This is only Halloween in my mind that mostly keeps Carpenters ideas as he wrote this and added some shots. It picks up where the 1978 version left off and Michael Myers tracks Laurie down to the Hospital and he goes on a rampage killing in some creative ideas other than the Kitchen Knife. The only reason this gets a 8 and not a 9 is cause it shows alittle too much of Michael and less of the spooky ness of the 1st i guess they figured OK you seen him now we gonna bring him out in the open and see what fear we can still instill. Thats all well and good but that shouldn't of how they should have done it. i would have kept him more out of the lighting and made him still scary as hell. Overall i recommend this 1 too people who like Horror Movies and Slashers i own the entire Halloween series expect for the 2nd rob zombie 1 and i watch all of them still.,Halloween II

Dick Warlock recently auctioned the mask along with the Boiler Suit, Scalpel and Misses El Rod Kitchen Knife Props. And to be honest if you watch Halloween II carefully you can sort of tell it is the same one just much dirtier as I imagine there was not much call for looking after it after the first film wrapped.

I liked it a lot growing up. Granted, I always knew the original was better and this one always seemed a little slower... but I didn't realize how much slower in the head it was until I decided to really look at it for sheer curiosity sake. What I discovered was so bad I wrote and performed a review about it.There are plot holes so huge yet so passed over in the narrative that most people never notice them.

495,anthony_huwe,"Not great, but best of the Halloween sequels",7,16 August 2018,"This movie seems to get a lot of hate but, in my opinion, it's the best of the Halloween sequels. It picks up right where the original ended and continues Michael Myers' attempts to murder Jamie Lee Curtis (sporting an awful wig). This time around John Carpenter passed on directing but did some writing and eventually stepped in to direct some additional scenes. The new director does a decent job at emulating the style and feel of the first one but it does feel somewhat like a cheap imitation. I actually remember seeing this during a Halloween marathon on TV before I had even seen the original and it's always had a special place in my heart. It definately is more heavy on gore and lighter on suspense and atmosphere but it is nowhere near as dumb as later sequels. The finale is probably the best in the series (in spite of the goofy blind swinging of the scalpel) as far as giving Michael Myers a definitive death and bringing an end to him and good ol Dr. Loomis. Is it on par with the original? Definately not, but if you want to see what happens next, watch this one then pretend the series ended here.",Halloween II

My first reason for liking this film is the setting, the empty hospital gives the whole film an eery vibe, it also gives Micheal a lot of good weapons to use when it come to picking of his victims. Donald pleasance gives another solid performance as Dr Loomis.

500,Rosebud-sled,An honest re-evaluation on the 40th anniversary,8,31 October 2021,"As a self admitted ""film snob"" who predictably sings the praises of the usual suspects such as ""Citizen Kane"", ""Maltese Falcon"", ""Vertigo"" etc, I find myself in the unexpected position of gaining a new found appreciation of a sequel entry. A horror sequel from the 80's at that.Forty years to the day of its US release (Oct 30, 2021), I granted myself the permission of revisiting 1981's ""Halloween 2"", a film I had viewed and dismissed long ago. Having made a commitment to view the film with a fresh pair eyes and an open mind, I was ready to be either disappointed (again) or unexpectedly satisfied.My change of attitude towards this film can be attributed to a number of variables, the most important one being that I've learned to appreciate and respect the time period of when a film is made. A lot had changed in pop culture in the 3 years between the original 1978 film and this 1981 sequel. What worked in the late 70's wouldn't necessarily be successful in the early 80's. This sequel had to walk a tight rope and find the right balance between trying to stay stylistically true to the original yet also ensure box office success by keeping up with other masked killers. In hindsight, the error was to view the sequel through the format of the first film. It's a mistake I believe others are guilty of as well when reviewing this film. The remedy is to judge each film on its own terms: it's a question of style. One film is a thriller in the mold of Bob Clark's 1974 ""Black Christmas"" while the other is an early modern slasher, imitating its imitators as Roger Ebert put it in his review. Nonetheless there are very strong stylistic correlations to the original '78 film, not least because both films share the same cinematographer.Another element I can attribute to enjoying this film on its 40th anniversary is the gradual, higher tolerance we have all unknowingly developed for violence on screen. As someone who is decidedly anti-gore, I was surprised at not being as revolted as I once surely would have been during the few scenes that did depict extreme violence. Even ""prestige"" television dramas aren't immune to depicting once unthinkable level of violence. ""Mad Men"" had a poor soul get his foot accidentally ripped to shreds by a lawn mover while ""Boardwalk Empire"" had a man scalped alive among numerous other extremely violent incidents throughout the series. In other words, what was once off putting about this film (the gore) is no longer that much of a factor due to our collective numbness. In fact, the kill scenes are shot and staged with admirable restraint and timing, with some lasting barely a second on screen.With the gore of this film now effectively neutralized, what remains is a film deeply rich in atmosphere: Long moments of silence; empty dark corridors; crisp night exterior shots of the hospital; tight editing and the meticulous use of the revised Carpenter score all elevate it to an above average film of its kind. The first 1/3rd of the film depicts what would have realistically occurred in any town that had undergone such a murderous rampage: police cars; ambulances; shaken neighbours; news reporters; angry mobs...etc. This focus on the immediate aftermath of the initial murders is what makes the bridge to the original film a solid one. Although the sibling plot twist was and remains controversial, it is sufficiently plausible and, for this viewer at least, doesn't detract from the mystique of The Shape.With the exception of the late Donald Pleasence, acting from the rest of the cast, both in the original and the sequel, is rough around the edges. To be fair, no one expects Oscar worthy performances from such genres. Jamie Lee Curtis is given a chance to rest her vocal chords being bedridden for most of the film. The real ""star"" is of course The Shape. Played by 3-4 people at different sections in the original film, this sequel has just one stuntman behind the mask. It's a different performance from Nick Castle to be sure. One can be judgmental of Dick Warlock's walking style when compared to the agility of Castle or one can justify the slower pace by reasoning that The Shape was also getting a little tired stalking victims non stop since morning. It should be noted that Castle had also walked in the ""mummy"" style in a few key scenes in the original film. Although the wider Warlock mask contour was a thorn on my side in my initial viewing, this time I made the decision to appreciate the visual differences. If I can enjoy ""The Bride Of Frankenstein"" with Karloff looking (and acting) quite different from the 1931 ""Frankenstein"", I see no reason not to do the same here.The usage of The Chordettes ""Mr. Sandman"" both in the intro and conclusion further adds a nice ironically sinister touch to the film. ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween 2"" tell a satisfactory story about Haddonfield and it's citizens on one cursed Halloween night through two different but complimentary styles. Sometimes it can take decades for a creative piece of work to be judged on what it is rather than what the original audiences/critics expected or wanted it to be. I suspect in the ensuing decades, more and more detractors will start to re-evaluate this film.",Halloween II
501,mdolan21,Hilarious,1,13 August 2007,"Halloween was a brilliant film and made a lot of money for Carpenter. However, Halloween 11 proves the money and success of the original went to his head. Time and time again people make this mistake. For example the music. What did he do with his original synth that he composed the original music on? Did he sell it? Because it's not in this movie and that was the core ingredient in the original. Without that we wouldn't have the classic that is Halloween. At the start of Halloween 11 the movie takes up from were it left off with the original but theirs a different synth. It wasn't there on the original. Why do this? Because it's another movie? My point being, if it's not broken don't change it.",Halloween II
502,nicksexyboy36,Not as bad as people make it out to be.,10,29 June 2009,"i first saw this when i was kid and didn't think to much of it,now I'm 16 and watched it last night. It is a good sequel not great but still worthy. i liked all the parts about this movie except for the fact about the military it should had different plot to it but i guess the writer was out of ideas at the time(see trivia). in conclusion i would recommend it to people who like the Child's play series but if you haven't watched any i would advise you watch the first one before this and then watch the second film then you can watch the third installment because i guarantee you that you will enjoy it. Forget the last two the trilogy is awesome!:) 8/10",Halloween II
503,lafiya-kanemi,Spooky sequel to a masterpiece,7,27 March 2012,"Halloween II is one of the best horror sequels out there, but it comes nowhere close to accomplishing what the original did with scaring people. The film picks up minutes after Halloween ended. Michael Myers was shot six times by Dr. Loomis but he is still roaming around the town looking for somewhere to go. Laurie Strode is taken to the hospital for treatment of her injuries while Dr. Loomis is still ranting and raving about how inhuman Myers is. While overhearing a radio broadcast, Michael finds out where Laurie is and he enters the hospital killing the entire staff before chasing Laurie, again. This film lacks all of the suspense of the original and replaces it with needles in eyeballs and temples, scalding hot tub death, a strangulation, a hammer in the head, blood drained from a catheter and a scalpel in the back to name a few. This is one of the better sequels to Halloween, continuity is the key and this one pulls it off nicely. The original cast has returned as well as some new faces and the storyline is continued nicely. John Carpenter returned to produce and perform the music.",Halloween II
504,mylilproductionco,"The Least inspired of the Halloween films, but not the most unwatchable",7,15 November 2012,"Of all the Halloween films, this is by far the most uninspired, but not always the most unwatchable. There are parts to this film that I really do enjoy, and yet it doesn't really stick out to me as anything other than a clone of other more inspired work. To go back to the time that this film was made, you have to realize that I think it was the first iconic horror sequel John Carpenter had no intention of doing this film, as he felt like he had done everything that he cared to do with the first volume, but he sure didn't mind the royalties, so the film was developed at Universal, where Carpenter would spend a large part of his career in the 80's. The idea of pre-steady cam pov shots that were popular in the first film were maintained with a new sense of gore that had emerged in the genre since the release of the first film. This lead to the original pick for director (IT's Tommy Lee Wallace) leaving the film. Rick Rosenthal, who had the same agent as Carpenter, was brought in. What you end up with is a original script and concept by Carpenter that is now being handed over to a large studio, you still have Akad, an Arab film producer who had released the original that still had rights to the franchise, Rosenthal who would try and put his own stamp on it. While the story line picks up exactly where the first film left off, and it does film in the gap of how we see the story from, but it really greatly deviates from the original and I can't help but wonder if the sequels hurt the legacy of the original. The lighting and camera work in this film remind me a lot of the first film, as their aren't any immediate stylistic deviations in the film, and you never lose the sense that it occurs in middle America, as Loomis is driving around trying to find Michael after he isn't there after being shot seven times by a six shooter. Lauri is taken to the local hospital, and there seems to be two films that are taking place.Loomis, who is looking for clues that takes him to the school where he finds that Lauri Strode is Michael's sister, as well as the Samhain reference on the wall, in what appears to be blood, though it has to be asked whose blood it is as no one has been murdered at the school that I can tell. We also have the fake Michael being killed, which really doesn't serve any part of the story that I can tell other than to mock adults/law enforcement because we know better than them, but this dynamic doesn't really work for me as Loomis is a very well accepted hero, though the effect of the car crash immediately going into flames is iconic. At the very heart of this film, there are a lot of images that work, and B movie coolness that is inserted without context or consideration for tone, that are added with the Hollywood problem of throwing money at creative issues.This can be seen in the scene with the child who has the razor in his mouth at the hospital. The new older cast seems to be less interested in pretense of innocence resulting in one of my favorite minor characters in the Halloween franchise with Budd, who sings foul songs and seems to only care about sex, not in the childish sense that he is new to girls, but that he still has rules of girls he won't go after, as this is more welcome to the grown up world where sex is a common occurrence. The kills attempt to begin taking center stage as Michael eventually shows up, after a laughable jump out of the shadows first kill. Once we get to the hospital we really begin to see where all the cooks in the kitchen got their say. . Akad didn't like the razor scene so I wonder just what else was cut. I also have to say that the lighting in the hospital is still dark like the other parts of the film, so much so that even the film makers comment on it in the commentary. It is a film that felt a need to change from the original in more elaborate kills that would include an eye puncture and graphic nudity in the hot tub scene, and want to change the scenery without changing it at all. This is the film that Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't do interviews about. The movie where a character slips and falls to his death, or at least seemingly so, while the idea that they needed to include gore almost apologizes for the superior first film The ending of the film, where Michael ""dies"" is a great stunt that includes the image of him crying blood from the eye holes of his mask in front of the sister he is trying to kill after she shoots him in the eyes (good shot), punctuated by an incredible fire stunt. It goes into that formulaic concept of killing the horror icon at the end of each installment that would plague later installments of most franchises. Nothing has topped the simplicity of having the killer go through something that should have killed him and him still be out there trying to kill you that the first film left you with, and after seeing the first film, you assume that Michael is going to keep coming until Laurie is dead, which she does eventually die in Halloween 8, but I'm pretty sure our imaginations did a much better job of filling in the details.",Halloween II
505,jesusfreak00027,Excellent Continuim to the First!!!,10,9 May 2005,"Halloween II was definitely the best movie of the series in my opinion. If only the other sequels could live up to the ranks of this one. It took place in the hospital after the murders of Halloween night. But Jason continues and tracks down Laurie Strode to the hospital. The movie does an excellent job of unraveling the fact that Laurie Strode is his younger sister. The suspense of the film is huge compared to the first as Jason chases Laurie, all drugged up and injured, through the halls, killing people on his way. Again, Dr. Loomis saves the day as he prevents Laurie from receiving her terrible fate. This is one of the few horror sequels that I rank better than the first. Halloween created the legend, but Halloween II created the legacy.",Halloween II
506,arizonanguy,Great classic horror movie,9,21 March 2020,Its worth 8.5/10 but close to 9 . Actors and actress in some scenes were very bad,Halloween II
507,asleepnomore7,Very underrated!,10,19 November 2013,"The movie snobs have written scathing reviews. My opinion, is that sometimes movie critics are too old and jaded to appreciate the nostalgia of this movie; to those of my generation.Too much stock is placed in their opinions. But with that being said, I think the original vision for the ""Halloween Franchise"", was genius. I'm one of the rare people, who enjoyed and appreciated what the 3rd Halloween alluded to.I played percussion, for years. I know strong percussionists when I hear them. Does this mean that every song has to have challenging drum beats? If this were the case, the Beatles, CCR, etc...never would have recorded hit songs.Complex characters and plots aren't always necessary for a ""good"" movie.",Halloween II
508,tylercoltsfan-58723,Excellent,9,27 May 2015,"Although this movie is known to have many mistakes and is criticized highly because it was not Directed by John Carpenter, this is one of my favorite horror movies. The plot is absolutely interesting, and I love the whole hospital setting. I also think the actor who played Michael did a great job of portraying the character based on his psychological defects. This is definitely my favorite Halloween movie. The way that Laurie was not shown very often left us on edge of what was going to happen to her, and if Michael would find her. It was odd though that at the hospital there were very few doctors and nurses on duty, but I guess they had to limit characters to make the storyline fully flow. If you are curious as to whether or not to spend time watching this, I suggest that you do. This movie is great.",Halloween II
