0,TheLittleSongbird,Not so venomous,5,17 October 2018,"Do have a fondness for superhero films. 'Venom' also had talented people in the cast, Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams have both done great work in their careers, it looked interesting and found myself really fascinated to watch an origins story of one of the most interesting anti-heroes in the superhero universe.Watched 'Venom' with reasonably high expectations and with the willingness, as always, to judge the film for myself and form my own opinion. Was aware that it was not well liked by the critics, but part of me was really hoping to disagree with the thought that could a film with so much potential be worse than it actually looked? Have to agree with those that were left disappointed, while also not finding 'Venom' to be that bad. Am not though going to join in the irritatingly excessive critic bashing from people who really need to start learning the difference between fact and opinion.'Venom' does have good things. It is at its best in the scenes and chemistry between Eddie and Venom, which had fun and tension. It is when Venom arrives on screen too when the film properly starts to generate interest, after too long struggling to invest in the first act. The darker elements of the film are actually quite well done, having a dark grit and creepiness. It looks reasonably good, well designed and shot with slickness and atmosphere.The music has pleasant moments and fits well while there is some exciting action, especially the car chase sequence. Some of the effects are terrific. Tom Hardy is intensely charismatic, with Eddie/Venom being interesting and well contrasted characters, far more believable than Topher Grace in 'Spiderman 3'.However, the rest of the cast don't fare so greatly. Michelle Williams has never had a flatter character than here and is basically wasted in a development-free plot-device role. Riz Ahmed is far too anaemic for the one-dimensional villain that's both cartoonish and insipid. Of the characters, only Eddie and Venom engage and intrigue, the rest are flat. While some of the effects are terrific, others are terrible especially in the latter stages with the biggest offender being the rushed and clumsy climax.It is the script and story where 'Venom' fails most. The script is really clunky, especially with the forced and goofy humour that can be misplaced (Venom's disgust at taking the elevator was the one moment passing as funny) and the villain spouting dialogues and speeches that mean nothing. The less too about the soapy and cliché-ridden scenes featuring Hardy and Williams the better, they are bland and don't serve much point, and the Life Institute scenes should have had more clarity. Unfortunately, these scenes dominate the first act and makes it feel rather dull and ""taking too long to get going"". The story is tonally disjointed, too many tones that are very variable on their own and don't gel together, and very clunky. This is not a case of the film not trying, to me it came over as trying too hard in catering to everyone and throwing in too many ideas and elements and executing them very variably and too safely. For a story intended to be dark and violent, this seemed rather tame and held back.Summing up, a disappointment but not that bad. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Venom
1,Leofwine_draca,The worst Marvel adaptation of recent years,4,20 January 2020,"VENOM is a surprisingly awful Marvel adaptation that doesn't sit at all well with the usual likes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its generally effective comic book adaptations. This one's far sillier and more nonsensical, as token bad guy Riz Ahmed works on some alien nasties in a laboratory and weird reporter Tom Hardy gets infected. The plot is as simple as that, but what is there to enjoy here? Hardy is known for eccentric characters and they often work (check out MAD MAX: FURY ROAD) but here he just comes across as annoying and his American accent doesn't sound good either. The second half moves into predictable comic book territory, i.e. an overload of CGI effects and not much in the way of thought. Things remain tame despite attempts at a harder edge, and the decision to have the alien talk made it all laughable for me.",Venom
2,SnoopyStyle,solid stand-alone origin story,8,27 December 2018,"In San Francisco, struggling reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is ordered to do a puff piece on bio-tech mogul Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), the head of Life Foundation. Drake's spacecraft crashed after retrieving symbiotic lifeforms from a comet. Brock gets fired for asking tough questions to Drake and his fiancée Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) leaves him. Drake starts experimenting on people. Scientist Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) turns whistle-blower and sneaks Brock into the research facility. There, Brock is exposed to the symbiote Venom.I had reservations about a Venom movie without Spider-Man. I can safely say that this is vastly superior to Spider-Man 3. The interesting aspect is the relationship between Brock and Venom. They really become actual people and I can feel for them. Venom tells Brock that they're both losers. It's a surprising character reveal and one with good potential for future movies. It's a great way to do this version of Venom given the limitations of the rights issue. At first, I was concerned about Hardy but he turns in a compelling performance. I do have an issue Michelle Williams' hair. I can't tell if they deliberately gave her a bad cut or a bad wig. It does work to downgrade her from Hollywood stardom. It does set up Venom to have an ongoing franchise which is its major hurdle.",Venom
3,Prismark10,Infected rather than infectious,4,1 December 2018,"Venom was a mess. Not helped that the Marvel character has to be painted as an anti-hero of a sorts and not a villain.Tom Hardy is Eddie Brock, a committed investigative reporter in San Francisco. He has a nice apartment, an ace lawyer girlfriend (Michelle Williams.)Eddie loses it all when he has to interview an Elon Musk type businessman Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) whose spacecraft crashed. Eddie asks uncomfortable questions regarding his pharmaceutical business and gets fired.Drake has found an organism from space. Drake is conducting unethical experiments with homeless people. The organism achieves symbiosis with Eddie when he breaks into the laboratory and this gives him extraordinary powers and a desire to eat human heads.Eddie and Venom combine, but Eddie is slowly being killed by the symbiote and Venom wants to destroy the planet. Venom has a change of heart and then another more powerful symbiote is unleashed.The film is slow to get going. Hardy looks miscast but gamely tries hard with what he has. Riz is saddled as a onenote villain. Williams is just the bland girlfriend.The film fits uneasily in the Spiderman universe as it is presented as a darker film but totally it is all over the place. With so many script writers, I think this film shows all the signs of post production executive interference.",Venom
4,claudio_carvalho,Funny and Entertaining,7,2 December 2018,"""Venom"" is a funny and entertaining film based on a Marvel antihero Venom with reasonable storyline, awesome special effects and weak and annoying villain performed by the awful Riz Ahmed. However, Tom Hardy has good performance in the role of the clumsy loser Eddie Brock and Michelle Williams complete the lead cast. This film is also the chance to see Stan Lee in his last cameo. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Venom""",Venom
5,nogodnomasters,I can handle ugly,10,15 October 2018,"Rich man Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) brings back life from a passing comet. These life forms combine with humans and form a dual life. Reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) becomes one of those that combine with an alien. This is a different kind of superhero, more on the order of Deadpool who crosses lines of good and evil. Like most of the Marvel series, the film has great special effects, a long dragged out climax fight that is too long, humor, and a Stan Lee cameo. This one also has 1 F-word.",Venom
6,kosmasp,How much Venom is it(?),7,2 May 2019,"I get it, even the people who may already hit the not helpful button, before reading this. You see my rating and go: ""no way"". And I get it in the sense, that I haven't read the comics as much as many people who were expecting and hoping this would go ""R""-rated. Of course this stretches the boundaries of PG-13, because it is quite violent. But it will never be enough from what I heard from people who know the comics.So if that is something that is dear to your heart, again I get it. If you are just here to enjoy a comic book movie, there is quite a lot to enjoy. Tom Hardy really cherishes in his mania. Enjoy the Mayhem even if there was a sort of better ""inside voice"" movie last year called ""Upgrade"". So yes, if you only watch one of those make it Upgrade. But if you don't mind watching another, watch this too, because it ain't half bad",Venom
7,Sleepin_Dragon,Great film.,8,28 August 2020,"I'll be honest I'm not the biggest fan of all things Marvel, but I am a fan of Tom Hardy.I thoroughly enjoyed it, and really do need to watch more Marvel, each time I watch one I enjoy it, it's a good story, it has plenty of action, and as you'd expect the acting is terrific.Hardy is always wonderful, he is so good here, he does a fine job with the accent. The effects are so good, Venom is a terrific creation, I loved the monologues, so good.I will visit the cinema for the second, this was great. 8/10.",Venom
8,classicsoncall,"""Now let's bite all their heads off and pile them up in the corner.""",7,6 February 2019,"I actually enjoyed this one pretty well and I don't know why. It's an average anti super-hero flick, and Venom (Tom Hardy) is every bit as snarly and drooling as his presence suggests on the comic book page. The movie version here bypasses any mention of his earliest association with Spider-Man, so it seems that that will be a sequel for another day. The tone of the story is darker than those of most in the Marvel universe franchise and a welcome break from the ones in which the hero saves the day just in the nick of time. I couldn't help feeling that the mastermind behind the Life Foundation was based on industrialist Elon Musk, who's many irons in the fire make him seem more than erratic at times. Riz Ahmed was somewhat one-dimensional in his portrayal of Carlton Drake, but what would you expect of an egomaniac who didn't mind squandering the lives of impoverished street people to achieve his personal goals?I'm a little conflicted on the character of Eddie Brock, nothing to do with Tom Hardy, but the way in which he's portrayed over the course of the story as that of a loser. Yeah, he lost his job because of his arrogance with Carlton Drake, but the guy had some integrity. However in becoming a host for the symbiote Venom, he's actually turning into a malevolent character with no qualms about taking out neighborhood scum. So it remains to be seen how the Brock/Venom dynamic progresses in the Marvel movie universe.My main regret, now that I've finally seen the picture, is knowing that this is the last film in which we'll get to see a cameo by the great Stan Lee, creator of many of the super-heroes in the Marvel Comics world. Before he passed on, he did get to voice his own cartoon character in the recent 'Spider-Verse' film, but this was his last physical presence in a live action flick. For those not in the know, he was the 'Dapper Dog Walker' near the end of the movie who tells 'both' Eddie/Venom not to give up on Anne (Michelle Williams). Physically he looked great on screen, which makes it all the harder to believe he passed away just a short month after the picture's release.",Venom
9,jboothmillard,Venom,4,15 October 2018,"There have been a couple of anti-superhero movies before, where a villain or anti-hero is the lead, including Catwoman and Suicide Squad, the well-known Marvel character, enemy of Spider-Man, previously appeared in the not so good Spider-Man 3, this was his first solo movie, directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad). Basically, a probe belonging to bioengineering corporation Life Foundation has crash landed in Malaysia, after exploring space for new habitable worlds. A comet covered in symbiotic lifeforms was discovered, four samples have been brought back to Earth, one escaped and caused the crash, the other three samples are transported to the Life Foundation research facility in San Francisco. CEO Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) learns that the symbiotes cannot survive without oxygen-breathing hosts, which often reject the symbiosis. Investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) reads a classified document about Drake's human trials, his fiancée Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), an attorney involved in preparing a lawsuit defence for Life Foundation, was in possession of this document. Eddie confronts Drake, leading to both Eddie and Anne losing their jobs, Anne breaks off their engagement and ends their relationship. Six months later, Drake is getting closer to achieving successful symbiosis. Eddie is approached by Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate), one of Drake's scientists who disagrees with his methods and wants to help Eddie expose him. She helps Eddie break into the research facility to search for evidence, there he is shocked to find an acquaintance of his, homeless woman Maria (Melora Walters), has become one of Drake's test subjects. Eddie attempts to rescue Maria, but she attacks him and the symbiote possessing her transfers from her body to his, leaving her dead. Eddie escapes, but he soon begins displaying strange symptoms and reaches out to Anne for help, her new boyfriend Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott) examines Eddie and discovers the symbiote. Meanwhile, Drake executes Skirth for her betrayal by exposing her to the remaining captive symbiote, which ultimately dies, this means the symbiote inside Eddie is the only known surviving specimen. Drake sends mercenaries to retrieve Eddie and the symbiote inside him, but it takes over Eddie's body and transforms him into a monstrous creature that fights off the attackers. Taking shelter outside of the city, the symbiote communicates with Eddie and introduces itself as Venom, and it explains that the comet is an invasion force searching for new worlds where the symbiotes can possess and devour the inhabitants. Venom offers to spare Eddie if he helps the symbiotes achieve their goal, and Eddie soon comes to enjoy the superhuman attributes that the symbiote gives him. Eddie breaks into his old workplace to give evidence of Drake's crimes, but a SWAT team surround him on the way out, so Venom transforms him once again to escape. Anne witnesses this transformation and takes Eddie back to Lewis's office, where it is revealed that the symbiote inside of Eddie is slowly rotting his internal organs, Eddie also admits that the symbiote has two weaknesses: high-pitched noises and fire. Although Venom claims the organ damage is a fixable part of their symbiosis, Eddie uses the noise of an MRI machine to weaken the symbiote long enough for Eddie to separate from it, Eddie is then captured by Drake's men. Meanwhile, the fourth symbiote, Riot, has made its way from Malaysia to San Francisco by hopping from body to body, including an EMT (emergency medical technician) (Michelle Lee) from the crash site, an elderly woman (Vickie Eng), and a little girl (Zeva DuVall). Riot bonds with Drake, he agrees to take Riot in a Life Foundation space probe to collect the rest of the symbiotes and bring them to Earth. Anne reluctantly bonds with Venom so they can free Eddie, they are eventually bonded again, Venom states he has been convinced to help protect the Earth from his kind through his interactions with Eddie. The pair attempt to stop Riot and Drake with Anne's help, Venom damages the probe as it takes off, causing it to explode and kill both Riot and Drake, Anne believes Eddie is no longer bonded to Venom after this, and that the symbiote also died in the explosion. However, the Eddie and Venom remain secretly bonded and set out to protect the city by killing criminals, Eddie also returns to journalism, and is invited to interview incarcerated serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson). Also starring Scott Haze as Security Chief Roland Treece, Peggy Lu as Mrs. Chen, Malcolm C. Murray as Lewis Donate, Sope Aluko as Dr. Collins, Wayne Pére as Dr. Emerson, Bruce Almighty's Emilio Rivera as Lobby Guard Richard and Stan Lee as Dapper Dog Walker. Hardy is likeable as the reporter, and he thrives as the snarly voice of Venom, together they make an amusing twisted buddy duo, Ahmed is a slightly two-dimensional power-hungry scientist villain, and Williams is also a bit simple as the ex-girlfriend. There is no argument, the special effects to create the alien creatures and exciting sequences are brilliant, and there are worthwhile fast-paced chases and fights, but the overall film is a bit of a mess, the story and dialogue is a bit predictable, it shifts awkwardly between tones of tension and thrills, adding near forced humour, and sometimes it doesn't seem to know where to go, a reasonable almost below average superhero fantasy action horror. Okay!",Venom
10,paul_haakonsen,Was that really it?...,5,1 December 2018,"Right, well granted my lack of interest in superhero movies, then I couldn't exactly claim to be thrilled when this movie was announced, even so when it hit the cinema. So it was only when given the chance to watch it that I got around to it. Can't exactly claim that ""Venom"" was high on my movies to watch.First of all, well aside from it being a superhero movie, then I wasn't particularly enthralled with it being Tom Hardy having the lead role. Not much of a fan of his, to be honest. But I will say that he carried the movie quite nicely, despite having very little to work with in terms of a thoroughly-crafted script. Yeah, the storyline was fairly simplistic, and the script was almost so light-weight that it was non-existing.The special effects and CGI in the movie were adequate. They weren't the kind that have you going ""wow, that's spectacular and impressive"". So for a movie made in 2018 it felt that they cut back on the effects budget in a way.Now, I was having a bit of a hard time whether to take the movie as a serious movie, or if it was meant to be a comedy. Venom was all over the place, in terms of it being a comedy movie or a serious movie, and even had elements that bordered on horror on it. But it was sort of hard to take some of the things that Venom said seriously.I wasn't impressed by ""Venom"". And to be honest, then it would have taken very little to impress me, because I am not a fan of superhero movies and tend to avoid them. I am sure that there is a fanbase for ""Venom"" out there, but for us that aren't attuned to the superhero genre, then ""Venom"" had very little to offer in terms of entertainment, aside from being a generic action movie.",Venom
11,BandSAboutMovies,Why are they still making superhero movies this poor?,4,28 December 2018,"Directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad), Venom has appeared on plenty of worst of lists this year. I held back judgment until I saw the movie. I can sum it up in one word: underwhelming. But after all, who was clamoring for a Venom movie after Spider-Man 3? Who was needing one in 2018? And after the magic of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, why do filmmakers feel they can still be so lazy with superheroes?

After all, it was a box office success, ultimately earning $855 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 2018.It all comes down to one good thing: Tom Hardy. It's like this dude has to have the craziest voices in movies. His Eddie Brock voice is just the most need to please accent ever, while Venom, in his own words, is a ""James Brown lounge lizard."" The relationship between these two characters -- who become one person -- is the best part of the movie. Hardy also improvised a lot, such as when he jumps into a lobster tank to cool down. I kind of love that the dude was pretty much making up his own film. The actor claimed that he based his performance on Woody Allen, Conor McGregor and Redman.Everything else -- from the villains to Eddie Brock's relationships -- is as generic as it gets. Big points for having Jenny Slate in here, even if she does nothing. It's like the film felt it had to give us an origin when all we want to see is Venom break stuff. The end of the film, where he eats a criminal and meets Cletus ""Carnage"" Kasady (and come on, who doesn't want to watch Matthew McConaughey against Hardy in a battle of accents and overacting) is exactly what everyone really wants, not nearly two hours of generic soldiers and Venom battling Elon Musk.In the spin of selling this movie, Columbia Pictures president Sanford Panitch claimed that ""Venom was considered a spin on a horror film, inspired by the works of John Carpenter and David Cronenberg, but with more pop and fun."" People that say these kinds of things have never seen films by these two directors.

13,Coventry,"Less jokes, more biting off heads!",5,29 June 2021,"My 12-year-old son is an avid Marvel/comic book adaptation fanatic, whilst his old man is a diehard horror lover; - so watching this ""Venom"" together is probably the closest we come to a father & son bonding session. With nearly two hours of non-stop digital effects, mass destruction, cool transformations and plenty of action, my son had a jolly good time. Me, being an old-fashioned guy and a hater of computerized playgrounds, had quite many eye-rolling moments throughout the film. Still, I found ""Venom"" much more entertaining than the average installment in the ""Avengers"", ""Spiderman"", ""Thor"" or ""Captain America"" franchises, simply because the pivot character is (initially, at least...) a purely evil and undefeatable extraterrestrial force. I tried to look at ""Venom"" as a traditional type of alien invasion Sci-Fi/horror, with the nasty looking symbiote being reminiscent to the creatures in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" or ""The Thing"". Although far superior to human beings, the alien is a parasite and needs a bodily host. The fact that he fires off slick one-liners and develops a conscience is most unfortunate, but commercially inevitable, I guess. Oh well, at least the big, ugly and monstrous creep bites off a couple of heads. I'm always in favor of that.",Venom

15,CinemaSerf,"More in the vein of ""Deadpool"" - and all the better for it.",7,28 August 2020,"I really quite enjoyed this.

Initially hostile, the being ""Venom"" takes rather a like to it's new host and together they join up for some typical Marvel adventures as ""Drake"" also becomes a host and a battle royale ensues to save the Earth. Sure, it's all pretty derivative comic-book stuff, but this is really all about Hardy and he is great - indeed had Chris Pratt not already had ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" then he'd have made an excellent ""Quill"". He has lots of fun here, portrays the vocals for his monster buddy wittily too and the enjoyment he is clearly having is contagious. The visual effects are good, as you'd expect, and so is the writing - it's sharp and laconic at times. There's a little bit of romantic interest from Michelle Williams, but these scenes are mercifully intermittent and don't really interfere with what is essentially a decent, action adventure film with a strong lead.

16,zardoz-13,A Different Kind of Marvel Superhero!!!,10,17 November 2018,"When Robert Downey, Jr.'s tour-de-force performance as irreverent arms manufacturer Tony Stark in ""Iron Man"" (2009) changed the standard-issue superhero genre, and The Marvel Cinematic Universe left the DC Universe wallowing in the dust. First, Paramount and then Disney appropriated the MCU, and DC is still staggering around in a hopeless daze despite their efforts to imitate Marvel. Second, a posse of charismatic Marvel show-stoppers ensued, and characters such as Thor, The Hulk, Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, Captain America, Black Panther, and Guardians of the Galaxy followed with great fanfare and success. Although all these heroes were slick, shiny, and sexy, Disney kept them as squeaky clear savory as their PG-13 ratings. Meantime, while DC struggled with the likes of Superman, Batman, and the Justice League, Disney's foremost Marvel studio rival Twentieth Century Fox sent their Marvel superheroes into action. ""The X-Men"" charted a far grittier path with director Bryan Singer, a notorious helmer who could never land a job with the Mouse House, any more than James Gunn will ever do again. Not only are Singer and Gunn originals, but they are also mutants in a sense. The rivalry between Disney and Fox is clear-cut, and Fox isn't as savory as the clowns at Disney. Unexpectedly, Fox shook up the Marvel Cinematic Universe with ""Deadpool,"" and Ryan Reynolds rocketed to fame as the snarky new kid on the block.""Deadpool,"" Reynolds, and Fox plunged recklessly into the rated-R zone, and they turned the MCU upside-down, enough to push the Wolverine epic ""Logan"" into the R-rated territory. Disney reins in their MCU with PG-13 ratings, while Fox has displayed greater flexibility with R-rated efforts. Sony, originally the home for ""Spider-man,"" has launched several other characters. If ""Deadpool"" took superhero sagas to the next level, ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleisher has taken it further with Tom Hardy in ""Venom."" Although ""Venom"" remains in the PG-13 zone, this new character shares more in common with ""Deadpool."" Despite the devastating critical reviews that mauled ""Venom"" in its opening weekend, the latest addition to the MCU soared to the top of the box office in its first week of release and came close to earning its production budget back in the first week.""Venom"" is a whole lot of fun, and Tom Hardy is far from restrained as he shares his body with an alien Symbiote. Tongue-in-cheek adequately epitomizes ""Venom,"" and this mash-up of an investigative reporter with alien pushes the envelope in a different but welcome direction. If you don't love ""Venom,"" then something is seriously wrong with you. The new origins epic about these two, who they are and how they came together is first-rate entertainment with a challenging villain and a hero who doesn't wear a spandex suit. Think of ""Venom"" as the flipside of ""Alien,"" with a sympathetic being from another world joining forces with a human, and you'll have some idea what to expect from this lively escapade that is flippant without being grotesque. Tom Hardy vanishes from sight once Venom takes over his body, which means that Hardy doesn't have to worry about a form-fitting superhero costume. Set in San Francisco, ""Venom"" chronicles the demise of Eddie Brock, an investigative journalist who loses his job when it goes off on a tangent with a billionaire megalomaniac who shoots rocket ships into space since NASA has powered down. Villainous Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed of ""Nightcrawler"") wants to explore the universe on his own terms, and this includes his dream of living on another planet in outer space. Drake's villainy knows no ends, and he is oblivious to the cost of achieving his dream. Literally, this guy has no qualms about doing whatever he wants no matter how illegal it is. One of his missiles brings an alien intelligence to Earth, and Drake wants to abandon the Earth that he believes is on a collision course with extinction. He wants to cohabit with an alien organism, so he can reside elsewhere in the galaxy.Imagine Drake's disgust when the only person that can survive fusion with his space organism is Eddie Brock. Earlier, Drake wielded his clout to get Brock fired from his job as an investigative television journalist. At the time, a naïve Eddie didn't realize the extent of Charlton Drake's power. Literally, our protagonist is taken down several notches, loses his job, and worse, his fiancée breaks up with him because he took a peek at her confidential files and used information from them to intimidate Drake. No sooner has Eddie been fired than he discovers to his chagrin that his fiancée, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams of ""A Thousand Acres"") has canned from her job as an attorney. Eventually, she finds another lover, Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott of ""The Veil""), but she still has feelings for Eddie. One of Carlton Drake's researchers, Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate of ""This Means War"") approaches a reluctant Eddie, who has not only lost Anne, but also had to move into a seamier apartment, about the unethical experiments that Drake is conducting on homeless people. Drake has deluded these poor people, and he confines them to a lab while he watches if they can co-exist with the alien creatures. The attempts repeatedly fail, until Eddie sneaks into Drake's facilities with Dr. Skirth's help and is absorbed by one of those things. Dr. Skirth calls these organisms 'symbiotes,' while Eddie refers to it as a parasite. Before long, Eddie realizes that his body is changing because of 'Venom,' and this creature can assert its power of him. Drake dispatches his henchmen to capture Eddie, and an adrenaline-laced, high speed chase through San Francisco ensues, with our hero performing some incredible acrobatics on a bike. Venom can talk to Eddie, but only Eddie can hear him. ""Venom"" qualifies as an unforgettable superhero epic. The scenes with the pistol-wielding thug who robs a convenience store where Eddie shops are fantastic!",Venom
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Not as poisonous as it's been made out to be,7,21 October 2018,"Eddie Brock(Hardy, managing both the ""regular guy"" and the physicality of the dual role) is a reporter who fights for the little guy(well, that's how he's introduced. Later on that doesn't impact much of anything). However, he gets overeager and ends up getting fired. Offscreen? Shown? First one, then the other. It's one of several things where it feels like the script was first written to be one way, and then later rewritten, but they left in a lot of the old stuff. Another is that an astronaut whose body is temporarily taken over is named Jameson(yes, must in fact be the son of the Daily Bugle publisher and/or editor-in-chief). Why is that in a movie that doesn't have Peter Parker? It feels like something that was in an original draft for Sam raimi's Spider-man 3, before Topher Grace(I don't hate him in... hmm... Traffic. I'm sure he's a perfectly nice guy. I just don't want him in my action blockbuster sequels. He was wrong for Predators, too) was brought in to ruin the titular character of this. Anyway. He ends up being bonded with a symbiote(that's ""-ee-"", not ""-eye-""), and discovering... a fiendish plot that could destroy the world(*dramatic music cue*).As many(seemingly most) other audience members, I enjoyed this a lot. With that said, it could be better. Venom(Tom, with a modulated voice, with personality, not one-note) himself, always a voice(at first, that's all he is) in our lead's head, will frequently argue with him, occasionally answer his questions to other people, etc. And ultimately go from acting like he's in a flesh taxi, into agreeing to a coexistence that both are happy with(not necessarily credibly depicted). It's an unusual trait for this kind of picture, and is genuinely memorable. I mean that in a good way. Except for what you'll remember for the wrong reasons, such as the sitcom level humor of scenes like the one where he ends up taking a bath in the lobster tank of a restaurant, to the confusion of everyone eating there. The action, while cool, could have been unique. We get a motorcycle chase(with kamikaze drones that make you wonder why they don't use a single drone firing rockets) that's at least several minutes too long, some straightforward fighting(yes, it's unusual that he's ""not doing it himself"". That's also in The Tuxedo. It's funnier there), and an indecipherable climax(with very nifty weapons). It's badass. What it also is, unfortunately, is far below average for the subgenre, today. Yes, this does feel like it was made 10 to 15 years ago(other than the pretty good special effects), when expectations were lower, and they made mistakes rarely seen today(even in the DCEU). With that said, this is far superior to the likes of Catwoman, any live-action Fantastic 4 released so far, and the first Ghost Rider. It's also quite reminiscent of The Mask, and it doesn't top it.There is a lot of moderate violence, a little strong language, and a little implied gruesome gore in this. I recommend this to fans, provided they are fine with this being less than ideal. 7/10",Venom
18,neil-476,"Not bad, not great",7,6 October 2018,"Venom's first solo outing isn't bad. But it's not that good, either.Take it as read that the effects are good, and that Tom Hardy delivers.But the film isn't sure whether it wants to be light (Marvel, remembering to be fun even when the snap takes out half of everyone) or dark (DC, depressing, box-office far below expectations).So it tries to go for light while still having Venom biting off the heads of policemen. This inconsistency of approach means the film doesn't really succeed as either light or dark.The 3D is feeble and pointless, and the film is so dark that you can hardly see much of it with 3D glasses on.Tom Hardy is good, but it's difficult to like Eddie because he's such a pillock.The film is OK, but it could have been better.",Venom
19,view_and_review,Has Staying Power,7,8 October 2018,"The Marvel train keeps on rolling and getting more and more confident. There was a time that they wouldn't have released Venom. An obscure character except to the Spider-Man and Marvel fans, not truly a good guy, relies heavily on CGI to make him like the comic--not likely a movie they would've released in years past. But now Marvel has built such a good brand, much like Apple, Google, Nike, etc., they can boldly release nearly any character with a certain amount of confidence.Venom had a bit of a weak storyline to it but it was good once they got into the meat and potatoes. It was a bit contrived in order to get Venom merged with Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) but they did a good job making the audience forget how we'd gotten to the action. Venom has staying power like most Marvel movies.",Venom
20,ferguson-6,tried to find the good,4,4 October 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. For those movie-goers who believe there is no need for another comic book movie, you now have People's Exhibit A. This is the 5th Marvel film of 2018 (yep, that's a new one every other month!), and it's the first one proving challenging to say much of anything that is positive or complimentary. The packed house at the screening had very few reactions during the movie, and seemed deflated afterwards.It should be noted that this is not a Superhero movie, but rather a film based on the Marvel Comic characters and stories of Todd McFarlane and David Michelinie. Four writers are credited with the screenplay, and it seems they either needed more or fewer. Director Ruben Fleisher (ZOMBIELAND, 2009) apparently worked with what he was given, hoping the stellar cast or the CGI could salvage the project. The always terrific Tom Hardy (Bane in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES) stars as Eddie Brock, a renowned investigative reporter popular for breaking stories of corruption and fraud. Unfortunately, he has a significant lapse in ethics - an unusually forthright comment from Hollywood on today's media. This lapse costs Brock his job, his girlfriend (4 time Oscar nominee Michelle Williams), and any semblance of normalcy. While investigating the unimaginable human-alien experiments of megalomaniac Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), Brock takes on the powers of the symbiote (Venom) and spends the rest of the movie either trying to control these powers, sitting back and letting the powers take over, or exchanging frat boy dialogue with the possessive being who picked up all nuances of the English language pretty darn quickly.Venom was last seen in the lackluster SPIDER-MAN 3 and was played by Topher Grace. This time out, Venom is the focus and Spidey is nowhere to be found or mentioned ... at least not until post credits (a terrific animated sequence). The CGI is at times very impressive - reminiscent of something John Carpenter might have ordered. Two sides of the Transamerica Pyramid provide a nice visual, however, the effects are not at all consistent. Far too often ... especially the battle between Venom and Riot ...it's just plain messy (like letting a group of toddlers play with black and gray slime). The film's saving grace could have been the interactions between Mr. Hardy and Ms. Williams, both stellar actors, but the dialogue and situations are so ridiculous that even those scenes don't click. The moments that draw laughter from the audience may or may not have been by design, but there are far too many 'forced comedic moments' that just fall flat. Composer Ludwig Goransson (CREED, BLACK PANTHER) delivers some nice moments with the score, but the Eminem song over the closing credits sounds amateurish. The film is very loud, and not so much lacking direction as it is burdened with too many directions and misfires. A comic book movie's first priority is to be fun, and this one just isn't much of that. Surprisingly, the film is rated PG-13 rather than R, so the excessive violence (and there is plenty) never actually spills a drop of blood. Perhaps the goal was to make a Marvel movie so uninspiring that BLACK PANTHER's Oscar chances would be enhanced. Otherwise, there's no excuse.",Venom
21,trashgang,had fun with it and movie was over before I knew it,8,6 January 2019,"Didn't know the backstory of Venom but you don't need that because it's all explained very quickly and that is what makes this a enjoyable really good movie. I was in it from the beginning, no bad moments at all and suddenly it was all over. Great ending too. Makes you eager to watch Venom 2.Tom Hardy does great as Venom. If you can't stand jokes in a superhero flick stay away from this. The spiderman flicks did had funny situations and the Deadpool franchise was over the top of jokes, this is in between. Because the 'parasite' do talk to Tom it makes it all great. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of fighting going on and that is really nasty, no jokes there.Better than expected, Venom is really worth seeing.

22,deloudelouvain,Great action and great character. I want more of it.,8,17 December 2018,"I have absolutely no clue why Venom has such a low rating. I understand that if you don't like Marvel movies this one isn't going to make you change your mind, even though I thought it was refreshing for a Marvel movie. But why would you watch this genre of movies if it's not your thing? I'm not a particular huge fan of Marvel, even though I watch them all, but I like those kind of movies because it's easy entertainment. Venom might not be a superhero but it's for sure entertaining to watch. Not as funny as Deadpool, but funnier than all the other superhero movies. Tom Hardy has the right character face to play this role. But the most positive point about Venom must be the special effects and CGI's. Those were on top and made this a proper action movie that you will enjoy from the beginning till the end. So just forget about those negative reviews, they just don't have a clue how an enjoyable Marvel movie should be.",Venom

And it was fun. Predictable, yes. Nothing really innovative, true. But it was a well done movie, with a simple story and acted well.

Lee did not work on the script, but the team of writers who did wrote a really good script. The humor is solid again. Why does it take Marvel to hit the mark with humor on movies about heros?Aliens who clone themselves with humans after they crash land on earth is the main plot here. Tom Hardy is great in the main role. The support cast including Michelle Williams is good too. This film stands well as the plot centers around San Francisco and aliens trying to take over earth. Yes, humans are ruining the planet, but the aliens want to kill everyone with the planet.I enjoyed this film more than I expected, and it is a lot less predictable than the recent remake of ""A Star Is Born"". I actually got more involved emotionally with Hardy's personal struggles with the alien within him. Good film, check it out.",Venom
25,thesar-2,Downgraded,3,22 December 2018,"Nice to know Superman exists in the Marvel Universe.Earlier this year, I watched Upgrade and followed that incredible movie with a review of this film, Venom, where the reviewer did a hilarious side-by-side comparison between the two films. As funny as that was, it wasn't 50% accurate. 2018's Upgrade was 5x the movie Venom was.That said, Venom was still somewhat worth watching, if only for the hunk Tom Hardy is. In the first half, anyways.After an enormously long first act, we finally got to some of the symbiotic goods. Generic rich bad guy brings back a parasite (sorry!) from space, but fails at finding the perfect host. Enter in Bane, sorry, not him or the 3rd villain from Spider-Man 3 and Venom is born.Follow that by some so-so action scenes with several horrible CGI effects, we finally land on a plot and the final act can put us to sleep. Well, it did me. I literally had to rewind it several times to complete the climactic battle between two battling blobs.Sad thing is, while said first half was slow, at least Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and other characters were interesting and deep. The moment the CGI hit the bodies, Hardy turned into a cartoon and comically bad to watch. It was like two completely different movies for him to star in and lost me.Additionally, it felt like the script just needed one, maybe two more rewrites. The whole movie felt disjointed at times and almost a chore to finish. Also, Venom/Eddie Brock's not just an antihero, he's a straight up murderer...so stop trying to get me to be on his side!***Final thoughts: Boy, do I miss Spider-Man. Guess I better see his animated movie soon in theatres and wash this black goo right off me.",Venom
26,cherold,"often tedious, though at moments it barely scrapes watchable",5,17 April 2019,"I hadn't intended to watch Venom after hearing of its critical drubbing, but when I saw it got a respectable 6.8 from user reviews I thought maybe it was worth taking a look.It wasn't. It isn't.This first thing to be said about Venom is it is really, really boring. The setup, in which we see Eddie Brock's pre-Venom life, goes on forever (well, maybe a half hour), interspersed on with a few look-how-evil-I-am scenes for the villain. At a certain point I started using the ski-forward button on my video player to see if I could find where the action started.As for the action, it was fine, I suppose. Venom's shape-shifting abilities lead to some decent moments. Not *great* moments, but decent.In fact, if you removed all the non-action scenes you'd have something short but tolerable. But it would be very short, because even when the movie kicks into its highest gear, there's still a lot of down time.The repartee between Venom and Brock is okay, but Upgrade, which I haven't seen yet, has a more entertaining take on the same basic concept in the *trailer*.Some critics described this movie as awful but entertainingly so. This is not true. This is unentertainingly awful. It should not be watched, by anyone, ever. The people rating it highly on IMDB should seek psychiatric help.",Venom

28,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Undelivering big screen adaptation of little known comic book hero,4,31 October 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningEddie Brock (Tom Hardy) makes a living doing online videos, attempting to expose big scandals. In his latest video, he has tangled with Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), the head of a bio-engineering firm that has been involved in a number of controversial events, costing him his job and his fiancé. Drake has secretly got hold of a bizarre, shape shifting mutagen, and after breaking into his laboratory, Eddie unwittingly becomes its host, transforming him into the crime fighting gargoyle Venom.There's nothing like an adult orientated comic book adaptation, not least because it excludes the auditorium you're watching it in from any noisy, rambunctious kids, as well as just generally providing a more rounded, uncensored experience. They tend to be more obscure, little known creations that just have their own little cult following among their devotees, and no parents will be pestered by their offspring to take them along to see it, having never heard of it. These have ranked among some of my favourites, such as Deadpool 1 and 2 and The Punisher films (no matter what anyone says!) but Venom sadly falls short of this mark, while doing nothing aesthetically wrong, it's just too mechanical and ineffective to be one you'd want to see again.The first big disappointment is that, in spite of the 15 certificate, there doesn't seem to be anything more edgy than in your average Spiderman film, despite some rocky language. The host character, played charismatically by a wise-cracking Hardy, takes up much of the first half of the film, but the titular character takes too long to make his presence felt, and despite being physically impressive, with a seriously scary face, sounds too much like The Honey Monster from the Sugar Puffs ads. The action is shot too close up, with too many quick cuts and, even being an action film, is too loud. All the dialogue feels stilted and staged, and none of it sounds real or convincing. The wafer thin plot isn't strong enough to hold everything together throughout the course. Meanwhile, Ahmed is too weedy and nerdy to be taken seriously as the villain.It subtly borrows little pieces of other films, from more adult fare like Predator, to kids films like Super Mario Brothers, without having any kind of solid structure to stand as a film on its own. It's all rounded off with the title track from Eminem, who's gone from making personal, deep raps about his life to doing the soundtrack to superhero movies. I've just found out the character was created by that Todd McFarlane guy, the same guy behind Spawn, which this reminded me so much of. The film version of that was absolutely savaged by critics when it came out, but I loved it. This, sadly, doesn't hold up, but you just know there'll be an inevitable sequel that'll be even worse. **",Venom
29,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"You can't polish a turd, but they could've at least tried.",4,3 October 2018,"'Venom (2018)' is usually just fine, but it never comes close to being properly engaging or even all that entertaining. It just constantly skirts the line between being pretty decent and just downright boring. This - combined with its overall weak, poorly paced narrative and its general technical choppiness (including noticeably 'jumpy' editing and several scenes that are strangely blurry, to the point that it seems like the focus-pulled might've been asleep) - means that the overall experience isn't all that good. The film certainly lands with a whimper rather than a roar. It actually takes ages for Brock to become the eponymous big-boy and, when he does, the dynamic between him and his newfound companion never comes close to being fully formed or even consistent. This means that we can't really relate to - or care for - either of them and that their motivations don't really make all that much sense. Their relationship is supposed to be the driving-force of the story, yet it doesn't naturally evolve and never comes close to being compelling. To make matters worse, the whole thing culminates in an awful, CG mess of a finale that's literally difficult to watch, much less comprehend. It inexplicably goes back on several core conceits simply to have our symbiotic lead emerge as a more 'traditional' hero, despite the piece being billed as a decidedly 'villainous' affair. The feature is pretty tame in general, to be honest. It all just comes across as more of poor-man's 'Upgrade (2018)' than anything else. Don't even get me started on the absolute joke of an end-credits scene. 4/10",Venom
30,bowmanblue,Highly watchable,7,1 July 2019,"Throw a half-brick up into the air and odds are that it will land on - yet another - superhero movie. They're everywhere. Granted they're pretty profitable and every studio wants a slice of Disney/Marvel's share of the market, so you can't blame Sony for 'rebooting' the popular anti-hero who was sort of featured in a Spiderman film which now feels like several hundred years ago.Die-hard audiences weren't happy with how the titular character 'Venom' was portrayed before, but, due to various licensing deals between Sony and Disney, this outing won't feature Spiderman himself. Therefore, few people had high hopes about whether this version would be much better than the previous effort.I don't know much about the comic source material, but I'm suitably informed that this new film changes Venom's origins slightly. A (typically mad) scientist intercepts a load of evil black space goo and decides to bring it back to Earth to eat us. One such kindly portion of black computer-generated nastiness infects a San Francisco news reporter, Eddie Brock, and - sometimes - turns him into a giant monster with a desire to eat human body parts. Nice, huh?Now, for some reason, everything about 'Venom' shouldn't really work. And yet it did. Granted it's certainly no masterpiece, but it's great fun for all its - many - flaws. For a start, as many pointed out, for a film which is based on an alien that likes to tear people apart, there's effectively no gore (it's PG-13 - a sign that possibly Sony are hoping to get Venom into Marvel's shared cinematic universe?). This annoyed some, but, like I say, I don't know enough about the original to really let it bother me.Marvel may be the bog kid on the block, but it's not beyond criticism, i.e. that almost every film without Loki is lacking a decent antagonist. Well, even the worst MCU villain is better than the businessman/scientist who's supposed to be Venom's nemesis. Yes, there's a post credit scene which is obviously designed to set up the next big villain and, from what I saw, he's going to be a damn sight more menacing that what we got here.Perhaps 'Venom's' main appeal is Tom Hardy. He's an excellent actor in everything he does and he seems to be able to lift a potentially mediocre film to something that's actually good fun. He's at his best when he's bantering with his 'alter-ego' as he can hear the alien creature in his head. In fact, he has more chemistry with a disembodied voice than he does with the obligatory 'love interest' who I can't even remember her name.I know that we're spoiled for choice when it comes to superhero movies, so, if you fancy one that isn't actually set in Marvel's 'shared universe' and is simple, fun and where you don't really have to think too hard about anything, then there's certainly worse about than 'Venom.'",Venom
31,ThomasDrufke,A Real Turd in the Wind,1,17 October 2018,"So here's the thing, there isn't a single part of this movie that I liked. I can see where some people found it to be stupid entertainment and silly fun, but that's not exactly the way I like movies. There are always exceptions, but with a cast like Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, and Woody Harrelson (sort of), I expect a lot more. The script for this film is by far one of the worst things put to film over the last few years. I flat out laughed out loud at how bad some of these lines were. And by no means did I think most of this humor was intentional. If you watch any of the trailers for the film, they are pitching a serious & dark take on the Venom character, so don't give me the whole ""it's supposed to bad"" take. That's just not true. You can forget ever seeing Spider-Man show up in these movies, at least if Sony/Marvel wants me to take him seriously at all.

I love enjoying movies in any shape or form, and I think a lot of today's critics are very rigid about what makes a good movie, and every beat that you need to take in order to make a movie good. I liked Venom, it's not particularly good, certainly not in the same way my most recent review, BlackKlansman, is good. That being said, I had a fun time, I went in with low expectations due to the annihilation this was getting from critics, and came out not feeling like I wasted my time.Just to make it clear, it is incredibly flawed. Every character bar Eddie Brick/Venom are stale are stale as cardboard such as the villain, who Riz Ahmed is still putting as much life as possible in to, and the love interest, who Michelle Williams feels so wasted in, I was convinced it was not her due to the brutal material she was given.The first thirty minutes or so are pretty awful, the execution in to the main plot felt extremely flat. However, once the symbiote got in to Eddie Brock, played fittingly larger than life by Tom Hardy, I was able to switch my brain off and have a good time. The concept of this protagonist, who is practically inactive because of this being controlling him became so intriguing to watch, seeing this guy who had ultimately no control over the situation he was in. I began forgiving the movie for failing to pull me in earlier, cause now I was completely immersed in this large scaled adventure. While immensely flawed, I still enjoyed Venom, and would watch it again. The film carries out the traditional Marvel fare quite well, such as Stan Lee's cameo and an excellent after credits scene. Do not go in expecting perfection and you will enjoy yourself.

40,ironhorse_iv,The Eddie Brock Show was not quite a turd in the wind. It was just mediocre at best.,6,9 November 2018,"Directed by Ruben Fleischer & based off, 'Venom: Lethal Protector' & the 'Planet of the Symbiotes' comic book storylines in which the titular character is the hero trying to stop an alien symbiote invasion. The movie look like it was going to be box office poison without the character of Spiderman. However, it was a theatrically success. Still, it's surreal that Sony & Columbia Pictures would make a picture without Spidey. Not only, were their relationship were so bonded as nemeses, but having around Spiderman is essential to the birth story for Venom. After all, in Marvel Comics, the alien start out as living altered costume for the Web-Slinger, that fed way too much into the hero's strength, aggression and courage to the point, that the wall crawler had to reject, its creepy power over him. Thus, the alien merge with reporter, Eddie Brock, sensing his hatred for Spiderman & became Venom. However, in this version, all connections to Spiderman are omitted, including the reason why his name is Venom, the 'White Spider' chest insignia & the webbing. Because of that, there is little to no good reason, why the alien would genuinely care for Eddie, long term. Brock is lot more cowardly & really not that compatible in mass & high adrenaline; compare to his comic book counterpart. The movie tries to get around that, by painting the two as loveable losers with different personalities whom, due to unseen circumstance have to work with each other, in order to take out, the bigger threats of their societies. Hints, why Eddie is having multiple organ failures at the beginning, until the alien start to care. However, in this 'Lethal Weapon' style buddy comedy; where Eddie would be the laid back straight man playing off to the alien's strange impulsive behaviors that certainly got lot of laughs; it still doesn't match with creepy body horror tone. It comes across as highly jolting to the senses; seeing an alien talks like a frat bro, rather than menacing & demonic; even after intermixing with Brock's personality. Things get more complicate, as we never get the full sense, why Venom would rather bonded than used his host up. Nor do we get any good reasons why he would dumbly sacrifice himself by going to the hospital, knowing full well that Brock is trying to get rid of him. His actions don't make any sense. It's really off-putting. I guess, you can say that the being was always deemed insane by his own race, but it doesn't explain, why the main villain would invite Venom to the invasion of Earth, in the first place. The movie lack coherent writing. A good example of this, is the parts, where the antagonist uses a little girl & old lady that are not that compatible due to their weak frames as a long term hosts! It's seem odd. To add to that, why did that being, escape the Life Foundation's imprisonment, then wander aimlessly for months, only to go back to them? It doesn't add up. In truth, Venom should had been the symbiote that escaped at the beginning. Have Eddie try to get rid of him with the enemies' help, only for Brock to find out, the sinister actions that the group has untaken would had been more compelling story. It would help the pacing and logically make more sense than having a scientist allow Brock to break into the lab to take photos, rather than herself, secretly filming it. In the end, the film has little structure. Regardless, the erections, they do have, are slightly too contrived. Coincidences such as Venom being able to be compatible with a small dog & a smaller woman is gobbledygook questionable. Nevertheless, the action scenes in this movie are just as confusing. Why would the villain send a fleet of exploding drones after the symbiote if they want to be low key? It's just plain messy & generic. None of them really stand out. I saw similar combat in films like 2008's ""Incredible Hulk' & 1997's 'Spawn'. However, the parasite battle is the worst. Not only did the trailer spoil, most of the fight. It really impossible to tell what happening, between the murky pitch blackness lighting and sloppy dark CGI. Regardless, I can understand, why the filmmakers dial down the violence, in order to reach more audience, and have appeal for a MCU crossover in the future, but if there is any comic book movie that should had an R-Rating. It should had been 'Venom'. The titular alien is known for dismembering & eating body parts of his victims. It should had taken advance of it, rather than playing it safe, by cutting away from these gruesome scenes. Let's hope the sequel with Carnage doesn't do that. As for the acting. Michelle Williams isn't given much to do. Her character, Anne is pretty much, just a love interest with little chemistry with the main star. Also, I found it odd, that her character had no problems with allowing a parasite control her body and mind for cannibalistic reasons. The other characters are equally as badly underwritten. Especially Riz Ahmed's character whom is an utterly one note evil. Still, Ahmed does alright job in acting. As for the other performances. It was a mixed bag. Even the Stan Lee's cameo was awkwardly put in. How is that possible!? However, Tom Hardy is perhaps the most baffling with his half-baked Woody Allen impressive for Eddie Brock. His frequent slurred mutterings doesn't seem reporter like. Nevertheless, he was a lot better than Topher Grace's appearance in 2007's 'Spiderman 3' movie that's for sure. Overall: I have to say, my spider senses were indeed tingling. While, I wouldn't be as venomous as other critics, the film was not as enjoyable as it should had been. Even the two post credits were not well bonded to go see in theaters. Sadly, it's only good, as a rental.",Venom
41,Platypuschow,Venom: Saved by something it wasn't supposed to have,6,6 December 2018,"When I heard about a Venom movie, I was excited.
When I heard Hardy was to play Brock, I was concerned.
When I saw the trailer, I lost all interest.But truth be told, it wasn't as bad as feared but it certainly isn't everything it should have been.With a heavily modified version of Venoms origin story this R rated movie separate from the Marvel Universe is a watchable but ultimately uninspired affair.When I first heard about the film it was said to not only be R-Rated but delving into the realms of horror. Truth be told the end product is not horror, it's comedy. The idea of Venom being a comedy is insane, yet is the only reason I rated the film as highly as I have.It's actually quite funny and instead of the badass in the comics Eddie Brock is a loveable loser type that Hardy played considerably well.A major cgi-fest this 100 million costing Hollywood effort is saved by the humour it simply shouldn't have even had.The story is generic, it really has nothing very original to offer but a fair few laughs make it more watchable than by all rights it should have been.Venom is better than I expected.
Hardy is better than I expected.
But it's certainly not the Venom movie we wanted nor deserve.The Good:Some great action sequencesQuite funny, oddlyThe Bad:Tom HardyAnother ""Tweaked"" origin storySome of the sfx are actually quite badThings I Learnt From This Movie:I don't remember Eddie Brock being a comedy characterTom Hardy isn't entirely uselessJenny Slate > Michelle Williams",Venom
42,The-Sarkologist,Quite Fun,7,5 October 2018,"Now that Spiderman is back in the hands of Marvel, well sort of, it looks as if Sony needs to start digging around with what's left to see if they can turn it into a franchise. Well, they've had two shots at Spiderman, one one of them did have Venom pop in as a sort of bad guy, but it seems that he now has his own movie, albiet a much darker one. Basically the story is that we have this evil billionaire who found some parasites in space and decided to bring them back to Earth. However the ship crashed and one of them managed to escape. The other three though made it back to San Francisco.
 Then we have our hero, who happens to be a reporter, and it seems that everything is going right for him, expect that he decides to start digging where he shouldn't be digging, and suddenly finds himself out of work and without a girlfriend. I guess that's what happens when an investigative reporter is just a little too good at their job, and also asks just one too many questions that they shouldn't be asking - billionaires, especially evil ones, have a really nasty habit of making life really, really difficult for you.
 However, it turns out that he is given another chance to start digging up some dirt on this guy, namely because one of his scientists decides that she really doesn't like, well, ignoring the rules, so she sneaks him into the lab, where he suddenly finds himself in the same room with one of the parasites, and is subsequently infected. So, he we have it, the Venom origin story. You can probably guess what happens from there though - he faces the bad guy, almost dies, but is eventually successful and things start getting back on track. Sure enough, we also have Stan Lee and a mid-credits scene that sort of teases us for the next film in the series.
 The thing that caught me with Venom though was that it didn't seem to be all that long. Look, that isn't a bad thing, and sometimes short movies can actually be pretty good movies, particularly since they drop all of the really boring stuff out of it. Yeah, this film was actually quite fun, though I did find that the Venom costume was just a little too tacky for my tastes. I would say that I liked the story, and the character, but when it came to Venom being Venom, well, it did come across a little bit too cartoonish, but then again I suspect that it is somewhat closer to the comics than the MCU heroes.",Venom
43,jacobjohntaylor1,Good movie,7,11 October 2018,This is a good movie. It is very scary. It has a great story line. It has best acting ever. Spider man 3 is better. But is a lot better then Avengers infinity war that is just overrated crap. This is a very good movie. Spider man Homecoming is better.

44,ops-52535,tom hardys thousand faces of acting,10,28 November 2018,"Well this was a great movie, perfect length,perfect cast,good storyline,and a very atypical tom hardy for once. ive not had much admiration towards mr.hardys previous acting, but after having seen,venom and locke, he really shows what a great character actor he is. in venom he shows his bewildered and comic talents, had a few laughs i must admit.he really has a rubber face with thousands of expressions,and should hit back to the comedy again.
so if you are bored of the marvel brand and the way they make superhero movies, well then venom is quite an exception and very unusual film. its highly recommended",Venom
45,UniqueParticle,Love this movie so much for what it is!,10,21 August 2019,I must say it would've been a thousand times better if it was R-Rated like it was supposed to! I saw this in the theater originally in IMAX which is so damn good even as a PG-13 film plus I love deep voices as weird they may seem. Im a huge Tom Hardy fan and horror aficionado so I dig this I even got some of the comics afterwards not too long ago.,Venom
46,paulclaassen,"Well made, but offers nothing new.",6,24 December 2018,"I have mixed feelings about this one. Ok, so by now you probably know I'm not a big fan of superhero movies, and especially American superhero films. I must admit, this one had a lot more depth and Tom Hardy was really good as the protagonist. He goes through an unfortunate break-up due to circumstances, and then attempts to rekindle his relationship, but to no avail. So I really rooted for and felt sorry for the guy. I suppose one could refer to him as a loser. And this plays a pivotal role later in the film, so the setup was very well done.The make-up and visuals are incredible, but unfortunately the film becomes so CGI-heavy that all the depth is blown right out the window. It becomes nothing more than a typical Hollywood CGI superhero fare that doesn't feel fresh and new. Instead, it feels like a rehash of a plot we've seen so many times before, with a predictable ending. The film also felt a lot like a more extreme version of 'Upgrade' starring Logan Marshall-Green.Although it was by now means a bad film, it wasn't that great or special either, and chances of me giving it a second viewing is very slim.",Venom
47,John6Daniels,Meh!,3,15 October 2018,"I knew this was going to fail 2 years ago. I was going wait for the dvd like I do to all films that look like grabage but due to circumstances I saw it in theaters and it wasn't BAD. And it wasn't near good. Its just an okay bad movie that doesn't need to be seen again.The main problem is the pacing. The pacing was too fast. There is no build up, some scenes just happen for the sake of happening and lack of better character development.The acting was fine.Like most films they always have that annoying lead female character. This film is no different. The Lead Female has a couple moments where you want her to just die.CGI was meh.Overall the only good thing about the movie is the mid credit scene.",Venom
48,tomgillespie2002,Takes the genre back 15 years,3,14 December 2018,"I don't recall ever seeing Tom Hardy attempt comedy, but he's in full Ace Ventura mode in Venom, Sony's latest (and successful) attempt to squeeze the dollars out of what few Marvel characters that remain under their ownership. After failing to reboot Spider-Man and coming to an agreement with Marvel Studios to share the character, Sony have been left with the web-slinger's rogue gallery, and with some kind of anti-superhero universe clearly in mind, they have kicked events off with their most popular villain, the hulking and long-tongued Venom. You may remember the character from the franchise-killing Spider-Man 3 in 2007, and you also may believe you've gone back in time over 10 years when watching this spectacularly dull and frustratingly origin story, which harks back to the dark days of the Ben-Affleck-headlined Daredevil and Tim Story's Fantastic Four.A spaceship launched by the shadowy Life Foundation crashes down to Earth carrying four symbiotic alien lifeforms gathered from a nearby comet. Three are retrieved by the Foundation's Elon Musk-esque CEO Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) and taken back to their San Francisco research facility for experimentation, but one escapes, latching itself on to an ambulance driver before hopping between various people in an attempt to find a suitable host. Enter Eddie Brock (Hardy), an investigative journalist who trades in exposing and bringing down corrupt organisations. When given the chance to interview Drake, Eddie naturally uses the opportunity to question the entrepreneur about some of the horrific allegations, including experimenting on humans. The interview is cut short, and soon Eddie finds himself fired and split from his fiancee Anne (Michelle Williams). He sees the chance to redeem himself when a disgruntled Life employee gives him access to their labs, which turn out to be holding cells for symbiote testing on the homeless. The rest you can guess: a symbiote finds its way onto Eddie and he spends the rest of the film dealing with newly-acquired powers (and taste for human heads).Marvel Studios have got the formula down to a tee, endearing superheroes to millions of new fans who had never touched a comic-book in their lives. It's somewhat sad to see Venom try to take the genre back more than a decade, when many studios were under the impression that the only way an audience will buy into a world of superpowers is through forced humour. The MCU balances humour and drama in a way that almost guarantees your emotional investment, and if you're going to go for all-out comedy like Ant-Man or Thor: Ragnarok, y'know, make it funny. The sight of Hardy cooling down in a lobster tank or flashing expressions of gormless confusion for nearly two hours does not make for pleasing entertainment. The actor is incredibly bad, and his choice to go with a mumbled accent and hunched posture means that his character fails to convince as a journalist with serious credentials. The remainder of the cast don't fare much better, although its hardly their fault. It's a thankless role for Williams, who is given little to do other than playing the role of Eddie's conscience, and Ahmed has no dimension to play around with as the stock soulless corporate type. The climax is a forgettable smack-down featuring two indistinguishable CGI creations, something The Incredible Hulk did far better ten years ago. Despite all of this, Ruben Fleischer's bland fossil of a film raked in over $800 million worldwide, so I'm afraid a sequel is inevitable.",Venom
49,Thanos_Alfie,Nice movie...,7,30 October 2018,"""Venom"" is another Marvel movie in which we watch Eddie Brock a reporter trying to acquire the powers of a symbiote when he is possessed by it. He will have to fight very hard with it and with himself in order to release it or co-operate with it. Its name is Venom and it will do everything to keep living and surviving on Earth as all symbiotes do.Despite all the bad critics I have to say that I enjoyed this movie and I had a really great time watching it. The plot was very interesting and not boring with some plot twists which made it even more interesting to watch. I also liked Tom Hardy's interpretation despite my first thoughts when his name was announced for the role of Venom. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Riz Ahmed's who played as Carlton Drake / Riot and he was very good at it. I have to admit that I expected more from Michelle Williams who played as Anne Weying and in my opinion made an average interpretation. The direction that was made by Ruben Fleischer was very interesting with many good scenes where there was a very good combination of action and adventure. Regarding Tom Hardy's interpretation, it has to be stated that it was so good that he made the audience feel all the stress, pain and the unknown when Venom was inside him and that's I believe the most important thing.Finally, I have to say that ""Venom"" is not just an average movie but a very interesting one, with good visual effects and CGI's, nice interpretations and a well-written script. If you are a Marvel fan I am sure that you won't be disappointed by it, but even if you are not, do yourself a favor and don't listen to all these bad critics and reviews, just watch it and I am sure that you won't regret it. So, I recommend everyone to watch it for all the previous reasons.",Venom
50,cruise01,Absolutely fun and exciting and Tom Hardy is awesome as the antihero Venom.,8,6 October 2018,"Venom (4 out of 5 stars).Venom is an awesome antihero character that got his own movie after having a cheesy appearance in Spider-man 3. Venom does make up for it. Sony trying to create their own universe with their own superhero films. The movie is awesome with Tom Hardy taking the role and the action sequences are top notch exciting. It does suffer from a boring villain and a thin plot but it could have been a whole lot worse. The plot follows a space probe crashing down on earth with a corporation Life foundations trying to reclaim four symbiotic lifeforms. Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) is leading Life foundations and only discovered three symbiotic contained while one is missing. Meanwhile, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is a journalist reporter talking about current issues about our todays problems. His fiancée Anne (Michelle Williams) is an employee of Life foundations and he decides to use her intel to interview Drake about people being test subjects for his experiments. When the interview goes bad with Brock losing his job, relationship, and his life's work. An insider decides to help Brock get inside Life foundation to gather evidence of Drake's evil experiments with people. Brock gets infected from a symbiotic known as Venom. With Drake and his paramilitary after Brock. Brock soon learns to cooperate with his alter ego of Venom to fight the bad guys.The film's plot was pretty thin. The first act is a bit slow with Brock living poorly after he lost everything. And Drake becoming a mad scientist with experimenting using symbiotes on people. Trying to find a perfect host for the symbiotes. Until, Brock becomes Venom than the rest of the movie is Drake having his men chase him down. And the villain's plan on sending another space probe into space. Riz Ahmed was not as intriguing as the villain Carlton Drake. He plays like a mad scientist that is obsessed with trying to find the perfect human being that can host a symbiote. Venom does face off against another symbiote known as Riot which was cool. Especially, during the chaotic fight in the climax. Tom Hardy is great as Eddie Brock/Venom and he also voices Venom. It is pretty cool to see Eddie battling with himself as Venom's voice bickers at him. That is were the fun begins in the movie. When Eddie notices his appetite has increased. And he thinks he is going insane with the voice in his head. He is running around the street and restaurant with his maniac behavior. When the bad guys show up and Venom takes over to fight them off. It is pretty cool. There is also thrilling motorcycle chase. And Venom battling through a SWAT team. And the climax battle with Riot. Michelle Williams was good as Anne, Brock's ex's love interest. The visual effects were great with Venom. The motorcycle chase scene may have some cheesy effects but it's almost unnoticeable. Overall, Venom is a good superhero film. The action sequences are awesome. It is nice to see Venom fighting bad guys/ even some gritty scene were he bites their heads off. Seeing Eddie and Venom talk their differences is fun. Tom Hardy is great as the character. The plot may be thin and have a boring villain like Carlton Drake. Still makes an entertaining superhero movie.There is also a mid credit scene that foreshadows for a sequel villain. And a post credit scene which sony is marketing their other animated superhero film which I do not think it is important to the Venom universe.",Venom
51,Floated2,Tom Hardy delivers but Venom does not,4,7 May 2019,"Tom Hardy is one of Hollywood's more likable and great current actors, where we can watch him in something subpar and come away feeling satisfied due to his performance alone. This was somewhat the case for Venom. He did a great job as the lead role but the writing of the film felt bizarre and we are left with a film that should have been much better than what it was.Venom made a lot of money at the box office and is getting a sequel, but this film has divided critics and causal audiences. It's current Rotten tomatoes critics score is 29%, while the audience score is 81%. So that's to say this is a film where the audience saw something completely different than the critics. And which is why many of these IMDB reviews, we see titles with ""Ignore the critics"" or ""The critics are wrong"".Overall, Venom is decent fun but not great at all. The story line and plot is too predictable and at times unintentionally funny. The action is okay. This movie most likely would have been better with an R-rating for violence, but of course given its PG-13 rating, it was very toned down. The good thing is, a sequel is coming next year so it will give the studios a chance to get it right. It can't be as underwhelming as this.",Venom
52,eddie_baggins,Hardy almost saves the day!,5,7 October 2018,"There's no doubt that Venom is lightyear's away from being a good film (it's also more entertaining than a fair few haters have made it out to be) but thanks to the tireless work of its leading man, Ruben Fleischer's film almost overcomes its various flaws to be the killer off-kilter comic book movie fans were clamouring for.More than likely victim of studio interference in the end-game (star Tom Hardy only recently made headlines suggesting around 40 minutes of the film was left on the cutting room floor), Venom struggles hard to find its grove between generic comic book origin story 101, anti-hero trying to do good and a big bad that is so tiresome and eye-rolling that it's hard to care much at all but it never stops Hardy from giving it his all as reporter turned alien host Eddie Brock. Fighting against a film that wastes its large budget on tiresome and forgettable action scenes (the film generally lacks a good set-piece), amateur editing and a thoroughly boring support cast led by Michelle Williams, Jenny Slate and Riz Ahmed, Hardy dives head first into his role and tries to single handily give Venom the spark it needed to succeed in embracing its zaniness. Much like Ryan Reynolds slipping into the Deadpool suit like a match made in movie heaven, Hardy feels like the man made to be Brock/Venom and as his down on his luck reporter begins his life as a duel being, Fleischer's film shows glimpses of what could've been had the studio had the guts to commit itself to joining Hardy in going after the true spirit of this creation. It's often laugh out loud hilarious seeing Hardy learning to deal with the new voice in his head (ever wanted to see Hardy sit in a tank full of live lobsters fully clothed?) and his new powers and at various times in these instances Venom becomes a genuinely funny and excitingly fresh feeling comic book movie but these instances are always fleeting as Fleischer's lifeless directing and Venom's tired plotline take hold once more. Fleischer's whose been in a funk since his breakout hit Zombieland allows Venom to truly become one of the most glaringly obvious cases of an actor trying their best to elevate a film they're in in quite some time and one hopes that as the film turns a profit, Hardy will stick around for further adventures that hopefully learn from the mistakes made here as this property feels far from D.O.A should the studio and future filmmakers match their actor at his game. Final Say - There's a lot wrong with Venom and its following of the rule book is both tiresome and unfortunate but there's no denying Hardy's brilliantly bonkers lead turn is worth the price of admission alone, even if everything else in Fleischer's film leaves much to be desired. 2 ½ newspaper vendors out of 5",Venom
53,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,6,25 November 2018,"Venom is not the story of Eddie in the spider man movies. Actually, after the third spiderman, I really wanted to see a better presentation of Eddie and his parasite. The movie starts slow, with a super hero theme that everyone knows and has watched somewhere else (good guy hits low when a bad guy who seemed like the good guy plots against humanity). The best part of the movie comes later, when Venom takes over. Venom's character was the best, he provided enough laughter and actions scenes, as well as mystery. So, Venom was fun, Eddie, not so. But, overall, it was an enjoyable movie, though, not the best.",Venom
54,Rectangular_businessman,An underrated superhero flick,8,15 October 2018,"I honestly enjoyed Venom much more than most of those ridiculously overhyped superhero films from the recent years, which despite being inspid and formulaic tend to have raving reviews, while this movie got plenty of hate from the critics.But at least I am glad to see audiences genuinely enjoyed this movie, because, despite having a couple of awkward moments, this was genuinely interesting to watch, instead of merely being the same regurgitated crap of always: This must be the result of the inclusion of horror elements in this story, and while I wish this movie had been rated R as it was originally planned, the result is still satisfying anyway.I'm still not entirely sure about this whole ""Spider-verse"" idea (Why all the movies have to be part of a ""serialized universe"" these days?) but at least Venom was step in the right direction in my opinion.",Venom
55,leonblackwood,Could have been much better! 6/10,6,14 February 2019,"Review:
A lot of people were pretty disappointed with this movie, especially the die-hard comic book fans who were expecting to see a connection to Spider-Man, but I actually enjoyed the film, even though the storyline was a bit sketchy. The acting wasn't that great but the CGI was top form, and the action scenes were great. I was expecting an intense performance from Tom Hardy, like most of his movies, but the director chose to go down the comedy root, which didn't quite work in my opinion. I didn't quite understand why Hardy was talking to Venom out loud, which made him look like he had serious mental problems. A lot of time was wasted on Hardy trying to control the inner demon, which he still didn't pin down until the end, and no one seemed that surprised that there was a scary monster going around San Francisco causing complete carnage. Once again, they overcomplicated the plot, which could have been simplified if they cut out all of the technical jargon. Anyway, I will try and explain what happens at the beginning but you have to bear with me because it's quite baffling. While exploring space for new habitable worlds, a probe belonging to the bio-engineering corporation Life Foundation discovers a comet covered in symbiotic lifeforms. The probe returns to Earth with four samples, but one escapes and causes the ship to crash in Malaysia. The Life Foundation recovers the other three and transports them to their research facility in San Francisco, where they discover that the symbiotes cannot survive without oxygen-breathing hosts, which often fatally reject the symbiosis. Investigate journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) lives with his fiancée Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), an attorney at the law firm representing the Life Foundation. While Anne is sleeping, Eddie logs on to her computer and learns about these human trials from a confidential document he finds after accessing her work email. Eddie uses the information to publicly confront Life Foundation CEO Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), about the trials, leading to both Eddie and Anne being fired from their jobs. Consequently, Anne ends their relationship. Six months later, Eddie is approached by Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate), one of Carlton's scientists who disagrees with his methods and wants to expose him. She helps Eddie break into the research facility to search for evidence, and he learns that an acquaintance of his, a homeless woman named Maria, is one of the test subjects. Eddie attempts to rescue Maria, but the symbiote possessing her transfers to his body without him realising, leaving her dead. He reaches out to Anne for help, and her new boyfriend, Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott), discovers the symbiote on examining Eddie. Carlton exposes Skirth to the remaining captive symbiote, which ultimately dies. This leaves the symbiote inside Eddie as the only known surviving specimen. Carlton sends mercenaries to retrieve the symbiote from Eddie, but it manifests around his body as a monstrous creature that fights off the attackers. It later introduces itself to Eddie as Venom and explains that the comet is searching for planets where the symbiotes can possess and devour the inhabitants. Venom offers to spare Eddie if he helps the symbiotes achieve their goal, and Eddie comes to enjoy the superhuman attributes that the symbiote imbues him with. Eddie breaks into his old workplace to turn in evidence of Drake's crimes, but is surrounded by SWAT officers and is forced to transform to escape. Anne witnesses this transformation and takes Eddie back to Lewis's office, where they explain that the symbiote is slowly rotting Eddie's internal organs. Eddie notes that the symbiote has two weaknesses: high-pitched noises and fire. Although Venom claims that the organ damage can be prevented, Anne uses an MRI Machine to help Eddie separate from the symbiote. Eddie is then captured by Carlton's men. Meanwhile, the fourth symbiote, Riot, makes its way from Malaysia to San Francisco by hopping from body to body. It bonds with Carlton, who agrees to take Riot in a Life Foundation space probe to collect the rest of the symbiotes and bring them to Earth. Anne reluctantly bonds with Venom so they can free Eddie. When Eddie and Venom have bonded again, the latter states that he has been convinced to help protect the Earth from his kind through his interactions with Eddie, and the pair attempt to stop Riot and Carlton with Anne's help. Venom damages the probe as it takes off, causing it to explode and kill both Riot and Carlton. Anne believes Eddie is no longer bonded to Venom after this, and that Venom also died in the explosion. However, the pair remain secretly bonded and set out to protect San Francisco by killing criminals. The ending was quite interesting because you get to see the introduction of Carnage, played by Woody Harrelson in an extremely weird wig. With a sequel planned to be released in 2020, after the success at the box office of this movie, I hope that Hardy gains control of Venom, so they can get straight on with the action. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch if you're into your comic book movies, but it's not in the same league as the Avengers. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Ruben Fleischer, who also brought you Gumball 3000: 6 Days in May, Zombieland, 30 Minutes or Less and Gangster Squad. With 8 movies in development, including Jekyll starring Chris Evans and a sequel to Zombieland called Zombieland: Double Tap, the director for the sequel to Venom hasn't been named yet, but I personally hope that it goes to someone who has more experience in this genre. I was hoping for a more edgier Hardy, mainly because Venom looks so scary and the concept is quite deep, but the director made him seem like a gullible weakling, which didn't suit his persona. Although this is a Marvel movie, it's the first film in Sony's Marvel Universe, an adjunct to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which might explain why it wasn't everyone's cup of tea. I just hope that the sequel meets everyone's expectations!Budget: $100million

56,TheMovieDiorama,Venom is just a poisonous outdated cash grab.,3,11 October 2018,"Oh dear. Superhero fatigue really is hitting hard this year. Sony is attempting every possibility just to keep the rights of a superhero intellectual property that is ""in association with Marvel"". Trying to kickstart yet another cinematic universe. I have no objections for these kind of blockbusters. As long as they entertain, they serve their purpose. This though, this is the complete opposite of entertainment. It's a catastrophic symbiotic mess. Eddie Brock, a well renowned journalist, loses everything by undertaking one interview. A few months later, he encounters a extraterrestrial life form known as Venom, where the two must stop another ""symbiote"" from destroying the world. Subjectively speaking, this is the worst blockbuster of the year for all the wrong reasons. But, let's start the review with some much needed positivity. Hardy, although incredibly miscast, commands onscreen presence and gives Brock a layer of likability. His schizophrenic-like behaviour with Venom manages to remain amusing, albeit frequently forced, reminiscent of the ""Buddy cop"" sub-genre. Venom, an anti-hero who suddenly turns into the world's saviour, maintains an enigmatic quality that feels alluring. Stan Lee's cameo is always a delight? I may be clutching at straws here for positive aspects, particularly with that last comment. There are so many underlying issues with Venom, that detailing them all would be a challenge in itself. Firstly, the narrative is tonally inconsistent. We have traits of the comedic 'Deadpool', action from 'The Incredible Hulk' and obviously the structure of 'Spider-Man'. It's not even inconsistent by scene, every act is so vastly different in tone that it doesn't feel like a complete film. Starting off as a generic romance, then breaking into the generic ""buddy cop"" action whilst also attempting to embed dark humour that forcibly feels negatively hilarious. The reason for this is the bad editing. Hardly any of the scenes have a narrative flow, with specific points in the plot being inserted at the incorrect time.This is particularly noticeable when portraying the antagonistic Carlton Drake, who's motives and backstory are thrown around like a ""symbiote"" on a rocket burning up through the atmosphere. One moment he wants to save humanity, the immediate proceeding scene portrays him wanting to destroy it. The horrifically written script, accompanied by unfunny quips that did not suit Hardy's acting talent, relies on an outdated superhero formula. Sony have failed to realise that these films have substantially evolved since the early 2000's. The ""save the world"" cliché and formulaic origin story are buried. Formulaic is an understatement, the story is atrociously predictable with its one-dimensional characters and heroic clichés that even the infrequent action scenes (all two and a half of them) couldn't generate any entertainment. The final showdown was a CGI ball of mess, making it particularly difficult to see what was actually happening. The motorbike segment was too pedestrian and lacked any excitement. Any combat scenes felt clunky and cumbersome, despite the innovative stunt choreography between Hardy and Venom. Ahmed gave a generically dull performance as the villain, one that I shan't remember anytime soon. Williams tried her best but again felt miscast as she attempts to create an emotional layer of depth between herself and Hardy. Oh, and Slate was underused, considering she has the most involving character. The slight comedic quips that Brock and Venom share are excruciatingly cringe inducing, trying so hard to make the audience laugh. There comes a point when Venom says ""pussy"", and I face-palmed so hard.Then we come to my favourite criticism of all. Plot conveniences. How did Drake know that Brock got the information from his girlfriend, leading to her firing? Venom was set on leaving Earth, how and why did Brock suddenly change his perspective? Why would he stay? (Don't even say because they are both ""losers""). How did Weying know to operate the speaker system at the launch pad? How did Venom survive? And why do megalomaniacs constantly keep killing their employees? Trust me, I really wanted to enjoy this. I went in with the best of intentions. But it's just not good. Completely outdated, utterly formulaic and so close to equalling the catastrophic disaster that was 'Fant4stic'. If it wasn't for Hardy giving a crazy Nicholas Cage performance by jumping into a fish tank brimming with lobsters at a restaurant, this would have nothing remotely amusing. Venom failed to find an antidote and instead succumbed to the poisonous traits of corporation cash grabbing by injecting no imagination or effort into the film, marking an all-time low in Hardy's career.",Venom

59,southdavid,Brock Less-Nah!,4,9 October 2018,"The early criticism I read about ""Venom"" included something I feel really rings true having seen it. It does feel very much what superhero films were like 15 years ago, before Marvel took control of their own destiny and began to make films of different genres, with their characters in them, rather than believing that ""Superhero"" is a genre itself. This is a regression to a time when a bit of CGI and a superhero name was enough to get people to go. It's not that world anymore and ""Venom"" comes up sadly lacking. To sum up the plot, whilst investigating the shady science of tech Billionaire Carlton Blake (Riz Ahmed) journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is exposed to an Alien Symbiote named Venom. The two eventually form an uneasy alliance as Brock tries to take down Blake and Venom hunts for Riot, a fellow Symbiote who wishes to bring about the end of humanity. I want to split my criticism in two now. Some for the character of Venom and some for the film itself. I'll start with the film. With any character as the protagonist of it, this film would be a bit of a mess. It takes a long time to get going, it ends with an anticlimactical incoherent CGI battle that looks awful, but worst of all, is inconsistent across its running time about its own rules. Sometimes, bonding with an alien creates a zombie like status in the human, with the symbiote in full control, sometimes the connection results in a sickness for the human (though it is explained that the alien essentially eats the host from the inside, if they aren't fed) but sometimes, it creates a perfect symbiotic relationship immediately, where the human gains extraordinary powers and they share the same goals - fortunately for the dull plot, this is the case for all three of our leads. One thing that some people may like is that the film is a story in itself, there are no links to any pre-existing universes and very few Easter Eggs beyond nods to the creators. Personally, I like those little insider nods and the film felt worse for it. The CGI is bad, the music is worse and the practical stunts are underwhelming. The portrayal of Venom himself is an odd one. Giving them an internal (and sometimes external) monologue was a way to go - and sometimes it's funny, is it always trying to be?. . I'm not sure, but there are laughs to be had there. Hardy is very game to make himself look foolish, and the voice he provides for Venom is interesting. However, I don't really buy into why Venom suddenly decides to side with the humans against the other symbiotes, surely not one brief moment considering the beauty of and Earth city wasn't it? If it's the influence of Eddie Brock's humanity, why doesn't that work in the other combinations? Eventually, just as the film was ending, the ""pairing"" began it hit their rhythm, so much so that if they made another ""Venom"" film that could fix the problems I detailed in the previous paragraph, I'd be willing to see it. I wasn't disappointed, as the critical response prior to seeing it had dulled my anticipation but I'd genuinely struggle to recommend the movie to anyone, fan or otherwise of the character.",Venom
60,Vartiainen,Competent superhero film with a sense of humour,6,25 November 2018,"First of all, ignore the critics. 29% on Rotten Tomatoes, as of this writing, is way too low for this film. It isn't a masterpiece, I'm not saying that, and it is a bit formulaic, but it is nevertheless a good, solid superhero film with an added bonus of a grungy sense of humour.Tom Hardy plays the lead as Eddie Brock, a celebrated investigating journalist, who has fallen on hard times after he reached too far with a story. But that same story, trying to expose a bleeding edge tech company, comes back to haunt him when the company discovers an alien lifeform.Hardy is a very talented actor and that is once again shown here. The man has a lot of range and can perform both as a dramatic actor and as an action hero. Which are both needed here. I also like the fact that his character is very dirty in this film. Meaning that he is allowed to look wasted, down on his luck, beaten and defeated. Venom as a character in the comics is after all one of the most well-known antiheroes, which is reflected nicely in the mood of this film.I also like the humour very much. The film is PG-13, but a lot of the jokes are rather gruesome and raunchy for such a rating. And it makes sense with this character.And then the negatives, which I feel the critics took a bit too far, but even I have to admit that it's a pretty textbook story. You can easily tell how the story will go from the beginning, there are no great surprises and the villain is lackluster at best. I do believe that the character of Venom, the humour and some of the other side characters make up for this, but I can see why these can be a problem for some.Nevertheless, Venom is a great watch if you're looking for a superhero film that's a bit rough around the edges and that has gone a few rounds already.",Venom

Okay there are one or two moments where Hardy does overact a bit, but the moments between Eddie and Venom do play odd couple like thing. Michelle Williams I thought was gonna be non existent like she was in I feel Pretty, but really plays a bigger role than I figured. Effects where pretty good, action scenes are pretty tense.

You're constantly fighting the urge to look at the TV and yell ""That's not how it happened!""I don't think Eddie was as much of a scumbag as he should have been...but Hardy was far better than Grace. And they symbiote wasn't exactly as fun as it was in the comics...but then you only really heard one side of the conversation in the comics.For an origin story, it was fun...but with Venom being one of the best known Spidey characters, and with Spidey being one of the best known comic book characters...was an origin story necessary? Especially one that was going to change so much of the character?It could have easily started off after the origin and rolled along on its way as to not irk the fans of the comics.Despite all of that, it was a well balanced mix of amusing and dark, and those combinations usually tend to work...even if it didn't have the blood that gore that would have sent the film over the top in best possible way.You get your money's worth watching it.

64,stevendbeard,Alien Symbiote Anti Hero,8,6 October 2018,"I saw ""Venom"", starring Tom Hardy-The Revenant, The Dark Knight Rises; Michelle Williams-The Greatest Showman, Shutter Island; Jenny Slate-Hotel Artemis, This Means War and Riz Ahmed-Rouge One:A Star Wars Story, Jason Bourne.
This movie-in case you didn't know-is based on a comic book series about an alien symbiote anti hero. Most heroes don't like to bite people's heads off. In the comics, Venom was discovered on an alien world during the Secret Wars storyline by Spider_man and brought back to Earth. Spider_Man was it's first host body. The origin story is a little different here-no involvement of the web swinger. Here, Riz and his company bring back several specimens of the alien symbiotes from space. Riz thinks it would be a good idea to splice the alien with a human volunteer-and I use volunteer loosely here-to further his own hidden agenda. The problem is, the symbiotes have difficulty finding a suitable host to bond with-the humans keep dying. Tom is an investigative reporter that is on to Riz and his shady experiments but unfortunately, Tom gets infected with a symbiote named Venom-it seems that Tom was a good match. Yes, the symbiotes have different names, such as Riot and Scream-for those unfamiliar to the comics. Michelle plays Tom's girlfriend and Jenny plays one of Riz's scientist, that is not too happy with what they are doing with all these volunteers. The Venom character is CGI and Tom does Venom's voice in the movie-it is deeper but it is Tom doing it- and there is a big slugfest between Venom and Riot near the end of the movie. Stan Lee makes his usual cameo, of course, and as the end credits start, there are 2 scenes. The first one is right after the credits start and it involves a recognizable big name star as another character-possibly for the next movie?-and the second scene is after the end credits, so be sure to stay for it. It is really more of a trailer for the next Marvel movie coming in December.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci_fi violence/action and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes. FYI: It was originally supposed to be rated ""R"", like Deadpool was, but it was decided a ""PG-13"" rating would be more compatible with the Marvel Universe, in case they decided to have a crossover with Spider_Man.

68,alindsay-al,An average waste of potential,5,10 October 2018,"Now I am a big fan of the character of Venom but when I heard that this film was going to be made and it wasn't linked to the Marvel Cinematic Universe or Spider-Man I was worried. Though this film will not go down as one of the worst comic book films ever it certainly won't be remembered particularly fondly either. The premise of the film sees a down on his luck reporter uncover a huge story but gets infected by an alien Parasite. Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock and Venom in this film and he does a great job and is easily the best part of this film, he sells the split personality really well and just delivers a performance of high quality. The character of Venom is surprisingly interesting and actually a bit funnier then expected. However, the supporting cast is very small and just not interesting at all, Michelle Williams plays Hardy's ex in the film and I just didn't buy the chemistry between the two of them and didn't care about what was going on between them. Riz Ahmed plays the villain in this film and he is just horribly boring in this film, his character is just so cliche and by the numbers that he isn't a credible threat at all. When Hardy isn't on screen you just don't care about any of the other characters in the film. The story is interesting in the sense of the relationship of Eddie and the Symbiote and how that progresses in the film. But due to the circumstances the origin of Venom is changed up for this film and it is just very dull and it doesn't do a good enough job to make you care. The script actually has some funny scenes in it and the dialogue between Venom and Eddie is fun to watch, but there is no doubt some cheesy lines in the film and the drama never really hits the level that it really should. The style of the film is a mixed bag, Venom itself look really good with his CGI, however, the action scenes especially towards the end of the film is really hard to follow due to the amount of CGI. Also the pacing of this film is not very good, the first 30 mins of the film are not very good at all and it hurts the overall film. Overall this film is better then i thought it would be but it isn't worth a watch unless you are a big Venom fan.",Venom
69,CubsandCulture,It is like the comics. I guess that is a win?,5,29 December 2018,"This film is either a brilliant parody of a superhero origin story, or it is a the dumbest version of a superhero origin imaginable. It is loud, noisy, and chaotic. But it is also funny, fast paced and oddly involving. I am pretty sure I don't understand rules of the creatures and the interplay between Venom and Eddie is really obvious and cliche. It reminded me of Krieg in Borderlands 2 of all things through it is as an amusing here as there. A lot of this has to do with Hardy being perfect for the role.It is just hard for me to get over the dumbness present in the film and the ambiguity over it just being schlock or being self-aware schlock really hampers my enjoyment of the film. In that way it is very much like the comic character as Venom has always been either very stupid or brilliant at being stupid. Glad I listened to the critics and skipped this in the theater.

Looking as if someone just scrapped him off the floorboard of a cab, Hardy sinks every last tooth into the role, adding spark where there otherwise is none. The film plays as if it were edited w/a weedwhacker and never really shows any signs of life until over half way through when Brock bonds w/the title symbiote.

73,jimbo-53-186511,Ignore the pretentious critics - this is solidly entertaining,8,20 October 2019,"Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) works as a journalist, but upon accidentally exposing some 'dirt' on a company called Life Foundation he decides to interview the CEO Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). This all backfires on Eddie when his allegations are not backed up with proof and Brock is subsequently fired from his role. However, 6 months later he's given another chance to expose the truth about Drake's company when employee Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) decides to assist him in his investigations. But events take an unexpected turn when Brock falls victim to Drake's experiments and becomes Venom which ultimately puts Brock on a collision course with Drake himself...Despite Venom being a Marvel original film, in some ways the premise to this film reminded me of a film called Upgrade that I watched earlier this year (whereby both parties end up with some kind of AI which can control their thoughts and make them stronger). Scarily enough both of the main stars of each film bear an uncanny resemblance to one another which makes things all the more spooky.That being said, Venom is a very entertaining film with a likeable protagonist (Brock is a victim of circumstance rather than being a bad person) and therefore at no point did I take any sort of disliking to him. I felt Brock's struggle every step of the way (his initial resistant to Venom) is believable given his contrast in personality to Venom, but the film takes an interesting turn when Brock and Venom start to understand each other which is when a sort of surreal dynamic starts to evolve.Venom is a slow-burning film so you do have to be patient when waiting for the action to kick in; whilst the action sequences are never 'blow your mind' crazily brilliant they are good enough to hold your attention and I did find the action sequences to be satisfying and acted as a nice backdrop to the fairly decent origin story.Tom Hardy really needs no introduction having proved himself to be a very capable actor time and time again; here he is simply marvellous and doesn't put a foot wrong (he seems to be able to turn his hand to anything and I can't say enough good things about the man). Michelle Williams is good in support (and does prove pivotal in the second half of the film). Ahmed is good as the villain of the piece, but it's only these 3 players that make anything of the film.Venom is a very entertaining film as well as providing an interesting origin story and a strong performance by Tom Hardy. The film does have a light-hearted jokey feel to it (not surprising given it was directed by Ruben 'Zombieland and 30 Minutes or Less' Fleischer - incidentally I hated those 2 films and did not find them funny), but Fleischer seems to have got things right here (perhaps because the focus isn't all on comedy here - he's managed to fuse an original story and injected it with moments of comedy - mostly from Venom) and made it work.

76,kirbylee70-599-526179,HERO MIXTURE,9,4 January 2019,"If you're a fan of the Spider-man comic books then you know who Venom is. An alien at one time attached to Spider-man and then later transferred to tarnished news reporter Eddie Brock who blamed Spider-man for his lot in life. Thus he became the villain known as Venom. But most of that is abandoned for the movie version, VENOM, and it works well.A space shuttle owned by the Life Foundation is returning to Earth when something goes wrong. The shuttle crashes in Malaysia and all crew members save one are found dead. While being transported to a nearby hospital the sole survivor awakes, kills the ambulance crew and escapes on foot. Within the shuttle one container remained intact and is sent back to the home base for Life Foundation in San Francisco.Moving forward we find Brock (Tom Hardy) doing well for himself. He's about to marry the woman of his dreams Ann Weying (Michelle Williams) who works as an attorney for the Life Foundation and who has helped him score an interview with the CEO of the company Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). When Brock begins asking questions about human tests being done by the company the interview ends. The result is Drake ruining Brock's life, taking away his job and firing Ann who leaves him.Tests were being done on humans. It seems the container held an alien symbiote, a creature that attaches itself to a host in order to remain alive. The problem is finding a suitable host to match the creature. Non-matched subjects result in a terrible death with the symbiote seeking a new host.Months later, down on his luck, cowering at the least sign of danger and drinking away his life Eddie is approached by Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) who works for Life Foundation. Seeing the compulsive attitude and lack of care for life exhibited by Drake she wants to help Brock expose what's taking place. She sneaks him into the research facility where Brock recognizes a homeless friend being used. Breaking her free it turns out the symbiote is inside of her but transfers to Brock. Taking over he helps him escape the guards.Confused and frightened Brock reaches out to Ann for help. Now dating a doctor they both attempt to find out what's wrong with Brock having no clue about the symbiote. At the same time Drake and his black ops team are trying to find Brock as well. When push comes to shove the symbiote who calls himself Venom comes forward to protect Brock and take on the bad guys.While all of this is taking place remember the symbiote who escaped at the beginning of the film? It's made its way to San Francisco as well. Its intent is to use Drake to get what it wants, a way off the planet to reach the rest of his race with the intent of taking over the planet. Guess who stands in his way?The movie works on a number of levels here. The setup is easily understood and the demarcation lines between bad guys and good guys are set. At the same time when Venom makes his presence known he becomes an anti-hero of sorts, feeding on the bad guys he takes on, most often biting off their heads. Guess it shows that it doesn't pay to be a bad guy.But the movie has a unique combination of horror, action, comic book heroics and humor that works well and blends nicely. Brock complains and has no clue what's going on as Venom sprouts forth and takes over to go hand to hand with the black ops members. He isn't happy about being a repository for the creature either. But as the two combine and learn more about one another, as Venom helps heal the issues Brock has going on inside of him they come together to save the world or die trying. Venom even reveals something about himself I won't disclose here that makes them a perfect match.There is little doubt that the main thing driving this film is the current interest in comic book based films combined with special effects that would not have been possible to film when the comics first created the character. Yes the effects are amazing. But let's not forget that Hardy is an amazing actor and he brings to the Eddie Brock something we've not seen him do in the past. He makes the character not just human but funny at times. It makes for a more interesting character and Hardy makes it work spectacularly.A little bit of language will make this a movie that the smallest of children might want to bypass as well as the character being a bit frightening for tykes.

Venom looks fantastic & yes he's completely c.g.i but he looks AWESOME & he's not always fully visible he's often heard in eddies head talking to him & it's very funny.
The action is also fantastic & this movie has a great tone that's between sci-fi Horror & action comedy but it's done perfectly!!!Tom Hardy is truly one of the greats!!!
Also the funny relationship that develops between Eddie & his ex-fiancee & her new doctor boyfriend is hilarious & actually really sweet & lovely as there's no nastiness or jealousy between the three infact they try to help Eddie throughout the movie & it's great fun with great chemistry & great performances all around.Easily one of the best Marvel movies of all time infact probably my favourite & the fact VENOM is an ant-hero is what makes him cool & more fun than the usual heroes!!!

82,aidanratesmovies,To anyone who has seen my previous review: I was wrong,8,16 February 2019,"Hilarious and fast paced- Venom may be a bit by the numbers at times- but its execution is anything but the usual. First off, praise be to god for Tom Hardy in this role. No actor is more perfect as him for the Eddie Brock/Venom combo, and is truly the reason this film works so well. I'll be completely honest and say I didn't enjoy this film when I saw it in the theaters the first time around. Maybe I was in a bad mood, maybe I expected something much different, but given the recent slope of Marvel Studios films pitching almost identical ideals- and DC still doing much of the same- something as insane and fun as Venom is something I honestly long to see from more superhero flicks in the future. The action is spectacular and the CGI is perfect. Never have I seen such a perfectly done adaptation of a beloved character onto the bring screen as the look of Venom in this film. I will say this, the film can be a bit predictable at times. It follows a standard formula at times that you can recognize- something very eerie of earlier 2000's superhero flicks and not quite as fresh as it could have been. Its also just kinda stupid at times, and at times I honestly wondered if I was laughing cause the film was funny or because it was so dumb, but nevertheless I enjoyed it and all its ridiculousness with it. In the end, Venom is an underrated little superhero flick that gets too much hate for being something purely entertaining (even from myself apparently). No matter what flaws Venom may held, it makes up for them in spirit and charm, and is easily one of the most entertaining films i've seen in quite some time.My Rating: 8.5/10.",Venom

It's quite farcical and extreme and it may have been just the scenery and location, but some of it seemed like they were using 'Mrs Doubtfire' as a model for it.If it wasn't for the fact that Tom Hardy is my biggest celebrity crush, I might have turned it off before Venom even turned up.It's always a shame that with the first instalments/origin stories for these characters that they take so long to get started and established. That doesn't always mean that the sequel is any better, but it does cut out the explanation of where they get their powers and why they were such a hard luck story to begin with.It seems like it's the same format as a lot of others in this genre. A dangerous scientist with lots of money and big ideas that will do anything to prove how good he is and the little man who has to fight him. It's all quite predictable. I'd like to see them give it a bit more thought, consider what is already out there. Certainly it bares a strong resemblance to Ant-Man and most of the Spider-Man's, not least because the girlfriend is just another Mary-Jane.It's almost as if it had been made by DC instead of Marvel. It's definitely lacking the finesse of the majority of 'The Infinity Saga' and it's like a hybrid of 'Spidey' and 'Deadpool', but without the comedic talent or CGI budget. They didn't try hard enough to make it funny or they didn't make it serious enough, it fell flat in the middle.Venoms change of heart from his original plan is a bit crap and convenient too and barely even noticeable. I'm glad I was paying attention at that moment.If I hadn't seen Tom in 'Wuthering Heights' (2009) I might say that this is his worst character and production. I can only hope that as they have seen fit to make a second one, that they have given him a better story and script to work with. We all know that he, at least, is capable of so much better. It wouldn't hurt for him to be at least topless in the next one either.627.75/1000.",Venom
84,truemythmedia,The Funniest Movie of the Year,5,17 June 2019,"Though I've given this film a 2.5/5 star rating, it's a film that I actually intend to buy when it comes out, because I truly enjoyed myself during this movie (more so than some of the other recent Marvel movies even). As far as logic, acting, writing, directing, and overall craft, this movie is awful. In terms of enjoyment, this film is fantastically entertaining, though I really doubt I enjoyed it the way the filmmakers intended. If you're looking for a good superhero film, don't bother with this one. If you're looking for a lot of laughs and some truly baffling writing and scenarios, check out this movie- it's freaking hilarious.",Venom

86,AudioFileZ,Tom Hardy Brings It With Eddie Brock/Venom...Great Escapist Flick Here!,8,29 November 2018,"The ratings here are going up as I write this and it's obvious why. This is a movie just to blank out and enjoy which pretty much means a lot of movie critics will try to analyze it to death and miss the movie itself.First, the symbiote is like an amped up to 11 ""The Thing"" alien specie. That makes it a totally mean host eating machine. It can be killed or subdued with fire and ultra high sound frequency - Other than that it can super morph giving the writers and director a clean sheet of paper to explore. And they do when one of the most evolved of them uses Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock character for his purposes. Wild imagination on screen ensues.The juxtaposition of Tom being a loose canon borderline who, in spite of himself, has his heart in the right place. This creates an extraordinary ""new"" symbiote which Tom names Venom. Venom has decided instead of destroying earth he wants to hang around and take a new path. He still likes to eat people and Eddie gets his respect enough to make some ground rules. Venom can only eat the really bad humans who are a big part of the ugliness in what is actually a beautiful world Simple? Yes and its Tom Hardy that propels it in an excellent way. This is plenty dark with a large dose of wicked humor which actually makes it smart. Add in amazing CGI that tops it own self over and over. Amazing fight scenes and world class San Francisco car/motorcycle chase segment. There is eye-candy literally dripping all over the place here. Fittingly too we get Stan Lee's last cameo well placed at the end. Ignore any bad critical review, blank your mind, and hold on for a wild and fun ride.",Venom
87,masonsaul,Flawed but ridiculously fun,8,19 December 2018,"Venom is brought down by a surprisingly obvious plot hole but is still ridiculously fun. Tom Hardy gives a great and committed performance as both Venom and Eddie Brock. Despite little depth to his character, Riz Ahmed is really good and Michelle Williams is also really good. Ruben Fleischer's direction is also great, resulting in some really enjoyable and well made action sequences. The CG is also really good and it's consistently funny throughout.",Venom
88,robertemerald,Cutting edge graphics and superior acting,10,28 January 2019,"This movie asks a lot of its leads. The hero has to have his world continually crash down around him and remain a gentleman. Tick. The heroine has to have her heart broken, and often be shocked beyond any reason to forgive, and come up roses. Tick. The baddie has to maintain a veneer of control over increasingly diabolical circumstances challenging moralities all around him. Tick. It's a hard working movie. There is a lot of dialog. It's always fresh and witty. The dialog has to deal quickly with a new intruder. Tick. Is there humour? Plenty. So Venom succeeds as conventional theatre. From what I know of cgi and how its made my inexpert opinion is that this movie may represent something of a watershed moment in cinema, if not a technical apex. Recently I saw Terminator: Genesis and the particle graphics blew me away. Venom seems to go a step higher. The action is tremendous, a car chase so awesome you'll grip your armrests, and battles right at the outer edge of imagination. And all done so vividly well! From any point of view then, Venom is ten big ticks from me.",Venom

91,jadepietro,Dumbing and Numbing,5,6 January 2019,"GRADE: CTHIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Mr. Hardy is perfectly cast in an imperfect superhero film that is less than super.JIM'S REVIEW: Venom is yet another Marvel superhero movie with an unique antihero adjusting to his new superpowers. The plot follows a good man named Eddie Brock, an investigative reporter who crusades for humanitarian causes. He becomes infected by an alien parasite that wants Eddie to be its host in order to conquer our world. Capturing this symbiote invading mass is the main objective for Carlton Drake, a rich mad megalomaniac who want to control its power for genetic engineering purposes. Of course, good and evil will collide in a fight to the finish.The film quickly loses any logical sense...sometimes the parasite kills its host as it moves from victim to victim, other times it is comfortable in its temporary lodgings, or it leaves without any fatal effect. The screenplay-by-committee approach is evident in the script by Scott Rosenberg, Jeff Pinkner, and Kelly Marcel. It is standard storytelling in need of more dark humor and wit ala Deadpool.Conventionally directed by Ruben Fleischer, the film also is in need of better craftsmanship. The CGI is sub-par, the creature design looks artificial, the sound design is somewhat inaudible, and many of the action sequences are blurry and sloppily edited by Alan Baumgarten and Maryann Brandon.What almost saves the film is a darkly comic performance by Tom Hardy in the lead role. His physical reactions to his transformations from hell and back are priceless and provide the only fun in all of this heavy-handedness.The odd couple bantering between Eddie/Venom helps the film achieve some sort of strange buddy movie vibe.Otherwise, the actor stands alone. None of the other cast members register a glimmer of authenticity. In fact, the usually reliable and talented Michelle Williams as Eddie's girl, adds nothing but confusion to her under-written role and has little chemistry with Mr. Hardy. It is one of her weakest performances in her strong resume of films. As the villain, Riz Ahmed, a fine actor himself, lacks any real menace in his woeful role. And in the end credits, there is also a strange cameo by Woody Harrelson in a red fright wig that hints at his being the next villain in its sure-to-be-soon sequel.Enjoy Mr. Hardy. He is honestly the only thing worthy in this movie. This Venom numbs rather than stings.",Venom

93,rgkarim,This Venom Provides Laughing Side Effects,7,5 October 2018,"Marvel holds many cards in the world of Hollywood, and despite the hope of a united universe, Sony pictures still holds off in giving us a united front for our superhero crew. Tonight, a new contestant enters the park, not so much a hero as an antihero, this creature has pulled in a noble fanbase and inspired a number of other characters in the process. If you've got the hints you know what I'm reviewing, so let's get started as Robbie K reviews: Movie: Venom (2018)Director:
 Ruben Fleischer
Writers:
 Scott Rosenberg (screenplay by), Jeff Pinkner(screenplay by) 
Stars:
 Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Marcella Bragio 
LIKES: The Dark Aspect: You'll see a lot of jabs at this movie, but this installment at least gave us a taste of the darker side of the titular character. The movie dips into how not everything is gold in the realm of superpowers, as well as how grey everything can really be in the complex world of humans vs. the unknown. It also allowed for some more intense action scenes to come into play, including some finishes the fanbase has been looking forward to for some time. The Action... sort of: There are moments in Venom that feel well at home with MCU level style of battling. Venom has at least two winning sequences for me that have explosions, choreographed take downs of extras, and some sweet utilization of CGI to bring out Venom's fluid, whip like movements to bare. It's not the most dynamic, but it is miles above his first appearance back in Spiderman 3. Sound Editing: Probably not what most are looking for, I enjoyed the sound effects brought by the movie team. You've got the alien slithering, the roiling growls of the hungry beast, plenty of speaker shattering booms, and enough effects to wrap together to make for the action scenes. Tom Hardy: The star of the show and perhaps the best casting call for this movie, Hardy is certainly the leading component of his film. His ability to play an awkward, down on his luck, vigilante reporter is quite spot on, as well as the uncanny ability to play a crazy person as well. It came off naturally, held good chemistry with the rest of the crew, and certainly was entertaining to watch him interact with a digital, altered voice of Venom. I've said it before, but Hardy's ability to play any type of role continues to be present in his acting. Comedy: Like most Marvel movies, Venom is loaded with comedy to get you laughing and ironically may be the biggest aspect of the movie. Both intentionally and unintentionally, the movie had me laughing, primarily at the banter between Venom and Eddie Brock through much of the movie. The insults are on point, the delivery of the lines, and even Venom's questionable morals are all entertaining for this reviewer and probably the biggest point one should go in wanting to see. The End Credits Teaser: Not fully relevant to Venom, the post credit scene is worth the wait and hints at a huge potential for the next Sony-Marvel production coming in December. A little teaser to see if you want to take a trip into that. DISLIKES: The CGI: Still better than anything I could do, Venom didn't quite have the same definition and attention to detail that its Disney infused brothers do. The graphic are a bit messy, for although fluid, looks like living spaghetti trying to take form in many ways. Perhaps an homage to the early 2000s graphic style, Venom needed some upgrading to match the graphic expectations that the movie fans most likely desire. The Story: Hinting and promising so much in the trailer, Venom's story department does hit the dark aspect that this antihero demands. Yet, it still took shortcuts for this film, skipping over a lot of build-up, character development, and even just plot development to get to the goods and comedy I guess. Other characters are very one-dimensional and shallow, relationships are very fickle and seem to switch faster than a light switch, and in many cases crosses into cheesy proportions that didn't work for me. Grandiose displays may be something that younger audiences like,, but the story element still needs some tweaking to get to the Disney level. The Other Symbiotes: I get this was the start of the franchise, but the advertisements really hammered into us the potential to see other creatures more than Venom take some screen time. Sadly, they skimped on these as well, forcing to barely touch on these creatures before moving on to another poor plot point. Even the main antagonist in this film didn't get much time worth warranting, once more digging at the weaker storytelling of this studio. Even Venom took some time getting himself on screen, a sad use of merchandising rights when it could have been so much better. The Anticlimactic Action: Venom does have some nice action scenes as mentioned before, but the problem is that they are often short lived or very carbon copy. The chase scene showed promise, and the first-time combat had its moments, but they utilized their tricks a little too quickly. The ending promised a potential to have a real, epic clash of the Symbiotic titans going, but again Sony cut the corners and left me wanting more to show off their powers. Venom was very underpowered in this film, and they did little to utilize the keys handed to them. The props for the mid-credit scene: Actor choice for the surprise guest at the film is 50:50 to me, but the props to make him come to life... not very good for me. Should a Venom 2 make it to the big screen, I'm hoping their wardrobe department makes some better efforts to get the next antagonist in. The VERDICT: Go in expecting a comedy and you will love this movie and have the most fun. However, in regards to the full picture part of the film, it still has more to develop before it meets expectations set by Disney. Hardy and some mediocre action scenes can bring some entertainment, but it doesn't quite hit the home run outside of that. It's a bit cheesy at times, a little overboard in terms of the comedy, and doesn't quite deliver on the action, other symbiotes or even the story. Yet, it has enough special effects kicks to warrant a theater visit, but only if you can handle the limitations mentioned. My scores are: Action/Horror/Sci-Fi: 6.5
Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0",Venom
94,invisibleunicornninja,Pretty Great,9,21 October 2018,"So before watching this movie, I watched and read a lot of critic reviews of the movie. I was expecting this movie to be ""so bad that its good"" or something, but instead I ended up watching a genuinely good movie. Like 90% of what I've heard from critics is just made up. Most of the things I've heard pointed out as being plot holes are explained in the movie or just don't happen? I've heard a lot of people say that the final fight scene is confusing and hard to follow, but its not? If you watch it and are paying attention, its really easy to follow. Some people say that Anne is a bad love interest even though she isn't even the love interest. Someone said that Tom Hardy mumbles all his lines even though he doesn't. I've heard that the villain is really bad. While he isn't the greatest villain ever, his motivations make sense and he's well acted. Pretty much every negative review boils down to someone watched the trailer, made up what they thought would happen in the movie, and then gave the movie a low rating. I will admit though, the trailer looks really bad. The CG on Venom in the movie looks pretty good, but in the trailers it looks horrible. I don't know how that happened.Overall, this is a very entertaining rom-com and I would highly recommend it. The fight scenes are great. The characters are interesting and entertaining. The relationship between Eddie and Venom is nice. I'm definitely looking forward to a sequel.",Venom
95,justin-fencsak,Forget what the critics said about this film..it's a fun ride!!!,8,27 December 2018,"This movie when it came out, it broke records for a movie released in October, which was later broken again by Halloween 2018. It legged out pretty well and is now available on home media for your enjoyment. Even though the movie is quite short, an hour and a half of action plus 20 minutes of credits along with a teaser for the Spider Verse movie, it's still worth the price of a rental. If you grew up reading the Venom solo comic books from the 90s, then you'll enjoy this movie. The Venom in this movie is much better than the Venom that was introduced in Spiderman 3, which was the last great spiderman movie until homecoming brought the magic back. Even though it's rated PG-13, i think it's more between a pg-13 and an r rating since there's crude humor and some wacky stuff going on. Make sure you turn on subtitles or else you'll have a hard time hearing what Tom Hardy's character says...",Venom
96,Kingslaay,Decent: A different kind of Marvel film,7,11 November 2018,"Venom doesn't deserve all the negative reviews it has received. It isn't a slam dunk but it's not half bad either. Tom Hardy is great as usual and this film has some strong points. It was new to see a scary and big creature feature as an unusual hero. We are used to seeing prettier characters with fancy weapons. Venom chooses to be different and does an okay job of it. The humor is nicely done and the plot is decent enough and worthy of the marvel franchise.A few tweaks could have made this film fantastic. A more developed backstory for Hardy, also his decline is just too fast. In minutes he is fired and his fiance leaves him. Also the origins of Venom and its species could have got screen time. Any other Marvel film would have devoted 10-15 mins to this part. Also a different and killer soundtrack could have done wonders for the movie. But at the end of it not a bad installment in the Marvel franchise.7/10",Venom
97,lewiskendell,A poor adaptation of a great character.,6,22 January 2019,"Venom is not a good movie, but I find myself giving it a (reasonably) good score. Certainly better than the sum of its parts deserves.Largely, I think it's because I've always loved be character. And seeing a movie based on Venom is a cool thing by default, even when so much of the opportunity is wasted. The best part of this whole mess by far is the character of Venom, itself. It looks like Venom should look, and fights how Venom should fight. The few action scenes pretty much saved the movie for me, and without those, this movie scores much worse.As for the bad, well there's a lot to choose from. The tone of the movie does not fit, and is not really consistent from one moment to another. Venom is a violent, brutal character, and does not mesh well with the lame jokes and all-around goofiness that the movie frequently delves into. This carries over into Tom Hardy's portrayal of Eddie Brock. It's just off, wrong, and far too silly. Michelle Williams is utterly wasted in a character that's barely memorable (other than the brief forest scene that's admittedly awesome), the villain is boring and cliche, and the first half of the movie (before the Venom character appears) is a dull slog.Finally, the lack of Spider-Man as a part of Venom's introduction/origin is a shame. The two characters are so tightly linked that Spidey's absence is sorely missing.Still, it's Venom. As terrible as the first half or so of the movie was, I was pretty dang invested once the symbiote started doing its thing. I can't really recommend this move to anyone, even fellow fans of the character. It (barely) worked for me, but I'm under no illusions that this movie is up to standard with the really good superhero movies we've been spoiled by the last several years. I really hope the sequel is better. If the after-credits scene is any indication... it won't be.",Venom

99,vengeance20,Solid & Epic!,8,7 October 2018,"It's a rarity to see a 15+ DC Comics Films like this, so far we've had Logan back in March last year & so with that comes this film! Most DC Comic Films are usually too long, overloaded with CGI, confusing story-line, too much Sci-Fi, pointless scenes & dialogue (with a trace of the old Political Correctness laced within) & the final & most important, the hold back of the true portrayal of these characters/heros/villains etc.This is the second film in the universe to do this (from what I've seen anyway). And in one word, it's epic! They should really continue this style of films as the 12+ ones seem to hold back too much on the portrayal but overload on the other things I just mentioned above. This film is more horror driven.The story follows Eddie Brock, a news reporter for a TV Show he hosts about various crimes across San Francisco. He gets fired & is on the edge. But after discovering whats going on, Eddie goes to the facility & then comes into contact with venom!I found the film to be pretty epic! The visuals were intense & the horror was there! Though the film could've been bloodier & more violent, the film wasn't disappointing at all!I also liked the humour in the film too! It wasn't stupid, or dumb. It was just right! It was also quite dark in a lot of areas which was a bonus!The films run time was decent for a DC Film, at 95 Minutes it was pretty lean! And how films should be!The critical reception of this film was negative. Critics being paid yet again to slam another film for the most put on of reasons! This film was epic!

Though I do wish Venom had a bit more screen time instead of him becoming venom in the second half of the movie.The visuals and the designs for the symbiotes were pretty cool, it definitely opens doors to a sequel.",Venom
101,Gislef,"Slow Start, Picks Up",7,5 March 2021,"The first half, before Venom shows up, is a slog. Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock gets put through a lot of downward paces. Losing his job and his girlfriend? Okay.Once Venom shows up and the heat-biting starts going, the movie picks up. Mainly because Hardy has more to do. And also because of writer Pinkner, Rosenberg, et al. Congratulations that they managed to turn a relatively unlikeblae/villainous 90s character into an anti-hero of sorts.Granted, there are still a few places where the plot falls down. Venom keeps saying that it's a loser. Why? It's more of an informed attribute: we the audience are never told _why_ Venom is a loser. What does that even mean, among a planet of millions of symbiotes? Do they have journalism and employment, and did Venom lose its job? If it was such a ""loser"", why was it on a seemingly-important mission.Ditto for why Venom likes Eddie so much. Eddie is a very unlikeable character: Annie is right about him. He's a self-centered jerk who doesn't think of others, and you wonder why he became an investigative journalist, is buddies with Mrs. Chen and Maria, but dumps on Anne, but the writers are too busy moving onto the next CGI extravaganza to tell us.The final battle between Venom and Riot dissolves into a CGI struggle half of the time. And I like how Venom survives a rocket flame blast... just because.But Hardy-as-Venom's Voice is pretty good. Michelle Williams as Anne (or ""Annie"") becomes a bit more appealing once she gets involved with the plot instead of being another garbage-dumper on Eddie.Overall, I'd fast-forward through the first half of the movie (unless you want to have a vague idea of the story), to the back half of the movie to get the humorous Venom dialogue and the flashy battles.But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. What do you think?",Venom
102,elliotjeory,Venom,9,16 October 2018,Good film. Better than you think. Trailer didn't do it justice. Has a good origins story and will only get better in sequels.,Venom
103,quincytheodore,Tom Hardy is barely keeping Venom alive,6,3 October 2018,"Spider-Man has been a personal favorite super hero of mine. Despite the debacle with different studios and without having Spider-Man, I personally rooted Venom to succeed. However, the jarring tonal shift, occasional clumsy dialogues and heavy reliance on CGI are eerie reminisces of less sophisticated super hero movie from early 2000. It's disappointing because there are some good set pieces here and Tom Hardy tries his damn hardest.On a quick glance Venom can be an action thriller, the tone fits perfectly almost in Daredevil crime drama fashion. It almost reaches such darker place but doesn't dare to take the final step, instead it instantly switches to humor. While this new more cynical Venom is not entirely bad, he is such a good character to establish a more intense atmosphere. It does hurt the nuance, toning down on the menacing aura.Whatever element works on Venom can be credited to Tom Hardy. He displays the reluctant anti-hero so dysfunctionally well. His gesture, slight twitch and banter with the alien invader are a blast. Pacing and script can be problematic, but Tom Hardy just goes all in with sheer tenacity. When it goes to Venom, CGI is inevitable. It's rather unconvincing at times and a more physical choreography would do more wonder than the black suit. I want to see this as standalone movie, but in the end Venom does need Spider-Man. He could've been a stronger faster version of Spidey and with Tom Hardy as anti hero, that would've made such an interesting clash. Also, if it wants to go for sci-fi thriller route, there's already a recent movie with same premise, Upgrade, which sadly did everything better.It's not devoid of entertainment, sometimes the humor hits sweet spot, but if you're here for the sentiment of the Venom namesake, this is not the Homecoming you want. It might not be even the Andrew Garfield kind.",Venom
104,mike48128,Violent and Gory-I Didn't like it very much,8,18 April 2019,"Like ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" Venoms are everywhere, even inside cute puppy dogs and adorable blond-haired little girls. Apparently, human brains are delicious. Also, there is one ""nice"" Venom symbiotic and hundreds of nastier ones, and everyone wants to invade Earth for dinner! Noisy and very busy CGI with Venom v. Venom for what seems like hours but is only about 20 minutes. An impossible motorcycle chase with Venom driving is quite good but also too long. It borders on being a sick, monstrous horror movie or an anti-superhero ""fun-fest"" with one or 2 sexy female ""She-Venoms"" as well. Like the good vampire that only drinks refrigerated blood, one of the Venoms tries to only eat the brains of really bad people and clean up The Hood. Exhausting to watch and therefore I didn't really enjoy it that much. It made a ton of money, so expect Venom 2 in 2020. (Not for me.)

108,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"""Like a turd, in the wind.""",5,22 October 2018,"Venom's a beautifully bad movie that's all-out in its over-the-top nature and its overly oddball Tom Hardy. This movie exists purely as an overdue tie-in to 2007's Spider-Man 3: and boy does this ever show in the film's mid-2000s-inspired Hollywood aesthetics. It's got the hallmarks of a non-MARVEL Studios MARVEL film: stingy references related to the ONE central character in the movie due to rights issues and building up to sequels before even telling the story at hand.This film is an eccentrically empty action-adventure that's trying to tie-in with the modern superhero film craze taking the world by storm. Unfortunately, Venom isn't a very strong example of the genre's strengths: it's a movie made because 'it-had-to-be-done' for Sony (mind you it's not nearly as ATROCIOUS Fox's/Constantin Films' Fant4stic!). Venom's cynical but dumb fun, average story filled with 'ballsy' action sequences guaranteed to make fans of the character proud, but there's not a hell of a lot else to discover in this film.Venom gets 2.5/5 turds in the wind.",Venom

111,Prashast_Singh,Venom is electrifying!,10,5 October 2018,"I knew it. The film was not even half as bad as the critics said. VENOM is the electrifying action movie you need to see in theaters. I saw it today in 4DX 3D and found it highly entertaining. There are a lot of white knuckle action scenes enhanced further by a solid CGI work. An exhilarating vehicular chase sequence had me excited to the core and so did all the other action sequences. Tom Hardy's performance is impressive. His interactions with Venom are heart winning. VENOM is ultimately fast paced. I didn't realize when time flew by. This film has made me like Venom a lot. I liked him in SPIDER-MAN 3 also (which was a great movie in my opinion) but he wasn't portrayed as a hero in that one. In this one, Venom will definitely not be hated. There is also a good amount of comedy and horror present in the film although primarily this is an action movie with a science fiction setting.VENOM definitely reminded me of the dark atmosphere built by Sam Raimi in his Spider-Man movies. That's another reason why I wanted to watch it. It's a highly entertaining action entertainer which needs to be seen and enjoyed as a whole. Since this is anyways an origin story, don't expect it to be overstuffed. Just book your tickets, grab some eatables, bring along a friend or be alone, and watch this film on the biggest screen possible, in 3D. Plus, there are some interesting surprises towards the end, so feel free to stay instead of just walking away. P.S. - I have not read any Venom comics till date.",Venom

113,saptesh786,Average!,5,8 October 2018,"After watching 'Venom' I feel like making someone me fool. It is very average movie. No thrill, no suspense, no story and not even entertaining as expectations raised by trailer and publicity. Only watchable to kids, adults will have a lot of time for popcorn and sleep. Moreover there is no burden on mind. I think is it a creation for another super hero to enter in 'Infinity War'. Looking similar to Deadpool and plot inspired by ' Upgrade'! But as me it is only like time and money waste if you expect best Hollywood thriller.",Venom

115,one9eighty,Glad I ignored the reviews,7,12 February 2020,"Tom Hardy plays the embodiment of comic book character Venom, a bad-guy come anti-hero from the Marvel Universe, usually found from in Spiderman comics. Albeit with some changes and creative re-writes, this is an origin story of how Eddie Brock takes on the symbiotic alien referred to as Venom, which gives him superhuman powers. Dark themes and adult content make this stand out from other Marvel films, but it's worth remembering that this was created by Sony as they try to milk the contracts they signed for Marvel characters prior to Marvel studios being a thing.I have mixed feelings about this film. I enjoyed it, but I had to forget everything else I knew about the character while watching it. There was plenty of action and some tongue-in-cheek dark humour. Tom Hardy did a decent job as Brock/ Venom. I was a little let down that the story seemed like other origin stories that have been committed to celluloid previously - particularly with (spoiler) the other symbiotes have to be defeated - kind of like Antman when he has to fight Yellowjacket, or Hulk fighting another Hulk, a super soldier fighting another super soldier, or an Iron Man fighting another Iron Man. The CGI in the film, although quite heavy, was decent enough; it didn't look too cheesy or fake for most of the film. Probably the best praise about this film that I can add to my review, while I had mixed feelings, my missus loved it. Admittedly the film could have been better, but it could have also been a lot worse too. Probably worth ignoring the haters and give this a film a go yourself. 7 out of 10.",Venom
116,educallejero,Too many writers.... too many tones... Venom is awesome and I want more though!,3,7 October 2018,"CGI was AWESOME. Venom was awesome every single second he was on screen.Other than that, the movie is quite terrible. It just doesn't commit to a style and, in my opinion, suffers for it.Starts Sci-fi, then its typical origin comic book, then action-comedy with dark touches, then...The humor, which is mostly dumb, mixed with dark jokes and some visual absurdism doesn't sound bad per se, but the reality is that they just don't nail a good enough amount of the jokes and Hardy's interpretation serves well some kind of jokes (when he is talking to Venom) and literally nothing else in the movie. Eddie Brooks is a just weird character. Human characters: A realistic portrait of a relationship starts with Hardy's Brook character and his girlfriend. But after the first act, its just silly and all over the place. A philosophical villain didn't mantain the tone. At times he was a bigger than life thinker and crazy scientist, and at other times he was a typical sutarday cartoon villain. The action is good, not great. It takes waaaaay too much time for fun things to start to happen. It seems the first act was writen by somebody, then the middle part for another one, and ANOTHER one had to wrap the story and the arcs of the characters (and failed).Honestly. Its a dissapointment.Having said that: I don't think ""I wasted my money"", because its enjoyable and I want more. This one had a low budget and it was a bet. I'll support Sony. I want more.",Venom
117,phubbs,Venom,6,23 March 2019,"Another day, another comicbook movie. When will it end??So after the somewhat dismal iteration of Venom in 'Spider-Man 3' Sony went back to the drawing board. Initially plans seemed to revolve around having Venom get in on the action in the rebooted 'The Amazing Spider-Man' franchise, but that failed. There were ideas to have Venom kickstart his own franchise which would share the same universe as other Marvel characters. There was also an idea to have Venom in 'Spider-Man: Homecoming'. There was also an idea to have a low budget adult version. Whatever rumours or stories we can all agree that for some reason the powers that be really wanted a Venom movie.So eventually we got this movie. Whilst on a deep space mission a corporation led by the evil Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) manages to discover a comet covered in symbiotic lifeforms. Bringing four specimens back to Earth one escapes and causes the shuttle to crash which unleashes it. In the meantime Drake starts to experiment on humans, trying to get the aliens to match with a host. The aliens need an oxygen-breathing host to survive.As you might imagine Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) eventually gets into this corporations HQ (with help from an employee) and is accidentally taken over by one of the symbiotes. We then follow Brock as he adjusts to the alien inside him, Drake and his goons coming after Brock, and eventually the last surviving symbiote taking over Drake resulting in Riot.Now I'm not up on every Marvel character so I don't know how accurate this movie is to the original source material. I'm guessing there have been many changes. But I do have some large queries. The symbiotes are looking for a planet with hosts they can take over and consume, OK. So what exactly is their plan of action for Earth? Eat every human and...? Then what? Is this all they do?At the start of the movie we are led to believe that it's hard to find the correct match for the symbiote. Drake is going through loads of human test subjects trying to find a human that will bond with the symbiote. OK that's fine. But at the same time, the symbiote Riot seems to be jumping from human to human no probs at all. Add to that, later on in the movie the symbiote Venom seems to have no problem taking over Brock's ex-girlfriend and a dog. Riot also takes over Drake no problems too. I dunno if I missed something but this just seems inconsistent because we are led to believe that it's hard to find the perfect match for the symbiotes, and when Venom finds Brock it's treated like a shocking breakthrough.I also found kinda odd that the aliens have names from our human language. I thought (in the comics) Brock came up with the name himself once combined with the symbiote (?). But in this movie the symbiotes seem to already have their names. I also thought Venom changed its mind way too quickly about Earth and humans. The symbiote seems to take the choice of betraying its own very easily purely based on liking Brock. And it had only been combined to Brock for a day or so, maybe not even that! Far too convenient for me.Aside from that the movie is generally incredibly dated in style and outcome. This REALLY feels like a movie that came out in the 90's. It looks like a movie that came out in the 90's. The CGI ranges from really sweet lookin' to really terrible lookin'. Close-ups of Venom are great, most everything else is bad. Most of the action sequences are woefully bad in both execution and visuals. The stunts are clearly stunts. There are tonnes of obvious greenscreen shots. Venom looks rubbery at times and plastic at others. When Venom fights Riot its an indistinguishable CGI mess. And the bad guys are astronomically cliched. This is the present day 'Spawn'.Yet despite all that, for some reason, I kinda liked this. I like that they tried to make this somewhat dark and gritty, and for the most part, they succeeded. The start of the movie is quite eerie, playing up some horror tropes. And Hardy definitely helps with his unhinged, dirty, druggie-esque performance. Personally I think they should have gone for broke with an all out R/18 rated flick because the head biting scenes needed to be seen. As they stand its stupid because there's no blood or gore and I'm pretty sure onlookers would be more horrified (the Asian shopkeeper at the end much?).But yeah, can't quite put my finger on it but I sorta liked this. Kinda reminded me of the trashy mid 90's flicks I'd see at my local Odeon on a Wednesday afternoon. Its not a good movie, its legitimately bad with poor...everything truth be told. Still, in an odd way, this is just...dumb fun.6/10",Venom
118,rockman182,Venom (2018),6,8 October 2018,"When we were talking about a stand alone Venom film, the possibilities seemed endless. It looks like Sony is deciding to launch their own Marvel Universe that is separate from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which I don't have much of a problem with. On top of that, getting Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock? This should have been something very memorable and fun. Unfortunately, what we get is an average superhero film that is uneven and doesn't grab your interest. Its not a good start to this new set of films that are being planned, if that's the case.The film is about a journalist who loses his job after he tried to report a scandal against a large corporation and the malpractice involved. His life falls apart and his girlfriend also leaves him. He soon finds himself going back to the corporation and gets infected by a symbiote that becomes a part of him. The symbiote causes voices in his head, a black shapeshifting substance that covers his body and gives him super human powers and a voracious appetite. The film also stars Riz Ahmed, Michelle Williams, and Jenny Slate. As with other Marvel films stay after the credits for a scene.Where do I start? The film has a few boring passages. The Venom character looks good in some scenes but then looks choppy in others. Tom Hardy does his best with what he could in a film that mixes darkness and humor awkwardly. The villain is weak and the film falls into the typical pitfalls of these types of comic book films. There are moments that are definitely fun. The quality of it is low compared to the incredible MCU films and this film comes in with a whimper while Iron Man made waves as the first in the MCU. It's unfair to compare sure, but the film needed a backbone of real originality to do the character justiceThe film has moments of intensity, which keeps it engaging but momentarily. Maybe Venom needs Spidey to really keep it interesting, I don't know. I mean I actually don't know if this film is any better than any of the MCU films, which is kind of insane. Overall, I wanted to really like this as it has a good cast and an important and popular character in the Marvel universe. It could have been so much better.6/10",Venom

120,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A standard hero film that happens to feature a former villain.,6,8 March 2019,"If I haven't said it before in my review of Spider-man: Homecoming (2017), I'll repeat it here: I grew up watching the 1990s animated Spider-man series, which makes the Spider-man franchise one of my favorite. Consequently, most of my knowledge of the franchise comes from the show. In my mind, the symbiote storyline that introduced Venom was one of the best in the series, and I was disappointed when Spider-man 3 (2007) woefully miscast Eddie Brock with Topher Grace. Flash forward a decade later, and the big screen is taking another crack at the Venom storyline in a standalone film...but without Spider-man.As a long-time fan, I appreciated the mostly faithful origin story in Venom (2018), with a few minor and vital details still retained to make it close to what actually happened. This time around, Tom Hardy was a much better choice for the titular role, even if his mumbling accent was a little distracting at times. While the physique was a match, the character did still feel a little off, mostly because his primary motivation (i.e., revenge on Spider-man) was no longer there. Venom is a pretty brutal villain in the Marvel universe, but for some reason, we can't have the main character of a superhero film be as sinister as they should be. I blame the misunderstood Thanos from Avengers: Infinity War (2018).So, despite taking a villain and turning them into a hero, Venom still felt pretty solid, especially with the setup for an exciting sequel. Sure, some of the action was too shaky or dark to understand what was going on, but it was still well-paced. In the end, it was some pretty standard origin story superhero fare, so if you like that, you'll be satisfied. However, I felt the after/end credits scene completely undid any of the great things this film did by teasing a potentially much better movie that hadn't come out yet.A standard hero film that happens to feature a former villain, I give Venom 3.0 stars out of 5.",Venom
121,RforFilm,Venom lives up to the title; it's cinematic poison that's part standard superhero and part bad editing that damages the movie's darker intent,4,5 October 2018,"Yep, we've got another Spider-Man story...sort of. In fact, instead of Spider-Man, today's movie focuses on one of his most famous villains, Venom. He consistently remains a popular character within the Marvel comics thanks to his persona (about a monster of a human who has an even bigger monster inside) and design that is frightening and cool looking. I attest Venom as a character similar to a horror villain like Freddy Kruger; someone who you know is not good but seems to have fun doing what they do. He also serves as a polar opposite of Spider-Man, having similar powers, but is darker and more powerful. The idea of making him an antihero is not a bad one. I can see how they could take a very flawed person and make him sympathetic for his cause, like Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry or Johnny Lawrence in Cobra Kai. It would have to take a skilled writer and a director who could understand the duality between the man Eddie Brock and the alien symbiote, Venom. It would also have to figure out the purpose of this alien and how it's ideology changes after being on Earth. Sadly, Venom does none of that and goes for something more standard. In San Francisco, investigative reporter Eddie Brock (played by Tom Hardy) is doing a story on the Life Foundation. The Life Foundation's president Carlton Drake (played by Riz Ahmed) is questioned about his companies' space exploration and the experiments it's performing on people. Carlton has Eddie escorted off the property, and without evidence to back up his claims, Eddie is fired from his job and loses his district attorney girlfriend Anne Weying (played by Michelle Williams). Of course, Carlton is working on symbiotes his team had acquired from space and is trying to find suitable hosts.Sometime later, Eddie has become a disgraced writer who can't get work. This seems to change when he's approached by Dr. Dora Skirth (played by Jenny Slate), a scientist at the Life Foundation who wants the companies evildoings exposed. While sneaking around with her, Eddie is exposed to one of the symbiotes who. He escapes but he starts to hear a dark voice talking to him and finds himself consistently eating. The symbiote reveals itself as ""Venom"" (Played by Eddie Brock) whose come to Earth to eat humans, but understands that it has to work with Eddie to survive and stop other symbiotes from coming.Venom has a lot that could have made it a unique, more of a horror-comedy based story. Instead, this goes for of the standard superhero origin story and some odd editing, but we'll get to that in a moment. I'll say that Tom Hardy may be the perfect actor to portray Venom/Eddie Brock. He's taken tough material before and could have played both parts just fine. But we neither get enough time to know enough about Eddie Brock (who always comes off like a nice guy trying to play arrogant and bullish) or Venom (who mostly says,""Rawr, let's eat his heart and brain! Rawr, so many snacks!""). The rest of the characters and story more or less are given a pass. Michelle Williams is the typical nice girlfriend, Riz Ahmed is the typical corporate villain, and Jenny Slate is the typical nerdy scientist with a heart of gold. Their not bad, but we also don't get enough time to know them as characters. It all feels like much of that was neglected in favor of moving the story forward. Once Venom does come in the picture, we do get some interesting sequences (Eddie Brock going crazy, a car chase, and a S.W.A.T. team fight). The effects do take advantage of the situation that Venom is more of a ""blob"" type alien and tries to be creative with it. There's just not character to make me care for it.Let's talk about the editing. I read that Venom was meant to be an R rated movie, but was cut down to ensure a mainstream audience. It's painfully obvious, as Venom is always talking about eating people and has the sharp teeth to enact some gory scenes. Instead of a genuinely scary character, the PG-13 now makes a lot of that more like the speech of a thirteen year-old trying to be scary. Plus, there are moments where Eddie Brock and Venom seem to have different goals, but then seem like good friends without a transition or indication. There's even a scene where a character goes into a building at night, and suddenly it's day. I'll give this four Venoms out of ten. I get the feeling that while this movie sucks, an R rated cut that might have more character driven scenes that might have made this work. But as it is, this Venom lives up to the title; it feels like cinematic poison that will bore audiences then excite them. This is a superhero story that really needs the antidote.",Venom

Still, we definitely miss that connection to Spider-Man because, Venom & Spider-Man are always connected in the comics. The action set pieces are fantastic. The critics can't whine about CGI fight scenes because, what more can you expect from a CGI character. Still, I wish they would have shown us some of the more nasty things that Venom did in the movie. An R rating would have helped but, I can understand why they decided to make the movie PG-13. They needed to make way for Spider-Man in possible sequels(fingers crossed). Tom Hardy is the star of the show as Eddie Brock/Venom. Hardy perfects the relationship between Eddie & Venom. Eddie being the vulnerable host & Venom being the caged animal that can be let loose at any time. There are a number of hysterical set pieces involving interactions between Eddie & Venom. Tom Hardy also perfects Venom's classic deep & gruff voice. Michelle Williams is brilliant as Anne Weying. It's nice to see Williams star in a comic book movie.

124,bankofmarquis,Performances by Hardy and Williams elevate a mediocre script,7,11 October 2018,"I had lowered my expectations when entering the new Sony film VENOM for I had heard that this non-MCU Marvel film wasn't really a Marvel - or a Spiderman - film, even though it features one of the more famous characters from the Spiderman Universe, which is, of course, a Marvel property.Confused, yet?Well, don't be. Because this knowledge is not needed, nor (quite frankly) is it wanted as the filmmakers of Venom made a film that centers on the titular anti-hero with no real regard to his place in the Marvel Universe.And this works well...enough. True, the plot, dialogue, situations, special effects and gadgets of this film are middle-of-the-road at best, but with the two folks at the center of this film, I started to forgive this film it's many flaws and enjoyed two Oscar-caliber Actors having a good ol' time in a Supehero movie.Venom, of course, tells the story of...Eddie Brock..who becomes - through a merging of his body with an Alien symbiotic creature (don't worry about it, just roll with it) - becomes the titular VENOM. A being that wants to eat live creatures (most notably human heads) while the good part of Eddie tries to keep him in check and help him fight bad guys.In lesser performance hands, this character could become silly and stupid, but in the more than capable performance by the great Tom Hardy (Bane in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES), Eddie Brock/Venom is an intriguing figure to watch on-screen. His simultaneous ability to look unnerved and hunger for live flesh while looking for a nice cool bath caused me to smirk on more than one occasion and I ended up rooting for him throughout the film.Matching him is the great Michelle Williams (she of the 4 Oscar nominations, most recently in MANCHESTER BY THE SEA) as Eddie Brock's ex-Fiance Anne Weying. Like Hardy, Williams is elevating mediocre material to something better than the mediocrity it was destined to be. The chemistry between Williams and Hardy is evident in their bi-play with each other and I couldn't help but think ""get these two into an Oscar-caliber film together and watch the sparks - and the awards - fly.""Unfortunately, Riz Ahmed as bad guy Carlton Drake is not able to rise above the material and when he is playing opposite Hardy and/or Williams, he pales in comparison and I began to realize just how weak the script by the trio of Jeff Pinkner, Scott Rosenberg and Kelly Marcel is. Clearly, two of them were brought in to re-write the original (I have no idea who did what) but none of them were able to elevate the proceedings.Nor could Director Ruben Fleischer (ZOMBIELAND) elevate things. His Direction is pedestrian at best. There is nothing really interesting going on and when the going got tough he just started to rely on the quick cut/edits that is so ""en vogue"" these days - and it grew tiresome.But when I started to grow weary of the events on the screen, Hardy and Williams would show up and I began to forgive things again, even thinking during the credits scene (where they introduce the Villain for VENOM 2), I want to see Hardy and Williams play against (name deleted so as not to spoil) as the new Villain - that might be cool!So, I'm ""in"" for Venom. It was ""good enough"" and I will come back for the next installment - and based on the Box Office of the opening weekend, there WILL BE a next installment.Letter Grade: B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Venom

This has nothing to do with its source material aside from the character of Venom itself and its host body Eddie Brock.And it doesn't know wether it wants to be a horror movie, drama, action or whatever. This comes forth when Eddie is possesed by the symbiote which starts to control him and he starts doing out of place goofy antics when both the background music clearly suggests that we be afraid.But the worst part was when he started having this cringy dialogue with the symbiote like some kind of coach or something.Doesn't do anything clever with itself, and I regret buying tickets for it.

With his new powers but also new ""friend"" inside him, Eddie will have to do his best to change his egocentric behaviour which brought him into this mess and do what is best for him and for humanity alike.It's a quite impressive movie which presents investigation reporter Eddie Brock, his personality and his new form after his gets infected. We follow his evolution as he slowly figures out what went so wrong with his life and begins to try and repair what is left. Venom's character and look also play a very important role in the story, as he is responsible for plenty of action, laughter but also emotion.The plot presented is quite good. It brings a good idea (that of symbiotes) and builds up a good intrigue based on it. The characters portrayed are complex, likeable and well played by their actors, making the experience worthwhile. It brings action, drama, emotion and suspense through impressive visual effects, so another plus from this side. It also manages to not be predictable, although the main story tents to be quite linear, without anything out of the ordinary in terms or twists.There isn't much not to like if you ask me. As long as you go with the story and accept its fantastic premise, you're about to have a very good time. You may find some aspects quite exaggerated or a bit illogical but as far as I'm concerned, they fit into the fantastic setting that the movie proposes.Overall, I saw a very good movie in every aspect, with a good plot, good actors, plenty of action and special effects and also with a good dose of unpredictability. It gets a clear recommendation from my side.",Venom

Previously seen in Spiderman, Venom now has his (or should I say its) own film and franchise, yes franchise because you can guarantee there will be other Venom films but will it be a franchise any good or a franchise too far? As usual I will try not to give any spoilers away but this will be very difficult to do, so get ready, hold onto your seats because............Lazy writing, the only way I can describe it is to use another recent film which suffered from the same thing and it spoiled the film, yes it's Batman vs Superman.In that film you had the 2 heroes who for some unknown reason didn't get on. Now we all know that Superman could have crushed Batman and not even broken out in a sweat, not to mention the reason why they both suddenly become friends, because their mom's had the same first name! Venom suffers from this same lazy writing, why Venom decides too stay and fight.......... Oh come on, credit us audiences with some intelligence please! In essence the film is good, not great, special effects are excellent as usual and Tom Hardy is brilliant as the bumbling confused anti hero but the big fight is way too short, the story seems to drag out the film which would have been better at 90 mins not 120, so just too long.

Between the lines; the movie leaves a space open for your choice of dark, darker or darkest. VENOM itself eats people alive and on top of that is pretty much killing the host (an outstanding Tom Hardy) so it is not really a very nice guy.The action scenes are original, tense and entertaining; something MARVEL / DISNEY could care less as seen in their last movies. There are lots of humor; sometimes towards to adults and language is strong (even a couple of F** out there).The only two minor problems; it takes perhaps a few minutes to more than necessary to turn on full motion and the script could have been a little more.In brief; pure satisfying and guilty entertainment",Venom

Brock targets for his latest investigation Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed): a billionaire space pioneer (I hope the producers got WELL lawyered up!) Drake is a Bond-style megalomaniac who is intend on saving mankind by merging humans with aliens to create a symbiotic organism. Not wishing to go through all the nampy-pamby clinical trials stuff, he is doing live research on vagrants and others who ""won't be missed""... with generally negative results. Infected accidently with the symbiont called Venom Brock's future hangs in the balance: the meld will either kill him or else a new superhero will be born.For anyone with one foot already in the Spiderverse, Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom have appeared before, in the convoluted and pretty poor Tobey Maguire sequel ""Spider-Man 3"". In that film Eddie (played by Topher Grace) was the boyfriend of Gwen Stacey (then played by Bryce Dallas-Howard) who was similarly infected by an alien symbiote and was transformed into Venom.This new Venom incarnation is a Sony Pictures production ""with"" Marvel Studios, and although featuring a Stan Lee cameo it never quite feels like a Marvel picture. Posher critics have described it as ""tonally inconsistent"".... which is posh-critic language for ""it's all over the place""! And they are right. It veers suddenly from high drama and sci-fi action to plodding dialogue and Deadpool-style wisecracks with clutch-smoking rapidity. As such, the film never feels like it's decided whether it wants to be at the po-faced Captain America end of the Marvel specturn or at the wise-cracking Deadpool/GotG end.Tom Hardy actually gets to spend a lot of this film without a mask over his face, which is certainly a novelty! And he gives it his all acting wise which will please his army of fans. But his pairing with the Oscar-winning Michelle Williams never feels comfortable: there seems little chemistry between the pair given that they are an ""item"". None of this is helped by the grindingly turgid script which gives the pair, plus Reid Scott (""Dan"" from ""Veep"") as the third corner in the love triangle, some truly dire dialogue to spout at each other.An act I did like in the film was Riz Ahmed as the ""really bad guy"" Drake. I found Ahmed extremely annoying in ""Rogue One"", but here he slides into the smarmy evil role perfectly. A better script, like a future Bond film, would have benefitted from the turn!Woody Harrelson also turns up in a mid-credit ""monkey"" a ""well-known"" supervillain: which meant nothing to me but certainly does to comic-book fans.A technical shout-out should go to Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson (who's previously done ""Black Panther"" and ""Creed""): an unusual soundtrack with odd electronica, eerie electric-guitar riffs for Eddie's theme interspersed with exciting fast-paced action beats.This is not a classic Marvel flick, but for me it wasn't nearly as bad as some of the critical reviews have made it out to be. I saw this alone: and we were quite entertained.",Venom

135,kjproulx,"A Fun, Tonal Mess",5,5 October 2018,"I'm going to try my best in not using the word ""fun"" to describe my feelings toward this movie because that word is to be taken with a large grain of salt here. Due to the way I personally experienced this film, I would love to sugarcoat it and talk about the positives and mention why all of the negatives are really positives, but that would just be ignoring the film as a whole. Venom is the latest attempt at starting a Marvel franchise outside of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and if this movie is any indication of what their plans are, then I'm afraid for this world to expand. That being said, at times, this movie is a blast to watch and I had a decent time at the theatre. I'm by no means calling this a good film, but here's why some viewers will probably find some enjoyment.Taking next to nothing from the source material, Venom follows Eddie Brock as he stumbles upon an alien life form known as a Symbiote. The company known as the Life Foundation has been running tests on these Symbiotes in hopes of merging them with a human. Once Eddie merges with the Symbiote known as Venom, chaos ensues and he begins to wreak havoc on the city, or face certain death if he doesn't cooperate. The fact that his life is in danger is literally the only glimpse at the true origin of this character. Quite honestly, the fact that they weren't able to use Spider-Man really took away from the depth that this film could've achieved. That aside, I chose to watch the movie as if it was an original film, with no comic origins to weigh it down.As a movie with absolutely no baggage, it creates some of its own by having a first act that relies far too heavily on the serious aspects of this foundation and not enough humour with the character of Eddie Brock. By the time Eddie becomes one with Venom, his sequences are very funny and easily staple themselves as the highlights of the film. From the dialogue to the set-up, this character was far better than the film that surrounded him. I found myself loving every whimsical second of the presence that either Eddie Brock or Venom provided. Their interaction with one another made me wish I had been watching a better movie with them in it.As far as the action goes, the second half of the film is loaded with it. When this film begins, it drags on quite a bit with a very mediocre premise, while also rushing through many story beats, making it quite the jumbled mess. If you're willing to be patient with a film in order to get to some awesome and even comedic sequences, then I would recommend Venom to you, based purely on entertainment. This is a film that would have benefitted from a teenage audience over a decade ago. The standard that has been set by many comic-based hero films these days are just too high for a film like this to match.In the end, Venom is a film that has a very strong, entertaining, and even hilarious central anti-hero. Its biggest flaw is the fact that every character is very standard and one-dimensional, and given that this film has a supporting cast in Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed, that's quite upsetting. It has a decent score and the action is entertaining at times, but the story itself falls flat on its face. This movie would've benefitted from the true origin of its titular character, but the presence of that character is pretty awesome on-screen. Although the movie is very hollow, I would almost recommend this film for Tom Hardy's performance as Eddie Brock, because it was fantastic. Overall, Venom isn't a good film, but there are some terrifically entertaining moments.",Venom

The story line is literally more yawn-able than the plot for Halle Berry's ""Catwoman"" back in 2004. Fourth; also like ""Catwoman,"" there is only the thinnest of connections to the original superhero comic that gave birth to this anti-hero (i.e. an ill-fated astronaut named Jameson).

So many snacks, so little time!",7,8 October 2018,"I guess the major feeling I get watching an MCU (Marvel Comics Universe) movie is, wow once the special effects industry was an auxiliary of the movie industry, now the movie industry is an auxiliary of the special effects industry. But I guess everyone's down with that these days? So I won't preach too hard about it, after all Méliès and his effects kicked it all off and so maybe we're back to the beginning of film, with all it's awkwardness and inappropriateness too.The movie was appealing to me from the poster and the trailer. A normal guy can become Venom, Venom don't take none of the brown stuff, he's gonna kick you ass right out of your face. So yeah a two hour holiday from the tediousness of the social contract.The film actually comes off as a bit of a buddy movie, inseparable parasite and host journalist Eddie Brock spends most of the movie bonding with comic effect. A main failure is that we're meant to believe that macho figurehead and multi-millionaire heartthrob Tom Hardy is playing a ""loser"". As usual with comic book stuff, you end up feeling that the resulting vigilantism is being given a bit more support than it probably should be getting (the effects of vigilantism are usually heartbreakingly stupid and tragic). The villain (I imagine Elon Musk probably didn't see the funny side with this one) and the antihero both basically have the same general activity, they do whatever the hell they want. But you have to get in bed with the devil to defeat the evil people, right? What popularised the ""work with your darkness"" nonsense, Dexter back in 2006?

147,Min111,I liked how Venom looked,7,5 August 2020,"I like these spin-off movies. I hope there's more for other Spiderman villains such as Carnage, Dr Octopus, Green Goblin, Kingpin, Lizard, Rhino, Scorpion, Shocker and Vulture. There are other villains as well besides them. I know Carnage will appear in a sequel, so that's good to see. Carnage has a more interesting back-story than Venom would you believe. I can't wait to see that. I highly doubt there will be for many of these Spiderman enemies. I thought Venom was a good movie. What I liked the 'most' about Venom was the way it looked. It looked so wicked and cool. I like the design. It looks exactly the same as the Venom you see in the animated series except better. Venom looks scary and menacing. That's how it should be. Venom is evil. Venom is one of the most interesting characters or villains in Spiderman. I'm happy a Venom movie was made. The producers did a good job. I don't understand why so many people hate it. What did you expect? It's a Venom movie; not a Spiderman movie. We've already seen enough of Spiderman or Peter Parker in Spiderman, Spiderman 2, Spiderman 3, and the other Spiderman movies. So, it was nice to see something different for a change, and one of them was Venom. I find it so hard to believe though that there wasn't a small glimpse of Spiderman in Venom. This movie has nothing to do with Spiderman at all. Somehow, it all worked. It was 'strange' having to sit through a movie without Spiderman being in it. You get use to it though. That was a good thing from the producers. Stick to the principles. I can't believe how awesome and terrifying, the creature, Venom, looked. I give it a ten out of ten just the way it looks. Venom looked very bad, and that's in a nice way of putting it. Let's not forget the character Venom took control - Eddie Brock. He's a journalist by the way. He becomes the host of an alien symbiote, Venom, where he gains superpowers. His powers are extraordinary! One of the 'strongest' Spiderman villains there is. The two share a body, and they happen to work together. Venom happens to be one of Spiderman's greatest enemies by the way. Possibly, in the top three after the Green Goblin and Dr Octopus. So, I'm not at all surprised why a Venom movie was made. I also liked the way Venom sounded. He sounded like a true monster. He obviously looked like a monster - that's what Venom is all about. Venom likes to cause fear. I know about the Venom in Spiderman 3, but this Venom is better. I liked both. I can't wait to see the sequel where you get to see the character, Cletus Kasady, as Carnage. He's even more dangerous than Venom can you believe. It will be nice to see Carnage and Venom going against each other. I still feel Venom is the strongest of the two characters. Carnage is definitely the more evil. The person Carnage takes control, Cletus Kasady, is a psychopath. I liked Venom. He's one of my favourite enemies. I have give it a good rating. I think it's worth at least seven stars or more. I also like that the movie runs 'under' two hours. It's not too long, and is something you can enjoy watching quickly. Venom is a must see!",Venom

150,MrDHWong,A strange anomaly of a film that feels like it is from another generation altogether,5,4 October 2018,"Venom is a superhero film based on the Marvel Spider-Man villain of the same name. Starring Tom Hardy in the title role, it is a strange anomaly of a film that feels like it is from another generation altogether.In San Francisco, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), a former investigative journalist, comes into contact with an alien symbiote that transforms him into a monstrous beast and gives him superhuman abilities. The beast calls itself ""Venom"" and tells Eddie that in order to survive on Earth, it needs to use him as its host. After discovering he is being pursued by a dangerous corporation, Eddie decides to ally with Venom to fend off the attackers.Tonally inept and quite bizarre, Venom revels in its campiness and its weird entertainment factor. Every terrible moment is often cancelled out by something so ridiculously fun that it is difficult not to be entertained by it, and in turn, for every great moment there is usually something stupid to undo it, effectively bringing some kind of warped balance to the entire viewing experience. Tom Hardy's performance in the lead role garners somewhat mixed reactions. As Eddie he plays it seriously but the moment he becomes Venom, he hams it up to absurd levels, especially with the voice he uses once he has transformed. The film does, however, nail Venom's personality traits and super abilities, in addition to showcasing some cheesy CGI effects on his character model. Overall, Venom could be seen from two different perspectives, the first being that it is a somewhat satirical take on some of the ridiculous superhero films of the mid 2000s (think Spider-Man 3, Fantastic Four, Daredevil), and the second being that it is yet another modern comic-based misfire from Sony Pictures, further proving that they should just give back the character rights to Marvel.

152,Alexander_Blanchett,Fine entertainment but a wasted opportunity nevertheless,7,4 October 2018,"I really looked forward to another (anti) superhero movie in the tradition of ""Deadpool"". While the film was not bad at all, it does not reach the cult league of the formerly mentioned.
The film had many good aspects. The most one to focus on is surely the casting coup of Tom Hardy who was a blessing for the film. He nailed the role perfectly and was able to add a lot of self irony to the film without forgetting to take his character serious (as much as it gets). 
The other great moments was when actual Venom was on screen, especially in the first half. And there is also the first problem. The film deserved to have more on-screen Venom and in the second half of the film the character lost a bit of its appeal and somehow his origins. They could have made more out of it and that role and generally had potential to make the film much darker but I guess they aspired the PG 13 rating too hard. 
Besides Tom Hardy we have the Reuben Fleischer had the great opportunity to have the wonderful Michelle Williams on board. However with that screenplay and her role it was impossible to use her full potential so she was more or less wasted. Kudos to Williams that she really tried to make the best out of it. Riz Ahmed was an interesting choice for the villain and it worked. The ending was a bit anti climatic. There were a couple of entertaining action sequences and exciting editing. The soundtrack worked and there is a great came of Woody Harrelson that really makes me hungry for a Carnage movie with him the title role. However, I dont think the world will need a ""Venom"" sequel. Nice try, not a failure but wasted opportunity.",Venom

155,CANpatbuck3664,A Flawed Movie That Was A lot of Fun to Watch,7,7 October 2018,"In most big budget action movies, the first complaint you hear is CGI overload. This is one of the rare occasions where I can say the CGI being so impressive was one of the best parts of Venom. Venom looks awesome as a creature, the way they chose to animate his look and his movement was impressive. The movie is also shot pretty well, they shoot in a lot of dingy locations before Eddie (Tom Hardy) interacts with Venom to help ground the movie, and I thought the action was handled pretty well. I wish that we had got the R-rated version to really see the potential of what Venom could do as a villain, but I liked the majority of the action scenes regardless.We get to spend a decent portion of the movie with Eddie before we get introduced to Venom and while the overall plot isn't completely fresh, I didn't think it was as bad or as routine as the critics did. They aren't breaking new ground in the genre with Eddie's story from laughing stock to redemptive hero, but it gets the job done. We get some unique banter from Eddie and Venom that had me laughing at different times in the movie. It was also a little hit or miss (which is true for all the dialogue in the script), but I chuckled like everyone else in the theatre did. Did Venom have a few plot holes? Yes, it did but the movie doesn't linger on them and with Tom Hardy's crazy performance, I was able to go along for the ride Venom's cast features actors and actresses that I wouldn't have pictured being interested in this movie. Tom Hardy is a great actor and I think casting him was a good decision. He brings something to this role and he does as much as he possibly can with this material. My only note is that Eddie as a character seems to act like he's a little younger than Hardy, so he may be a little old for the part. But otherwise, he was one of the best parts of the movie. I really like Riz Ahmed too, he's transitioning to bigger and bigger projects and I've yet to see him in anything where he wasn't a standout (check out The Reluctant Fundamentalist and The Night Of). I think he's miscast here; the character calls for him to be a little more sinister and animated yet he's oddly reserved. He had his moments, he gives a speech to a test subject about the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac that was well delivered but they needed another actor. Michelle Williams rarely appears in blockbuster movies, she does her job capably, but she gets the short end of the stick. Her character is a little generic and aside from one scene, there isn't much for her to do here. I will also credit Jenny Slate who did a solid job in her scenes.The most pronounced criticism that the critics have lobbied against this movie that I can agree with is that the scene transitions in Venom are oddly sloppy. When I say that, I'm not referring to character decisions or to tonal swings (both have their off moments going into the final turn, especially with Eddie/Anne romance) I mean the movie just doesn't flow from scene to scene. There could be pieces missing that fill in the blanks (Tom Hardy's comments about the movie seem to indicate as much) but a good movie compares to an orchestral music piece. Despite so many elements being brought together, there's harmony. Venom lacks that consistency, you'll be wondering how characters arrived in certain places or how time is passing in an uneven way. I usually believe its poor editing, but I thought the fight scenes were cut together surprisingly well. I don't know whether to point the finger at the editor, the studio or the director but they could have done a better job, especially with such a big project.I don't want to make excuses for Venom but the last not I'll make was the movie was fun the whole way through. I never got the impression that the movie was taking itself very seriously (the interplay between Eddie and Venom was a little tongue-in-cheek) and that helped me get on board. Despite this not being a landmark for superhero movies, not every movie in the genre needs to be Infinity War and with the different vibe Venom goes for, there's enough here to keep you happy for the whole picture.Despite the negative word of mouth surrounding Venom leading up to the release, I was rooting for this movie. Walking out of the theatre, I thought of another film Ruben Fleischer directed called Gangster Squad. Similar to Venom, that movie had a lot going for it but tripped up in a couple of key areas (the worst being the horribly hammy dialogue). The character design, the CGI, the action and even the central performance are all good to great here, and I liked the fact that we're getting more anti-heroes instead of boy scout superheroes. But Venom also stumbles over corny dialogue, some miscast actors and actresses and a lack of polish that the top end superhero movies have. I would really like to see a sequel to this, maybe they'd be able to iron out more of the kinks on the second try and go for a little more edge. Venom is a mixed bag, but I think the good outweighs the bad easily and the critics were too harsh on this. I'd give Venom a 7.5/10 but I can't quite go to 8 on it so I must round down. If you're interested, go check it out but if you're not sold, waiting for it to be on your preferred streaming service isn't a bad idea.",Venom
156,apryla-58795,Not Tom Hardy's Best,5,29 December 2018,"This wasn't as terrible as I had been hearing it was...still Tom Hardy was clearly out of his element. He is not comfortable looking people straight in the eye or holding still. It was weird to see him straining to try to not act like he usually does-obviously he did not always win that battle. He seemed very awkward in this and he mumbles everything. His accent sounded like he was trying to imitate someone from New Jersey but it came and went frequently. Not sure he was the best choice for this role. And I'm sorry but if that guy would just fix his horrible teeth, stop constantly frowning, get a nose job so he doesn't always look like he's wearing a prosthetic even when he's NOT filming, could figure out a flattering hairstyle that isn't going 20 different ways, learned how to enunciate, could learn how to stop walking bow-legged and sideways at the same time, and grew about 5 more inches...he could be insanely hot BUT as it is all those things just hold him back and are quite distracting onscreen.Michelle Williams who is usually good in most things also seemed out of place and out of her element. She seems to excel in serious films or indies and should stick to those. I believe she was miscast in this as well. She had zero chemistry with Tom.I love Riz Ahmed and he played his part perfectly.Jenny Slate wasn't too bad in this although initially I had my doubts.There was no one else of note.Not the best but I did tell my husband at one point, ""The first 30 minutes of this film are better than anything else I've watched all week.""

But, I was wrong. This one had a 50s sci-fi movie appeal and aspects (eg aliens, humor, naivete, SFX) that I could appreciate, like The Blob meets The Thing (from Another Planet).
From my experience, I don't gravitate towards comic book movies. And, after having seen this and the end credit short, I would be interested in a sequel.",Venom

It felt like an unfinished storyboard where things just happen with no rhyme or reason for them. Nothing really progresses the story line.Venom tries too hard to be both a hardcore gory movie and a family movie at the same time. The result is just a mess. The movie reminds me way way too much of SPawn from the 90s. Even the graphics are similar. In fact, spawn might have been better looking. And their powers are way too similar. And Spawn had more gore...lol",Venom
160,Beejerman,CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),7,4 January 2019,"Tom Hardy delivers yet another solid performance in what might be considered to be an underachieving role. Eddie Brock (Hardy), an investigative reporter down on his luck, becomes the unwitting host of an alien symbiote giving him superhuman abilities and powers. Brock thinks he must be going insane, but finally resolves himself to the fact that he has a ""parasite"" and must now learn to co-exist with Venom.It is the story of their battle to stop other symbiotes from invading earth and destroying it's inhabitants - while exposing Carlton Drake, the head of the Life Foundation for the homicidal experiments he conducts in the name of science. Brock finds out that the hosts normally die when taken over by a symbiote, but Venom promises to spare his life if Brock helps him stop the invasion.This was a fun movie, different than most super hero films, and maybe that's why I liked it so much. Tom Hardy does a convincing job in his role with solid support from Michelle Williams who plays the part of Anne, his love interest. This isn't a favorite of mine in this particular genre, but I would certainly watch it again and am looking forward to the sequel.",Venom

I also like how it's not linked to the marvel universe. I enjoy all that don't get me wrong, but it's nice watching a marvel film knowing you don't need to have watched every single one prior!
Downsides to this is that it's not long enough! The plot in certain areas felt slightly rushed, just to get to the next part of the film and so on.

It however can be entertaining, mostly cause of how bad it is. Tom Hardy makes a decent Eddie Brock and probably does the best he can with a script that he has, but ultimately it's a mess of a movie with paper thin plot and backstory and bad guys who make Dr Evil seem as a serious villain! I shouldn't look for a plausible scientific plot in a comic book movie, but I am pretty sure the planet is not one generation away from being uninhabitable.. c'mon!!! Action is mostly a pretty bad CGI mess. The coolest thing about it is Venom's voice.. and his somewhat cool sense of humor, but that's it.",Venom

173,sweidman-28016,Disappointment,4,20 October 2018,"Venom Review:Venom is Sony's new Marvel movie about one of the best antiheroes, Venom. I was excited for this movie. I love Spider-Man a lot and Venom is my favorite Spider-Man villain. Sony also just did Spider-Man: Homecoming which is one of my favorite marvel movies and actually movies of all time because it was done so well. The trailers didn't look that great but I was still hoping it would be good. The reviews came in and I got less exited. This was a huge disappointment. It was trying so hard to be great but there were so many problems. Before the long list of negative here are some positives. I liked Tom Hardy as usual. He wasn't my favorite choice for Eddie Brock but I liked him. I liked the twisted relationship with him and Venom. I really liked the after credit scenes, especially the very last one. The movie seemed to get more entertaining to watch as it went along too. That's about it. Now the negatives. Wow what a bad script. You could tell some scenes were rewritten because they just didn't seem to fit after one another in some cases. This made the pacing choppy. Speaking of pacing, the first 45 minutes were so boring. Nothing was happening. I was wondering if we were ever going to get to Venom because there was just about only one hour left. Finally Venom comes in and it get a little interesting. The CGI wasn't that good I will add. There was action scenes that were just ok. Venom is black and most of the action scenes were at night so you couldn't really tell what was going on sometimes. Also it felt weird when it ended for me. The poor writing just made it seem that the climax of the film wasn't, but I guess it was. Speaking of poor writing, and I won't spoil what it is, but if you have a good ear there is a small DC reference in it. This is a Marvel universe film where DC doesn't exist. That bugged me a lot. The tone felt off for me too. It was an action film that was trying to be like a horror movie with more funny moments in it, which I can kind of see because Venom is supposed to have a twisted sense of humor. The way it came off though didn't work. I think the movie would've also benefited from an R rating. Everything was censored when it shouldn't have been. Rated R Marvel movies like Logan and the Deadpool movies were great. Without those R ratings I think those movies wouldn't be as good. They rating really needed to be changed. Alrighty on to characters. Riz Ahmed played the antagonist, Carlton Drake, and he's a pretty good actor. I really liked him in Nightcrawler. He was horrible in this. I think it was because of his character. Drake was a scientist who doesn't care about people and just about his experiment and power. Nothing else. It reminded me of Yellow Jacket in the first Ant-Man. Michelle Williams was also in this and I didn't enjoy her character much either. Also she was barely in it. She's a very talented actress so I thought they would use her maybe a little more. I don't know what else to write about. All I can say is that I'm very disappointed. Especially with a good director, Ruben Fleischer, who director Zombieland. If you want to see it don't be too surprised if you don't like it. I knew I wasn't going to like it based on the 30% Rotten Tomatoes gave it and 35 by MetaScore. For some reason some audiences have been liking it. On IMDb it has a 7.1/10. And audience score on Rotten Tomatoes is an 89% somehow, which is higher than A Star is Born (very good movie and I will have the review posted soon). I don't know. There was a good performance, good relationship, and it kind of got better as it went along. Also good after credit scenes. Though one is setting up for a sequel which I'm happy for but they'll probably mess up like they did with this. See it if you'd like. I'd suggest A Star is Born, the better release of this past weekend.My Grade: C-",Venom
174,funtasticfour,Better than I expected!,7,17 October 2018,"A lot of critics were harsh on this movie, but after seeing it, I don't understand why. Myself, I was annoyed that Spiderman is not involved as he is in the comic books, but they got around it in a good way, and made a fun movie! The voice of Venom in Eddie's head is my favourite bit, being quite funny. The action is pretty good, but obviously there is a lot of computer effects, because there has to be with a character like this. Perhaps if a bit more time was spent on them, particularly in the end, I'd have given it a higher score, but overall it was fun enough and feels like a fun Marvel movie.",Venom

176,Offworld_Colony,It sure is a shame when a film like Venom comes out and at best it's generic and at worst it's boring.,3,12 February 2020,"A film that seems to have been written in the 90's, desperate to keep a lower budget, a PG13, and a wide audience so it doesn't bother being a good horror, a good antihero movie, or a good sci-fi. It sort of manages to be a passable buddy movie but only just, and probably due to a bonkers Tom Hardy who is clearly having the time of his life.
There's so much in the idea to have unlimited potential, and yet it's a hole-ridden, lily-white superhero film with only marginally more actual Venom than Raimi's Spider-Man 3, and all the beats of a run of a mill early superhero film. Unfortunately since Deadpool, a Venom movie would have to have upped its game. Sometimes it's fun, most of the while, it's depressingly by the numbers.",Venom

178,nikola17,I liked film but could been better,7,20 October 2018,"Now I am not an expert of character Venom, because I am not a big comic book reader at all I thought when I watched this movie it didn't look like it was for kids? This film should have been a R RATED film not a PG-13 rating where Venom biting people heads off I never knew he could do that to me I wanted to see close up shots for it I wanted to see it but no it's PG-13 film ?? this is isn't spider-man or ant-man films this film is dark but not dark enough like R RATED style, I thought this film did good I like it I would watch it again and again. But end of day I would say it's not best movie I have ever seen, because Venom is evil not a Superhero he is anti-hero, Venom is meant to be violent dark, scary like a dark marvel horror movie that's how I wanted to see with Venom sometimes with marvel characters you got to see who they are like dead pool the name what he does it's not a kids movie, like Logan it's not a kids movie or look at blade, punisher they are not PG-13 if they were they would flop ! because those are not friendly type of characters those movies aren't for kids, so as this movie should not be for kids, PG-13 Venom sounds like scary name, he is evil looking would scare every single kid even if I say to my family I would like to see it my family would never let to see it because it looks like a horror movie not a kids PG-13 rating even if they look at rating they won't I wanted to see Hellboy but family didn't let me because I was 4 on that time again it looks like a dark horror sometimes with kids they need to wait because every parent is different if this movie was R RATED it would work a lot better and better over again seeing more violence more close up shots where Venom bites off people heads off, more horror darkness type of thing. Then that's when parents won't let kids to watch it but I don't understand why this PG-13 movie with horror and darkness is and Venom is not a friendly character not hero at all he is evil pure type of character.I thought their things I like about movie the action was fun, the movie wasn't boring like 2 hour long film, it was watchable fast forward not a slow boring type of movie, Tom Hardy I am not biggest fan of him but the role he did was fine nothing wrong with it I never really loved him, I didn't like him in dark knight rises of his mask sounds like Sean Connery. I thought tom is alright actor not best but not fan of him but I like him in this role, Venom was expected to begin both a new franchise and a new shared universe independent of the MCU, and was initially aiming for an R-rating on a smaller budget, inspired by 20th Century Fox's success doing so with the X-Men films Deadpool (2016) and Logan (2017).Sony's director shortlist for the film was believed to include Adi Shankar, known for his dark, R-rated takes ""on the properties he grew up on"" and Adam Wingard I will not be suspired if he directed this movie. I mean as a director I would picked David Leitch or Jonathan Hensleigh they made their marvel movies R RATED and correct and dark as well. But this movie is not acting series like in trailer because in trailer movie looks series but in movie there are some stupid funny scenes like it's trying to be funny but it's not. You can have humour but not going over top, being stupid.I thought villain was very weak actor should got someone else as villain different actor Riz Ahmed very weak villain should different actor to be villain to be that character, Carlton Drake / Riot. I thought he wasn't good villain lame villain very boring. I thought action in movie was fun, I thought direction of this movie is good but at least theirs silly scene when all black staff went into dog I thought that was stupid. I thought some of the dialogue/story is clunky and there's some plot holes and missing info. It should been R RATED because Venom is not friendly character I thought it looked bit lame with Venom is PG should been R RATED. The action is fun but could been a lot better I mean theirs better ideas to have better action scenes. I wanted to be more sequels of this movie but with a different director who could do a R strong RATING of movie sequel needs to be more in proofed like first purge sucked sequel was better Purge Anarchy. Venom is good but not best movie in 2018 I understand the critics are disappointment because Venom is not a friendly character and another thing villain sucked, it should been R RATED showing all violence and gore in film because Venom is not a kids movie it's should be full on violence not PG like Spider-man I am like this isn't Spider-man movie, I think sequel needs different director and writers for venom franchise I am sick and tired of PG-13 I want mega franchise of R RATED dark Marvel movies like this, Venom is not a kids movie not a friendly type this is why it flopped.",Venom
179,SkullScreamerReturns,More interesting than most Marvel movies,6,22 May 2021,"Venom is one of the more interesting Marvel characters because he has different sides. He's like a hero and villain, a man and a monster in the same package, so you never know what to expect.First of all: Tom Hardy makes this movie. He's great cast for the Eddie Brock role. Also how the character is written works really well. There's a lot of humor in how Eddie interacts with the Venom symbiote thing. You could argue if there's even too much of the comedy element but I think it works and makes the movie more unique in the superhero genre which often takes itself too seriously or tries to rely on bad one-liners.The special effects, well, I guess ""ok"" for this type of thing. The Venom ""suit"" looks kind of cool but I'm just not fan of too much digital effects, and I felt like the human acting was better than the action scenes.Not the best Marvel movie but better than most of the Avengers-related stuff.

182,stevenrotherforth,I had a good time but the hardcore fans will probably be disappointed,6,28 January 2019,"VenomVenom is probably a movie that didn't live up to the expectations of the hardcore fans but it is certainly a film that can be enjoyed by the casual viewer.
The greatest attribute that Ruben Fleischer's flick has to offer is its leading star.
Tom Hardy plays failed reporter Eddie Brock who is infected by an alien parasite which gives him superhuman abilities but at the same time burdens him with a Jekyll and Hyde type persona.Hardy is fantastic at playing the two interacting personalities, and it's the comedy that this performance brings that is the highlight of the movie.
Much like the recent film 'Upgrade' which had the central character dealing with a voice in his head.
The movie Venom however isn't of the same calibre as that low budget Sci-Fi proving that all the money in the world can't guarantee a great movie.
Venom certainly isn't great but it is an entertaining romp from start to finish.
Whilst fans of the comic book will agree that opportunities to fully realise Venom on screen have been missed, there's flashes of what could have been.
Like many a superhero origin movie it is hard for the filmmakers to cram everything in within a two hour runtime.
An R rating was also desperately needed here to fully display Venom as a character.
Because this film has been made to be child friendly it suffers from being just another lacklustre superhero movie.
It may please newcomers and a younger audience but it will most likely offend those who have waited a lifetime to have their favourite antihero realised onscreen.In terms of being a technical achievement the CGI is a mixed bag.
Sometimes offering decent visuals.
For the most part though the special effects are a little ropey.
A particular scene where Brock's hand is transformed into Venoms huge fist before he punches a bad guy looks painfully bad.
Other scenes showing Brock morph into Venom also look dated.
The movie has a darkened colour palette too. Almost depressing in its presentation.
Rarely do colours pop, this isn't a vibrant looking film.
The Sound mix on the other hand is ok, good even! But it's no Saving Private Ryan.
All in all I found myself having a good time with this movie.
This mainly down to the charisma of the lead actor.
Every one else in the movie failed to be memorable but helped fill in the gaps between action scenes.
Not a movie worth shelling out for on 4K Blu-ray but one certainly worth renting.",Venom

Whilst you can see lots of elements borrowed from other marvel and superhero films, what actually stands out for me is the performance from Tom Hardy.Strangely I think Hardy's Acting ability is too often missed, because of his heart throb status. I was slightly worried to see him in a film like this , hoping that this wasn't just a tick box role, but the internal fight with his alter ego, resembled that of the struggles with some mental illness conditions and had a much more realistic tone in a fantasy world.",Venom
189,Magow-Intermean,Venom Review,6,25 March 2019,"TV investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is working on an exposé of scientist Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), who is using San Francisco's homeless as guinea pigs to bond humans with aliens. Sneaking into Drake's lab, Eddie's body merges with symbiote Venom who gives him super-strength, a deep inner voice and a huge appetite.
Movies haven't been kind to Venom. Third-wheeling behind Sandman and the New Goblin in Spider-Man 3, and with a background nod in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, David Michelinie and Todd McFarlane's unfriendly neighbourhood symbiote now stars in his own film that mostly botches its attempts to bring the anti-hero to life. Lacking the we-know-how-to-do this confidence of Disney's MCU, Ruben Fleischer's film never finds a strong footing, mixing drab stretches of plot, efficient but flat action, mishandled comedy, a few fun elements and squandering one of the most exciting casts of the year.
The first act is ham-fisted, charmless and dull. There is a protracted set-up where Eddie (Hardy) loses his TV reporting gig, his lawyer girlfriend Annie (Michelle Williams) and his life by going off-message when interviewing scientist Carlton Drake (Ahmed). The latter is pushing forward with dangerous experiments combining humans with symbiotes, icky shape-shifting blobs that enter the body by osmosis. At the same time, there is another symbiote on its way, body-hopping from a paramedic to an elderly Malaysian woman to a little girl on its journey to the States.
Tom Hardy's performance in particular is fidgety, muted and curiously unengaging.
The storytelling here is blunt, but what's even more surprising is the lack of chemistry between Hardy and Williams, two of the most charismatic actors on the planet. Hardy's performance in particular is fidgety, muted and curiously unengaging; Williams also toils away in a nothing-y fiancée-moving-on role. Completing the troika, Venom also has another collector's item - a bland Riz Ahmed turn as an Elon Musk-y visionary saddled with dreadful dialogue (""Find my Symbiote NOW"").
On paper, Fleischer is a good fit for the material. His best work, Zombieland, found a sweet spot of laughs, gore and energy, a good checklist for any Venom movie. Yet he cannot find the correct timbre here. The action, from Brock/Venom brutally seeing off Drake's goons in Eddie's apartment or a bike-car-drone chase, to Venom taking down a SWAT-like team in a smoke-filled foyer, has little verve or spirit and just ends up being deadening. The comedy doesn't land either. Eddie embarrassing himself in front of Annie in a posh restaurant by scoffing lobster and jumping into fish tanks feels too timid to be funny. There is a sense, both through elements of Hardy's physical performance and some of Venom's facial expressions, that Venom echoes The Mask. It wants to be all portentous and Marvel-y (Ludwig Göransson's bombastic score, the end credits malarkey), but channelling Stanley Ipkiss might have been a helluva lot more entertaining.
For, when Eddie finally comes to terms with living with the parasite, there is a hint of a lively back and forth between the two - especially when Eddie refuses to jump from a building - that might have rivalled Deadpool. Perhaps the movie Venom really should have been is its sequel. 'Venom 2: Brock To The Future', anyone?
Venom is neither triumph nor train-wreck. It's a mediocre origin story, a superhero host that sadly fails to bond with its comedy parasite. Which is a shame, as there is enough here to to suggest it could have been a blast.",Venom

This includes entries like 'Venom,' which is something that likely would not have been greenlit years ago.'Venom' stands out from its more family-friendly cousins for obvious reasons. For one, the film's star is not all that good. Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock is a conflicted but good-hearted investigative journalist, but his alter-ego has a mind (and appetite) of its own. Its darkness is an interesting departure from the usual lighter fare, but it's sort of refreshing in a way. The story is nothing special - there's the usual hero arc, duality of good(ish) vs. evil, etc. - but it's not as paper-thin as it could have been.And while this really is the Tom Hardy show, supporting performances from Michelle Williams and Jenny Slate in particular are noteworthy, although Riz Ahmed's Jeff Bezos-esque C-suite supervillain is not all that threatening.Regardless, 'Venom' is a good experiment in the expansion of the Marvel world and demonstrates there's life beyond 'The Avengers.'",Venom

193,jimmycoffin-751-212853,Such a terrible movie,1,22 July 2020,"Venom lacks complete artistic qualities.
Everything screams cgi millennial junk without anything interesting and exciting.
This comes as No suprise because this Is how Most Marvel movies works. Pointless hollow action garbage.
First of all. The symbios should be more like a blsck watery goo. Instead it looks like a crystal shaped blue spiky thing.
There's countless of colorful marvel villains for venom to fight, Instead its the typical marvel all cgi battles and he doesnt meet resistance to the very late fight scene. It would have been a million times better If he actually just fought somebody that wasn't cgi at all. It's just too much of bad videogame graphics involved. Pointless moviemaking and cheap looking fights.
Venom stinks because there's not even one believable fight scene that carries weight.
Deadpool has a number of them. Watchmen works. Batman has the best. Why does hollywood spew out this trash is beyond me? They must be trolling.
Why in earth would anyone like this? It has no exciting story. No exciting love affair. Hej would Eddie ever want the soon to be wife back? They where supposed to be marry then the next day or week she acts like arobot allready dating someone new. She has to feel no symphaty and feelings whatsoever.
And my biggest issue with venom is after credits roll and we get to see carnage? Wait what! Woody Isnt even close looking.
The Only actor in the world that can play carnage to perfection should be Jackey earley haley or even Ben Foster would make him justice.

194,thomasjay-2201,A bit bland,5,18 June 2019,"There's genuinely not much to say about this film at all. Hardy is probably the highlight of it all but the supporting cast are weak generally speaking and the designs of Venom as a being are too obviously fake which sounds stupid but frankly it was mostly jarring to see when the beast eventually appeared. The plot is a bit rushed and seems to rely on some contrived areas but there's the odd enjoyable scene later on which is again largely on the shoulders of the lead actor. Once the credits rolled we have the mid credits scene of Caranage's introduction which frankly does beg the questions of origins and simultaneously looks to be ripped from a fan film with poor quality. In all a weak outing from Sony but could frankly work as a smaller character in a larger film/ensemble, this as an individual film however is frankly middle of the road if not a slight bit dull, might be worth the time on a rainy day but not one I'd rush to rewatch anytime soon",Venom

197,kgprophet,Dysfunctional Frenetic Tone Diminishes Likeability,5,9 October 2018,"One thing that became clear in reviews I read was that this film was disjointed, lacking a consistent tone. Nevertheless I went to see Venom because I like the other films Tom Hardy has been in. Unfortunately, the frenetic feel of the film for the most part is due to Hardy's performance. His behaviour is jerky, impulsive. I think if the tone of his character was more pensive, showing a bit more of a sound mind, he would be more relatable. I suppose when someone is on the skids it is hard to look and act stable. My feeling in general about the story was that it was trying to juggle too many balls at once. Ball One: Breaking up with his fiance. Ball Two: Being fired because of a controversial CEO. Ball Three: Dealing with another entity living in his body. Ball Four: Following a lead on a big story involving that vindictive CEO. Ball Five: Dealing with attempts at treatment with Ex-Girlfriend's new doctor boyfriend. Ball Six: Trying to find a new job. There is also the tired Marvel template of some over-the-top villain who always wants to take over the world. Must they always be trying to take over the world? How about just cornering the market on some new miracle drug (with nasty side effects)? Also present in every Marvel film are action set pieces, usually timed to go off every ten minutes or so. You get a mixed bag of the quality of the effects. The were moments, such as when a person was flung through the air, that didn't feel right. The effect of gravity during some CGI shots don't feel quite right. Saying that, SFO is always a fun playground for big action scenes, and this movie does fine with that. Riz Ahmed plays the big bad CEO, something that now has become generic in superhero movies (Zuckerberg in Batman vs. Superman for example). He partakes in illegal activity, and enjoys immunity from prosecution because of his power of being rich. I found nothing either outstanding or lacking in his one note performance. I blame the script more than him. For the most part the film tries to take a serious tone, however the entity living in Hardy's body is presented with humor. This is one of the more fatal errors of the film. With a dysfunctional tone to begin with, adding humor works against all the serious stuff. There is a scene that feels like it is out a kid's disney film, where Hardy is forced to misbehave in a fancy restaurant. Playing for slapstick humor in this sophisticated script does not work. With that being said, this movie certainly could have been worse. I would say it is about par for the Sony superhero outings. They deliver the goods to a certain degree, but lack the correct tone that Marvel has perfected. Their attempts at Fantastic Four are a good example. I don't regret seeing this in the theater. Timing of the release is one key factor. The post summer 2018 release schedule has been lacking any good action films.",Venom

199,jamiedarlow-37510,A great slice of symbiote entertainment,7,9 February 2020,"Alarm bells started ringing once the terrible reviews came out and the fact that rather being presented by Marvel in the MCU vein is instead ' In Association With Marvel'. These worries were soon put to rest once the film kicks in, mainly thanks to Tom Hardy's fantastic charisma and believable character development of Eddie Brock and the horror theme introducing Venom to finally grace our screens in his own solo outing! I mightely enjoyed this one for the most part; there are a few sequences in particular like the first time Venom is seen in his full form to his manipulation of Brock's body to fight his oppressors that are really fun and just feels so cool to see that this film about such an iconic character has been made. In terms of the story, there are times when the side characters need their screen time and this is when it's in danger of dragging, becoming boring and just doesn't have the pace to keep us interested in these characters. Maybe it's because we just want to see Venom go batcrap crazy more or maybe it's just because the subplots are not as well written. However, this is outweighed by the fact that there is still fun to be had as a whole and it has a good sense of humour running throughout; we did giggle a lot! Director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad) and cinematographer Matthew Libatique (Mother!, Black Swan) bring flair and a gothic sensibility to the visuals which is essential in not just the appearance of Venom but the mood. The Jekyll/Hyde dynamic of Brock and Venom is a wonderfully realised element and makes this one all the more worth a trip to the cinema. The standard post credits Marvel scene is also very exciting with a terrific cameo! Massive well done to the visual and sound effects department for creating some great symbiote sounds and also to composer Ludwig Goransson (Black Panther) for a suspenseful score. Also love the Eminem song!",Venom

201,fciocca,A funny movie portraying the relationship between humans and aliens,7,7 January 2020,"I had many doubts about this movie before watching it. During previous months I heard tons of negative opinions about ""Venom"", so I was completely turned off. Then one day, I really didn't know what to watch, so I remembered this movie. My expectations were really low, and maybe this is why I enjoyed it so much. Eddie Brock is very funny and charismatic. Without any doubts one of the most interesting characters portrayed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Actors were pretty good, but Tom Hardy is outstanding everyone else with his performance, and honestly Michelle Williams that plays Brock's fiance, was pretty sloppy. A real pity, considering that there are many positive and expressive females in almost every Marvel movie such as Carter (in Captain America) or Penny (in the Iron Man Saga).Special effects were stunning and I found some scenes very original and so different than the usual superhero movie. I really like the Venom design. Terrifying and deadly. Creators did a good job. Stunts were amazing, fight scenes are breathtaking.I liked how screenwriters developed the relationship between the alien Venom and Brock. It was for sure a different way to analyze a possible link between humanity and aliens. I don't understand all these critiques related to this movie: it is funny, and for sure a little bit different than the average Marvel movie. I recommend it and I give to it 7 out of 10 stars.",Venom
202,DeBBss,The worst superhero screenplay I have ever seen,3,15 April 2021,"Venom probably has one of the worst superhero screenplay adaptions I have ever seen. It's so terrible that it completely ruins the entire movie. No matter how good the acting or action is, the screenplay drags this movie all the way down. First off, the pacing is horrible. The first act was way too long. It was near the forty minute mark where Eddie finally came in contact with a symbiote. The pacing does get better with acts 2 and 3, but it took way too long for the film to actually get rolling. Secondly, there are way too many plot holes. Why does Carleton Blake want to end humanity when at the beginning of the film he wanted to save and progress it. Why did Venom care so much about humanity even though he barely got to spend any time with humans, except for killing them. How did Carleton Blake not have the same symptoms as everybody else when he got infected.Aside from the dozen plot holes this film has, this movie doesn't explain anything. There is absolutely zero exposition given about Venom or his home world. The symbiote alien thing called Venom is super interesting, and it would've been cool for Venom to explain where he comes from and why he wants to eat life on other planets. This entire film lacks the necessary exposition to tell an interesting story.The villain of Venom is another symbiote that I've already forgotten the name of. I think we maybe got 5-10 minutes of this villain actually doing things. Throughout the first and second act, the villain is just wandering around the world for six months straight. I have no idea what he was doing for six months; but I guess he wasn't urgent to take over the world.So, it's clear that the screenplay is an absolute abomination, now let's get into the good parts of this film. The action is great. I found it entertaining; some action scenes were a little too long, and some too short, but nonetheless, it was great action. The acting is also great. Tom Hardy is one of my favorite actors in Hollywood, and in Venom, he delivers a flawless performance. The supporting cast was good too, but Hardy stole the show. I also really like the chemistry between Venom and Eddie. There's great back and forth dialogue, and the teamwork was good. I think that if we got a new script, but kept the acting, action, and Venom-Eddie chemistry, we could've gotten a good Venom movie.What really scares me is that the screenwriter for this movie is the same screenwriter for the sequel. There has to be big changes so that the sequel doesn't end up like the first. Venom is a 3/10; if it wasn't for Tom Hardy and the action, then this movie would be a 1.",Venom
203,jayjaycee,Communist symbiote and a reporter in a lovely romcom,6,18 November 2020,"""Venom"" is a 2018 science-fiction action film directed by Ruben Fleischer starring Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams.
⚪
All in all, this Sony Pictures superhero flick intoxicates due to the genuinely amusing relationship between the infamous symbiote and his host, and even if it at many occasions poisons itself with forced tameness, cheesiness and genre tropes, the simple yet straightforward story, the surprisingly capable yet not masterfully delivering cast and the tolerable yet not outstanding action sequences make for an extremely enjoyable genre flick that gave the iconic Marvel antihero a decent yet heavily flawed representation that is still a major improvement to the last time.
⚪
If I remember it correctly, the two hottest films in early fall of two-thousand and eighteen were the musical drama ""A Star Is Born"" and this one here. I still can recall it vividly how I have had a date around that time, and how we couldn't decide between those two films. As you can guess, we chose the other film and ended up witnessing a masterpiece on the big screen. However, I think that this comic book adaptation would not have been a terrible choice either. Wait, what? Yeah, you hear correctly, this film would have been a pleasant experience as well. Let's face it, it definitely isn't a great film, but it is an extremely entertaining fun flick, nevertheless. Sony Pictures assigned ""Zombieland"" director Fleischer with the task of cleaning up the mess that the disputed ""Spider-Man 3"" has caused, and honestly, that wasn't that much of a difficult job, as Brock was indeed trash in that film (Emo Parker intensifies). However, it is still not the cinematic representation the famous antihero deserves, as it is still heavily flawed and underwhelming. I haven't read many comics about our favourite symbiote, but I don't have to be a die-hard fan of the source material to understand that one of the most severe issues with this film is the lack of brutality. I am aware that there are some more or less gruesome scenes and moments, but it is still far away from what it should have been. If you want to do a fan pleasing depiction of Venom, the degree of violence must be on a ""Deadpool"" level - so a PG-13 (or 12 rating in Germany) sabotage this undertaking from the beginning. Even though it is an enjoyable film, it is palpable that it primarily served as a cheap cash grab for Sony Pictures who obviously wanted to utilize the hype the MCU films have created. Commercial success is valued over quality, and you can deduce this from how the whole production is designed. It has a generic script that step by step processes the stereotypes of an origin story, displays nothing but an uninspired plot, features a forgettable villain and has nothing I would consider original. Unaware of why, the movie however manages to be a lot of amusement. Former Bane actor Tom Hardy, who has problems keeping his accent correctly, plays the overambitious reporter Eddie Brock who relocated to San Francisco after the disastrous events at the Daily Bugle in New York (was that an inside joke?) and tries to make a living there. After trying to uncover the ugly truth of the Life Foundation and expose the dark deeds of its CEO Carlton Drake (""Nightcrawler"" star Riz Ahmed doing his best as an vicious Elon Musk kind of pioneer), he loses his job, his girlfriend and everything that once made him happy in life. As he then, many months later, gets the chance to uncover the truth with hard evidence, he infects himself with Venom, an alien symbiote that needs a host to survive. Together they decide to stop Drake and save mankind. Believe it or not, that is basically all that there is to it, and nothing more exciting is happening. Why does it still make a lot of fun, though? Well, mainly thanks to the relationship between Venom and his parasite (I meant, his symbiote)! Seriously, how Hardy verbally fights with Venom is pure comedy gold and indescribably entertaining. Like a gay couple, they constantly argue over the smallest things and what to do, and this is downright hysterical. The more chatty, more homicidal and communist cousin of ""The Blob"" (who is also a great marriage counsellor) and the failed reporter are a perfectly mismatched team, and how they both try to do their thing is what defines the mood of this film the most. On the other hand, we have the main villain Carlton Drake, a philanthropist who apparently hates humans (huh?) and wants to save the earth for humanity (despite hating them?). Not surprisingly, he bonds with another symbiote called Riot, and the rest you can figure yourself. Before it gets to the generic ""powerful protagonist fights villain who has the same abilities but is still a little more powerful"" final act, the unlikely team try to get to their destination safely. Despite making use of the abilities of its protagonist, the action sequences are still mediocre and feature nothing exciting at all. Like, they happen, but they don't stick, and after a few minutes you have already forgotten what you have just seen. Is the acting any good, though? Well, Hardy is questionable but sufficiently solid, my beloved Michelle Williams delivers comparatively decent and Ahmed is, well, evincing the typical villain performance. In the end, after Venom in the matter of moments has decided to defend humanity, he faces of with his leader Riot, and a few CGI combat scenes later, Riot explodes in a rocket (don't ask me, it is a stupid idea, I know) and dies, seemingly, like Venom. As it turns out (what a surprise), latter survived and decides to save the world from the bad guys with his buddy. Oh, and then there is the debatable post-credit scene following a cheesy Eminem song that teasers Woody Harrelson as Carnage. In the end, this film is undeniably cheesy, poorly conceived and anything but great. What did you expect from a Sony picture that, ignoring the credits and post credit scenes, runs for merely ninety-five minutes? Exactly. Have I had a good time watching it anyway? Absolutely, cause despite all I have said before, it was a massive, mindless fun that knew to entertain. Hopefully, the next one will be better, until then, I will perceive childlike joy with my newly discovered guilty pleasure.",Venom
204,TheHoodOfSwords,Watch this.,8,14 August 2019,Told really well with convincing enough CGI and well acted just about all around. Main CEO guy wasn't the best villain but he suited ok. Symbiote On Symbiote fights were all amazing and very visually entertaining.,Venom
205,DuskShadow,Need a Symbiote to Remake this ASAP Green Lantern of Marvel Movies,4,5 October 2018,"SPOILER ALERT!I dont know how they got Hardy to do this, he has enough money...Another nail in the coffins for various comic book franchises. The movie had poor acting, hearing Tom Hardy try to sound american always reminds me of the joke from Family Guy where Liam Neeson tries sounding american in westerns.
There was no connection to spider man, though an allusion to the events leading Brock to leave new york (because of spidey in the comics) was dangled like a decayed carrot real quick.
The cgi was a tad lackluster, and the shading and lighting during most of the night and fight scenes were either under done or SUPER FAST-ONE-FRAME-MELDING-INTO-ANOTHER to try and overwhelm not only ones senses, but ones common sensibilities. Oh thingsarelame, but a quickly insertedexplative and the crowd just laughs... YAWN!There was no spidey reference at all, no logo therefore upon Venoms chest, so this must be in another universe as a franchise on its own. I didnt see J. Jonah Jameson, probably because his classic Charlie Chapman/Oliver Hardy ( no relation to tom) moustache would trigger idiots into going off about hitler. >,;,< BUt jameson's son was in the story, which was pivotal to the symbiotes collection by people, but it too felt so rushed and boring. The music was lame, the character development felt forced and bland. AND ITWAS ONLY PG-13. Oh and listening to Hardy talk softly most of the time in half whispers really made me laugh , even during attempted "" serious"" scenes. Aside from that and other lame elements that made me laugh out loud like a stupid little symbiote dog, I fought sleep often and was unimpressed with this movie. At least they went down broadway street for a hot second, but no boobs? YAh some people got their heads bit off, but no brains? Yahs ome people go sliced and diced, but no blood? They would move the camera far back during the killings that were supposed to be brutal and awesome.They made venom lame,weak, and too much of a try hard. And though I was expecting Cleetus Cassidy to be played by somebody big but unworthy, seeing Woody Harrelson with a red ""j fro""... he looked like a combo of Annie and Ronald McDonald. 5.8/10 for this cause Stan Lee had a cameo, and sexy lady venom moment. >,;,< Too many missed chances for greatness though.",Venom

207,gavinp9,"Fun enough, but not spectacular.",6,4 October 2018,"From the director of 'Zombieland' comes 'Venom', a non-Marvel Cinematic Universe film, featuring Spider-Man's arch-nemesis - but no Spider-Man (who's over in the MCU). Since it's a movie about an alien (""symbiote"") turning Eddie Brock (Hardy) into a superhero/antihero, you should suspend disbelief and expectations at the start. The symbiote is brought to Earth by Drake (Ahmed), a Branson/Musk-type who wants to colonize space. He's obviously evil.Anne (Williams) is Eddie's ex and has some scenes, as does Skirth (Slate), who's experimenting on the symbiotes. We finally get to see Venom about 50min in, after quite a bit of unnecessary build-up, and all hell essentially breaks loose. There's a pretty good car chase - we're obviously in San Francisco so the cars can get plenty of air - and some solid action/fight scenes.While it's all quite daft, and some of the scenes have the camera moving way too fast, overall it's Hardy, his charisma, and how he interacts with Venom that make it enjoyable and not totally stupid. The CGI's quite good and it's fun to see some of his powers. There's a few jokes - but definitely don't expect another 'Deadpool'.",Venom
208,thebricks,"Very, very poor script saved by decent acting",7,8 October 2018,"The script was not the best. Several of the plot holes were just horrible, like the lab's terrible security; layaways at Walmart are secured better than the lab where the alien parasites are held. The CGI was absolutely dated, like nineties quality. At no time is the military called, either by the staff at Riz Ahmed's company or by the city of San Francisco. Riz Ahmed's goons also seem to think they can take on Venom with tasers and handguns; even though they totally fail over and over again, no one ever seems to figure out they need another game plan.I think it's pretty obvious this movie was made to boost the value of the character in the interest of making a deal with Marvel someday. The quality of the script was of no concern, which was evident.I'd wait for video if you don't have some unlimited movies plan.",Venom
209,Donatien3,A Missed Opportunity,6,11 December 2018,"After the giant mess of 'Spider-Man 3', the 'Venom' solo movie (with Tom Hardy a more physically appropriate casting than Topher Grace), appeared to do Venom justice.Unfortunately, it's a missed opportunity.Like every origin movie, there's the obligatory set up: Eddie Brock (Hardy) is an investigative reporter, who gets fired after digging to deep during an interview with Carlton Drake/Riot (Riz Ahmed), who is trying to bond alien symbiotes with humans, with deadly results.After splitting up with fiancé Ann (Michelle Williams), Brock freefalls before a concerned Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) contacts him to investigate Drake's symbiote meddling. The Venom symbiote takes Brock as a host.The best part of 'Venom' is the dialogue between Brock and the Venom symbiote (both Hardy); it has a buddy cop vibe (without as much bad language) and is easily the best part of the movie as Brock embraces the symbiote.The off-screen legal issues between Sony and Marvel/Disney means there's no connection to the Spider-Man universe: Venom doesn't have the white spider on his chest. Will Spidey appear in a Venom sequel (if there is one) or will Venom cross over into the MCU for a fanboy-pleasing battle? Hard to say.While the CGI battles between Riot and Venom are brilliant, the film seems stuck between a serious anti-hero movie or a 'Deadpool'-style comedy with Brock and Venom. Had they gone the latter route, it could have been a much better movie.
Hardy is fine as Brock/Venom, but could have been so much better with more interplay with Venom.As it is, 'Venom' straddles an uncomfortable middle ground between super serious and funny.",Venom
210,kermitkid,Hot Reservoir! This was fun!,8,31 March 2020,"I was a bit skeptical when they announced this movie. Could a Venom movie work without Spider-Man? The whole reason the character even exists in the first place is because of Spider-Man. Surprisingly, this movie worked, and it worked well. Yes, the origin story has for the most part been changed, but it still made sense and still worked. Tom Hardy is great in everything he does, and this is no exception. Some of the dialogue is really stupid, and I feel certain scenes could have had more potential, but the stuff that was great was really great. The CGI was terrific, as were the action scenes. The story took a while to get going, but once it did, it really got going. I think this is one of those movies that has enormous potential, but it will never be fully realized, and everything it's setting up will sadly be cancelled. This has happened with ""Cirque Du Freak"", ""Valerian"", and others, and I feel this is going to join the ""Potential franchise ends up being one and done"" club, which is a shame. I want to see more of this!

214,ayoreinf,For daring to be savage,8,8 October 2018,"Once again I break my own rule of not writing review for films with over 500 reviews (that is, over 500 when I write my review). I liked this movie because it dares doing a few unthinkable things for a Hollywood action film. It dares showing, in a manner of speaking some collateral damage. I mean - in so many Hollywood action films bullets are flying all over the place in the busiest streets without a single bystander getting a scratch. In this movie they do get hurt, most of the time we see it off screen, but we see it, the movie acknowledge the fact the innocent lives are lost. For a comics based movie, thats as close to realism as they can (and should) get. 
 Another place where the movie is possitively daring, is in daring to show Venum as the character he was created on the comics, a savage predator, with very little noble emotions or caring thought for anyone other than its own self preservation. The movie does veer off the original comic book story of origin, but it keeps the comics book nature of the beast, and that's a big plus in my personal book.Other aspects of movie making: let's not speak about CGI anymore, I think it's a mere technical issue, and there'll always be those who say the CGI was lame. It wasn't but it's not a surprise, it's the way it is. The actors are very good, and I liked the fact Tom Hardy gets to play a comic character with his own face. I hated his mask when he was Bane. It was part of the character, but it killed half the potential of real acting in that film. Here he gets to really act, and he's great. Michelle Williams is as charming as ever, and perfect for the role, and Riz Ahmed is a very good villain. Jenny Slate should get more screen time, she's a great sctress, who doesn't get half the credit she deserves.Altogether, a great, slightly different sort of comic movie, if it wasn't a bit rushed with the convertion of Venum, I'd rate it even higher.",Venom
215,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Not a bad movie at all and not a great origin movie either but a lot of fun,6,8 February 2019,"Venom is not a bad origin movie and is not that great either, but it is a lot of fun. Do I think is better than Spider-Man 3? No, but I did had a lot of fun. Tom Hardy was okay in his role as Eddie Brock wasn't believable enough like Topher Grace. Michelle Williams is now old and really ugly. Couldn't they find a better actress more beautiful actress to play Anne Weying Brock's love interest?The bad: there is no Spider-Man in the film and no one from Spider-Man universe is in this film. Could have bee a little better. The action sequences could have been better done. Michelle Williams is ugly and horrible they should have find better actress not an old nanny to play Brock's love interest. It could have been a better villain and more monsters in the film it wasn't. We could have seen a better bad guys. Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake / Riot was the weakest villain in a superhero movie. The story was a rip off from I Come in Peace aka Dark Angel (1990) in which an alien is killing people to get the drugs and he wants to go home and if he come back with his kind there would be a slaughter. In here Carlton Drake is killing people with the hosts and his new host Riot wants to go home with the rocket and bring others of his kind to destroy this world. Brock and Anne try's to stop him. Michelle Williams in my opinion is useless. The story could have been better, but time from time was boring.The good: I appreciate what elements Ruben Fleischer brings to this film from the comic, specifically, the Venom symbiotic. Tom Hardy was okay as Eddie Brock not better than Topher Grace in my opinion. I like his acting, but the stunts he didn't do it him self. I also think Tom Hardy is getting old and his not in best shape. If you watch chase in the woods in which Biock runs away from security guards, that is not Hardy that is his stunt double. Hardy can't run. His not in his shape. Is Hardy getting old or lazy? If I would play a super hero I would demand to make my own stunts, even running stunts. Not some guy with black hair who looks like Ross from Friends. Good action sequences, good music could have been better. Good CGI FX effects I like it. It did had a lot of humor I like that. It wasn't dark really good thing. The fight between Venom and Riot was okay but could have been much better.I did hear that they are planning making a sequel and Venom 2 will be better than the first one I hope so. This movie is similar to The Guyver (1991) I hated the first movie but Guyver: Dark Hero (1994) was improvement over the first one and was much better than part I. So I can't wait for Venom 2.I like Venom as a time waster, I wasn't excepting a great movie but it was a decent origin story. I don't hate the film, but I like it for a bit.",Venom

His girlfriend is a lawyer played by Michelle Williams.This origin story reveals that the bad guy, billionaire Drake, sent a rocket ship to space that came back with multiple Symbiotes, the body-sucking parasites that take you over, like Venom. No spoilers there. Drake is using his science labs to do some experimentation. Things get out of control and one of the symbiotes, named Venom, latches on to Eddie.The first part of the movie is a bit slow, up until Eddie meets Venom. Then the fun begins. As the movie proceeds, it becomes hilarious to see Eddie and Venom interact with each other. It's almost like Eddie has a somewhat-controlled Hulk that he can call out when needed to fight the bad guys.The movie then becomes mostly chase scenes and fight scenes. Over and over. That gets a bit tiring, but you get so see a lot of cool CGI effects for Venom.
The movies ends with an obvious hint that things will continue in the Venom world - I think they have a winner here.Tom Hardy delivers some strong acting. He also does the voice of Venom, which illustrates his strong voice skills. My biggest ding is the chemistry between Hardy and Williams. It's a lackluster sizzle. Perhaps a casting issue. Williams delivers a just ok performance. Otherwise, the big star is CGI because Venom is all over beating up bad guys and eating their heads, much to the dismay of Eddie.Altogether, a pretty good movie that ends up really delivering in the second half. Venom will be trained by Eddie to fight for the good guy in sequels it seems, which could deliver fun vigilante times like The Equalizer, The Girl in the Spiders Web, or Death Wish.
Enjoy.",Venom
217,CountJonnie,Tom Hardy saves the day,7,22 November 2018,"Venom doesn't succeed on many levels, but it does two good things. It succeeds into focussing on Venom seperate from Spider-Man, and Tom Hardy is amazing.As a movie, Venom is rushed. The movie feels short and there's too little development for the relation between Venom and Eddie Brock. Riz Ahmed is an amazing actor, but his bad guy performance is uninspired and generic. Besides that, some of the action reminds me of horrible CGI.But the saving grace is Tom Hardy. His acting is flawless and he makes Eddie Brock unlikable and likable at the same time. Besides the serious moments, Tom/Venom have some of the best timed and funniest moments I've seen in an action movie in a while. Tom Hardy succeeds into making Venom more than just Spider-Man's enemy. This alone makes the movie Venom the success it was never ment to be.",Venom
218,WalkdenEntertainment,"Thankfully this is not a ""Turd In The Wind""...",6,15 November 2018,"A well known TV reporter, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is at the top of his game and a respected man within his city. He lives with his girlfriend (Michelle Williams) and life for Eddie is overall good... until...Eddie Brock is asked to investigate a celebrity, but he pushes the boundaries during the interview, costing him his career and sadly his girlfriend. Eddie is down on his luck until he continues to investigate the assigned case and comes in contact with an alien-type symbiote which releases an alter-ego character known as VENOM.For those who are unaware, this film is a stand alone film and can be watched without viewing all of the previous Spider-Man instalments, or the other Marvel films. To this day I have always been a huge fan of Spider-Man and also admit to a guy crush (aka guy love) on the actor Tom Hardy. In my opinion, the man can do no wrong in cinema today. From the announcement of this film and seeing the trailers, I could only pray this film could finally do what Spider-Man 3 failed to do back in 2007.I'm proud to say that Tom Hardy who plays Eddie Brock (and provides the dark deep voice of Venom) is incredible. Eddie Brock as a character is believable and even more so once he comes in contact with Venom. Eddie at times looks his absolute worst and somewhat gross as a result of his new encounter with the symbiote. Venom as a character looks and sounds amazing. The power combined of both Eddie and Venom is where the review score points come into play (even if some patience is required to get things underway). Once the 1st act has passed, the film goes into full gear.My disappointments; however, are found with those characters around Eddie & Venom. This includes the performance of Eddie's girlfriend (Michelle Williams), who I found unbelievable and annoying on screen (sorry, I'm just being honest here!). Similar comments could be made about the film's villain who also just doesn't feel right given the film's dark and gritty tone. Don't get me wrong, I feel these actors are awesome, but how they have been used along with the film's dialogue feels poor considering how much screen time they take up.I also found myself distracted during multiple occasions with some of the film's editing choices. Some scenes have unexpected cuts and edits that simply don't make sense or match up. One example is Eddie walking down the street during bright daylight, then suddenly after walking into a store it is night time outside. Slightly annoying and disjointed moments like these kept me thinking that I was missing out on other scenes or large cuts were made. Either way, I felt like there should be an unedited/uncut version coming to Bluray (fingers crossed). Either way, as a result of the editing some moments don't feel like a final product.Overall, I'm thankful to witness a greater version of the well known Marvel character ""Venom"". On screen Tom Hardy (as one would expect) does not disappoint or fail this role. I did; however, felt rather disappointed by the surrounding characters and bizarre editing choices that I found rather distracting or annoying. Hopefully corrections are made should we ever see... a sequel.5.7/10

221,bazookamouth-221-898097,Great movie!,8,8 October 2018,"Ignore the critics for sure. This is a great movie. If maybe a little short in running time but it is great fun. Tom Hardy was fantastic in the role and the Venom voice , sometimes funny was the best part of the movie. Loved it.",Venom
222,SafReviews,Decent,7,13 February 2019,"Thought i was going to hate this movie because of all the negative reviews from the critics, but I actually liked it. To be honest, the begging of the movie was boring, like the first 20 minutes, but after that it got a bit intriguing. The plot is probably not the best compared to other superhero films, but it was good enough. The action scenes were amazing and is the reason why the movie is thrilling and became a box office hit. For a movie that is only 1hr 35 minutes long which is short compared to most superhero movies, this was good and i recommend anyone to watch it.",Venom
223,Quebec_Dragon,Feels like a cash grab and a throwback,3,4 October 2018,"As other reviews pointed out, the tone was all over the place and the comedy didn't mix well with the darker parts. As a horror movie, it failed because there was poor tension, creepiness and no gore despite the potential. As a comedy it failed because it was not really funny for me even though some Venom fans laughed at his every line (why?). The action parts were too busy, chaotic and hard to follow, especially when Venom was involved. Tom Hardy really tried hard and emoted a lot, sometimes too much, but ended up looking goofy and dumb too often. The events of the plot felt rushed, and sometimes downright stupid. In fact, repeatedly, the behaviour of the characters didn't seem believable. Overall, this movie irritated me and reminded me of bad, older superhero movies (even though Venom is no superhero, I know). I watched this at an advance screening in a full theatre, and there was no applause at the end.Rating: 3 out of 10 (poor)P.S. For Marvel fans, there's no real connection to the rest of the universe, so you can easily skip it or wait for home viewing.",Venom
224,undeaddt,"Very interesting Marvel character, but a badly executed movie.",6,29 January 2019,"Venom is one of the most unic and interesting Marvel characters of all time, but yet for me this movie doesn't make the cut and delivers way less than what a character like Venom deserves. I like Tom Hardy and his acting skills, altho I don't like the tone in which he speaks during the whole movie like someone is choking him all the time. My second main issue is the fact that we saw little to none about the antagonist, the anti-hero in the movie, which is a let down. I hope that the sequal involving Carnage will bring more action and deepness to the movie as a whole franchise, giving more meaning and quality to the first movie also all together.",Venom

226,patriciogl10,Disgustingly average.,5,13 November 2019,"Honestly, I didn't care much for Venom. The story was barely entertaining and was met with so many flaws. Not even a magnificent actor like Tom Hardy could save this movie from being yet another comic book movie from the bunch. I've read other overstated reviews praising this film as if it was excellent; but it's hardly any good. The CGI fails to deliver a simple visual representation, it's way overdone and doesn't reflect fittingly in the screen.Tom Hardy tries but can't seem to make a flawed script work with his acting, which I find it to be average. Venom's look, CGI and symbiote voice was the only thing that truly appealed to me about this film. But of course it's not enough, although it deserves some points in that aspect.
I completely forgot Michelle Williams is in this too, so imagine how plain and nondescript her perfomance is.Invest in this film if you wish to, I can't guarantee you'll enjoy it.",Venom

231,itsbobr,"Not Scary, but Highly Entertaining",9,19 December 2018,"An alien Symbiont attaches to Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and they form a symbiotic relationship. Venom looks like a very big black snake with huge teeth and can stretch itself into almost any shape. Don't let young children watch. It's not that they will be scarred for life. Oh, no, if you let them watch they will have nightmares and wake you up often. You don't want that. You need your sleep. See?Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) sends out space ships in the hope of bringing back alien life forms to help humans form a symbiotic relationship in order to save the human race, which is now seen as declining and Drake believes humans will disappear without that alien help.How does Eddie get infected with Venom? Doctor Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) brings Eddie (who is a TV Journalist) into the lab to have Eddie expose Drake in what he is doing because Drake has humans to test the alien life forms and the humans die. Eddie is told not to touch anything in the lab, but he does. Venom (Also Tom Hardy) attaches itself to Eddie.The rest of the movie has Drake and his henchmen trying to get Eddie back to save his life so he says. And we will see some very good stunts and CGI. Oh, Drake becomes infected, too, and we see a fight at the end between Good Venom and Bad Venom.Notables: Michelle Williams as Anne Weying, Eddie's finance who breaks off the wedding as she was fired because Eddie did a too brutal and honest interview with Carlton Drake; Scott Haze as Roland, Security Chief for Drake. Peggy Lu as Mrs. Chen, store owner of a store Eddie visits; Reid Scott as Dr. Dan Lewis, the new boyfriend of Anne after she dumps Eddie.There are many chuckles in here as we enjoy the banter between Eddie and Venom. Venom does admit coming to Earth to destroy it and eat the people, but learns from Eddie to have some ""humanity.""I hate to say this but I think we will be in for sequels. We do see Stan Lee near the end.Let some of the credits run and then you will see Eddie go to a prison to visit a prisoner named Cletus Kasady, played by Woody Harrelson. See, sequels are being formed. Then let the rest of the credits run and you're done. Enjoy.

233,ivanmessimilos,Critics are wrong,7,7 October 2018,"After lot of hero movies now its time for antiheros who got their place in title roles. Deadpool brake the ice. Venom is a darker figure, but has a PG-13 tag to attract a wider audience. The movie (unfortunately) has very little touch points with the comics and I think there will be a lot of objections here. Also since this is the origin story, I miss more minutes to tell the story a little bit better, and I read that they cut off some 30 minutes of film and sometimes you can feel it. Hardy is therefore excellent, dominating as Brock / Venom faces, wicked, even fun when it's needed. There was no support from other actors, but I blame scenario that is not good and it has illogicality.
The film is not superb, it is not a top, but I think it has served purpose, fun action, depending on earnings, will provide one or two sequels. Critics are a little overdone, definitely worth a look at the movie even if you're a hardcore fan of Venom (like me), watch without prejudice. Rating: 👍🏻",Venom
234,FelipeCarrillo,"A flawed, erratic film adaptation for one of the most famous, savage and finest Spider-Man villains",5,18 December 2018,"Marvel Comics, the glorious House of Ideas of a troubled age, is one hell of a phenomenon. It has not only been at the top films at the global box office each year or nearly utterly ruled the superhero genre for ten years now, but also its characters and stories have stuck voraciously in the pop-culture of an entire century. Stronger than ever and about to wrap the most important phase of its timeline up, the subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company has ventured deeper into the industry by ordering new TV shows, a wide range of merchandising, books and comics; an expected movement if you know who's behind all this, of course, Disney is and as a proof just look at the reborn ""Star Wars"" saga. Invading unexplored places, it made the decision to expand one of its most acclaimed multi-universes: Spider-Man's. Tom Holland caught everyone off guard by putting the spider suit on in ""Captain America: Civil War"" two years ago contracted not only by Marvel Studios, but also Sony Pictures. Co-producing Spidey's solo outings because of a fruitful agreement finally signed between both studios last year, Marvel is generous, but not trusting, therefore, still has most of the creative control over the projects. The companies' deal for Spider-Man's rights doesn't include movies as part of the gargantuan MCU, instead, Sony is up to conditionally weave standalone films - such as the ""X-Men"" franchise, ""Deadpool"" and ""Fantastic Four"" by 20th Century Fox, - and all the box office bank still goes directly to them. Sooner than later, Sony Pictures revealed the list of upcoming productions, among which was one of the Marvel's most ambitious ideas that got stuck in the infamous development hell for almost ten years: Venom.In a world with too many superheroes, an anti-hero might be the most befitting antidote to fresh up the heroism-and-rightness-populated scene; as far as cinema is concerned, DC goes ahead of it, with ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Watchmen"" on opposite corners of the same ring. Marvel has followed much the same pattern, going through fire and water to conceive a new gem as piercing as original after bringing the Merc with a Mouth to the big screen; alas, has made the same mistake of its top contender.
At the last minute, ""Venom,"" which was supposed to keep going R-rated comic book adaptations, took a left turn, an utterly financial one, losing its primal R rating to drown in PG-13 waters. The film stumbles quick-fire, toning down material that must be naturally and strictly violent, extreme and frightening; the artistic vision opted to fall off from the original source in tone, becoming a mainly comedy amalgam lacking in visual appeal that if wasn't for the central figure's commitment, would easily have been on the darker side of the Marvel universe. After a hellish pre-production process, it's strange why Ruben Fleischer was the one to sit in the director's chair, a filmmaker renowned mainly for wisecracking ""Zombieland."" Marvel looking for new, fitting voices to take over its emblematic worlds is entirely understandable, however, it seems self-defeating to pick up a cinéaste who doesn't deeply know the company's storytelling-filmmaking dynamics. It's no surprise that Fleischer does a great job erecting a messy occasionally-watered-down buddy-comedy that shines by the symbiote-host duality employed incredibly halfway the running. The idea is hilarious off and on, aligning storytelling and performance organically, however, after Eddie comes to terms with the ""parasite,"" this funny underpinning spreads out abruptly along the ham-fisted third act.On the contrary, superhero-action-wise, the filmmaker gets unmistakably lost in a disaster of plots, skipping from a breakup with Anne Weying to a ""The Terminator""-esque body-hopping around the globe that reminds Disney Channel's ""Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior."" Poorly original and harshly introduced, such narrative threads run down the golden reputation the anti-hero has achieved in the comics pages along the years. By far it was clear this director wasn't a healthy choice for the character and yet Sony and Marvel refused to change its plans; we have now a Venom movie, a shonky superhero movie, and a good comedy at once, which, according to predictions, has put the worldwide box office on fire.
In a feature film that takes nearly forty minutes to land, the tone and pace are atrocious, yet there doesn't lie its greatest sin. ""Venom"" is on a knife-edge because of visual raucousness. With a hilariously bad CGI, the pictures, ironically composed by the very same cinematographer responsible for the dreamy urban landscapes from Bradley Cooper's Oscar-hungry ""A Star Is Born,"" suffer from a serious on-screen incomprehensibility reinforced by an oversaturation of black at key moments. Matthew Libatique won't ever be a bad cinematographer, he's flat-out an artist, hence it's far-fetched to see these opaque, ghastly set-pieces, visually unappealing, scrambles of semi-liquid creatures fighting on the screen untidily. Visually and narratively, this is oddly an outdated flick, coming likely from the 2000s, long before DC-Marvel's monopoly was a reality; nowadays, the movie feels out of place, an aesthetically huge misfire.The core cast is made up by four actors. Michelle Williams is larger-than-life love interest/ex-fiancé Anne Weying in the style of Jane Foster or Lois Lane; however, Williams' character is far from reaching the same plot importance of the previous two women; notwithstanding, the four-time Academy-award nominee embraces her role, understands it and does her best to attempt at shaping a fine audience-actor link.Jenny Slate as Dr. Dora Skirth doesn't mean a special addition, a disposable character that helps to move the plot forward; her performance, reserved and shy, is goodish, free of edges, one more prey of a wretched screenplay.Riz Ahmed, who is used to delivering good performances, as Carlton Drake/Riot is a half-baked villain, I.E., his motives do not convince, his actions fueled by stereotyped gears do not infuse fear or dislike, his bad boy is nothing more than the heartless monster of a corporate experiment who will destroy the world in favor of evolution; Ahmed should never have signed up for this.But who really does the ""heavy-lifting"" is the fantastic Tom Hardy. Praised by his taciturn, top-notch performances in masterpieces directed by Christopher Nolan and George Miller, Hardy grinds away at his physical performance portraying both the Symbiote and Eddie Brock, two roles close to his career. The ""Locke"" actor endows the exact dose of charisma and intensity, leaning heavier on gags and one-liners than awardable dramatic explorations, still the firm pulse and commitment the actor adds the role makes the offering stronger.Don't be deceived, Sony is sliding us into a post-factual, misleading ground, it's crystal-clear Daniel Espinosa's ""Life"" is related to all this.""Venom"" by Ruben Fleischer is neither a rotten film nor the most outstanding comic book adaptation coming from Spider-Man Sony-Marvel deal; at heart, a messy buddy-film of great inner comedy scope that rarely dabs at the source material in tone and pace; in appearance, a long-drawn-out fandango of obscure frames and unintelligible action sequences that provides neither the theatrical drama nor the visual spectacle the most renowned Spider-Man villain deserves. With an unexpected, enticing post-credits cameo, a mightily effective soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson - going viral at the expense of Eminem, - brilliantly comical fitfully and celestially saved by Tom Hardy's talent, ""Venom"" will please stop-and-go cinemagoers and the most loyal but uncommitted aficionados. It is certainly far from being the comic book adaptation must-watch was meant to be; Sony and Marvel didn't fight the parasite off, we do.",Venom
235,GunnersMate,Not Epic - Very Enjoyable,8,6 October 2018,"As the latest installment in a sea of Marvel characters brought to the screen, the bar is set high and the expectation for cinematic ""awesomeness"" is inevitable. While Venom was not as epic in scale and delivery as those in the same genre that have come before it, it was a fast-paced, visually intensive, funny, and ultimately entertaining two hours of story-telling. Eddie Brock was very human (and ultimately - as this is first and foremost an origin story - very alien) character with plenty of heart to overshadow his faults. Venom's strength lies in the fact that Eddie Brock's interactions with his lady-faire, the various people in his life, and his titular parasitic companion are interesting even without the obligatory bad-guy to fight. Some CGI in the film could have been stronger, but when it works, it works brilliantly; and while there is comic-book predictability to the plot, the story is enjoyable enough that the shortcomings are only a slight distraction to a movie which is ultimately worth a second (or third) watch.",Venom
236,GunnersMate,Gets Better Every Time You See It,8,1 January 2019,"As I did not read the Venom comic books, this reviewer's knowledge of the character Venom was admittedly a minimum. Saw this movie in the theater opening weekend and was so pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Not perfect by any means - but in an era when we are deluged with big budget superhero movies, Venom quickly carved out its own piece of the super-real-estate. It is big, bold, fast-moving, unapologetic, and very very funny.Tom Hardy is all-in and a terrific flawed and relatable character set (as both human Eddie Brock and his symbiote Venom) and Michelle Williams is a sharp-witted and modern partner. In fact, the vast majority of the cast is so remarkably likable (with the noted and obvious exception being the perfectly icky and slimy Carlton Drake (with some scene-munching supplied by Riz Ahmed) that the viewer can't help but enjoy the ride and forgive any cinematic weaknesses.With Venom now available for the home-viewer, this origin story is a no-brained go-to for multiple viewings - and it just gets better every time you see it. Enjoy.",Venom
237,jackgdemoss,This is NOT a venom movie.,7,12 October 2018,"PG-13. Comedic tone. Buddy comedy. This was NOT venom. This film is so difficult to give a fair rating. On the one hand, it stood very well on its own two feet. It was funny, well-paced, and had some really good-looking action scenes. On the other hand, it is being marketed as a VENOM movie. Venom is not some goody parasite that is willing to take orders from his host. 
 Most films benefit from tail coating on a brand name character, but this film was severely hindered by it. If you call this movie ""Symbiosis"" and market it as non-marvel, it is an 8/10 solid film for the whole family. I would much prefer a Venom title to be rated R, dark, gritty, and not holding back the punches. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and believe others should see it, but please do not go in with the mindset that you are about to see the Venom you know and love on the big screen.",Venom
238,carlos37andre,Why PG?,6,28 December 2018,"The movie is entertaining enough, but it could have been much better if they haven't going with the PG.Let me take this out of the way, I wasn't on board with this movie since the beginning (why would you do a Venom movie, without Spider-Man? It's insane). However, I have to say that I've enjoyed the movie much more than I thought I would. The movie is fun, mainly after we see the ""real Venom"", it becomes an entertaining dark comedy almost body-cop movie.With that being said, we can't help but think that the movie actually could have been pretty awesome if they had gone for the rated R. And is odd to think about that, Logan and Deadpool (twice) have already showed us that you can make a superhero movie that don't try to reach as many people as possible, and instead focus on being the best as they can for the older audience. And let's be honest here, Venom is a huge monster that eats people's head... do I have to say something else?Anyway, the movie has a pretty basic storyline, the villain is just kind of an evil scientist, as we have seen lots of times before, but it's fine. The acting is good for the majority of it. The soundtrack is a bit odd at times (with some pop/hip hop songs that didn't quite land every time).Overall, I think that's it. The movie is very fun, mostly when we start to see the relation Venom x Eddie. I believe that a sequel has potential, but they really should stop this nonsense and do a rated R movie.",Venom

241,virindra,"Nice, but not great.",7,3 October 2018,"The reason I loved The amazing spiderman, was because I could see the lizard very well. In this movie, Venom is dark and vague, in front of a dark background. I could not see Venom well. That was a pity.Humour was great, action not that much. People say it reminded them of Spiderman 3. This was nothing like that! This Venom was tougher, someway funny in a good way. The psychology between Eddy and Venom was not worked out well. In the beginning Venom wanted to destroy the earth and at the end he wanted to save it. Why? What happened?Movies with anti heroes are not new, like deadpool, Logan. And there are more to come from Image comics like Spawn and The darkness. My advice, if there will come a sequel with Carnage, give it more action and detailed views of Venom and Carnage. Don't make it such a blur. That's not fun to watch.I watched this movie in 4D. Was fun, not that awesome. It's in the testfase.",Venom
242,harrylosborne,Your run-of-the-mill superhero film with slightly more violence,4,21 February 2019,"I decided to wait until this film had been out for a month or two, seeing as the initial reviews were so mixed (verging on poor). Having now watched Venom, I can see how both a critic and your average film fan would feel after seeing this.On the whole, Venom doesn't offer anything new: cliched jokes, standard fight scenes and the superhero trope of underdog survival everywhere. The most disappointing aspect of the film was, in fact, Tom Hardy; his acting felt forced and unnatural, a far cry from his villainous performance as Bane in the Dark Knight Rises.Overall, Venom for me doesn't earn itself a sequel or any continuation, a shame considering the strong character background given when exploring Venom itself; however, if you're a fan of the genre and don't mind a classic slash and hack film, then you may enjoy this more than I did.",Venom
243,kevinxirau,Quite the killer.,7,12 October 2018,"Being that it's October, the month of monsters, there couldn't have been a more appropriate superhero to come out than Venom. Easily one of the most popular Spider-man characters, he made his big screen debut in 2007's ""Spider-Man 3"", which not only failed to impress audiences, but proved to be a great disservice to Venom. Luckily, Sony makes up for this grave mistake with this new film. Plot: Tom Hardy is Eddie Brock, a journalist digging into the dirty secrets of the shady corporation, the Life Foundation, where he becomes an unwilling host to an alien Symbiote brought to Earth by a rocket ship. As the unlikely pair of man and ravenous parasite endeavors to find a compromise, they must become one as Venom to both survive and prevent more symbiotes from making Earth their new home. Right off the bat, they got Venom right; the internal struggle, the design, and the twisted sense of humor. Hardy gives a well-acted performance as both Eddie and the Symbiote, the two halves bouncing back and forth in a terrific fashion. They alone sell this flick. The supporting cast holds up too with Michelle Williams as Anne Weying doing a good job playing the love interest with a believable relationship. The nods to previous media are also welcome with the mid-credit scene making me geek out. One word best describes the action: savage. The movie works around its PG-13 rating with some satisfyingly kickass fight scenes that get away with nasty-looking deaths (would've preferred rated R, but it works nonetheless). ""Venom"" starts a little slow, getting you into the cast and story organically, but once the titular anti-hero comes out to play, things become seriously fun. An issue that didn't really ruin it for me was that the climax has Venom battling a similarly colored villain (Riot) in a night setting, which made it tricky to see what was going on at times (a differently colored nemesis would've fixed this). The music fits the film as well, having a cool edgy, pseudo-horror vibe to it. All in all, ""Venom"" is a killer good time. Future films are already planned, so I look forward to seeing the toothy alien freak in action once more.",Venom
244,LukeCustomer2,Wasn't great.,5,11 April 2020,"100% of this movie that is good is Tom Hardy. He brings a character and stature to this movie that elevates the poor script. However, the script is quite bad without Hardy would have been a turkey.The entire first hour of the script is set up for the plot but in no way does it need to be that long. The movie wants to establish that Brock is a rebel journalist in love with Anne and that the evil ""life foundation"" is up to nefarious things. All of this could have been done in 15 minutes. Instead of scene after scene of Brock and Anne with happy looks on their faces -- all they needed to show is just one of them living a normal couple life. The audience could have filled in the rest.Once symbiosis happens, there is a good and long action sequence. Great... but then there is another one right afterward... throwing off the flow of the plot and taking time from the best part of the movie, Brock and Venom.Just about everyone but Hardy is horrible here. Michelle Williams doesn't have much to work with but she has an obvious wig and a plastered smile. Jenny Slate as a brilliant scientist? HA! And she is utterly stupid as she easily is manipulated by the bad guy. Riz Ahmed is just a one note bad guy that could have been so much more. It felt like a lot of the movie was left on the cutting room floor.",Venom
245,aheaven2005,A Really Fun Ride,8,23 July 2021,What a nice short but fun ride through the genesis of a super character. Tom Hardy offers a great performance and really propels the movie. Oh and from a technical point of view it's also flawless in both audio and image.,Venom
246,AdrenalinDragon,Not enough Venom injected to make a good movie,5,3 October 2018,"Believe it or not, I had hopes that Venom might have been good. Not great, just good. Those expectations fell not too far into the movie, before Venom even showed up. The jokes were falling flat, everyone was getting frustrated with Eddie (Tom Hardy) being quite irritating, and nothing much entertaining was happening on-screen. We were all waiting for Venom to actually appear.It wasn't all doom and gloom though. Once Venom finally shows up, it gets a bit better. For example, when Eddie and Venom are actually bantering and telling each other off, it can be entertaining in parts and showed some potential with Venom's character. Definitely the closest anyone got to laughing in my fully packed cinema. That's another problem with the movie, though. It's quite hard to tell what's supposed to be funny and what isn't sometimes. It really is all over the place. I don't know who thought toning it down to PG-13 violence was a great idea. It was disappointing they cut so much content out of the movie.Most of the performances were average. The CGI was not that great. Felt a bit dated and Venom didn't look that convincing for the most part. The soundtrack was passable, I suppose. Nothing really memorable. Most of the movie was mediocre/passable. As I said before, the highlights are when both Eddie and Venom are the focus together, but when it turns to the other characters it becomes a bit dull again. The action sequences range from mediocre to passable, but nothing really stands out as memorable and stuff you haven't already seen loads of times before in superhero movies. You can predict most of the plot and the twist and turns from a mile away. The villain was generic and not all that exciting. I'd suggest sitting through the post-credits sequence though. Overall I don't feel Venom was completely unwatchable, but could have been alot better. Adding Spider-Man to the mix would have probably elevated it quite a bit alone. Overall the negatives/blandness of Venom prevent it from being a good movie. I'm still unsure if I'd like to see a sequel to it in the near future.5/10",Venom
247,donttouchmeprimate,Alright then..,3,31 August 2020,"I'm too tired to even bother pointing out how basic and copy n paste this film is. Just a bland mix of average story, average acting and below average entertainment.God damn I miss Brexit",Venom
248,peeedeee-94281,Mediocre Marvel Movie,4,26 October 2018,"I don't know if this movie was geared towards fans of the comic, because I couldn't relate to the characters at all. I didn't believe Tom Hardy's performance, it just felt that he wasn't suited to the role. His relationship to Michelle Williams felt forced, there was no chemistry between them. And the 'bad guy' was just some geek corporate guy. He didn't feel intimidating at all.
Anytime Venom or the other alien popped up on the screen, it took me right out of the movie, I felt I was watching an animation film instead of a live action flick. It wasn't that funny, how did Venom know all those phrases. Why did these aliens give themselves english word names?!
And then the bonus scene, are we going to get a combination of joker and ronald mcdonald in the next movie?
Overall this was a pretty dull superhero movie. I was hoping to enjoy it, but the critics got this one right.",Venom
249,Jared_Andrews,It's occassionally fun but mostly dumb,3,5 October 2018,"Venom the movie, much like Venom the character, is a sloppy, amorphous mishmash that attempts to be too many things and ultimately fails at all of them. At various times, it tries its hand at horror, slapstick comedy, self-aware comedy, romance and drama. That's an ambitious combination that would make any movie difficult to take seriously, let alone one with a wisecracking alien blob monster.The chilling opening scene shows a private space exploration mission return to Earth with samples of alien symbiotes. Shockingly, something goes wrong, one sample escapes and jumps between human hosts, searching for the best fit. It's a chilling sequence that sets the tone for a much darker story than what actually follows. In a jarringly clunky transition, the story jumps to Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy doing his idea of a New York accent) and his fiancé, Anne (Michelle Williams) living happily in San Francisco. Hardy goes all in on playing the anxious, twitchy guy who is great at his job but is also kind of a loser and has the most peculiar gait. He walks the way someone would walk if you told them, ""hey, walk in the weirdest way possible, like in a way that no one would ever actually walk."" It's completely transfixing. Eddie's awkward walk aligns with his natural tendency to create awkward situations. He is a successful reporter who is known for pushing boundaries, so it's only too obvious what he will do when interviewing shady billionaire, Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), for what is supposed to be a puff piece. In another less-than-stellar transition, the timeline fast-forwards six months and shows Eddie's life in shambles. This might have been affecting if any of this felt earned, but certain essential scenes are absent and were likely trimmed in editing to put the final runtime under two hours. Choices like these give the entire film a rushed, erratic feel of something that had ideas but didn't know how to piece them together into a fluid story arc.Meanwhile, all this has happened and still Venom has yet to make an appearance. The movie spends too much time on nonessential plot points and takes too long to reach the most compelling and entertaining parts. In other words, the movie is called Venom, so put Venom in the movie. When Venom finally shows up, the movie finally has life. Sort of. Venom and Eddie exchange banter that occasionally delivers winning punchlines, a few of which caused outbursts of laughter throughout the theater. That's great. The problem is the dozens of other jokes that were met with crickets or confusion. This might be due to Venom's abrupt language advancements. He quickly evolves from monosyllabic commands of ""food!"" to offering insightful romantic advice. It's another case of unearned plot and character development. But the worst parts of the movie are the incomprehensible and nearly unwatchable action sequences that didn't follow any discernable rules of continuity or visual logic. I didn't know where to look and half the time I didn't even know what I was looking at. That's the downside of fight scenes that rely too heavily on CGI. The climactic fight scene involves a bizarre swirling tornado of Venom and another blob monster that is meant to resemble a warrior-like battle, but the comically wide-open mouths and tongue swinging turns the display into something that looks more like a sloppy teenage make out session.It's a dumb scene in a dumb movie that never quite figures itself out. Marvel has made many great movies over the past 10 years. Venom is not one of them.",Venom
250,cgearheart,Relentlessly disappointing,3,16 April 2019,"Rather than a high octane, blood-fueled actioner about a sadistic alien anti-hero, we were treated to this steaming pile of garbage that played more like a bizarre and sheepish comedy than a sci-fi movie.Tom Hardy hits all the high notes as the voice of Venom but bumbles around as Eddie, doing his very worst to hide his British accent. Riz Ahmed tries hard but can't deny that his character is absolutely ridiculous and has no logic to back him up. Lastly, Michelle Williams phones in what could possibly be the worst performance in her entire career. A pile of wet cardboard covered in gravel could act circles around this typically amazing actress in this circumstance. As soon as the movie gets good and we're finally introduced to Venom and the first fight between Venom and Riot, the movie immediately ends..The filmmakers then tried to make up for the lousy ending with a ""last minute"" end credit scene where we're introduced to Woody Harrelson wearing a Ronald McDonald wig and sporting a southern accent, apparently to tease the character Carnage. Then to try to make up for that lazy and sad excuse of end credit crap, the filmmakers also decided to throw in an EXTRA end credit scene that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie: a random and completely out of context scene from ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"".Venom is quite possibly one of the worst ""superhero"" movies I've seen. It's one of that had me feel genuinely robbed of a good opportunity.D-",Venom
251,L_Copa,WE ARE .... Satisfied!,7,14 December 2018,"I mean what more did you want guys?

Tom Hardy was excellent in his role and we had a couple of laughs with Stan Lee and we saw a spoil of Carnage. it was a great start and it can be even better with Spidy and Carnage in the next one! Directing was fine.",Venom
252,sirwillisiv,Just run-of-the-mill bad...,4,7 October 2018,"Venom is one of the more iconic Marvel villains to not receive good film treatment. His character was severely miswritten and miscast in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3, and he never even got a chance in Marc Webb's short-lived series. This really left Marvel fans with a sour aftertaste. Sadly, this aftertaste persists with this recent standalone film. Venom is neither great, or terrible, it's just run-of-the-mill bad, and accurately represents its abysmal 30% on Rotten Tomatoes. If you watched the trailer, you pretty much saw the whole movie. You're not missing much.This film suffers from some painful writing and blatant misdirection. I don't think the writers and Fleischer understood the characters of Brock and Venom at all. Brock is an ambitious, embittered bully, while Venom represents the merciless beast that Brock himself isn't strong enough to become. The film takes the formulaic route by having Brock portrayed as a good-hearted, yet gruff eccentric who is reluctant to follow Venom's guidance and in the end wants to show the symbiote how to use his otherworldly abilities for good. I don't blame Tom Hardy for this, his performance was objectively decent, it was the writers not getting the kind of characters Brock and Venom are supposed to be. They're just violent monsters with deep, dark grudges, it's pretty simple. Hearing Venom say ""I was a loser on my own planet"", childishly point out what nearby person or animal he wants to eat, and overall possess a heroic conscious on any kind was extremely out-of-character.That being said, I did find the sequences where Venom was at his prime to be very badass. It's just a relief after all these years to see a larger-than-life, genuinely intimidating portrayal of the character on the big screen. The CGI looks and even sounds marvelous, from the way Venom squirms to the squishy noises he makes. T-1000 level. A lot of care was put into the visual and sound design for Venom himself, and that's something I walked out satisfied with. However, the action sequences did have some issues. First of all, I heard a Wilhelm scream. This is personal, but historic as it may be, I hate that sound effect to death. It punctuates the scene and its tone. It's not funny, you're not being clever. Sound designers, stop being hacks. Secondly, I found some of the editing to be a mess. Too many fast-cut, close-ups mashed together incoherently, it made it difficult to understand what was going on at times. Thirdly, the set-pieces are just LOUD; Borderline Michael Bay-territory. I realize a lot is happening and suspense is building, but it was just...mindnumbing. I more enjoyed the scenes where Venom was shapeshifting rapidly and slaughtering his foes, even biting some people's heads off, but being that the film is PG-13, the end results were censored with quick cutaway shots. I did hear that 40 minutes of the film were cut, most of them being Tom Hardy's favorite scenes, and that already didn't bode well prior to the film's release. Were they the more gratuitously violent scenes that would've pushed an R rating? Perhaps we'll see a director's cut on home video, but I think the theatrical version could've taken more risks. Deadpool did, and look how much of a critical and commercial success both films are.What else is there to talk about? The story and characters? I already mentioned that Eddie Brock isn't exactly portrayed right despite Tom Hardy giving his all. The villain is very stock and uninvesting; just a temperamental business head going to extreme lengths to get what he wants. The love interest, aside from one surprising scene between her and Venom, is a total waste of talent on Oscar-nominee Michelle Williams' part. The love interest's new boyfriend? Oh jeez, what movie DOESN'T have that character. Dull as a 2x4 plank of wood. The more talky moments between these characters are simply tedious, plagued by some rather achingly forced dialogue. Some of the things these characters say to eachother are just plain absurd, and I'm almost certain that the most insane lunatic on this planet would even feel offset by their interactions. Bottom line: The characters are hackneyed, boring, and stupidly written, and they serve very little to an already familiar narrative structure of ""underdog takes on big bad corporation.""To summarize, Venom's not a good flick. It's loud, cheaply written, often slow and joyless, but the sequences with Venom doing his thing has its moments of awe, despite some messy editing. If only the film had better direction and a more concrete script that served the characters justice. An after-credits scene featured another well-regarded Marvel villain played by an acclaimed actor in the industry, showing some promise for the film's future, but like I said earlier: If you watched the trailer, you pretty much saw the whole movie. I'm sure it'll become a cult hit for action junkies, but I'd personally place Venom in the Ghost Rider tier of mediocre Marvel movies.",Venom
253,coasterdude44,Tom Hardy is AWESOME as Eddie Brock in Venom,8,30 December 2019,"I don't get what critics are saying about Venom that's really getting them in a twist over this movie. Tom Hardy played a brilliant performace as Brock which was entertaining, believable and most of all relateable. It was a huge improvement over his deadpan performance in Fury Road and was far more detailed and human this time around. the CGI for Venom himself is also very well done and incredibly kenetic and full of personality. It's also a very good looking movie style wise and very sharply directed with some very well paced scenes and some very well edited action sequences. The bike chase scene was so much fun and really ramped up the wow factor for me as the movie continues to entertain as it goes onThe fusion of Venom with Brock is very entertaining with some really good humor and writing for Venom with so many good quips and personality quirks coming from him. It's a shame it's not part of the official MCU because this is how you do a superhero origin story and make it entertaining. It's a vast improvement over the Spider-Man 3 verson which was very simple and shallow by comparison. This on the other hand was smart, sharp and extremely satisfying with interesting story and characters. I am impressed with what they did with it and I'm excited for the sequel",Venom
254,scb_coldsteel,"Mindless poorly-written fun, Venom deserved better.",6,5 October 2018,"So I saw the new movie Venom last night at the theater. I will admit I walked into this movie wanting to love it. I'm a huge Tom Hardy fan and Venom has always been one of the coolest Spider-Man villains. I really wanted this to redeem the Sam Raimi version of Venom from Spider-Man 3. Unfortunately this movie was all around a mixed bag.One of the biggest problems of the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be. The film blends together romance, gory action, and the comedy together but never really finds Its voice. The film felt disjointed with the comedy completely out of place for the tone of the film. Not every superhero movie needs to try to add humor. The poor humor and romance subplot also slowed down the dark violent action that should have been the centerpiece of the Venom movie. There is no reason this movie should not have been rated R.The film's central plot was also formulaic and rushed together. There was not a single Innovative idea in the entire movie. There was a cookie cutter villain, a predictable love triangle, and a cliche plot conflict. The entire plot progression just felt forced. There just wasn't anything compelling in the story that made me get involved with the story.The film also did not feel like a Venom movie to me. It seemed as if they used the name Eddie Brock and Venom, but beyond that nothing else represented the characters I know. They made an odd choice to try to make the Symbiote a comic relief, which never worked well in the film. I'm fine with changing the source material like in Logan, but at least keep true to the spirit of the characters.Now as far as things the movie did well Tom Hardy is always a great actor. The material he was working with may not have been the best but he still delivered it well. He was all around a likeable protagonist worth rooting for.When the film finally got around to utilizing the Venom symbiote it was a lot of fun. The inner thirteen-year-old in me had a blast watching Venom literally bite the head off of people. The fight scenes were also fast-paced and well done. The cgi and animation were all around pure eye candy. Venom just being allowed to be Venom was the best part of the movie. I just wish there was more of it.There should have been substantially more of Venom being the dark and minesing anti-hero that he is. Unfortunately the film didn't have a clear idea of what it wanted to be. The film was all over the place, the central conflict was weak, and it wasn't dark enough for the source material. Overall it was a relatively dumb movie with a few fun moments peppered throughout. It certainly had its mindless fun moments, but the movie is a drastic drop in quality compared to a Disney Marvel film. A 6 out of 10.",Venom

The story is not that bad, average acting, great special effect, and fast pace. They're some comedy in the scene but it's just a little but when I was watch the movie, I notice they're only two simularities from Spider-Man 3 but except he didn't fake a picture, he try to ask some question that we're not suppose to be ask and he got fired and he was depressed because of that untill he found the symbiote.

I didn't think it was a great idea coming up with a Venom solo movie and didn't have any expectations on this, but it still disappointed me.
The move is an alien invasion movie with the character's name on it and some similarities, but nothing to do really...
Not only is not faithful to the comic (which I don't mind really) but it has stupid characters, ridiculous situations, bad acting, silly story, cliches... it has it all ...to be a mess!!
I'm only giving it this rating because of the final fight scene, it's the only decent scene in the movie, even if it's not even anything new or great.

Big fan of Tom Hardy also. So there is no ulterior motive in my review. I wanted to like this movie but there were few redeeming features. The only one really was Venom himself. The CGI was awful but only scored well when Venom was on screen. They did him well. Otherwise awful CGI, awful action sequences, awful plot, awful dialogue and awful acting. Hardy must have been desperate for a paycheck. I really think he was miscast. I found his character annoying. The whole point was that he was supposed to be a loser but he is good looking with a great job and hot girlfriend. Not much of a loser really. They needed to cast a geeky guy really.

I would be lying if I didn't want Spider-Man to come into the picture at some point down the road, and hopefully within the MCU.This was definitely an improvement and much better casting than the previous live action Venom in 'Spider-Man 3'. Yes, it would have been better had it been rated R. Venom is just better as a no mercy anti-hero with gory finishes.

In the end, we were both very shocked at how much we enjoyed this. First off, I really liked Tom Hardy. He carried this movie very well. I can somewhat relate to this character too which is also a plus. When Venom finally turns up, he had an awesome voice, a cool presence and even some funny banter between him and Tom Hardy, especially the elevator scene. The action scenes were very well done, and the movie never lets up to leave you bored. I had to use the bathroom the entire movie but couldn't find a spot to go.It doesn't mean the film isn't without its problems. Some of the dialogue was a little cheesy, Venom's motives were a little dumb and even his origin story is a head-scratcher, and even the bad guys taking our hero into the woods when they could have shot him in the lab didn't make sense either. I also thought the climax was a little cheesy and reminded me a bit of how Wonder Woman's final confrontation was.However, I thoroughly enjoyed Venom and glad I went to see it. I'm looking forward to the sequel too. This is just another example of critics not being paid off by Sony, so they decided to bash this movie. Critics need to find other work.",Venom

267,MamadNobari97,Finally Watched It,4,28 September 2021,"Never wanted to watch it but decided to do it anyway cuz the second one might be good and they'd connect it to MCU.But the movie is really bad, the name of the movie is Venom but it takes 1 hour till we see Venom. And don't think that anything good happens in that 1 hours, oh no, not even a shred of characterization.Action scenes are decent and Venom's design is cool and all, but that's the only thing I can say about this movie, there's no substance or a good plot here, and the writing is abhorrent.The villain is most generic thing you can imagine with the worst and most laughable dialogue ever.This movie could've been a great antihero movie with some gore and violence but Eddy and Venom just joke and fool around.This had the potential to be a breath of fresh air in the midst of all these Marvel and DC movies with good guys as protagonists who always joke and are light-hearted, and become something like Deadpool 2016, or what The Punisher was. But no! You HAVE TO make your protagonist a ""good guy"" even though he has a hungry man-eating symbiote inside him. You have to make him a ""fun"" character by making him joke with Venom all the time, because that's what makes the kids buy our toys apparently, because god forbid if we made our protagonist an anti-hero for once and not cringeworthingly copying Spider-Man.What's the difference between this movie's Venom and Spider-Man again? Ah yeah, that's right, he occasionally eats heads of people off-screen.Venom also says that he knows everything Eddy knows cuz he's in his head and body, which makes sense, but literally asks who Anny is the next scene. What?Character motivations are really confusing and dumb, Venom tells Eddy to get ready for his world to be dominated by symbiotes and then in the next scene he has a change of heart and is a good little symbiote boi just like that, and he says that Eddy changed him. Can someone tell what exactly Eddy did that made Venom not want to eat people anymore and become a good guy all of a sudden? Yeah, you can't.Even at the end of the movie I didn't care about any of the characters as the characterization and character development is abysmal in this movie.It's been for how long these companies have been making movies? And they still don't care about hiring good writers? You're paying 100 million for the movie and not for once it occurs to you that maybe it's not a bad idea to invest in good writing instead of just CGI monsters fighting each other?",Venom

269,MinistryofDoom,The Venom we always wanted!,9,18 March 2019,"OK, you can now officially forget that Sam Raimi's Venom in Spiderman 3 existed. Sony rebooted Spiderman so many times that it's only natural for them to finally reboot that one sore spot left unattended: Venom. He is no longer remembered as black Spiderman with teeth played by the adequate Topher Grace. Rather, he will be remembered as was always intended: the gigantic musclebound black slimey creature with huge teeth that likes to snack on humans.Comic book nerds, rejoice! This is our Venom! For all of you that recalled Marvel's ""homecoming"" storyline post-Secret Wars, or remember reading and collecting Todd McFarlane's run on Amazing Spiderman, this is your Venom. This is what you've always wanted. Well, this film does not disappoint. While the film barely scratches the surface on the Venom origin and story, it sets up a good beginning that leaves us questioning if and how it will connect to the Sony Spiderman films (not even mentioning the connection that those films have to the Marvel Cinematic Universe but let's not get ahead of ourselves). Could there one day be a Tom Holland/Tom Hardy cross-over? Here's hoping, true believers!Overall, the story is a great, if a little rushed. If you recall the Venom comic book mini-series where he goes to San Francisco, becomes an Anti-Hero, and gets hunted by a nefarious tech company....that's this film in a nutshell. However, without giving too much away, it definitely makes some necessary changes in the adaptation to keep things exciting on the big screen. Let's make one thing perfectly clear though. This is not a child friendly film. There are no cutesy super hero origin stories here. No great powers with great responsibility memes. The world in which this film exists is cold, dark, gritty, and most definitely cruel. In this Venom film, people can, and will, exploit the innocent to achieve power. That is, ironically, one of the things that Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock, a no nonsense crack-shot investigative journalist, seeks to expose and ultimately to what he falls victim.Tom Hardy exudes his usual bravado and tough guy swagger, which works well because that's what Eddie Brock is all about. My only issue is that I would have liked to see a more involved role for the beautiful and ever graceful Michelle Williams. Her character is the string that keeps Eddie Brock's humanity intact so that the monster inside does not consume him, and yet she's also tragic in her own right. A little more screen time and some further development of her character would have been great.",Venom

Tom Hardy as Eddy, aka, Venom is, for me the saviour of this film, as the rest of the cast are just cut and paste of characters we have already seen in other comic book films. No one stands out, but Hardy. The plot is pretty interesting, but is executed in a very goofy fashion. The pacing, however, was quick and witted, which, at least made the time go quicker. But I really wanted this film to be more dark and horrfying. Even though it's rated R, it feels like a PG 13 film, heck, eveb a standard PG at times. I am looking forward to Sony's future projects, but for me, this is one I mat not re-watch.",Venom

So what there is no A list actor other than Tom Hardy in the Venom movie.
So what it lacks the Marvel family fun touch.
So what if critics have shot it down so far.Tom Hardy's Venom does not touch the highs of say Black Panther or Iron Man when it comes to comic book origin stories, but it sure is fun, a lot more fun than most DC movies, a little less than Marvel flicks. After long last here is a comic book film that behaves like what it is, and not try to change the world. 
Dr. Carlton Drake - ""Look around at the world. What do you see? A planet on the brink of collapse. Human beings are disposable. But man and symbiote combined, this is a new race, a new species... a higher lifeform""Sure enough. Venom starts off as science fiction. New species found that requires a suitable host, and one that is sought after by an evil genius. Enter investigative reporter Eddie Brock who is found to be the suitable host for the above symbiotic species and voila, we have Venom. Brock has teething problems (no pun intended) to start with, but once they bond, the movie shifts several gears at one go, and at the end, you are left asking for more. Most of the movie, Brock-Venom is not a superhero, but bent on self preservation. Towards the end Venom realizes he is also a loser like Brock, and then accepts the earth saving duties. Venom - ""We will eat both of your arms, and then both of your legs, and then we will eat your face right off your head. You will be this armless, legless, faceless thing, won't you, going down the street like a turd in the wind!"" Venom is an action horror comedy, and had it got the R rating that it should have gone for, it might just have been THE R rated movie of the year. Hardy has gone on record to say that the 40 minutes edited out of the final cut were his favorite parts, you know, the unhinged stuff that you want to see in a Venom movie.Director Ruben Fleischer does a good job of maintaining an even tempo throughout the movie, and i liked the fact that for once, a movie is just about the central character. But clearly the star is Tom Hardy, who removes the bane (again no pun intended) of Eddie Brock 2007. Eddie Brock is Spiderman 3 was an idiot, Eddie Brock in 2018 Venom is a hopeless romantic hero who manages to make a protector out of a symbiote who has a thing for biting off people's heads. Hardy plays Brock as witty, and charming, and as Venom, he is menacing.Venom - ""Eyes! Lungs! Pancreas! So many snacks, so little time!"" 
Now give us the Spiderman- Venom crossover we deserve, along with Carnage for added fun.Ah, Venom was fun, but cannot help wonder how much more fun it would have been if not for the ratings.....7/10",Venom
272,Semisonic,"Venom, a giant talking snot",6,24 January 2019,"I'm sure the comic book connoisseurs are able to distinguish dozens of tiniest intonations and emotions in those painted magazines. For a layman like myself though, comics look overly hyperbolized and specifically crafted to entertain the simple tastes of a younger reader.Well, in this case Venom is a prime example of a comic book movie. The subtlety is nonexistent, everything is flashy and everyone a screaming archetype - of a reckless rebel, a girl next door with a sensitive soul, an unscrupulous tycoon, a scientist who suddenly grew a conscience, and of a dozen other typical comic story residents. Even the slapstick action, cheesy dialogs and horrendous overacting, so different from the ""serious"" mainstream Marvel movies, are absolutely natural for the American manga twins.So, in a sense, Venom is a very authentic example of a film made by the canons of the comic books. And it's also an example of why those canons don't work for anything destined for a screen and not paper. Because, unless you're trying to make a Looney Tunes ripoff, you need a more evenly paced approach, and even in the B-movies these days audience expects to see at least some substance. And no, generic CGI of intertwined colored phlegm and mature actresses running around in mini skirts are not the substance I mean.Come think of it, the after-credits toon puts everything into place. Venom would be just perfect... if only it was drawn and not filmed. Unfortunately, the likes of Stan Lee are too few these days, and they had to make due with what Hollywood could spare. What a shame.",Venom
273,daniellawson-14-787057,Script and Special Effects Both Seemed Unfinished,5,12 October 2021,"POSITIVES:1) Tom Hardy is a brilliant actor and is able to bring quality to any film he is in. The fact he also provides the voice of Venom as well as playing Eddie is cool
2) Riz Ahmed also did well as the villain I thought - as good as he could with the script he was given anyway
3) The more mysterious & intriguing elements of the film were when it worked best for me - especially during the first half when Drake is doing his testing of the symbiotesNEGATIVES:1) The script is awful at times. Some of the dialogue Riz Ahmed is forced to deliver when explaining he wants to merge humans and symbiotes was honestly painful to listen to. There are also so many elements of the script that feel lazy and rushed over - E.g. The reason Venom decides to betray his own kind is just because he kinda likes Eddie after being inside him for what feels like only a few hours
2) Some of the special effects are honestly the worst special effects I have since a film in the past decade. Particularly miserable standouts are the scene in which Drake does the symbiote testing on Isaac and the scene in which Eddie gets trapped in Dan's lab and has the high pitched sounds drive Venom out of his body
3) The conclusion to the final battle makes no sense to me. Venom cuts down the rocket a little bit and then Riot and Drake immediately blow up and die?? Would the little cut that Venom does really cause the entire rocket to blow up straight away? Even so, would Riot not be able to survive that?",Venom
274,BrickNash,A great slice of likeable entertainment!,8,8 October 2018,"This is a highly enjoyable romp with quite a likeable anti-hero. Tom Hardy is both engaging and hilarious as both Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom, and the two and fro between the two characters is what really makes the film work.As a film though, it's fine, but relatively unspectacular. It follows a reasonably generic Marvel-style pattern which guarantees it's head is kept above water, but it also means that there is a little case of ""Seen it before"" happening. The script could be better and the CGI is pretty terrible and looks more like late 90s tier computer images.However the Venom personality, while essentially evil, becomes incredibly endearing towards the end of the film, and as such and ropy effects or script blandness were made redundant, plus I was left hoping for a sequel.If they can get a better script with sharper banter between Brock and Venom and have the film a bit less generic in structure then this could be a fantastic franchise all on its own. No Spider-Man required!All in all, a great start and a very entertaining film which has it where it counts.Recommended!",Venom
275,EddyTheMartian007,"Venom is painfully mediocre, but there's some enjoyment to it.",4,21 December 2018,"(Possible Minor Spoilers)The movie is just fine. It's an enjoyable movie, but it's never more than that. There isn't really any depth, not even good or thought provoking lines.Starting with the more technical aspects, the effects were alright. There were a few parts where it looked kinda bad, but for the most part it was good enough. The Music from Ludwig Goransson was actually pretty good. There were some nice shots, and some pretty good cinematography at moments, but it I was a little disappointed there weren't any horror elements.One of the bigger issues with the film is most of the writing is bad. It's really basic, some lines are really weird, and some are just very bad. The writing feels extremely rushed. There's some jokes, most of them don't land, there's only like 2 moments that made me laugh,
and a few more which made me grin. The movie wasn't even that funny.Another issue I have with the movie is the villains. The villains are just so boring. Riz Ahmed does an ok job, but he isn't really given any material to be better. The Life foundation is just boring. The Symbiote Riot's motivation is really silly too.Another issue I had (not that big) was Michelle Williams' Character. She was just the average CBM love interest. There wasn't anything to her, also she seems to appear everywhere where she's needed. There's another unimportant character which just manages to appear In a highly secured location with no explanation. Also Eddie and her have no chemistry.Basically the only good characters are definitely Venom and Eddie Brock, played by the great Tom Hardy. Their chemistry was really good, and fun to watch, but I felt like their friendship developed too quick. It also brought for some pretty entertaining moments when venom spoke to Eddie in his head. I didn't think Venom's motivation for betraying the symbiotes was justified enough though. Also the characters have no arc, except maybe learning to accept Venom.The story was basic, and the ending felt kinda rushed. It was reported there were 40 minutes cut of the film, and it does feel like it honestly. The pacing is bad since when Eddie and Venom aren't on screen it's honestly boring and uninteresting. Most of the characters for some reason don't freak out with Venom. I found that very odd, I mean it's a huge black slime alien thing eating people, and they just accept it.The 1st act dragged. It was pretty slow and exposition heavy, but I did think Eddie's set up was actually done pretty well, everything else wasn't though. I'd say the second act was probably the strongest. It had the 2 best action sequences. It had a pretty cool chase sequence. It wasn't anything to special, but it was pretty cool.Also apparently the life foundation is rich enough to have drones that travel as fast as cars, and literally kamikaze onto Eddie to attack. Like they just wasted so many drones. Couldn't the drones have weapons? There's some silly stuff like that in the movie.Also the main plot being the Life Foundation literally having a space ship, traveling to a comet, getting aliens, and crash landing back on earth? Then there was the fight against the swat team which had some really cool parts. Especially when Venom is in the smoke and starts grabbing everyone and uses one of the guys as a weapon.The third act felt really rushed though, it kinda came out of no where and it was just a big cgi fight that wasn't really any good. Also it was just silly, and it wasn't very enjoyable. The third act is definitely the weakest, but it was also really quick.There's a few other issues I had, like a character dying and literally never being brought up again. Also Venom says a lot of stuff which get contradicted later. It's set up in the film that when a symbiote leaves their host, they usually die if they aren't a perfect match, but this happens to one of the characters,
and they survive.Also also Eddie doesn't want to kill good people, but he brutally murders an innocent swat team.Finally one of the biggest issues is 2 characters seemingly die and get miraculously saved even though it makes no sense they'd survive. Basically this movie had a lot of problems too.Overall though, I did enjoy myself, but it wasn't a good movie. It's the type of movie you just turn your brain off and enjoy. I don't even think it's worth going to the theatre to watch it. I'd probably wait till you can rent it or something, it isn't even worth it. Even though my (extremely bad) exceptions were exceeded, I still left out disappointed at what could've been. I wish this movie took the horror route and the R-Rating. The R-Rating in this version of the movie wouldn't have done much. Venom only eats like 3 people and it's off camera, and there isn't even blood in the movie. I just felt like the movie should've gone a horror route, and been more violent. It could've given us something different and something genuinely good.In Conclusion Venom was a mediocre movie. It was Enjoyable, but it just felt unimportant. Most of the characters are uninteresting, a lot of the movie is boring, there's really bad writing at points, and there's a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies, which some could have been easily fixed.Overall while I did enjoy this movie, it's not good, it's honestly painfully average, and it has a lot of issues which overall make the movie kinda bad.4.5/10",Venom

Most of the action sequences are good, the performances are convincing, some special effects do not work at all but most are good, the CGI is good, one negative thing is the ease with things are solved, but despite that, it is a good action movie with a compelling script.",Venom
280,polednick,Somewhat entertaining,4,31 July 2021,The first half of the movie was interesting. But after the transformation into Venom it was laughable....only that I couldn't find something to laugh.I don't know if this movie stays true to the comic ... but I also don't care about that.Nice CGI effects...but a story that is so unbelievable.So the 4 points are for the first part....the rest I would give a negative voting.,Venom
281,bastille-852-731547,Terrible Supervillain Origin Film,2,16 October 2018,"Despite poor reviews from critics, ""Venom"" is making quite a lot of money at the box office right now. Maybe it's because of the popularity of the character, or maybe even the fact that some casual audiences may (incorrectly) believe it is part of the MCU. I didn't think it looked very good and was not planning to see it in theaters originally, and only went to see it because of an online ticketing coupon which made it free. That said, I went in optimistic, as there have been some films this year that looked unappealing yet I ended up finding them enjoyable (e.g. ""The Spy Who Dumped Me."") But despite my optimistic sentiment, ""Venom"" was not just bad, it was really bad.I like Tom Hardy as an actor, but his acting is incredibly weak here. He is not really given much of a range to work with, which isn't necessarily his fault, but his portrayal of Eddie Brock is wholly unconvincing. The film's ""origin story"" tropes are rather tired, but that's nothing compared to the film's atrocious script. The script for this film is one of the worst in recent memory, with unbelievably cheesy dialogue or very cliché dialogue (e.g. Brock saying ""what is wrong with me?"" after feeling sick, etc.) coming at the viewer in almost every scene. Additionally, the film's tonal mishaps give the film a major identity crisis. ""Venom"" can't decide whether it wants to be an action-comedy a la traditional Marvel movies or a sci-fi horror flick a la ""Alien."" The problem is that the movie struggles with both tones. The attempts at humor in the movie feel incredibly forced and unfunny. Despite some creepy images of body horror and one or two jump scares, the movie is not particularly scary either. As a result, the movie just feels like a mishmash that was thrown together. The only remotely decent thing about it is an engaging car chase scene about halfway through. Definitely not recommended. 2/10",Venom
282,phoenixinvictus,Cannibalism is not cool,3,17 March 2019,"The message that I got from this movie is that is okay to be a cannibal so long as you only eat ""gang members"" and ""bad people"". If you kill an undercover cop or a confidential informant then it's ""my bad"". It's not like Venom is a superhero or even an antihero, because Venom is a symbiote that demands for a perfect match to connect with its host or otherwise the host dies. The whole movie is a cliché of the superhero genre. We have the ""Evil"" CEO of a corporation who is using his space ships to salvage extraterrestrial organisms that he professes will be beneficial to mankind and ends up experimenting on homeless people. So we have a double whammy of ""Evil"" CEO and ""Mad Scientist"". The CGI was predictably bad as is with most movies of this genre. The script is clunky at best, and Venom's incentive to ""protect Earth and humanity"" are about as complex and fleshed out as a hardboiled egg (and I hate boiled eggs). However, and to be fair, it does have its funny moments but the first part of the movie is dull.",Venom

284,eelen-seth,Fun!!!,6,4 October 2018,"'Venom' is a lot of fun. It might not be great, but it made me smile and root for its titular character throughout the movie. 
Watching Tom Hardy's 'Eddie Brock' interact with his parasite is hilarious. It might not be any of the actors' best work, but that's not a bad thing. Especially Michelle Williams' character is written paper thin. 
As for the special effects, they were actually not that bad. After the trailers, I guess they must've polished them a bit more?! It's a comic book movie that fans will appreciate. And there's also two cameo's, one you'll expect by now and the other during a mid credit scene.
I've watched this in 4Dx with colleagues and can highly recommend watching it this way! (If your local cinema has a 4Dx cinema, that is)Bring on 'Venom 2' I'd say 😈",Venom
285,aliases-53334,Entertaining but missing something,7,12 October 2018,"The film is enjoyable to watch in the cinema, alot of laughs and goofs. However, as the film unfolds it is a bit too obvious that Venom lacks an obvious development in characters and a boring all-male cast that insists still on casting a fantastic actress suh as Michelle Williams as the ""girlfriend"", a miscast that made me cringe, and a lack of other interesting female roles. Dear Hollywood, women are more than 50% of the population, and we are bored with all-male lead films. To your attention! 
Besides that, there is alot of action and special effects. It is indeed a bit childish, but sill fun and games. Go see but leave expectations at home.",Venom
286,torrascotia,Ignore the negative reviews.,6,5 October 2018,"This is a decent action comic book movie.
This is your basic superhero with CGI and explosions action movie with a hero vs villain storyline with a love interest on the side. 
The tone of the movie is however best suited for a teenage audience due to some of the violence and language used, its not a PG movie but certainly not as extreme as Deadpool. 
What this isn't however is a massively funded blockbuster such as Infinity Wars, its more on the level of Spiderman or the AntMan movies. Which is not a bad thing, this is a nice 90 min movie, no two or three hour snoozefest which spends too much time on backstory...
Tom Hardy is well versed in playing crazy characters as anyone who has seen Bronson can attest. Unlike his role in the Batman movies his acting skills aren't being blunted by a mask so in this role we get to see him go full on Tom Hardy. And it works. 
The action scenes are also good and the CGI doesn't look bad either. I have no idea what some critics expect but it could be that after Infinity that people are simply spoiled and now expect that to be the current standard for all superhero movies from now on. It simply cant be.
So who exactly doesn't like the movie? Professional critics, comic fans who maybe have a different idea in their mind how the character should be and Lady Ga Ga fans out to promote her movie at the expense of others? For everyone else just after some action, humour and excitement this is worth your time and money. Looking forward to any sequels as long as they keep Tom Hardy.",Venom

This movie is pure cinematic fun. It is great. It is fast, interesting,funny.Great fight scenes. The only thing that can't make it a 10/10 movie is that there is not anything really really special about it. The plot has been played again and again in other movies. Not exactly the same, but there are common things with other superhero movies. But the great thing about this movie is that it doesn't pretend it is a serious movie. It is an action comedy and people like me who like this kind of movies will be fully satisfied with what they have watched. Don't expect a masterpiece. Expect a movie that is fast,funny and interesting. Plus I believe that Tom Hardy was an excellent selection for this movie.",Venom

It's just so good.It's basically about a guy called Eddie Brock (hardy) a reporter of the kind that outs wrong doing and he stumbles into a company run by a Carlton Drake played by Roz Ahmed and he has managed to acquire an alien being of sorts in the shape of a black gooey entity from outer space.Eddie somehow gets access to the laboratory and somehow this is where he consumes but not through choice Venom. The fun begins and by fun I mean it's hilarious. Venom and Eddie have this funny dialogue between them and it's just so funny.It's action packed, adventurous, funny, filled with effects and gripping as Eddie with the help of Venom sets about stopping Carlton Brock from creating the ultimate weapon.With a budget of $100,000,000 You kinda see why when you watch this hilarious and at the same time action packed sci-fi for yourself...well worth the 10/10 I gave it",Venom
289,a.lampert,Funny & entertaining monster movie,7,18 October 2021,"Don't watch Venom if you're looking for either a horror or a superhero movie although it's a Marvel addition. I say that as a viewer who just wants to be entertained and doesn't take all this superhero stuff seriously. I don't care if they diverge from the comics that inspired them, just that it be entertaining and Venom is. Riz Ahmed is the cold blooded rich guy experimenting with alien life forms that infect our hero, Tom Hardy and give him super powers. These movies have become boring now with their relentless special effects but Venom is mostly spared that with a great performance from a rumpled Hardy as a investigative reporter who gets fired for trying to expose Ahmed and his creepy scientific experiments. The humour starts to build and instead of the movie trying to take itself seriously like so many other superhero movies, it plays to the strength of that humour and I found myself chuckling more and more. If you accept it as a comedy, the leads, Hardy and the lovely Michelle Williams are very endearing and have great chemistry, rather like Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in Spiderman. Enjoy.",Venom

Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed also do well in their respective roles, despite being giving little to do in the script. The action is also quite interesting, and despite the rushed fight in the end, it's very well done and you feel energized after going through it.

294,justinwfirestone,Not as bad as anticipated,5,21 March 2019,"Venom's weakness is not that it's a bad movie. It's not a good movie. It's not a bad movie. It's a movie and it's not as bad as Others would have you Believe. Tom Hardy (that is Tom Hardy running around doing stuff in the movie, right?), likes tater tots, and thankfully, so does Venom.Venom's weaknesses are dog whistles and the occasional desire for deep mouth kisses (or is it deep-mouth kisses?). Venom's other weaknesses are that the animations are lame and whatever plot there might be gets lost in the complete absence of Spider-Man. It's ultimately for the best that the thin plot easily dissolves away for exciting zooms and slow-motion explosions, some of which also involve motorcycles and the streets of San Francisco.Without having read any of the source material, Venom is really strong, talks like Tom Hardy wearing a Bane mask, is persistently hungry, and has an uncanny knack for sensing quiet love. Venom moves fast, talks slow, and has separation issues. Oh, and there are other aliens that are like Venom who live on Venom World, but they are not as nice as Venom. Add that all up and the final lesson is that we are all our own worst enemies, both personally and in the more general sense.Check your brain at the door until there ain't no more Venom!",Venom
295,samyoung-82648,"For the 1000th time, ignore the main stream media",8,17 January 2019,"The media have told us we don't like this movie - It's confusing. It's a mess. It's incoherent. In truth, it's just more fake news from our media outlets. The main reason the media don't like the movie is because of the main cast member's skin color and sex.The story is entertaining, fun and thankfully, reasonably different from most of the super hero movies. It starts out with heavy political correctness, but it's not enough so satisfy the main stream media - let's face it, Tom Hardy isn't a total moron so the media would be outraged.The movie is as violent as many of the Avengers movies. Hardy's performance is solid (possibly making himself too passive to please the main stream media - which didn't work anyway). Williams is likeable, however, she's the chief lawyer, scientist and warrior rolled into one. Hollywood are afraid to have a female protagonist with the slightest of flaws. That's the rules of diversity (which have nothing to do with diversity) and it undermines Williams' credibility. It's not extreme enough to please the feminists and at the same time she is not credible to the other 90% of the population.I was tipped off about this film from on one reliable site where many people upvoted venom continually. When the main stream media tell us one thing and a large group of people say the opposite, you know there's a reason the media are burying this movie. Even if this type of movie is not your taste, looking beyond the media's reality distortion field is worth the price of admission to see why the media universally panned it.If the writers want to make a ""feminist compliant"" sequel, add a female venom. Make her 100x stronger, smarter, faster and intelligent than the male venom. Make the male venom highly stupid. Then throw in a line like ""you can't do that - you're a woman"". The guys won't watch it, but the media will praise it as unique, empowering (meaning like all of the other crap in the box office at the moment) and label it a box office smash.This film is definitely fresh. It's definitely worth the watch. I apologise to the main stream media for failing to toe the party line.",Venom
296,TheMovieDoctorful,Wow...It ACTUALLY Tried Something Different!,9,5 October 2018,"Wow...Something different...Something ACTUALLY different. No, Venom is no masterpiece. It's not perfect. It's not quite as great as I hoped it would be, but...It's ACTUALLY something different. And in an age where Marvel and DC give us the same comic book movie 500 times a year, that's incredibly high praise. Let me clarify; despite what you've been told, Venom is not a superhero movie. Venom is, at its heart, a horror comedy monster flick. It has much more in common in its characters, story, tone, comedy and action sequences with An American Werewolf in London or Evil Dead than, say, The Avengers or The Dark Knight. That's a wildly inventive and different take on the genre and enough to give it some much needed, genuine diversity.As I said, the film definitely has its problems. Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake is a terrible villain, one of the worst in recent comic book movie history. I'd like to say that he's better than most of the easily disposable MCU villains, but even compared to them, he's still low tier. Drake is your typical ""evil corporate bad guy"", but Ahmed is neither charismatic, over-the-top or intimidating enough to make it really work. The real shame is that the movie easily could have made him work as a perfect adversary for Hardy's Brock; a legally invulnerable, corrupt millionaire going up against an unlucky, lower class reporter with a chip on his shoulder. However, this dynamic is never really explored as much as it should be and, by the end of the day, his arc just ends in yet another case of 2 black CGI monsters smashing into each other.The neutered PG-13 rating also hurts the film significantly. To its credit, the film is surprisingly violent (To the point where my theater occasionally gasped) and there are moments of genuine suspense and terror here. However, at the end of the day, this is still the kind of movie where someone can get sliced in half with a blade arm and not leave a drop of blood. The edits are clear and blatant and I couldn't help but occasionally cringe at the obvious censor job Sony did to get the film at a more marketable PG-13. Here's hoping for an R-rated Director's Cut.I must say, Tom Hardy is perfect, as both Eddie Brock and Venom. As Eddie Brock, he's likable, goofy, charmingly dorky and incredibly sympathetic. As Venom, he's darkly hilarious, witty and commands an incredible screen presence. And his chemistry with Michelle Williams' Anne Weying (As both Venom and Eddie Brock) is off the charts. As somebody who frequently finds love stories in comic book films to be tepid and half hearted, this may be my favorite romance in a comic book film. It has its frequent adorable and sweet moments, but it isn't afraid to cover the more painful and stressful parts of their relationship either. It felt way more genuine to me than any other love story I've seen in a superhero movie. There's a scene in the 3rd act of the film involving Eddie, Michelle and the symbiote that is simultaneously sweepingly romantic, absolutely hilarious and incredibly bizarre. Without spoiling it, all I can say is that whether you love it or hate it, you won't forget that moment any time soon.Michelle Williams is fantastic in her own right too. She does an excellent job portraying Weying's spunk, confidence and intelligence and Williams brings both charisma and emotional vulnerability to the role. Weying herself is a surprisingly strong character as well; she's arguably even more proactive than Eddie is and I loved watching her arc from distant and condescending to more empathetic and compassionate. I've missed the days when love interests in comic book movies had genuine character arcs, so Williams' Weying was another breath of fresh air in a comic book movie already full of them.The comedy is definitely the highlight. This is by far the funniest comic book film I've seen to date, it puts both Deadpool movies to shame. It's very reminiscent of a John Landis or Sam Raimi horror comedy from the 80s. Complete insanity in the best way. There's a particular scene in a restaurant that had me laughing so hard my lungs hurt.As for the story, again, it's not particularly deep, but its clever in its own way, and has its admitted emotional moments regarding Anne and Eddie's relationship. The film works as a very interesting anti-Spider-Man movie; Eddie's irresponsibility is as essential to the character as Peter's responsibility and the movie tells a very compelling journey of a deeply self absorbed man having to learn to finally put the people around him above his own self interests when the chips are down. Even Eddie's relationship with his suit serves as a dark mirror to Spider-Man; in Homecoming, Peter has to learn that he doesn't need the suit to be a hero. In Venom, Eddie needs the friendship of his own suit to save the day.Venom is not the best comic book movie ever. It's not quite as great as I had hoped. But it's the farthest thing from bad. It has more heart and brains than critics are giving it credit for and it's a desperately needed original take on a genre that's admittedly been suffering from repetition, exhaustion and over-saturation. It's definitely more interesting, bold and rewatchable than 80% of the easily disposable and forgettable MCU films. It'll probably be more interesting, bold and rewatchable than any of the DCEU films post-Justice League (Including Justice League), which may as well be MCU-lite. I think I'm gonna go watch it again.(Also, very minor point, but that Eminem song was awful. It felt like a Vanilla Ice or MC Hammer song, only unironic and played completely straight. It was actually lowkey embarrassing to listen to.)",Venom

300,yashrajs536,Not upto the mark but still good.,7,7 October 2018,I will honestly admit that I was pretty much excited after watching the trailers of Venom. And I was waiting for this movie ever since.I was expecting some mind blowing action and I was not disappointed but still not satisfied though. The plot was simple. The performances of actors were average. Only Tom Hardy stood out and gave justice to the titular role. The movie was honestly bit boring in the initial 30 minutes. It was very much fast paced without establishing the characters of Eddie Brock or Karton Drake or Eddie's love interest Annie or of anyone. They just jumbled them into the story made a 15 minutes action sequence and shortly reached the climax. They could have made this movie a 2 hours long with the explaination of foundation of Venom and also establishing the characters in the film. But the film had its moments too. The action was not incredible but good. Tom Hardy made it a worth watch. Plus the jokes made by Venom were funny adding a light heart comedy into an otherwise serious movie. Overall I will give 6.5 stars out of 10.,Venom
301,jacksisjax,Venom The Relationship Therapist,4,7 July 2020,"Here are some things i like about this movie- Venom's voice is rather cool. Venom is fun to watch. Beautiful lighting.Here are some things i don't like- I don't think anyone performs well in this, except for maybe tom hardy. The CGI is just not good at all, from simple cars on a bridge CGI to main boss fight CG,I it all felt a bit off. The story is a mess! Confusing, weird and a rather rushed boss fight. The sets are stinky!Ther is just too much going on. All of a sudden a rocket is being launched. All of a sudden venom is now a lady, now lady venom is making out with eddie. Venom is killing Eddie! Now Eddie and venom are boys! Now venom is giving Eddie relationship advice! Awww venom is a loser on his planet just like Eddie!

Venom in this movie is not in the same villanous role as we normally see him, but rather an anti-hero and the dual personality-aspect is really emphazied in a great way.The tone of the movie is overall very fun, even in its darker moments, and the effects and action scenes are amazing. This is how Venom should look, the CG is glorious!The villain, played by Riz Ahmed, is a good anthises to Eddy Brock, and a sadisdic character even before his Riot transformation.Overall, it's a fun superhero (or maybe anti-hero?) flick with some great characters, action scenes and cinematography.

Character VENOM is created perfectly. The sound, the character, the bad and good about this antihero, everything is at it should be.If you look for a fun movie, with some laughs, plenty of action and fantasti special effects, this one will not let you down.Cast did a great job! Every single one of them.This is a movie that should not be rated based on profoundness. Its goal is not to be a drama or some cheesy cr*ap, but action packed, entertaingn fantasy.

This was a GREAT movie and I'm so glad that This movie wasn't dependent on Spiderman as far as his origin...although, to be honest...that IS how he came into being. I've read comics since I was a kid, but I digress. I LOVE the graphics in this movie, and the plot is on spot...even got the fact right about J.J Jameson's son being one of the astronauts on the mission that brought Venom to earth. It's amazing how much this blockbuster made! 100M Budget and it made 80M In it's opening WEEKEND! Homerun for Marvel...and by the way, over 800 M worldwide. BOOM!

310,paulijcalderon,"A fun character stuck in a generic plot. Not the best, but not the worst",6,8 October 2018,"Hey, I didn't expect to be so entertained by ""Venom"", but I would be lying if I said I wasn't. First thing to say is that the highlight throughout this ""symbiote"" film is Tom Hardy's performance combined with the fun design and personality of his newfound alien buddy. So Eddie Brock is our main character and our perfect host (as Venom himself would say). At first I was pretty OK with him being this ""hip"" reporter who rides motorcycles and isn't afraid to ask risky questions. However, there's a decision early on that changes his mentality. And that made a great impact because I found myself siding with him. Eddie quickly becomes a sad character who's trying to survive and make his life better. He's not a typical good guy or a bad guy. He's very nuanced in a way with his own faults and qualities. This made him believable and like a real human who ends up in the middle of some crazy stuff. I get the feeling they let Tom Hardy have lots of freedom to come up with any idea for the portrayal of Eddie. I wouldn't have minded to see a simple drama story instead. It would've been the life of a failed reporter working his through difficult/sad times in life. That could have made a more heartfelt movie, but we gotta have the comic book things here. It's ""Venom"" after all.Here's the thing, which I'm sure most people have been saying, but the relationship between Eddie and Venom is the heart of this otherwise thin plot. If it wasn't for them, you'd be watching a super generic action film about evil scientists and what not. I didn't end up caring for what was up with that corporation run by Riz Ahmed. And that guy is a good actor. In the end though he just becomes a cliche with no real personality left. The final action scenes were a mess. A bunch of CGI goo flying from on side to the other in shaky close-ups. Reframe that, guys. You don't have to get so close when the big alien guys are fighting. Use some more wides there, it's fine. Let the choreography do the job. Other than that the cinematography wasn't bad. It's coherent and follows the story nicely. It was just that ending fight that got frustrating and bland. Michelle Williams is always terrific, but underused here. I'm glad she actually signed on though. Her character manages to stand because she has the talent to make a character feel very much alive, and not a walking cardboard cut-out. Jenny Slate made an admirable effort, but again, her potential is quickly wasted. What also bugged me was this reference to Kryptonite. It confuses me because does that mean the DC comics exists within the Marvel world or something? Was it Ruben Fleischer letting the actors improvise? No idea, but a line was enough for me to start overthinking. And why, oh why did we not start with Carnage as the villain? It would have been much stronger. He's pretty much a psychopath and enough for Venom to understand where to draw the line of what's too much for an anti-hero. It's a villain that would be a deadly match and especially since he would strike fear and genuine tension. Riz Ahmed, you're great, but the villain here will easily be forgotten.I will end with a positive note, and it's that I laughed when I watched this movie. When Eddie starts hearing Venom's voice in his head things get brilliantly interesting. He goes completely insane at a point when he can't understand what's happening to him. I mean, there's another consciousness in your body who starts controlling you all the sudden. You would go crazy. Hardy plays the stress, the exhaustion and the general confusion so well. You wish the rest of the plot was as good as the effort in his performance. A scene I thought was perfect was when he interrupts his ex-love's dinner and proceeds to bathe in water filled with lobsters while eating them and yelling at the voice in his head. Oh, and he's also trying to convince people that a corporation is evil. I laughed quite a bit, it was really good. And you feel bad for Eddie, he's becoming an emotional wreck and it's near impossible to not wish he would get better. So there it is. Venom's character was funny, Tom Hardy's performance lifts the lazy script and you'll be amused by this wicked friendship. You'll be entrained, but you'll also wish the execution was more on par with what this concept deserves. Could've been better, could've been worse. A lot worse...",Venom
311,rcolgan,"Not a disaster, but not the best start to a new franchise",5,7 October 2018,"Sony may have finally agreed that the MCU can use Spider-man after failing to start up their Amazing Spider-man film series, but that doesn't mean that they can't keep milking their biggest cash cow in every way they can. Thus we get Venom, one of Spider-man's biggest enemies getting a new origin without Spider-man and a film franchise of his own. The end result is a strange mixture of dullness, weirdness and a few blushes of genuine fun scattered throughout. Set in San Francisco, the film stars Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, a journalist who is going after a man named Carlton (Riz Ahmed), a multi-billion dollar entrepreneur who is in on the verge of many breakthrough discoveries and is involved with several deaths. Whilst investigating one of his facilities, Eddie comes in to contact with one of the symbiotes that were brought to earth by one of Carlton's deep space discoveries. This symbiote then attaches itself to Eddie and creates Eddie's new personality called Venom.Probably the biggest disappointment for anyone who's a fan of the comics will be that they never showed how the symbiote corrupts its host through its power. Even Spider-man 3, in spite of having one of the worst dance sequences put to film, still showed how the symbiote blended with Peter and was able to corrupt anyone it came into contact with. But in this film Venom and Brock live mostly in harmony, with Venom never really trying to take over and never actually doing anything evil either. Venom does still try to engage in a few horror elements, with the overall plot of the film resembling a classic monster movie formula and Venom's gothic design feeling like it's been ripped right from the pages of the comics. However, this does often lead to the film being tonally confused, with something that should be horrifying like Venom taking over another character and making them kill other humans for the first time is played up for laughs. Despite several moments clearly being cut out of the film, mostly as a result of Sony cutting out several darker moments to avoid an R rating, Venom does have a few creative action sequences earlier in the film. They take full advantage of Venom's powers, morphing and extending his arms in to various weapons. Unfortunately the actions sequences do seem to get worse as the film goes on, with a final battle between two symbiotes which ends up being the kind of computer generated mess that you would expect to see in a Transformers movie. Though the main driving force that gives this franchise some potential is Tom Hardy. Whilst he doesn't get the opportunity to show himself being slowly corrupted by the symbiote, it is great to see Hardy get a chance to stretch his comedic muscles, arguing with a character than nobody else can see like a psychotic version of Will Ferrell from Stranger than Fiction. Unfortunately outside of Venom there's not much for the supporting cast to work with. The villain played by Riz Ahmed feels just like any other crazed entrepreneur and whose motivations are never made clear. Also Eddie's ex-girlfriend is played by Michelle Williams, who does have some good chemistry with Tom Hardy but also has so little to do in the film that her role feels pointless. Overall, it's not the best set up for a franchise (which like every other superhero film already has an after credits scene already confirming a future sequel). There are a few things to work with through the fun dynamic between Eddie and Venom and the creative designs, but hopefully a future sequel will be able to develop Venom's character more effectively.",Venom
312,TheDyingGirl,A solid 4 !!,4,16 March 2019,It's not very good . Most of the time it's a snooze fest!!,Venom
313,Caleb_Everett,Just too short...,5,16 January 2019,"Venom isn't a terrible movie, I just think it's too short. Personally, I feel like the pacing of the movie is lightning fast and therefore causes you as the viewer to be scratching your head because they aren't answering any questions. One specific one is they never explain why Venom ISN'T killing Eddie. At one point they say he's a perfect host, but then in the doctor's office, it shows that Eddie is, in fact, dying, then at the end of the movie, just no mention of it. I thought Tom Hardy did a great job, but that's nothing new, he's an all-star.",Venom

316,gerry_barnaby,Great but Generic at the same time,7,3 October 2018,"Venom is it any good.......... Well i'l be honest it good but there is a lot of issues I had with it, the certification isn't one, which im glad they took it to at least a 15 cert instead of the stupid 12A- PG-13 route because it allows the character to be a bit better, but I do feel the R-rating would have been better.The Biggest problem with Venom being a low certification is carnage, which could be in a sequel if this film is a success in box office, its need to push it to R-rating because of the PG13- 12A, 15 certs won't work for it.Not that im saying this venom film was a disaster because it's not but the film does have some major issues in it casting and storytelling, which is a shame because there are areas in this film that were generally funny (mainly the building scene) The humour is very sarcastic from the character of venom, so it gonna be that moment unless you find sarcastic humour funny, you might not like the humour in this film. Tom Hardy hardy performance is brilliant in playing the report asking the hard the questions and pushing boundary that everyone doesn't dare ask, this is how the real reporter gets the hard truth and doesn't makeup thing for a story.Tom performance give a great scared and vulnerable person when he first meets venom, giving off a guy that has no clue what the hell is going on which sell the character more, Venom himself is a awesome character but so hell back slight with the Certification. I noticed at the beginning of the film, which not a lot of people born after the 90s won't know about is the very scene at this point was actually the original storyline of Venom origin to earth with a slight story chance that was more plausible for the story which did help.We get a lot of great fight scenes through the film, with a few moments of funny humour (if you can get the sarcastic humour) while the film does maintain some element of that dark edge. The visual effects are great on venom especial the humour, but there is an area with the visual that is bad. This sadly is where im gonna have to rip into the film bad points there a few of them. Dislikes: 1. Casting. Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake / Riot, Riz is a good actor, even I can see that but playing the antagonist villian in the film, ya sorry just wasn't feeling it, not sure if it was the writing for character or just the way he was he's portraying this role, he just didn't have that ruthless charismatic tone to be a character. This sadly makes the villian of the film very generic which I hate because it pulls the film down.2. Casting. Michelle Williams playing Anne Weying, Again Michelle is a great actress ive seen her is so many great films where she shined given a great performance in those films. Here in venom again great performance but I feel she was the wrong casting for this role, I'll explain, there was zero chemistry between William and Hardy on the screen. Which made the romance and relationship together feel forced instead of feeling a natural connection with each other, I feel this Me to concept just didn't work in this film. 3. Visual effects. The motorbike chase there is a moment where it takes you out of the immersion of the chase which blantant Green screen shots, there was a moment where you can blatantly see that a stunt scene that it was Tom Hardy on the bike and a stunt double. I feel the close up scene of Tom Hardy on the bike were unnecessary, could have been edit out the film, because the rest of the scene was perfect.4. The story. The story felt very generic, Venom didn't show up until almost halfway through the second act but before we could get any build up with a showdown with Riot, the film was already over, this is where the writing failed. You have too many people writing on a story you get a mess of a film because of it, the direction of the film is going in serval direction and the moments that just don't seemly fit together. The flow of the film with it pacing is off which is bad for the film, this is why this film comes off great but still generic, I mean the whole build up between Roit and venom should have been from the end of the first act and not dragged out until the halfway through the second act. This is why I feel the film is Great in places but overall generic where the film could've been better. Overall: Great acting, Funny sarcastic moment, Great but generic story and bad casting with a generic villian",Venom

319,tresm87,Venom is an ambitiously accurate portrayal of the anti hero comic character that sets itself apart from the formulaic MCU as a highly entertaining standalone origin story.,9,7 October 2018,"While it may break away from the comics slightly by not including the Spiderman origin story, the true characterization integrity within Eddie Brock/Venom is vibrant and extremely close to source material. The story alteration might even improve the overall direction of this new standalone Venom series because now we can truly focus on Brock/venom and not have Parker/Spiderman constantly take away from his attention. I believe we've had enough of Spiderman, and honestly after the travesty that was Homecoming imho, I'm fine with that for now. Venom starts off with a bang and we get some nice new aspects to how the symbiotes came to be in this earth as well as some great character development of Eddie Brock's life before Venom. Let me just say that Tom Hardy Makes this entire film work with a completely passionately versatile performance showing immense acting talent like he always does. Once Eddie Brock achieves full symbiosis, it becomes an absolutely intense and fun experience to witness, and it really brought me back to the old comics. I've been a fan of venom for nearly 30 years and I can honestly say they nailed the relationship between Brock and venom, and it's damn right awesome to see it on the big screen. The action never lets up after that and there were some insanely well done sequences full of amazing visuals. I honestly thought the CGI use for venom looked spectacular, and about as good as you could have it. The unexpected X factor of this film was it's hilariously twisted dialogue between Brock and venom, and honestly at times it was almost charming in a way. While there were a few bits that were absolutely ridiculous, I was able to overlook those few and far between moments. I thought Riz Ahmed what is a serviceable enough Carlton drake/riot, and played the conniving billionaire villain decently. I do think the plot was a bit rushed towards the end, but the finale was very exciting regardless. The post credit scene leaves you with an incredible sense of anticipation for the next venom installment as it introduces one of the most violent and brutal characters in all of comics. I did however think he was going to be in this film a lot more and was slightly disappointed ,but when I know what the future holds, I can forget about that slight nitpick. Another huge aspect of this film that breaks away from the safe MCU formula, is its sheer visceral brutality minus any blood really. They actually did a great job on a PG-13 rating making it still a very dark and violent film with some outstanding body horror sequences. I do really hope that they will go for an R rating for the sequel once carnage starts wreaking pure havoc. They would benefit so much from making it R rated. Overall an excellent origin tale,and a surprisingly funny film that deserves a ton of credit for going against the grain and breaking out of MCU formulas to start its own Venom universe. This is not part of the MCU and it's better off for it. I cannot wait for the next film to see Harrelson bring the CARNAGE!",Venom
320,kaden_lewis,Venom,9,3 October 2021,"This was a solid movie. It had some good action scenes, some good laughs, and a cool plot. There were a couple good fight scenes, but the two that stick out were the motorcycle chase scene, and the final battle. The motorcycle chase scene was a classic car chase scene, but it was still pretty cool. It felt more fast paced than some other car chase scenes, and I liked that. Also, the final battle was very cool. Venom Vs Riot, two huge powerful symbiotes fighting on a space ship was very cool to watch. This movie also had some good laughs. Venom is hilarious, especially when he and Eddie bicker. Finally, I personally liked the plot. I though it was unique, and interesting. I just liked it.Do not listen to the critics about this movie, it was a good, solid action movie and I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to watch it.",Venom

2021 or 2022 sequel announced.My favorite line in this movie: ""Goodbye Eddie.""Just watched it for a 2nd time. Loved it the first time; loved it even more the second time.I am shocked at the fact that despite the HORRENDOUS CASTING (except for Tom Hardy of course), the movie was still awesome. It must be thanks to everyone else who worked to make up for the cast's deficits.John Papsidera, CSA - during the credits at 1:33:50 it says casting was done by this guy. So this guy is the man guilty for casting the wrong people for this movie (the female supporting actress and the villain specifically). If it was not for the CGI, cinematography, screenplay, plot, and Tom Hardy, this unforgivable casting mishap could have caused the whole film to fail.Tom Hardy (the protagonist) - this guy made up for all the bad acting in this film. He did a great job acting.Michelle Williams (the female supporting actress) - I have NEVER seen a worst female supporting actress as bad as this woman. Worst acting ever. Definitely wrong actress for this role. Maybe all the good actresses out there were busy with other films and turned down the role; this must have been the case to go with this so-called ""actress.""Riz Ahmed (the antagonist) - very poor acting overall; very underwhelming. Cannot believe this guy was casted as the main villain.Jenny Slate (the scientist) - she did good.
Reid Scott (the MD) - he did fine.
Scott Haze (head of security) - he did fine.CGI and special effects: excellent; lovely. Loved Venom all the way. His voice too. Awesome fighting scenes especially the final fight. I mean I re-watched the 86th minute of this film at least TEN TIMES. The orchestra was excellent in this minute.Cinematography: great; no complaints.Plot: simple and sweet. No complaints.Conclusion: simple and sweet plot; awesome special effects and CGI; great cinematography; great final battle; good ending; great character development of the protagonist and venom. Tom Hardy was excellent as the protagonist; however, Michelle Williams was the worst possible ""actress"" for the female supporting actress, and Riz Ahmed was a very poor choice as the movie's villain. Despite the poor casting choices, the film's finale was so well done that it made me overlook the poor casting choices and made me love the movie a lot.10/10",Venom

I've seen a lot of people complaining about how it should've been an R rated gorefest, full of spine breaking and pancreas eating, but personally I don't believe it would've done as well if it actually was an R rated gorefest.While yes, the story is a bit run-of-the-mill, big bad organization messes with aliens, aliens try to take over, one alien says no and hooray day is saved. Tom Hardy does an amazing job of making Venom stand out from all your other Sci-Fi superhero movies. I reckon the main reason I like it is because it has the perfect blend of 'funny' and 'cool'. I'm a sucker for sci-fi, action, comedy, and superhero movies, and Venom just takes the cake for me.

It didn't really make me hyped to see it, but I weren't against seeing it.Anyway, the first half of the movie is pretty much like my first paragraph in this review, boring, repetitive and ultimately useless to the story.Halfway through something happened, it felt like a tonal shift and everything became enjoyable. The action scenes were great, the lighting and suspense were okay. There are some complaint I have, one of which is the special effects at certain times, another is the ""oh no he died, just kidding""-cliché.All in all, do I think the critics are right on this one? No. Do I think this is an amazing movie? No. Is it enjoyable? Yes. Would I watch it over and over again? Probably not, but I wouldn't switch over to another channel if I saw it on TV.",Venom

A few of the performances felt somewhat 'phoned in', and the film's tone was all over the place. It did make me laugh though, and some of the conflict between Brock and his alien parasite was brilliant - Hardy did a great job of acting the dual role. There were genuine moments of brilliance in the film, but then there were also many ameteur moments too. The final battle could have been better - as it is its a bit of a confusing CGI mess of tentacles and slime where it's hard to see what's happening. Overall I wouldn't say the film is bad as such - if you leave your brain at the door it is fairly entertaining. Hopefully they employ some better script-writers for the inevitable sequel...",Venom

Honestly this film was everything from what it was suppose to be for the start of the Sony universe. However Sony once again had to make their arms right, since they can't have directors have a vision in the movies they make such as Raimi and Webb. This film is so fast pace that I was like woah where did this come from. I saw this film thinking Sony would do better than this but since it's Avi Arad who want to make product instead of making a film. It's what we got at the end. I wish this film was better and I wish we saw this film play out differently such as the relationship between Eddie and Anne (who in the comics were actual husband and wife). We didn't get any development and the relationship ended so quick, I was confused. Yeah Sony cut out a bunch of scenes from the movie and made it differently than it was before. Plus RIot and Carlton Drake were so one dimensional and so lazy. Really wished they put more effort into his character. I did however enjoy the feud between Eddie and Venom. Tom Hardy did a steller job at the role of the character. And I didn in fact like the designe of Venom since it does make him look terrifying than in Spider-Man 3. But overall yeah this movie was bad. But it was so bad that it turned out to be good. For me this was a fun movie and I had a blast even with negatives as well. I hope in Venom 2 we get an R rating for the next villian who I am have been dying to see as a kid. Carnage. HE NEEDS to BE rated R. 7/10 for Venom.",Venom

Firstly is because the lack of special effects and action scenes. The story is boring, yet can be guessed so easily. Then there are many plots jumped without any explanation, so that only Marvel big fans could understand the main story. Besides, the main story about the combination of alien and human, explored with gimmick stories. Well, this is fun at first, but at then end we just spend so much time without any feedback of the whole point, not surprising, yet entertaining. The Venom character played by Tom Hardy is very good, but other actors had ordinary acting, just like a typically flick action. I have been waiting Venom so long, but when I watched it, I feel dissappointed. I hope there will be new Venom with new film makers crew.",Venom

341,Brevin_Campbell,It so bad its good,6,21 October 2018,I am going to be real with you guys. This is not a good movie. Just as far as how well it is made it isn't good. Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock is one of the most unrealistic characters ever created. He supposed to be this accomplished guy at the beginning of the movie but he never comes off as that. He comes off more as a complete idiot and a total douchebag. And there are some lines in this movie that was just really stupid and there is also a lot of unintentional hilarious moments from the entire cast that makes no sense.And yet this movie for some reason works for me. With all of its stupid and crude humor it comes off as a great little B movie. It cheesy and campy and feels like it comes right out of the Blade era of movies with things like Fantastic or and Daredevil. The bond between the symbiote and Eddie is amazing and there dynamic together just really works well.The CGI in this movie is ok at best and awful at worst. The final battle in the movie feels really poorly put together like someone rushed there After Effects work and turned it in really fast.The bond between Eddie and his girlfriend also kinda sorta worked for me. Mostly cause I think she is in love with symbiote and I think from the point when she finds Eddie with it onward the movie works perfectly.Overall while Venom isn't good it is at least fun so if you want to watch a fun movie with your friends then this is it.,Venom

Tom Hardy was good as Eddie, the special effects were decent and there was the odd laugh. At the end of the day I felt it was an OK movie, not great or even good but just OK - somebody a bit younger than me or a fan of the Marvel / Superhero genre will probably score it much higher than I did, give it a go, you might enjoy it a lot more than I did.",Venom
343,CriticalOfEverything,A tonal and dated mess.,1,3 October 2018,"Just when I thought that NOTHING could top The Happytime Murders as the worst movie of the year, Venom comes out. I already thought the movie looked awful and the writing from the trailers was atrocious, but surely it couldn't of been worse than all the other terrible movies I've seen this year, right? Venom is a mess. It is only able to be enjoyed ironically. It feels INCREDIBLY dated. If this movie came out 10 years ago like it should have then I could probably excuse it, but it decided to come out in 2018. The writing is atrocious and it has one of the most inconsistent tones ever. Is it meant to be a horror/thriller? Or is it meant to be a comedy? Having comedy and darkness spread throughout your movie is fine but with Venom it just feels like they had no idea what tone to give it. Eddie Brock is also a massive moron in this movie and I'm just so disappointed with the fact that there will never be a good movie to use Venom well. Spider-Man 3 was utter garbage and used Venom poorly, and now this movie, with it's ONE GOAL of trying to make Venom work in a movie, fails on every level. Please don't see this if you want a thrilling and serious movie. This isn't that. This is a top notch comedy act done by Tom Hardy's terrible casting for this role.",Venom

The first fifteen minutes is not as seamless as other Marvel offerings when it comes to the character introduction but when the pace picks up, one can't help but guffaw at the funny lines and the action scenes which even though not as original as expected, it still provides adrenaline rush to the viewer. Tom Hardy fits the "" sweet loser"" role to a T. The main cast also delivered good, only noticeable that Riz Ahmed seems to be typecasted to roles as young billionaires who have grand schemes in their heads. All in all, seeing Tom Hardy as the reporter Eddie with an internal symbiote forming inside of him, becoming him, anti-hero sort of hero character will kind of remind you of people you might see or even know, whose attention seems elsewhere and there's a dialogue with himself and another version of himself talking to each other.

The story and acting is not compelling at all and its quite a forgettable movie. The battle scene at the end is nothing new when it comes to action. Somehow people still fizz of these types of movies, but I wasn't fooled to think this was anything other than average. The advertising won out on this yet again.",Venom
349,margulanabutrlov,Venom Review,8,25 March 2019,"TV investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is working on an exposé of scientist Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), who is using San Francisco's homeless as guinea pigs to bond humans with aliens. Sneaking into Drake's lab, Eddie's body merges with symbiote Venom who gives him super-strength, a deep inner voice and a huge appetite.
Movies haven't been kind to Venom. Third-wheeling behind Sandman and the New Goblin in Spider-Man 3, and with a background nod in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, David Michelinie and Todd McFarlane's unfriendly neighbourhood symbiote now stars in his own film that mostly botches its attempts to bring the anti-hero to life. Lacking the we-know-how-to-do this confidence of Disney's MCU, Ruben Fleischer's film never finds a strong footing, mixing drab stretches of plot, efficient but flat action, mishandled comedy, a few fun elements and squandering one of the most exciting casts of the year.
The first act is ham-fisted, charmless and dull. There is a protracted set-up where Eddie (Hardy) loses his TV reporting gig, his lawyer girlfriend Annie (Michelle Williams) and his life by going off-message when interviewing scientist Carlton Drake (Ahmed). The latter is pushing forward with dangerous experiments combining humans with symbiotes, icky shape-shifting blobs that enter the body by osmosis. At the same time, there is another symbiote on its way, body-hopping from a paramedic to an elderly Malaysian woman to a little girl on its journey to the States.
The storytelling here is blunt, but what's even more surprising is the lack of chemistry between Hardy and Williams, two of the most charismatic actors on the planet. Hardy's performance in particular is fidgety, muted and curiously unengaging; Williams also toils away in a nothing-y fiancée-moving-on role. Completing the troika, Venom also has another collector's item - a bland Riz Ahmed turn as an Elon Musk-y visionary saddled with dreadful dialogue (""Find my Symbiote NOW"").
On paper, Fleischer is a good fit for the material. His best work, Zombieland, found a sweet spot of laughs, gore and energy, a good checklist for any Venom movie. Yet he cannot find the correct timbre here. The action, from Brock/Venom brutally seeing off Drake's goons in Eddie's apartment or a bike-car-drone chase, to Venom taking down a SWAT-like team in a smoke-filled foyer, has little verve or spirit and just ends up being deadening. The comedy doesn't land either. Eddie embarrassing himself in front of Annie in a posh restaurant by scoffing lobster and jumping into fish tanks feels too timid to be funny. There is a sense, both through elements of Hardy's physical performance and some of Venom's facial expressions, that Venom echoes The Mask. It wants to be all portentous and Marvel-y (Ludwig Göransson's bombastic score, the end credits malarkey), but channelling Stanley Ipkiss might have been a helluva lot more entertaining.
Venom is neither triumph nor train-wreck. It's a mediocre origin story, a superhero host that sadly fails to bond with its comedy parasite. Which is a shame, as there is enough here to to suggest it could have been a blast.",Venom
350,El-Ak,"Yup, critics were harsh but not too much.",5,28 November 2018,"Let's in general say that I came out of the film about 20% satisfied from Venom because of Venom itself which was ""almost"" the best thing in the film in Vfx and entertainment and not much as a character which went with the naive current of the film. Weak picture with the bluish dark effect in most of the scenes to give you the dark feeling which was noisy for me. My gosh, The story was just bad, The first 36 minutes building till we reach to Venom was disastrous , Eddie's relation with Anne (Michelle Williams) and it's very fast progress in three or four shots which didn't even make an impact for it's existence with Anne's character completely neglected and was unnecessary for the film with such the worst screenplay written for characters you can hear and I can't say that Michelle was even acting. Tom is the only interesting thing in the film of course with an average performance for the character that I didn't use to from him but I can say that it's the story along with the bad direction. The Vfx were very silly and quite disastrous in actions scenes but for Venom's design and appearance along with some fight scenes. The music written was very ordinary. The worst beginning I could imagine for the film because of the Vfx along with the story and how it was all done. Also the villain performed by Riz who is a weak actor for me with such a terrible performance and didn't even understand what he liked about the character. The cinematography just didn't fell right in the shots it took and the action scenes with the bad editing which didn't bring a fine picture with noticeable details cause of too much cuts and the scenes of showing off in the movie was not well done though it's good. The relation between Eddie and Venom and it's fast progress and the unreasonable turns it took rapidly with the reactions of Eddie and the most silly plot which led to the end from Venom wasn't convincing and he wasn't presented much powerful as I thought it would be. Also the story had that replayed scenes in different situation like the one when his neighbor was playing loud music with the silly angry reaction he took which could be understood If it was with Venom but it was before him and then happened again with the same reaction but with Venom so, are you telling me you are kinda stupid!?. Also the scene where the editing copied WWE and did that triple replay of a damn car hitting the front of two damn cars blocking the way for what was the replay I ask , did you see it the most dangerous move in the film!!. Finally , some black comedy came out of Venom which was pretty funny along with the entertaining yet not reasonable and fast relation with Eddie turned out to be fun and entertaining after all and even If the movie was R rated , it wouldn't have been better. 4.5/10 for the average Vfx and entertainment of Venom with Tom hardy and the surprises in the film and being harsh with the rating because of the high expectations and wasting a story where the hero is Villain but doesn't mean that you watch it and have enjoy in the end.",Venom
351,ajzeg,Pure garbage!,2,15 September 2019,"This movie is bad! It's not well-written, it's not technically well-made, and it is stupid! However, I actually enjoyed it a little. Most of this movie I found to be slow and kinda dull. It takes a while to get going, but when it does, I started having fun. This movie is at its best when it is being crazy and over-the-top! However, there isn't a lot of that in the movie. That only really happens in the middle of the movie. It takes a long time to get going, it goes for a little bit, and then it just kinda ends abruptly before it even really begins. It's very poorly paced, probably because of the re-edits. I thought there must've been more to this movie, I was only 90 minutes into what's supposed to be a 110-minute movie, but nope! That was it! There are, no joke, 20 minutes of credits! That's including two post-credits scenes, but you can just turn the movie off after the first one. The second is just a clip from Into the Spider-verse, nothing special. I heard there were about 40 minutes of footage cut from the final film, and yeah. It shows. Overall, this movie is a hot mess. If you're in the mood for garbage, give it a watch. It's like one of those less-than-wonderful 70s and 80s B horror movies. If you like that sort of thing, you'll like this. If you want an actually good movie with a similar premise, however, watch Upgrade instead.",Venom
352,ha77y73ad97,A film of 2 sybiotes,7,3 October 2018,"Overall this was an enjoyable film that finally does the venom and Eddie brooke characters justice after the dismal Spiderman 3At first this film is very slow and not that interesting, it's not until we find out how Eddie brooke has been fired, along with a small not to why this isn't set in new York with Spiderman! But once this film is up and running it's a non stop action and funny quip fest. Tom hardy is the perfect person to bring the down and out Eddie brooke to life and also lends his hands to the funny and brutal venom. From the first scene where a man's head gets bitten off to calling Eddie brooke a pussy venom is great as a character.An old school anti hero who's only real intention was to come to earth and eat everyone, ignore the critics that expect everything to be black panther and be a statement of social injustice. Have to admit if Spiderman ever came up against venom in a film it'll be the best Spiderman film since Alfred monlios doc oc in Spiderman 2! Also feels like it could have been the final chapter of the same trilogy.The bike / car chase was dynamic and brings the action to the film with a bit of the over the top comic book action from the 00s. Only downside to the final face of between venom and riot is a bit of a cgi blur and quite short, along with seeing a lot of the end fight in trailers and tv shorts don't help push the film for a higher box office, I'm my option was just a little bit to much shown.As I stated in the beginning this was a fun and enjoyable movie with a few flaws but these don't shine the experience. Can't wait to see what they have in store for the sequel as the mid credit scene is a perfect way to end the film, what ever you do please dont stick around until after the credits its not worth it!",Venom
353,DeadMansTrousers,"Not bad, but it had the potential to be amazing.",7,10 October 2018,"This movie has it's pros and its cons, overall it wasn't bad and it should've been great but it just fell short. People are getting too hung up on the fact that Carnage was only teased and the movie should've been R. While it would've been nice to see Carnage for more than two seconds I understand the reasoning behind their choices. Riot was also another OG Venom character even if he isn't people's favourite. One major thing I noticed about the movie that I felt made it fall a little short was the pacing. It all felt very rushed and Venom just changed his mind at the snap of a finger with his plans for earth and they didn't bother explaining it. Another thing that I felt effected the film was the build up. There is only one major fight between Riot and Venom and the rest of the film is just Eddie/Venom running around the city. It felt like there wasn't a whole lot there to enjoy apart from the motorcycle chase. Lastly the jokes. This film made the mistakes of putting the biggest joke of the whole movie in the trailer which was played nonstop. So naturally by the time you see the movie it isn't funny anymore. All that being said this movie has a great chast Riz Ahmed is always amazing and Tom Hardy did great. I just felt that it fell a little short of what it could've been.",Venom

356,Benslie,Would've been better R rated,6,4 November 2018,"My main problem with this movie was the pacing and editing. Both were all over the place. A few scenes seemed like they were missing a lot of stuff, no really there was one scene that just stopped. None of the scenes had proper transitions. This could be the main reason that the pacing was awful as well. The pacing in this film was off for this type of movie. This is supposed to be an action-packed thrill ride but it's just slow. Now the main villain is just so bland. He has no evil mastermind plan and doesn't even have a reason for doing what he does. He doesn't act like a villain. Now the acting in this film wasn't that bad but it just didn't come across as people I want to root to win. One thing I look for in movies is character development and if the characters had any. This movie had very little to none. The final bad thing I want to talk about is the tone of the film. This film is PG, in Canada, and PG13, in USA, so they had to throw in some humour for the kids but when it doesn't fit the tone of the movie, don't. There were way too many forced jokes into this movie that was just out of place. Now the only good thing about this movie was the action shots. Once the action happened then that's when I was fully invested in the movie. The action shots and the music that went with it was terrific. They looked well rehearsed and well shot and the editing on those scenes were spectacular. In the end, ""Venom"" was a slow movie that was only worth it for the action scenes and probably would have been better with an R rating",Venom
357,Better_TV,Wish It Took Itself Seriously,4,6 January 2019,"Eddie Brock/Venom is such a cool comic book character, and I'm a big fan of the source material. In the comics, he's a reporter with a grudge against Spider-Man who forms a union with a morphing alien ""symbiote"" that shares his hatred of the Webbed Wonder. Together, they're ""Venom"", at first a wrathful villain and later a monstrous anti-hero who protects the marginalized in NYC.Unfortunately, this film is way too vanilla -- and too goofy -- to do the Venom character justice. Part of that is the PG-13 rating, which kicks into high gear anytime a character would plausibly drop an f-bomb but says a lesser expletive instead. More importantly, it results in painfully obvious cutaways whenever the alien symbiote gets a hankering for human flesh (and heads).The other issue is the humor, which is now a certifiable part of the Marvel Movie Formula. When the alien starts talking to Brock and cracking jokes, making fun of his love life, and being forcefully ironic at ""hilariously inopportune"" times, I just had to shake my head. The comic books had it right, where the creature knew Brock's innermost fears, secrets, and desires, and would sometimes manipulate him or lead him towards questionable actions. Instead, what we have here is Deadpool-lite in alien form, all silly jokes and goofball humor when real gravitas is called for. Like many superhero movies, this one is ashamed of its source material and so feels it must cloak it with humor. That works in Thor: Ragnarok, but it's facile here.The movie's story is also too rote, too standard, too vanilla. It's loosely based on some of the comics from the 90s, but it's so un-involving; you'll see all the barely curved ""twists"" coming a mile away. It's hardly compelling, mostly acting as the glue for the action setpieces which unfortunately don't last long enough. I wish this film was crazier, more bombastic, even stupidly so like the first (and only watchable) Michael Bay Transformers movie. The plot of ""Venom"" is also suspiciously similar to 2008's ""Incredible Hulk"" with Edward Norton.The acting is decidedly average. There isn't much to Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock, a plain-jane everyman whose supermodel good looks never allow him to look as disheveled as his character is supposed to be. Michelle Williams is boring as Brock's ex, on whom is he is fixated, and Riz Ahmed is one of the most dull villains I've seen on screen in awhile. Edit all of his scenes and put them in a supercut on YouTube; you'll cure someone's insomnia.I'm a Venom fan, who reads Venom comics and just wanted a fun, bloody good time with bone-tearing symbiote action. Unfortunately this movie was too tame, and too un-interesting, to be the kind of turn-off-your-brain popcorn flick it wanted to be.",Venom
358,christophershobris,More Venom Less Talk,7,21 October 2018,"Before going into this film I was hearing all of the reviews from critics most of them bashing the film say all kinds of negative things. Therefore, I expected this to be a hot steaming pile of dog droppings, but actually it wasn't all that bad. There is certainly things wrong with it for sure, and it definitely isn't the best comic book movie of the year, but this could have been a lot worse. The opening sequence was well done which was followed by a long stretch of the film basically doing nothing, except character development and exposition scenes, it just talking and talking and talking...and more talking. I was growing impatient as I just wanted to see the thing I paid money for, and the reason why I wanted to see this movie, and that is Venom. It wasn't until I was halfway through the film before he finally appears. From then on however, the film turns to a whole new direction, quickly becoming the film I wanted to see. Venom was frickin' awesome. The CGI on him is flawless, the design is menacing and intimidating, the relationship built between Eddie Brock and Venom becomes genuine, like you don't want them to split apart. Tom Hardy is a class act, and one of the most talented actors working today. The complexity in his acting as well as tackling the challenge of playing two characters and keeping it real is a testament to Hardy as a performer. And yes, Hardy provides the voice of Venom. The action scenes were fast-paced and sometimes vigorously violent. The fight scenes were good, but one fight sequence I had a problem with because it took place at night, and when you a characters wearing black it can be hard to see what's going on. Riz Ahmed is good acting the role, the character however is underdeveloped and utterly useless. Everybody else does a fine job. Clearly the best thing about this film is Venom himself and the relationship between Venom and Eddie Brock. That alone makes this film overall enjoyable, somewhat engaging, intense, along with some mistakes with the first half of the film, one fight sequence, and needless supporting characters. I wouldn't go into this expecting Black Panther or anything, but it's well worth the investment.",Venom
359,mmuggi,Venom,8,4 June 2021,"Venom has been bashed by critics, which I can not understand. Tom Hardy is honorable, there is a pretty cool humor, Riz Ahmed is honorable as the villain and then the film has a perfect length.The CGI is sometimes poor, and sometimes moderate, I also have an appeal that there are no cameras at all at the Life Foundation. Likewise, the SWAT scene is generic, and I do not understand at all how Anne came in with all the encirclement that should be in place. Likewise, Venom sometimes knows what Eddie is thinking, and other times does not. The climax is also at the slightly thin end, and very typical superhero movie. This could have been challenged more with an anti-hero film like this one after all.Everything else being equal, the film is honorable, with focus points that can be directed to the upcoming sequel whitch I will definitely see.",Venom
360,jackson_ro,Venom,5,23 December 2018,"A disappointingly mediocre take on one of marvel's most interesting character. Hardy as venom has so much potential on paper but everything about this film seems mediocre. From the plot lines, the villain, the love interest, everything seems to be there just to get by. Some great action scenes here and there, but not enough to making the film anywhere near the standard of so many other superhero films. Maybe it is better for everyone involved if Disney can just get all the IPs back sooner rather than later.",Venom

Happily after some 15min. it moved us to the right direction, with some tensions, thriller moments, and finally with upcoming good humor.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing. This idea had potential, but the execution results in a bunch of cliches (particularly as concerns the ""villain"", a stereotypical tech CEO.)Tom Hardy is great to watch no matter what movie he's in.

Occasionally it works, but mostly it doesn't. Mr. Hardy does his best but his character, Eddie Brock is just so 2 dimensional and badly written. Are we to believe a top notch journalist is actually such a loser? Tom is also far too old to play this part, Eddies very many character flaws could be excusable in a 25 year old but not someone clearly in his early 40s.
I'm not normally a big fan of CGI extravaganzas with run times of 2 hours plus with only 5 minutes worth of plot. In fairness, Venom is attempting to break that mould but I must admit to feeling a bit cheated. Is that it? Isn't there anything more? No, there isn't....",Venom
364,thisseatofmars,"""We... are Venom.""",10,5 October 2018,"""Venom"" is the best superhero movie I've seen in a long time, partly because it turns the superhero formula on its head. While good, I find The Dark Knight movies usually too intense and serious, while most Marvel movies are too tongue-in-cheek (like constant little jokes Marvel movies inject to mollify a scene's tension). It's interesting then that this film, about a character who looks like a demon from Hell, manages to strike that perfect balance between being dark, intense, and light humour. And make no mistake, Venom is a real monster. He eats the brains of his foes and his voice could make the Predator wet himself. But it's not all dark and intense: Venom is *likeable.* He doesn't make quips; he's earnest. If Venom isn't telling the hero to eat the brains of villains he is egging the hero on to get back with his ex-girlfriend. That is *genius,* and this interest that Venom has in people leads to some fantastic moments in the movie. There's a scene where Venom convinces the hero to apologize to the ex, and the hero does so, ending resentment between the two. When this happens Venom says, completely unironically, ""Aw. That's nice."" I love Venom, the character, and watching him interact with the people around him is just as entertaining as the insane fight scenes where he is decimating whole teams of armoured, armed men. Venom is charismatic and fascinating; I'd love to see more of him interacting with Eddie Brock (the film's protagonist character) and seeing the conversations they'd have. I have to commend the filmmakers on Venom's design: he is huge and brutal and he animates beautifully, from the saliva dripping from his lizard tongue to his creepy, bulbous eyes. Venom should always have that insane, rictus grin on his face; I never like seeing Venom in the comics without it. Having Venom wearing the grin throughout the movie was definitely the right way to go. Tom Hardy is a great actor and his talent delivers the human element of the movie. He's played Bane in Batman and Max in Mad Max; he demonstrates range by playing humorous scenes and the fish out of water character of Eddie Brock, who is utterly bewildered by becoming the host to Venom. Michelle Williams is great as Brock's ex; she is spunky and tough and Hardy and Williams work well together. But Venom steals the show. Brock and Venom have more chemistry than Brock and the love interest. The opening of the film is somewhat slow, but they have a lot to set up. The post-credits scene features Brock meeting Cletus Cassidy, and Woody Harrelson is the most perfect choice to play the role, but the wig they gave Harrelson was ridiculous.

First half goes very well in terms of setting the story and the venom universe, second part is more about action and there it has a few flaws but it is still fun and interesting to watch.
It is a cool view on the ""almost anti-hero"" venom/eddie character that kept my attention.
I had a good time watching this in the theaters and i ll definitely have a second view when it comes out in bray or dvd.

371,WooderIce64,"Tom Hardy is good. The rest, not so much.",6,6 February 2019,"Venom is part of Sony's Marvel Universe, alongside the Amazing Spider-Man movies. Venom appeared on the big screen one, in Spider-Man 3. It was bad. He was too small, too scrawny, they messed up his voice, and he had too little screen time. Venom is one of the most popular comic book villains of all time, and he's certainly a good choice for his own movie. Giving him his own movie made up for Spider-Man 3, although it's not really the best movie. It's not terrible, but it's not great. It follows a similar story to Eddie Brock's in Spider-Man 3. He's a reporter who gets fired after he crosses the line, struggles to get by, and finds the symbiote.Tom Hardy plays both Eddie Brock and Venom, and he's never bad in a role. He plays both parts very well, and there's an interesting relationship between the two. It's similar to the relationship between Gollum and Smeagol in Lord of the Rings, where they inhabit the same body but are still two distinct personalities with differing beliefs and objectives. The symbiote is somewhat like the One Ring in that regard. The dialogue between the two is also occasionally hilarious. Venom himself also looked great. He looked almost exactly like he did in the comics, with the gooey skin that looks almost liquid. After the disappointment of Spider-Man 3, even though that was over 10 years ago, it was fantastic to see Venom go on a rampage like we'd expect him to. All of the action scenes were great, especially the final battle. And for as much as this is a Venom movie, it's an Eddie Brock movie. While it take a while for the symbiote to show up, Tom Hardy nails the role of Eddie Brock.There are, however, some downsides. The writing is just bad. The ""turd in the wind"" line became a meme for a reason. Aside from that, I don't like the idea of Venom becoming a good guy of sorts, having to stop Riot from bringing more symbiotes to Earth. Venom is one of the most iconic supervillains in comic history and having him play this hero role minutes after eating people on the street was out of place and out of nowhere. Even the movie's tagline was ""the world has enough superheroes."" It also makes Spidey's absence all the more noticeable, although this movie didn't need him. The story it decided to tell probably did. The rest of the characters really aren't anything to report on. You've got the ex-girlfriend, her new boyfriend, the secretly evil genius, and the doctor who knows something's up with him. Pretty standard stuff. Venom is a pretty mixed bag. It's not super serious stuff, and it's not really meant to be. It's a fun popcorn movie. If you like superhero movies, you'll probably enjoy it.By the way, the post-credits scene is awful. They try to set up Carnage as the next villain, which is a lateral move, but Woody Harrelson puts on this ugly wig to play him. He looks like Sideshow Bob. If that's what's going to happen in the sequel, they'd better at least change the way he looks without the symbiote. He just can't go through the movie like that.",Venom

374,hotrobinproductions,Venom is what I threw up after watching this.,3,10 April 2019,"To be honest I wanted to see what the audience saw that critics didn't. And I went into this movie expecting it. This film is so boring bland and uninventive. Definitely would have appealed more possibly maybe 10 years ago, back to when the genre wasn't overly saturated and well known. But no, even then this films script is god awful and so bad. One of the worst scripts written of 2018, surprising enough the same writer wrote the script for aquaman which was a film that I overall enjoyed but the script was my biggest issue and of course it had to be the same person. The only thing this movie has going for itself is the performance by Tom Hardy, he steals the show with his acting and performance as usual. Everything else was either bad or generic. Even the venom character was so god awful. (I'm not a fan of judging a film so harshly on CGI and I won't do that, in fact I thought it was solid work with the effects department, and it wasn't distracting me from the plot so I'm ok with effects, and if anyone uses that as a reason to bash this film I think it's unfair, if that's that case you should bash older movies back in the 70s for having effects that weren't good) but back to venom, his CGI was great, his character was so terrible, THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE TRANSCENDED THE GENRE TO NEW TERRITORY, think about it VENOM is a VILLAIN not a HERO. Sure I'm familiar with comics and he was a anti hero in some, but this movie missed the mark to create a unique film, this movie is so bland and generic I felt as if I watched it before, the characters are boring the villain is even more boring the CGI final fight was ehh, and the ending is ugh, the action is so repetitive and unnecessary, this movie was god awful and the soundtrack was even worse, this movie is the downfall as compared to Eminem's song for this movie which was probably arguably even more worse and annoying than the film itself. (AND IM A HUGE FAN OF SLIM SHADY) Venom should have been DCs joker. Taking a villain and making a compelling story of the villain landscape, but no they turn him into a forced PG13 freak forced terrible dialogue and a plot so boring and far from original that the only interesting thing this movie has going for itself is the concept of the symbiotic/human relationship which for me gets interesting with Tom hardy and venom
until it gets annoying and the performance by Tom hardy holds this film up. THATS IT. The acting is all around actually good as well, it's just the script that really holds the film so far back and it's the characters around Eddie that make it so boring that I don't even like the characters no matter how good their acting and performance is.Acting 7/10
Script 2/10
Plot 3/10
Screenplay 5/10
Cinematography 4/10
Soundtrack 2/10
Special Effects 7/10
Editing 4/10Overall Venom has its moments to be held and saved nearly by Tom hardy, but the film was shot so blandly the bad script takes over the film very much and the compelling aspect that makes a film unique doesn't even feel like it's there, feels as if the director forced it to be there. This film should have been such indistinguishable and more hah just another generic boring story. Am I saying they can't make a pg13 venom movie? NO, and I think going a anti hero route can be cool, but this movie isn't doing it folks, and I am sure if they went the darker direction into diving into the villain side it would have been much better, but no, Sony wanted that money and these people gave it to them for this garbage film. terrible film 5/10 and that's just being nice",Venom

The interactions between Venom and Eddie (Tom Hardy) get quite amusing once he figures out that he has a parasite in him. Michelle Williams really seems out of sorts in this kind of movie. It almost seems like she did it for a paycheque rather than doing the movie because she likes the material. Her character is flat and kind of boring. Villain is very typical rich guy. 
My biggest problem with this movie I found plagued another movie, Spawn; it seems either Sony or the writing team couldn't decide on whether this movie should be PG-13 or rated R and it does hurt the movie. It really makes me curious as to the edited 40mins that were left out.

More power to ya! Me? I turned Black Panther off not even ten minutes in. So why I chose to watch Venom, the commercially successful and critically panned 2018 film starring Tom Hardy as the titular anti-hero/pro-villain(?) might seem odd on the surface, sure. But my approach was threefold: (1) Venom/Spiderman were my favorite characters during my brief childhood fascination with actual comic books, (2) I think Hardy is a nutty genius actor and I would watch him in anything, and (3) the fact that this was *so* harshly panned (29% RT score!!) and not technically in the MCU (lol) completely piqued my interest for some reason. This movie is by no means a masterpiece obviously, but my appreciation of it is not ironic. It's not so bad it's good. It's just good good because it's a dumb fun movie. Period. You can pile on the asinine plot or over-the-top acting or maybe you had issue with the FX and character design. I don't watch enough of this genre to comment in a compare/contrast way.

Soon, he must rely on his newfound powers to protect the world from a shadowy organisation looking for a symbiote of their own.As one of the most anticipated movie of 2018, this review will contain lots of spoilers.. you've been warned!The plot of this movie is showing us that the symbiotes has arrived to our little blue planet, apparently by Carlton Drake, and then one of them escaped, and that's all! I wanted more, I wanted at least to know how did Drake know that these creatures are even existing, not only seeing the plane coming to Earth just like that, it was more than fast-paced than it should actually be.. and this is my biggest issue with this movie, it might be not that big, but when it comes in THE PLOT, it must be the biggest!!!Now to the first act... It was good as an introduction of every-single-one in this movie, but it went so slow-paced, it was fine for me after that huge fast-paced plot.The second act begins and the fun starts by Eddie gets Venom by Maria, and from that very specific moment (when Eddie got infected) the movie got so fun and fast-paced, with some amazing chasing mixed with action and a very exciting soundtrack, but it's not sinless because the second act has some very bad CGI, especially when the camera was focused on Eddie while driving. But Eddie talking to Venom was so amazing I can't describe how amazing these scenes were!! Then we get the very first whole Venom appearance scene, which was very good, but very short though, and here is another issue, we don't get that much of Venom scenes, we get his voice and some of his gadgets, I wanted more of that amazing creature!The third act was very good, I got satisfied especially when I saw the She-Venom, I didn't even think that they would actually put her in! Everything was great, until the finale, it was breathtaking, but very very short, but still very entertaining, but I hoped that it lasted more than what we got. The CGI was pretty good, and the soundtrack too.The movie was really good, I liked it, it disappointed me because I didn't get that much of the things I wanted to see in it, I mean the movie is just 1h 52min, they could have make it longer, but anyways it's some very talented performances except for Michelle Williams as Anne Weying, she was very annoying and I didn't enjoy watching her, and it has also a good story mixed with amazing action sequences and a great OST.

384,Eclectic-Boogaloo,Don't believe the venomous reviews,7,12 October 2018,"They got Eddie Brock and Venom right in every sense. The look of the character and the writing were both on point, as was Tom Hardy's committed performance as both Brock and Venom, the symbiote that takes control of him. It's the relationship between Eddie and Venom, which starts off as hate/love and develops into something of a bromance that really makes 'Venom' an enjoyable, if flawed, movie.Asides from Hardy's lead performance, the best in a comic-book movie in some time, the rest of the cast highlighted by Riza Ahmed and Michelle Williams are very good. The plot's very simple and straightforward. There are a couple of small surprises but no twists or story elements that really wowed me. Same with the romance between Brock and his girlfriend Anne. It was merely serviceable. A major criticism of 'Venom' that i feel is undeserved is of the consistency of its tone. While it IS tonally all over the place, moving from drama, to comedy, to horror, to romance, almost scene to scene... IT works. That's because it's in keeping with the madcap and tonally uneven nature of the lead character(s) and performances. Brock/Venom are all over the place. So is the movie. And it's fun.I'd say the only big negative is that the third act and the third act climax weren't great. The stakes were big, but they weren't set-up properly. I didn't care about what the movie was trying to get me to care about. Also, the final fight of the movie was very underwhelming. Like 'Wonder Woman' and 'Black Panther' the final boss fight in 'Venom' was way too dark and busy. Hollywood's obsession with making murky night-time CGI action scenes must die. In any event, 'Venom' was really enjoyable. Check it out, it's worth the money, time.P.S. Stay after the credits. The Eminem song rocks and there's a little something after it.",Venom

about that, but fast forward to 2018 with Tom Hardy in the lead role I was on 
board with it.This was a pretty standard adventure film at best but it was still good,
I would say the script was a little weak in places and the film as whole
was a little rough around the edges but I still liked it very much.The build up- is pretty standard stuff we've seen before but it's fine.The plot- is not the most original but still good.The CGI- was really good in my opinion, Venom looked fairly
real and he was interesting to look at too. besides don't listen to those
who say the CGI was bad what do they know.Overall, a popcorn fun action-adventure with anti-hero Venom,
Tom Hardy really caries this film well without him I think it
would have failed. Plus this leave you wanting more! 
which is always good in my book. I recently seen this in theaters
and i loved it. I give it a 7/10. I full-heartedly recommend it.",Venom

389,ytoshiya,One of best MARVEL movies,9,3 January 2019,"If you watch the spiderman, you should watch this movie because a bad monster from spiderman appeared in this movie.
What was good in this movie was that these monsters are basically bad monsters but venom which parasitized a main character turned into a good monster gradually regardless of that those monsters prefer destructions because a bond between main guy and venom were constructed gradually.
I can recommend this movie with all my heart!",Venom
390,Mccadoo,Phony reviews,1,4 June 2019,"I've suspected for some time now that many of the positive reviews on this site are bogus. Reading the reviews for this movie are the final proof I need;10 out of 10 reviews with over the top title lines like; ""Best movie ever"" or ""A masterpiece"". Hundreds and hundreds of them in which the reviewer writes a single paragraph, or even less at times, that does nothing more than tout how great the movie is and that you should ignore the critics and go see it. Something stinks here folks.And this movie convinces me because it got a whole lot of those 10/10 reviews and it is absolutely terrible. I mean, just awful. And yes, I know that here are a lot of brain dead drones out there who think any superhero movie is the equivalent of classic literature and gush over all of them, however awful they are. But not enough of them to account for so many 10's for such a bad movie.Why was it bad? Where do I start;Tom Hardy's character came across as a learning impaired teenager with a room temperature IQ. He talked liked a dolt, his actions throughout the movie made no sense, unless he was in fact at dolt. He was supposed to be a crack reporter yet his reporting style was atrocious and his sense of what reporters actually do was utterly absent. For a really good actor his performance was really bad.Michelle Williams; not even sure why she was in this movie unless it was for a paycheck. She was totally miscast and just not believable at all in her role. She couldn't pull of the funny bits (or what the director thought was funny) and she had zero chemistry with Hardy.The villain was about as villainous as a cranky high school kid. His actions in the movie were so illogical and senseless as to be stupid. You never understood what his motivation could possibly be because he didn't seem to know himself. And his staff were the most moronic bunch of scientists and doctors to appear on film since...well, since forever. As illogical and unmotivated as their boss was they were even more so. They were a bunch of sheep following along whatever he did. Oh, except for one of them, the woman who decided to turn whistleblower to Hardy's character then proceeded to do it in the most idiotic way possible. She may as well have come to work with a sign around her neck telling everyone it was her who let Hardly into the facility. Then she just sat in her office and waited to be killed. No one is that clueless.Humor; there was none even though the director and writer tried to inject it into the movie at every turn. Every single attempt fell so flat you could hear the thud in the theatre. The banter between Hardy's character and Venom sounded like the ramblings of two twelve year old's trying to be clever and failing miserably at it. It was immature and forced and just not funny. Michelle Williams character was just not clever, every time she tired to be edgy it was just embarrassing to watch. Trying to be Deadpool when you've already put together a putrid film is never going to go well.And finally, the CGI is this movie was truly awful. When I saw the previews I thought Venom looked like something from a kids Saturday morning cartoon show and assumed that in the movie it would be better. It wasn't, it still looked like a kids cartoon show. Venom was totally unbelievable as a real live entity, he just simply looked like a cartoon. And the non-threatening villain at the end even more so. They looked like special effects from a 80's or 90's movie only worse. Just absolutely terrible, I'd say it ruined the movie except that the movie was already ruined before Venom even made his first appearance.This is at best a mediocre children's movie, and I'm being kind. So yes, by all means DO believe the critics and avoid this train wreck at all cost.",Venom

392,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,Movie Review: Venom,4,6 April 2019,"Venom is a complete mess!Let's start with some positives shall we? This movie feauters one of the best action sequences of the year so far (nothing compared to anything in Mission: Impossible - Fallout but still impressive) where Eddie Brock (Hardy) escapes his persucers on a moterbike aided by the abliities of Venom. After a pretty slow bulid up this scene really beagn to peak my intrest and get me ingaged in the film, despite obvious cuts around the more violent moments this was a real highlight.It's a shame that the rest of the film cannont live up to this however, the paper thin plot moves at a snail's pace, any attempt at horror is lost in the edit and the massive CGI mess of a finale is extermly difficult to follow and extemly dull to watch.Riz Ahmed is terribly miss cast as a suposedly threatening villain and Michelle Williams plays the same shell of a character that she has been stuck playing for years. this cast desevers so much better than this and so does the character.I really don't have to much else to add about this film, it's just pretty boring. Honestly just watch Spider-Man 3 again!",Venom
393,Phil_M_A_Kerr,Creepy good fun for all,10,5 October 2018,It's been a long time since I've heard a cinema audience laugh together. Feels like a long time anyway. For a semi-cinema-snob like me this was a guilty pleasure. It's what a scary popcorn movie for teens should be. Most Marvel moofies are an excuse for us middle-aged folk to pinch a genre that belongs to young folk and labour it with heavy themes. This movie is as whacky as Tom Hardy's performance. The serious elements are not subtle but they're only riding on the coat tails of something absurd and funny. There's plenty of CGI but it knows its limits and is inventive within them. I knew I was in the right mood for this Fridi night popcorn movie. I'm glad a decent bunch of other folks were too.,Venom
394,Beachbum2018,Bit of fun for the actors I think,6,4 March 2021,"Totally respect Tom Hardy, probably my favourite male actor at the moment, and despite the fact this script was well within his capability I got the distinct feeling he really enjoyed doing it simply because it wasn't demanding like Warrior or The Revenant!
As a result it came across as acceptably funny for a sci-fi movie, which didn't kill it from an entertainment perspective.
The alien bits were actually good, creepy enough but not stupid, and the alien in my head voices helped sell the plot, a bit like the more expected gumshoe private investigator voiceovers!
Look it wasn't brilliant though it was fun, but it's never going to be classic sci-fi or an unplanned cult movie!",Venom

398,Luv2Spooge,One hell of a fun ride,9,12 May 2021,"I don't typically like comic book movies, but this one is one hell of a fun ride. It is cleverly written and starts out looking like Ridley Scott's Alien sci-fi horror before bait-and-switch into an action dark comedy sci-fi film. The dialog between Eddie and Venom is hilarious and it actually makes the story even more believable because oddly, you see the chemistry between the two characters as the bond and becomes one.I'm taking 1 point off because there were some plot elements I thought was not explained thoroughly enough. I mean, they're in there, but just wasn't clearly explained or focused. An example without giving spoilers is what happened to the yellow symbiote. It is in the film, briefly and they never verbally explained it. I felt as though they edited it too much, trying to fit it in a 1 hr 30 min confine.Also it took about 45 mins for the 1st real action sequence, which is 1/2 the movie. So the action sequence wasn't really smoothed out through the film. Basically 1/2 of the film is explaining and building up the background story, which is why perhaps they edited so much to cut it down. The 2nd 1/2 is full on action after action nonstop.But 9/10 ain't bad, right? Fantastic film.",Venom

401,MattyRich92,A Passable Superhero Movie,6,18 May 2019,"Interestingly, the movie is set in San Francisco, and Spider-Man is not mentioned at all. The banter Eddie Brock has back and forth with Venom, inside his own head, is the most amusing aspect of the movie. Everything else is just meh, especially the script. Also, there is no horror elements, except one early scene in the lab, which was lazily done. There is too much hype, about Spider-Man's most menacing villain/anti-villian, and it doesn't live up to the people expectations. But the critics backlash is unwarranted. What were they expecting? If you go into Venom expecting Avengers level entertainment, you'll be disappointed. But compared to the plethora of superhero movies that have been made in the last 10 years it's all right.",Venom

The plot holes are enormous and the movie is so slow. It took forever to get to the venom part of the movie so when it did they totally missed the mark. There were so many great opportunities to make some great scenes and instead they made venom look stupid. Some fight scenes were ok but the whole movie was a convoluted mess. It lacked direction and character development. This movie is like they took a good movie, put it in a blender and then tried to put it back together with pieces missing.

Venom better, because its copied formula of 80s - middle aged drunkard and he's... something. But even in this I go through like 30-40 minutes before anything really happens. 
And script is lame. I don't know in what world live Hollywood writers, but in REAL world when woman sooooo close to marriage go all over you in rage for some mistake and THEN only six month later she totally in another guy... well this woman a sl't and I really don't know WHY he asked for forgiveness, like who is she are anyway? He messed with her job, but she messed with his life. Its she need to say sorry to him.
So all film like this moment. Not very thoughtful.

409,joanacatbagan,A disaster but 70% enjoyable.,6,21 April 2019,"An absolute disaster in terms of structure, especially for such a big studio movie. But I was also surprised at how much I liked the Venom/Eddie relationship. It was funny!! It would have been even better if Venom's sense of himself as a ""loser"" (Trebek voice) on his own planet/compared to Riot was more developed. The symbiote fight looked cool! That said, I liked this more than the previous (and also a bad) Venom movie, Spider-man (2007).
As for the actors, Tom Hardy is always great and always delivers but with terrible execution of this film, it was all wasted. I also like Riz Ahmed but he didn't totally fit here. That's not all on him tho... past Eddie/Venom the script really falls off. Michelle Williams is pretty good but can't save her character either. Same with Jenny Slate. The credits scene is extremely on the nose but I like the setup. That wig.",Venom
410,johnplocar,"""Venom"" is fine...but I've also seen this year's ""Upgrade"".",7,12 November 2018,"""Venom"" starts off with a spaceship crash landing on Earth that is filled with alien entities , later labeled as 'symbiotes'. A secret science facility under the control of a powerful corporate tycoon, Carlton Drake, performs experiments with these symbiotes in an attempt to merge them with human test subjects. Eddie Brock, an investigative journalist, finds himself in the mix when he breaks into the facility to find out what's going on which winds him into a symbiotic relationship with the alien entity who calls himself Venom. Venom starts speaking to Eddie and even supplying him with special abilities. From there Eddie and Venom have to work together to save the day by stopping Drake's experiments and his diabolical plans to combine humanity with man eating symbiotes.I enjoyed this film, seemingly more than what a good portion of people thought of it. I avoided as many spoilers as possible, but it seemed like the word of mouth about ""Venom"" was relatively mixed. Either people hated it or they thought it was fine. I'm with the latter half and thought it was fine. Don't get me wrong, I don't think this was great or any sort of masterpiece because I had my fair share of issues with the film which I will get to, but for what I got I was decently enough satisfied.I would like to get into the positives before the negatives because I feel like the negatives may take up a bulk of this review honestly. Before we get to that, let me point out what I liked about ""Venom"". Number one being Tom Hardy; he is easily the best part about this movie. His performance as Eddie Brock and voice work as Venom was solid, I was mainly entertained by a lot of the humor found in their banter with one another; honestly the film could have used a lot more screen time of their quirky, opposing odds relationship. The look of Venom is pretty cool, it's nice to see a fairly accurate visual representation of the comic book character translated to the big screen. The action was fun to watch, aside from some poor CGI in parts, I thought that the fight choreography and action beats in general were well done. And that's about all I really got...This leads me to the negatives, a lot of which aren't necessarily the movie's fault, however the similarities between ""Venom"" and ""Upgrade"" are so undeniably there I can't help but compare. If you haven't seen Leigh Whannell's ""Upgrade"" here is a quick synopsis: ""Upgrade"" is set in a not so distant future where a mechanic, Grey Trace, and his wife are attacked by vicious criminals. The assault leads to the unfortunate death of Grey's wife, as well as Grey becoming a quadriplegic. Weeks later, Grey is approached by an old acquaintance that claims to be able to give him the ability to walk again with the help of an implant called Stem. After the surgery to implant the Stem microchip, Stem reveals that it can actually speak and begins to help Grey seek revenge on his wife's killers by supplying a set of new special abilities to him. And what you get is a superior version of ""Venom"".Both films involve a second party taking control of a man's body while this second party also has the capabilities of conversing with the human being effected, not only is this a major part of their stories but it also feeds into the action and the comedy of the films. However the symboitic relationship between Stem and Grey is far more developed and goes into far deeper themes than the one between Eddie and Venom which mostly feels simplified and more acceptable for mainstream audiences. Plus, as decent of a job that Tom Hardy gives with his physical performance, it really doesn't compare to the one Logan Marshall-Green gives in ""Upgrade"" where it truly feels as though there really is something else actually controlling his body functions. Both films deal with a romantic tragedy of sorts and ""Upgrade"" is the far more effective one because the one portrayed between Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams just feels underwhelming. The villains in ""Upgrade"" are so much more menacing and memorable than the corporate baddie or the other CGI splooge monster that I've seen a million times in other comic book movies. Which also brings me to the effects work; some of the CGI in ""Venom"" is bad. I mean really, really bad. Once it got to the third act climax when all I could make out from the action was the occasional face and a bunch of rubbery alien gack all over the screen, I was relatively annoyed by the incomprehensible mess on screen. Some of the effects were okay, but when you compare them to...""Upgrade""...there is no comparison. The practical effects in ""Upgrade"" are simply phenomenal and even the rare use of CGI in the film are decent, but with ""Venom"" it was severely hit or miss.Seeing how these are both action films, it only makes sense to touch on that aspect of course; and I've got to say that the action was more visually interesting and innovative in ""Upgrade"" with its concise camera movements and amazing fight choreography. ""Venom""'s action was good, but with all the bad CGI and the fact it was so obviously afraid to go for an R rating, it does sully the action a bit. It teases trying to insert a very light amount of gore, but because of how ""Venom"" is shot and edited it is barely coherent of what even happened. ""Upgrade"" keeps its story tight with an hour and forty minute run time while ""Venom"" pushes its run time to nearly two hours; which would be fine if it was filled with more of the arc and relationship between Venom and Eddie, but it squanders a good portion instead on unneeded scenes that only reiterate what the audience already knows. My last criticism is the ending; ""Upgrade"" has an ending that is risky and provocative while ""Venom"" has a very generic 'setup for sequels' type ending that was extremely on the nose and just simply lame.So I know that I basically bashed on ""Venom"" for most of this review, in all honesty I do recommend that you watch ""Upgrade"" over ""Venom"" any day of the week, but I actually still liked ""Venom"". I just had my issues with it. The villains, the special effects, the arc between Venom and Eddie, and the story all had their problems. But there was also enough entertainment gained from Tom Hardy, the action and comedy that it did carry me through easy enough. So if you are in the mood for some light action fluff, then ""Venom"" is perfect for that.",Venom
411,homeflash,Loser + Loser = Hero,10,29 November 2018,"Normally I don't give out 10 .. but this movie is great from start til the end although some plots are expected. (especially at the end)As a normal viewer, your expectation of monster movie will be like the monster is a bad guy.However, this movie is really coming out of the norm. The monster looking like alien is actually a hero at the end and it was a loser. And it matches his partner on earth which is also a loser. So what do you get when you get two losers, double negative makes it positive. A hero therefore is born.Nice CGI, good story.This movie also has some fun dialogue and I enjoyed it very much.

412,BiiivAL,"""Now, let's kick their fu*king heads off!""",8,10 November 2018,"Avayte from - venom, in my opinion, failed. I wanted to sneeze at the opinion of critics who were apparently expecting a marvel Studios level film from Sony. After the flow of mixed reviews-went with the most low expectations, with a good mood and in good company. Did it affect my final attitude to the film? I don't know. But let us, as usual, on the specifics.""Venom"" -this is a standard simple original film, which is especially the stars from the sky is not enough, but at the same time did not cause any obvious negative.I think the most correct step Sony not to be wise and show everything from the beginning, so as not to produce unnecessary questions and misunderstanding of the viewer. Show the history of character formation and its further development.The narrative can be clearly divided into three classic acts - the tie, the climax, the denouement. Venom simple as a penny - no problems, no unexpected plot twists that have, frankly, a bit fed up in kynoselen Marvel movies.The plot is definitely built around the character Tom hardy. Once again, I note that he is an amazing actor. Inviting him was a great decision. If he had not played a major role - perhaps someone else could and dragged. Hardy plays actually canonical Eddie Brock-downright really ""anti-hero"". Hardy is a lot, very much, he pulls the blanket over himself - his screen takes 90% of the time, and that's right for an original movie. Tom was able to make this character and the right way to submit it, so it just crashed into the viewer's memory.The rest of the cast also did not disappoint. For example, Reese Ahmed gave a good antagonist - Carlton Drake and liked Michelle Williams, who played Ann Weying.But back to hardy's character. Brock's relationship with the venom symbiote is what the film is built on. The rate at which the creators have put everything. And she played, that's for sure. Dive replicas and exchange of views made funny, and sometimes even witty. I liked this format of ""communication"" very much. Very cool showed that Eddie and the symbiote are learning from each other, and in the final part of the movie act really as a single unit.There are, of course, have movie and some cons. In the first place, it's not a very elaborate scenario. There are some logical inconsistencies, and they are striking, there are small sagging scenes and tedious, which could be abandoned. Also, not everywhere like the graphics - sometimes looked frankly cartoon, but we must pay tribute - really improved visual order of magnitude since the trailers and promotions.About the downgrade something to inflate do not see the point. Personally to me it didn't spoil viewing in General in any way. Moreover, I think that the film only benefited from this. You want blood, Guro and dismemberment-go to slasher. Well, the fact that the symbiote was supposed to do in terms of violence - he did, it was beaten and the coveted ""18+"".Was pleasantly surprised to see references to a sort of Canon of the setting Simbiotel. And, of course, the traditional cameo of Stan Lee, which now even our audience has learned to react correctly.Scene after the credits. The first is just gorgeous, one of the best post-credits scenes I've seen, including all past Marvel and DC movies. The scene gives us an unambiguous reserve and a hint of a sequel.In General, Sony-well done. If this is the start of your own movie universe, it is very sound and correct. I would like to see further projects. I think the Studio deserved this chance.Well, in conclusion, I would like to fix this: the opinion of critics-not always fair, downgrade-not always in the red. So, as the saying goes,""go and see.""",Venom
413,a_sad_cow,Needs to be a television series to develop everything they crammed into this movie.,6,31 January 2021,"On the upside, Tom Hardy delivers a much more compelling Eddie Brock than I was introduced to in the early 90s Spiderman TAS. Much more relatable. Since I was introduced to Venom through Spiderman, it was a tie I was expecting, but kinda glad they managed to make the movie stand out on its own.CGI and whatnot was all on point. Symbiants have a culture and direction, which was nice.I could probably rate it two stars higher if the ethical development wasn't so chaotic. How do you go from biting people's heads off haphazardly to saving the world in two short hours? If that really is the ethical spectrum, perhaps this should've been stretched into two or three seasons of television.And how does the snarky relationship coaching fit into such an animalistic ethical world view? Perhaps if we had 30 or 40 hours to work with, this line could be developed properly?Glad I watched it but wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's not already heavily into comic book movies.",Venom

415,gluonpaul,A film of two halves,6,3 October 2018,"So there are some strange conflicting pieces to this movie. The acting from Tom Hardy and Riz Ahmed was very good. I was a bit disappointed with Michelle Williams she has certainly done better work in the past but her acting wasnt terrible. The strange thing was that some of the supporting actors almost seemed like amateurs, stilted lines and little emotion. Very strange for a big blockbuster movie.The script was similar, on the one hand you had some funny lines, some interesting development of Brock as a lovable guy deep down but a bit of a loser. On the other hand some of the speeches they gave to Riz Ahmeds character were really poor and just provided no sense that this was a three dimensional character with their own motivations. It was like they were trying to make him out to be a Martin Shkreli character but really didnt capture the motivations.The action scenes were fine, there was some well choreographed scenes but they were not anything you wont have seen before. I think most disappointingly though was the fact that Venom is supposed to be the quintessential anti-hero, not good, just not really evil. That didnt come across at all. Overall this was a fine superhero movie, not a classic, not bad, perfectly enjoyable. You probably wont really remember it much in a few years though.",Venom

Apparently, many viewers will enjoy it under this belief and some (like my wife) forgot how it was even introduced in the Spider-Man movie. I saw it at a matinee and the wife liked it so it gets a passing grade from me, sigh....",Venom

419,RobLuvsTheMountains,entertaining and funny,10,10 February 2019,This was so entertaining and fun! Tom Hardy is very likable and funny here. If you didn't already know how talented he is you become convinced with this. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys humor and action.,Venom
420,jcallows,Exposing the Critics' Bias,9,1 December 2018,"Critics attacked Sony's Venom for its flaws while they excused Disney's The Last Jedi for the same flaws because they ""subverted expectations"". Why the hypocrisy? Admittedly, The Last Jedi was aesthetically better, but it was buried by a mountain of flaws. Venom was a much better overall film which easily overcame its flaws. Perhaps Sony should learn from Disney on how to pamper (i.e. Bribe) these paid critics. But I digress.Venom was Sony's answer to Deadpool. Though not as graphic as the R-rated Deadpool, Venom still succeeded with its cast, story and humor. Given the negative reviews by critics and my doubts that a movie about a blob from outer space could be any good, I had low expectations. But Venom easily won me over.Key to Venom's success was the performance of its lead actor Tom Hardy. In this fast-pace, action-filled, CGI-heavy film, Hardy managed to add realism to it in his grounded portrayal of Eddie Brock. His performance brought empathy and likability to his character. Caring about the protagonist is essential in any story, especially one that's been told before.Strengthening this film was the addition of Riz Ahmed (Nightcrawler and Rogue One). Ahmed is a talented actor who managed to turn what must've been meant to be a two-dimensional character into something more believable. Along with a strong cast, Venom had a clever script, a good story, and tense action sequences.There's even a catchy song by Eminem written specifically for Venom. This was a refreshing surprise. Up until this song, the closest thing we had to an original song for a Marvel film was The Foo Fighters' Walk for Thor in 2010. But that came from a previous album.The story might've seemed too familiar and might've reminded us of the cult-classic sci-fi film, The Hidden, or the more recent The Incredible Hulk, but Venom introduced enough new elements to justify its existence. And it would've been nice if the film had explained how Eddie Brock (and his girlfriend) could survive and co-exist with the symbiote while others could not. Also it would've been nice to see a more convincing explanation of Brock's quick transformation from a selfish, publicity hunter to a selfless humanitarian.Venom was refreshing change and a nice kick in the rear to the Marvel franchise. It's so good I didn't mind the cartoonish CGI Venom. But I would like to see this improved upon in the next film. I would also like to see the graphic violence turned up to Robocop level. I'd put Venom in the top 5 of all the Marvel films released this past decade.",Venom
421,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,We... are really surprised,7,17 October 2018,"There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie. Some of it was good, some of it was bad, but everyone wanted to see what Venom was going to look like. The first trailer was promising, mystic and dark, the second one was more lighthearted, showing us what exactly the movie was going to be like in the end. And it didn't disappoint.The critics are hating the movie, the audiences are loving it. And that is saying a lot. There is a lot wrong with this movie, a lot of things are not done as they should be done and most technical parts are not well made. Still, somehow, when put together, the movie miraculously functions. It's entertaining, funny in the right way, dark when it needs to be and dynamic when it needs to be. In the end, Venom is actually not a bad movie, regardless of what the critics are saying.But, credit has to be given to the critics for some points.1) The acting. Besides Tom Hardy who did a spectacular job everyone else is almost unnoticeable. The dynamic between Hardy and Venom is what keeps the movie going. How he executed the duality of Brock/Venom is perhaps the sole reason why this movie needs to be seen. Being capable of such a transformation in one movie is staggeringly good. The very idea that he will be exploring this dynamic further in the sequels really makes one excited. Unfortunately, his relation to other characters is almost non-existent (more on that later). He gave his heart and soul into portraying Brock and Venom and their relationship that he actually forgot to build a relationship with everyone else. Riz Ahmed is bland, without much point or meaning besides serving as a villain to the story. A shame because the character did have some interesting aspects. Williams was good as usual with all of her femininity and vulnerability combined perfectly with her strong and determined character mixed with a spot-on execution of dramatic lines. She and Hardy do share some scenes together and some chemistry is noticeable but, especially taking into account the importance of her character at some points the viewer is left feeling like much more could have been done with her character and especially regarding their relationship. Like this it is just left a little cliched.2) The script. Even though the movie has a very good flow, it's doesn't feel unnecessarily prolonged or dragged, the script needed more layers to the characters and story. It also lacks innovation and risk and in the end feels like just another origin story that we have, at this point, seen way too many times.3) The directing and editing. Almost no regrets at this point. The only thing that does at one point feel a bit clunky is the third and final act of the movie that simply comes out of nowhere. The first part is interestingly slow, the second is by far the most entertaining one, and the third shows all the grandeur of modern-day CGI. The only problem is it came way too fast and ended abruptly. I guess some segments were left at the editing floor.4) The music. The real shame of the movie. Up to the end credits and the Venom song there is actually nothing interesting or noteworthy for even a single whistle. That is a real shame for a superhero movie, and Venom deserved a specific tune.All in all, if one just reads these lines the conclusion would be that it is a mediocre to bad movie. Interestingly - it's not. It's a fun movie that you can watch over and over again, laugh at the same scenes over and over again, enjoy Hardy's stellar performance and wish it was part of the MCU. Venom is worth the watch. More than once.",Venom

426,rustonreviews,"A tedious, boring comic book film that wastes so much fantastic source material.",2,7 October 2018,"I distinctly remember seeing Venom for the first time in the 90's animated Spider-Man series. I still own the VHS of The Venom Saga, which was the 3 part storyline that introduced the black suit and Venom to the show. Venom quickly became my favourite comic book villain. I wore out the VHS (I still own it for pure nostalgia) and sought out further Venom stories to devour. First appearing at the very end of The Amazing Spider-Man #299 (with #300 being his first full story), Venom immediately became a fan favourite and has since featured in countless classic storylines that have cemented his iconic status in comic book history. Sam Raimi's troublesome (yet over-hated) Spider-Man 3 introduced the first live action Venom to the big screen, with mixed results to say the least. Following the announcement of a stand alone Venom film (without Spider-Man and separate from the MCU), the general response from fans was confusion. Spider-Man plays a crucial role in Venom's origin, so his exclusion from the film felt like a critical step in the wrong direction. Nevertheless, Spider-Man's absence from the film is the very least of its problems. Journalist Eddie Brock (Hardy) has hit rock bottom. Following his investigation into the secret experimental trials taking place within the shady Life Foundation, he swiftly loses both his job as well as his relationship with district attorney Anne Weying (Williams). However, Brock soon finds himself ""bonding"" with an alien symbiote from another world, forging an odd alliance with the alien parasite to become the malevolent beast Venom. Together they must put aside their differences to stop Carlton Drake (Ahmed), the charming yet psychopathic leader of the Life Foundation, who believes he can use the symbiotes to upgrade mankind into a superior species. Venom is a disaster. Nothing in the film works. The script is badly paced with scenes that feel completely rushed and lazily constructed, and the storyline feels painfully underdeveloped. It all feels very first draft, and all sense of character development is sorely lacking. Hardy struggles to convey a solid Eddie Brock and gives a strange and sometimes goofy performance that does the character no justice whatsoever, and Ahmed's Carlton Drake feels disappointingly one dimensional. The motivations behind his villain plans are never made clear, resulting in one of the least interesting comic book villains in some time. A fundamental lack of chemistry between Hardy and Williams weakens the film. I never bought into their relationship and felt as though it added very little, if nothing at all, to the overall storyline. Although Venom himself looks fantastic on screen, it takes too long for him to finally make an appearance. Weirdly, the film introduces a strange ""buddy comedy"" element to Brock's relationship with the symbiote, resulting in some pretty awkward forced humour that feels as though it was injected into the film for the sheer sake of it. Unfortunately, the action sequences are also dull and uninspiring, and even the final battle feels criminally anticlimactic.The bottom line with Venom is that it's boring. It doesn't try to tell a good story, nor is it interested in making a faithful adaptation. Audiences who aren't familiar with Venom or his classic comic book storylines may enjoy the film as dumb popcorn entertainment. For those invested in Venom as a character, don't bother. Venom is a tedious viewing experience that makes me wonder just how they could have got it so catastrophically wrong.",Venom

Michelle Williams was bland. I didn't care that she was fired or called off the wedding or....anything else. I cared more for the store owner lady than Anne.Riz Ahmed was a horrible (so-called) villain. He was more of an a$$ than a real villain. The only reason people listened to him is because of his vast amount of money.There were too many convenient coincidences. Brock, Anne and Drake just happens to be compatible hosts for the creatues, despite numerous failed attempts with others. Then, apparently a dog can be a temporary host...for the sake of a plot point. Drake just so happens to be the host for a big bad parasite. Anne's new boyfriend is a doctor. So on and so on.The goons sent by Drake were over the top. When you see several of your fellow goons being tossed around like rag dolls, by a seemingly unstoppable creature, you don't continue to fight the creature. Naturally, these guys did.The car/motorcycle chase was insane. Somehow, the cars were able to maneuver through the winding and narrow streets as easily as a motorcycle.If you simply go into this movie assuming it's a basic popcorn movie, you'll get what you expected.",Venom

I see Terminator, Carpenter, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles type influences in this production, crossed with state of the art CGI.

438,Ingrouille181,"Not a fail, but not enough to carry a new new cinematic universe",6,4 October 2018,"I saw the promos, the teaser, the other trailers. I wanted to see an R-rated, partially gritty and entertaining Venom movie by Sony, and I got half there, half in everything else. Tom Hardy is a great choice as Eddie Brock, whenever I think Venom, Hardy is the type of actor I would get as Brock, so we have that. But overall, these things let me down: Sony's CEO's turning their standalone Venom movie into a PG flick: unless it takes place in the Spiderverse, which it doesn't, why make it PG? Little kids aren't exactly gonna want to see a solo Venom movie, where he's talking about eating people. Why make it PG when underage kids won't even be able to buy a ticket to see it in the first place?Story is, a disgraced Eddie Brock is fired for a failed interview with business CEO Carlton Drake on illegal experimentation with newly discovered symbioses. Eddie accidentally joins with one, calling itself Venom. Together they defeat the symbiote before it's successful in (spoilers) bringing other symbiotes to earth, to help build a cinematic universe. Not the real reason, but knowing Sony's run by hack writers, that's basically it.The venom symbiote lended itself greatly to the Spiderman mythos: what do you with Venom without Spiderman. Not much. You either have him fighting other Spiderman villains, which would be slightly interesting, albeit disappointed since the viewers and fans would want Spiderman in it, or you have Venom facing off against Venom 2.0. There is little you can really do with venom WITHOUT Spiderman.I was watching the villain Carlton Drake the whole way through, and he was so by the numbers evil I was rolling my eyes. ""humans are a parasite, economic turmoil, famine: bringing a bunch of violent and deadly symbioses to earth will fix that, somehow"". I guess this would be the kind of writing for a villain you'd get from the screenwriter of fifty shades of grey. Also Michelle Williams' character was meh.As for the things I did like, the interactions between Eddie and Venom are good. I enjoyed how they worked off each other. I also really liked the look of Venom. The way Venom looked in Spider-Man 3 looked better for a Spiderman movie; the way it looked kinda slimy at first but then looked more like spider webbing later on when it was fused with Brock. This symbiotes in this Venom looked good, and even though at times it looked like a Playstation 2 graphic, it made me believe how they were able to make shields, swinging blades and flails at a moments notice. It was a good effect all around. One other tidbit I'd like to mention is that even though there are very few pieces of humour in this, they do a good job of knowing where to place them throughout the film.Overall though, Sony doesn't have a lot to work with now that (SPOILERS AGAIN) Riot's plan failed, and Brock seems OP by the end so any tension in the following instalments is lessened. Riz Ahmed did his job playing the villain, the villain on the other hand is a by the numbers villain, and his motivation is cliche; maybe they should have chosen another villain, or another scriptwriter. I'm giving it a 6 out of 10. Sony, perhaps instead of trying to make an ENTIRE new UNINSPIRED cinematic universe with ONE Spiderman villain, you could try it with the other unused Spiderman villains, make an ANTI-HERO franchise? Think outside the box, this is your chance to rival marvel now that DC screwed itself.",Venom
439,ty-jensen,Fun Marvel film,7,6 September 2021,"When I seen Venom in the cinema, I felt it was okay. After seeing some clips on YouTube, I figured maybe I was being too critical. I grabbed the Blu-ray when it was on sale and the film got better.Tom Hardy is delightfully over the top, he was passionate about the role since his son loves Venom. When the film came out, some critic actually compared Hardy to Jim Carrey in Liar Liar. The cast overall was fine, nobody else had juicy material. Maybe Riz Ahmed had two juicy scenes cut from the film. Anne is another generic love interest but she isn't a damsel in distress.Venom is a dark comedy, it doesn't take itself seriously. The humor works, I laughed a lot. I guess everyone liked the Brock/Venom dynamic regardless how they feel about the film.The story is okay, nothing special. Venom is intended to kickstart Sony's Marvel Universe but it doesn't feel that way. Venom is a small scale superhero film which feels like it was made around 2005. The film is short and fast paced but not too fast.The action scenes are fun, the motorcycle scene is the best. I understand why some fans feel the action scenes are cliche or workmanlike. Some fans were upset the film is PG-13 but the violence pushes the rating. Sony naturally wants Venom to crossover with Spider-Man.Overall, Venom is a fun Marvel film. Tom Hardy made the film fun, he was passionate. A better story or better villain would of been nice. Venom: Let There Be Carnage comes out next month, it should be better.",Venom

441,jimwt66,Decent movie,7,28 June 2019,"As others have said this is a decent movie. ""Professional"" critics need to die a quiet death. They may have been useful back before the internet but now when you can read hundreds or thousands of reviews on many different sites there is no need for critics. Plus, some critics review based on film school critiques. The audience does not care if they used some repeated technique. If it works is all the audience cares about. The other thing is that critics have their own likes and dislikes and they can think one movie is a turkey and the audience loves it. I know this is brought up way too much but remember E.T.? It was not well liked by critics but audiences loved it. Unless you find a critic that has the same exact tastes as you there is no point in reading them. Reading reviews of the masses gives you a better view.
This is not one of those where you are pumped when you leave but something that will keep you entertained. As an old school comic book reader I do have a hard time with Venom being a good guy. He had a lot of run in with Spiderman and I am guessing if they do a sequel Venom will have to part with his host to become the bad guy.It tried a little too hard to be funny and I think some of the ""jokes"" were geared towards a younger audience. It certainly was not Deadpool funny but the jokes were not horrible.

448,FilmChamp20,This isn't Venom at all,4,14 October 2021,"If you're a fan of the actual character Venom, you know, the monstrous villain to Spider-Man from comics and cartoons, then you'll hate this. This isn't venom at all. Not the story, not the origin, and not even the same character in personality. This is a funny buddy cop type anti hero movie with a character that borrows most of the looks from an actual established awesome character from Spider-Man's world.I can't stress this enough, this isn't Venom the cool alien villain who is a mockery of Spider-Man and one of his best villains. Venom shouldn't even exist without Spider-Man, not in name or looks. Venom's looks come from Spider-Man's looks. Everything about Venom comes from Spider-Man and the anger both the symboite and Eddie have towards Spider-Man. He isn't a good guy with stupid jokes. Venom is the combination of Eddie and the symboite, the name deriving from Spider-Man to challenge him. No Spider-Man origin of Venom gives venom no purpose. He's just a silly alien with a human body which allows him to form into a tangible monster. Eddie kinda just takes a back seat when the alien symboite takes over. They should work together as two beings forming into one being, that being is called Venom. This movie treats Venom like a friendly demon possessed Eddie and now they've become buddy roommates.This movie isn't remotely representative of the actual venom. It's like they made up a whole new character and borrowed venoms looks for the most part.I couldn't get past that aspect as it makes everything make no sense for venoms existence. However, if you know nothing about Venom or Spider-Man, you might like this movie. It's entertaining for sure, but even then, it isn't that great of a movie. Very mediocre.I'm a die hard Spider-Man fan and grew up living in the world of Spider-Man, he was my everything as a child. I loved venom as a character and he was so cool against Spider-Man. One of my favorite villains. This movie made a joke out of him. I want to see the actual venom in an actual Spider-Man origin film.This would be a somewhat fun movie if it wasn't suppose to be about Venom from Spider-man's world. I can't get passed the disappointment. Sad this movie will probably soon take over on what venom actually is and people will love Venom due to this movie, and not love the actual venom from the source material. Just more reshaping of characters and leaving the original ones to slowly fade away, watching as their name and looks are stolen to form a new version that loses the heart of what made them a character worth loving.",Venom

I really hope the sequel is darker, more violent, bloody, and gruesome since carnage will be in it, and he's WAY worse than venom is, a gore soaked venom vs carnage horror movie with nonstop action would be one for the ages, if you're reading this Sony, GO ALL OUT WITH THE SEQUEL OR DON'T DO IT AT ALL, WE DON'T WATERED DOWN CRAP MADE FOR CHILDREN ANYMORE, LEAVE THE DARK AND GORY STUFF FOR THE ADULTS",Venom

The movie felt rushed. Weak character development and story. Thankfully we won't be seeing anything more as the movie not only bombed at the theaters but afterwards as well.
One thing could have saved this movie and it wasn't there. All they had to do is go with the story of Eddie Brock in love with J. Jonah Jamison's daughter and had J. K. Simmons reprise his role.

455,Scarefish,Not Venominal by Any Means,1,13 December 2018,"So Tom Hardy quit Suicide Squad for this film? I mean, both are quite awful, but this one is hardly close to Tom Hardy's usual standards either.The film was obviously toned down to a PG-13 rating as a marketing ploy despite it butchering many of the more gruesome moments in the film and making the film seem awkward and stilted. There are several shots which are rather uncommon for PG-13 films such as injuries resulting in exposed bone and a short scene of bloody impalement, but other scenes feel tame in order to balance it out potentially to appease the MPAA.The villain was one of the worst I have ever seen in any of these superhero movies. He is a generic evil businessman whose whole motivation begins and stops at greed. With Marvel finally upping the ante and providing deep, thoughtful villains in recent years, it's a shame Columbia Pictures couldn't be bothered to put a bit of effort in to provide an interesting villain. He is not even intimidating in the least.The performances aside from Hardy's are atrocious, partly due to the poor writing. Dialogue comes off about as natural as a bunch of Cleverbots trying to communicate with each other. There's a part where Jenny Slate's character states her ex-employer was a bad guy because he kills people, which is exactly the way a 9 year old would word it. Other characters constantly spew character traits at our protagonist rather than the movie showing us how this character earns those traits. A guy literally says ""You're pretty dumb for a smart guy,"" early on in the film. Just a lot of basic rules of dialogue-writing are broken within the first 15 minutes of the film.The pacing is atrocious. Even as far as origin stories go, Venom grinds through at a snail's pace for the first half of the film. The beginning is bizarre and confusing with a bunch of weird sci-fi stuff blazing by at a blistering pace, and then the film stops dead in its tracks to eventually introduce us to our main character, Eddie, and essentially spends an hour giving us his life story. Tom Hardy tries his best to carry the film, offering emotional exchanges with his ex, but mostly the film meanders on and on with very little gain.This film is completely tone-deaf. On paper, it seems pretty clear what the film is attempting, as it isn't atypical for superhero films to combine elements from multiple genres, but this film seems unable to do more than one at a time with any finesse. The film starts by bouncing back and forth between a horror film and a dark and gritty drama, and then shifts to an action comedy rather abruptly about half-way through once the titular Venom shows up. There are occasional jokes within the first half of the film, but they are so few and far between and the tone is so relentlessly dour that it's simply inadequate to make the complete tonal shift half-way through anything less than completely baffling. The second half of the film is a significant improvement over the first half, but is by no means incredible and definitely doesn't make up for the first half for all but the most forgiving viewers. The 112 minute running time is a shocking slog as most superhero films are 2 and a half hours, and even Suicide Squad dragged less despite being ten minutes longer than Venom.There is never any suspense. There is no new ground tread at any point. This is a cookie-cutter superhero film that follows every beat of the formula with absolutely no shame in its creative bankruptcy. You know the hero's going to do heroic things, and then there's going to be a real low moment in which all hope seems lost, and then everything works out in the end as they defeat the villain and all go home for one final gag that leads into the credits and a post-credits scene which sets up another franchise.They should have made Venom a bigger part of this movie as he barely gets any screentime despite being the only interesting portion of the movie in the grand scheme of things. This film should have gone for more of a comical route like Deadpool did rather than start off super serious and depressing then suddenly shifting into a silly comedy half-way through. If you cut out an hour of flawed movie out of this and then redid a good half-hour, then this film could have had potential to be bearable. Unfortunately, it's a painful slog.",Venom

I try to go into every movie with low expectations, and simply look at them as a case of if it is entertaining - if not why not and if so, What marks it above the rest!VENOM starts as a slow burn in many respects - It teases action from teh start but actually does a lot to build charterer, However once it kicks into High Gear - YOU ARE IN FOR A RIGHT ROYAL ROMP!Would I have preferred to see a Spider-Man / Venom Story - Like the comics - ABSOLUTELY! But we have an Else-world Story that simply DOES WORK!Tom Hardy is BRILLIANT! There is little more that can be said... His performance is 100% on point except a couple of minor issues... But we will get to that....The film is overall Exciting and fun! And the characterisation of Venom is on point!Effects are Excellent - Except a couple of minor issues _ I would say Spoilers but its in the Trailer anyway... One point Eddie is on teh Ground and Venom takes over his body to attack a bad guy - And... WOW! The CGI as Venom covers Eddie Brock's face is POOR - The Rendering of Tom Hardy is SO LIFELESS!!! But thats Minor and it only stuck out to me as I was so invested in the film!Where I do take an issue - SONY YOU ARE COWARDS!!! This film could 100% have been better with a HARD R (18) Certificate.

457,Amadio,Average Marvel,5,3 October 2018,"Essentially, all Marvel stories are the same. Venom is nothing different. Slow introduction of characters (several of whom I find to be mis-cast), the ordinary guy becomes the 'hero' (SpiderMan infection thing), difficulties are faced and ultimately overcome.
What makes Venom at least tolerable is Tom Hardy. He has a depth and presence that compel the viewer and makes the comic light relief believable. Otherwise, Venom would really be less than average.
Good SFX, well-filmed, but overly long intro, rushed ending, poor casting and an unoriginal story line make Venom average at best. 
Sony wanted to make one for the kids - and they have.",Venom

1. Its impossible to make Tom hardy unattractive.2. It's easy to take one of the most promising comic series and ruin it with bad direction.What a waste of an opportunity. I'm hoping one day Spawn will be remade to its potential, will have to wait til I can see the latest instalment....until then I was hoping for more from Venom.The thing is I'm not even a comic book fan. I'm aware of the majority of them, I saw many of that which was pushed out in the late 90's early 00's but it's drab, uninspired cash grabs like this flick that pushed me far away from the comic scene with such jaded cynicism.In the end it was still enjoyable, good action, exaggerated CGI, pointless extremities at times.... But enjoyable.",Venom
459,bodhi-13262,"FLAWED, but still FUN:)",6,6 October 2018,"Ever since his live-action debut in 2007's 'Spider-Man 3', fans have been eagerly waiting for the character of Eddie Brock/Venom to be redeemed. Now that the infamous anti-hero has his own self-titled film, does it deliver and surpass its predecessor? 1. Though this is a SPOILER-FREE review, it should be mentioned that Spider-Man/Peter Parker is in no way involved in the story/overall plot. The film makes no mention or subtly implies any connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Tom Holland's version of the titular wall-crawler. The plot of 'VENOM' begins with the obtainment of extraterrestrial 'Symbiotes' by the shady 'LIFE' foundation and its CEO Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). Just like the comics, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is an investigative and cocky reporter with a nose for controversial stories, hence leading to his run-in with the LIFE foundation and the 'Venom' symbiote. The film has a relatively strong start and I was impressed by how much I was enjoying the build-up. Although you may have to wait approximately 45mins to see Venom's full appearance, everything leading up to that is still quite enjoyable.2. Considering how much of Venom's origin is derived from Spider-Man himself, the film actually found a way to have the character stand on his own two feet in a believable way. Despite there being some surprisingly funny moments, the overall script was in need of a ""punch-up"" re-write. It seems more effort was spent on the dialogue and banter between Eddie and Venom rather than the rest of characters. Riz Ahmend ends up being yet another generic ""mustache-twirling"" villain with an agenda that is never made clear and Michelle Williams (Anne Weying) serves very little to no real purpose other than being Eddie's former love interest that he still pines over, On the other hand, Jenny Slate (Dr. Skirth) does a better job with the material she has despite having minor screen-time. So not a terrible script, but nothing worth mentioning either. 3. Once we finally see Venom on screen, he looks fantastic. The CGI was cool and the design of the character appears like it was lifted directly from the comic-book pages. Tom Hardy also voices Venom and it is quite hilarious the way both he and Eddie have their back and forth. The biggest issue would not only be character motivations but the overall climax. As seen in the recent trailers, there are multiple symbiotes with varying agendas. This aspect is never fully explored and the film rushes past this to get to the action, which (unfortunately) falters during the climax. For one thing, the editing in this movie is completely choppy, especially during the symbiote fight at the end. The camera is too close to the characters fighting that its hard to tell who's who sometimes. Every action sequence prior was done so well that the climax ultimately was a huge let-down.'Venom' in no way deserves the harsh critiques from both IMDB nor Rotten Tomatoes, because it is truly better than what its being portrayed as. The film has flaws but (in some ways) the good outweighs the bad. Lower your expectations, leave your baggage at the door, give the film a chance, stick around for the fantastic post-credit scene and I guarantee you'll have an enjoyable time for the very least.",Venom

461,cliff_bd,Fun movie.....,10,20 October 2018,I loved VenomThe movie did start a little slow but then it had to build the back story and I still thought this was good.....but when the movie kicked into action it was roller coaster of action and fun.... there had been a number of movies of the years where the character hears a voice in his head. Not many of these type of movies appealed to me... but Venom pulled it off and it added to the humour.Could it have been darker? Yes of course...... but this is Hollywood for you!! What do you expect!I hope the sequels don't disappoint,Venom
462,ellimic,A brilliant film!,10,20 October 2018,"I saw Venom at the cinema today and thought it was a brilliant film; it had a good plot that turned a disliked Marvel villain into almost an anti-hero, and there were some good funny moments.The idea that Riot and Venom were only two of the four 'samples' returned to Earth, and that Riot revealed there were hundreds more like them on his world, hinted at the numerous Symbiotes in the Marvel comic books.It was a good twist to the story that Anne Weying allowed Venom to bond with her when Venom is separated from Eddie, transforming her into She-Venom, another Marvel comic book character.I hope theres a sequel in the future, which they did hint at with the appearance of Cletus Kasady (who in the Marvel Comic books is host to the Symbiote Carnage).I enjoy the Marvel Cinematic Universe but knew this was not considered part of that big collaboration (which was confirmed in the opening credits which had Marvels usual logo, not the new logo used in the latest MCU films with scenes from the previous films)
That said I think it would be worthy of the MCU, and being based in San Francisco when the MCU is primarily in New York it would not affect the MCU's storyline, but it could be a good future opponent for Spider-Man.There was a rumour before the films release of an appearance by Tom Holland (the MCU's Spider-Man) but after his 'destruction' at the end of Avengers Infinity War this would have just been too confusing so I'm glad it never happened.",Venom
463,achmoye,5 stars for the CGI,5,11 December 2018,"I love Tom Hardy. I really don't like superhero/vilains movies, but I had to watch this one because of Tom Hardy.Well, I guess a good actor is not enough to make a good movie.The buildup is really nice, we can see that the hero is kind of a coward, which is surprising for Tom Hardy. We learn about him and his character in a very simple, efficient way. I especially like the editing sequence showing his reporter skills.Anyway, he eventually gets in contact with the Venom, this alien thing with confusing intentions, and then the movie goes beyond ridiculous.First, characters take insane risks when the Venom clearly proved his dangerosity (talking chill in front of the clever Venom, just separeted by a glass window...)
But the character of Tom Hardy just vanishes when he gets the Venom.
It's just too powerful. It stops bullets, it fights everyone around him (yes, also behind him) so he is just a supermachine which will get whatever he wants. You can't make a story with a hero that facerolls on everything. He just has no challenges anymore. The fighting sequences are just plain and dumb.After a while, he has a discussion with the Venom, which explains his alien origins, and that he's been chosen (but why ? ) and the movie just doesn't make sense. I didn't read the comics, and I don't want to. It's ridiculous that the movie didn't make the job of being self-sufficient.Plus, the hero doesn't even control the Venom in any way (even if he makes some deal at the end), so as I said, the hero and his intentions are not relevant anymore, the scenario is gone, and you should be too.That being said, I love the visuals of the Venom parasite when it's free, it really has a special, fascinating texture. For same reasons, the combat between two Venoms in slow-motions contains an outstanding visual sequence, merging together but also tearing up, very special stuff.
But I don't buy Venom aspect on characters. It looks childish and laughable.I don't recommend. Visuals are not enough. The story is just weak.",Venom

He is down in the dumps for awhile until a symbiote by the name of Venom appears. The appearances begin slow, but gets progressively fast until you get to see Venom in half of each scene.I love Venom and Eddie's character and they may not be the best duo but they win the medal for the Most Comedic, Venom cracking a variety of jokes in between the calmer moments and Eddie resisting the urge to fight back.

468,Thekeybaldemasterrises,"It's like watching the Room, ""I feel like I'm sitting on an atomic bomb waiting for it to go off""!",5,5 October 2018,"Fool me once Sony shame on you. Fool me twice shame on you AGAIN! No no I actually wasn't excited for this movie at all. I thought Venom himself looked good in the trailers, but never did I think ""oh wow I think this movie will be good!"" I went into it thinking without Marvel, Sony can't make a Spider-Man movie to save their life. And yup, I was proven right. Here's the thing, I'm reviewing this movie in two different ways. The first as a movie, and then second, a comedy. I kid you not I had a really fun time watching Venom. It's such a fascinating movie to talk about. It's so bad I was practically crying from laughing so much. I probably ruined it for a lot of people in the theater but I couldn't help it. As a movie it does not work at all, it feels so dated. If you remember watching movies like Ben Affleck in Daredevil or Ang Lee's Hulk, it feels exactly like that. Cheesy editing complete with comic panel shots, nonsensical plot and pretty much no character development whatsoever. Tom Hardy is AWFUL as Eddie Brock. I don't know if he actually thinks that's how Americans act but he's just a bumbling buffoon who hunches over almost all the time. None of the supporting cast is given anything to do either. The bad guy is an Elon Musk looking stock character evil business man 101 who gets another Symbiote to just have a big Symbiote fight with Venom at the end. (This fight looks worse than Bay's Transformers movies I couldn't tell what was even happening I'm not kidding). Michelle Williams is here I think for the money? She had no chemistry with Tom Hardy either I did not believe they were engaged. Venom as a character is great but has practically one of the worst arcs I've ever seen in a superhero film. If you're hoping to get a really dark, gritty, edgy monster movie with Venom you can just throw all that out the window because that's what Sony basically did. However, if you want to see a really bad comedy that has some shining scenes with Eddie and Venom then I say you should absolutely watch Venom. Whenever they're on screen together I actually enjoyed it, they gave his character funny dialogue that kept me engaged and made me wish this Venom would interact with Tom Holland's Spidey soon. It seriously would've benefited the movie if they just had Tom Holland show up and make it a buddy road trip type film where they have to work together to achieve a goal. Aside from Eddie and Venom's relationship I couldn't salvage anything good. ""Venom"" is incoherent, poorly written, stupidly acted, it's a movie that falls flat on its face and you'll either think it's terrible or just comedy galore. As a movie: 3/10. As a comedy: 10/10 BABY!!🎊🎉

A main character that you actually felt and cared for. I think they made a fantastic job with a anti-hero that would be very difficult to put in a good light. Especially someone as bad as Venom.

Hardy is by far the BEST Venom on screen, his performance is an absolute joy and he really brings Venom back to life. The story is entertaining, and the beginning really does deliver a surprising, memorable character return onto the big screen, a ""Jameson III"" can be a hint from Spider-Man 2. The rest of the story is so good and makes Venom be who he's always been remembered as.I love the way the build-up, from a journalist-to a washed up man-to a alienated anti-hero Hardy delivers. He steals the show. He is the Eddie Brock/Venom fresh from the comics thanks to his own tremendous performance.Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake/Riot is not the best villain, it could of bought more of the antagonist onto the big screen. Riot isn't seen that much in the movie, an extra 20 minutes of Riot could of been really cool, and a longer battle could of made the movie surprisingly incredible to see, with Venom's story on the big screen. However, we still meet She-Venom (Anne Weying) played by Michelle Williams, who knocks off a stunning performance as Brock's ex-girlfriend.Venom is enjoyable, and it really does add the Venom vibe we've always wanted to see after Spider-Man 3's version.Great movie, go and see it!

Tom Hardy gives Venom the justice that the character deserves (unlike Topher Grace, who portrayed Venom in the worst kind of way.) 
They make Venom very creepy yet funny and I love the voice inside the head conversations that Eddie and Venom have. The way they portray the symbiotic side of things is awesome and I love how Eddie and Venom work together. They are both losers as Venom so hilariously states it. Venom talks in a creepy yet cool kind of way like the monster he is. Venom's villain, Riot was pretty cool but I went into this movie expecting Carnage to be the main villain. But he wasn't but that's fine (All I will say is wait till after the credits). It was pretty cool that Marvel and Sony branched off of the MCU for a bit and did kind of a back story.It was a great movie and I am going to see it again that's how good it was.

I cannot speak much about the VFX, but what i can speak of is the plot and narrative and the dialogues. It sure was an enjoyable experience. The plot was too fast paced and way less dark for an anti-hero film unlike Deadpool or Wolverine and some how dialogues, story development and ambience seemed familiar, like Amazing Spiderman franchisee hasn't been terminated.

The interaction between Eddie and Venom were quite funny at times.I also felt the movie was too short, having less than 2 hours duration which include the long end credit scenes.

So be sure not too leave your seats too soon.The sound effects with Dolby Atmos was awesome and it is also specialized for IMAX theaters. Overall it was quite fun and entertaining movie.

488,Toph-22,There is air upwards,6,30 December 2020,"Venom tells the story of Eddie Brock and the symbiont Venom. The two join together in the course of the movie and literally form a homogeneous mass. This process is staged very nicely. The way the two communicate, feel each other out and slowly learn to cooperate is extremely harmonic and makes you want more. The combination Tom Hardy and Venom fits like a glove. This is a highlight of the movie.The other characters remain flat for long stretches and are only sparsely lighted up. One of the biggest weaknesses of the movie is the run-of-the-mill villain. This is more than just one-dimensional and a really comprehensible motivation cannot be discerned either. Of course, the protagonist is the focus, but for me the antagonist is also an important part of such kind of movies.The framework story also has no real depth. You know relatively quickly what it all boils down to. If you look at the running time of the movie, most of it is used to build foundations which is basically good and definitely necessary. The showdown at the end is pushed through. The ratio doesn't seem coherent. It wouldn't have hurt the movie at all to be half an hour longer. More time to intensify the frame story, more time for the final showdown and more time to fill important secondary characters with life.Tom Hardy is the bright spot and Venom offers potential for a sequel. I would be up for it.",Venom

496,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,Not so terrible,7,20 October 2018,"Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock, a journalist who loses his job for questioning shady CEO Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) about his unethical experiments. He eventually gets approached by a woman who wants him to bring Drake down but one of the alien subjects merges itself to him taking over his body.The film was originally supposed to be aimed at a mature audience but the producers decided on a light 15 rating (PG-13 in US) to grab a wider audience. Though there are some dark scenes they are not as dark as they should have to been. Whenever something brutal happens the camera cuts away and it's usually in a dark environment where we can't see much.There are a few decent chase scenes, one throughout the streets of San Francisco and another in a laboratory where Brock (Hardy) is getting to grips with his strength. The acting is fine from everyone else, nothing memorable but fine. Riz Ahmed plays the cold, sinister villain but he's a little bit dull and just appears bored throughout.It takes a while to get going but once the venom attaches itself to Hardy it gets interesting from there. Also voicing Venom Tom Hardy is easily the best part of the film, he's good at the dramatic scenes and he's very funny when he's mentally wrestling with the alien. It does some grim stuff like chewing off the heads of its victims and mentally tormenting Brock. But once they get to understand each other there is actually some chemistry between them.Unfortunately it rushes its climax and some character motivations feel forced for the convenience of the plot. There are a few rough edges with it suffering from a few pacing issues, dumb moments and some poor editing, but it's nonetheless a good adaptation of the character.",Venom

But what was presented didn't seem like giving its all. I found most of the action to be pretty tepid (especially the motorcycle/car chase), not awful but lacking much ""oomph"" because Venom himself seemed underutilized, despite his abilities. The characters/acting were fine, but I honestly didn't think much of the humor worked. Not that it wasn't funny, but more awkwardly placed, further limiting the impact. There's also a lot of questionable plot devices/scenes that are just too baffling (a multi-million dollar facility apparently has no security cameras around its biggest secret?!)

504,Floki_Thorfinn,"Bad, but oddly entertaining",7,17 October 2018,"Sony Pictures had this great material and turned it into a catchy oddball parody of Spider-Man's arch enemy.To begin with, I don't know if Tom Hardy was a terrible miscast, or he hasn't the will to act more seriously, I mean, the actor himself has stated that wants an early retirement to enjoy his life, since he is work exhausted and this overload won't let him do it, so probably that must be flop number one.I'm not quite fond of comic books, never been actually, I do enjoy comic-based flicks though, and to my knowledge, Venom is an antagonist, therefore he's an enemy, therefore he's bad, right? And the worst thing about this adaptation portrays him as the hero, so, yeah, that kind of baffled me big time.But, as read in my review's headline, Venom is entertaining, I hardly got bored, though the humor was lame, I do recomend to give it a shot.",Venom

But my son really wanted to see it, so we went and, wow, I ended up really enjoying it!Yes, there is some awkward dialogue and the villain is underwhelming, however, I liked the other elements so much that those issues really didn't bother me.First off, Eddie Brock is super likable and relatable. Tom Hardy, who I've never been a fan of, knocked it out of the park with his performance of this character. I really felt for Eddie and was drawn into his plight. Though some have complained the beginning of the movie is too slow, Eddie Brock kept my interest the whole time.Secondly, everything about Venom is super cool. The struggle between Eddie and Venom and their argumentative banter made for both some delightful conflict and laugh-out-loud comedy. Yes, there were a few lines that were duds and made me roll my eyes, but overall I thought it was fantastic.Finally, the mix of action, horror, and comedy was done almost perfectly, in my opinion. This was a concern of mine, based on the reviews, but the flim makers pulled it off well.All in all, we left the theater excited and thrilled and can't wait to see Venom on the big screen again. Kudos to Sony and BOOOO to the critics!",Venom
508,maindraaritomo,I was expecting more,6,4 October 2018,"I don't see enough things to believe this movie deserves the word of succesfull solo filming Spider-Man's famous nemesis. 
Venom is so light and predictable. 100% remaking of Spider-Man's origin plot. No surprise at all.
Hardy is so bright on his dark appearance. It is not in MCU yet, is it? Keep off the fun, what they should have done. I remember first look of Venom shows Hardy was in agony scene. But last night Brock was totally fine, cute and healthy. Brock is not desperate enough to have no choice but accepting cooperation with the alien symbiote. I don't know if producer has few parts cut down, because I lost the moment of thrill I have been thinking about this Venom since its first trailer.
Everything is mediocre here.
I believe Venom's CGI should have been better than Spider-Man's.
I believe Brock should have been darker.
I believe Drake's hitmen should have been meaner and more sophisticated.
I believe director should have brought totally new stuffs. I see Hardy as the way he is, he acts, walks, talks. And Riz Ahmed, start knowing him as he stars many good films. Same as Hardy. He doesn't improvise enough to be a villain. Exactly same gesture and look as his other movies. Why not learning from Irfan Khan. We can see he is totally altering for each of his role.",Venom
509,smithpaulusmc,Back Story Ad Nauseum,4,9 October 2018,"Let me start assuring you, I am always a Tom Hardy fan. As a performer, he brings an uncommon realism to films that are lucky enough to have him. His voice is one of the most imitated among modern actors. He serves as a vocal chameleon. But I took issue with his latest movie Venom. The story was entertaining and I feel I got my money's worth. Yet, the plot was so riddled with holes that I could not help but feel a little insulted. In terms of character progression, Eddie Brock and hi symbiote counterpart develop too slowly at first and then assume a sudden change of heart. The film was 80 percent backstory, 10 percent climax, and 10 percent credits. At other times, it felt as though the screenwriter meant to be humorous while the director wanted a darker tale. Tom Hardy's voice also bounced around from soft Bane to squeaky New Yorker. Of course, it is only fair that I offer some advice to pair with my scrutiny. Venom's producers need to look at Deadpool for inspiration. Deadpool uses humor to such a degree that the audience laughingly overlooks plot holes and deus ex machina devices. Venom needs not take itself too seriously in the next installment.After all, I had a good time in the theatre. I likely would not pay to see it again, but I don't regret going in the first place.",Venom

For once, it's nice that a superhero movie is not trying to be another masterpiece but admitting it's flaws as they are, and building upon it. But it ultimately showcases why things change with it's extremely fast narrative which still feels unable to cover the whole thing in one line, instead what we get was a mashup of same things pounded over each other with everything repeated and predictable.I enjoyed the first half, and then was quite bored, as there was nothing except a plain obvious action extravaganza which is lackluster in front of bigger guys like MCU and even DC.",Venom

This movie has one of the best actor portraying Eddie Brock and Venom. It is amazing how Tom Hardy saved this whole movie with his acting!
The Symbiote looks OK, but their movement is really well made.
When Venom appears he looks OK, especially since Tom Hardy didn't wear anything that would help animate Venom.
Some jokes are good, some are bad. The jokes would have definitely been better if this movie had been R-rated.
Also Did I mention how good Tom Hardy is in this movie?The story was bland. Nothing new. Just some evil things that want to invade earth and destroy it, simple stuff.
Venom is a villain/anti-hero, but in this movie he is more like the hero, since he doesn't have an enemy that is equal to Venom, like Spider-man. I dislike how Venom was advertised as a movie starring a Villain, but it just feels like another Superhero origin story.
Most of the acting is OK at best (excluding Tom Hardy).
Writing is pretty poor as well, although sometimes it can be good, most of the time it doesn't make sense or some character's motivations don't make sense.There is a lot wrong with the movie, but Tom Hardy makes this movie just one of the best movies of the year!
Without Tom Hardy this movie would have been 3/10, but because of him this movie deserves an 8/10.",Venom

520,Here_2_Review,could have had so much potential....,2,27 May 2019,"This movie could have had so much potential with a MUCH better script and longer run time.... Venom is the type of anti-hero character that I can perfectly picture being an R rated horror-based character for adults. I originally gave this movie a 7/10, but after seeing Brightburn, a REAL anti-hero HORROR film, I realized that Brightburn was what Venom should have been....Brightburn is not a masterpiece, but a brilliant example of how an adult's anti-hero horror film show be. Just looking at the character Venom, you would think, ""Okay, no reason this guy shouldn't be R rated, tearing victims limb from limb in gory glory"". Even making Venom Pg13 was a mistake and wasted opportunity for what ppl have been asking for, for years. Many opportunities were missed throughout the years to make a proper anti-hero horror show.This Venom movie is way too poorly structured, cringe-worthy acting, pathetic dialogue, and even though Venom's design is how it should be, everything else is poor... Big mistake making this movie Pg13. After seeing Brightburn, I just stopped caring about Venom. I seriously hope Venom 2 will be good, but idk.Brightburn shows potential for a franchise of its own identity, completely separate from comics or novels. The concept of Brightburn is ""if Superman were evil"", but it's legit stuff that ppl have been curious about for years.The action is ok and visuals are really legit for the most part, but movie should have a different script, better casting (Hardy was the best part, but needed a better script handed to him), and R rating.",Venom

530,bradykitchen-33648,Good,6,6 June 2021,Venom has a lot of fun moments and the potential is huge but the direction holds it back.Tone: the tone of this is all over the place.

Tom Hardy does a great job and the relationship between venom and Eddie is a lot of funAction: solid action at times looked kind of poor but not enough to make a huge difference.

533,politicidal,Venom is a flawed but fun superhero movie that still feels like a first draft.,6,27 February 2019,"Tom Hardy kills it as the infamous Spider-Man character Eddie Brock aka Venom. It goes without saying that he's one of the better leading men working today. And without him, VENOM (2018) would almost certainly be a truly disastrous affair.From a storytelling perspective I'll concede it's not good. On the one hand, seeing a stand alone comic book movie is refreshing in this era of tie-ins and Easter eggs. But the script feels ten years out of date. The villain is just some shady businessman that gets the same powers and the setting is another generic urban landscape for Venom to smash up cars or jump off buildings.Yet strangely, because of Tom Hardy's commitment to the role, I was still along for the ride. Once the Venom symbiote enters the plot, the movie picks up steam and is enjoyable. Brock and the symbiote's banter is often funny and helps to liven up the picture.Riz Ahmed is game to play a hissable villain as Carlton Drake but the part feels too much like an Iron Man reject. Michelle Williams likewise seems like an odd fit for an offbeat superhero flick like this but she fares better. Some of her comic timing and reactions are funny to see.Even while I criticize the narrative, I see things that work or would be more interesting if the script was fleshed out proper. I read that a good chunk was cut out and they initially aimed for an R rating. That shows in a few of the action scenes. Speaking of which, the fight scenes are decent enough but could benefit from the splattery gore like the Deadpool movies.I was ready to hate this movie but I was surprised that I wound up enjoying it. It's certainly dumb and short of its potential. But it's a reminder that sometimes good casting makes all the difference.",Venom
534,pokedom,A diluted poison,5,8 October 2018,"Venom got me unreasonably hyped for a long period of time. I wanted nothing more for it to be unreasonably amazing, but it wasn't. It's not nearly as bad as I was expecting however, but a lot of people saying ""ignore the critics this was great"" are also wrong. It's just an average movie. It's a moderately flawed, yet moderately fun film that I enjoyed, but wish was much better than we what we got.We'll get the good stuff out of the way first with this one. Tom Hardy does a bunch of crazy stuff for a paycheck in this movie, which I loved. Even before he gets the symbiote he's so much fun to watch. He's half drunk and high for a good quarter of the movie, and then he gets the symbiote and goes on a rampage. I have nothing but respect for him after watching this, he was a blast from start to finish to watch.The Venom suit itself is not at all a bad effect. Of course you can tell it's fake but you never care about that. It has a good design and the first scene with the first transformation of it looks amazing, easily one of the most iconic moments from a superhero movie in recent years. This segways nicely into action scenes with the suit, they're all great. They pack a punch and because Venom is not concerned with killing people there's no worry of ""oh that guy is just knocked out"".Lastly I think this movie has some good humor sprinkled throughout. It's nothing groundbreaking but there's good stuff here and there to distract from Venom chomping people's heads off... and there's no... bodies...(abrupt transition into negatives now) Why wasn't this made to be an R rated movie? There is so much to gain by giving it said rating. Every scene would be improved in some way. Cursing that is sprinkled here and there could be expanded and not have to feel either forced or watered down. When Venom chomps a dude's head off I expect to see a headless corpse on the ground, instead they never show it. Venom bites 2 dude's heads off and the bodies aren't show, nor is the head in Venom's mouth. They don't even show blood for most of the movie, I think I remember one splash of it throughout the whole thing.A bigger problem would be this movie's undeniably awkward pacing. The first half of the movie, up until Tom Hardy gets to use the suit, is slow and lame (half lame, Tom's still a blast). Then when he gets the suit the movie rushes straight to the finish line, skipping key moments and opportunities for things. Venom's motives for saving earth change within minutes just so he could end the movie even faster. Riot puts up a somewhat cool fight but it's over too fast to enjoy fully. If you cut away useless parts from the first half and add to the second half as a balance, this could be so much better.While I praise Tom for being so great, the rest of the cast sucks. Generic love interest pulls a 5 second She-Venom cameo but that's all she does. Generic rich bad guy has the Riot suit but that's all he does. They're both awful acting wise as well. Everyone else is just plain lame. Generic evil goons, generic science people, generic cops, generic is a good way to describe things here.The movie constantly has lapses in normal logic. Generic rich bad guy asks how could someone escape with the suit, and who would do so. Does his facility not have cameras? Venom at the end gets burned by a giant explosion. He says he hates and fears fire earlier, calls it ""one of his Kryptonites"", which is precisely why after this explosion he's still around. Also on his list of weaknesses is sound. That explosion was loud right? It was also on a launching rocket. Rockets are really really loud correct? Either somethings not adding up or someone forgot.Venom is a strange case. I'm very happy to have seen it and enjoyed it, but I'm also a little let down by it. It's somehow better and worse than I was expecting. Guess that's fitting for a character as weird and as different as Venom. Doesn't make for a totally satisfying movie though. Go watch this one and see for yourself.",Venom

Some bits of the film produced some great laughs.. I expected more violence and horror to get the UK 15rating.. could have easily been a 12A..It was just a good film

542,jmalmsten,It's biggest crime was its forgettability... like most Sony comic book films.,4,18 October 2018,"Nothing about this film enticed me to watch it. Not the trailers, not the marketing, not even the buzz surrounding it as being a spectacular trainwreck... But I was bored. A few friends asked if I would join in. I said, ""what the hell...""... And three hours later (transportation to the film is included in that time estimate) the credits rolled and I felt about the same as when I went in.In short. The movie is a trainwreck. But it's not interesting enough to survive on that merit even. The actors try their damnedest and maybe at some time in history there was a great story here. There are remnants of interesting bits. But no threads are pulled on to get at any meat. Stuff happens and suddenly there's a climactic fight and then it's over.Sony has to do something about their popcorn film division. Sure they once in a while release some David Fincher thing but noone up there seems to have no idea what to do when they have potential. And the Spiderman debacle has been like a dying horse they've been prodding for decades now in hopes of getting something out of. And now they're trying to launch a franchise of Spiderman villains, but by contract they cannot use spiderman?In the end, Sony makes awesome hardware. But whenever I see its logo on a film I flinch... Because clearly there's noone steering that ship. Just a bunch of execs blindly turning the wheel...Some people seem to enjoy the butchered humor present here. But I just wanted the film to end.Btw...From the moment he Brock gets fired and dumped to the end of the film... Was that really all one long night or was that just how it was portrayed. ???",Venom
543,jessup-86446,Bland Hero Flick Masquerading as a Villain Story,4,9 October 2018,"I have little knowledge of the source material, but all the trailers were promoting a dark and gritty villain origin story.
As I sat in the theater and looked at my ticket, I soon realized two things: it was rated PG, and it was going to suck.
I experienced a spark of hope early on: when Eddie Brock is first infected and changing you almost experience the same kind of horror and revulsion you get from watching Jeff Goldblum's transformation in The Fly, but sadly it doesn't last as he and Venom very soon become straight up buddies.
On three separate occasions, Venom bites off someone's head, and each time the audience was meant to laugh, not scream, because that's how the scene was crafted.
The longer the movie went the less gravitas Venom gave off, until, towards the end, the villain role is filled by some under-developed character, leaving Venom playing the role of the hero for some stupid reason.
The whole thing falls flat on its face and I very nearly left the theater before the end because I just didn't care.4/10 Stars. Should/could have been rated R.",Venom

545,AnAverageNerd,A little bit naff,5,3 October 2020,"First and foremost, let's just admit Venom is a cool character and has one of the best looks in the superhero genre. However, this film falls short in achieving the full potential of the character. The main issue i have with this film is the poor attempts at humour throughout - if anything i feel it undoes the fear factor of venom and creates a goofy vibe throughout the entire film. The CGI also looks odd throughout and certain action sequences are let down due to this. Tom Hardy is a saving grace for this film and does his best to carry the film's plot and dialogue. Overall, i would argue this might be one to avoid; that being said if you're a fan of the venom character, Hardy and fancy an easy watch then it might be the one for you.",Venom

549,sagniknath,A somewhat boring movie that is somehow saved by the 2nd act and great perfomance by Tom Hardy,6,9 October 2018,"Long story short: This film came 12 years too late. A lot the dialogue, scenarios and character interactions feel extremely dated as if they belong to an early 2000s sci fi action movie . Even the CGI, while not bad, still looks like product of a bygone era (2005-2010)The first act was littered with early 2000s anachronisms : shady intelligent tech head with somewhat oscure motivations to rule the world, the scared scientist worker who wants to control her boss'dangerous ambitions; even a lousy metal head neighbor who needs to be straightened out Ala Catwoman(2004) style is set up. The third was no better as well. It was as if they now wanted the movie to end and made the climax as bland and generic as possible. However, underneath all this mess, Tom Hardy really delivers a good Venom/Eddie Brock performance. He was able to effectively pull off that Jekyll/Hyde dichotomy associated with his role. All the scenes that feature Eddie Brock interacting with Venom are interesting . The second act , which was all about Eddie finally acquiring the Venom form and getting caught in a city wide bike chase was definitely entertaining and gave me some hope for the movie after the sloppy 1st act. Also interesting to note is how different this movie could have been if it stuck to it's original R rating. There were definitely certain reshoots observed in the editing on account of some continuity errors. This was mainly to remove all that violent deaths from symbiote attacks to get the PG -13 rating. So instead of the camera looming on the death spectacle, it would transition to the expressions on the onlookers' faces. Overall, would recommend it ,despite being overall a mediocre film, based simply on Tom Hardy's performance",Venom
550,gwest-58160,Terribly written & directed.,4,7 October 2018,"It had a lot of potential. It's like a set up for a better sequel.

551,TYContact1,"Slow intro, but Venom-Hardy duo makes it worthwhile - part 2 should kick things up~",7,10 October 2018,"(^_^) This film would have fallen into superhero spin-off bargain bin without the smart-ass chemistry between Venom and Tom Hardy. (v_v) The chemistry between Michelle Williams and Hardy took a while to click, but the 2nd half was likeable.(v_v) With the little screen time given, Riz Ahmed (great performances in Night Crawler, The Night Of), Reid Scott (he was the good doctor in The Big C before he becomes the convincingly two-faced jerk in The Veep), and Jenny Slate (Zootopia, Gifted, Hotel Artemis) did a fine job breathing life into the characters (>_<) What dings the ratings is the choppy transition between horror, comic book heroics / thrill-rides, humour, romantic scenes, and social commentary (global warming, research ethics, poverty, crime, journalism) I hope Part 2 will do better(>_<) I don't notice how grainy the action scenes were (some viewers commented that they looked like retro movies), but I did find the night fight scenes hard to follow - especially the symbiotes were dark coloured to begin with(>_<) The first end credit scene was interesting because it was a sneak peak about which super villain will appear in Part 2. But the 2nd end credit scene didn't provide much info about Venom or the MCU - it felt more like an extra trailer promoting another upcoming spin-off movie in Spider-verse...I regret waiting for the 2nd end credit scene.",Venom

The elements in the movie, the comedy but dark factor just make it to +5 now... we are at 7/10. Michelle Williams is a PLUS and played her character really well. The Special Effects are A+.

556,jpolywog-52354,Oh Dear!,1,1 December 2018,I have no idea what Tom Hardy was thinking when he signed up for this movie. I understand that he may have been persuaded by his son who is a fan of 'Venom'..It just goes to prove that you should never listen to your children.If you enjoy special effects at the expense of good acting and an intelligent plot then this will be right up your street.When I say that the highlight for me was the brief cameo appearance by the late great Stan Lee then you will get my drift.I am always intrigued by the reviews which begin...'do not believe all the negative reviews'..this invariably suggests to me that I really should believe all the negative reviews.Maybe I should start a trend by commencing my review by saying 'do not believe all the positive reviews'..then again I may be accused of contradicting myself. Suffice to say that in my humble opinion this is one turkey of a film. Mind you it is the festive season. ..,Venom
557,TheJohnnyPHreak,Big Budget Midnight Movie,7,23 December 2018,"Let me lay this out straight because I know people are gonna jump on me for this review. I love Spider-Man. He's my second favorite superhero of all time (if you know me then you know a Man of Steel is number one). I know more about Spider-Man than I care to admit. Venom, outside of The Joker, is probably my favorite villain. (Yes I do know he's an antihero as well but he can be both) I was not on board with a Venom only film. I hate Spider-Man 3. Their portrayal of Venom is awful. (And how is that still the highest grossing Spider-Man film of all time worldwide?) Making a Venom film with no Spider-Man is just criminal. Sony wants to make sure to keep all the rights to the web-slinger in-house while they lend him out to the MCU. So here we are with a Venom film starring the always good Tom Hardy in the role of Eddie Brock.Like in sports where they talk about a tale of two halves, this is a tale of two movies. The first half of this film is dull. It's really only set up what we all know what will eventually happen. But it's not interesting. Eddie is a reporter in San Francisco with his own investigative show like Anderson Cooper 360. He had a wonderful girlfriend Anne (Michelle Williams) and a decent life. There is two at most mentions of his life in New York City at the Daily Bugle. Which is like the only thread to anything Spider-Man.I don't want to give too much but while asked to do an interview with billionaire head of The Life Foundation Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), Eddie stumbles upon something huge, that sends his life into chaos of the epic kind.Now, this eats up at least 40 minutes of the film. And it's not worth so much time taken to set all of this up. It would have been so much easier if the opening credits could have been the montage of Eddie's show. And splice in shots of him and Anne living together. This film benefited from Eddie already investigating The Life Foundation. Then from there get wild and follow Eddie when he first meets Venom and their interactions. Because when this film is the Eddie/Venom adventure, this film is so much fun and entertaining.As soon as Venom shows up, the second half of this film is everything I wanted in a real Venom movie. Hardy as Eddie is okay. Hardy as Eddie deal with Venom (also the voice of Venom) is hilariously fantastic. The film becomes this fun adventure, action fantasy with Eddie trying to control/get rid of/come to terms with Venom. When Venom speaks he's smart, he thoughtful and so funny. 90% of this film should have just been an adventure following Venom and Eddie. Michelle Williams does get some good moment but she's the only one. Riz Ahmed is the typical villain who thinks he's doing good. He brings nothing to the table and that part could have been played by anyone. Jenny Slate is wasted as a scientist working for the life foundation. When you have their talent, play to their strengths not making them cardboard cutouts.For the amount, I've crushed the film, the second half kind of makes it all up for me. Venom onscreen looks exactly like he should. He hulking, a beast of a creature and at times terrifying. Some of the FX work is shoddy (parts of the final battle) but for the most part, works. The action is fast paced and fun. The tone and look of the film does have the quality of the older Spider-Man 2000's films. I hope in the sequel they can make it look less dated.I loved this movie (especially the second half). It has its flaws, but I wasn't expecting something to blow me away. It did in a sense. Tom Hardy is great as Eddie/Venom. The action kept me on my toes. When Venom, the film has all of the fun brought back into it. What anyone expected from the trailer is exactly what is on screen. This is a midnight movie dressed up as a Sony/Marvel blockbuster. This is one of the few films I can see myself watching over and over. I only hope in the sequel they build on what worked so well in this...more Eddie/Venom, please!",Venom

It had potential for being fun and awesome. But it was no more than the typical Marvel disappointment.It wasn't poorly made in terms of budget or even acting, really - it's just a little shallow and boring. Tom Hardy is a quite unlikable character, and even when he gets Venom he can't pull it off. There is one well choreographed motorcycle scene though, and that's the reason for the three stars I gave it. And who on earth was Woody Harrelson supposed to be?My biggest question is how this Venom fits into 'Spider-Man 3.' 'Venom' is

What's more was that this film has possessed huge amount of murmur-ly conversations made it pointless and unexpectedly silly.I'm sorry but this film had almost zero characters and plots, and by how this film progressed through the movie, the story was just another version of Parasyte and many others earth-adapting-alien stereotypes in the past decades, with not enough energy and strength to make it fresh and new, the characters were underdeveloped, and the dynamics were not thick enough to hold the conflicts and the story.",Venom

569,kane_1371-117-231060,Venom is a fun movie that can be improved.,7,29 November 2018,"Venom is a very interesting film in my opinion.
It has had a success that the critics hate to see as they wish for another movie that I will review tonight had the same success and it is also a movie that is making a lot of heads turn as it has replaced so many fan favorites and even critic favorite super hero movies.
A movie about Venom, admittedly one of the lesser known villain/anti heroes of marvel's Spiderman stories has made a splash so big it has singlehandedly put an end to the California drought, it has made the Sahara bloom and sprout forests, it has made the ocean's level rise higher.
It is fair to say no one expected for this movie to make this big of a noise but it did, probably had to do with a really good premiere window, its biggest competition was a remake of a remake of a remake of a movie about a young amateur singer meeting an older established star, falling in love and reaching stardom, not exactly a blockbuster movie.So Venom had it pretty relaxed and now that it is all said and done the question is how good it was really was and in my opinion it was pretty good.
The movie is kind of short and might even feel rushed but it doesn't hang on unnecessary stuff, it decides what it wants to be and pursues that, it is violent but not graphic, it is funny but not comedic, it is action but not break neck. it finds a middle ground and nests in that spot and makes little babies that might sing even better than itself did when it first came to us.
The acting is your typical Hollywood super hero movie, there is no difference really in acting between this and any of the other recent marvel movies, it is chill, nonchalant, doesn't take it too seriously or hard, just wants to have fun and be done with it.
But the way the characters are built Tom Hardy ends up doing a pretty good job specially with the help of the Venom as a character, Venom is a lot of fun to listen to, he is pretty funny and absurd.
The camera work is fluid in general and easy to follow however the movie contains a lot of dark scenes and it can get hard to follow specially when you have Venom on screen a character that is covered in black too.
All in all I liked the movie and think a 6.5 to 7 is a pretty fair score for it",Venom
570,idanvinter123,Even worse than I thought!,1,6 October 2018,"I didn't even need the critics' opinion to know this movie sucks. The trailers looked horrendous with no potential whatsoever. I was even surprised Tom Hardy took the project, considering every movie he was in was at the very least good. Look, I went in knowing it's probably really bad, but I was HOPING for at least a few entertaining moments. Did I get it? NOPE.Not only does the plot barely make ANY SENSE, everything about this movie is awful. The music, the dialog, the directing, the acting, the editing... Just a complete mess. Most of the action scenes had way too many cuts, the music was absolute garbage and didn't fit the movie for a second, the humor was truly awful and some of it didn't even make any sense, the villain's plan didn't make any sense at all (just like the main plot), there are literally no characters you give any crap about (not to mention that Michelle Williams's character didn't even have any sort of arc at all!!).I'm actually not really surprised this movie was that horrible, I'm just surprised Tom Hardy took the project! Riz Ahmed is also very good, even though I only saw him at The Night Of. Michelle Williams is also such a fantastic actress, yet she's given so very little to work with because of that mess of a script.

Tom Hardy is just brilliant, totally believable as the down and out who inherits a new lease of life and new host inside him. There is immediate rapport between them with some real laugh out loud moments. He definitely understands comedic timing. 
Michelle Williams supports perfectly and is never over the top nor surplus to requirements. 
Riz Ahmed holds his own and comes off just with the right amount of 'bad'.
The action sequences are well done, often at night and deliver without over cooking it. 
Overall, two hours whizzes by and yes, the plot is not going to surprise you and you pretty much know what's coming, but the ride is well worth it in the end. Definitely a Marvel movie I would watch over and over and I can't say that for a lot of Marvel movies to be honest. Recommend! Don't believe the anyi-hype. Go see!",Venom
573,cinemawithcj,Venom - Cinema with CJ Review,4,1 December 2018,"Venom took me in a couple directions I wasn't expecting as I planned this review in my head. In what was initially a planned piece about the opposite of positive hype for a film - in which there would be discussion on how negative reviews had set up for a hilariously bad film that in reality didn't deliver - soon had to be scrapped the moment Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock comes into real contact with the titular Venom.The criticisms you may have heard are all correct. It feels like a superhero movie from 15 years ago. The effects - especially the symbiote sans human host - look goddamn 90s garbage. Tom Hardy once again showcases how tone-imperfect he is with a performance all over the shop.What you might have also seen however is also true: The film is fun. In all the ways it doesn't intend to be. Venom is so hilarious and so unintentionally brilliant that it's hard to despise. While a good first third of the film is full of boring setup, once we get to the meat of the film (if you can even call it that) you find it's just...stupid entertainment.Let it be known that Venom still isn't good, by any degree. It's a sin on the eyes and everything makes you wonder what the hell is going on. Whenever Venom and Eddie interact, however, is gold. It made myself go ""What *IS* this movie?!"" every. Single. Time. It made me want a buddy cop movie between the two. It made me want a romcom where Venom tries to help Eddie get back the girl. It made me want Venom being rehabilitated to the world of humans for an entire feature runtime.Basically, it made me want any movie other than this.There's something about a good bad film. Venom could have easily been another Suicide Squad. It could have easily been bland and forgettable like Fan4stic and...some other movie...But maybe Venom just knew the trainwreck it was becoming and leaned hard into that. I highly doubt there's a good cut or a serious cut out there (#releasethehardycut) but the 2/3 of the film that's hammy, hot trash has Hardy piloting a film right into the sun and I am there for it.Maybe Ruben Fleisher also thought this. Where he could have gone forgettable once again like Gangster Squad or 30 Minutes or Less again, he instead went Zombieland. It's still gonna be forgettable, but goddamn I can't say I had a bad time at the movies.Venom is a product of a different time with a different aptitude. It's recommended on pure funny hate watching alone, because you're not gonna get anything else.But did you expect anything good in the first place?Still, it's worth the trip because it's the best comedy out in weeks.",Venom

When the boss knows he is a journalist he always goes to the bottom of matters, and then his boss fires him and his girlfriend leaves him because they also fired her because of him, i mean if his ""girfriend""really loved him, it could have forgiven him, because the true love forgive everything right?Well and his ex-girlfriend is so bitch that few days later has a new boyfriend,wow that´s what i call a Bitch and the way in which Eddie and the scientist infiltrate the laboratories with shitty security is very stupid, the entired scene is stupid, a security guard ask to the scientist ""What are you doing here"" and she answer something stupid like science never rest"" o my God what a stupid phrase, and one more time the movie show us that the lab security sucks with a scene with Eddie breaking a glass of a maximum security cell with a fire extinguisher, and then Eddie gets the symbiote and we get scenes of Tom Hardy making fool of himself,then we get unnecessary action scenes and my God all the movie is stupid, a scene that I want to emphasize because it made me laugh is when Venom is is close to a plane in full flight and goes crazy because of the noise, because those who know Venom know that loud sounds affect it, in short the noise of an airplane usually generates 140 decibels, then venom is literally put down of a rocket that is about to take off and, do you know how many decibels a rocket generates? The answer is 190 decibels and Venom did not affect the noise a bit and that is like Whaaaaaahahahaat ?. Well I can understand that a little boy may like this movie, because when we were all little we had a movie that we loved to watch and when we grew up we realized that the movie is crap.

Hardy is without doubt one of the best character actors of this generation and I seriously doubt that I would have enjoyed this film as much with someone else in the role (btw thought he was miscast as Bane). As to the film itself I really enjoyed it apart from two issues. Firstly the motorbike chase was great but ruined by the attack drones. I know they're in vogue and newsworthy right now but they were ott and spoiled it for me. Secondly, not enough verbal interaction between Eddie and Venom, what there was was great and I wanted more especially when Hardy is so good at delivering the split personality deal. Support cast was good, female lead hot so all in all a film I enjoyed and looking forward to rewatching and hopeful sequel. Never read the comic iteration but suspect a good job was done.

577,songbirdmc,Eh,6,16 October 2018,"Maybe a little better than expected.I went to the drive in for a double feature and they were playing Venom and A Simple Favor together. Interesting combo, right? Venom was first. Let me preface this with I was curious about Venom, but it certainly isn't the type of movie I would go out of my way to see. In some ways it was exactly as I expected and in other ways it surpassed my expectations. Tom Hardy did a great job of playing Eddie, the lovable, and unwilling (at first) host to a very unusual looking alien with a sense of humor. My main complaint with this film is the too long action/fight/chase scenes. I found myself zoning out at times and getting bored during scenes that are supposed to get the adrenaline pumping. This happens a lot in films of this particular genre and I guess that's what the appeal is for most people. It's just lost on me. Too much going on to even know what you're looking at. Some of the humor is cheesy and too familiar. It's hard to explain. It just felt like a lot of it had already been done before, probably because it has been. Overall decent film. They even made me sad and teary eyed when we were momentarily made to believe Venom died. Yep they made me like Venom. Get ready for the sequel. They set it up in the credits. Of course.",Venom
578,pinemaples,A Bite With Some Venom,7,9 October 2018,"I enjoyed Venom. I really, really did. Tom Hardy is always a fun actor to watch, and while it's not his best performance, he does a good job here. Michelle Williams is great as always as Annie, and Riz Ahmed (who I loved in Nightcrawler and Rogue One) plays a decent villain in the form of millionaire, borderline mad scientist Carlton Drake. Director Ruben Fleischer had previously worked on Zombieland and Gangster Squad, and while those two were better movies, Venom is still very watchable.
I'll be honest. The plot itself doesn't make much sense in a lot of ways. There are huge inconsistencies with the way the symbiotes work with hosts, and how compatible the host can be. The movie is almost 2 hours long and still felt way too short and underdeveloped, with some holes where scenes were clearly cut out, either for runtime or to try to help keep it PG-13. There's also an entire scene from the end of the movie that appears in the trailer, which was really disappointing.
With that said, I loved the visuals in most of the fight scenes, especially the one at the end. The back-and-forth banter between Eddie and Venom was a sheer joy, and probably my favorite thing about the movie. There was a nice blink-and-miss-it cameo with John Jameson at the very beginning, and Spider fans will want to stick around for the mid-credits scene.
There's a lot wrong with this movie, and I feel it's a huge missed opportunity for them not to go for the R rating, as we've seen Logan and Deadpool 1 and 2 prove that they can succeed with flying colors. I sincerely hope they release an unrated extended cut when it hits DVD and Blu Ray. As it stands though, it may be a guilty pleasure, but Venom was generally very enjoyable.",Venom

I've seen when it's come into its footing, and I've also seen when it was struggling trying to find what can make the genre special. As the 2010s have brought some of the stronger and genre pushing films, Venom on the other hand brings forth the mediocrity I wish we abandoned in 2002.The film focuses on Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) as a hard boiled journalist who has reason to believe the Life Foundation is running illegal tests on humans with a alien being known as a ""symbiote"". After sneaking into the labs, one of the symbiote's attaches itself to Eddie and we realize that alien being is....Venom.The easiest thing to talk about is the first 40 minutes of the movie that every one agrees is the worst part of the movie and they are absolutely right. For a film that focuses on a head chewing alien, it spends entirely too long setting up the world around it in the most boring and uninteresting way possible. The movie forces you to care about Eddie and his ex-fiance, but there is NO chemistry between them whatsoever.Even when Venom attaches itself to Eddie, not only does it feel too little too late, it also is never as interesting as it should be. We never get to see Venom until almost an hour into this 110 minute movie and none of the action was worth the wait. The action is shoddily and dimly shot which is shocking given this was by a cinematographer I tend to like Matthew Libatique. It gets even worse when it gets into the finale which is a splash of CGI blobs being smashed together.There are many people who enjoyed Venom, and personally I'm not one of them. I never found Venom as an interesting anti-hero, but instead just a thing that exists for franchise money. The film obviously is missing 20 minutes of solid character development and the end credits sequence doesn't excite me for a sequel at all.

587,chasemykleby,"Every so often a bad movie comes along that you watch and when you get done watching it, you find out then you actually hated it and enjoyed it.",4,9 March 2019,"""Venom"" Review
(4/10)Every so often a bad movie comes along that you watch and when you get done watching it, you find out then you actually hated it and enjoyed it. Yeah so Venom is definitely this movie.
The movie has many flaws, such as the pacing is just absurd and the editing could have been much much better. The movie's first 20 minuets is a roller coaster. It starts out showing how the symbionts arrive on Earth and how one escapes, then the movie cuts to Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and his fiancé Anne (Michelle Williams). Eddie then goes to his job as a reporter and is tasked to interview Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), who is the CEO of Tesla, oh wait I mean The Life Foundation. The interview last 2 minutes, because Eddie asked why he is experimenting on people and killing them, which seems like the right thing to do, Eddie is thrown out and fired from his job. Then we cut to the escaped symbiont which kills like 20 people and then goes into this old lady, then we cut to black and we go forward 6 months! That is just an absurd amount of plot dumping in the first 20 minutes of the movie.
By the way the humans in this movie don't act like normal humans at all. Like insanity is the norm in this universe. They say superhero movies have a disregard for the laws of physics, but Venom has a disregard for the laws of human behaviour. In any given scene, its characters are prone to making such shoddy decisions that they barely resemble real people at all. Would you, for example, willingly allow an alien symbiote that looks like a sentient booger to latch itself onto you?
The films tone is also a god damn roller coaster that went off the tracks. Venom tries too hard to be edgy, but ends up feeling rather flat. The film's first half is heavy on the horror - an alien eats several human heads, after all - but if only the movie had the self-awareness to know that it's simply wasting its time with all the bloodless gore.
Hardy is clearly in a different movie altogether. The most important thing about ""Venom"" is that Tom Hardy does an incredible job. His character doesn't necessarily work or even make sense within the context of the film, but he undeniably gives an outstanding performance. Which is why I did end up somewhat enjoying this movie. Eddie and Venom have this very unique relationship and at times it can be funny and absurd, it's what makes it somewhat enjoyable.
If ""Venom"" was just slapstick and one-liners, an antidote to the over-seriousness of the ""dark comic book movie"" subgenre, it'd be a gas. If the entire movie was just Eddie and Venom talking to each other, I'd watch it many times. But it's not, it's just confused with what it wants to be.",Venom

591,dogmaticdogs,Better than the Critics Would Have You Believe,8,6 October 2018,"I wonder if all the hate is because Sony produced this film outside of the Marvel Studio universe because I actually found it very entertaining. There was a lot of action, and the special effects were very good. The movie theater was full, and many people were laughing out-loud and clapped after the movie. Yes, the main character was kind of corny, but I found Venom's human ego less corny than Iron Man or Captain America. I also found it refreshing that it occurred in a world that wasn't already occupied by other super heroes. It seemed more realistic and adult oriented than other marvel character movies, but I would have preferred it being a bit darker rather than light hearted.I am not a huge fan of super hero movies other than Dark Knight, but I really enjoyed this. It shouldn't win any awards, but if you like the genre, I found it better than most. The movie suggested that Tom Hardy was a loser before he became Venom.

595,metztex,Enteraining.,7,28 April 2019,"This movie started out irritating me by introducing the protagonist as an independent and overly free spirit individual that feels his way is the only way and he does not have to follow the rules. The first 15-25 mins of the film focuses on this in which he simply destroys his life and the life of his fiance. In process, he gets a cold dose of the reality of life. This also sets the main character up as good hearted individual who can't stands wrong but just does not know how to properly address them. He essentially comes off as a jerk and rather unlikable.After this drudgery, he and this alien life he comes into contact with slowly grow to realize their ""way of doing things"" can be useful if tempered with common sense and implemented at strategic points of opportunity. This was the entertaining part of the film and makes it worth watching. Additionally, this is a different take on one of the Spider Man villains which could lead to some interesting future interactions with each of these characters. The main question is if Columbia studios is willing to venture down that path.CGI, and other effects are top notch providing plenty of eye candy for the CGI geek. If you liked Spider Man, you may like this one as it does focus on a ""loser"" with a villainous alter-ego. If you like the Avengers chances are you will find this worth a watch if you have not seen it already. If you don't like the comic based films, then stay away.",Venom

There are so things that get this film wrong and right.For the wrong, the tone is completely inconsistent and all over the place. The film desperately tries to be gritty but turns to be a joke, and its attempt to blend in with sci-fi, superhero, and horror genres makes it convoluted and had a hard time seeking its identity. Even the CGI, editing, and pacing is laughably bad. The worst offender here had to be the script. From its clunky, bland and nonsensical plot to its terrible lines, dialogue and one-liners, it clearly shows the film's banality as well its toxic and venomous conditions.Even the most charismatic and respectable actors are wasted in this film. Riz Ahmed is horrendously miscast, and combined with his hammy, stale and mediocre acting. The fantastic Michelle Williams is given no favors despite her very best in giving her performance of Anne Weying with depth and conviction but ultimately falls flat and is even forced to deliver a weak dialogue and acting.On the other hand, here's what the film got right. Tom Hardy makes an excellent performance as Eddie Brock/Venom, which at least redeem its Venom portrayal from the horrendous Topher Grace performance of Venom in the terrible Spiderman 3. The dynamic and chemistry between Eddie Brock and Venom along with Hardy's performance are the only of the film's saving graces, but it's not enough to redeem this cyanide trainwreck.The most disappointing of the film itself is the PG-13 rating, which effectively weakens the quality overall and even restrains its character development from going to its darker characteristics, which this film could have gone better with an R rating, considering the success of rated R superhero films such as the Deadpool films and Logan.

It is also eminently watchable, thanks to Hardy's unhinged, balls-to-the-wall performance that would make Nicolas Cage proud. The messy script is maddeningly dumb and uneven, and you're left scratching your heads as to why such a high-calibre cast (Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed) would say yes to this clunker. If only it had the chutzpah to embrace its inner craziness fully, it could have been a bona fide future camp classic.",Venom
612,Kazombie,A huge letdown. From an honest reviewer,4,9 October 2018,"This movie had potential to be great. I say that because I have enjoyed most if not all Tom Hardy films in the past. This movie has a very engaging beginning. The first 55 minutes are very interesting and keep you engrossed.As soon as Brock turns in to Venom, that is when things start going downhill. It's as if the first hour of the movie was directed by a completely different director than the one who directed the second half. Riz Ahmad's Riot is laughable. The dialogue between Venom and Riot is cringe worthy. The final battle scene between the two is embarrassing.I really wanted to enjoy the film but the second half and ending of the film was pathetic. It goes hand in hand with DC's Suicide Squad albeit slightly worse.An honest reviewer",Venom
613,carobertson95,Lame,2,26 December 2018,Good cast. Terrible script and plot. The cgi was good but the fight scenes were very basic. Dialogue in the movie was cringe. I don't want to see another venom movie again. At this point just let Disney have him and put him in Spider-Man.,Venom
614,Andrew_Wiper,"Very fun, anti-hero Marvel film..Nods to The Thing, Cronenberg.",9,29 October 2018,"Fun, wacky, over the top violence and a brazenly mad performance from Tom Hardy make this a pleasing experience at the movies. At under 2 hours it doesn't overstay its welcome. Ruben Fleischer who directed Zombieland, takes the director's chair For Venom and like Zombieland, makes a movie that you go to to have a good ol' time at the cinema! It doesn't take itself too seriously, has many moments of humour, and also many scary scenes too. Very cool visual effects! Tom Hardy only adds to the movie's likeability, because he knows how to play a down to earth character, and a mad man at the same time. The director and producers, it was said were paying a lot of homage to Films of David Cronenberg and John Carpenter. I couldn't help but think of The Thing while watching this, and yes if you enjoy movies like The Thing, and the crazy body horror of David Cronenberg, you will no doubt enjoy this. Take that and add it into a marvel movie about a hero/anti-hero and you have Venom. Sure they could have made it R rated, but honestly it didn't really bother me that much. It seemed like they pushed the PG-13 rating as far as they could go with this. A definite theatre watch! 8.5/10",Venom
615,miss_jb,Become Alot of fun In the second act.,7,7 October 2018,"I don't know why critics is too harsh on this movie. I admit, the beginning is lackluster. I know they try to make sense why Eddie end up what makes who he is. But the setup is too formulaic, so watching formulaic setup bring less joy at first, I even want to quit from theatre. Then the fun is there when Eddie and Venom merge become one. From their banter, action scene involving them, heck even character surrounding them become alot more enjoyable and fun to watch. If they create sequel, I definitely will looking forward to it.",Venom
616,YouTubeblack,Average!,5,29 November 2018,"Well, after amazing spiderman series, its not a surprise to get such a movie from Sony.
Let's talk about the cast first. Tom hardy as venom is great! He just fits in the role pretty well.. But the supporting cast is not that good.
eddie brock's girlfriend or fiancé has zero chemistry with eddie, All the scenes with both of them are skkipable.
The villain, is so damn bland.. Its a casting disaster. If this movie had a good casting, then it would have shined.
The script is lame and predictable. It looks like an episode and not a movie.
The action is ok, considering the budget it could have been epic. A similar movie called update came out before venom and it had quite a similar scenario but it has a really good
Screenplay and action sequence.
I was expecting venom to be better than upgrade but pheww didn't happen.

621,Laiath,Leaves you wanting more!,7,4 October 2018,"I'm still in the theater waiting for the second after-credits scene as I write this, and I can safely say it was a fun ride. Tom Hardy was his awesome self sans the British accent (save for one moment when he says ""scared"" and the Brit can't be reigned in) and I loved it. The action, the humor, the plot, everything fell right into place and gave way to a very entertaining movie. If I have to mention any cons, it'd be the change of heart that Venom has toward the end that's not sufficiently explained. Can't tell what it is without spoilers, though, so I'm gonna leave it at that. Oh and CGI fights suck, but I liked the incorporation of the actors to the scene here!

622,Tiny T,So said it's not according to the comic,7,12 December 2020,"There probably a SPOILER ALERT. I'm a huge Spiderman fan and was a Spiderman comic collector since the 70-ties up till late eighties. So I know the comic story about Venom and his offspring like Carnage. I stopped before Carnage kid Toxin made his entrance and Spiderman's daughter May was introduced. However, it covered the whole introduction of Venom and the transition to Eddy and the 'birth' of carnage. So in that perspective this movie sucks. Pardon my French. And if you take the original story line into account, this could be a far more succesfull movie in the end. It would start with a separate movie where Spiderman teams up with Fantastic Four in the first secret space war 'Battleworld' were Spidy unknowingly host Venom back to earth. Here he discovers the symbiose which in the beginning suites him because he changes into Spiderman in a blink of an eye (the main appearance of the symbiont, also known as living suite, totally overlooked in the actual movie) and the webshooters seems to be imbedded. But due to the internal battle for control and the violent tendencies of the Symbiont he and mr. fantastic succeed in seperate them with the help of a new sonic weapon. As I recall correctly, the Symbiont manage to catch with Spidy again and in a fearful fight is separated again with help from a famouse belltower in America. There the first movie should stop with a cliffhanger and final shot of the symbiont falling in Eddy's lap who is knock-out in the room below the bell. Then this movie should be made which from that point is mire or less according to the original story. The detail that symbionts eat not only living flesh but also other hostile organism that threatens the host, the reason Venom cured Eddy of cancer in the comic story line. And you can link Eddy to Peter Parker as his bully from high school. The movie story line is entertaining in its own right and action scenes are up to the other Spidy movies.
I had the same issues with the Tom Holland Spiderman movies, which do not limit itself to the original story line of Spiderman at all. That is probably the same for all the other flicks in the Avengers movie series, but I cant tell for sure since Spiderman is my only Marvel guilty pleasure. Stan Lee is ok with this development since he makes his trademark cameo again. See what you think of it",Venom

I think they made a more rated R film and cut that stuff out. You'd be surprised in the lack of blood for a monster that chomps off heads. There is literally only two sequences with blood. Now would blood make it better I don't know. (I would have enjoyed that though) So overall it's pretty decent.",Venom

629,firefox2k,An Anti-hero movie for the rest of us,6,6 October 2018,"This public service announcement is being provided for those viewers who have a hard time of letting go things they think they ""know"". One of those things is that ""You can not do a Venom movie without Spider-man!"". I am here to tell THOSE people, you are WRONG!
As those people are no doubting shouting profanities at my review right now, they have not considered that I went into this movie knowing NOTHING about Venom, Spider-man, Eddie Brock, Symbiotes, or how Venom came to be in the comics. 
This part here is the actual review.
The movie was good. Not bad, but not good. Think of early/mid 90's super-hero films. (Ang Lee's Hulk, Batman Forever).
The good parts about the movie is that Tom Hardy gave an excellent performance in this role as he has done in so many films. He really put effort in this movie and did as best as he could with what he was given. 
The relationship between Venom and Brock worked well to the point of you understand why Sony took a gamble on this movie. It actually makes you hope that Sony decides to extend the character to other movies.
The bad: This movie felt like it was filmed in scenes, seriously. All movies are filmed out of order and assembled together, however the ideal is for you as the viewer to watch the movie from start to finish in a complete nature. However when watching this film all you can see is scene/cut/next scene. Like a puzzle being put together. Also the relationship aspect in the movie was crow-bared in, to which it should have been left out. 
If you go see this movie, do your best to view it as I did. Forget the Venom you know in the comics or in previous tv shows. Just try to see the version in the movie, and you might have an enjoyable time. 
Please, like all Marvel movies, do stay for the 2 after movie scenes. 1 comes mid credit and one at the end of the movie.",Venom

631,mimosveta,I've stopped watching movies because of titles such as this,2,14 September 2019,"The only reason I tried watching this, was Hardy. He's kinda fun. And I've read somewhere he looks like crap throughout entire movie, so I thought who knows, maybe it's not your typical hollywood mess.Boy, it was a mistake. The entire movie is hard to look at. For starters, CGI. CGI always looks bad. At this point I don't even think it can be made better. Whatever is done with CGI will always look plastic and just bad and fake. Then there's Williams. She might as well be CGI herself, she just looks grating. In fact, the only thing movie has going for it, is that it feels like only half an hour watch. I mean, basically nothing happens anyway, there's no progression, when the thing decides it likes humans, it tells you so, nothing happened so that you might come to that conclusion your self. And it couldn't have, since movie is so short. Well, not really short, but feels short.Still, how short it feels is not the reason I gave it another star. There were actually two good jokes there. I don't remember when was the last time hollywood movie made me giggle, so there. Two stars for two jokes.",Venom
632,kooldddon,An absolute disappointment and a mindless entertainer of sorts.,5,5 October 2018,"I was so psyched for this movie when it was announced and the first trailer hit us. One of the most amazing comic book characters, I was excited to see Venom once again on the big screen. Add to that Tom Hardy playing the titular role. Sony pictures had it sold to me completely. But all expectations came crashing down once the 112 minutes of the movie run time was over.The movie has the most simplest and basic plot line. Add to that no good side characters and patchy writing throughout. The only two good things about the movie were Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and the symbiote Venom also voiced by Hardy. Venom does not even appear until the one hour mark and that will lit your eyes up in anticipation and you will get an orgasm of a sort. Trust me. Whenever Venom is on screen the movie just becomes amazing just by his presence and his dialogues. Tom Hardy is exceptional as Eddie and Venom but he is tied down by the patchy writing and did his best with what he was given. Hardy has gone on record and said that they cut his favorite 40 mins from the movie. Add to that Sony going for the PG-13 rating rather than R didn't help the cause. I'm sure a R rated movie would have served a movie and character like Venom in a much better way. It just baffles me how the studios are seeing only kids as their audience and are neglecting the majority crowd who have grown up reading these comics and are well over 20 years now. But that is a different rant for a different time.Coming back to the movie, the visual effects are on point. The depiction of character of Venom and Riot is so amazing. So good job on that front. But the movie seems grossly underdeveloped, lacks depth in all departments and has zero character development. Every other character is a complete waste and reeks of lazy writing. The villain is the worst of all. Although still, this movie has it's fanboy moments. Eddie's and Venom's sarcastic comedy makes the movie worthy of one watch at least. They had sizzling chemistry which could have taken the movie to new heights but the overall writing just let's it down. Venom is a lazy movie and I wish they had put in more effort. *SPOILER ALERT*

So I will just tell you what I thought about the movie, in a one off sense.The Venom character, he's certainly a really strong hero/anti hero, he's up there with the most capable of super heroes. The acting, it's good, it is about what you would expect from top actors, when working on a super hero movie.I am already looking forward to the sequel. I would like to see this character grow, then eventually joining to the ""Marvel Universe"", in some capacity at least. I do feel that this Venom guy would make a great TV series. Marvel are doing some great work with their series format. I'm really enjoying their TV shows. Having said that, the Marvel team, I feel, are certainly going to need to go all out, in creating some bad guys for Venom to go up against.I hope Tom Hardy stays on board. He is one of the few ""tough guy"" actors, around, that doesn't leave you with an impression of - some guy who spends all week in a gym, whilst adoring the mirror.If you are a fan of these type of movies, then you'll know not to expect Oscar worthy type stuff.

when it comes to the story it was so plain but it didn't disturb me and also villain was so cliche and secondary characters were quite ordinary.
On the other hand Tom hardy's portrayal of venom was so good and I think his performance carried the movie, if it would be an R rated movie , it could have been more successful, who knows? also I liked interaction between Eddie Brock and Venom I wish there could be more.

652,felix-wyderka,An utter crap fest that is boring and disappointing,4,9 October 2018,"When I went to see this movie I was worried I might waste time and alas I cannot easy your mind a little. The movie is just as bad as many critics have been reporting.
Before I start I want to say that the only the reason I gave the movie a more than three-out-of-ten rating are considerable acting efforts of Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed who raise the movie's quality from completely unwatchable to at least a little entertaining.
I believe we have been spoiled by Marvel with many great movies over the years. This one is a certain misfire. It lacks the stability and excitement we usually find in a Marvel production and it mostly lives off of it's great acting performances. 
The movie starts with a scene of a crashing space ship. On board this space ship are the so called ""Symbionites"" (which by the terms definition is wrong). These creatures search a host and essentially connect with them so they can survive. 
That is exactly what happens to investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy). The Symbiote connecting to him is called Venom and once the two find each other the wreaking havoc starts. 
This is a very short description of the plot of the movie and basically that is all that you have to know. There is rarely something exciting happening in Venom. 
Before we get to the aforementioned connection between man and alien we have to wait a bout an hour. Before that there is a fairly boring plot that explains next to nothing about the creatures or the reason they are on earth. 
Unfortunately the second hour is not much more interesting than the first one. 
There a few well made scenes when Eddie fights the bad guys from the so called Life Coporation. But that is most of the action you get. 
This year we have seen a few action with many great chases. The best by far is the motorcycle chase in Mission Impossible: Fallout. There is a motorcycle chase in the second half of the movie as well but is so dull it make Tom Cruise cry in shame.
A thing that Marvel usually does particularly well is choosing their villains. This time however it was a swing and a miss. 
While Riz Ahemds villain Carlton Drake is a complete ass he is neither threatening nor scary. In most Marvel movies while you can relate to the villain you still hate them. This is not the case here mostly due to the fact that Venom is a kind of villain himself and seems ay more threatening than Drake.
While the action scenes are a positive aspect of the movie there is one in particular that fails to hold up the standard.
In the end of the movie, when Venom fights another Symbionite, the fight is utterly boring. I have never seen a fight in a movie as bad as this one in all my life. 
Apart from the scene just taking three minutes, instead of the usual ten, there also is a total lack of creativity. Often in this kind of movies the final fight sequence offers us some creative new ways to make the scene more exciting. This is not the case here. The two participants just hit each other a few times and then before the fight even really started it is done. It simply was a complete disappointment. 
The thing that surprised me the most however was the lack of humor in this movie. Granted Venom is a dark character and it hard to laugh about man-eating, parasitic alien that threatens to wipe out humanity but usually Marvel still managed to make the audience chuckle. In Venom there is a complete lack of humor and when the movie tries to be funny it usually just feels more awkward than funny.
But luckily Venom isn't all bad. There were some good choices that Marvel made. 
Those choices were mostly made in the casting department. 
Hiring three respected and popular actors was a good choice. 
The most exciting performance in the movie was of course the one by Michelle Williams. She is a widely under appreciated actress and one of the best of our time. I cannot remember the last time she had to work so hard to make her character likable and authentic. But nevertheless she does it perfectly. 
Williams had a difficult job making an utterly uninteresting character interesting enough so we care about her. She managed to hold her ground against a totally screwed up script and steals every scene she's in. 
Riz Ahmed had it a little easier. While his bad guy Carlton Drake is not as threatening and unlikable as he should have been Ahmed still manages to bring out the ass persona in the character. 
Other than his two co-stars Hardy seems lost in the role. But while he does his best in this thankless role what he does is neither here nor there and his talent is wasted in this film. We get flashes of his considerable acting skills in the beginning of the movie but the longer the movie goes the more lost and bored Hardy seems to be. 
One thing that I was pleasantly surprised about was some of the production design. The Life Corporation head quarters were designed with precision and an idea. They look so authentic that one might think the set actually existed somewhere in the world. 
I also enjoyed some beautiful shots of the San Francisco skyline and harbor. 
In conclusion I must say that Venom is a complete crap fest that makes too many bad choices for it to be a good movie. If you plan to spend money on seeing it, I strongly advise you not top do it. It's not worth it. This one of those movies that you will catch on cable some day and that you will forget about as soon as you leave the couch.",Venom
653,jonesbrooke123,"You can love a character, but not like the movie",3,14 October 2018,"The movie had an interesting aesthetic and great animation for the symbiotes. But with some positives comes a few negatives. This movie had such poorly written dialogue and character building. The banter between Eddie and Venom seemed like it was written by a 12 year old trying to be edgy. Usually Tom Hardy is a pretty okay actor, but at times I couldn't understand what he was saying. I saw this movie twice in hopes of it changing my opinions and and to gauge the audience, but it did nothing other than show me that a lot of people laughed at moments that weren't supposed to be funny. I think Venom is a great character, but I don't this movie properly told to origin of the symbiote. I hope in the future we get a better, more R rated movie. A PG-13 will never do the story or characters justice.",Venom

661,bobandlulureview,"Venom: So many snacks, so little time...",8,10 October 2018,"Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock has done an excellent job of portraying a man taken by a parasite - a parasite that has a mind of its own. The movie begins with an introduction to Eddie Brock and the nature of his work as a reporter and you know he is ""all in"" where his work is concerned. He will go any lengths to get his scoop, even sneak into his loved ones emails.
Of course, he gets his scoop but along with that he also loses his job, apartment and girlfriend. Yet, there he is right outside a store paying $20 for a newspaper that is free.
Parallely symbiotes have made their way to our planet via the Life Foundation Space Craft. The Craft crash lands in Malaysia and an emergency team reaches the spot to ensure that there aren't too many causalities. The team finds the symbiotes that are captured and an astronaut who is barely alive. But not really... one of the symbiotes escapes and manages to wreak a RIOT. While riot ensues, scream, agony and venom make it to the Life Foundation Lab in San Francisco. As the name suggests symbiotes need a host and LFL begins experiments with animals. The moment there is a spark of success; Drake wants to begin working with human specimens.
Carlton Drake played by Riz Ahmed is the CEO of the Life Foundation. He is a young man who isn't just possessed by the need to succeed but clearly suffers from a severe case of hypermetropia induced by megalomaniacal tendencies. This though has been evident all along. His scientists continue their pursuit of greater good until the experiments begin on humans and it results in a moral dilemma for one of his scientists.
Reporter Eddie Brock finds himself in the LFL at the behest of the whistle blower, only to find himself hosting Venom.
What happens next is a ton of action, a thrilling chase sequence, hot flushes and cold sweat that makes one sit in an aquarium in the middle of a restaurant and eat a live lobster. (It could have been a cray fish, correct me if I'm wrong.) Now, for those with a weak stomach - be warned, there are more such barf inducing scenes from the very beginning of the movie. My friend and I had no problems as we sat eating popcorn and sipping Coke while heads vanished and faces were being licked. *Slurp*.
The movie progresses beautifully and it is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed. The movie is fast paced, the story is rushed but if you are attentive, you'll know and understand what's happening. If you have read the comics good for you and like me if you haven't read them, go along with someone who has, like I did.
After watching this movie, one thing is clear, Anti-Heroes are here to stay. Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, Jenny Slate, Scott Haze and Reid Scott have all managed to makes us, love, admire, hate, like, hate and amuse throughout the movie.
The movie does have a ""buddy cop"" feel to it with several laughs along the way. Some terrible jokes don't quite make the mark but for the most part the jokes are actually funny. I especially loved Venom-Eddie interaction.
I am now looking forward to the Eddie - Venom - Anne love triangle in the sequel!!! Yes, there is definitely going to be a sequel. For those making plans to watch the movie, stay back for the scene before the credits roll and for the sneak-peak post credits.P.S: Yes, Stan Lee does make an appearance. My Recommendation: Don't go by what the critics have to say, if you really want to sit back and unwind go for this movie.",Venom

Not much by way of plot holes, nonsense, and convoluted action compared to Bay or the other MCU stuff. I enjoyed it, because of the pace it could be rewatched too.

It was small things but still refreshing not to predict every scene coming up.Tom Hardy was made for this role, really can't imagine it with anyone else. Definitely a film I'd say you need to watch for yourself.",Venom
671,jadongarcia,It could have been better,7,9 March 2019,"2018's 'Venom' was overall a great film. It wasn't perfect but it definitely needs a sequel and it was almost as perfect as I expected it to be.The visual effects were better than I expected, definitely better than 2007's Spider-Man 3 Venom. The CGI was so crystal clear on venom's dark and moist body that I was able to see everything from the detailed and very clean black color, to the perfect shine on his body, including his white veins which in my opinion definitely sealed the deal on the effects as a whole, same goes for the other symbiotes in the film like riot, etc.Tom hardy's performance was pretty average, a bit basic in my opinion, It kind of reminded me of the mental breakdown scene with Shia LaBeouf's 'Sam Witwicky' from the 2009 Transformers film 'Revenge of the Fallen'. When Tom Hardy did the voice of Venom it sounded so intimidating in theaters, definitely a great experience and performance(as venom not eddie).The action was great but a bit of a letdown considering it was originally going to be R-rated. I would have loved to see Venom bite people's heads off, we as a geek audience that crave that gore from for example, Hugh Jackman's Logan or Watchmen, we love that explicit content to show the full extent of how brutal these characters can truly be. Furthermore, it would have featured much more with an R-rating.Now finally the plot. It was honestly pretty average. The romance was extremely basic and formulaic, his fiancee basically left him but he'll win her back in the end. The villain was a pretty big letdown, performance-wise, typical evil persona for no particular reason, Riot on the other hand was great, Riz Ahmed is a fairly decent actor but for Riot, it could have been someone else with a more aggressive attitude, more douchy basically. The idea of other symbiotes invading the planet was pretty interesting, I would love to know the backstory behind where symbiotes came from, where they originated and why their weakness is eerie screeching noises. I loved that.Overall, great film, definitely recommend it for the action and visuals, Venom got more screen time than expected since there was a rumor that he would only get 5 minutes of screen time. I'm definitely anticipating a sequel with a bit of a weird casting choice of Woody Harrelson, but I'll take my chances.",Venom
672,northfacingphotography,Critics might make tasty treats,8,8 October 2018,"I was unsure of how a PG-13 version of Venom would work. I would have liked it R rated. I would have hated not being able to take my son as he has loved Venom since he was old enough to know about Spider-Man. He was stoked and I was excited. It was fun. Tom Hardy was a great cast. It was a little formulaic in its script, but what isn't anymore. I can say that waiting for the post-credit scene is worth it for those already initiated in this world. Go see and enjoy.",Venom

674,ahsawesa,Not Worth Your Money,4,8 October 2018,"Film Review: Venom (NO SPOILERS)I'll skip going over the premise because everyone knows what it's aboutThis movie was really that bad. I mean it's not a Batman and Robin kinda bad but it is just a passable unnecessary film.I heard a lot of people were saying this film isn't as bad as critics said it is but I ended up agreeing with what the critics said.I didn't find any redeeming quality in it. This film wastes too much time to establish what it needs to. They spend nearly an hour going over stuff that could have been over with in the opening fifteen to twenty minutes.There's too much of Eddie Brock and too less of Venom. I found Eddie Brock to be a very one dimensional paper thin protagonist. Tom Hardy was just OKAY in terms of acting. I don't know why people are praising him so much.Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed are totally miscast in their roles. Not only that, their characters are very one dimensional too. All characters in this film are one dimensional except for the Venom symbiote itself which was intriguing and had a few funny lines.There are lot of unnecessary cringe-y attempts at comedy in this film. The only time it was kinda working was when Eddie and Venom had a conversation. The comedic tone clashed with the supposed dark tone of the film. Tonally, this was a mess. What is this film trying to be? A nicolas cage style comedy? A dark and gritty monster film?. It just ended up being a generic #1000 blockbuster action film you'd usually see The Rock in minus Rock's charisma.A generic story is no problem if you can find new ways of telling your story. Venom follows the same pattern you'd see in any origin story except it takes too long before anything interesting happens and when something remotely interesting occurs, you realize the film is about to endThe action scenes felt incoherent and hard to follow at times. And if you have seen the clips and the trailers, you have seen pretty much all the decent sequences.By the time I got near the end, I realized at least there's at least a CGI filled finale which is always cool to see but who gives the damn when the rest of the film does a piss poor job of building up to it. And the ending was very quick and abrupt.This was a very unnecessary quick cash grab by Sony. Venom is a cool bad ass character and his dynamic with Eddie is interesting but Eddie himself is very dull.It sets up a sequel and I kinda want to see the sequel instead of this film. I honestly think they should have avoided doing an origin story when it's this simple. We didn't need this film. It was totally unnecessary and forgettable. They should have followed whatever they are gonna do in the sequel for part one instead of making this film.If you were looking forward to this film, maybe you should see it instead of letting my review ruin your anticipation but this is my opinion on the film. But I don't think this film is worth your money. You deserve better. I don't know what people saw in this film that made some people say ""It is really good"" but if you liked it, good for you.Suicide Squad had some redeeming quality and BvS was quite good compared to this. Most mediocre films like Kong Skull Island etc etc do. This film? there's barely any redeeming quality about it.Final Rating: 4.4",Venom
675,janjeltes,Media wide manipulation. Why?,7,6 October 2018,"Reality check. We know most viewers are loving venom. Hardy does an excellent job, the story is good enough (it's a comic book adaptation!).So why the industry wide hate from the media outlets? Control over what you think. All the critics (except for one who was lukewarm) are at the opposite end of the score scale, this doesn't happen by accident. The issue? The only obvious factor is a male lead.If you have the time, look at the sites who have torn it apart. Compare their reviews of Wonder Woman or Even the female ghostbusters.The most worrying aspect isn't the extreme prejudice, it's the number of media outlets in lockstep with each other.This film is definitely worth the watch.

But given the interesting subject matter and very capable actors this film is certainly not a failure. Tom Hardy was great, the CGI was passable, and the back and forth between symbiote and host was genuinely engaging. The climax left me pretty underwhelmed, I honestly didn't think the movie was even close to over when it was going on which tells you how thrilling the ending was. The writing was probably the biggest weakness, I don't know if an 'R' rating would've done that much but I would've liked to see how that turned out. Venom certainly has potential, and if given the opportunity to exist along side a certain friendly neighborhood superhero, the contrast between the two would make for a truly captivating viewing",Venom

So I was really curious about watching Venom. Honestly, I am happy to say the movie didn't disappoint AT ALL! The fact that Sony is trying to start a new universe distant from MCU is probably the only thing that makes me think about the future of this and maybe the critics were in disbelief even though that's not an excuse about the low score they gave on this one. It was at least an OK movie and in my opinion more than ok. I would really love to see a Tom Hardy Venom/Tom Holland Spiderman crossover but I know it's not gonna happen. So that leaves us where? Will at some point Venom meet Spiderman? And if yes who is gonna play Spiderman?

683,SeakDub,Venom=Spider-Man,4,13 October 2018,"Sony is turning Venom into another Spider-Man trilogy. Story - Boring and average. Certain parts of the movie were entertaining of the least. But most of the time you get emotionless dialogues that kill the vibe. Then on top of that the action scenes that if you blink you miss it parts. Way too much jumping around during the fighting. Looked like a bad CGI blur. Characters - Everyone in this movie was eh. Tom Hardy seemed to do the best job where everyone else was just an emotionless person with a Kristen Stewart face. Its like the movie cancels the good and bad out. Some moments it was cool and made you laugh. Then other parts were boring and wanting it to hurry up and move along. Besides Tom Hardy's character, everyone else you don't remember. And in my opinion, didn't like anyone.Venom - I did not know Venom's backstory much besides that I thought he was a villain and caused havoc. In this movie he was an anti-hero where you feel sorry for and wanted him to win. I was hoping after feeling sorry for the character Eddie Brock that he would turn into a killing machine and just destroy everyone. But no, he still has a heart that only kills the very bad, and that is a maybe. He was a villain in my mind but for all I know he could join the Avengers. I don't care that he is changing into an anti-hero but I was expecting to watch a man become a villain. Not the same ole stuff. Average - This movie is just average. I feel like I liked parts and other parts I didn't. At this point with all these superhero movies I was hoping for a different turn with a villain movie. But it ended up being just another superhero movie. You seen it once you seen them all. This movie deserves to be rated a 5 or 6 just for how plain it is. I decided to be nice and give it a 6. Judge for yourself but lot of people talking about how awesome this movie is. It is not. A slow build up backstory that has its moments but nowhere as good.All in all the movie could be a skip and you could wait for it to rent. I wouldn't rush this movie and just wait to rent it when you can. I just wished Venom was more villainous. It was suppose to be a different form of superhero movie and what we got was the same thing in a world of superhero movies. Skip theaters and rent it is my call.",Venom

686,FilmLiquet,Film Liquet on Venom,4,7 November 2018,"Venom is set to be the first movie in the Sony's Universe of Marvel Characters and a first standalone Spider-Man villain movie. The story of the film is based on the Venom: Lethal Protector(1993) comic book, but many things from it was cut out to make a much more realistic story introducing the character. Journalist Eddie Brock is trying to take down Carlton Drake, the notorious and brilliant founder of the Life Foundation, who won't stop at anything to achieve his goal, even if it means to sacrifice people. While investigating one of Drake's experiments, Eddie's body merges with the alien symbiote Venom - leaving him with superhuman strength and power.Even though the film has a PG-13 rating, watching it makes you wonder whether the adult rating was intended in the first place, because some scenes draw a really thin line between the two ratings. Comic book lovers won't be disappointed with the look of symbiotes and some action scenes are impressive and interesting to follow. Also, the dark humor and Eddies interaction with Venom must be pointed out. Venom is not just a black costume with powers, it's a different personality living in the head and taking care of the host. What makes it special is that Tom Hardy made the voice of Venom and their conversation feels real due to pre-recorded voice over which was used on set.Unfortunately, nothing much can be added to the advantages of the film above. The film has many problems starting with a poor script and ending with a temp of storytelling. Characters are written to be plain, without any depth and development. Even understanding the writers idea to prepare the viewer for symbiote appear, first act of the film some may find boring and excessive.",Venom

I'd have to say my favorite parts of the film are when Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, and Reid Scott are together on screen they all three have great chemistry, and lead to some laughs.My biggest concern is now leading up to Venom Let There Be Carnage is the PG-13 rating, as well as the runtime. This films run time was 1hr and 52mins but still felt short.

But at the end Mr. Avarad and Sony had the final saying, so off course they had to turn it in to a trainwreck.Almost every scene is crammed up with forced ""whacky Humor"" and the narrative is as coherent as the one in ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"". Also felt the pacing of this movie like it whas made in the early 90ies. One does have to watch Eddie Brock stumbling around between a boring relationship and genericaly investigative journalism... for at least 40 minutes at the ""Beginning"" of the movie. After that, one is shortly rewarded with a couple of great scenes of interaction between Eddie and Venom... then you have to sit through the rest of the movie.But at least the movie is PG13,... So a lot of people will see this and that is all what counts in this business today. Congrats Sony!",Venom
698,thomasgrindol,A pretty good movie with lots of forgettable characters,8,6 October 2018,"With the reviews this film had I expected a garbage fire. I got a pretty good movie instead. Tom Hardy is the highlight as well as Eddie's dynamic with Venom. The action scenes are really good except for the last one with the rocket, where the film pretty much just loses all its energy and becomes really boring. The rest of the characters are just kind of there, they aren't terrible and I remember their names, but I have no real interest to see more of them. Carlton Drake is a truly uninteresting villain and Riot is Worse. I don't like possession characters because I either have to care about the person being possessed or the person has to be intimidating. When you have your main villain be a limping medic, an old lady, and a little girl before finally going into Riz Ahmed don't be surprised if people don't like the character. Ultimately, Venom is a enjoyable film that falls hard in the final fight.",Venom
699,ashishtom-57605,Venom..venom,8,15 December 2018,"Awesome Anti hero Flick, i never expected that sony will go for a complete venom movie. Thank God,they lost their spiderman rights, atleast now they should be busy in developing Antihero world. Movie is great. CGI is ok. More important thing is the perfection of Tom Hardy. ""We are...Venom""Only thing i feel bad is about the villian symbiote,Riot. Actually Riot have less screen presence,but his intro was giving more expectations. We all can guess that the venom will win the climax fight anyway. Even though They made Riot so weak. That's a flaw.The film more deals with the relationship of Eddie and Venom.So it's completely an origin movie.And there is a post credit scene regarding Carnage, the best villian in the symbiote universe.",Venom
700,pachomar84,Much better than the critics said,9,7 December 2018,"Honestly, this movie was entertaining and had good action scenes and acting (the interaction between Brock/Venom is quite fun).

702,MekkaMax,Stupid But Fun,6,6 October 2018,"I was actually looking forward to this movie because of the cast and the director. After seeing some reviews online, I went in expecting to be disappointed. However, this movie was a fun time. It's not a good movie, but there are funny moments and moments where the 7 year old inside of you just wants to smile as you see a good portrayal of venom on screen wrecking people. The dynamic between Eddie Brock and Venom is phenomenal. Their banter was so fun to watch. Besides Tom Hardy, the rest of the cast felt bland compared to what they usually give for other movies. I didn't care about any of them. The plot was also not the greatest. You have seen this movie multiple times before but Tom Hardy definitely tries to save it. The action scenes are once again really fun to watch. Overall, this movie has a good amount of problems, but it was a better time than I would have imagined.",Venom

704,revelinchaos,"Weak, Uninspired",6,9 November 2018,"I generally love Marvel's productions for both the big and small screen, so I was looking forward to this, but in my opinion they wasted a good chance to do something original and captivating with the antihero angle, like they did with Deadpool.It felt like nothing really meaningful, eventful or interesting was happening most of the time and the different parts of the story seemed quite weak, disconnected and inconsequential, thing which made it very hard to really care about any of the characters, including the titular Brock/Venom.I guess acting was OK, especially from Hardy, but still, it felt kind of muted and deadpan, probably also because of the uninspired script and overall story. Definitely not a very good genesis story to kick off the franchise...And nice CGI, yes, but par for the course and definitely not able to carry the movie by itself...5.5/10",Venom
705,Moonstrike9,It's a very flawed movie,9,6 October 2018,"But damn, even though it's so transparent, I just really enjoyed the action, gore, and implausible plot line. I'd watch it again, unapologetically.",Venom
706,Watcher42,Missed opportunity,4,25 November 2018,"What an incredibly average film.It takes no risks. It's watered down. It's generic. It's trying to give the impression it's following Deadpool down the R-Rated super hero route, but it didn't have the guts to go the whole way, or even take a step really.Tom Hardy is an OK Eddie Brock, but I still find him a bit hit and miss as an actor, and that comes through even from scene to scene here. Sometimes he just mumbles his way through with no effort and I genuinely wondered if he was channeling Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, while other times he actually seemed to be trying, especially with the physical aspects. There's no connection or chemistry between Tom and Michelle Williams. I guess she was just hoping for some Marvel money and didn't realise this was a Sony picture. And the rest of the cast are incredibly average and forgettable. Especially Jenny Slate, who will always be stuck as Mona-Lisa from Parks & Rec.There's years of comic book lore and stories to draw on for Venom, but they ignore much of it... For example, why does Venom look like Spider-man? We know why from the comics, but in the movie it makes no mention of this, so we're left with questions and a very one dimensional character as a result.Of all the stories that could have been told about a symbiotic alien, and all the interesting directions they could have taken the story, they decide to go with what boils down to a boring buddy movie.",Venom

709,dannyloeper,Venom - A fast paced anti-hero film,7,8 January 2020,"Very late to the party with this review, but I'm going through as many movies as I can! Venom is a character I always enjoyed as the overall personality is very interesting and unique. I like the idea that venom needs a host to survive, and the way it interacts with Brock is pretty fun!! I think the pacing of this film is a bit fast and stuff is just kindof thrown at you. My overall favorite parts of the movie is the interactions between venom and Brock, seeing how he slowly starts to trust him more and more.This movie loses some points for me, and much of it has to do with character development. Like I stated before, new characters felt so rushed when they were introduced and then before we knew it they were dead or just never shown again. The action sequences very done quite well and I was totally in it, but the dialogue and character interactions felt so forced and awkward. When Brock shows up to his ex's house to find her with this new doctor boyfriend, it just felt like a very forced scene, and was quite diluted.Overall, this movie does a good job of showing how venom functions inside of Brock and how there direct relationship evolves.",Venom
710,garyphillimore,Awful,3,16 June 2019,"Can't believe I wasted nearly 2 hours of my life watching this, I can't believe Tom Hardy would lower him self to star in this waste of time. Only watch if you've got nothing else to do and you are at your wits end or else don't bother",Venom
711,lmhale35601,Good intro for Venom,7,13 February 2019,"I'm a big Tom Hardy fan and was so pumped to see the movie, but right from the start, the lack of chemistry between Tom and Michelle Williams just nearly ruined the whole thing for me. Tom is such a good actor with lots of confidence and character, then you have Michelle with this dull, drab personality, she just doesn't fit into this movie. If you just put her aside and focus on everything else, it's a good movie and I definitely look forward to more Venom, just please find another actress for Michelle Williams part.",Venom
712,nickijjohnson,Why Tom Hardy? Why Riz Ahmed?,5,13 October 2018,"The ultimate problem with this movie for me was the casting. I haven't watched very many Tom Hardy films and I don't know if he just sucks at playing an American but his acting here was terrible. Half the movie he walked, talked and acted like a five year old. It was awkward at times to watch. This Riz kid (emphasis on kid) acted well but how formidable can you really be when you look like a teeny bop? That also needed a switch. An actor too old cast as the hero and an actor too young cast as the villain. I can think of Jake Gylennhal being better for Venom and it's odd he hasn't done a Marvel movie yet. If we had to have Tom Hardy he needed to drop about ten pounds or so (sorry this is just business not ""fat shaming""-eye roll-obviously he's not fat but a more athletic build would tighten up those fight scenes). Moving on, story wise his girl was made out to be pretty unlikable pretty quickly. She was gonna marry this man and six months later she's got another dude? Her and doc should've just been friends. Venom too quickly decides he likes earth telling Eddie he convinced him. When? How? Did we miss a scene? I think so. The end fight was a bit too rushed and predictable. I give this film props because it was entertaining, Venom had some funny one liners (the ones you could understand with that voice) and he was a likable antihero.",Venom
713,sendtoshailesh,new character is born and must watch,9,27 January 2019,"Venom - The new character is born and i categories it in must watch if you like fictional characters like in series of avenger.
It was very well articulated and picturised. Theme of movie stand up to ensure it does off the track. VFX at it best and all character were able to do justice with story running behind introducing this character.
If get thrilled watching fictional characters then this must watch and I feel it's beginning of Venor movie series which will eventually show competency with other fictional characters in Hollywood movies.",Venom

716,lukabogdanhodgson,Good story and funny in parts,9,3 September 2020,I found this film witty and kinda scary at the same time. It's not a horror obviously but Venom is quite creepy with his voice and look. I think the story line is very interesting as I love it when people suddenly get super powers and take revenge. The restaurant scene was super funny when he gets in the fish tank. I love when people make a massive scene. I didn't really like the girlfriend/wife she was slightly anoyying,Venom

never picked up a ComicBook ever, the same ones who go online & goggle some quick general knowledge of some story arcs instead of reading the source material, they just don't know how to judge comic films..theirs PROS & CONS with this film like any other film, but all in all it was VERY, VERY entertaining for me, my fam, and friends, and the audience..went 2x, both times packed house, both times ppl having fun...How Sony managed to pull off a VENOM film without mentioning Spidey once is beyond me..but guess what they ACTUALLY did it...I was going into he film mad with my doubts & issues being a heavy Spiderman Universe fan...and was surprised & pleased that Tom Hardy Delivered...not surprised much bout that...but what I am surprised is the voicing of Venom & Eddie which he did, Eddie & Venom's demeanor, It was a blast and hilarious to see...it was a take on Venom I did not expect and an actually loving the more I see the film...if you ask me which Venom was better tween S.Man 3 & this portrayal...lmaooooooo too easy...two words TOM HARDY...watch it for yourself first then judge..",Venom
719,wyplmaa,"I haven't seen it yet, however",6,5 October 2018,"I would say though I haven't seen the movie, since it was just released locally, that the movie will be worth seeing. However, the trailer shows me that the average young person, sorry to say , isn't very intelligent. So Venom would ""crush everyone else""? Really? The most powerful super hero in the MCU is Hulk, Thanos is not a super hero, he's a super villain. I'm pretty sure Thanos would slam Venom like a rag doll, as would hulk. What is with the young generation and ""dark heroes""? You know, those ""anti-hero"" types who represent amorality? Like ""the Dark Knight"", why is that character so popular with young audiences? Because the younger generation do not understand that there IS good and evil. If they had lived during the WWII era, they MIGHT think differently, or possibly WWII would have ended in a victory for evil since I doubt today's generation has the courage or sand to fight for what is right. Just my opinion, but while the WWII generation is the greatest generation, I'd say today's youth represents the nothing generation. Truth hurts.",Venom

721,lawrencestevens-58369,Not terrible like some say it is.,6,3 October 2018,"This film certainly has its flaws and can be really cliche, predictable, not funny when trying to be and the script in places is just dreadful. Tom Hardy'a acting isn't as good as we've seen but is still good. The highlight of this film is the back and fourth banter and dark humour between Eddie and the symbiote. The venom action was cool and the cgi wasn't too bad like cough cough justice league. The music was hit and miss, with some themes being fitting and badass but some awful music in odd places. The cinematography is alright but nothing noteworthy. The villain is very cliche and generic, also I didn't really care for any character besides Eddie. Also the end credit scene is kinda cool and I want to see what they do next if a sequel is coming. Overall I recommend this movie if you're a fan of the character, Tom Hardy, marvel or just superhero stuff in general. It's not nearly as bad as some make it out to be",Venom
722,davidepsteiniphone,Worth the wait,10,12 October 2018,I first found out about the movie earlier in year and remember being disappointed I had to wait so long to see it. It was worth every day waiting. The movie was awesome. The acting was great. The plot was simple and entertaining. I really liked the psychological application I had in my thoughts during the movie and how the capability to try to survive in a free habitat was prioritized from scene comparisons.,Venom
723,connorwburnett,"Unnecessary and bland, just as I expected",4,9 October 2018,"Venom tries it's hardest to entertain an audience so used to the constant waves of superhero flicks and instead forgets to be at all captivating. Extremely predictable throughout, I was not impressed by this mess of a film.Personally I find Tom Hardy to be quite a decent actor with my favourite portrayal of him being his performance in 2015's Mad Max Fury Road. In Venom he plays our main character Eddie Brock, quite an amiable everyday man, who works as a news presenter in his own personal feature. I believe his version of the beloved comic book character was relatively well-done compared to other depictions of recent years (Spider Man 3 as an example). However he could only carry this character so far because of the abhorrent script which in my opinion was the clear-cut worst part of this film. After the rise of the Marvel Universe movies every superhero film has felt the need to adopt their constant quippy humour, which can be used quite effectively when it's fits the correct tone, but this was executed very poorly in Venom's case. You'll have a seemingly serious scene setting a darker tone and then instantly switch back to Tom Hardy popping off one-liners completely destroying the aura the film hoped to create.I found our villain of Venom to be quite weak because of the little development he got throughout the picture and as many have already mentioned I believe that most of the films problems could be solved with a slightly longer runtime, more fleshed out script and stronger villain. I'm hoping to write another review of this film when I get to see it again but for now these are my initial impressions.",Venom
724,The_Coffee_Frog,"Formulaic, Boring and Werid.",5,11 November 2018,"This is coming from someone who was very optimistic about ""Venom"" when more or less everyone wasn't but when I went to see the film I was very underwhelmed, but it was not all bad I will start with the good and move into tremendously large bad section.The Good:
Tom Hardy acts well considering the crappy script he was given, the visual effects were good and Venom looks like he is susposed to (apart form the white spider symbol).The Bad:
The script is trash, even when you put aside the fact that they ignore all pervious incarnations of the character its just plain and simply horrifically written. As I mentioned in my headline it is extremely formulaic and it doesn't try to be anything more than ""Popcorn Flick"". I won't go into to much detail but several scenes that take place in the movie actually don't make any sense stuff happens that either has no relevance to the plot or Is not explained ala ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"", there is also a scene in which they try to convae serious emotion and it falls flat on it's face.Conclusion:
The worst part is I thought in line with ""Sony's"" pervious escapades it would be box office genocide, but in fact it has sorred especially in China, I just hope that the inevitable ""Venom 2"" is better
5/10",Venom
725,euandaley,A Perfect Match,7,8 October 2018,"Just like the premise of the symbiote, in that it needs a perfect host, this movie needs to be watched by its niche audience, those who loved Venom from the comics and have been begging for an honest true to the character betrayal since the spider-man 3 days and before, will adore this film as they understand what this character is all about, for some the comedy may seem out of place in what from the trailers looks like a brooding dark gory horror. True fans of the comics will recognise this as being one of Venoms trademark traits, twisted somewhat offensive and dark humour, and for the most part it lands. This film plays more like a character study or more accurately a study of Eddie brocks relationship with Venom, these parts of the movie (I say parts not moments as they take up the majority of the film) are fantastic, Tom Hardys performance is yet again phenomenal his love for the character shines through. The supporting characters are a little flat and 1 diemensional and they're main purpose is aiding Eddie through the story. The Action scenes are well made for the most part the first action scene is incredible! And the last fight scene is pretty decent they're are a few low points throughout the film, but these are only seconds due to the films incredibly fast pacing that oddly suits the tone of Venoms character always demanding for things to happen immediately, impatient if you will. Some will find it hard to keep track of the discrepancies of the story due to this, as the high octane movie fails to make room for breathing. All in all a restricted yet still very enjoyable movie that will please fans and newcomers alike inviting them into Sonys new darker vision for its universe of all things marvel are too terrified to attempt... 8/10",Venom

727,zhdcndmr,I do get the bad reviews but they are still wrong.,8,26 December 2018,"As many fans of this movies knows, it got not so good reviews from critics all over. I couldnt make sense of it until I watched it. It is a good movie but its not Avengers big or Justice League big. Even Spiderman is, by its nature more anticipated then the side character like Venom and there Lies the problem, I just think people were expecting another Billion dollar project like Avengers and all the DC movies.And its not even the the budget, even Justice League, who was not received good (rightly so) was still way more anticipated just because of all the characters. In Venom, there is basically one character, Venom and the bad guy (no spoilers).So keeping all of this in mind, Venom is a Good movie. It is not a masterwork but with what it has, its good. Its witty, fun and serious at times. You get to start to care about the bond between Venom and Brock and it lays out a good foundation for future movies.The critics are just reading into it, dont care about them.",Venom
728,jonathancolley-885-704860,Don't believe the critics.,7,13 October 2018,"So, as the title says, don't believe the critics because Venom, is actually pretty good. Now while it's not anywhere close to being a classic, it has that same sort of subversive feel that you get when you watch Daredevil on Netflix for the first time. It's a bit rough, but worth the effort.One thing I have to admit is that the first half is a little on the slow side, but the second half just disappears. Seriously, one minute I'm thinking I'd made a mistake and should have waited for the bluray and then then I'm left wanting more. Brock and Venom make a great double act, it's like if the Hulk had Cujo as a pet. All Venom really wants is to eat things, everything looks delicious, and Brock is reeling him in all the time while apologising.This movie will not win awards, the industry simply will not allow it, that much is obvious, but... it will win fans, hopefully enough to gain a sequel :)",Venom

The only thing I regret is that I wish there was more Venom and Tom Hardy screen time! Even more Michelle Williams Venom would have been nice. Hopefully in a future installment! They should have cut Jenny Slate's side story and made more room for Venom and Tom Hardy's back story! And if they mentioned global warming one more time I was going to lose my mind.

It's just not the Venom

But the huge plot holes and inconsistency of the rules set by the movie were too maddening to look past.There isn't an ounce of creativity in the film, in fact I suspect the entire dialogue is comprised of lines contained in other sci-fi movies.You'd have to be brain dead to enjoy this film, if even then the visual effects are substandard. I still can't wrap my head around the lack of consistency in the ""rules"". Sometimes venom can use him self a shield for bullets. Sometimes he needs to rip off a car door to use it as a shield. Sometimes it can literally be it's own transportation but sometimes not.The symbiot needs a perfect match but it's never explained why Brady is the right match, and never explained why some humans can live after being paired and some can't. And a quick preview of lady venom? WTF. Save your brain and if you want something fun but not great watch UPGRADE.Near the end Venom notes the ""leader"" has skills and out of this world weapons Brady can't even imagine! And then he proceeds to pull out some arm knives, sledgehammer and mace.

Nothing is smooth, and it has no chemistry. Within minutes you realize something is very OFF.
 What's 'off' (in my opinion) is that entertainment STYLE and sense of humor does not always translate through to people from different countries and cultures. What you have here is, a fair attempt at an 'alien on earth' drama with a great leading man, trying his very best to work with a sub standard script, which includes humor that North American audiences will NOT find funny (just horribly corny)
During the last part of the movie I just started surfing the net, because it was too predictable (and just cheap) Ultimately the villains in this film reach out and grab you JUST LIKE GODZILLA and it's enemy, (what-ever-its-name-was.) If you WANT to LIKE this movie, I suggest you have a few alcoholic beverages first. LASTLY, don't think I'm biased or anything.

A lot of the core elements remain the same, the character is still Eddie Brock, he's still a reporter like before and in a similar plotline to Spiderman 3 (2007) Eddie Brock is at the low point of his life, he loses his job as well as his girlfriend Annie. This slowly drives Eddie Brock to the point of going insane, however the movie really starts to pick up once the symbiote takes over Eddie's life in general. The symbiote combined with Eddie Brock's influence creates Venom and I must say this version of Venom looks very much like Venom from the comics. While the special effects and CGI are a bit questionable at times, it's not enough to ruin the movie.I won't spoil the rest, but I will say that as a comic book movie, Venom is ok, although I can understand some fans not liking it as this version turns Venom into more of a super hero rather than an Anti-hero and the movie is just too safe (hence the PG-13 rating). However if your one of those who just wants to see a decent comic book movie with not much substance, then Venom is good in that respect. On the other hand, if you're expecting a violent Venom with evil intentions (like Topher Grace's Venom in Spiderman 3) then this is not the movie for you. Don't forget to stay for the mid credits, it looks promising.",Venom

743,jameskidac,I expected a Hercules from Dwayne Johnson and got almost a GOTG,9,22 October 2018,"Lets be honest, I was actually going to see First Man but then I thought you know what its a day off lets see a terrible B movie where Tom Hardy was ridiculed in my local paper as a dud etc. Then when the show came on, I was like woah, this guy is actually not bad. By the end of the movie, I realised no one else could have done it better than Tom, almost like a Pick 199. The contrast in styles are so stark. I used to revere Sam Raimi, now I think its something to do with Sony that makes Spiderman trilogy and this series tick. They have a grown up approach, not some high school bickering schtick. I hope Marvel doesn't take this over, I have had it with the infantilisation of every Marvel film to make it G. Hope Sony bets big next time with a R rated film.",Venom

747,beargod-48706,"Good film, better than the critics say",8,28 October 2018,"Overall this is a good movie. You should expect a decent popcorn flick which entertains you, gives you a similar origin story to others you have seen before and a happy ending. There are no real suprises in this movie but it succeeds to be entertaining despite of that. Just to mention three things that Venom the movie lacks:
1. The character arc of the symbiot is not explained and hard to follow. You see the creatures getting to earth, vreac havoc, kill multiple times, being aggressive. From the backstory you learn, that they are a really agressive and brutal race, apex predators. And then the one that forms the symbiotic relationship with Eddie Brock, becomes suddenly ""good"". Not that good, but it realises that he doesnt want to butcher earth and is ready to kill his own kind to save humanity.... This character arc is not really drawn. Once Venom says it's just because of you Eddie, once he says it's because he is a ruler in the society of the symbiotic creatures and here he has a much better life.
2. No blood not enough violence. This has been mentioned many times before and yes: Sony castrated this film to get more revenue and avoid R rating. This could have been a real cult classic if they had managed to bring in enough blood and slaughter. That would have added to the plot.
3. The supporting cast is one dimensional. I have read some articles about the supporting cast beeing terrible with only Tom Hardy giving his best. I don't think this is the case but it's surely true that the other characters are pretty one dimensional and the actors do not give an additional layer to it.All together this is a good movie, worth to watch.",Venom
748,racheallocklear,Enjoyable and Heartwarming,10,7 October 2018,Venom is way better then its given credit for because it puts two beings together that are going through something we've all felt and that's being the outcast. It was well thought out and the acting in it was so amazing!,Venom
749,robbiehirst-95168,Brilliant film! Ignore the critics!,9,20 June 2019,"I genuinely went into this film with a negative mind due to the bad reviews and criticism that it received.
Well I can honestly say this film was an example of why you should never rely on other opinions!
It was fantastic! It was every bit of traditional Marvel that it should be!
It was fun, it was funny, it was dramatic, it was suspenseful and it was visually pleasing!
Tom Hardy is someone I barely see on tv or film because maybe he's just in things I don't generally watch but I thought his part in this film was such a refreshing change to the usual type of actor cast for them.
I thought the story was typical of the early day Marvel theme which was a complete credit to the film. The cast were brilliant in general.
Overall I genuinely believe this film deserved more than the reception it's had because it was very entertaining! Loved it!",Venom
750,bfml-03018,What's the point?,2,14 January 2019,"Venom is a movie to dark (art style) with a bad action and the last fight is a cgi mess. The movie lacks plot direction and characters changes,evolution and depth are more then scarce.

The things I didn't like about it were the fact that it didn't tie into the Spiderverse. I also didn't like the fact that it seemingly set itself up for exclusively hosting Symbiote villains in future movies. That will likely doom its sequels. I do like Kletus Casady's character, and Woody Allen is a spectacular villain in all of his movies. I enjoyed his end-of-credits scene. I just hope this blooms into something multidimensional.",Venom

Acting in general was very wrong, weird and fake. Tom Hardy kind of carried this thing, but he felt too good for this role.I blame it all on bad directing, bad script and extremely bad editing.P.S.: I never heard any ""critics"" before watching this movie and I really dont understant all those 10/10 ""ignore critics!"" reviews.

765,rob-26401,Tom Hardy is painfully awful.,1,8 April 2019,Any superhero film depends on the strength of it's main character. Venom ultimately fails because Tom Hardy is totally wrong for the part he plays. He's far too goofy and acts more like the comedy sidekick in a very bad cop flick. The story behind Venom could have worked with another leading man. Michele Williams is brilliant even though it's impossible to believe she would find anything to like in her costar.,Venom

Story-wise, there are some flaws if you really think about it, but it is dwarfed by the fun action on screen. Tom Hardy did his best, but the way the film was developed caused it to have significant tonal differences throughout the movie, the comedy in this movie is not evenly spread( the first half is completely different from the rest) Overall, if you want a movie with Venom(at least the one from Comics) this is by far the closest it'll get. (For a film bound to get a sequel, I'm surprised that symbiotes like Scream didn't make it)",Venom

With that out of the way it was a fun pop corn flick. It didn't get all SJW at all and is a decent foundation for the start of something bigger. The cgi isn't bad at all (hard to find a decnet alien symbiote actor these days anyway). The bad part is the slow start but once it starts going, it goes. Michelle Williams is fine and the evil agent does he job as nameless thug #1. Again, if you go in with limited or no expectations, you will enjoy this film.

How many is too many? When will they run out of these? Probably never.
Fat paychecks lure serious actors to attach themselves to these 2 hour Hollywood cliches.
Tom Hardy is a serious actor who can carry an entire movie ALL BY HIMSELF. See ""Locke"" a 2013 film . It's him in a car. Period. He pulls it off. Not many actors could.
So why did Mr. Hardy sell out? Because the price was right. I don't know who said it but everything is for sale. You just haven't hit the right price.As for the movie itself, it's a comic book based movie like the dozens of others.
Ongoiing testament to Hollywood's lack of creativity and the public's lack of taste and shallowness. I tried to watch it until the creature made an attempt at being funny... I then made an attempt at ending my viewing abruptly.
Only one of these attempts was successful.",Venom

It starts a bit slow but when venom is joined to Eddie it picks up. The true rating of this movie is 7.5 to 8 but I decided to give it a 9 to balance the critics who love to see everyone die in a movie or some kind of sadistic ending to give it a high rating.,Venom

(1) I don't think Tom Hardy really had chemistry with the love interest. It felt very awkward and forced (maybe excluding 1 or 2 scenes towards the end. (2) Her wig was trash the whole movie, it annoyed me so deeply...like im sure her real hair would've looked better so why. And (3) they didnt really get into venom's choice to save the planet or stay on earth. It was like a few light convos, some light exposure to love and then suddenly he's willing to go against his own race and murder hisown pple cuz he likes tom?",Venom

And I wasn't disappointed with the result. Venom has two main parts: establishing the character and an action-packed second half. A smart move since Venom will stay here for a long time in the Marvel Universe and has plenty of room for future collaboration. A funny, entertaining watch, especially the scenes where Venom is having conversations with Eddie. Tom Hardy's performance is always a joy to see, in addition to the VFX, which I found quite satisfying. A good experience, and I am eager for the next one.",Venom

782,maroinjoundi,It's gets better after the first part,6,7 October 2018,"Critics killed this movie. 30/100 on metacritic? No film should deserv this, exspecially this one. Let's talk about the beginning, it starts pretty bad. We get the landing of the symbiotes on earth and riot just starts to kill random people because yes, every 2000 movie had that scene at the beginning, but for 2018 nah, that was unnecessary. Aaand then we get Tom, yes, ma man. Cheesy dialogues, they wanted to show us the relationship with his girlfriend but that last something like 5 minutes because then we get the interview with Riz. They basically didn't introduce us that Brock wanted to frame this science guy Drake, we don't even know what drake does actually, but everything happen so fast. In 5 minutes this happen: Brock frame the guy because he randomly finds a confidential email about the dead people of the crash at the beginning on his girlfriend's laptop, he gets fired from tv because drake got the money and he doesn't want people to know his evilness, his girlfriend leave him because she got automatically fired from her job since that email should be confidential.Do i care about her leaving him? No, why? Because they didn't introduce us their relationship, years of engagement were summond in 2 minutes at the beginning.Drake starts doing his experiments with the symbiotes, he gets a guy named Isaac as a subject to bond with a simbiot. So, Drake, as every villain, he starts quoting the bible, because isaac is a biblic name. NO, why are you doing this? It's not 2003 HULK, at least you could've made Isaac interrupt him, saying that what is saying is dumb or something like that. It's 2018 guys, blockbusters cannot afford this cheesy shit. Ok, second part that's where the movie gets better, from a 5 to a 6.5/7 i guess. Still mediocre, but better. But we aren't meeting venom now. So i'm gonna sum up some ridiculous stuff.Brock is pretty bumbed out about everything and he meets this Doctor that want him to get into Drake's company and collect proves about the experiments on humans with the aliens. He does so, one of the guinea pigs is a friend of him, he tries to free her and she attacks him, actually venom attacks him and he bonds with him. He get the super man powers and he can super jump, he's strong and yatta yatta. He gets home after escaping the place and he meets venom. Drake break down the Doctor that got Brock in and she dies of course because Riz Ahmed is EVIIIIL in this movie. Drake send his men to get Brock and he crashes them because he's got the big V. He starts questioning a little bit everything, but he does seem accepting the reality of an alien inside him, pretty normal, everyday routine. Venom wants Brock to take Drake's rocket so he can go to his planet and bring other symbiotes in. They first go to Brock's former workplace and he leaves his phone with all the photos of Drake's experiments to his boss. While getting out of there a bunch of swat members is waiting for him, he kills them all, and his ex girlfriend, while searching for him, randomly gets there and she sees everything. She scream once, Brock tells her:""it's not me it's venom"" and she's like:""oh yeahh, that makes sense,let's go to the hospital and try to figure everything up, ok?"" ""Yeah, sure"".They get to the hospital and they tweek with the frequency and venom gets out of brock's body. He leaves, but Drake man get him. Venom escape and get in a dog(they introduced that dog before and now venom is in him, so funny -_-). From the god he passes to Brock ex girlfriend and she willingly takes him, no problema, routine again. They got to free Brock, venom gets in him again and he now decided that he doesn't want to bring other aliens. Drake has a simbiot of his own now, wich is Riot, the one they introduced us at the beginning and he got there with a toddler's body. Riot wants to got to space, venom stops him and Riot dies. 
Blackout.
End of the movie.",Venom
783,olkan_gndgu1996,Many Reasons Why Movie Is Bad,3,24 March 2020,"Movie is terrible. I can say many reasons. I read almost all the Symbiote comics about Carnage,Venom and other symbiote characters. And this is seriously not Venom. Venom is not jocular character. Carnage is the jocular character but mainly he doing psychopath jokes. And in this movie Venom is boring and doing too much joke.. I seriously suprised and said ''What the hell is this?'' First of all movie starts too quickly. Everything happens too quickly and skipping everything too fast. Last battle was a joke. I don't know why people like it. They was just dancing and skipping everything. There is no detail. Riot's death is the biggest joke. I don't like it. I don't care anyone say. Mostly kids like the movie. This is not Venom.",Venom

I guess it's tough to find a paying gig where being a thesaurus torturing snark is an asset.For me, Venom was fun. Other than the trailer, I had no knowledge of Venom as a character so I watched it with an open mind.It's not easy to categorize but in tone, it's closer to Deadpool than Spiderman... an entertaining mix of ultra-violence and quips.They didn't waste a lot of time on backstory and setup, which moved things along nicely.

Lots of flaws, cliches and inconsistencies, predictable as well, if it wasn't for Hardy the movie would have been bad. Some super-hero movie received way more criticism than they deserved, but this one deserves criticism. Yes, most people might find it somehow entertaining, but that's what Marvel is all about. Unfortunately for me I have seen lots of super-hero/comic-book movies and this one I wouldn't put in the good half. It's just nothing to like, except Hardy (but that's definitely not his best role, far from it) and a few jokes. It's meant for 14-16 years olds in my opinion. Sorry if I'm hard on the movie, but let's not fool ourselves, it's just an okay movie.",Venom

795,Paul-Corio,Solid and fun comic book action movie,7,19 June 2019,"Tom Hardy steals the show as Eddie Brock in a far superior version of Venom than seen previously in Spider Man 3. Once again displaying his action chops, but also encompassing a dark comic humour that works well tonally with the source material and keeps things interesting throughout. There is some really good interplay between Hardy and his dark alien alter ego once the movie hits its stride.Tonally, the mix works well and there is enough good stuff throughout to make this an entertaining and engaging movie, despite taking a little while to pick up the pace and establish itself. The plot and story are solid enough, however the remainder of the cast do get caught under Hardy's Shadow and struggle to keep up, seemingly little more than accessories at times.The action scenes are mostly gripping, if not a little over the top, even by Marvel standards. As is the use of CGI, which may have been supposed to look more than a little cartoony than vividly realistic, but can get a little hard viewing and confusing especially as many of them are set at night.There are a couple of plot holes that you will
pick up on, especially if you are a Marvel fan, however nothing that detracts to much.I would have liked to have seen the movie connected a little more to the wider MCU as I feel that Marvel movies always benefit from at least a little connection, but that might just be me.Overall, good entertaining fun with a lot of potential for the inevitable sequel, if they can make improvements.",Venom
796,LuisPunisher,Entertainment is what matters,8,29 January 2021,"And this is fun to watch. I strongly believe that this is a good movie, as i enjoyed it even more than other highly acclaimed super-hero films. Yes, anti-heroes are nothing new, but this movie represents one of Marvel most beloved anti-heroes/villains so well.In fact, i would say that the design of Venom for this movie is nothing short of amazing. It is miles away (for the better) than the dissapointing appearance of him in Spiderman-3, and is such a delight to watch. The cgi is done in such a stylish flavour that you can forgive some of the film flaws by how good Venom looks.The story is ok...perhaps a bit cliched. But the action scenes are great, and in my opinion this is the main reason to watch super hero movies.So my title for this review is intented to claim that, what matters in the end, is how much entertainment value you get from the media you consume. Be it films, music, books, videogames, anime, whatever the heck you are into. You should ask yourself: am i having fun? Rather than thinking this or that. Yes, critical thinking matters, but sometimes you just have to lay down your analylitcal thoughts and just enjoy. And i bet that if you give it the chance, this movie will be a fine time for you.",Venom
797,FLYINGGADGET2014,WE CAN DO WHAT EVER WE WANT!!!,10,9 October 2018,"I would like to start off by saying, I don't give a flying Venom what the critics say about this movie. I was impressed, this was an AWESOME Movie.
It's got Humor, Action, drama, and romance...
Don't let the critics tell you different... It's worth it. Judge for yourself.
In One story Venom gets recruited by Agents of Shield. So fingers crossed for a crossover in the MCU.",Venom
798,evan-pahl,Venom is a hit. Expect big things from Sony in the future.,7,30 October 2020,"Most professional critics didn't like this film but casual movie fans loved it. Venom as a character gets a second chance after getting entirely misrepresented in Spiderman 3 (2007) and gets it done in a way that can only be described as metal; the tone totally flipped the script and took the audience by surprise the moment Tom Hardy climbed into the lobster tank, letting you know exactly what kind of movie they were going to give you.
However, Michelle Williams' parts seemed like they were off-beat and held no weight for the plot or tone trying to conveyed. Marvel also tends to have a pattern of making the villain nothing much more than a evil, bigger mirror version of the hero; Sony fell for that same trap with this film, but only to showcase that power of the symbiotes as characters withing the universe, as Sony is seemingly trying to cash in on their own Spider-Villian-verse; understanding that much helps the viewer sit back and enjoy the CGI spectical of the film, which is pretty great considering it is a lot of very well done CGI. Overall this was a funny action movie for a popular Spiderman villian/antihero film that already has a sequel in the works. Expect big things from Sony after this film.",Venom
799,bob_james9397,Recycled Story Line But Very Entertaining and Hilarious!,6,1 April 2019,"ZZZZe loser WHITE GUY tries to slip past his foreign born ""LANDLORD"" without paying hizzzz rent??? This movie should be in the comedy genre. Even if you're not a Marvel fan you'll like the catchy wit and comedic value. As far as the story? It's been done at least 15 times in the last 15 years. But definitely worth your time.",Venom
800,philpriestley,Very poor,4,31 August 2019,"This is well beneath the talent of Tom Hardy, but he must have been well paid to do it.The script is terrible, the story is clunky and nonsensical, it lurches from here to there and offers little or no development along the way.Venom as a character begins as a threatening coercive parasite - but ends up as a comedy live in character, the change happens like the throw of a light switch somewhere in the middle.Female lead is as forgettable as her two dimensional character.The villain is just short of rubbing his hands together and laughing sadistically.The whole thing hangs together like it was written by a ten year old before a Hollywood committee worked it over.Very poor.",Venom
801,mwinkler-06904,Forget the critics. Go see it.,10,5 October 2018,"Ignore the critics, naysayers, & snobs. I've been a venom fan since I was a little kid (35 now) and have waited patiently for him to finally get his due diligence on screen. I was not disappointed and was thoroughly entertained. So spidey wasn't in it... so what? That story has been done and us true fans know how that played out anyway. However one story we are pumped for is the Venom vs Carnage showdown. So get yourselves to the theatre and support Tom's performance of our favorite antihero. (Now if only i could get a decent Silver Surfer film my life would be complete)",Venom
802,The_Man_XX7,Not a turd in the wind,6,10 October 2018,"I liked Venom it was a fun, exciting time and if anyone hasn't seen it they should go and watch it for themselves and come up with their own opinion of the movie.Now what I liked MOST about Venom was not the action, nor the CGI or the Venom character itself but the way how the movie sets up the Eddie Brock character in the beginning of the movie and the world around him before the Venom craziness happens, now it's nothing Oscar worthy like that but it was really well done and I always appreciate when Superhero movies builds up the character development of the main protagonist and this is the movie's strength as it makes you sympathize and understand Eddie Brock's character before the comic book stuff happens and y'all already know Tom Hardy brings his all to the role.The supporting cast was also fine it was a small cast and it worked for the movie especially Michelle Williams who played Eddie's girlfriend how was fine in the role and thankfully she wasn't some damsel in distress and was significant to the story. The humour was also well done in the movie as the movie does a better job of handling humour better than most Marvel Studio movies as in no way did I feel that the humour was out of place at all and with the funniest character being Tom hardy as Eddie Brock's encounters with the Venom symbiote at the beginning would make some funny interactions with other characters. The action was very fun especially with chase scene that would make the Mission impossible movies proud.For the Venom character before I say anything else yes Tom hardy's portrayal of Venom was better than Topher Grace's performance in Spider-Man 3. Venom was awesome he looked great, the voice was also great, most of the action scenes involving Venom were exciting, brutal and fun and funny...yes funny. Also, the way how they explained the Symbiotes was fine with the movie explaining its origins, weaknesses and characteristics. Another very important this was that not once did I wish for Spider-Man to be in the movie (would have been awesome if he was in tin though) as the movie does a believable job of telling Venom's story without Spider-Man and the movie was fine without the R-rating nuff said.What I did like about the movie or the ""bad thing"" about Venom was mostly the third half I don't know what happened but the last 40 minutes the movie was rushed had clunky action scenes and let me not get into the final battle or sequence of the movie cause it was just a big CGI mess with Venom vs Riot which was very hard to focus on especially with the movie being 3D,also some big plot holes involving characters happen and the villain...oh boy the villain, now Riz Ahmed who was the villain wasn't the problem the movie was, Riz character Drake had an okay reason for being a villain but it was never expanded on and ended up being a generic villain and another forgettable Superhero movie villain and when he became Riot the other symbiote character(Venom's enemy) it didn't help as his interactions with Venom were cheesy as hell and again the action scenes were clunky and messy.The second half wasn't as nearly as good as the first half of the movie with very little down time as you are being thrust into action scene after action like a Michael Bay Transformers movie. The time management in the second half was messy and rushed to say the least. There was a very weird scene between Venom and Eddie that happened (you'll know when you see it) and the story just wraps up outta nowhere as well.So, to conclude Venom is a fun movie with fun action scenes, good humour, a well-done performance by Tom Hardy, and cool end credit scene however the last third of the movie was rushed and clunky. As I said if you haven't seen it yet go see it and come up with your own opinion.",Venom

804,shotgun-69216,Not the Movie for Critics,7,12 October 2018,"This was not spectacular. It wasn't some new brilliant film or an Oscar nominee. This wasn't the amazing Venom film that it could've been.That being said, it was still a pretty fun movie. It may not have had the best script, but it was still done fairly well. It would've been better if the studio had gone all-in on Venom with an R-rating, but it was surprisingly well done for PG-13 Venom. A lot of the comedy landed, even when it was unintentional, and led to a very enjoyable film. This movie may not have been what so many fans wanted, but it was a good step towards it. I hope for a sequel to build on it (and maybe an R-rating) and look forward to seeing where this goes.",Venom
805,adriano-40012,A movie I always wanted since Spider-Man 3.,10,5 October 2018,"The thing is I used to love and grow up with Spider-Man comics and Eddie Brock was one of my favorite characters, but when I heard my favorite actor Tom Hardy plays him. I was so hyped for this movie. It's almost guaranteed it will be a great blockbuster movie.The movie contains great acting skills by Hardy and he really suits well as Venom. The movie delivers amazing action combined with a believable plot and humor. It reflects and shows the person Eddie who lost everything just like in the comics. The point in his life where he becomes a loser. I also can give credits to the animations. They teased us in a very smart way with the first trailer where you don't see Venom at all. So the hype was real tho. I can really advise everyone who ever loved Venom and grew up with cartoons and comics of Spider-Man to watch the movie. It's worth it.The only two minus points I have to admit is it seems like the movie is a bit too short. And my friend told me today the director just cut out scene material around 40 minutes which was told by Hardy himself. I just don't get it. Is it maybe because of the fact the movie might be too brutal and get a FSK 18 Patch ?!?! So I hope they deliver those erased scenes in a directors cut edition. The other negative point is that it was in 3D. I'm not a fan of 3D, but to be honest it wasn't that annoying. They force you in cinemas to watch it in 3D. I prefer 2D !All in all I give it 10/10 I laughed many times, had fun to watch the movie. Not even a second you could say wow it's boring. WATCH THE CREDITS YOU'LL SEE AN AMAZING EXTRA SCENE :)",Venom
806,DarioTheSweeper,The good host.,10,7 October 2021,"I was eagerly awaiting this movie to go to the cinema. It was a great experience. It's great that a movie was made about a villain from his perspective.I liked the plot and the actors for their roles were well chosen. Tom Hardy was probably the absolute star. I would also like to mention Michelle Williams who played his great love. The movie is about a person who connects with a symbiote named Venom. Action-packed scenes entertain you at the highest level and the CGI is breathtakingly well done. The main role has a kind of schizophrenic bond with the symbiote, I can reveal. I have to say this is a serious issue.I can only recommend this movie and encourage you to take on this experience. You won't regret it if you like superhero movies.",Venom

That's nothing more than the studio needing to push th ratings to recoup more money from consumers.Venom is a popular comic book hero because of his storyline. Leave it to Hollywood to screw up an awesome character. They always have to use the same vomited formula. Do they realize there doesn't always have to be a ""Good Guy"" that does the right thing? Venom is written as a bad guy in the comic books yet the movie decides to make him into this good guy-esque figure.The comic book story was a winner. Once again Hollywood creates a loser. It's getting to the point that anything Hollywood touches turns to shhhhh. Not sure what happened to the writers of generations past, but the writers of the current generation in Hollywood need to go ahead and pass the torch because the last 10+ years have been terrible.",Venom

It was like watching the Evil Dead again for the first time, in that i truly enjoyed it in a dumb way. Quite surprised that Tom Hardy is so good at physical comedy, the smashing plates over the head routine would have fit right in. CGI was pretty run of the mill, couldn't tell who was who in the final battles, too many particle effects. Think it could have been even funnier it there was was an 18 or R rated cut.",Venom

819,moviegossip-63936,Awesome,8,19 October 2021,Tom's hardy and the woody combination are mind-blowing. When I saw true detective I am impressed with woody. As a villain he is great. When we talk about tom hardy it's hard to describe his acting level. Just I tell him that I don't know how can he do this. So natural and an innocent face always keep him better than another actor. If we talk about this movie it's great and amazing. The plot and story are so good.,Venom

821,schrilax,Some slow parts but loved it,8,17 March 2021,"This movie was not perfect by any stretch but I just loved the theatre of it all. The entrance set up the storyline. I thought the story, direction and screenplay was very good. Some movies just seem to have the superstar or star cast or even the super villain or hero and no story. This was not in the same category thankfully. I wanted venom to have more character/persona and mannerisms. More unruliness and unpredictability or pure rage is what would done so. Some parts were a little slow. The girl friend and her boyfriend parts were a bit of a distraction and maybe not so necessary but it was ""okay"" I guess. Better fight sequences with Venom/Riot in them would have been very much appreciated. Tom Hardy was good but Riz Ahmed was spectacular. After Nightcrawler this was another great performance. Wish there was more of Cletus Kasady. Cannot wait for the sequel.",Venom

The movie isn't terrible, but Eddie Brock is a dweeb and Venom/the symbiote is definitely the much funnier and better character. It was pretty predictable with a by the numbers plot. The movie picks up once Eddie and Venom meet with the symbiote having quite a few hilarious lines.
It's not a masterpiece, but it's a decent way to spend an evening.",Venom

824,dante440,venomously funny :D,10,5 January 2019,"To start off, I think the casting crew did a pretty good job on hiring these bunch of people to play their respective roles.I love how the movie moved forward as a comedy flick rather a seriously looking venom thing. Didn't know Venom was an anti hero. Always thought hes like spiderman's evil enemy. It would be great to see those two in a flick in near future. This movie was very well written and acted, don't be fooled with the fans rating on IMDB, I think the younger generation are tasteless who would rate something like wonder woman higher than this, or perhaps that lame chris hemsworth wannabe aquaman.I love the fact that these superhero flicks moving towards being funny and fun to watch. Venom character/voice over was wonderful seriously. laughed the whole way while watching this. :D . Thor Ragnarok, The Predator (2018), and now this. They were all funny. I'm starting to enjoy movies again. Its been a while. I think even Jurassic World part 2 did well too after they blundered the first one.No more of ben afflecks batman or ben affleck himself, no more henry cavill alien man of steel nonsense please. They belong in the trash and not worth in any collection. I would forgive wonder woman if she was not in fast & furious. Should have given the character to someone as prominent as emily blunt.Anyway this is an easy 8.5 people and that is watchable over & over again.",Venom

It's been a long time that while I watch a movie I do not advance scenes.
Bad picture. Written by people who can not write. Terribly directed.
Reading the revies in general I realize how many false accounts there are behind IMDB supporting and doing politics of indefensible things.
I regret having tried to see this crap.
From now on I'm going to pay attention to my instincts.
The trailer already told me that this was going to be bad.
I was surprised by what overestimates this cinematographic garbage.",Venom
826,HeirOfDorne,The Way I Wish Marvel Was,6,6 October 2018,"To start things off, I'll say that I am not by any means a huge Marvel fan. I dislike the save the world, bunnies and rainbows feel everything from Antman to Avengers has. With Sony doing something a little darker I was all in! We've seen other successes in non-Disney productions of Marvel characters like Logan, and Deadpool.  The only real complaint I have with the film are the special effects. Non essential special effects seem cheap, one such case deals with a rocket during the opening scene. However, when the special effects come to the main character, Venom, they are done perfectly well. Although it wouldn't change my overall grade more consistency in the special effects department could have increased the films overall feel. Where this film really strives is with the proformance provided by star Tom Hardy. For most of the film we see the struggle to stay human. That sadness that endures, and the hatred of Venom. The struggle between light and dark is exemplified through Tom/Venom, with a delightful conclusion. In other superhero films the hero usually doesn't go through such a drastic shift, and so the role doesn't require that extra effort in acting. The film is also getting a lot of flack for being a movie that belongs ""in the early 2000s"". While this point can be argued it is nice to get away from the cookie cutter format Disney repeatedly puts out. This story does not follow a group of unlikely heros banded together to save the world from an evil with a successful outcome just in the nick of time. This story focuses on 1 man and the pain he endures and overcomes. Venom is a nice change of pace and is just what comic fans need.",Venom

The best bit about the film was the acting of Tom Hardy and his dialogue with venom. The storyline was okay, quite predictable, but exciting none the less. Venoms CGI was okay it was good in parts and then very noticeable with others. The villain was a lot more powerful than venom and the ending should have had a bit more content. Again, Tom Hardy was the standout, little comment about the daily bugle and overall wasn't bad I enjoyed it and would watch it again.

837,michielodb,Better than I expected,7,11 December 2018,"I was actually kind of excited to see this movie. I love Tom Hardy, although I have no connection with the character of Venom I do find him very cool (yes I am not an expert), and it was going to be about an anti-villain, so what could go wrong? I remember when this movie just came out, there was such a large gap between audiences who loved it and audiences who were just bashing it out of hatred. I myself did not see this in a theater so I waited untill I could watch it at home. I went into this movie with very low expectations because it just got so much hate. Now I have seen the movie...and I kind of have to disagree with the haters on this one.I found this to be a very fun, entertaining sci-fi action movie. Okay positives first. The thing I liked the most without a doubt is the interaction between Tom Hardy and Venom, this was really fun and entertaining to watch. The jokes were all mostly good and I found myself quite invested in their relationship. This also brings me to my next positive that I honestly never saw coming: they spend a lot of time on the characterization of Tom Hardy, and it felt great. This isn't a movie where everything has to happen so fast that we don't care about our characters, no they really give him a lot of time before all of the stuff goes down and I really like that. The action is okay, it's not special, it's just good. The special effects are well done, although sometimes very cartoonish but I kind of expected that.Now the negatives. This isn't a perfect movie by far. My first complaint is pretty much the opening scene and the final scene. They are really rushed and especially the opening is not that inviting. The pacing luckily does improve fast and stays good for the large majority of the movie. The villain is pretty weak, actually very weak. The performance wasn't all that great but also the character felt like one big blob of cliché, it was something I had already seen dozens of times. Now the PG-13 rating is there and it does not feel right for the most part. This definitely should have been a rated-R movie, but because it's Sony and they looooove money that wasn't an option I guess. Of course it also sets up a sequel, which is something I am seriously getting tired of but in the end I'm just accepting it...Guys, this actually is a very fun and entertaining movie. Yes, the violence isn't as violent as you would like and the villain is very weak, but in the end I could see through all of that and just enjoy a fun relation between Venom and Tom Hardy.I give it a solid 7.2/10!",Venom

Everything, from the writing to the editing to the visual effects/design, even to some of the acting just didn't work.Starting with the latter, Tom Hardy does his best, and when he has some genuine, non-contrived scenes he's actually pretty great. The guy's obviously a great actor, but he has to work with some mindbogglingly dumbly written scenes that even he can't save and he just ends up looking silly. The poor humor is in general one of the main reasons I ended up disliking this movie so much. They were going for some Deadpoolesque humor, but most of it just came off incredibly lame to me. I mainly laughed because of how bizar some of the creative decisions were rather than the humor itself. More even than in the action, this is where the PG-13 rating hurts the movie the most. If you're gonna make gruesome killing try to seem funny, you have to make the humor fit that narrative and you can't do that if you're restricted in what you're allowed to say and show.It's also surprisingly light on action. It's a lot of Tom Hardy acting awkwardly in public and an ocassional CGI hand that slams some guy into a wall. There's one long motor chase scene which was used more as a set of jokes than a good action set piece, an obligatory climactic battle, and that's pretty much it. It was just not very fulfilling. The climactic scene is one huge CGI-fest between two creatures that did not look as good as they should have. It's not like the effects are terrible, but the designs of Venom and particularly Riot just are a little bland and uninteresting.This weird input of action is a result of the film's poor pacing. It takes almost an hour for 'Venom' to actually Venom, and then it rushes the final act and all of a sudden it's over. Many superhero movies make the mistake of cramming in too many villains and plotlines and making the film unnecessarily lengthy and bloated, but 'Venom' takes it to the other extreme. It's incredibly light on story and way too short. Effectively clocking in at only 90 minutes, it should have take 15 to 30 more minutes to develop its storylines further. Particularly Riot as a villain needed more screen time, because he is just kinda suddenly there to give Venom another supernatural creature to fight against. I like the 'doing evil deeds for a good cause' direction they gave Riz Ahmed's character, and I think he's one of the better aspects of the movie, but that whole arc is ruined by Riot turning the story into a generic 'I'm evil and want to do evil things' trope.The symbiotic relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom also could have benefitted from some more depth, particularly to establish why exactly Venom decided to be a good guy after all. Because as much as they were trying to paint Venom as some anti-hero throughout the build-up to this movie, he just ends up full hero at the end. He stops the evil symbiote from carrying out his plan and saves the world, and other than out of self-defense, almost only hurts clearly evil people. That may make him a little more vigilante than superhero, but still pretty much your typical good guy.Finally, as a comparatively minor but still noticable issue, I also did not like the editing of this movie. Many of the transitions between scenes were really sudden, like when Eddie Brock is in the restaurant behaving erratically and the next moment he's having an MRI at the hospital. There are also some scenes that are ended rather abruptly, which I once again attribute to the PG-13 rating, since it's always when something supposedly violent was about to happen. In general, the poor editing really breaks up the flow of the movie, since it jumps around so much in time and space.All in all, I was very disappointed by 'Venom'. All the ingredients of success were there, but Sony once again managed to mess it up somehow. It made a ton of money so undoubtedly there's gonna be a sequel, so I'll end on a positive note: with the obligatory origin story out of the way, it can only get better from here.",Venom
847,KirkFogg,"As a lifelong Venom fan, this movie was a huge disappointment.",5,7 May 2019,"Most people that saw ""Venom"" also saw the trailer, so we knew exactly what we were walking in to see. That is, a poorly thought out cash grab that doesn't follow the rich lore available to it. The trailer definitely displayed early the lack of originality in script or conviction in delivery. It looked wholly generic, and overall cringe inducing. ""Spiderman The Animated Series"" instilled a life long love of the anti-hero Venom in me from the time that I was four years old, so needless to say this movie could have been a dream come true. All of this build up just to say that the movie was pretty horrendous. I'm usually a fan of Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams as actors, but they both really phoned in this performance for what I'm sure was gobs of money. The villain portrayed by actor Riz Ahmed is laughably bad, and maybe the worst performer among the bunch. The final fight is eight minutes of extreme CGI featuring a battle between two extremely similar looking creatures, so you're left watching rapid close ups and quick cutaways of a battle that is very hard to follow on the big screen. All of this aside, it was still fun to see Venom destroying everyone and everything in his path. Those brief moments of thrilling comic violence are representative of the entire 5/10 stars that I would rate this movie.",Venom

The prducers had to get around the Huge issue of the Original Characters story line some way, not Involve Spiderman, secret wars, Klyntar. otherwise any comic book fan should get past these things, go numb a bit then enjoy the movie.

Venom is Brutal, not like Carnage, but a Venom Movie without Blood is laughable.The Actors did a very good Job, that is Fact.But whats with this Story?The first 30 Minutes are boring like Hell, and after that we got some Action Scenes with not that good looking CGI.
Venoms Voice and what they did to his Character is a shame.
A Stupid Alien who dont know what is good or bad.. C´mon guys.I have expected more...Spider Man was way better, The older ones with Tobey Maguire. They had a deep Story, good FX and perfect Actors. (Not anyone likes the Spiderman Movies, but they did a good job).But Venom only has good Actors, nothing more.
Story Garbage, FX Garbage, Character Developement Garbage, no Blood, Dumb Dialoge.. BORING BORING BORING!
Now lets wait for Carnage! Maybe thay make a Movie for Kids. for 6 Years old Kids.Venom is a Slap in the Face for every Venom Fan.

You have to wonder if they are real digging deep to find more and more obscure characters simply because it sells. It's not a bad movie. Mostly entertaining. A bit confusing, especially when they introduced the evil 'vemon' That looked like the good 'venom'. They sounded the same too. But the story was intended it seeolike they could have developed it better to follow where it was going. Overall, nothing really new here, as all these moycover the same story with only a different character. It started to feel like transformers means alien/predator.

Tom Hardy really surprised me, I instantly fell inlove with his character; his vulnerability he portrayed and how insecure his character really was before Venom came along!

With this movie intitulated Venom, the scenary is somehow good, but about 90% of the plot twists and characters's performance is just super clicheic and ordinary.

858,whiterose-54828,Can't See the Appeal...,2,1 September 2021,"The design of Venom is better than the one from Spider-Man 3, he looks like he's straight out of the comics. That is where the good aspects of this movie end for me.Sony had been trying to get a Venom movie made ever since the aforementioned Spider-Man 3. Though I'm a fan of the Venom character, I never particularly felt that he needed his own solo movie but still I remained cautiously optimistic about it. My expectations for Venom weren't particularly high to begin with but somehow it still managed to disappoint me.The first major issue with Venom as a story is the lack of Peter Parker. A big part of both Eddie Brock and Venom's characters is their relationship with Peter Parker/Spider-Man, in fact he is the very reason that the Venom character we know even exists. Take away Spider-Man and you take away a big part of Venom's character and the story that makes him so interesting as an antihero.Since Spider-Man is not in this story, Eddie Brock instead is turned into a generic hero type who lacks the complexity of his comic counterpart. Throughout the movie he reluctantly helps the Venom symbiote whose motivations and loyalty are ambiguous and unclear.The actors give okay performances but feel like they aren't giving it their all. Supposedly Tom Hardy only agreed to be Venom because his son likes the character and it shows.The attempts at humour are cringe inducing and often fall flat. It feels like they were trying to imitate the MCU's style of humour but it honestly feels more like the kind of humour you'd find in a Michael Bay Transformers movie.The villain is forgettable and ultimately just ends up being a silver version of Venom. The CGI in the big fight between the two characters also doesn't look very good.Overall I'm not really sure what everyone sees in Venom that makes it such a masterpiece, they must have been watching a completely different film. Despite my dislike of this Venom movie, I hope they will manage to fix some of these issues in the sequel and perhaps then we can get a worthy big screen adaptation of this character.",Venom

863,Xamalion,Shame it's outside the MCU,10,3 October 2018,"If you read about the difficult way to this movie (it's been in production hell since Spiderman 3), then you have to accomplish that it turned out quite well. Tom Hardy is a really good choice for the role, and he delivers a solid performance as the underdog on his way to become the hero. I really like that they portray him half of the movie as a coward, because when you look at him he's quite an impressive figure. He's likable. I constantly felt the need of hugging him and telliing him ""it's gonna be alright"" until Venom arrives. I didn't know Michelle Williams was in this movie until I saw her, and she is great. Her brief appearance as female Venom made me cheer and wanting more of that. How cool woul it be if both of them would have a symbiont and team up. Riz Ahmed is a really good actor, because I hated him the first moment he appeared on screen. The movie is a bit of a slow burner because they spend over 30 minutes until the fun kicks in, but then it REALLY kicks in. Venom is funny as hell. In my opinion he's the better Rocket, because Rocket always seems forced funny while Venom is purely instinct driven and the funny part occurs in bizzare ways. In comparison Deadpool is eye blink funny, Venom is absolutely dark funny and that's really great. And there we come to the ..ckheads at Sony for cutting out 40 minutes and forcing a PG13 at it. You're the stupidest people on this planet and I hope you die. Seriously. Venom would agree with me, while biting their heads off. And then there is the other ..ckmove of not putting this in the MCU. As I said, Venom is funny and would be a great addition to the family. Especially knowing that the Avengers will come to an end (at least the team as it is now) after the next Infinity War movie and with the introduction of Captain Marvel. I can't stand the fact, that neither Sony or Disney/Marvel give a damn about the fans. It's always about the effing money and what dumb people in ugly suits think.
I hope they will overthink all this and include the character into the MCU, where it belongs.",Venom

866,zahmed_1970,Light Hearted Entertainment ... BUT -->,7,17 October 2018,"To be honest with you, it was not bad, it was light hearted entertainment, kids loved and a laughed and seemed to enjoy more. BUT as for adults at least for me and my wife, something in the movie was troubling, pretty much all new movies that are coming out, have one significant theme that is ""We are running out of Resources, we over Populated and if we continue on this path, we wont be able to survive the next generation, Also that we (humans) are poor designed / weak beings and need enhancements"" This reoccurring theme was also in the Infinity War, the reason Thanos eliminated 50% oflife from the universe .... basically save the resource .... These movie makers are following a very troubling agenda and are conditioning us and the newer generation that we need to depopulate this planet by at least 80% (search Georgia Guide Stones) ... and when IT happens, no one will question or raise a concern ... as we will be conditioned by then and easily accept it.",Venom
867,tilmonhocutt,Changed things from the comic,5,9 April 2019,While deviating from the comic is not ALWAYS bad in this case they pretty much changed waaaaaaaay too much. And the changes were NOT for the better.,Venom
868,johnyskar,Are WE good? Of course we are! Nicely done in all areas and humour included.,9,18 October 2018,"So are we Venom after all? You bet we are. Spiderman is my favorite Superhero character and Venom is the best Villain/Anti-Hero because they have common ground. You know who else is also great because of that? A guy like Venom but red and more crazy, but more on that later. So Venom and Eddie stood up to their own standalone movie and delivered. With the merging of the studios with Disney i don't know how much is Marvel contributing to these movies(Venom, X-Men, Deadpool etc) in comparison to their pure Marvel in the Avengers Universe but the result is a serious movie with a main character who is relatable, strong, kind of a loser and some times pretty funny.Now like most of us, i of course know the Venom character for many videogames and Cartoons but i have not read the old comics that the movie is built on. So i found the different approach alien-ating(wink wink) at first, but got in the mood pretty fast eventually!
Because you know Eddie is the jackass enemy of Peter Parker as Venom is to Spiderman and here he is a likeable guy. He actually reminded me of Spidey with the bad luck in a combo with Hancock in an antihero manner. Anyway i think Michelle Williams's character Anne is kinda irritating unlike her female counterparts in Spidey's side but maybe she'll change later.The movie had an origin story that didn't drag out, some strong action scenes with great visuals and sounds and to my surprise various jokes and funny moments! If the movie was R rated it would probably touch the Deadpool lines of humour that would suit it's style but who knows. I would like if Venom had the Spiderman style with the spider symbol and swinging but i didn't mind at all. Only thing was at the end in the last fight scene that is kinda messy cause all of the CGI but i guess you can't avoid a minimum use of that in this type of movie. Great acting overall from Hardy, the dark role suits him and Venom is an awsome antihero after all! The movie rolls pretty easily and the time passes by enjoyably. Now that red guy i talked about earlier, will be represented by a Marvel-ous(ok enough with the puns) actor and will surely bring Carnage(last one ☺ ) in the second movie and i think he as an antagonist will elevate the whole thing to new limits! Cause you know who is just about crazy as Venom but even more? Cletus Kasady, as a human that is... Now imagine what Woody Harrelson will bring to the table with this persona and what result we will have with the combination of the Symbiot.✍ Great job, and what amplifies the movie's image even more are the reviews that brings you to the ground, because i think it was very good anyway, but when i went to watch it with low expectations today i found it even better than that. Will wait for the sequel with great interest and who knows, if Venom makes an appearance in another movie(cause sadly this didn't happen here with Spidey) that would be guaranteed fun. Maybe some reinforcements for Avengers? ;) 📝:9/10",Venom
869,www-afzala1,"Fun and enjoyable film, but could've benefitted an R rating",8,6 October 2018,"For the last decade, we finally get a faithful adaptation of the character Venom, after the Spider-man 3 flop, I always wonder if Topher would reprise as Venom in Spider-man 4 or a spin-off Sony was planning at the time, however due to their misfortune they had to reboot the film series with yet another flop. After Spidey was brought to the MCU, Sony decided to resurrect the Venom film.Sorry for the rambling, I've seen the film today and I can say it was quite enjoyable but it was no masterpiece. Tom Hardy convinced me that he can play a way better version of Eddie Brock/Venom than Topher Grace, especially the relation between Eddie and the symbiote was a great idea as we can see how they interact, Venom was much bigger (which looks closely to the comics) and always say ""we"" unlike Topher's ver.The plot was consistent and explains into detail about the symbiotes and the main antagonist's goals, what isn't consistent is it's tone, as it looks like a horror film but acts as an Action-Comedy (I suppose it's a comic book film, but the trailers tricked me into thinking it's a horror film), don't get wrong the comedy is fine and it's not off putting but it would benefit more if it went into detail with horror and violence to balance it out.The main antagonist looks too much like a nice guy (I suppose that's his way of deception lol) and the Eddie's GF is kind of forgettable, however I will say that the film's action is pretty good (although it looks bit tamed) and the CG for the symbiotes look great.Overall I had fun with this movie, but I'm not satisfied due to the lack of horror, violence and more character development and I have yet to see an uncut edition on Blu-Ray (heard 40 mins was cut from the film to keep it pg-13/15), but on the bright side Kletus Cassidy a.k.a Carnage appears right at the end of credits, a hint towards a sequel perhaps (lets hope it's much darker and scarier) along with a nice sneak peek look at Into the Spider-Verse film.",Venom
870,briz_boy_10,Pleasantly Surprised!,7,3 October 2018,"When I first found out Sony would be taking control of this film I was cautious because I wasn't much of a fan of the amazing spiderman films but im glad to say im very relieved that this film wasn't as bad as as those.Again, I was cautious because of the critics slating this movie but lets face it 95% of critics just like to fit in with other critics. They either ALL love something or ALL hate something. But anyway on with the review...The film tends to sort of have two halves to it. The first half we spend a lot of time with Eddie Brock. We see the ups and downs of his relationship with his girlfriends, his attitude towards his work and those around him, and how he copes with these kind of things. The 1st half helps us to build an understanding of Brock. It might be a little slow at times whilst Carlton Drakes story at this point is kind of a subplot but when these two stories meet, that's when we get the second part.The second part is where the real fun begins. We're eventually introduced to Venom. The best part about this, and one of the standout things of the overall film, is the constant interactions between Brock and Venom. It's humorous and enjoyable to watch even if it is a little cheesy at times.The action is fairly enjoyable but not the best and there are some parts which feel a bit rushed particularly towards the climax of the film.The characters for the most part are interesting. I liked the dynamic between Hardy and Williams even if they don't have the best chemistry I've seen of on screen couples. Riz Ahmed does a good job as the villain but his character/s are a little bit uninteresting and disappointing.The film obviously has a few negatives. For example the plot seemed a bit thin and boring at times whereas i feel the makers could've gave us more to sink our teeth into. It almost feels like they hesitated when deciding what direction to take this story in. Another negative is the pacing. Whilst I enjoyed the first half it does move a little slow and then the second half seems to go too fast (partially due to the way the films edited.Overall i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and hope they do make a sequel or trilogy. As always there is a mid-credit scene which was satisfying so stay for that. If you try not to focus too much on the fact spiderman isn't in this movie you'll definitely enjoy it more.

The movie is barely 2 hours long, and the first 30-40 mins could've been focused into a 10 minute introduction.I would've loved to see more action of venom, his powers and conflict with human morale make this movie good, but there is just too little of the good stuff and too much of the boring stuff. In one fight you just see venom pushing bad guys arround like toys...over and over again. They should've tried for more interesting and unique ways to show his power then brute strength over and over again.Yes, the acting is good, Tom Hardy is great we know that.

Tom Hardy was the ideal choice to play Eddie Brock, the CGI is so well done if people didn't know that the creatures in the movie didn't exist they'd probably think that they were actually there.

Skip It (D+) *new grade*
Not as completely irredeemable from positives on this rewatch which it has a fun but crazy over-the-top performance by Tom Hardy as well as some good acting from Michelle Williams, Scott Haze and the rest of the cast. The score by Ludwig Gorannsson is still fun to listen to and the banter between Eddie and Venom is still fun. I still like the action sequences and cinematography here too. But my biggest praise is Venom's look and it is a major improvement over his look in Spider-Man 3But between those positives, this movie still has the big issues that keeps this from being a great stand-alone Venom movie such as the inconsistency in the editing at times especially in the action sequences (which are still fun but problem is, some of them are not cut right) and most of the movie at times and the editing is pretty bad at times. The script by Kelly Marcel (and the 2 writers of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle & The Next Level) is really terrible and this movie suffers from Sony's usual studio meddling as well as no mention of the web singer, Spider-Man himself which was and still is desperately needed. Riot is a very disappointing villain with no clear motivation despite Riz Ahmed's best efforts but his performance is incredibly over-the-top. Not to mention there's some bad CGI here in placesBut of all of the problems this movie has, it's biggest and major problem is it's PG-13 rating really hurting the film's full potential and desperately needing for a hard R and the extra 40 minutes that was cut.Not the worst movie ever but still one of my least favorite superhero movies ever and one of the worst of last decade but it does have enough merit to boost the grade up. 4.5/10 (D+)",Venom
885,alchemist-77127,Be Real,8,11 October 2018,"The start of the film is a bit slow and it takes just a little too long before the moment starts what you have been waiting for.When it does start you end up in a rollercoaster action movie that makes it all worthwile. Especially the interaction between Venom and Eddie is magnificent.Due to the long beginning, the plot and the fact that there is already so much other spectaculair known Marvel movies this one is just a little under the top.9 or 10 for this movie is unrealistic in comparison to some greater titles if you keep it real.

886,Stenian,"Too much Eddie Brock, not much Venom. Pathetic and weak villain.",5,11 June 2021,"I know what you'll say, ""but this is an origins movie and so you'll get to see more of Eddie"". Well, yeah, but the film focused on Eddie Brock's life way too much in the first hour. They might have well should have shown him pooping in his toilet (they probably did). I really didn't care much about him in all honesty, and much of the scenes of him at the beginning which dragged. Even Tom Hardy, who is a good actor, didn't really rivet me to his character.I mean, Eddie Brock was never a famous or popular comic book character anyway. He is no Joker, Peter Parker, The Riddler or Bruce Wayne for that matter. Why would we need to sit down and watch Brock for like 50 minutes? I'm pretty sure most people came to watch this film to see Venom. And the film should have gotten on with it as quick as possible. But it just went on and on with Eddie Brock's apartment life.And that pathetic villain, Carleton Drake. Not sure if it was the character or the guy portraying him. But I think it was a mix of the two. He was so unlikable and ""uncool"" for a villain. A try-hard, typical and cliched villain at best.As soon as Venom appears and becomes more prominent, the film starts to get entertaining. I enjoyed Eddie's chemistry with his ex girlfriend Anne (Michelle Williams). I enjoyed her performance as well. Let's hope the sequel will be much better and, I believe, we would probably get to see more Venom.",Venom

One is the little intro to Eddie Brock's life and the other is when he gained his powers and running around the city and just jumping from cars to cars. So the second part was all about Venom. The villain was easily defeatable, it's not a question. But I still think that it was a pretty good movie.",Venom

Tom Hardy's acting was good as always and the film has a nice modern approach to it as well.It has got me excited for Venom: Let There Be Carnage which is going to be a very good film as Carnage is a lot stronger than Riot so it will hopefully be a much better fight.There isn't too much to say about this film really.

This movie does an excellent job at making you sympathize with Eddie Brock without taking away from his charter. Venom is funny in this movie which I was surprised that they managed to pull off so well. But where this movie does some perfect things, it has some significant flaws. The writing is not the best, and some of the scenes have some horrible editing. Venom was trying to make itself an R-Rated film through the trailers, and it would have benefited from it. I am not saying make a movie that is as dark or violent as ""Logan"" was but make a film that represents the charter Venom for what it truly is. But getting ready and excited to see the sequel Venom: Let there be Carnage. I am starting to now get more curious as to what rating they will give that movie. Even if the film does not receive an R rating, I will still see it.",Venom
893,bugwyrus,"VENOM Rules, avoid poisonous critics :)",8,23 October 2018,"Venom is a raw and mature movie, with a great constructed plot. The script is very adult, the characters well written.
Eddie Brock is the Antihero, with two personalities standing out. Brock has a moral compass in a gray area, can break the law if it suits him but he has a good heart.
He fights the symbiote Venom within him in the beggining, but he acepts its true nature, because they both realize they need each other. It's a comic relief to see their interactions.
The True Villain Carlton Drake aka Riot, is a great villian with no regards for human life, even if he works in the LIFE Foundation.
But his motivations in name of science are plausible and make sense.
The movie is slow paced in the first hour of the movie it's true, but because it wants to tell us a story of a man in a downward spiral that looses everything, and the motivations behind the Life Foundation, and that is made masterfully.
The rest of the movie has good action scenes, a great epic Chase, and the CGI is ok but not the best. I've seen better special FX in other movies. The ending of the movie is good, but a little rushed out, the fight between Venom and Riot could have been even better.
Kids that love Avengers or the new Stars wars Trilogy wont like it, because they want cheap thrills and laughs.
But i can say this, since the Dark Night i dont see a Superhero movie with such good story. It is Marvels darkest movie, for me it could be even Darker and more violent, but the PG13 tag, stops the movie from trully shinning.
If Spiderman were here, it would be the best Spiderman movie for sure.

I went in expecting another Suicide Squad mess, but 90% of the movie was thoroughly enjoyable.Is it perfect and Oscar worthy? Of course not, it's a Venom movie. What it is, is a good fun time.To start with, the trailer completely misses the tone of the movie. This is a dark buddy comedy and you should know that going in.There's bad CGI, a forgettable villain and an anticlimactic final act. These are all true. However, if you want a funny, character driven origin story, this will be for you.Hardy gives one of my favourite of his performances; you can tell he had so much fun playing the role and his two characters (Brock and Venom) bounce off each other so well.Think of a very ""aware of itself"" Venom story with clear influences from both Deadpool and your favourite buddy cop movie, with a dark twist, and that's what you're getting.

900,yasan_parto,It's just sad seeing so many good actors in this!,3,16 August 2020,"The movie was as disappointing as I had heard it would be. And it's just sad seeing so many great actors being under-utilized. Riz Ahmed and Michelle Williams, two of the finest actors of the industry, are shrunk down to playing one-dimensional undeveloped characters mumbling cheesy comic-like lines such as ""Have a nice life"". Not even that cheesy line works in a movie like this because the movie is so inferior in structure to all the good comics we have seen lately such as those of Marvel who has defined the formula to success for making a comic film.Tom Hardy brings his all to the role and puts his natural temper into good use in a couple of scenes but even then, his sudden fall into decay and losing everything just after doing a controversial interview seems pretty unbelievable for even the least film savvy audience. Also the fact that Venom and Riot have plain monstrous-like voices that every child would mimic when doing a monster impression really makes those characters as plain as ever.For the most part though, Tom Hardy and his versatility as an actor carry the film. That plus good visual effects which make for some entertaining scenes to watch like the street chase scene, are the reasons why I am giving this film even those 3 stars.",Venom

The effects are nice and the actors aren't as cringe inducing as in most other super hero movies.Also it doesn't rely on wise crack jokes every 10 seconds which seems to be what every comic book movie is doing these days but it is funny at certain times and even had my son laughing.Go see it, much better than the super hero nonsense that is being force fed to us every month elsewhere.If you trust the bad reviews simply search this movies reception, it crushed at the box office...if it was so horrible it wouldn't have set worldwide records.",Venom

Once he actually gets the symbiote, he shines as the only character who realises he's in a comedy and delivers every line perfectly. Unfortunately, all the supporting cast play their rolls so straight-laced that scenes lacking the title character and Eddie are often plain boring. The exception here is the villain, who unintentionally funny by being so unrealistically evil that you can't take him seriously. The CGI and humour are both of mixed quality, and the after-credits scene is seriously groan inducing.

917,sheepfood,Is this a new low in Marvel?,4,13 October 2018,"Someone said ""Venom itsn't a Marvel movie"".
Yup. It's WORSE than your average Marvel movie.I know acting might not be one of the more important thing in this kind of movie but oh boy it sure sucks. This movie contains some of the most unbelievable characters on screen. Drake doesn't act and feel like a leader of any foundation, he just walk around acting angry and spoilt (and the scene with the kids in the beginning makes him look like some low lever employee in the foundation). And the girlfriend is even worse. Zero believe-ability. Even a ""rented girlfriend"" can act better. There were ABOUT TO GET MARRIED and there isn't a slight tint of sadness of regret during all the breakups etc. Apparently bonds can just come and go like some weekend fling. Either this is some American culture which I don't understand, or the acting is just not there.Next, the humor parts are embarrassing. Some humor in any movie is ok. But not the way it was done in Venom. It gets incredibly cliche from the middle towards the end of the movie. In the beginning there's still some people laughing at the bad jokes in the theater (you know, those people who can laugh at anything), but even they stopped laughing towards the end. OK, at least they only brought these on towards the end, else people (like me) would have left the theater half way. SMART.The worst thing is .. these stupid humor were being performed on Venom himself .... oh boy these destroys everything. Venom was actually kind of cool (with the intelligence and the voice) and I might actually watch a part 2 just to see that but now .. NAY. Forget it. I have a personal theory: Any movie that uses these kind of bad humor doesn't have any confidence at all that the movie will succeed. It's like using sprinkles on top of very bad food. If you have them there, it at least looks complete to sell.Last time, even bad movie had some standards.

The pacing of the movie was the most obvious to me because Act 1 seemed to take forever and I was just sat their waiting for Eddie to become Venom but then Act 2 flew by and we hardly had enough time to meet Venom until it was Act 3 and their was the big CGI fight between Venom and Riot.

Yes he's a good actor, but not convincing as an ""investigative reporter""; more like a bike mechanic. Likewise Riz Ahmed is not the typical ruthless billionaire businessman. I would have reversed their roles. Besides the stock characters, the least convincing part of the movie was the plot, which moved at a snail's pace to a predictable conclusion, the only highlights being an amusing restaurant scene and a chase.

928,pantelisandreou98,Entertaining even though generic,6,13 October 2018,"In a world where marvel studios releases a successful addition after another venom comes like a leftover from the past decade, but i have to say i enjoyed most of the end result.
Firstly venom looks great in this one.. the design is mostly on point and the cgi looked fine, nothing extraordinary but i was expecting it to look a lot worse and i'm kind of of impressed that i liked it that much. Sure the big white spider symbol is missing (such as every connection with spiderman) but it didn't exactly distracted me from enjoying the rest of the representation. But i have to give major props to Tom Hardy because he is truly talented and he proves it once more with venom, far from his best work but he can do no wrong. Loved the way venom and Eddie interacted and that it had some pretty funny elements not all of them landed but at least half of them were good.
As for the tone of the film it's a little messy going from being funny to a wannabe horror movie with mystery. The trailers were not even close of what we got. I expected more darker moments and tone overall.
One of my biggest complaints i have with this is that i needed to see venom sooner and more, i get that it's an origins film and they need to establish on Eddie's character but the whole story wasn't that interesting to begin with so the film before venom showed up felt that it was dragging and when we finally have venom it's only for short periods of time but can't deny that they're still effective and enjoyble moments.
The villain Carlton Drake on the other hand was a total let down and it could have been so much more. I knew it from thw trailers that he was going to be the one-dimensional character that is very bad for absolute no reason and when he finally has the symbiote attached to him it's cool but it felt extremely rushed with moments that were obviously missing.
Michelle Williams plays the girlfriend.. yes she is that character and nothing more.. she does nothing to the whole movie. We can totally erase her and would have no impact on the story. It's a sheme because she is really a great actress. Plus I can't imagine her being with a guy like Tom Hardy.
Overall Venom is far from the greatest super-hero (in this case anti-hero) film but if you avoid and don't think about all the problems it's a basic origins story with many entertaining moments and miles better from the one we got from Topher Grace in Spiderman 3.

933,Dimitris_Kountouris,Gimme the sequel already!,7,24 November 2018,"First of all, I'm reviewing ""Venom"" after watching it for the 2nd time.The first time I was a little bit confused. I liked everything about Eddie and Venom. Although Tom Hardy is my favorite actor, I was kinda worried about his performance from what I saw in the trailers, but he was absolutely great once again.The problem with my first viewing was that I was expecting something else and probably for good reason, since one can clearly see that they were going for an R-rated action/horror anti-hero movie. There are elements of horror, but my guess is that there were some reshoots and/or minutes cut from the final product.But the second viewing changed my mind, due to the fact that I can be fine with the tone changing from scene to scene, thanks to the characters. I was like ""hmmm... they're showing the spaceship crashing and then a sinister symbiote getting into people and wrecking some havoc in a street. Makes sense to be horror-like"" and then ""oh, there's Eddie. He's just messing around, so why not have a comedic vibe?"". You feel me?Also, there are some ""plot holes"" that many people were complaining about that are not really there such as ""why did Drake send explosive drones since he didn't want to kill Eddie?"". No, he wanted Venom back, it's afterwards that he wants him alive.And, of course, the after credit scene sets up the perfect sequel, which will probably be out in October 2020 and I guess I'm gonna rewatch the first one a few times to fulfill my appetite for Venom.... or human heads!",Venom

936,ranentrudgett,You will only like it if you're a Marvel fan.,5,3 December 2018,"If you remove any association with Marvel from this movie and just judge it for what it is at face value, what you're left with is a very mediocre film with no redeeming factors, it's a typical ""alien that infects hosts"" movie, it tries to be a comedy but fails to deliver even a slight chuckle from me the majority of the time, the CGI on a technical level is just bad, it might look cool sure, but it is technically bad, there are moments in this film when i wasn't sure if I was watching an animated movie or a live action one, the acting is below par, the story is very predictable and shallow, probably the best aspect of this movie is Tom Hardy and even he is not that great in this, which is disappointing as I know Tom is a great actor.For what it is, I give it a 5, but again, if you're a Marvel fan you might form a different opinion.",Venom

Or watch it - what do I care? haha All I know is I waited for months to see this movie and was cautious of the hype both for and against it. Well, I have to say, it was way worse than I ever expected. Tom Hardy, normally such a great actor, seemed like a first quarter drama student. Riz Ahmed & Michelle Williams are both great too - but not here. Williams was phoning it in from frame one. There's no real reason for the carnage that ensues either - it's all just big dumb, loud and graphic. It would have been a hit in about 1993, but today - I'm sorry - it flat out SUCKS. Three stars just cuz it's kinda fun to see a character I grew up with and frankly, he does look pretty good in a few scenes - not many, but a few. And the whole ""not in the MCU"" thing - that's just the cherry on top.",Venom
940,karimbelkayed,Another Spider Man Flick,7,21 December 2018,"This movie is just a generic B-movie action but with Marvel's comedy (jokes that aren't funny or relevant). The first half was actually fun, everything felt natural thanks to Tom Hardy's acting and cool CGI, I thought the critics were wrong on what they said, but the second half proved me wrong, it was the most cliché movie I have ever watched in 2018, I didn't believe how the hell these Oscars-nominee actors were that bad, maybe it was the script I dunno, but thing is...it was bad. My advice: keep you expectations low, I , like everyone else was hyped because of the cool trailer, but I was dissapointed.",Venom
941,richardgeuter,"""I'm killing you, I'm so sorry.""",3,3 November 2018,"At its core, ""Venom"" is the story of Tom Hardy making friends with an intelligent goo from outer space. That earns some points for weirdness. Sadly, the movie as a whole is not bold enough to fully embrace its weirdness, constantly undercutting the inherent darkness and brutality of the Venom character with cheesy humor and tired superhero movie tropes.There are some things that work okay in this movie, though none work exceptionally well. The cast is maybe its strongest asset, but makes the uninspired script all the more annoying. Seeing Michelle Williams, an amazing actress who has been incredible in almost everything I ever saw her in, be reduced to ""the girl"" is saddening. Riz Ahmed, though I admire his being cast as the mad scientist character in theory, is very believable as the scientist but could have been a lot madder. And Tom Hardy is clearly trying to give Eddie Brock some dimensionality, but in some scenes, it seems like he's not taking this whole thing very seriously. I can't blame him.The script to a superhero movie doesn't need to be devoid of any clichés or familiar tropes, but if it employs them in such a liberal manner as in ""Venom,"" there needs to be some self-awareness in it. Ruben Fleischer seems like the perfect director to make a script like this one work, because ""Zombieland"" was a very self-aware movie, and on top of that, it had good sense of character and even drama, in spite of its inherent silliness. But for some reason, he can't do the trick for ""Venom."" I could forgive the film for its other flaws if he had played it more for camp, but as it is, the movie seems like an unintentional parody. You might enjoy it on that level.Much of the dialogue, especially in the first half, is filled with cheesy one-liners and clichéd jokes that, while they did get a few chuckles from me, it was mostly for the wrong reasons. There is a particularly painful scene of Eddie Brock embarrassing himself in a fancy restaurant that reminded me of early-2000s mainstream comedies in the worst possible way. Overall, although a few of the funny scenes in the film are genuinely entertaining, it's mainly because of the
talented actors in the piece and the details they bring to the table. But generally, the jokes in ""Venom"" more often fail than they don't.Another aspect of the film that could have redeemed some of its narrative and tonal flaws is the action. But here lies maybe the biggest weakness of the film: there is not that much action in it, and what little we get is awfully staged and edited. Even during the one-on-one fights in the first act, the director fails to make the stunts look like Tom Hardy is actually doing them -- which he might have, in which case this flaw is all the more unforgivable. Later, when the action goes bigger, we are treated to an atrocious chase sequence in which the filmmakers completely fail to give us any sense of location, so all we see are random shots of cars, faces, and streetlights, with no indication as to where those things are in relation to our main character. And for the finale, they decide to pull out every tired superhero movie cliché in the book. I could list them, but that might count as a spoiler, though if you've seen any superhero movie in the last ten years, suffice it to say, you will not be surprised by anything in the last 20 minutes of ""Venom."" Or rather, the last 40 minutes, because the credits sequence alone is 20 minutes long, during which the filmmakers saw fit to give us an almost comically formulaic mid-credits scene (if you consider the fact that the movie has a mid-credits scene a spoiler, you might enjoy the last fight scene) and an ad for an upcoming kids' movie. Classy.Although I did not like ""Venom,"" it should be noted that I did have fun watching it. It is, like ""Suicide Squad"" two years ago, an entertaining trainwreck, and for that matter, it might even be one of those cheesy blockbusters that might be redeemed in couple years' time. But today, it feels very derivative and uninspired.",Venom
942,tww35,Enjoyable romp,6,5 October 2018,"Just watched Venom at the cinema 40 minutes ago, went in with real trepidation and fearing another terrible experience after recently watching The Predator. But I was pleasantly surprised, Venom is an enjoyable action romp, Tom Hardy and Riz Ahmed do great jobs portraying their characters, and Michelle Williams does well in a fairly thin role.For once a movie that doesn't bother with 40 minutes of everyone's back story, which was a positive, the story kept moving along at just the right pace although I suppose you could argue this was at the expense of fleshed out story telling?Just when you were thinking hmm could do with some Venom round about now, the movie delivers, and it pretty much keeps on going until the end.San Francisco looks fabulous throughout.Only downsides? The end 'fight' sequence is very difficult to follow and the twist in the plot is bordering on ridiculous (but necessary).But I do recommend watching Venom, definitely a film to make your own mind up and not be swayed by reviews. 6/10 possible case for 7/10.",Venom
943,erichuntersamuels,It's great,9,7 January 2019,"I don't know why it has low rating, maybe because people are addicted to overrated marvel movies. It's not like any other hero movie completely different, in some ways similar to handcock.

So I guess you could say I know something about Marvel movies growing up with 2 older brothers. As I grew up, I steered clear of anything to do with action/ marvel movies, cause I was sick of the typical story lines. But I saw this for the first time last night, and my hope was resorted. Being a 2 year media / graphics student, I can also say that anything dealing with that department was amazing. I would go see this again. 
Do yourself a favour!",Venom
945,Noah_Biondi,Not the toxic bite the critics think it is,7,18 October 2018,"This is a non-spoiler review. Don't worry, you're safe with me.Venom, if anything, is far from a perfect movie. It's not even a little bit amazing. But what do you expect from a popcorn blockbuster trying to win over Spider-Man fans? Venom is still a fun, action-packed, and even kind of good superhero movie that will not disappoint.What's the story? Journalist Eddie Brock is trying to take down Carlton Drake, the notorious and brilliant founder of the Life Foundation. While investigating one of Drake's experiments, Eddie's body merges with the alien Venom -- leaving him with superhuman strength and power. Twisted, dark and fueled by rage, Venom tries to control the new and dangerous abilities that Eddie finds so intoxicating.A field this movie does great at is the action sequences. I feel like these are some very well-put together action scenes that are very exciting and engaging. Whenever you see Eddie Brock transforming into Venom, it not only gives a sense of intimidation, but it also prepares you for a wild action-packed battle. Another thing this film does great is the visual style. Not only is the production design, the cinematography, and the symbiote particles very stunning to look at, but they also make the action scenes look AND feel even more awesome. The storyline, on the other hand, well... it's alright. I'm not gonna go into spoiler territory or anything, but it's not the most engaging story; the action does the job. As for the acting, I think the performances are superb, especially casting Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock. He does a great job with the character, but a nitpick would go onto Venom himself- whenever we hear a voice-over by Venom, it sounds pretty weird and, at times, even laughable. One final thing I'd like to analyze is the music. The composer, Ludwig Göransson, who also did the music for Black Panther and Creed, does a pretty good job over here. Not that Venom is his best score or anything, but it still gets you excited for the action, and it knows when the film transitions into a serious moment or a wild moment.In conclusion, Venom is enjoyable, cool, and quite underrated superhero film that deserves more praise and respect. You can tell that there's effort put into it, even if at times they try too hard with the film. If you like the Spider-Man comics with Venom in them (I know I'm a fan of the Venom comics), you'll have a fun time at the movies with good ol' Eddie Brock. I feel like this movie was a love letter to haters of Spider-Man 3, which underplayed Venom by a lot, so if you hated Spider-Man 3 because there wasn't enough Venom, there's plenty of Venom in this film, so I recommend seeing it for yourself. Hope you'll like the movie!",Venom
946,bigtone-74885,Very entertaining,8,28 October 2018,"I admit that the opening scene where the spaceship burns up on entering the atmosphere and is visually falling apart on camera, then to be shown sitting in a couple of pieces in tact on the ground, with the important alien contents intact also; ... .I went mmm, oh dear. Stretching the bounds is perfectly fine in movies, but then there is just silly.Then, we are shown in the Life Corporation that the symbiote aliens struggle to live with their hosts, with the hosts continuously dying. But behold, the symbiote that survived the spaceship crash by hiding in one of the crew members, then successfully lives and fully integrates with every single other host it contacts by chance. Again, a simple thread of consistency a movie maker throws out for the sake of a story line.So, that's the irritating bit.But I love the Marvel movies. This one was different but nearly as much fun and exciting. It was also surprisingly funny which I simply did not expect. My girls sitting next to me in the cinema starting laughing at one point, and I was like, oh shhh. Then the next thing all the cinema was laughing also, and I realised I was taking it too seriously.I liked the action, I liked the humor, especially from Venom, it really was quite witty in a simple way. Tom Hardy's performance was great, he was perfect for the role.Great movie, great setup for sequels. Worth going to see.",Venom
947,casperlowe,Not what I was expecting,7,12 January 2019,"I went into this film with the full intention of hating it and boy did I come out surprised. The obvious main strength of this film is the performance of Tom Hardy, particularly strong in the scenes where he is first joing with Venom. He was comical without being absurd or dumbing it down and also played it with a slight touch of madness in his eyes which I adored. The film itself is ok and so are the other performers although the typical 2d style bad guy brought the film down considerably in my opinion.
However as I stated at the start of this review it's all about Venom/Tom Hardy double act that really excels this otherwise average film.",Venom

949,claudio645,"Sony/Disney does another Solo, only worse",4,7 October 2018,"Solo was a mildly fun but forgetable movie. Venom is fun at times but ends up leaving you wondering how much better this could have been. Tom Hardy is probably the only one who stands out at all, trying his best to make this work. The others aren't bad actors at all. Their parts are just so two-dimensional that there's nothing to work with. The love of his life drops him and moves onto another live-in boyfriend after one incident despite having been there through much worse with Brock in NY. The villain's actions based on his motivation make no sense. Finally, despite being a major Spider-Man villain, there's absolutely no connection to the webcrawler right down to completely changing Venom's origin story. There's the feel that Sony & Disney would like for this to be a part of the MCU (there's even the obligatory Stan Lee sighting and the credit scene involving another big Spider-Man nemesis) but it still divorces itself from everything else MCU. This is the kind of product I would expect from DC and not Marvel...and yes, while it's Sony they go to great trouble to remind us multiple times this is in association with Marvel.",Venom

Imagine putting such good effort into all the seperate bits of a film, script, score, special effects, casting etc and someone giving you 1 out of 10!! - honestly!!Rant over! - ok, what's it like?
Well it's entertaining enough if you like this sort of movie ( and I do!! ) but you just get the feeling that it's good but not quite there in several areas. As others have said, the casting could've been better ( apart from Tom ) and I just felt the jokey tone was overdone in parts - the bike chase was almost slapstick.
I would have liked it if it had been R rated and more adult.
It's obvious a lot of time & thought went into the special effects but sometimes it looks just too digital.Also wondered why the bad guy had to ask who had gained entry into his labs - didn't he have security cameras?!!So there you go - after the film I felt I had had a good time and it was an ok movie and wasn't disappointed I had chosen to watch it.",Venom
953,Ginsengjin,A hint of depth but mostly shallow movie.,7,8 December 2018,It's a typical super hero movie. The protagonist is a guy the audience feels bad for and we get to see him cope as he discovers changes in his new superhero body. It's all a very generic story wrapped in a new shiny wrapper. The only original part of this movie was the idea of symbiosis and the way venom is trying to make brock whole again even though he seems like the bad guy. I really wish they focused on that part of character development because that is much more interesting than the amount of fight scenes they tried to pack into this movie.It's entertaining overall and worth watching but no where near a master piece.,Venom

The film is completely different from the trailer -- much much better. And the mid credit scene make it even more better!It was quite fun, entertaining, thrilling film. I hope it was R rated but Sony decided to cut it down to a PG-13, for any potential tieins with the Spider-Man MCU. The action was cool but the villain is cliche and no surprise at all.

962,Neonfinity,A studio experiment gone alright,6,9 October 2018,"Venom is a 2018 Sci-Fi Horror Action film starring one of my favorite current actors Tom Hardy, along with Riz Ahmed and Michelle Williams. The film was produced and distributed by Sony with little to no input by Marvel Studios and saw it on opening weekend.After a space probe containing symbiotic lifeforms crashes in Malaysia, one escapes while the others are intact. The corporation belonging to the probe is now being investigated by journalist Eddie Brock (Hardy) who botches an interview with the corporation's CEO (Ahmed). Trouble ensues, leading Eddie getting one of the symbiotes inside him named Venom.The acting and story are somewhat subpar with the film. Tom Hardy leads with a questionable accent but is mostly made up with Eddie and Venom's relationship. The CGI is nothing spectacular but perfectly captures what it sets out to do. That and the film sometimes changes tones to a comedy which worked for me but was still jarring.Venom has done well at the box office, setting records for October and whatnot and has received divisive reception. I can't speak for either side of the critics or fanboys since I found the film good but not great. It was not overall boring and there is plenty of fun to be had with it.Overall, I give Venom a 6/10",Venom

But Tom Hardy tries his best and does succeed in spots. Helps that he is likeable. Guess after the success of the first Deadpool, the memo has gone around to include a smart-alecky character, which is what Venom is or tries to be here. Which means, there's no real fear for Venom/Tom at any point in time (I mean Venom's kyrptonite is TWO kryptonites? High decibels AND fire coz they realised high decibles was meh). Not sure about Michelle Williams. Superficially speaking, she's not as attractive as the usual love-interests in Superheo flicks but I did like how her doctor boyfriend was cast as warm and friendly, even genuinely concerned. Nett nett, it's better than the turd that was Deadpool 2 but not a home run. The sequel looks promising with the Woody Harrelson set up. And oooh, nice Spidey clip at the end.

965,raa-55017,"Far from great, but very enjoyable",5,8 October 2018,"Initially, I was pretty exited for Venom. There was enormous potential here for a dark, unique and complex story, and I, like a lot of others, was interested to see how Sony would handle this new Spider-verse of theirs, despite the lack of an actual Spider-Man. My excitement began to deflate, however, when the film's rating came out. The choice to make this film PG-13 seemed odd, having seen the recent success of R-rated antihero movies such as Deadpool and Logan. Then, as the premiere date neared, the abysmal ratings began pouring out from the internet. The film stands at an atrocious 31% on Rotten Tomatoes and has a 33 Metascore, which disappointed me. Nevertheless, as a fan of the Venom character, I went and saw the film anyway, bracing myself to see a disaster.Having seen Venom yesterday, I can say it in no way deserves the horrible score it got on Rotten Tomatoes. Sure, the movie has tons of problems, but there is a lot to enjoy here as well. It has it's moments, and is by far one of the most entertaining films I've seen this year.First, the negative. The blaring problem here is the script. The plot is extremely cliché, and the awful dialogue made me want to leave the theater and bang my head against a wall. Some of the lines seemed as if they were written by a 10-year-old. I often found myself laughing out loud at the delivery of some of the dialogue. The script's handling of the characters was also very poorly done. Tom Hardy does an exceptional job, but his character of Eddie Brock and the characters around him are so poorly contrived. Nobody has any sort of character arc, and our main protagonist is written completely backwards. He begins the film as a cocky, arrogant, and awkward reporter, only to end the film the exact same way. Michelle Williams's character was maddeningly boring and her performance was dull. You felt no chemistry whatsoever between the two leads. The villain is another glaring negative. While Riz Ahmed is a fantastic actor, his portrayal of Carlton Drake, the head of the sinister Life Foundation, felt extremely cliché and formulated. Drake is given almost zero motivation for his actions, and is not interesting in the slightest. He interacts very little with our main hero, then does ridiculous things towards the end that make little sense.Now I'll head into the positives of the film. The bright spot of Venom is no doubt Tom Hardy's performance. He gives 110% to this role and goes way over the top. The dynamic between the Venom symbiote and Eddie Brock, and the back-and-forth exchange between these two is no doubt another highlight of the film. Despite my wanting them to go in a darker direction, the dialogue between the two lended for some pretty funny moments. The action scenes are pretty well done excluding the final fight between Eddie and Carlton Drake, which had too much going on and was often times hard to see what was happening.Overall, the film is covered in problems but enjoyable nonetheless. Its damn entertaining once Venom makes his appearance. I'd recommend this movie as it doesn't deserve the terrible reviews critics have given it.",Venom

I've heard plenty of people say that it's ""the worst movie of 2018!"" or give it 3 out of 10 or something. But I was actually really surprised seeing it.THE THINGS I LIKEI like the design of Venom, it doesn't have a huge symbol on his chest which I was happy to see.The way the symbiotes look on their own, I mean they look terrifying even as a moving puddle.Tom Hardy cause he's Tom Hardy.The guy who plays Carlton Drake was actually alright.THE THINGS I DON'T LIKEI didn't really like the CGI, it wasn't great but it wasn't bad.Riot was just another giant grey villain who even had the same voice actor as Venom like WTF!!Venom dies at the end but is back in the next scene?!I know I said I liked Tom Hardy but his performance is just average.Michelle Williams' hair.The plot was also kind of weird but it doesn't belong in either section.The movie is good enough so watch it if you want I don't really care!",Venom

973,Joshumms,Fun movie without the fun,3,17 October 2021,Venom seems like it's supposed to be a fun movie but they really just rip the fun out of it for most of the movie. The first 20 minutes is just exposition and then it jumps 6 months and basically resets the entire movie and adds more exposition. The action is ok and most of the scenes with venom are stupid but fun. They spent a lot of time on a villain who isn't interesting or fun to watch at all. The end battle is a really uninteresting CGI fight with barely any fun things.,Venom

Topher Grace got absolutely helled for his much better version of Venom in Spider-Man 3 but, people have convinced themselves this one is good. Its not. Not even in an ironic way.

987,DreadfulA,Missed opportunity,5,15 February 2019,"As an independent superhero movie this would have been pretty good, but since it is Venom, one of my favourite supervillains from childhood, the stupid plot choices ruined it for me. Connections to Marvel universe, especially Spiderman, is unavoidable. The only reason I can come up with why Spiderman was not part of this story must be the lack of rights, since this movie is released by Columbia, not Sony or Marvel. This means that for me Venom was a pointless movie, even though it was techincally pretty sound and it was nice to see Venom in action on big screen.Tom Hardy was good, although his face is arguably too mainstay these days. But even his witty performance doesn't help when Eddie Brock's and Venom's true motivation, which give these characters a purpose, were completely ignored and replaced with a nonsense genetic match/mismatch plot and a battle with 1000 other symbiots, which made Venom seem weak and nothing special... I mean, huh? OK, Eddie Brock lost everything, but originally that was because of Peter Parker to whom Venom also belong originally and who then abandoned the symbiot, which gave them both a motive to destroy Peter Parker/Spiderman, and that is also why Venom looks like an evil Spiderman in black (at least Spider-Man 3 managed to pull that off correctly up to that point).Only redeeming quality of this movie was to see a climpse of Cletus Kasady and hope that Carnage-movie will be a better effort. When done right the action and plot could be insane, just like the character, but it requires a higher PG rating.",Venom
988,JohnnySlayer,That's what you get for trying to join the MCU.,3,3 October 2018,"When Sony announced that this film would ignore the R rating to see if this can join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I knew it was going to be trash. Almost 40 minutes were cut out and those scenes were Hardy's favorite moments shooting this film. Hardy was the best part and honestly the only good thing about the film. Everything else was a mess. I appreciate that Sony tried to be as comic accurate to the character as possible, but it wasn't enough. The tone was everywhere. I can't even begin to tell how bad on what they were trying to do, because I don't even know. Side characters do their part and that's that. I don't understand why the even want to try go with a PG-13 rating. Venom doesn't need the MCU and the MCU doesn't need venom. If the movie would have stayed with the R rating. It would have been a better movie for sure.",Venom

Effect: Bad jokes, bad script, dated CGI (kids care little about the quality?)",4,23 December 2018,This movie is a typical example of bad production decisions: movie for adults dumb down to fit into PG-13 standards. Why: just to make sure enough kids will be allowed into the cinemas. So instead of getting a lot of good dark humor we got a lot of stupid dialogues. Instead of seeing few great CGI we see a lot of bad rendering. They even cut out some scenes from the trailer... that's suck. Like this whole movie.Marvel is known for making rather fun to watch movies. Nothing too sophisticated nor too dumb. Association with Marvel here ends with the main character.

They either watched a different movie or are being paid which just makes a farce of IMDB rating system.
Currently this movie is sitting at 7/10 which is a joke. Shouldn't be higher than 5 overall.The plot is rubbish.
Why the spacecraft crashes in asia for one Symbiote to escape only for it to immediately travel straight back to San Francisco, into the very building to the guy that's looking for it.
What was the point in that at all??
Why have it escape? It did nothing for the story.Eddie asks millionaire bag guy tough questions that he sneaked from his fiancee's laptop and it costs him his job and hers and she immediately leaves him.
No messing around with her eh.
Within 5 mins they show us that they are this happy couple, photos everywhere, even her screensaver was a couple photo but he cost her job so his ass is gone.
Harsh?
6 months pass and she's hooked up with a doctor, who's moved in. She does NOT mess around haha.
Then she can't wait to help poor eddie who's acting crazy even though most people would distance themselves from someone they so easily discarded.
Also they have zero chemistry and Michelle Williams running around with a highschool skirt on was wierd (isn't she nearly 40?)Anyway Venom is a movie like suicide squad that they sat in a room and thought it up but instantly bottled it.
This should have been like Deadpool and went down the R-Rated road but sadly it went down the cgi buddy road instead.
If you're going to make a stand alone movie of the evil/bad guys from super hero franchises then they HAVE to be dark otherwise it's cringe worthy.Venom's motives for suddenly deciding to help eddie is laughable, the cgi fight at the end is boring also venom's voice sucks.Watch the movie Upgrade and then watch this and you'll see how it should have been done.",Venom
993,malcolmwrites,Not perfect but better than you think,7,7 October 2018,"Okay, Venom isn't a perfect film. There are a few plot holes (Why doesn't Dr. Skirth just gather the photos and info. herself? How does Anne know how to work complicated space shuttle equipment? etc.), but, overall, this is a better movie than you might think. Sure, it should have been rated R in the vein of Logan and the two Deadpool movies. But I can forgive the studio for doing the calculus: They erred on the side of keeping the sensibilities at the PG-13 level to avoid major disruption with future films in the Spider-Man universe. And yes, parts of the film have clearly been sanitized and watered down for a more general audience. But the characters are interesting and well-developed. The relationships are real. Tom Hardy provides a performance brimming with nuance and complexity when anyone else might have played the role as a cartoon or cliché. (Side note: Hardy IS this film. In terms of acting chops, no one else on screen comes close.)And Venom? Not bad! I was expecting the typical malicious alien-host fusion of the Sigourney Weaver experience, but this alien has personality. Not only that, the alien-host combo isn't just a human-meets-alien parasite horror chestnut. No. There is a real relationship here. Brock and Venom represent a Marvel bromance at its weirdest and most original. Venom is to Marvel villains what Freddy Kruger was to slasher flicks: Humor, character, and a 3-D personality instead of a cookie-cutter silent stalker.The movie is not as satisfyingly nostalgic as Tobey Maguire's Spider Man (we all waited a looooong time for a Spidey that good!), as clever as Deadpool, or as graphically violent as Logan. But it's a gritty movie with real characters who live real lives and have real problems in a realistic world of love, envy, psychological trauma, and occupational hardships. Even the San Francisco setting was a refreshing breather from the traditional NYC hero milieu. I do recommend seeing this film. It adds something new, not just to the Marvel universe, but to the way characters and relationships can be effectively constructed to create real people out of comic book creations. So film lovers and superhero fans alike should go see it. Don't expect ""brilliant."" But be prepared to be surprised by ""pretty darn good.""",Venom

But it's a fun movie that you can enjoy if you just let it happen and not think about it too much. I recommend watching it just for Venom and Eddie's banter. That portion of the movie is great along with when venom goes full on symbiote beast. My biggest complaint is the movie is very boring for the first half hour. The story is generic along with the characters. But to be honest I don't care it's fun,Venom

So... I just finished watching this and... I won't say it's the worst I've ever seen but it's up there. Even Tom Hardy can't make this look good.There's a lot of things wrong with this movie so here's a short list..
1.CGI is like on a cheap editing app

1002,nleon-96835,Great acting,8,10 October 2018,I enjoyed the movie. Great acting! But I was disappointed in the second end scene credit.,Venom
1003,davedflores,Happy Medium,8,9 October 2018,"While critics reviewed the film very poorly and audiences seemed to love the film, this year's Venom for me was somewhere in between. 
The film is the story of Eddie Brock, who was fired from his job after diving a little too deep into a story about the Life Foundation, an organization run by Carlton Drake, self-made millionaire with the intentions to change the world. When a scientist comes to Eddie with a problem, he investigates it further, where things go south. He becomes Venom and has to fight Riot, another one of the symbiotes found in outer space.
The story did not make me feel like I was watching one of the Marvel movies in regards to the fact that it did not follow the origin story at all, even changing the location that Eddie Brock lived. 
The film made me think about the possibility of adding Venom to the MCU, with Venom being in San Fransisco and not New York, how will he fight his most famous foe.
Written by Jeff Pinkner, Scott Rosenburg and Kelly Marcel then film does a good job showing the evolution of Eddie Brock's and Venom's relationship. The two grow to like and depend on each other and it shows pretty well. At the same time, one of the weakest points of the film for me was the dialogue. It seemed corny and very drier than it should have been.
With Ruben Fleischer in the director's chair, the film did well, from keeping the shot selection different, utilizing Tom Hardy's array of skills and making sure that Venom looked amazing and accurate to the comic book.
Alan Baumgarter did a good job as the editor, wrapping up the film together nicely, with my favorite juxtaposition of scenes being when Venom had escaped the police by jumping in the ocean and swimming away, when he came out of the water he returned to his form as Eddie Brock, with a smooth transition in the air.
Lastly, with Matthew Libatuqie controlling the lighting as the cinematographer, he was able to make the scene darker to show the obviously darker nature of Venom. While it worked through most of the film, certain parts were a bit too dark, making certain characters hard to distinguish from one another.
While the Venom film was good, it could have been great. With the opportunity it had to make the film Rated-R, it would have given them more chance to work with a darker dialogue and more violence. It would have felt more like a Venom movie to me.",Venom
1004,paulblawrence,It could have been so good! :(,6,21 December 2018,"It is abundantly clear that the makers of Venom blinked first in the game of chicken. This could have been a much better film, but they hesitated to appeal to children, and definitely any social justice warrior. Smh.Tom Hardy, though wilder than normal in most scenes, was definitely the perfect choice to play Eddie Brock. He's the only decent actor in this movie, and him actually becoming Venom took way too long!The action scenes are good, but very confusing, and too few. The violence is toned down to the point that its annoying. I understand that Sony wants to make money, but you're Sony. Not Disney. Theres practically no blood at all in this film. Hard to swallow (no pun intended) for a film about an alien who bites off several heads in this movie.The villain so poorly acted that its eye-rolling to look at him and think he'd be a foil for Tom Hardy! His politics (liberal) are all over the screen and his motivation for bringing more symbiotes to earth is stupid.San Francisco hasn't looked this good in decades! In fact, this hell hole of a town is filmed so carefully so that audiences may think its actually a nice place to visit. Its not. Of all places, they filmed there??Overall, Venom himself is great to look at. His powers are cool, and his character is likeable, but its not the Venom everyone was waiting to see. Hes toned too far down, as is the violence, and the action, and that's what hurt this movie the most.",Venom

At best, they're unintentionally funny and provide employment for CGI nerds.

Spider-Man 3's Venom did not stay true to the comic book character, Topher Grace did a terrible job on portraying Eddie Brock, his acting was very poor and didn't even looked like Eddie Brock at all. And Venom was not venom in that movie. He didn't look like venom, he doesn't even sound like venom. So going into this film I was expecting for this film to make up for spider-man 3's venom, and it does make up for that. DO NOT believe the critics, because they don't know what they watch. The chemistry between Tom Hardy and Venom is amazing in this film, both have funny parts in this movie. People have a problem with the cgi in this film, personally, I liked the cgi, I loved how venom looked in this movie. And that's another thing I wanted to say about this movie is that venom is actually venom in this movie. He looked like venom, he sounded like venom, and he acted like he is venom from the comics. I thought the action in this movie was great, the same thing goes for the soundtrack of this movie. My biggest problem with this movie is the villain, he's probably one of the worst villains I've seen in Cinema history, his acting was very poor, he wasn't menacing at all, and he didn't even feel like a villain, he just felt like a generic character.
Conclusion: Venom stayed true to the comic book character, because Venom was Venom in this movie. Every time venom showed up I was having an amazing time, sure it has it's flaws, but it's still a fun time.",Venom

1012,dalehoustman,A REASON TO UNINVENT FILM...,2,24 December 2018,"Simply one of the worst - uh - ""films"" I've ever seen. I had my doubts that they could make a decent film out of this particular character, but I didn't think it could be quite this horrible. The tone is all over the place, with attempted jokes in the face of head-eating and mass murder, none of which appears to leave any impression on the characters, who act as if everything is a minor inconvenience to be shrugged off with a smile and a bit of shoddy wit. The ""motives"" of the characters (including Venom) are so vague they might as well be considered a form of arcane mysticism. Tom Hardy is an intelligent performer: I am sure he knows that this was strictly ""get paid and get out"" territory. The ethical landscape of the film is a disaster site, with a cool hipness being displayed between scenes of rampaging violence on a mass scale, and no lasting emotional scars on any of the participants. No consequences but for one death, and a lot of innocents slaughtered to no apparent end. The art direction is poor also, with everything in a splash of light blue. Difficult to watch and really emblematic of the general degradation of American cinema since the 70s. A vacuous exercise in mindless action and lack of human psychology. Wretched.",Venom

1026,briangeorgi,Much better than the reviews!,7,8 October 2018,"This movie was well-acted, well-directed, and thoroughly entertaining. Don't get thrown by the (unfair) bad critical reviews. It is different: It's scarier than most comic book movies and the internal banter between Eddie (Tom Hardy) and his ""alter ego"" takes a bit of getting used to. I was in a crowded theater, though, and everyone enjoyed themselves. I'm glad I saw it on the big screen and I'm looking forward to the sequel!",Venom

1028,pointbreakk,So glad I picked this to watch!,10,7 October 2018,"The entire Venom story is my favorite comic experience as a youngster and since this version wouldn't follow faithfully, I anticipated at least some measure of disappointment.
Lots of action. Lots and lots of action, but not so much that the characters and story were compromised. We have Eddie Brock, who is a genuinely good guy by nature. He butters his bread as a reporter who tells the truth and exposes corruption on many levels. This obviously, can be a dangerous thing. When the situation becomes one where telling the truth is a conflict of interest to his own livelihood.. he chooses truth and is broken by the fall out.
I recognized early on that Brock was not TOO smart, TOO strong, or TOO talented at .. well .. anything. He is a regular person like us. Just doing the best he can.This is where it becomes interesting: Venom is so much like Brock. He shares the same lack of control over his impulses. He considers himself a ""loser"". He encourages Brock to pursue his ex 'fiancee (Williams) so you see Venom as a sort of hopeless romantic as well. He can lack confidence ( ""zero percent chance"" to defeat Riot) Symbiosis becomes quite a positive thing - you're not left feeling that Eddie Brock has been possessed or hijacked.Sign me up to see the sequel now! The perfect actor for the villain part has been cast.",Venom

Seems to be a good introduction to the next films, and Tom Hardy was a great actor in the film.",Venom
1033,robertdelpopolo,Horror Comedy Action. Pick one. STICK TO IT.,4,13 January 2019,"There seems to be quite a bit of agreement on what Im about to say about the film. Venom doesnt quite know what it is. It cant decide wether its a goofy, action or a horror movie. Therefore its all of it and none at the same time.The goofy jokes are pretty lame, which is why they are funny, you dont laugh with the writers, you laugh at them.The action scenes are meh at best,
car chase : check
motorcycle : check
ridiculous (bad) cgi fight: check
sure, watching Tom Hardy motorcross in San Francisco is quite fun, but its not really action.Finally, the horror; there are glimpses, glimmers of hope scattered around this movie. Little snippets of what could have been, but as soon as they appear they disappear.Two scenes really stood out to me due to their potential. After quite a lot of buildup of Venom getting into the building (BY RUNNING UP IT), Eddie decides to take the lift down. Instead of having Eddie walk into the SWAT team, they should have been swarming the building crawling through the floors looking for him. Then, they could have had an ALIEN like hunting scene where Venom slowly takes out the task force one by one, in true horror movie fashion.The other obvious horror scene could have been using the creepy little girl that delivers RIOT to the Musk wannabe, they could have homaged The Shining, they could have pulled an exorcist, they could have done a million things, but the little girl just has white pupils and a deep voice.Throughout the movie there are just continuous disappointments because you see what it is missing.Instead of the cheap love story and all the stupid overdone things they should have been ballsy with their movie. Yes the movie DID make 800+ million, however im sure it was going to do that anyway. Venom is probably one of the most badass characters in comic history, and Tom Hardy is Tom Hardy.I would have loved to see something along these lines:Symbiote hunts Eddie.
Symbiote captures Eddie and they become Venom.
Venom starts unleashing hell because he can, hunts SWAT etc.
Venom goes after Musk wannabe and Kills him.Throw some more horror elements in there, and it would have made for a much more satisfactory watch. I have always adored Venom, and this movie had so much potential, but it was all for nothing. No rewatchability. Nothing worth remembering. Just a flick.It was funny seeing Tom Hardy being a bit of a pussball, but even he cant help a crap script and an even worse film.",Venom

1036,Akaanksh,One-time Watch,6,10 October 2018,"Even when it had good comedy and action sequences and great acting from the cast, 'Venom' falls into the endless pit of mediocre films thanks to its poorly paced script and cliched story. Even the short runtime was responsible for the failure as it denied the characters from any sort of proper development.
Though the movie took the wrong route in a lot of areas it did do Venom right. The symbiote from outer-space who has been a well-known nemesis of 'Spider-Man' was interpreted as a straight out evil character with zero emotions in Sam Raimi's third Spider-Man film and was portrayed the same way in many of the animated adaptations of the character. But 'Venom' took a different route as opposed to its predecessors and that was being honest to the comics. Venom was not as funny as he was in this movie but it did manage to show the inner struggle of Venom and its host - Eddie Brock which instantly makes both of them likable. 
The major mistake and disappointment was Riot, the villain of the story who suffered from the same problem every other character suffered from - insufficient screen time. He was portrayed as another generic villain with a lame, 'Conquering the world' evil motivation. Even the 'Life Foundation' and it's head Carlton Drake who was constantly mentioned to have a strong and powerful influence was only mentioned to have it and was never really shown properly when it had the chance to.
The only other thing left to say is to wait for the mid-credit scene as it sets up a potential sequel.",Venom
1037,MOVIE-REVIEW-POOPSHOOTs,"...Like a turd, in the wind...",7,15 March 2020,"Much better than I expected. Hardy is phenomenal, per usual, and his surrounding cast is very solid as well. The action sequences are fantastic, including that throwback scene to Bullit. *Fun fact - this film was released on the 50th anniversary of Bullit's release in 1968.*So with a great cast and filming crew, the script, plot and directoring had to follow suit. For the most part, I thought they did. Of the three, I found the script to be the strongest. This movie has multiple, great and original one-liners. And overall, the dialogue was entertaining as well, and often comical. The directing and plot were about even and although they weren't the strongest aspects of the film, they certainly did not expose any weak points (plot holes, scenes that drag, pacing, etc.).8/10 - Very funny and entertaining. Stan Lee's cameo is one of the best in all of his movies - you will never see it coming. Will definitely watch again.",Venom

1044,thesupershadow,Wonderful and weird anti-hero film,8,6 October 2021,"VENOM - my review: Overall, I think it's one of the best anti-hero films to be released, this even despite being a separate version from the 'cannon' spider-man series/character. It follows a not too confusing and linear pace, but at the same time doesn't feel too rushed and allows for some really intimate and engaging acting unlike - Avengers: infinity war...Let me assure you, the curse of spider-man 3 has been broken! Venom can work as a violent yet funny character similar to deadpool, the CGI is incredible, the humour and script is well-written, there's even hints of Alien-film soundtrack and the famous French horn sound used as the theme for Venom in Spider-man 3 makes a return.This film could've turned out much, much worse. Don't trust those bad reviews based on other repetitive Marvel films, look at the winning financial viewing results, or better yet watch it yourself and decide. Tom Hardy has done this role JUSTICE!",Venom

My entire group of 8 people thoroughly loved the movie, some even spouting that it was the best movie they'd seen in a few years. Now, here's the warning: you know how Marvel movies always have a clip after the credits?? Do NOT stay to watch the clip after credits. It is an ADVERTISEMENT for that terrible cartoon Spiderman that you'll likely see in the trailers. My group sat through 10+ minutes of credits to see what was after them, and we were lividly disappointed. It has nothing to do with Venom and it left us all genuinely angry. Please don't sit through the whole long list of credits only to disappoint yourselves. We all left the theater angry and ranting about it.",Venom

1047,csbob447,A beautiful trash baby!,3,9 October 2018,"So this movie was kind of crap, but also kind of amazing too! It's a mess but I had a lot of fun laughing at it's expense. It was basically everything that I hoped for...well okay an R-rating is what I hoped for but ehhhh...Tom Hardy has a really bad New Yorker accent that's like a cartoon, but looking past that he did a good job here. He really gets his character and does add a lot to the movie. And the relationship between Venom and Eddie is pretty great. It's not quite a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" situation, but the whole interactions between the two characters were pretty great. And the stuff with Venom that we do get is also pretty cool too. I like the buildup to when we see full Venom in action, and he does remind me a lot of the comics. So that is the one real genuine praise I can give outside of some odds and ends like the motorcycle chase being pretty fun to watch and Michelle Williams is also good here too despite her weak character, but more on that later. Unfortunately for some, but fortunately for me, the movie is broken!The action scenes are pretty bland. While I did like the motorcycle chase scene, outside of the Symbiote power there really isn't much new when it comes with the framing and stunt choreography that I haven't seen before, and honestly better. The motorcycle chase is the only good action scene, because every other action set piece is poorly shot, jumbly edited, and depending on the setting also hard to follow sometimes when it's in darker settings. Which is especially true with the fight sequence with Venom and Riot. Both characters do look rather similar and seeing them duke it out with the mess of editing it makes it hard to figure out who was fighting who. But it does have a roundabout way of being funny to watch when you see these reoccurring elements done before in other action films.Riz Ahmed makes for an underwhelming bad guy. Sure he is a generic bad guy, but if you ham it up it can be fun to watch. However Ahmed plays him very reserved and not very expressive, always having a very blank expression. Which I guess is kind of the point given the character is supposed to be cold, but I just never bought him. The character is a more evil version of Mark Zuckerberg, but he comes off more like Gabe from the Office! Although Ahmed got nothing on Jenny Slate! She is flat out terrible in this, underacting and looking so bored on screen! She always has a super bland and blank expression! Like there's a scene where she gets caught whistleblowing the company she works for, and her expression when she is caught comes off like she left the lights on in her apartment when she left. Like...why?There was some bad publicity leading up where Tom Hardy blatantly said that 40 minutes of the film was cut, I don't know if it was the more gorier parts of the film that was promised to us, but I think there was a lot of development cut out, because judging on the theatrical cut this script is underdeveloped! I gave Michelle Williams credit for being pretty good in the movie, and she is, but the relationship between Eddie and her character is extremely underdeveloped, especially when there are like some kind of romantic tension with her and her new man, who is absolutely pointless in this regard. I honestly did not care about Tom Hardy and Michelle William's relationship at all. The relationship with Eddie and Venom also felt underwhelming too. Like the general tension between the two is fine, but Venom turns from a ""I wanna wreck things in this world"" to ""actually this planet is pretty cool I'm gonna save it"" in the blink of an eye! Like...where was the development? The movie flies by so fast too! It's barely 2 hours long but it feels a lot more like an hour and a half film. Which does run into a problem with the short development and story arks and especially the third act which flies by very quickly. The tone is also a mess. It's not a straight up horror film, but it does have a ton of psychological elements to it mixed with a campy Marvel movie, it's jarring but it's also hilarious having these two different tones at odds with each other. Like the third act has a song cue right out of an Avengers film and it is so out of place, it's amazing!If there is one thing I can credit about the script, it's the dialogue. There are some intentionally funny scenes and quips, but for the most part it's poorly written and pretty cheesy and edgy. It was hilarious, and probably unintentional too which makes it better!Overall the movie is garbage but go in with the right mindset it is a fun movie to rip apart with friends. The jarring tones, underwritten screenplay, and corny edge makes this a hilarious romp! Although I will say that it is also a bit disappointing if Sony kept it as an R-rated movie, developed more on the relationship with Eddie and Venom, and had someone who wasn't a studio hack like Ruben Fleischer and had the tone feel like an Evil Dead movie, then it would be a fun watch AND a legit good movie instead of making a safe movie for a doomed and terrible Spider-Man-less cinematic universe. But I am satisfied with the trash baby that it is!Also the movie has practically the same story beats as Catwoman and that got me SHOOK!",Venom

The animation was totally awesome. Drake was definitely no Trevor. They could have worked more on that. I would have had another actor in Drake's place, it just didn't fit the comic.Story is good if you take out the absolutely wimp romance going on here. I would have given this a 10 if it wasn't for the embarrassment of a man romance here. Only manly part was where he he took advantage to get info off her and got her fired. Which was him being a real man, doing something that the chick can't see it and thought was bad, but it was actually for her own good. Chick two-timing him and Brock being such a loser saying he misses her, wants her back. This really took a lot away from Brock and Venom.The competition between Peter Parker also could have been nice. That friendly competition between bros adds a bit. I always never understood how Spiderman could beat Venom, it's just not possible.But I like how this movie is about the comradery between Venom and Brock.

I came out of the movie theatre sated. All movie suits different tastes. And I was in the mood for a horror/sci-fi/action just before halloween. It was a hero/ villian origin story perfect for the avengers haitus. I was never bored- in fact I didn't want to go to the toilet. Plus it has Tom Hardy, whose magnitism can carry every scene (Kudos on the bike riding skills). Yes, Im a fan girl, for his acting and it was on point( To go from swag to vulnerable to manic is a delight to see. The CGI wasn't bad, so it wasn't distracting. Venom himself was menacing, I kind of wish they had made him even more menacing, but I suppose they had to fit the '15' rating (I'm from the UK), the comic aspects came from the dynamic between Eddie ad Venom, which at times went from intense to whimsical (funny but it took away some of the edge- unless your into that kind of thing). I suppose that is my only critism. His love interest (and her boyfriend) was actually quite helpful, her involvement was crucial in the final act (shame about her wig). At the end of the day, great popcorn munching movie, it's best to go in with medium expectations so you can be mildly surprised it's a decent piece of entertainment. Would recommend.",Venom
1054,zerone23,Venom is an unexpected good anti-hero movie,7,3 October 2018,"I had brought small expectation to watch this movie because Sony did not use an origin story. Did Venom story work without his first known host a.k,a Spider-Man? The answer is yes.Tom Hardy nailed his role as Eddie Brock except he is not a blonde like in the comic. Also, Tom is voicing Venom in the movie. So, he is playing two roles simultaneously. The funny thing is when Venom speaking, I feel like I'm listening Bane (Dark Knight Trilogy) with a vibrant effect. Nonetheless, it is awesome. No doubt that Tom Hardy is great at his jobSpeaking of the plot, first act is a little bit slow. But in the rest of the act, they keep up the pace. Rushed? Not too much. Even they didn't give Riot more time for background telling, they had great job in Venom's background. Furthermore, I found a single plot hole in the last act. Well, it's a plot hole for casual viewer. But if you are a die-hard Venom fans or geeky enough, it's not a plot hole. Another thing to add about the good thing about this movie is its effect. The blue fire used in the movie was beautiful. Not forget to mention, the last fighting scene. Also, the movie works like Wolverine with its PG-13. But, I know it should have better with R-rated. Yes, Logan is the proof.Will this movie has sequel? Even thought I want Venom join the MCU, but i'm pretty sure the movie will have sequel. Its IW revenue should be enourmous considering the fact that Tencent is a part of the production team. Yup, that Tencent.As a casual comicbook reader, it is nice to see Life Foundation and Five Symbiotes (Scream, Riot, Toxin, Venom, and Carnage) come to the big screen. Also, the chemistry between Eddie and Venom is something that make this movie worth to watch. There are two credit scenes. Mid and post-end credits. Both credits teasing new movie project of Sony. But, I'm going to talk about the mid credit only because it teases Venom's sequel. As rumored, Woody Harrelson plays as Carnage. In the credit, we know for sure that Carnage is going to be the villain in the sequel. From his little appearance, I'm grateful that Woody is nailed as Cletus Kasady. I hope the sequel will not be cancelled so we can see how good Woody as Carnage.Ciao",Venom

Eddie's chemistry with Venom is very entertaining. The action is underwhelming but can be fun. The villain lacks clear motives and doesn't have any personality other then being evil. Also since the film had to be PG-13 the film has many scenes cut out of it and feels like a jumbled mess. But the film is still fun it just has many problems and also has a very confusing timeline.

1063,fanofmoststuff,It was ok...,4,15 October 2018,"This movie wasn't AWFUL. But I wouldn't say it's Marvel's best. 
I'm not very educated in the history of the character's and whatnot. So this is all coming from my knowledge from the movies and such. 
I will start with the positives, because that's fun! 
I thought that the fight scenes were well choreographed, for the most part. I thought that Tom Hardy as Eddie could have been better performed, he could have been great if it weren't for some of his stylistic choices (or it might have been the director, I don't know!)
And here' s where I start the negatives...
I didn't think it was very ""entertaining"" how Tom portrayed Eddie. He was very casual and upbeat but it a way that was way too cheesy and would be seen as bad acting. Sometimes that's ok, but only if it's in the right context and environment (that's when it can turn into good comedy, which this clearly was not!). Eddie's strange character was put into situations were the people around him didn't react or play off his attitudes, that made it so that I would feel uncomfortable watching it instead of the characters around him feeling uncomfortable, which something that can be easily achieved if you write good character interactions! 
I did not feel a single thing for any of the characters because there wasn't enough content or information that showed how each of these people are with each other. One scene (or multiple even) with cheesy and awful dialogue won't cut it so I can feel something for them. The simple rule of ""Show, Don't Tell"" clearly lacks in a lot of scenes. I can't believe that two characters love each other just because they say it, you need to put in some steaks to a simple feeling or emotions so the audience can see!
But you know, opinions are subjective. If you enjoyed this, good for you. But I do think it is unfair to label this movie anything higher than an 8 and anything lower than a 5. 
Sometimes opinions stop us from really seeing that true quality of a movie. 
I did not enjoy Venom. I will not be seeing it again.
But I will give credit where credit is due.

Which is a shame as Venom and Eddie have a interesting dynamic in the comics, but in here we have Venom used more for comedy relief in the film than anything else, skipping over most of the character development.The story itself has no pacing issues but its just so dull and a ton of scenes just feel so pointless to the story leaving it feeling like filler.What was a big disappointment however were the action scenes, the venom tentacles that you see in the trailer just look very cheesy and weird. Venom only has a couple of fight scenes which are just OK which is a shame when you have a power house like venom in your film, plus they take place at night which makes it very hard to see as Venom is basically fully black.Tom Hardy was good.",Venom

I have nothing against A Star is Born, but if that is indeed the case, then that would be the dumbest idea. Just in case for those who are excited for A Star is Born, word of advise, please try not compare it to Venom and just chill because they're both NOT a like. I mean, if ""Captain Marvel"" and ""Shazam"" were released on the same day in 2019, then there could be a HUGE disaster and where the hell would we be? Reviewing an action movie JUST to support a love movie is REALLY pointless and not the same thing as reviewing a DC movie JUST to support a Marvel movie. So about Venom, yes, the look of Venom is exactly like from what I saw in the images from comic books and he looks definitely a lot better than how he looks in Spider-Man 3. It's NOT even boring like Batman & Robin where you have an action scene for about 10 or 15 minutes and then we have long boring scenes, NO, all I see is action. I realized that the pacing is almost fast, but not as fast as the pacing in The Dark Tower, it was just...there. I also found two silliest moments that will be my favorites which I will not tell you which because I don't want this review to contain SPOILERS!!!Also, they tried. They tried to have Venom be part of the MCU, and I know that the creators of Venom wanted to have Venom in the MCU and I don't know why Feige wouldn't do that, I mean he's supposed to be the archenemy of Spider-Man, why couldn't the producer of the MCU work with the producers of Venom like how he handled with the producers for Spider-Man: Homecoming? It makes no sense.With that out of the way, I don't think it's that close of being bad. I still think it's both entertaining and silly at the same time. I can't tell you WHY because this is spoiler-free, if you go watch it yourself, then you'll understand.",Venom

Each of the human characters were well formed and pretty effortless. I think the whole thing falls down on the timing of the dialogue between Hardy and Venom. The voice work/dubbing for Venom is really laboured. It is just off and this really hurt the whole pace and flow of the movie. I think it is largely an editing problem, because the lines for Venom are kooky, menacing and over the top which is great. They just fall flat In the delivery. There was something really lethargic/sluggish about the integration of the CGI elements because all the scenes without Venom are seemless and comfortable and the Venom scenes are just sort of lame. Regardless of the timing issues which let our monster down, the kookiness overall was fun and Tom Michelle and Riz were great to watch.

The conversation between Eddie and Venom work perfectly and stay true to the comic books.Stunning action scenes, the part with the S.W.A.T team is awesome, the bike chase is very cool and well filmed.

Almost everything about this movie is garbage. The plot doesn't make sense, the character motivations don't make sense, there are major continuity issues that don't make sense, and the action, direction, and cinematography are pretty much all amateurish at best.This is not a good movie.

1097,neilbowers73,Ignore everything the critics have said it's no Turd in the Wind.,8,3 October 2018,Just got back from seeing Venom and have to say totally and utterly ignore what all the critics have said about the film because it's the total opposite. Venom deserves its place in the MCU.Tom Hardy is great as Eddie Brock/Venom and his character gets all the best lines and laughs. Riz Ahmed is believable as Carlton Drake the founder of Life the company set up to look off the planet for any signs of life. His alter ego Riot later on in the film is also pretty cool too.All the other characters play their parts well and the chase scene through San Francisco is pretty spectacular as well. My only criticism is it should have been an 18. That way it could have been gory like the comics. It seems wrong that Sony insisted on removing the gore and violence to make it a 15 and possibly move into the Spideman universe. Ignore the critics as well about Woody Harlesons character. Although limited to 5 minutes it sets up a sequel nicely.Go and buy a ticket and enjoy it for what it is.,Venom

It was like watching an homage to these two great franchises, with a healthy dose of King Kong, wrapped up in a badass Venom costume, way cooler than the one Topher wore in Spiderman 3. Also, I ABSOLUTELY loved the hilarious banter between Eddie and the symbiote, and the fact that they both were losers in their own worlds, and it is that bond that convinces the symbiote to not destroy Earth. It was not a typical Disney Marvel film, and thank goodness for that. It is more of a monster/horror flick and a hell of a lot of fun!",Venom

''Venom'' is ten times worst than ''The amazing Spider-Man 2''.I've watch this movie and I can tell Sony only thinks about joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe Disney even thought it will never happen It doesn't care about the characters or even the whole story It was supposed to be with The Amazing Spider-Man series but it was cancelled so Sony made a Venom spin-off without Spider-Man.

1107,jadgrace-18162,"Long... No, not screen time",5,6 April 2021,"There's a difference between well-paced and slow. First, let us consider :45 minutes, a good amount of the run time, is spent on plot and character development. Considering both could have been established in half the time, to say the first :45 minutes are slow and grinding is an understatement. Another ""longish"" element is a car/motorcycle chase that probably would have allowed me to have a lobster brunch and still not miss much.When the union of Venom and Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock (who absolutely saves this movie with his, um, ""killer"" performance) finally does take place, the digital effects are disappointing. Not what one would expect from Marvel Entertainment. One might even say some of the planning of the effects was a bit lazy. A scene where Eddie is sliding down the side of a building with relative ease doesn't make any sense when a shot a few moments later in the same sequence shows the the side of the building is a series of recessed windows - hardly a smooth surface. There are a few errors such as this.Again, Tom Hardy's performance was the main reason if I finished viewing ""Venom"". The rest of the cast was suitable, though Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed both seemed less than committed to their roles. This could have been a much higher quality film.",Venom
1108,bardavidi,A great comics buddy film,7,6 October 2018,"The trailer doesn't set the right tone or expectations for viewers who might think this is a more serious, dark telling of Venom's origin story and first encounter of Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy). What you actually watch is a buddy film between a sentient symbiotic alien learning to live in the same body as an investigating reporter's whose intentions are morally sound yet his hothead execution is determinal to his sucess in life. Hardy is as always a master of bringing a likeable manic persona to his Eddie Brock as well as artfully creating a physical distinction between Eddie and Venom to best showcase their dynamic and establish their bond for the future of the franchise. 
This is the film's only driving force and it allows for a lighthearted yet complex exploration of Venom as an anti-hero. However, it does so at the expense of its MANY supporting roles, such as Eddie's mind-of-her-own lawyer fiance, Anne (Michelle Williams) and his opposing force/main villan played by Riz Ahmed for the actual 90ish minutes screen time it gets. It also does a very poor job of carving out a good role for Jenny Slate as the scientist and mostly Ahmed's personal assistant, Dr. Skirth, who could've pulled either tone off and has way too much screen time not to. What a truely bizzare choice to cut story in favor of a preview to a movie that's not even set in the same universe. Hopefully, we'll get to see Williams' Anne in a meatier, more challenging storyline as a female supporting/minor role.",Venom

Tom Hardy was fantastic, Riz Ahmed and Michelle Williams was good, The source material was handled pretty well, the CGI was pretty well detailed and well used, I liked how both Venom and Riot looked, moved, and fought, The story made sense and didn't need Spider-Man, The MCU, or an R rating to be good. an R rating doesn't automatically equal a good movie, There's a good amount of violence in the movie, I heard a few people gasp at a certain action Venom did after his first transformation.People seemed to Joke about the fact Venom choosing to stay on Earth for reasons such as being a loser, and looking at the San Francisco skyline. which isn't true. On his planet, he was an outcast, and on Earth, he felt special and powerful, which he didn't feel on his planet.overall, Venom is not a bad film at all. It told a story that made sense, it gave us a fantastic representation of both Eddie Brock and Venom, and it gives us a good look at the future of these characters.Rating 8.4/10",Venom
1111,steveb69,"Great film, worth a watch",7,20 December 2018,"To start, I really enjoyed this film.
Oh & spoilers ahead...I didn't bother to see Venom at the cinema, my initial thoughts being, it's a standalone Venom movie, it's not linked to the Marvelverse, there's no Spidey tie in, it's made by Fox. What's the point?But the film was surprisingly good when I got around to watching it at home.With Tom Hardy playing a likeable Eddie Brock, I guess not having that rivalry with Peter Parker from the comic book world allowed the character of Brock to come through as a more sympathetic loser than the total git he was in comic books. The supporting cast all did their jobs fine & the film moved along at a fine pace.Some of the CGI, well actually a lot of the CGI, was too much CGI. But then I have no idea how you show Venom fight sequances without CGI.It's a shame the film centered on a battle with another symbiote, I don't know why films need to create a hero & then immediatly create a 2nd version but bad so quickly.
It would have been equally entertaining to have spent more time with Venom / Brock on lighter, humerous, charachter building moments. Ala Superman 1978.The end spoiler of Carnage is a nice touch & I look forward to the next film & from a fanboy point of view, maybe they can bring it a tad more into the Marveverse!!",Venom

1119,kiwijinxter,Nobody channels Eddie Brock / Venom like Tom Hardy. Nobody!,10,13 October 2018,"As someone who had hundreds of Spider-Man comics when I was younger (I even owned a copy of Amazing Spider-Man #300 featuring the first full appearance of Venom), this is the PERFECT Venom origin story. And when I see Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, Venom's alter ego, it makes me feel happy, contented and as fuzzy as the symbiote. In the comics, Eddie Brock is a character that is a bit of an outcast, is unsure of himself and gets even more confused (initially) when Venom entered his life, and Tom Hardy channels Eddie Brock to perfection!!! Venom in the comics had some dark-ish humour, and the humour that Venom spouts in the movie is spot on - in fact Venom gets the best one liners. And the biggest laughs from the audience. The movie portrays a beautiful symbiotic relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom, and shows progression in their relationship throughout the movie. The CGI for Venom is also spot on, making him a highly flexible and versatile character with the symbiotic extensions doing some cool stunts. It makes Venom look cool and dangerous at the same time. The pacing is just right, and Tom Hardy's versatility as an actor really stole the show, so much so that this would work even if this was a one man show. And the post-credit sneak preview is ""one to die for"" - I DEFINITELY want to see the next Venom - it'll be CGI carnage...Peeps, forget the previous incarnation of Venom, this is the REAL deal. Possibly the best movie I've seen in 2018 to date. Stuff the stuffy professional critics. They haven't had any clue for the past 25 years and are no longer credible sources for good movies - much like the fake news. Go watch Venom. It's da bomb!",Venom

But it was actually pretty fun.The story goes like this: Unemployed reporter Eddy Brock played by Tom Hardy gets a story from a woman working for LIFE organazation, Eddy goes to investigate and one of the Symbiotes named Venom gets to his body. Also another symbiote that was lost and transfered it self to random people found it's way to the owner of LIFE. That creates Riot .But i have two mane complains about the film for one when venom is fully Venom its really good but when his hand is venom and his body is hardy it looks really bad.And two the main villian is not interesting at all he is bland and we don't know anything about him other that he hates venom and he is evil.Anyway i think the film is still worth a watch.",Venom
1122,jsimbumbu,"Poor cast, poor script, some bad actors plus I FELL ASLEEP!",2,14 March 2019,"This movie begins with huge potential and thus raises expectations. Herein lies the problem and the reason for so many bad reviews. It fails to live up to the standards set in the first 10 minutes. Tom Hardy's acting skills have improved over the years. Michelle is okay, but alarm bells always start ringing when I here or am able to detect fake accents in a movie. Like when a black african woman speaks with a fake American/English accent in the laboratory. I let that slide & the directors didn't let her speak again anyway. Masking tape put to good use, metaphorically speaking/writing.
But then comes the villain (Ahmed). His acting is poor. Where did they find this bad actor? There are better more credible actors playing villains in Flash season 1. Pick one from any episode. It's as if they were trying to......let me stop there. You figure out how he got the job.In fact, I can't be bothered to go on with the problems littering this film as it progresses from the score to the inept script and why should I, if they can't be bothered to make at least a half decent movie?I will say that the positive reviews of 8-10 are sooooo exaggerated they have either been bought, are from people under the mental age of 14 OR are from poverty-stricken countries where they're just so happy to get to visit a cinema they would probably give an 8 to a blank screen.2 marks for a decent begining reminiscent or plagiarised from Terminator with the first ""symbiot"" (an asian woman) playing an extremely brief role.

Tom Hardy is great as always, that guy really can act. Can't think of anyone else who would be a better choice for the role but him.
Introduction was really long, but I was not bored for a second. When Venom comes in his true form - the party starts! Wish few action scenes were less like Michael Bay's style (hardly see anything) but the inner child in me was really happy for Venom's maniacal kicking and punching around. Venom's character is really well made visually - his walking, jumping and smashing are just like in the comic books - thumbs up for that!Hope they will release R rated version on BluRay so we can see more of Venom's craziness. Tom Hardy allegedly said best parts are cut out to make the movie more age appropriate, and I think that's a shame. Anyway, I will watch this movie once more in cinema, and buy it on BluRay. After all, it's Venom!Go and see it on big screen - hope you won't be disappointed!Oh, and there are TWO mid-credit scenes - one we all are waiting for and another one that...just go and see it for yourself!",Venom

Venom and Eddies banter was pretty fun as well. 
Drake was great I wanted to like him but they movie didn't give him enough to work with. Dislikes: The biggest flaw is this seemed it was missing scenes that could have better explained the plot.

The director of this movie put everything in the basket and the result is a movie without personality that doesn't perform well in any direction. A missed chance for a popular marvel anti hero",Venom
1136,johnnygrif,Great Venom adaptation,9,1 January 2020,The only way I can make sense of this film having a 6.(something) rating is just due to differences in opinion. What can I say?Does it follow the comics? No. And therein is really the only thing I'd say is wrong with it and thus the one star missing.But forget that and the movie is great. Good action.

1138,kghosh13,A bit disappointed,6,15 October 2018,"I had read the harsh criticism about the film. And yet I went for it solely because I am a big fan of Tom Hardy.
I have little knowledge about comic characters and hence my review is unbiased. Tom Hardy is brilliant as always and there is no other actor who could pull off Venom with the casual ease as him. He wins hearts by playing this loser protagonist. There are hilarious conversations between him and the Venom and Tom breezes through this film with his usual ease. Absolutely a pleasure to watch the man act. 
However, it does look like that the movie run time has been significantly reduced. Also it seems that the film ran into budget cuts.
This is the era of brilliant graphics in movies. So much so, that we have subconsciously trained ourselves to accept only the best quality graphics in films. Venom is a good example where the quality or the lack thereof of computer graphics has a determined the overall acceptance of this film. The Venom transformation scenes required to be a lot better. The fight scene between Riot and Venom required to be significantly better. I truly believe that it has become very difficult to please audience nowadays. With big budget Marvel movies people expect nothing less than a graphic spectacle. Perhaps the reason why Suicide Squad failed to make a real impact. 
Cinematography is good and Matthew Libatique has done a good job. I can not say the same thing about Ruben Fleischer.
Overall there is a sense of disappointment when you leave the theater.",Venom

1142,homeslice2311,Meh,8,29 November 2018,"I want to preface by saying I am not a fan of the recent Marvel movies. However I end up watching most of them because they are always reliable for some easy-watching entertainment.This film was not easy to watch. The first main problem I have was the ridiculous between Brock and Venom - it's like they could not decide on a character for Venom and he does not develop at all throughout the film. I think if they portrayed Venom to be a highly intelligent and manipulative extra-terrestrial, who is just now discovering what life is like on Earth through Brock it would be much, much better.My second problem is the video effects. Basically this entire film was CGI, like most Marvel movies, but this one looked very bad for a high budget 2018 film. It's like they blew their entire budget on the transformation scenes then just slacked off for the rest of it. Some scenes looked worse than the 2008 Spiderman movie featuring Venom.Finally the portrayal of Anne was sloppy. I think the writers wanted you to like her at the end of the film, since Venom did (for some reason), but I definitely did not. This woman abandons a long term relationship for trying to break the biggest story in your career on someone who is murdering poor people. And on top of that gets with someone else just days later? Eddie I'd take a hard pass on that. Just like how you should take a hard pass on this mediocre movie.",Venom

The director really took on something more than he couldnt handle..As for the CGI wow it was really really bad... it was like a 10 year old doing it... where on other marvel studio movies the CGI looks really impressive It felt like Venom CGI was rushed and done by amateursI left the movie feeling quite disappointed and thinking had Marvel Studios had the rights on Venom they could have made this a really good movie.The critics have got this Spot OnFinal thought - Don't waste ur time and money on this movie and if there is to be a Venom 2 I really hope Marvel Studios make it!",Venom

Well done Tom Hardy and your standard awful overacting (most overrated actor in the last 20 years imo).So apart from a typically awful Hardy, the rest of the cast was also poor. Script was laughable, effects couldn't even save it! My absolute favourite part was when Venom, in Eddie's head, tells him he's a loser on his home planet too (that's not spoiling any of the plot btw!)I can only think the good reviews are people aged about 11-15 as anyone over this age should have the brainpower to realise this is a pile of garbage not worthy of the marvel name.Sorry Stan, you were a genius but this sucks",Venom

1152,rameinardus,I'm in agreement with the critics,4,20 October 2018,"There's so much wrong with this film but worst of all this movie had the potential to be great. I'm a huge fan of Venom but do not agree that Spiderman has to be in this universe for Sony's characters to thrive. But replacing the web-slinging hero was Venom was their biggest mistake. It undermines the character I love and i'm sorry but VENOM IS NOT A HERO, NOR SHOUD HE BE. What makes Venom so intriguing in the first place is his cravings to commit violent acts, like eating his victims as well as relentlessly taunting them as if he were toying with his prey, not saving the world that he is an outsider to. At first when Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock losses everything that he cares about I had hoped that he would be driven by rage towards Carlton Drake hence making him compatible with Venom. Rather than redemption he would be seeking out revenge and going to great lengths to achieve them, even if the price was his humanity. That is what Sony should have gone for. A desperate Eddie Brock trying to fill the void of loss through a violent outbreak with the help of Venom. That is the Venom origin I wanted. A dark entrance to a new villain. This doesn't limit Venom from becoming more of a neutral character in the near future but for an origin story the direction should have focused on the chaotic side of Venom.Now looking at the films flaws the script is painfully bad and makes out the movie to be more funny than its supposed to be. I feel like their mistake was to try to make the movie similar to deadpool/thor ragnarok. I don't blame the actors for this movie because in my opinion what more could they do with the stuff they've been given. Both Tom Hardy and Riz ahmed give good performances and I disagree to the criticism that Carlton Drake was miscast. Riz ahmed did great as Carlton Drake as I was convinced that his character truly wanted to explore the far reaches of space to advance the human race with the help of the Symbiotes, even if he had to go to unspeakable lengths to make that dream a reality. However for some reason his motives change which makes close to 0 sense to me but I blame the story for that. Some of the CGI is dodgy like the shuttle crash, the ambulance flip, the motorcycle chase scene, Riot...do I need to go on. Its like the studio put their whole budget into the appearance of Venom, which is hands down the best representation of Venom, EVER!! But having one great character does not automatically make a movie good. The story is bad and the majority of the characters are shallow. Logic is sometimes ignored for example the first half of the movie makes a big deal of how its rare that a Symbiote and a host can survive together but by the second half we just watch the Symbiotes switch people as if it were no big deal. Even more ridiculous is how they clearly say that the host has to be alive for a Symbiote to connect but that rule was ignored as Tom Hardy got stabbed through the chest and Venom slowly crawls to his dead corpse, then moments later they're back to fighting with Riot.There's a lot to rant about in this movie but ultimately the thing they get right is Venom (not direction wise). He's buffed out and is a force to be reckoned with, as well as loyal to his personality in the comics. The double voice conversations between Eddie Brock and Venom are the most intriguing and probably the movies strength as its leaves you wanting more. But one of the things that made me such a fan of Venom is his insensitivity to violence so when the movie got its PG 13 rating it got me thinking ""really?"" It doesn't bother me too much but if the reason behind this is to make a marvel crossover possible It doesn't mean that the standalone origin film has to be age restricted like all of the other MCU films. They could just tone it down later on.",Venom
1153,cifers,"Could have been a masterpiece, but is just underwhelming",2,30 October 2018,"What's positive:
Tom Hardy is perfect for the role and gives a great performance. Venom's appearance and powers are faithfully adapted. An extreme improvement over the Spider-Man 3 (2007) version of Venom who didn't look like Eddie Brock or Venom.
What's negative:
This movie was made by a director and studio guys who a.) don't care much about the source material, b.) don't understand the source material and c.) are driven by greed.A Venom movie done right would be R-rated, because Venom is no hero, but he is very dark and kills a lot of people. Also it would have Carnage as the antagonist, because this is the best and most iconic villain. There would be no forced comedy and no forced romance.The Venom movie we got:
A washed down kid-friendly PG-13. Venom bites off heads, but I didn't see it, I only know because he says that he did. Haven't they learned anything from Deadpool and Logan? A PG-13 Venom is like a PG-13 Sin City. Doesn't make any sense. The director said the violence here would push the PG-13 to the limit. That's a lie, nothing pushed here.The villain here is a total minor character in the comicbooks, almost no one has heard of him. Why not Carnage??The symbiote talks and what he says is ridiculous, really silly. If aliens talk, then not like that. The comedy is totally forced and not funny, just a desperate attempt to copy Marvel Studios.Pointless romance, because the studio think that helps to sell the movie to women.Bad editing. The fight scenes at the end are cut so fast that it's difficult to recognize what happens.Venom seems to be 2,50 m big. In the comicbooks he is 2,00 m I guess, but in bad Hollywood movies everything must be bigger. Bigger is not better. 2,00 m is big enough, don't you think.In short: Greedy studio and bad director show what's wrong in Hollywood: PG-13, forced comedy, forced romance, hyper editing and everything as big as possible.This movie is not as bad as garbage like Fantastic Four (2015). It has good aspects, but it could be so much more.",Venom

1156,MMOO7,Could have been better!,6,8 December 2018,"I like the style of the movie. Unlike the Deadpool, this movie has less comedy and enough seriousness that a movie like this always wanted. I like Tom Hardy and he is the actual fit for the movie for me! The story line is a bit sloppy and straight forward like any other marvel movies. There is nothing to be amusing after the second half. But still this movie has its own perks while showing that alien thing. Also the alien is so cool and dreaded at the same time! And I like that more to be honest.

Supposedly tripled the life expectancy of pancreatic cancer patients at 19 years old, yet stupidly asks basic science questions and has to reaffirm that donor and recipient transplants must match... makes so-called experts look extremely dumb.",Venom
1159,Comic_Central,"Not The Venom Movie We Wanted, But The Venom Movie We Deserved...",8,7 October 2018,"Let's be honest, every fan of the character and even new comers to the character wanted this movie to have a R rating, it's what we wanted and not a Pg-13 rating. But did this movie need it? Definitely not. This movie is the Venom movie fans of the character both new and old deserved.
Let's start somewhere simple, the acting. The acting in this movie was incredible. Tom Hardy did an amazing job portraying both Eddie Brock and Venom and was able to make it transfer over to a cinematic scale with near perfection (not uprising as it was Tom Hardy that is being talked about here!). As for Riz Ahmed, his performance as the crazy scientist, that wants to save the world, Carlton Drake was done to a high standard. This was a stand out performance for Riz in his career and will be remembered for years to come. Good performances came from other actors in the movie such as Jenny Slate (Dr. Dora Skirth), Michelle Williams (Ann Weying) and Woody Harrelson (Cletus Kasady).
The writing. I was expecting this movie to have quite poor writing, but, surprisingly, I was wrong. This movie turned out to have a very intriguing and entertaining movie and made for moments that genuinely made me laugh or at the very least amused, something that movies seem to struggle to do nowadays. I wasn't expecting this movie to be very funny but the jokes and humor was just written beautifully and presented with a high quality from the cast. I was able to write and feel for the characters and the characters arcs had satisfying conclusions and were interesting to watch play out on screen. Venom was also given a very distinct personality that was different from Eddie Brock's own personality and made the two have chemistry that made the movie just that more entertaining. The final battle between Riot and Venom seemed to be a little rushed and I would have preferred that to have more time to see the two symbiotes and their hosts clash just a little longer. They could have easily achieved this as well by cutting out a little bit from the long chase scene in the middle that almost got to the point of it being boring. Adding on that Riot could have done with a little bit more screen time to just flesh him out a little more and made the symbioses between him and Carlton Drake just a little more felt in the audience. More development for the evil symbiote also would have helped us understand his motives just a little more and helped them not be so cliche. Riot was probably held back a little because of budgeting reasons though. There are some small plot holes in the movie that were sort of glossed over, but I only noticed these after I was dissecting the plot after I had seen it. It was quite obvious to see that Sony wants to make a sequel with Carnage as the villain (like it is implied in the mid-credits scene with Cletus Kasady). If they want to do that, I am all for it and would support them all the way.
The CGI in this was incredible. In fact, the movie had some of the best CGI I have seen all year. It did look a little strange and rubbery in some parts, which was understandable because a lot of the movie was CGI (not just the symbiotes). I can stress enough how much this movies CGI needs to be praised more.The action scenes were well crafted and entertaining. However the ending fight scene could have just been extended a little more and the middle chase/fight scene could have been decreased a little, balancing the two out.
The easter eggs/references and calls to the comics such as Ann Weying been the host for the Venom symbiote (like she does in the comics) for a short time was cool and amazing to see on screen. It's those little things like that, that make me just love this movie even more. It was also good how they aimed the movie around the 90's era of the character, which is the Venom comics that Todd McFarlane is most known for (and are arguably the best comics for the character). This makes this movie just a nice package for comic book fans and movie goers alike.
All and all, this movie was a great comedic adventure that will be loved by both fans of the character and the comics as well as movie goers who enjoy superhero, action or sci-fi movies. If I had to give just one small piece of advice it would be to ignore the critics and watch this movie, you'll enjoy it.",Venom

Venom on the other hand fails at every turn. The characters are paper thin, the tone is inconsistent and the action scenes already look dated. Watching this made me wonder if Fleischer was going for a much darker tone but Marvel injected something lighter against his intentions or maybe vice versa. The poor writing doesn't give Hardy and Williams anything to work with so their scenes together are more comical than tender.I recommend watching Ryan Coogler's Black Panther instead. A much more exciting Marvel film and also very refreshing. Based on the ending of Venom, another installment will likely be coming in the near future. If I have to pay to see that film as I did for this crap, pray for me ya'll cause I'll need all the strength I can get.2/10.",Venom
1167,licarinicclo,Short coment,6,14 October 2018,"Obviously from the point of view of the comic does not center almost anything, also because there can be no Venom without Spiderman, but ignoring this I was hoping for something better. Instead the film is very disappointed because the graphics were very useless dialogues, the ""comedy"" was really disappointing. He was full of unfamiliar jokes probably written by idiots. I hoped much more even the scary scenes so to speak I hoped them much better. The only reasons why I gave him enough are obviously the cameo of Sten Lee, simple but effective, a couple of nice jokes, and postcredit scenes, with Carnage but unfortunately or maybe no prelude to a second film that I'm afraid is disappointing more than the first.",Venom

1169,iamtoxxic,Badly casted film!,1,6 October 2018,The whole movie is a cringe fest. It feels embarrassing watching TomHardy play Eddie Brock. None of the actors were right for their roles. Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed were not suited to play their characters. The movie is full of cliched dialogues. Each time Venom opens his mouth it feels like Bane is talking. There is no story. And nothing is explained well at all.I feel like either Will Arnett or Will Smith would have done a better job as Eddie Brock. And maybe that might have made this movie worth watching?,Venom
1170,kmchahine,A disappointment,4,8 October 2018,"Let me start by saying that as the trailers advertised, Venom is the anti-hero par excellence. Anyone with a glimpse of what Venom is, would agree that this movie was off target and here's why.
****Warning: spoilers ahead****The movie starts out with an interesting though unrealistic twist of spacecraft crash on Earth (the design and functionality of the aircraft are a bit futuristic, but it's ok, no major harm done). Forward, fascinating creatures on board; on escape ok; fast forward back to the lab.
We spend half of the movie trying to understand why the symbiosis is not working and this was actually interesting, especially when the idea of ""compatibility"" is provided, similar to ""organ transplant"", pretty cool. All along however, we would assume to understand why would Eddie Brock be a compatible host and we look forward to see the reasoning. Nevertheless, no reasoning is provided. Similarly, we are not provided any rationale of how the Riot and Carlton Drake were compatible or how Venom and Anne also were also able to achieve symbiosis. After spending half the movie experimenting on compatibility, then comes another chaotic sequence: Eddie Brock sick.To depict an illness with the host-parasite interaction is frankly a smart approach, but was excessively depicted. The longer this sequence, the less impressive Venom's personality became.The sudden shift in Venom's agenda from wanting to bring his people to not because he was a ""loser"", was such a bad move. Very immature and unbelievable.
Fast forward Venom vs. Riot: very useless and quick. The story seemed out of control and not convincing, just like Venom suddenly had a change in heart.Also, allowing the symbiotes to already have a name ""Venom"" and ""Riot"" was A MESS. Like seriously, English names? Really? Of the million others, would one be called Shakespeare too? The name Venom was special between Eddie Brock and the symbiote. Acting-wise, it was a shame to see Tom Hardy seemingly appearing like an alcoholic 80% of the time. I could not believe that this person played Bane to perfection, yet here he's constantly drunk-appearing with awful accent.Overall, I believe they could have done a better job scriptwriting this movie. Also, as might have noted by other reviews, Venom might have afterall needed Spider-Man to be well establish. Perhaps it is the symbiote's hate for Spider-Man and Eddie Brock's hate for Peter Parker that made Venom venomenous.",Venom
1171,foxall-21097,A movie goer of 60+ years.,9,23 August 2019,"Another movie I waited to watch on a flight. So entertaining. I did not connect Tom Hardy with the movie, such a brilliant actor. It was humorous, made me smile and chuckle, FX terrific. Well worth a watch.",Venom
1172,saparonia-42212,Loving a Monster,8,8 November 2018,"All I can say is, if you ever hung around people in the 80's who rode bikes and had long hair and listened to ACDC, there's one of Those moments in this movie where you will break out in an uncontrollable spasm of laughing. It will completely give away your past history. It's somethng to do with snacks but I won't spoil it. I'm still wiping away the tears.

In the end it's going to be better off without the MCU formula being forced down everyone's throat with her tired themes and tropes. Eddie Brock's/venom's Symbiote story is a very intriguing one that doesn't necessarily need Spiderman to succeed and I think this will prove a lot of people wrong and stupid for doubting it. Also the critics...don't even get me started on how terrible and pretentious these loony critics are where they dismantle every film that does not fit their liberal PC propaganda. The fact that there are so many sheep that will blindly follow these mindless cretins and let them dictate whether not they enjoy or see a movie R just sad human beings without any free thinking ability . Most people look at credit scores and reviews and already have their pre-determined opinions made up to go see the movie and then bash it directly after finding abhorrently stupid excuses as to why they hated it . Just go see the film for yourself because it looks to break away from the tired MCU formula .",Venom
1176,adamafrixal,Venom (2018) : not as Venomous and deadly on screen,6,17 October 2018,"First, I wanted to say that I have a quite a big expectation and look forward for the Venom Movie as it stars Tom Hardy (from mad max: fury road). But, reality often strikes hard as the film was mediocre at best and there are only few notable things from the movie itself. I would rate it about 6 at best.
The only fun things here are the interaction between venom and tom hardy, even though when they are not fighting and just in daily life. The action scene is nothing spectacular and felt can be unique and special by utilizing venom's power. The hue is kind of blueish horror but the movie can be felt jumping from comedy to action and then to horror and then back to action again which felt somewhat unfitting for the tone of the movie.
The story was nothing special, but I felt the villain is very inconsistent with his principle. I think riz ahmed can be good, but the character he plays seems to be so boring and have unclear or yet conflicting motive for doing what he does. I think that the more suitable villain for venom should provide more brawl than the one this movie provide.
My biggest disappointment is of course, the lack of violence and blood. I mean it is venom, the enemy and rival of spiderman which is vicious, but in the movie there are barely any bloods and graphic scene. It was hindering the viewers to grasp the true nature and the danger of Venom. I am sure that this movie is not made for kids, so I was wondering why the movie does not have more violence.
 
Well, not all is lost because by the credits scene rolls, we are presented by Eminem Song - Venom. Which is great and I love the song better than the movie.",Venom
1177,brasierelectric,Waaaay better than I thought it was going to be,9,8 October 2018,"Definitely liked this movie better than I anticipated. Not sure why the critics hated it so much. Pretty sure it's because it appeals to a broader audience, The creators of this movie went a bit safer with the content to appeal to a larger scope of audience. That said, it definitely pushes the limits for a PG-13 movie. Also, more humor than I expected as well ( which I enjoyed :) my oldest kid only gave it three out of 10 stars because he wanted it to be darker and harsher ( so, if that's what you're looking for, maybe you're not going to enjoy this as much as I did )",Venom

1179,hayovanderwolk,Such a waste,5,13 November 2018,"Venom is a bad film. I'm sorry I just had to start it off with that statement. It is a reaction out of pure anger. I'm actually angry at myself for being played again by the trailers and marketing, thinking this terrible movie could be good. It is a movie with a bad script, bad CGI and a cheesy story. The villain is as clishé as they could possibly make him. The boss of a scientific research lab that does experiments on people for a serum (symbiote in this case) that in their eyes is a possible life safing medicine. Ofcourse the bad guy eventually becomes the vicitm of his own creation and evolves into the real bad guy we expected him to be.Tom Hardy was the only good thing about this movie, but he has a terrible script so he couldn't really safe this movie. I still can't believe he said yes to this role. How can you fall from so high (Bane 'the Dark Knight Rises' and Dunkirk) to so low (this movie)?? The endfight is also filled with sooo over the top action that you don't know what is going on and it is just a big ugly CGI fest that is all over the place. It is there just because the standard movie formula sais it should be there so the standard audience can have their action satisfaction.But the worst part about this movie is that the choices that the characters make, have no consequences at all. People get killed, buildings get destroyed and even a giant ROCKET get destroyed by Venom but just because it is 'hidden' at the edge af a forest, somehow nobody in the world notices it. Also there is no FBI or CIA or whoever to investigate what the reason is that suddenly alien monsters are running around and destroying anything? I mean come on guys, at least try to make a story that makes sense. And don't come with arguments like: 'it's a fictional film!' As excuse for very bad writing, it is just bad.I hope that either Venom 2 gets a complete new cast (except for Hardy) , new Director and new writers OR just I hope they just stop making new films about this character for now. (probably not going to happen because it is all about money and this movie is doing well at the box office)",Venom

Ok no one won an Oscar but the actors in this did a great job. Tongue in cheek it set out to entertain. To me it did just that. I get really frustrated with the armchair critics on this site that instead of going along for the ride they nitpick everything.. Ok so you don't like computer animated action shots.. ok you're not keen on Tom Hardy.. Ok the story was far fetched.. Even professional critics get my goat but at least they get paid for it! Remember everyone has different tastes and opinions but to me some of the reviews of this film are from bombastic stuck up ""I know everything "" twits.

1182,kenc-05236,A fun entertaining movie,7,12 May 2021,When I first watched it I didn't know this movie was so polarizing. Personally I really like(as seen by my score) but it's not the best movie of the year or something. The action sequence are great especially the final battle but the human subplot drags it down a bit. Like maybe another swing at the script would have done good but oh well it's serviceable. Although humor drops the ball in some area. What I liked the most was finally seeing venom on the big screen. That may seem I'm biased but the movie was just a fun and good at times movie that I think deserve it fair share if credit.,Venom

Script is trash for the majority, but then the humour between Brock and Venom is occasionally quite funny.This whole movie is so hit and miss.

Are you sure this was made after his performances in Inception, Dark Knight Rises, Revenant, and Dunkirk!?After what seems like a lot of negativity above, although I knew what I was watching was quite poor, I surprisingly still enjoyed parts of this film. I had a similar experience with Suicide Squad. Except Venom didn't have a point in the movie where I cringed my ass off at the cheesiness of villains becoming family... I see you Diablo.Overally, because of my love for the Venom character, this movie has to get at least 3 stars. I love his whole image, and anything with his character in it, would intrigue me.

1186,nenjiavero,The critics are full of s**t!,8,21 October 2018,"Disclaimer: I'm a long-time Venom and Marvel fan, I know a lot about the comic stories surrounding this character and his story.Review:
When the first information ""leaked"" online, I was already happy that they are going to make a Venom standalone movie. As most viewers know, Venom is an interesting character who first appeared within the Spider-Man comics, but later got his own comic book series, and appeared in other comics and media too.I went to the theater to watch this movie with mediocre expectations. I was sure it won't be an awful movie, but also didn't expect the best movie of all times. What I've noticed right away is that too many people were expecting to see a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. I suppose that's the reason why all these stuck-up critics don't like it - they expected Infinity War or something like that.The movie starts off slow, and most people won't like that part. I did, because it lets us meet Eddie Brock and properly introduces us into his life. After the 40 minute mark, things get going, and the movie becomes really enjoyable. It has its fun and funny moments, it has a love story that isn't shoved down our throats, but seems natural and realistic, and it has a really well made villain. Tom Hardy has proven his worth times and times before, and this time he was really carrying the movie on his back. His fantastic acting and his natural cocky nature reminded me of the Eddie Brock from the comics. He made me believe that he is actually Eddie throughout the movie. This is especially hard to do for actors who have had a role that defined them for a wide audience, like Bane from Batman did define Hardy (similar happened to Johnny Depp with Jack Sparrow - the ""can't unsee"" effect), but he did really well in this one.I feel like someone behind the scenes really wanted this movie to work, and for me it did. It has its flaws, but every movie does. What's important is that the audience, made of people aged 5 to 50, was pleased and had genuine moments of laughter and excitement. That's what matters in the end.I gave Venom the score of 8/10. It's a fun action movie, and it doesn't deserve the bad reviews that critics have given it.",Venom
1187,megadethdragoncrimson,Venom has arrived!!,10,5 October 2018,"Despite what professional critics have deemed a colossal mess, Venom is far from that. In fact, The film's 90's Inspired vibe which I saw take direct influence from Sam Raimi films such as Darkman and Evil Dead made the film stand out in the market of superhero films that come out every few months now. There will be purists who will cry and say that because Spider-Man doesn't appear in Venom, the film is already a failure and that right there lies a major problem. I guarantee that fans had no issue when Marvel Studios decided to change the origin of Ultron as a creation of Hank Pym to a creation of Tony Stark. If you took no problem with that, please stfuwith the comic book elitist bsThe way this film managed to tell the story of Eddie Brock/Venom in a new way while honoring the comic roots really impressed me.
Yes it's an origin story but it's a new slant on it from my opinion. There are a few issues I have with the film but they weren't significant enough that it made me feel that the film was a mess, in fact I felt the film was quite cohesive narratively and tonally",Venom

1199,j-mayo1999,"Venom: The Sony Version of a MCU that needs some work, but not a bad first installment",8,5 January 2019,"Venom is a character that needed a lot of help and work. He is the favorite for a lot of people, but has only had one small movie roll that was garbage. By any means this entry was going to do better than Spider-Man 3 with Venom. How this will lead into a whole universe with Spider-Man characters is beyond me, but I like the way Carnage was set up for a sequel. Anyways, Venom takes some time to establish who Eddie Brock is and how he eventually gets to be Venom, but it seems like they take too long to get to that point. There was also a 6 month time jump which had a symbiot in a host for six months before it reached its destination. Six months is a long time for one to be in a host, even when they don't last 2 days in one person.
I would have liked to seen Eddie go straight for Drake after his life falls apart. He's desperate and has nothing else to lose. That would have been cool to seen, and to have him stumble upon Venom. Even with the movie right under two hours it still seemed like it took some time to get off the ground. Once Eddie got Venom the story picked up. I don't think the movie should have been shortened, but I do believe they should have added more detail to help with some of the filler of what happened in those six months.Now just because there are some flaws to the movie, that does not mean the characters are crap. Eddie/Venom (Tom Hardy) did a fantastic job with this character! I do not believe there could have been anyone better to play him! Once Venom finally showed up, his scenes were amazing! The graphics and everything, however some of the action scenes were underplayed. It was a risk for Sony to try and compete with Marvel. Venom did become a hug success, and with this you can expect more of Venom and other Spider-Man villains and heroes to pop up. Hopefully Sony will read some of the feedback that they are getting, and start writing for us, the fans.

Lots of exposition there, but once the title character appeared onscreen it was everything you'd want it to be with good action and lots of rampant destruction. if it weren't for that real slow first third of the story it'd be an easy 9/10.

1210,shawtylord,Average superhero movie,4,6 October 2018,This movie intrigued everyone as we knew spider-man was not in the movie so it was a mystery to see how venom stood on his own anyway they over complicated his origin and that takes a huge part of the movie making it boring with a few cringe worthy jokes here and there. The final battle is one of the most forgettable ever in superhero movies it is basically venom against another cgi copy of himself and you know the drill. This is one movie with potential but with sony in charge it is another disappointment,Venom
1211,antoniusmarcus,Ignore the critics,9,7 October 2018,Tom Hardy never dissappoints and I can't understand what the deal is with all these bad reviews,Venom
1212,mahmoodsaeed-37093,Excelent CGI but critics.,8,29 November 2018,Movie was really great but the role of anne weying is worst. Her acting is trash. It wouldn't matter but she was the main character because she was girlfriend or ex of Eddie thats what made the rating down. I'd have rated 9 but she made me do less.,Venom
1213,AndrewRMButcher,Fun but short,8,3 October 2018,"When I went to see venom I was expecting the worst (violent content wise), expecting gore, blood, etc. and for it to be a proper horror film. Although the film had its intense, scary moments, it was another marvel comedy. However, this was a pleasant surprise and made the film even more enjoyable. Tom Hardy played the role brilliantly, absolutely nailed it. But do not expect a violent horror film. The three times he did eat someone's head, it was either not viewable to the audience or contained no blood and gore and happened mostly off screen. Apart from all of this, the film felt short, rushed at points and the direction of the story changes throughout. I would still say it is a must see as I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Venom
1214,gapukas-09575,Pretty average movie,5,29 November 2018,"Venom didnt scream marvel to me, compared to all of the movies id say this is the worst one, after seeing it i wont be surprised that every movie is going to be worse just to please the masses.",Venom

1226,TrackArtist8,A loved character lost in dealings between companies,5,8 October 2018,"When I heard about this project, I thought that it would be a movie only to get a bit of money taking advantage of the current superhero wave we're going through. However, I wanted to see it because I believed that starting a cinematic universe of Spiderman villians would imply any surprise or at least innovative ideas. I was wrong. Sadly, I had to confirm my first opinion.Venom is one of the most interesting Spiderman villians and a fan-favorite. This movie confirmed me that doing a film of Venom without Spiderman is like doing a Romeo movie without Juliet. All the good material from comics is lost beneath tons of companies dealings and negotiations that push away the quality expected from the character and the story.The script is very very basic and predictable. It is basically a mix between The Incredible Hulk and Transformers. The main character fights again an evil version of himself, because suddenly, after two action scenes, he has discovered he loves the Earth and he has to protect it. Even the rythm is high, which is appropiate, if the film was longer than 90 minutes! It seems a good movie for 10 years ago. It should have learnt the way of doing this that MCU is teaching for a decade. There are no surprises, not even enough easter eggs to satisfy nowadays fans.And at the end...when you are thinking what to say...BOOM!! A misused Woody Harrelson appears to set a sequel. He could have been a great second villlian in the movie with 30-40 minutes more. Before thinking in the sequel, first think in the first film!!My 5 is due to some good things. Tom Hardy does a very good job for a difficult role. And Venom is cool. With these, you have an entertaining film, but no innovation, and I expected more, even with my first doubts.If this is what offers this strange universe Sony is starting, I think is a better idea for getting benefits of Spiderman rights to continue making videogames as good as the one for PS4, rather than getting deeper on a story that lacks of its main attractive.",Venom

Had loads of fun, the actors were good, nice action and it was funny and never boring. I don't really recommend buying it, but rent it. Final grade:B",Venom

1229,soulsplosion,we almost left the theater,6,22 October 2018,"The movie is filled with subplots, especially near the beginning, that just drone on and on and on and on. The trailers make it seem like a monster movie, but it is equally a boring reality show about a guy's life and relationship that is very shallow, uninteresting and poorly developed. Even things that are relevant to the plot meander along in a way that simply left me confused, not in the ""slowly unraveling mystery"" kind of way but the ""alright, get to it already"" kind of way. Then when it finally does Get To It, I find the action hard to enjoy because by that time I'm bored out of my mind thinking ""Jeez, FINALLY."" I find Venom's character very likeable and Eddie's character to be deeply developed and realistic , but every other character in the movie serve as shallow, stereotypical plot devices that are hardly explored.On the plus side, it has a good soundtrack.",Venom

The CGI was good, and Venom as a character is just so cool from the nostalgic 11 year old version of me that lives inside my head, similarly to Venom. Hardy acts with passion in movie that wouldn't be nearly as good without him. Honestly, Into The Spider Verse is better, but this is actually an underrated option to go with for movie night. Watch it if you've watched Spidey, and skip Aquaman! Venom: Underrated and undeservingly disliked but it was an enjoyable watch nonetheless!",Venom
1234,tomcrew-52093,Pretty good,7,5 January 2019,"(Venom stroy) A bold reporter's desperate attempt to redeem his career backfires when he is infected by a parasite who brings out his vicious alter-ego
Eddie brock (Tom Hardy) is an intrepid journalist, who doesn't know when to hold back, and this costs him dearly when he loses his job and more. His mistake? Taking on Carlton Drake - a businessman who considers himself to be a visionary, albeit with sketchy moralsIt moves quickly and is fairly good-natured, but otherwise this flatly written, uninspired comic-book action movie feels more like a paycheck-driven business decision than an artistic inspiration. (Sony no longer holds the rights to the Spider-Man character, in whose universe the Venom character originated, so Venom could have been an attempt to cling to some kind of money-generating superhero franchise.) The movie boasts some interesting creature visual effects, but Hardy is the only actor who seems to be trying. And he feels miscast as a character who's part intrepid reporter and part comical buffoon; he has trouble with the jokes' timing
What the screenplay lacks in character development, it makes up for in at least a couple of the action scenes which are well staged and executed, save for the anti-climax when it all converges into a massive CGI blob, quite literally. All hope isn't lost though. A mid-credits scene does enough to build excitement for the subsequent sequel, which hopefully will feature Venom being integrating into the Spider-verse. If nothing, Tom Hardy proves that he's more than equipped to play the sentient symbiote, but in the hands of a more adept director implementing a tauter story.But overall the movie isn't that bad that people say it was but I might reconsider it when the movie comes out on blu ray in Feb of 2019Tom.crew",Venom

The story was alright, Tom Hardy's acting was fantastic, and now I want to see Tom Hardy's Venom square off with Tom Holland's Spider-Man in a future film.This movie won me over, and I went in to it not expecting to truly enjoy this character.

Tom Hardy, a usually good actor, just plain awful. The story, full of plot holes. Venom who, if done the way Deadpool was done, could have been an awsome antihero is boiled down to 2 funny jokes and some CGI. Oh, also Riot must be the most dense villain in the history of villains since he takes on bodies of old women and little girls and it takes him 6 months to reach an airport... Or, just plain stupid screenwriting. Probably both.",Venom

I went in to watch it not even knowing about the reviews and still loved it. I thought it was a fun movie. While it does have some moments that were ""meh"" it wasn't enough for it to be a bad movie for me. I thought the casting was good, the CGI was well done and Venom's design looked way better than he did in Spiderman 3.To say this movie was bad is like saying Disneyland/Disneyworld and it's rides suck, yet you never even bothered to go see them for yourself to truly know what you're talking about. That makes those opinions irrelevant and no one wants to listen to that.Do yourself a favor and check this movie out. It's not perfect, but no movie ever is, but it is still fun to watch.",Venom
1241,scarfin-06111,Venom is one of those movies that doesn't have a clear identity.,4,16 October 2021,"Venom stars Tom Hardy as reporter Eddie Brock who doesn't like conducting interviews the way his boss would like him to. Because of this attitude, he finds himself at odds with his boss, girlfriend Anne Weying played by Michelle Williams and Colton Drake, the leader of the Life Foundation played by Riz Ahmed.For the most part Marvel movies start out slowly then continues to build up to that all important explosive ending.Venom stayed true to that trend by starting out slowly but failed miserably in an attempt to find that expected strong ending.Tom Hardy provided the voice for Venom which was one of my favourite things in the whole movie. Even though you know it is the same person speaking for them both, Brock and Venom still had a great chemistry that at times was very funny.The villain in the movie - Colton Drake, the leader of the Life Foundation did not come across as a vicious villain but more like a spoiled child who always got his way.He spoke with the same tone regardless of the situation and never used any aggression that is expected of a villain which left his character dull and lifeless.Since Drake had a vision to change humans into a much superior being called Symbiotes, you would expect him to be more vicious instead of someone similar to the nutty professor.Michelle Williams character Anne Weying was similar to Riz Ahmed's character, in that she was boring and emotionless throughout most of the movie. It was as if she just did not have the desire to express herself more intensely or if the script was not challenging enough for her. Whatever the reason, it was quite noticeable in the final product.Tom Hardy gave the best performance in this movie both as Eddie Brock and the symbiote Venom. Unfortunately though, as good as Hardy was, it still wasn't enough to save this movie.I am not sure what the writers were trying to achieve but they failed completely. It is as if they were trying to present Venom as a comedy and an action movie at the same time. In attempting this, the movie got stuck somewhere in the middle leaving it without any identity at all. Because of this I am rating this movie 4/10.",Venom

Yes maybe Eddie Brook shouldn't played by Tom Hardy, it feels like a Ben Stiller character but Tom made a great job, hands down one of the best actors in the generation.

For this movie though and for Tom Hardy i felt that is an obligation to write a review because of the critic's bad reviews.Yes, this movie could have been better. Maybe ""Rated R"" better. The critics are caught by the fact that the movie felt boring in the beginning. This movie is not a sequel. It is the first movie about Venom. It is very normal to have a story telling before any action happens. 
They must first cover the following:
How Venom came to earthWho is Eddie?How Eddie and Venom became oneHow the transition was until Venom appears?I think you need some time to cover those and the movie was not boring at all while covering those points. It was funny in a good way and Tom Hardy was really great.The action started it went on until the end of the film. Eddie was great; Venom was great and all the supporting characters. 
Yes, the story could have been a little bit better in some details and the CGI at some scenes could have been a lot better.

1253,nathesnake,Definitely deserved those critics,4,15 December 2018,"I watched this movie with the expectations of a low-rated marvel/superhero movie, knowing the movie received masses of negative reviews.At this point I have watched lots of movies, and lots of superhero movies, and I can say this is truly a bad movie. This movie had no creativity, no charisma, nothing that felt new or special or anything really. The visuals of the beast were definitely well made but other than that I can't believe this movie had blockbuster money.The plot in itself was terrible. This movie was not thought through like nowadays blockbusters are. The thirty-something guy with the good life, success, good wife, wants to do the right thing but eh there is is this bad evil corporation that is recognized and the simple fact of questioning them made him lose his job, and then his wife-to-be dump him and get herself a new doctor bf within like what, a week? This is cliche, way too similar to the amazing spider-man (same director btw), in terms of giga bio-company being led by an evil CEO.This movie is also the proof that a good actor always needs a good character to actually perform. Because really, Tom Hardy was okay at best, it was just weird and we couldn't really see or feel anything in the character, her ex-gf and his new boyfriend were even worse, uncomfortable to watch.Some people critique the critiques, but if this movie had received good reviews, I really would have lost hope in any movie evaluations. The direction and production of this movie took no risk at all, this movie was plain, and this is why blockbusters have bad reputations, because there are too many movies like this one; Lots of money, nice visuals, big-name actors, but no risks, no creativity, no new feelings, this is recycling.Compare this to recent Marvels and this is kid game. The acting, the lines, the interactions between characters and even the plot at this point sounded like a 2005 movie, where the simple fact of having incredible computer effects could give an amazing movie, but no, 2018, we've seen this thousands of time, you actually needs some thinking to produce a good movie. I am not saying you cannot enjoy it, because anyone can enjoy any movie at this point, but this is mediocre filmmaking.",Venom

Luckily, user reviews on sites like Reddit changed my mind.While Venom is far from a masterpiece, and feels downright silly at times, I found it really entertaining. Tom Hardy was by far the highlight - his Venom/Brock scenes completely stole the show. Unfortunatrly, the same cannot be said about the supporting cast, as the villain and love interest are as cookie-cutter as it gets.Another highlight was the Venom suit itself. The CGI was great for the vast majority and when Venom was on the screen (and Riot for that matter) I felt excited just to watch him. The other negatives, such as rather poor fight scenes, atrocious editing (leaving many unanswered questions), and the first half being a bit boring, don't ruin the fun and I recommend checking this one out yourself.",Venom

Don't understand what all the hate is for.After the autrocity that was Spider-Man 3, I have been patiently waiting for the redemption of a Venom portrayal that we all deserve. Although I was expecting a typical Spider-Man/Venom stand-off, doing a spin-off was the perfect move for this well-known and well-liked villain/anti-hero. Tom Hardy is, as ever, brilliant in his work and perfect for the choice. Though it might be too bold to say it was as good as Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight good, it just might come pretty dang close. My only complaint was that I felt we didn't spend too much time seeing Venom, and the movie ended somewhat quickly, despite it's running time. Not that it felt rushed or cut off, just that feeling of wanting a little bit more.While several people are pushing for the sequel to be R rated, I can see where they're coming from given the hint of Carnage at the end. However in my opinion, they will do better in the box office if they keep it at a rating adults are comfortable taking their under 17 children to. To me, more blood and violence isn't necessarily better. I would choose a good storyline and good acting over the blood and the gore. It may have worked for Deadpool, but not so much for this character. Alas, I am probably alone in this voice so it probably will be rated R, though I hope not. PG-13 is plenty. I felt this movie had the perfect amount of showing Venom's gruesome side without going completely overboard. I would like to take my boys to it when it when the sequel comes out.",Venom

It's a great blend of horrifying things (we must not bite heads off of good people), and dark humor that really resonated with me. Tom Hardy was the perfect choice to take on Eddie Brock/Venom. His comedic timing is absolutely flawless and real. I can't wait to see what he does in the next Venom movie.",Venom
1261,barktw,What were they thinking!?!?!,2,8 October 2018,"Where to start with 'venom'. The story is weak at best, it's basically all happening before you can say 'hang on a minute, what about......'. It's got massive plot holes everywhere you look. Th ending just seemed hashed and as visually incoherent as the transformers battles where you can't tell what's going on in any way. The cgi is bloody awful. There's 1 scene where 'eddie' jumps from a balcony and just stops mid air before his symbiont does what it does to save him. The gags miss the mark most of he time! I suspect mainly due to the fact this is 'in association with' marvel and not actually done by marvel. The writing is from at least another 4 rungs down marvels ladder. What a shame.

The beginning of the movie was obviously rushed and you could tell the movie was cut down to make it PG-13. In my opinion, the PG-13 rating actually works, yeah it cuts away during some death scenes but the movie is so enjoyable that you don't even care that much honestly. Overall, if you're looking for a high quality Marvel movie with a elaborate storyline, you will be disappointed.

1266,Shazam1303,Not as bad as the critics make it out to be,6,3 October 2018,"Is it going down as the best marvel movie? Let me answer that real quick: NO!Buuuuuut... I read the critics and went in with very low expectations. Judging by the critics I thought this was going to be bad. Like Fantastic Four or Spider-Man 3 level of bad. But I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised. It's by far not as bad as critics make it out to be. Yeah it could have been about 20 minutes longer to make the overall story more complete and maybe it could have had a little more action and maybe even better choreographed action sequences. The villain could have been more engaging and so on but let me say this.. this movie is being judged based on a marvel cinematic universe which is 20+ movies deep with more background and complete superhero development and story. This movie cannot compete on that level. This is a introduction movie. Nothing less, nothing more. So hopefully they'll get the second part right and get right to the point. Enjoy it for what it is!",Venom
1267,yollya,Match made in heaven,9,10 October 2018,"Like Downey was made to play Iron Man, Hardy was made to play Venom. I think it was a smart choice not to have the rating R that was originally considered because more Marvel fans can enjoy it in the theaters.",Venom
1268,ThatGuyReviews,"All Venom, No Bite",2,14 October 2019,"Ever since the release of 30 Minutes or Less, director Ruben Fleischer has appeared to be on a quest to ruin every ounce of respect he garnered for his hit, Zombieland. Given this most recent release, I am inclined to believe that his success with that film was by pure chance and fear what we have waiting for us in store with the release of the sequel next year. Still, I am inclined to recommend Venom for any cinema geeks who take joy indulging themselves in a movie so ineptly made that it becomes an unintentional comedy.
Venom suffers from a multitude of issues and, to be quite fair, they are not all the responsibility of Fleischer alone. Avi Arad, the head producer, is equally, if not more so, at fault for the disrespect this fan-favorite character has received on the big screen. While Avi Arad may not be a household name even among the most ""cultured"" of cinema snobs, he is best known for the infamous disaster that was Spiderman 3. Many blamed Sam Raimi for attempting to introduce too many villains into the movie, but Arad himself takes the blame for that decision in an interview he did for Screen Rant in September (2018) while promoting Venom. Arad produced the latest (and now even more widely despised) incarnation in an attempt to repent for the mistakes made during that film. Arad, however, has never really understood the character of Venom himself and continues to place it into the hands of filmmakers who have no clue what to do with it either. The most glaring flaw, but perhaps the most forgivable, of this movie was the lack of any relation to Spider-Man.
In an attempt to cash grab on their property, since Marvel was taking over with a refreshing look at Spider-Man, Sony executives seemed to sort through all the other Marvel characters they had the rights to and decided Venom was the one who could hold a standalone movie. After all, he had his own, individual comic run, didn't he? This ended up a great mistake, however, as Venom's appearance alone makes little to no sense without the existence of Spider-Man as a basis. Add to this the piss-poor CGI that garnered criticism before the film was even released, a script that sounds like it was written by an artificial intelligence that was fed every B-rate sci-fi movie ever made, an editing team that had no clue what they were supposed to be doing, and a miscast, misdirected collection of laughably bad performances and you get this dumpster fire of corporate incompetence. The first half-hour of this movie is a boring slog with a whiny, uninteresting protagonist, followed by nearly two more hours of hilarious mistake after mistake. While the cinematography and art direction were nothing horrifying, they were entirely average and bland. The characters felt plastic and unreal, as if they were straight off the pages of a comic, but in all the worst ways. They lacked motivation and the plot lacked any sensical direction, but somehow nobody stopped this from being released. It is an uncaring, uninspired, unforgivable piece of garbage that is better off forgotten.Venom Letter Grade: F",Venom

1278,filmbufferx,A Michael Bay Marvel movie that defends socialism...,3,25 January 2019,"To the hundreds of poor dullards starved of real entertainment and good storytelling who are raving about this film and Tom Hardy's performance in it, you are likely the reason Hollywood is turning out such limp trash most days of the week. I ignored VENOM at the cinemas and watched it instead on DVD with my mouth agape at how annoyingly puerile the film is. Then again, I'm past the age of bed wetting and know how to read so I'm obviously not the target audience.One element of the film I found interesting was its strong socialist message that pits the plight of America's poor, homeless and marginalised against the amoral excesses and indulgences of the rich who quite literally make their money by exploiting the poor and desperate. It's a fascinating subplot although of course its a message lost on its kiddie audience who want big bang smash boobs.Elements of VENOM reminded me of the reviled and largely forgotten 1997 anti-superhero film SPAWN, although primitive CG aside, that film, which of course is terribly flawed, is still significantly better.The least annoying parts of the film are undoubtedly between Williams and Hardy, but not even Williams could save the lifeless two-dimensionality of the screenplay. Williams is the more nuanced actor of the two leads, while Hardy has always gravitated towards grotesque, excessive roles that lack subtlety. Then again, subtlety and nuance is something that contemporary juvenile American audiences (a tautology if ever there was one) simply cannot abide.The true standout in the film was Riz Ahmed who played his villain very straight and never ventured into histrionics or excess. His performance was so chillingly pedestrian that when he becomes Riot the character loses all sense of threat to a silly Decepticon wannabe. I guess his underplayed performance fell off the radar for a lot of folks but its the emotionlessness and lack of empathy that made him a true villain, revealing what it takes to make it big in America.I was gobsmacked to read the claim from many reviewers that the film is not formulaic, because VENOM is absolutely color-by-numbers filmmaking that feels like it belongs in a Michael Bay movie pack. You could pretty much set your watch to the inciting incident and all those other formulaic screenplay structures that have reduced commercial filmmaking to telling lifeless repetitive stories. Indeed, the film is so horribly Michael Bay that the dialogue between Eddie Brock and Venom is uncannily like something I'd see in a TRANSFORMERS movie. ""What's wrong with that?"" I hear all the four-year-olds scream. I rest my case.",Venom
1279,Kingofthehill000,Venom is a good movie,7,5 October 2018,"Venom isn't a great movie but it's good.the villain riot could do a bit more buildup,the relationship between Eddie and venom needed a bit more development to understand venoms motives properly other than that it was great.
The cgi was spectacular,the dialogues were worth remembering,the plot was decent.how it got piss poor ratings on rotten tomatoes is beyond me.its way better than star wars as a movie yet it's review score is so low on rotten tomatoes.top critics are useless.if you want to watch a movie now just check audience reviews on imdb,filter it by total votes.avoid rotten tomatoes critics,try the movie yourself and see if I am wrong.",Venom
1280,mariannevd,Tom Hardy is a hero,9,5 October 2018,"Venom starts out with more than a few clichés. There's thousands of movies that start out with 'successful guy loses everything and is sad about it and then something life-changing happens.' It's not a bad start of the movie, it's just not special. However, about half an hour into the movie, the true magic begins.The main reason for this is Tom Hardy. I know he's is not going to receive an oscar for his performance in this movie - it's just not that kind of movie and we all know it, but boy, does he deserve one. The acting in this movie is one of the best I have seen in any Marvel movie, especially because this is one of the most complex characters to portray. I'm glad the writers of this movie started out slow and took their time to guide us through the struggle and the confusion Eddie feels at first. Yes, it starts slow, but it's not boring for a second.The only thing I wish was different about the movie is that the creators decided to make it PG-13 and not R-rated. A little more blood and swearing never hurt anyone, especially not in a setting like this. The after credit scene was on point, though. I'm already craving a sequel as much as Venom craves to eat people's faces off.",Venom

1284,roel-willemsen,"If there was any potential, I can't see where it went.",2,11 October 2018,"Overall, the film was extremely disappointing. Its positive points include Hardy's performance and the restaurant scene, one of the more uncomfortably funny scenes in a while. 
The pacing of the film is entirely off, starting of semi-promising, but having no Venom in the first half of the film and following it with a string of basic and bland CGI fights was not the way to go. The CGI is probably the worst part of the film, ranging from mediocre to downright awful. Especially the scene where the symbiote moves out of Eddie Brock's body to talk to him reminds of the 1997 film Spawn, aka awful. 
The script and dialogue are terribly basic. Michelle Williams is wasted as a love interest and is given some of the worst dialogue in the film (""I told you I could fight dirty."") 
Riz Ahmed's bad guy is somewhat interesting in human form, though his motives are never thoroughly explained, but in symbiote form he's downright awful. 'Riot' shows up suddenly at the end of the film as the big bad and is then promptly defeated in a boring CGI fight.
Furthermore, the best thing about Venom in the comics is that he's an anti-hero, something that doesn't shine through in the film. Eddie Brock's conflict about whether or not deciding to accept the symbiote is overshadowed in the plot and I believe that the film would have profited from an R-rating.
Sony should probably just let Marvel do all the work from now on. Having Hardy's Venom team up with Tom Holland's Spider-Man to take on Woody Harrelson's Carnage is a film I would like to see.
To conclude, don't waste your time with this boring attempt at an anti-hero movie.",Venom

This is so much better, with a leading actor than commands the screen rather than a smirking comic actor. Even Stan Lee's role in Venom is more worthy.

That pitch black dude inside the other dude is as funny and as nice as Hulk proves sometimes that he is, part of that unusual kindness coming from the host who takes a rather big influence on the alien. So venom, against what you might expect , as Spider Man might have left the idea, is rather a good (as good as a man eating alien can be ) some(thing)one trying to save what initially came to destroy.
The leading actor is awesome in the role and I really grow to like Venom, is funny and witty as Iron man but not as gentle as Hulk though but still he tries to be better.

I love how Venom/Eddie Brock were the main heroes of the story.I always like how Spider-Man wasn't in the movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Spider-Man fan, but, let's be honest. If Spider-Man was in the movie. He would have ruined Eddie's career and Eddie would have bonded with Venom just to have his revenge. And that would make this movie about a villain being the protagonist against the hero which is the antagonist. And that would just be wrong on so many levels.But anyhow, I love the movie so much because they treated Venom has the hero. And that was pretty awesome to see.

The dialogue in this film is a joke in itself. Clearly the writers weren't trying to make these characters act like regular people.The second half of the film is just pure comedy. The scenes with Eddie and Venom are hilarious and it creates this unnatural dynamic that somehow works.

With a movie like this I think developing the villain more would have made it better even if they didn't do so with the main character.

That intensity was missing in the actor who portrayed the villain, one of the things that really hurts this movie. There was also little chemistry between Hardy and Williams, who was sadly wasted in this movie. Overall, it's a fun time thanks to Hardy. This wouldn't succeed at all with a lesser actor.",Venom

I feel as if alot of people only know Venom through the Spiderman film and therefore were expecting something totally different.It does feel a bit rushed as a standalone film and gives an impression that they weren't exactly sure how it was going to do on release and so have held back a little but it was a steady film kept me interested, didn't do anything well doesn't do anything bad.Tom Hardy does a good job as Eddie and the relationship development between Eddie and Venom is good. I'm hoping the second film (and hopefully more) will bring out venoms character more, he lacks his Bada$$ image in this film and doesn't really feel like an Anti-hero but we shall see what happens.Would have loved to have seen it as a more darker film which it would require to really bring Venom out but obviously the 15 Rating does not allow this.That said, its definitely worth a watch and I look forward to seeing where it goes.

1308,SparxDragon,"Venom re-imagined, good concept, entertaining",7,9 October 2018,"I saw Venom last night. I had very low expectations and actually enjoyed it a lot! I liked the overall concept and philosophy of the movie, as I understood it. In one scene, Eddy Brock was listening to an Eckhart Tolle audio book... meditation was also mentioned at one point. This primed me to interpret what was later happening in a quasi-Buddhist manner, as follows: the Symbiote is a metaphor for a toxic ideology, a memeplex that uses human brains as vehicles to live and replicate. Hence, the metaphor of eating human heads. The idea that your thoughts are your identity, and the ability to tell them apart. Hence, Eddy Brock not accepting Venom as his inner voice, and instead using the pronoun ""we"". Also, different ideologies suit different people, therefore the Symbiote was not compatible with all organisms, but only some. In the movie, the subjects most compatible with the alien were people susceptible to ideology - be it philosophical, religious, or political. In the other organisms, the Symbiote could not survive for long. The alien uses the human body and its mental abilities, as well, to reach its selfish ends, meanwhile making the body dependent, and exhausting its resources. This is what memeplexes do, too. An ideology in the brain of an intelligent and powerful person would make it grow faster, because he will propagate it in a more convincing way. I liked the special effects and the creature designs. The fight between Venom and Riot was fascinating to watch. Even for a PG-13 rated movie, there was plenty of violence and it was well-presented.Acting wise, Venom wasn't bad. Tom Hardy pulled off a likable anti-hero, with his human side very similar to Adam Sandler's characters. Riz Ahmed could have been more charismatic as an evil scientist, but he did the job well-enough. Michelle Williams was very good as the female protagonist, and her character had interesting perks and strengths that made her stand out. Scott Haze was a bit boring as the main thug, I'd prefer that he was a bit more brutal and rough.What I didn't like about this movie were the countless plot holes that even a willing imagination could not fill. They were a bit distracting and pulled me out of the movie experience, but the directing was good enough to pull me back in. I can't wait for the Director's Cut version where I hope to see some of the 40 minutes that had been cut from the theatrical release. Tom Hardy shared in an interview that his favorite scenes from the movie were removed from the final cut, so we have yet to see what they will deliver.",Venom

1311,smirnoff103,Story is a bit weird,7,8 October 2018,"The movie itself was very enjoyable. I liked very much how ""bas*ss"" Venom is (especially in the middle of the movie), the special effects (the way the symbiote somehow looks disgusting to touch) , the actors performance, the funny script. But I liked a bit less the story.
How suddenly the super bad guy turns to be a good guy who's saving the world for alien domination... I know it's a spinoff but I didn't except he could turn into a (that) good guy. 
The female version of Venom (should we call her Venoma ? :p ) was also strange, a dog version of Venom could have been more interesting for example.
Also the dialogues between Eddie & Venom (or Drake & Riot) where the head was floating was a bit bizarre. A mirror-like effect could have been more logic (like after the first fight scene where Eddie looks in the car in sees the Venom reflection, or from the LOTR Smeagol & Gollum).

He stood out from the crowd and I knew he would get big one day. His portrayal of Brock is spot on and is worth the price of admission just to see it. But you'll also be entertained as well because this was a better than expected movie with good action scenes and the funny relationship between Brock and Venom. I can't express enough how talented Hardy is. It's not easy to keep transforming yourself into different characters and if you see his body of work, he is a different person everytime, and that takes major skills. Tom Cruise is always going to be Tom Cruise playing characters, but Tom Hardy will literally transform into that character, from the habits, to their accents, all the way down to the walk, posture, and stare. He must spend a lot of time studying these characters because he's almost a master chameleon of sorts. But enough about the talented Mr. Hardy. Go out and treat yourself to this great movie.",Venom
1317,akerstrom_94,Critics are DEAD WRONG!,9,7 October 2018,"I'm not even a hardcore Venom fan, but I really liked this flick, the pacing was really tight and the CGI was great! The Eddie/Venom dialogue was really good and the mid credits scene was ""insane"". I did wish Spiderman could've made even a cameo but all in all a really fun adventure",Venom
1318,vikuutt,V are Venom,8,21 October 2018,"Loved the movie, felt more action would've been wonderful though..Tom hardy fits in well and does complete justice to his role as Venom. I dont know why it received so much hate from the critics but from my point of view this movie was super impressive, fun and enjoyable. im glad that the sequel will be in works soon.",Venom
1319,mchertov,Bad movie. Even by superhero movie standards.,6,15 October 2018,"This movie is a disappointment to not only for Venom fans, but also to the superhero movie genre in general. The (extremely) shallow characters and terribly written script bring this movie down to Punisher and Daredevil lows. The action sequences are good, yes, but even that's not enough to save the movie. We've seen car chases and CGI fight scenes before. Give us something else!To add to the woes, the creators failed to capture the characters of Eddie Brock and Venom accurately. Here we have a comic and fun take on a dark, violent, and conflicted character. Venom was something controlling Brock, and giving him power. Considering Brock was depressed, unstable, and violent, this power empowered him to attack those he believed had wronged him (i.e. Spiderman). The symbiote was never Brock's ""friend"", as the movie would like us to believe. Now, I understand the studio wanted this movie to be PG-13 and cut-out several scenes to keep it at that rating. But even at a PG-13 rating, there could have been more effort to get the backstory right.If you were a fan of the more poorly received superhero movies, you will like this movie. If you would prefer seeing something on the Avengers, Deadpool, or Dark Knight level, well...skip this one.",Venom
1320,nige-lluest,Don't listen to the Critics...,8,7 October 2018,"Occasionally a bit clunky, won't win any Oscars soon but definitely a fun film nonetheless introducing a new character.Seemed to get stronger near the end and possibly had chunks cut out of it to get the age rating it was given.Scope was available for it to be darker film with a higher more grown up rating in the Deadpool mode.By no means a ""bad"" film.",Venom

It's like the writers were using improv to write this screen play, while on some really messed up drugs.Writer 1: ""Yes, and then the little girl gets the symbiote""
Writer 2: ""Yes, and then cheese falls out of the sky""
Writer 3: ""Yes, and I farted""Writers 1 & 2: *giggling like school girls*I've seen cheaply made b horror movies that made more sense.",Venom

1326,theasus,Eye candy lacking in motivation,3,6 April 2019,"In this age of great Marvel movies, this one could only have been made by Sony.For fans of Venom from the Spider-Man books, one thing is missing here: Spider-Man himself. The character Eddie Brock and the Venom symbiote are bound by their mutual hatred of Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Not so in this movie. This take on Venom, without that binding motivation, is just drivel.Non-fans will enjoy this more than Marvel fans. It's special effects are passable as interesting. I'm sure it sold a lot of popcorn, but it just wasn't very good.",Venom
1327,Rk-rohitrai,Venom 1 is just a 2 hours long trailer for the Venom 2. It was a secondary project of Sony pictures.,5,2 December 2018,"This is not a good movie. The amazing spiderman 2 all over again. Not exactly like amazing spiderman 2 but somewhere between that and suicide squad. Every thing was all over the places. Attention to detail is very poor unlike marvel movies. Very opposite to the marvel movies in the crafting of it. It's not a complete movie but more like a test run for ""Venom 2"". During action sequences It's really hard to find a place to look at. Visual are just okay nothing Stunning. They even used one shot twice. People expectations have gotten very low these days by the money it made on box-office thanks to China. It's seems nowadays all it takes to make a good movie is VFX. And I am really sad knowing that there's gonna be more like this.",Venom

1331,guyssocialweb,Wait to rent it on DVD...,6,5 October 2018,It's alright but the plot line seems scattered and meh sometimes. Last time I had this feeling was when I saw Spawn in the 90's. Didn't seem theater worthy but had that straight to dvd feel.,Venom
1332,ChrisRemix,A Very Honest Review,7,6 October 2018,"I just came back from a showing and I gotta say, it was pretty good. It wasn't great and I'll tell you why. There were a lot of missed opportunities when Venom appeared. It could've been a lot more brutal in its action sequences and there could have been better interactions between Eddie and Venom. Don't let this discourage you from watching it though. Its worth a ticket. Don't listen to the critics; they're a bit over-the-top with the hate. The beginning 30-40 minutes felt pretty boring to say the least. Sure, i was waiting for Venom but thats not why its boring. It felt the need to shove in random interactions to show us Eddie's human side. I wont discuss ""like what"" due to spoilers. It got to the point where I, along with audience, were just ""ok we get it"". Although, when Venom did finally come to light, the movie started to pick itself up again.I'm giving this movie a very fair 7/10 due to the opportunities that never came to be. It was good, but had plenty areas to improve in.",Venom

1334,jonnybee2312,100% Thumbs Up.............,10,9 October 2018,"Well what can I say? Other than take no notice to what others are saying about this being a flop, go and see it for yourself, make your own mind up and you'll realize that it's another great Marvel movie. Takes about 30-35mins for the action to kick in (Eddie and the symbiote to join forces) but when it does and the creation of Venom happens, it's non-stop action there after. The special effects are out of this world and the banter between Eddie and Venom has some funny laughts. Again take no notice to what the boring so called movie buffs are saying about this being a flop, believe me if this was the case I would say so. Don't miss out get the the flicks and watch one of this years great Marvel movies.",Venom
1335,mattwalsh91-893-231603,Fun movie. Tom Hardy kills it!,8,12 December 2018,"This was a good movie. Tom Hardy was great as Eddie/Venom, and I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. It's a good looking film, with some great effects. The back and forth banter between Eddie/Venom was done well, and there are genuine laugh out loud moments. The after credits scene with Cletus Kasady has me hyped for seeing Carnage on the big screen. Sure the film was a little dated feeling at times, but don't let that or the critics put you off.",Venom
1336,rklatt07,Almost Perfect,8,25 December 2018,"First off I'd like to say, that I have read most of the normal people reviews (not the professional reviews, because honestly they get paid to write whatever they want... which means they can watch a movie that in all reality sucks, and write the best review ever and make the same amount of money as they would if they said the movie sucked...) I'm not making a dime for writing this review. I'm just a film major, who has seen a great amount of both classic and modern films that have been unfairly dissed and unfortunately disregarded because some pretentious and arrogant European ""director"" was attached to another project that he abhorrently butchered without regard or care, simply because he could; because he was nameless he could fail and no one would notice and he could win and everyone would see: this is the modern day con artist of film. It's been done so many times in both the marvel and dc universes. These lame, money hungry opportunist directors, posing as visionaries, offering less than mediocre ""inside jokes"" for every superhero film imagined, is why the marvel and dc universe franchises are failing miserably. Newsflash, you DF: Thor Ragnarok was horrible. Infinity wars was detestable. You guys suck! And your making millions off of me?! Hell no! but everyone is too politically correct and afraid to say that he ruined and perfectly good film, because he or she (again to be ""politically correct"" aka brainwashed aka dumb, restarted, etc) wanted to win an award and add a million $$ to his or her or its net worth (for liberals who are wanting to be such amazing social justice ambassadors, they sure are missing their targeted audience completely, like everything else they screw up!) please ignore liberal stupidity and forget Obama was ever imagined or created. Approach film the way it was designed to, with even an iota of intelligence and we will take you seriously. Until then you will not make a dime at the box office because I will make it my personal mission to destroy your entire credibility and voice, like your best friend George Soros has done",Venom
1337,siru-tirronen,Confusing but funny,7,20 October 2018,"As a lot of people have pointed out, this movie is not perfect. Yes, I would have preferred a more violent, arrogant and vicious Venom for older audience, instead of this softer version. I also didn't like the animation so much but the movie was surprisingly funny. Some of the dialogues were pretty clever and brought possibly different sides out of him. Tom Hardy made also very different, but decent performance in this movie.All in all, I left the theatre quite confused, but I would like to see its sequel someday. Just give it a chance and maybe you will find Venom (2018) at least entertaining.",Venom
1338,ntinos-geros,We Are Venom,10,5 October 2018,Really this movie isn't the best but it definetely deserves a 7.5/10 on imdb so 10/10 from me,Venom
1339,andrecluff,Awesome movie don't believe the haters,9,11 October 2018,"I thought the movie had drama, action, and comedy in it. Which is the best qualities in the movie.

I think you should take time to view it.",Venom
1340,hungmosquito,Tom Hardy excels.,5,3 December 2018,"This is not a great film by any means. The acting by Hardy is far and away the best part.
The main issue with the film is its lack of subtlety and grace. It is like a bull in a china shop . I can't think of any other character in the film that was good or even memorable.
The basic plot is fine. The CGI was passable but no more than that. Essentially in a straight race between this and Suicide squad this would be my 2nd choice.Sometimes the critics get it right. They got this one nailed on.",Venom

1343,Cirative,This isn't Venom,1,17 February 2020,"Generic action movie with Venom added in. Has a completely new origin, doesn't have Spider-Man, for some reason symbiotes are prenamed, etc. Tom Hardy should not be allowed to play superheroes anymore. First he ruined Bane, then he ruined Venom.",Venom
1344,autumnrumsey,Don't listen to the critics!,9,9 October 2018,"I don't care what the critics say, I loved this movie. I have always loved the character of Venom, even in Spider-Man 3. (and we all know what a train wreck that movie was) so when I heard that a Venom movie was in production I was thrilled. The previews for it looked amazing and when I saw it opening night I was not disappointed!
The special effects used to create Venom were spectacular in my opinion! He gave off a creepy vibe and in some scenes he was downright scary. I loved the dynamic between Eddie Brock and Venom and I must say, Tom Hardy has never been one of my favorite actors and I was a bit skeptical when I heard about his casting but he totally pulled it off and now I can't picture anyone but him in that role! This movie was a great mix of action, suspense, comedy and horror.
I will admit that towards the end it did feel a bit rushed and I do wish that they had expanded a little more on Riot's storyline but still I very good movie.
If you are a die hard Marvel-Only fan there is a chance you won't be thrilled with this movie as it does have a totally different feel than movies like the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. In my opinion it was one of the darker and creepier superhero films. Just a warning if your planning on taking a small child, the kid next to me in the theater who was maybe 10-12 years old was terrified by Venom and the other Symbiotes and kept his eyes covered for most of the movie, and when the it was over I heard his parents saying that it was much darker than they had expected. Some people might not like this darker ""superhero"" movie but in my opinion it was perfect for the character that the movie was about (Venom is an Anti-hero not a superhero, there's a pretty big difference).
All in all I really enjoyed this movie and honestly I would gladly go see it again before it's out of theaters.
Do yourself a favor and don't listen to the critics, you'll miss a very well done and entertaining movie if you do.",Venom

1348,elouvennachar-14934,Hesitant ? Go watch it.,7,9 October 2018,"The critics made it way worse than it actually is. It is a solid action movie that will give you some scares and some laughs. It has some flaws. Some actions scenes could be a lot better, an R rating would also have helped. Some characters lack depth. But I think the postitives from the movie like the humor from time to time, or the interactions between Eddie and Venom and all other minor characters outweigh the flaws easily. Go watch it with some friends and you will have a blast ! Make sure to stay around after the credits ...",Venom
1349,zarastar-98898,If you don't take it seriously it was a fun movie,7,28 December 2018,I actually enjoyed it very much Tom Hardy's character was relatable cuz i too am a disaster :)) but seriously my opinion about this franchise is that they keep the visual effects team and the director but change the writers cuz it was a really well directed movie the acting was decent and good but the plot needs sooo much improvement and i hope they do it for other movies,Venom
1350,lostcultur3,A good flick.,5,11 October 2018,"I gave this movie a 5 because I thought it was fair to do so, by no means is it a bad 5, it's a good 5. It's entertaining. To be completely honest I started to feel the plot wasn't good enough. It's has the basic run of the mill plot and I was starting to lose interest in it. It changed when they properly introduced venom. That's when things started to get funny. The comedic part of this film distracted me from the mediocre plot. So if you're bored and just want to watch an entertaining movie. Go ahead. Great graphics. Amazing acting (It's Tom Hardy after all).",Venom
1351,hazzahamnwardy,Ummm...,5,30 November 2018,"This movie is decisive, it's hard to say it's amazing, because it isn't, does it have enjoyable moments?, of course, Is there things that becomes a big issue with this movie?, Yes. Let's talk about the good things, first of all, the dynamic between Eddie Brock and Venom is awesome, as a big fan of Venom, that worked very well, the banter that they have is very funny, Eddie's Ex, Annie, played by Michelle Williams was a nice add on to the movie, but isn't very important, or a character that I should care about. The villain Carlton Drake, played by Riz Ahmed, was pretty bad. Then there is Tom Hardy, he plays Eddie Brock so great, he clearly cares about the character, wanting to do the character justice after the problems with Venom in Spider-Man 3. Let's talk about the problems with the film, first problem, the movie was TOO LOUD! Jesus, me and my sister both thought, ""bloody hell, every fight scene is soooo loud"", which put me off sometimes. The pacing was a bit off, it had a rhythm, but not a good one, there would be a scene with Eddie and Venom, it would be funny, but then right after there would be either a talking scene with Carlton Drake or A GIANT FIGHT SCENE, WHICH WAS SOOOOO LOUD, then some more banter, it was a big issue, the CGI could have been a bit better, in terms of the Venom vs Riot scenes. A lot of the plot threads aren't good whatsoever, it's drags on with the Carlton Drake stuff, which is soo boring.Overall, pretty bad in terms of a movie, BUT if you are wanting to watch a movie with your brain switched off, and all you want is some fun action, then this movie is still not for you, because all the boring stuff is used as much as the Venom stuff. 5/10",Venom
1352,abbymatteson,A good movie,7,30 December 2018,"Thai movie was pretty funny and good. The story was good and I was surprised to see Jenny Craig in it because she mainly does comedies.

Pretty good acting overall, and had some funny moments. The venom kiss will forever be a meme though.",Venom

I think Tom Hardy player this role fantastic. Definitely see a sequel if they make one.",Venom
1358,creolady,Critics are snobs,7,16 October 2018,"It seems like I waited nearly a year to see this highly-anticipated movie. Was initially disappointed to hear the negative feedback from critics, but I'm glad I followed the advice of regular folks who saw and enjoyed it despite the critics' negative reviews. I am a big Tom Hardy fan, so I knew that for me it would be worth watching, even though I am not a follower of the Venom comicbook character. I was happy to read that Tom Hardy accepted the role partially because of his son's affection for the character, and that he also purposely minimized excessive violence and gore for his son's viewing pleasure, which I also prefer since I personally don't normally watch ""thriller"" films. The added humor helped create a more realistic and believable character in Eddie Brock. My film-snob friend who accompanied me was reluctant to see it, but I was relieved that he offered very few negative comments after watching the film. It is thoroughly entertaining, and I believe that Tom Hardy created a much better story and character that the average person can enjoy. I think that I'll go see it again!",Venom
1359,MindOfPaul,Better than expected,10,6 October 2018,"Tom Hardy had a great performance, at some scene he reminded me of his character in Peaky Blinders, but to get back on the movie we witnessed very exciting and entertaining 140minutes, I highly recommend this movie.",Venom

The story and filming just fall so short of my expectations. I was hoping for a Deadpool/Logan approach that usually incorporates humor and dark storylines intertwined. This movie felt very targeted towards non-fans of the original anti-hero and seems to have been severely edited with loads of removed scenes. Once Tom basically bashed the movie in an interview, I knew this was going to disappoint. Hardy delivers a good performance but you can feel a true void between the acting, writing and the actual direction of the film. However, the movie did have some cool spots in it but ultimately just fell flat for the most part. This could've been Sony's redemption on superhero movies, but they've once again proven why their vision is lagging behind by 15 years.",Venom

After hearing about the poor critic reviews I was worried because I was so looking forward to seeing Tom Hardy in this role. Silly me, I forgot, all critic reviews these days (or maybe they always were) are just so out of touch with reality. Starting to believe the conspiracy theories that they are all fake or paid for. The movie had a great plot, I'm fairly sure there was a Terminator 2 reference. It wasn't too long. I wanted it to keep going. The relationship with Eddie and Venom was fun. I can't wait for the next one. I recommend you see it.",Venom
1365,chewbaccacharlie,Rushed and Uninspired,3,7 October 2018,"Nothing about this movie was creative or fresh, it had repeated tropes and a boring and uninspired near non-existent villain vs hero ending. Not to mention the pacing is incredibly rushed and awkward, this gives the movie a lack of structure and leaves you with a script full of holes. A large problem is the comedy, most of the jokes are the same and are just seemingly shoved in at random, in addition Tom Hardy's physical comedy acting doesn't work at all in a movie like this, especially whilst acting like a drunk Ben Stiller.The music was either unpleasant to listen to or just bland stock film music. The dialogue and acting was so cringeworthy at times not to mention the very problematic editing consisting scene after scene. Would not recommend 3/10",Venom
1366,thomkitt,"Kind of Average, but Enjoyable",6,3 May 2019,"Honestly, the dialogue is pretty cringy. The plot is meh and basically unfolds like The Hulk.Despite that, the action was fun and the CGI wasn't half bad. I really enjoyed the interaction between Eddie and Venom as well.",Venom

1376,oceanwoe,Not worthy of the legacy.,4,7 November 2018,"I was very much into Venom back in the old Todd McFarlane days. This Hollywood take on the character was waaay to weak, and I don't think the director did a very good job of bringing Tom Hardy forth as Venom. He made it too goofy, where it should have dark and violent. There is violence, but it's too restricted, and a character like Venom calls for some R-rated gore. I wonder how they will deal with Carnage, as that guy is pure ultraviolence.
As for entertainment-factor, I really tried to like it, but found myself bored and looking at the clock a bit too often. A few good ideas, but overall it was just too weak. And don't get me started on that Paw Patrol CGI. Time to step up the game, FX-people of Hollywood!!",Venom
1377,collmarsch,Great film but slow start hinders it immensely.,7,12 October 2018,"JUDGEment: Venom - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270797/?ref_=nv_sr_1
7/10Sym-BYE-ote or Sym-BEE-ote? Which team are you? Either way, Venom is Fox's take on copying the Marvel formula. Trying and stumbling along the way. Movie starts out very slow. Definitely feel it is the worst half of the film. You follow Eddie Brock pre-symbiote (How do you think I said that?) While his story is good, the filmed aspect of it is boring. I felt the urge to want to check my phone. As soon as Venom is introduced into the equation, this film picks up and takes off, never looking back. Editing during action scenes cut around a lot, CGI is very good in most cases even though it looks odd at times. Story overall starts slow and then picks up and ends very fast it felt like. If you have an interest in the character or the movie, I'd say see this film. Is it one I'd say stop what you're doing to see? No. It is serviceable, great Redbox/Netflix movie. Definitely should see it but if you're on the fence or are excited to see things like First Man, I'd say go with your excitement. I saw this in IMAX. Definitely wasn't necessary to see there. TL;DR - This is Fox trying to carbon copy the Marvel formula and they do okay at it. The down times without Venom at the start are boring and slow. Once Venom is introduced Hardy shines and it becomes a film worth seeing. Should you see in theaters? Only if you want to, if you're excited for other releases this weekend, I'd pass on Venom and see it as a rental.",Venom

When it comes to this movie, Comic accuracy is everywhere. When i was watching this i was thinking, ""Now this is my Venom."" Not only is this a fun watch, its a work of art. Had a smile on my face the whole time. The only problem i had with it was Carlton Drake. I felt like i had already seen this kind of Villain with a motive to ""Change the world"". Riot was Ok...
I just felt like it should've been a full standalone movie.

1391,lukedavidboswell,A Better Venom Than Spider-Man 3,4,17 April 2019,"This film is a mixed bag to say the least.Pros;
Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock is great and he really presents a reporter who is a bit of a dick but also trying to do some good. He also does great work doing the mocap & voice for Venom.The ""chemistry"" between Tom Hardy & his own voice (As Venom) is really good and creates some funny comedy elements.The lighting is really cool in that most of it is very blue & black this representing the colour of Venom in comics which is cool.Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake is rather good and you actually see his motivations earlier in the film.The action is really cool and inventive throughout.Cons;
The CGI is really off sometimes and super noticeable.The chemistry between actual actors is REALLY bad.The pacing in the first act is really slow and only picks up when Venom shows up.The writing is really bad. E.g. ""My leg was just broken and now it's not broken."" <- An actual line.Verdict;
Venom has many flaws as a movie but Tom Hardy's charisma makes for an easy watch film.",Venom

Tom Hardy was one amazing Eddie Brock... and Venom.
I didn't understand how those 2 hours flew so fast. The theater was full and everyone was laughing their asses off. Didn't catch anyone disappointed, everyone had a lot of fun and felt awesome seeing their favorite character so well adapted.
Even those who didn't know who Venom is had fun. It was not necessary to be a comic book fan to enjoy the movie. There was nothing non understandable. Great movie from opening to closing credits.

1399,robert_e_stephenson,Better than many would have you believe,7,24 December 2018,"I've seen some dreadful reviews for Venom, and avoided watching the movie for a period because of them. Having now watched it for myself, I can say that I found many of the reviews I have read to be somewhat unfair, and its a much better and more entertaining movie than expected. Its a darker comic book movie than you might be used to, with some scenes that may be genuinely creepy and scary for younger viewers. At times, Tom Hardy's performance as the tortured investigative reporter playing host to Venom, wonderfully draws out elements of schizophrenic humour without allowing the movie to fall into slapstick. Venom is not perfect by any means. It falls victim to many of my Holywood movie pet hates, such as employing a well known British actor and forcing him or her to put on an American accent that takes a lot of getting used to, or such as making a movie pitched at a PG-13 audience, and squeezing in as much pointless and completely unnecessary profanity as possible. Nevertheless, minor gripes aside, its a well constructed and enjoyable addition to the Marvel catalogue.",Venom

I don't regret the time at all but I definitely will not try watching it again.. it is a mixture of Marvel's black superman, resident evil's monsters and some other movies.. i think there were some lines that were supposed to be funny but the character couldn't deliver and left us to decide whether this line was supposed to be funny or out of context!!. ok let's just say: don't expect good laughs as in Iron man or deadpool.. although Tom Hardy jas it in him to drop some jokes but the script was too busy making this movie all about action and tough guys. i enjoyed the action and effects but no thanks to supporting actors as they were like robots just reciting with no face impressions. Only thanks goeas to Tom Hardy.. i believe he would've raised this movie to a much higher rating if there was a better cast acting more alive next to him.I am giving it a 5 because as much as i feel; A good average movie .. if you have other choice at theatres, opt out from this one.",Venom

1405,rclldc,Thank you Tom,7,27 December 2018,"This has so much potential to be an 8 or even a 9 if some things were different. First off, Michelle Williams and Tom Hardy had about as much chemistry as you have with your 2nd cousin you see every year at Christmas. Not much as all. No one cared about their relationship whatsoever.secondly, this should have been an R rated film. Venom literally bites heads off and there's zero blood. Anywhere. Deadpool & Logan were a huge success and Venom could have been on their caliber.Thirdly, the villain was turrrrible. He was weak. He wasn't even that bad in the long run. He could have had potential, but everytime the movie got to him I'm thinking (Please put Tom Hardy back on the screen.) He had no charisma at all and was just simply boring.But overall, I still give it a 7 because Tom Hardy was THAT good as Venom. The internal dialogue between the two was funny, edgy, and kept you entertained. I loved watching him argue with Venom and try and play it off like he's not talking to himself.This movie had so much potential, and even with three big negatives, Tom Hardy saves the movie.",Venom

For the main reason, they were clearly perceived to be representing.
It seems that the whole concern of the director was on the screen a new figure, a new being from the other world unlike any other.
And it hit that goal, but the story that counts sucks, (was it a low-cost production?)
First, a journalist (Tom Hardy) who apparently had his name among the many good, who suddenly deceives the bride, showing an eguismo and egocentrismo, which disgusts. Is it an egocentric human that we want to be the new hero?
Second, a scientist (Jenny Slate) who puts a journalist who is willing to destroy that company, and tells him to go in and not mess about anything?
Third, the Owner and the company (Riz Ahmed)? Why Rix Ahmed? he has no physiognomy to play the part of a person without pity, a hard, unconscious and authoritarian person. It's a bad choice.

Venom is not a classic superhero movie where the main character gets abilities and does good things wherever he/she may go. Venom is an alien lifeform that needs a host and since it has gotten to earth it attaches to the best suitable human, which in this case is a guy called Eddy. Eddy becomes incredibly fast and strong but we don't know the parasites intentions. This is what makes things interesting. The parasite has a mind of its own and is quite hostile compared to Eddy. The conflict between these two makes the movie even more interesting.Venom has dark humor and is packed with a lot of action. The story is well written and I can't wait for a sequel.",Venom

I don't find him menacing.
I don't think there's a chemistery between tom hardy and michelle williams (his ex).

In the end, Venom It's not as bad as I heard it was and also it's not as good as we wanted it to be.

The only thing that is worth is the visual aspect of Venom, Riot and She-Venom who is awesome (for short time unfortunately) and also the choice of actors. The relation between Eddie and symbiote is just poor and miserable. First they represented symbiote like evil alien entity with bad intentions and all of the sudden, ""I like you Eddie; It's a nice view; I'm hungry, I want chips"" etc. Also, why is symbiote always complaining about something? It was supposed to be an intelligent alien lifeform and yet it sounds like a needy human b*tch very often. The movie in general is just another bad alien invasion with ""bad"" aliens. Please reboot the movie, throw Spider-Man because of the great and original origin story and I hope you're gonna make it worth watching",Venom

I think it'd have had a bigger bang in 3D, I'm disappointed over that fact.Having said that and having seen a reviewer mention the rating, I have to agree. I think it could have done so much better with a higher rating like R n MA. Furthermore, it felt as if the director and producers played it too safe and rushed it too. Always felt there could be more... That said not a bad stand alone introduction to VENOM.Looking forward to seeing what they do with the character in the future.I think Tom Hardy most definitely is the biggest plus point in the movie. Some of the jokes were funny too.Watch it.",Venom

1449,bjwils-46211,Not Terrible. But Not Great. (Not Catwoman),3,4 October 2018,"The film is incredibly generic and predictable, a saving grace is the dynamic between Eddie Brock and Venom. Every other character in this film was bland and had nothing to offer for me, and incredible waste in the talents of Riz Ahmed and Michelle Williams. Tom Hardy will always have an incredible screen presence and people will definitely enjoy this. It's by no means Catwoman level of bad, or does it deserve a 28% (or whatever it is) on Rotten Tomatoes. However it doesn't deserve to be put on any kind of pedestal for an achievement in film making either. Summary: Go see the movie, there is fun to be had here, just don't expect MCU level of balanced action/comedy and world building.",Venom

The film doesn't seem to know what it is. Ruban Fleischer has an eye for visuals but the guy has directed four feature films, only one of any critical and audience success was Zombieland. The entire cast, especially Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed are wasted with poor dialogue and weirdly placed monologues. Overall, Venom is not a turd in the wind, it is not Catwoman level of bad, but it is not on the same level of MCU blend of humour and action, which unfortunately it seems to try to achieve.",Venom

1452,adrianzoto,Good film but everyone is right.,8,8 November 2018,Okay. So this was one of the first times i couldnt give a marvel movie a 9+. But not a bad thing. The reason why is...like everyone said...the movie wasnt rated R. This movie was FANTASTIC i enjoyed the entire thing it was completely different than most marvel movies and portrayed venom completely different than in spiderman 3. However...there was alot of lost potential due to the PG-13 rating. Venom is like deadpool...it was NEVER intended to be a family friendly movie or anti hero/vigilante. However i do hope a second movie comes out with an R rating or just a second movie in general. Definitely worth the watch!,Venom

The dark comedy was spot on and Tom Hardy hit the nail on the head as usual.Just feel it could have gone better had Sony shared rights and gone full marvel.

What it is is pure escapism. It's about time a movie was just fun and made to be enjoyed not pyshco analysed and more concerned with diversity than action (don't get me wrong it's good to be diverse but at the sake of content? That's another thought for another review?).I cannot believe the critics lavished praise on Black Panther and The Last Jedi, yet slated this when Venom actually beats both for action and atmosphere. It's a real shame Venom won't be in the MCU, him fighting alongside Hulk would be immense. Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom is a masterclass in unhinged volatility and casting choice. Do not believe the pompous critics. Get yourself a ticket, your favourite drink and snacks and go and enjoy Venom. Don't over think it, don't pick holes in it, just let it wash over you for around two hours of guilty pleasure.",Venom

But for some reason I feel the need with this.I really don't know where to start with Venom... which I guess puts me in the same room as the writers and director, because the whole thing is a mess from start to finish.It just doesn't know what it's trying to be and as a result, isn't really catered in one direction or another.The ""jokes"" are regular, but barring one smirk and snigger, were more eye rolling than anything else. The CGI is weak. The characters are 2 dimensional... scratch that, I don't think they had 2 dimensions even; the acting feels like they knew this wasn't going to turn out well; the storyline... well, flawed is being extremely kind. It's barely there. The action/fight sequences feel like something from a Michael Bay Tansformers movie for the most part (anyone who just asked what the problem with that is: get out now); as for the Venon ""character"" - it's just annoying in this movie and not remotely funny.... like a turd rolling down a hill (that's an actual line.... Jesus).Honestly, there are 2 films I can think of, where I've been close to suggesting we give up and walk out of the cinema: Bird-man and this.All I can think is that Tom Hardy's fan base is extremely loyal and that others enjoyed seeing Michelle Williams runaround in a short skirt (ok, I liked that too). I pray they don't make a sequel or if they do, they treat this as having never happened and start over with it.Awful. Awful. Awful.",Venom
1489,eroch2001,Venom > Eddie Brock,4,8 April 2021,Positives: Not much like at all. The dynamic between Venom and Eddie was entertaining I guess until it got really annoying. Michelle Williams was looking nice 😍 That's all I have to say about her character.Negatives: The villain played by Riz Ahmed was so uninteresting and super clichéd. Action sequences were a CGI mess but the one in Eddie's apartment was pretty good. Movie should have been R and no one disagrees with that.

They would not be nearly as critical or have as many expectations.Trying not to be too disappointed, I lament the many inconsistencies and ""what the heck?"" moments that could have made a lot more sense if given adequate time to develop.

1493,smithz08,Tom Hardy delivers...but only he shines. (A brief summary at bottom),7,5 October 2018,"Spoiler free review. TL;DR at bottomI saw this at the VERY first opening. I am a HUGE HUGE VENOM fan. I am also a fan of Tom Hardy. I love every movie he has done almost. He can play a funny character, or a tough as nails bad ass, or a crazed lunatic, to perfection. In this movie he played a psychologically messed up person to perfection. But thats where the good acting stops. 
I felt his girlfriend was horrible. She showed no emotion, I felt it was poor acting. I also did not like the villian. I never feared him. It never built up a scary bad guy. They had to share the focus on Riot and on the man, and without going into too much detail, it just didn't work. Reminded me of a DC movie. 
Also, the director could have done better. I did not like how it was kiddy-fied. Should have been more violence and some blood, and some bad ass scenes, and there just wasn't. The movie just followed the same storyline I felt as I had seen before. TL;DR
With all that complaining out of the way, I still thought it was entertaining. I still loved Tom Hardy, and I loved most of the scenes with Venom symbiote. It just left some unanswered questions, had a typical script, a bad actress, and it was kiddy-fied trying to copy Marvel's baseline. But don't let that disuade you from seeing it, its STILL VENOM AND TOM HARDY!!!!",Venom

This film just dribbled on and didn't know if it wanted to be sex and the city or the fly, a good guy or a bad guy.
The bike chase provided a little bit of a thrill but not that memorable.
The big fight at the end just happened there wasn't any wow factor or shock value. It was like....""and then he was dead"".
I'm pleased I watched It at the cinema because if I watched it at home I would of been playing on my phone out of boredom.
On the plus side odeon nachos were as good as ever, a spicy delight.

1502,smmb-75867,Fun and Flat,7,31 October 2018,"Putting the character Venom on the big screen has had a lot of support from the comic book fan community. After his previous and shallow appearance in Spider-Man 3, people have wanted a proper adaptation of the character. I am happy to say that ""Venom"" has done that very well.
Eddie Brock, played by Tom Hardy is accurate to the comics, but it also realistic for the modern world. The writing of the Venom/Eddie Brock characters were well accomplished and believable. Their interactions with each other are effective to the story and create a character that is fighting with the demon inside him, which a lot of people can relate to.
In terms of the story, the villain Symbiote does not get very much development which is disappointing since his character in the comic books was very interesting and creative.
The action in this film was impressive and big. Although, I would have liked to have seen more of Venom's abilities from the comics presented in this movie.
Overall, this movie was entertaining, funny, and action packed. With a flat story, it does dampen the experience, but it is still a fun film to watch and a good addition to the much loved Comic Book Movie genre.",Venom

No Parker, no Beyonder reference, no explanation for why Venom looks like Spider-man's suit. Just a simple lazily written story to make some bucks. People no longer care about plot holes, acting, etc. As long as it looks good and has explosions! Brock is out of character. The humour is dumb humour. Not funny. Venom doesn't negotiate. And the thing with Woody Harrelson? He looks ridiculous! Wow! Pascal and company just don't care about their movies. America has left their brain at the door. So has Hollywood.",Venom

Seeing him fighting, and even just hearing the voice is really fun. This movie is supposed to be a cool movie, and it indeed is very cool.

Don't go into this thinking you're going to be watching something similar to infinity war or dead pool, because it's neither. Venom is portrayed as the venom that I know and love and it's film centred and focused on the eddie/ venom relationship. So when people are saying that the other characters in the film weren't utilised, I believe this was well and truly their intention. Also I have no idea why people are saying that the tone of the film is confusing. It's a dark comedy, that is the tone, there's no confusion about it.Do yourself a favour get a ticket, go watch it yourself and prepare to have a fun time.",Venom

The plot development was perfectly paced, the relationship developing between Brock and Venom was fun to experience. It was a great time!

The action scenes are insane, and there is an almost perfect mix of comedy and action, with a sprinkle of horror. My favorite part of this movie, however, was the relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom, one that i did not expect. I expected the relationship between the two protaganists to be hostile, but it was in fact the total opposite. Eddie Brock and Venom are almost friends. The only bad thing that I have to say about this movie is that some of the dialouge can be reallly cheesey, but other than that I loved it. I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes Science Fiction and Comedy.",Venom
1520,jcopple-68566,Awesome movie,10,7 October 2018,I just went to see this awesome movie and I found nothing wrong with it. Although it did start out a little slow in the first half hour but it kept me intrigued while watching it from start to finish. The acting was excellent by Tom Hardy and the CGI effects on Venom was just too cool. Ignore the bad criticism from the critics who destory this movie because they obviously have no taste in good entertainment or even know what a good action movie it is. Be ready for a cameo and a surprise at the end like all the marvel movies have done in the past. Just go see it for yourself and enjoy it. I absolutely loved this movie.,Venom

1522,bejlicaushi,The purest Marvel movie in a while,7,2 December 2018,"The reason why this movie got a bad name is because it is unrelated to Spiderman and the Avengers. It is so rare nowdays to see a comic movie out of a franchise and Venom felt like something new and weird but also entertaining. Yes in general it is an avarage movie, but what do you except from a superhero/antihero Hollywood adaption. You need to move on if find it out of place of what you have seen previously. And Tom Hardy's acting it is something that i missed watching in screen. Hope they continue the story the same way.",Venom
1523,vannah_rose,Another Marvel hit,8,31 October 2018,"Hardy did a fantastic job!
The foundation of the storyline seemed to take a bit longer unraveling than I liked, but in all the film was great. My only argument is I wished there was more interaction with Venom and Hardy's character.",Venom
1524,sollygibbs,"A messy, out of sync, but goofy and funny action flick",5,13 October 2018,"Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom is definitely a bright spot in the film. His performance is very charismatic and charming. The relationship between Eddie and Venom is most definitely the best part of the movie. The films comedy entirely comes out of their bond. It rides the edge of what is intentionally and unintentionally funny, making you uncertain about jokes in the film that may have been on the nose jabs or just a mistake. This is something that intrigued me, and the uncertainty was rewarding in the long run. Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed, while doing a fine job, are on a completely different page to Tom Hardy, in terms of their dialogue and acting. Which may have been a fault of Fleischers direction or the different movie Sony wanted to make. This lack of direction isn't only prevalent with the actors; the tone seems to be wildly out of sync with the serious tones in the first 50 minutes (which matches the trailers) and then the wacky tone of Venom and Eddies adventure, which takes a very comedic and goofy tone. This was definitely the most effective tone that should have stayed consistent with the entire movie as it was the most enjoyable and what saved this movie from being a complete disaster. Carlton Drake/Riot as the lead villain was written and characterised so poorly. The final third act battle was so dreadful in the worst ways. It came so abruptly and the fight itself was extremely hard to see what was happening. It was abysmal. Aside from all that, this film would have benefited massively from an R rating. We see Venom bite people's heads off, but there is zero blood and it feels so tame.'Venom' is an extremely enjoyable and funny movie with two clashing tones, an abysmal third act battle, a villain which is much too dull, and Tom Hardy as both Eddie and venom doing a great job. It's a mixed bag, but the positives are enough to save this movie as an enjoyable, wacky and weird adventure.",Venom
1525,MadKDog,"Solid 7 give it an 8, (watched in 2021 give it a 9!)",9,2 January 2019,It's surprisingly warm hearted - even though the tone could be darker I would be surprised if anyone didn't want to see the sequel. Hardy great in the title role and so his girlfriend Williams. I give it 8 cos' I liked the fact he rock bottom before finding allegiance with Venom who was unforgiving but then happy to be part of something. Nice to see the late great writer in the final scene too. Recommended!,Venom

However, upon seeing the movie myself, I was pleasantly surprised!Honestly, as with many similar movies recently, I feel that many viewers tried their hardest to jump on the bandwagon of hate, with some opinions barely saying anything more than the movie just being ""bad"".Anyway, if you're going into this just because you're expecting Spider-Man or Marvel Cinematic Universe connections, you'll be disappointed.But if you're going into this thinking of Venom's portayal by Topher Grace in Spider-Man 3 and hoping they did a better job of the character, then I have no doubt you'll be happy about Venom's portrayal in this one.Seeing Venom being a condescending, witty and creepy character who communicates with Eddie constantly was amazing. Exactly what I wanted.The set-up for potential future characters in a shared universe made me really happy as well. Stay for the mid credits scene!Otherwise, I really hope they continue on with this franchise and improve what viewers complained about so that they do even better next time.With the recent changes and additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I really hope that this Venom franchise gets connected somehow.",Venom

1532,jgreg-37981,"Not bad, but a wasted opportunity.",6,4 January 2020,"Venom is not necessarily a bad movie, but I felt it was a bit of a wasted opportunity.The movie has some interesting body horror aspects in the the way the symbiot interacts with Eddie, and Tom Hardy's performance is great, especially the scenes where he interacts with himself as the voice of the symbiot. There are also some legitimately funny jokes and some great fan service I didn't see coming.But the script never gives the characters anything interesting to do and the villain is about as stock standard as you can get. There's a lot of technical science talk that the movie in no way tries to make interesting. Eddies reaction to the symbiot seems weirdly backwards. He doesn't seem to notice or care that he's doing some superhuman moves when he escapes the facility after being infected, but freaks out when he hears the voice in his head for the first time. The movies tone is all over the place. The director, Ruben Fleisher has blended comedy and horror well in the past with the zombieland movies, but none of that seems to come across in venom. Finally, Woody Harrelson's wig in the mid credit scene is so hilariously obvious it made me laugh.Venom really needed a better script and a hard R rating and it might have stood a chance. We'll just have to see what Andy Serkis does with the sequel.",Venom

To slam this movie with such low scores, and yet praise the likes of Ant Man is beyond bafling. Be your own critic, if you want a fun movie, check it out.

It has good CGI work and action sequences which serve as a plus point for the movie.

1545,trpaton,You've got to be kidding me...,2,15 October 2018,"I was really wanting to like this movie, so I gave it a chance. Even though audiences liked it and critics hated it, I still wanted to see what it had to offer. This is one of the laziest films I've ever seen, and it felt as if everyone involved simply gave up with the character build-up and screenplay. The story was at least decent, yet it was half of what it could have been. I was actually fascinated the concept, but it treats the audience as if we don't know anything about good filmmaking... because the acting was pretty awful, and they delivered some of the most cliché, cheesy, and most overused phrases and sections of dialogue we've seen in films countless times. Yes, people will absolutely love this movie. But I was let down, and to be honest... I was really annoyed at how bad the dialogue and character development really was, and how the creators had a project on their hands in which they could've excelled at and given us something new. But unfortunately, we were treated with one of the most uninspired screenplays in years, along with the entire film trying to be many things in which it wasn't. This movie was barely watchable, and I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a true escape. Within the first ten minutes... I knew where the film was headed. The creators followed the typical Hollywood norms, tropes, and clichés. This movie was driven by predictability and something audiences would feel familiar with, which is something that really gets on my nerves. This movie had at least two or three enjoyable moments in my opinion. But the film as a whole was extremely and painfully predictable, cheesy, uninspired, poorly executed, and was afraid to give us something unfamiliar, in other words... fresh and new. Venom had the chance to be great, but it failed on so many levels for me.",Venom

Deadpool proved without a shadow of a doubt that an R rated super/antihero movie will fill seats and studio wallets, yet for some insane reason they went with trying to make it kiddie-friendly.

Both performances are very energetic and fun to watch develop.+There are quite a few good action sequences, lots of funny banter, and a couple of interesting ideas here and there. The flow of the movie is also fast, so you won't get bored.-The film is also sadly very generic - bad guys doing bad things, love story focus, and plot holes all around.

But it was very funny and sweet.",Venom
1574,mackjameswest,Dope Ass Movie,10,24 September 2021,This movie is just fantastic I love it do death. My favorite Marvel character is Venom so i might be biest but the action scenes were great it was funny. Tom Hardy was amazing he did the voice of Venom and eddie! Just a great movie I cant wait for the new one.,Venom
1575,megatronskywalker,This is not a good movie. I loved this movie.,8,20 September 2021,"I doubt anyone is going to be blown away while watching 2018's ""Venom"". It's a by-the-book superhero origin flick with some decent action and a CGI fight between gray blobs. What made me love this movie was the chemistry between Tom Hardy and, well, Tom Hardy. Eddie and Venom have some great scenes together, and the action in this film was shockingly engaging for a modern superhero movie. I loved this film. Not everyone will, but it's at least competently put together and is overall a fun ride. I had low expectations going in, but was pleasantly surprised.",Venom
1576,praveen-spike,Amazing,10,6 October 2018,"Saw the movie today and liked it alot, it was like Deadpool first part felt so nostalgic. The first part was a little drag but soon it was going into adrenaline sequence. I'm sure going for it again just for the rollercoaster experience.",Venom
1577,daniv1,Critics are clueless and seem to have an agenda against this film,8,11 October 2018,"This movie was awesome, and Tom Hardy was his usual incredible self with voice acting that was second to none...I have no idea why critics seem out to get him on this one but I can tell you as a fan of 90s Spiderman comics this was really great to see. Sure, it might have benefited from being R rated but oh well, its still a faithful representation of the Venom character. I love that Venom was being his normal goofy self, still trying to understand human behaviour and bond with his host. Equally good to see is his relationship with Eddie Brock portrayed correctly this time, Venom is a symbiote, not a parasite (something that Venom loves to remind people) and he simply wants to existand be as strong as possible while having some fun, he isn't really trying to hatch any cliché super-villian plans, he is just rebellious.Its a HELL of a lot better than that horrible version of Venom in the Toby McGuire era of Spiderman. This is the Venom I wanted to see.",Venom
1578,michael_paul_morley,Easy.,8,8 October 2018,"This was very easy to watch. Don't expect a deep and meaningful film. This is a straight up comic / action film.

1579,jeffholmes75,Critics are idiots,10,14 October 2018,"I went I to this movie not expecting much and was blown away. Could have been R rated but succeeded nonetheless.

The movie itself seemed rushed, like in 7th grade when you had 600 / 1000 words and you kinda just winged it hoping you'd get a passing grade. I'm hoping the second one will learn from it's mistakes and not rush it.",Venom
1582,bubbathmemoman,Just no,2,10 October 2018,"Apart from the modern (but ugly) special effects, this really looked like a direct to dvd movie from 15 years ago. What a waste of a great character and actors. Terribly bland story, ugly to look at.",Venom
1583,random_r,Not What I Expected....... But......,7,16 December 2018,"Tom Hardy is a very talented actor, and he did the best he could with his character. But as a Marvel fan who thinks Marvel movies are becoming repetitive, it was nice to watch something different other than the regular super hero movie. Now, they tried their hand at comedy which was almost equally a hit and a miss. There are also a few plot holes, in my opinion. It shouldn't be rated PG-13 either, because Venom is a beast and viscious. It should've been rated R like Deadpool and Logan. The movie feels restricted simply because of that PG-13 rating. I also think it would've been better if they had put Venom in a Spider-man movie again before making it solo. In conclusion I give it a 7, because I still enjoyed it despite what I mentioned before. Not a great run for the first movie, but maybe they'll get there.",Venom
1584,brynjar-onsoeien-rasmuss,"You see where they wanted to go with it, however...",6,5 October 2018,"There were moments i liked it, and i thought were cool. But overall it is lacking. Eddie Brock is obviously a character that Hardy didn't really care for. Overall this is a movie struggling to figure out what it actually is. It has no personality or charm. It's difficult to follow. But you see what it could have been, and it's decent with popcorn and soda. It's just not really making you clear up time for that second viewing.",Venom
1585,BraveGraphics,Watch this with zero expectations.,7,16 December 2018,"When it comes to super-hero movies you have to consider one thing, and that is to watch the film with zero expectations.
Venom is actually your typical Marvel movie with the same premises that we usually get. Random guy get super powers, a villain, a cliche love story..etc. This formula will always work, why because this is what we expect from a super-hero film. Venom as a character is very interesting and was misrepresented in the ""Spider-man 3"" film. But in this film, we actually get to see the Venom that we loved in the comics and Tom's acting is superior in this film.
This is a good start for this character and I do hope to see more from it in the future.",Venom
1586,ToniFGMAMTC,"Yes, you should go watch it",9,7 October 2018,"We really enjoyed it. We saw in opening night & haven't stopped talking about it. Everyone in the theater during our viewing had a great experience watching it from their reactions during and comments after. We watched it in 3D. I do recommend upgrading to the 3D if you're able. Tom Hardy is funny. The inner monologue between Venom and E.B. made everyone watching laugh more than once. I could have did without the cheesy romance bits, but they don't get much screen time so it's all good.

The downside perhaps is the lack of comedy which I expected to see in a Venom story. There was some for sure, here and there, but not enough. However, as mentioned, this is the first movie out of probably at least three. We may have more of Venom causticity. Transform scenes were very well made, car chase in San Francisco worth watching as always. Tom Brady did hell of a job, do not bother reading bad reviews about his acting.

I'm not going to ""spoiler"" this movie for you however consider my points.1. This movie only follows the original Venom extremely loosely. If you're expecting a movie true to the comic's....look elsewhere as that Venom was a villain, this Venom is a anti-hero. 2. This movie does take a Venom character and creates a origin story so you can understand why they are aligning Venom as a hero. They do keep some of his ""characteristics"" like his unique brand of humor, how he isn't bothered by killing, etc. This movie does a great job showing that, while still allowing my 12 year old son to watch and enjoy without me fearing him seeing too much.3. They create this setting as a Yin and Yang between Venom and Eddie Brock, 1 half a good guy, 1 half a bad guy and their ""bond"" to become one. Tom Hardy nails this performance, if you read this...well done!4. The CGI and special effects are good, even great ""most the time"". There is some instances that this suffers some. Didn't distract me, my son didn't even notice and raved about them for the rest of the night.In the age of SJW/White knights and virtue signalling in major movies, this movie did a bang up job ignoring all that and just showing you a movie that will make you laugh multiple times, build up the plot with well defined ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", enjoy multiple action sequences, and walk away feeling happy you bought your movie ticket (well as glad as you can be with the $$$ cost of popcorn lol).",Venom
1598,MarioSync,Good movie,8,5 October 2018,"Please ignore critics people, probably just they just tired writing for Marvel movies. The movie is worth to watch in cinema, Tom and michelle did a good job, they are complementing each other, granted cgi probably need some improv, some parts does not really blending with the surrounding, and feels like something from wax museum. However I have a great time watching this movie from beginning till end, look forward for sequel.",Venom

1608,wfjohnston14,Unsure of What it Wants to Be,3,22 October 2018,"Venom is an uneven mess with poor writing to only drag the movie down farther. It's not gritty enough to be dark or funny enough to be comedic. It wants to be something new but doesn't end up being its own thing. Rather, a mashup of successes other superhero films have done with comedic dialogue, a bigger badder yet similar villain, and redemption story, but all of those aspects are poorly done.Eddie Brock's life goes from bad to worse really quickly as his once successful life quickly goes to the toilet. The film jumps into things which isn't always a bad thing, except it paints Eddie as a self righteous prick with little evidence that he had the personality to be successful. After falling on hard times, the attachment to the symbiote Venom changes things and now, he's back to having power (this time in the supernatural form). His relationship with Venom is odd because their banter is poorly written with Venom talking way too much, saying really moronic lines, and rarely being funny. His reason to sticking with Eddie through all of this is weak as it feels thrown in at the end just to make the audience go ""aw"" for their relationship. In the end, it turns into what it was advertising not to be, a hero film. Michelle Williams's character is thrown in as the love interest and does nothing. She doesn't change or do anything other than be there for Eddie. Tom Hardy is always entertaining to watch even when the material he's given isn't written great. I care enough for Eddie in this film because I admire Tom Hardy. Not because Eddie was made into a likeable character or well developed or anything. Sure beats the villain who feels like the stereotypical bad guy: man is greedy; wants more; gets the power; let's the power take over.The story itself was one of the few things that was okay for most of the film. It all flowed well but was mostly blocked out by unrealistic dialogue and weak character development. Sadly, in the last half, it seemed unsure of where it wanted to go and became routine and predictable. There were only a handful of entertaining moments and two funny moments throughout. I cringed through most of the film. Thinking back on it, I have a bitter taste.I see Venom working if it followed similar techniques Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom did earlier this year. That film wasn't good either, but it filmed its dinosaurs like a monster movie. That was really effective and I can see Venom doing that. What would've helped is if Venom did not talk and instead was indeed more like a parasite in Eddie's body then another personality in the host's body.This film only leaves me angry and bitter. I can see areas it could have become but instead it went with what has been drawing in audiences rather than taking chances. And that's what puts it in the gutter in the end.",Venom

1. I am very much surprised by how much I liked this movie.
2. Humor in this movie is persistent from starting to end so it will make you laugh throughout the movie that you won't see any other DC,Marvel movie these days and which should be the most important aspect for a movie.
3. Best acting by Tom Hardy, He is most suitable hero for this character in every aspect.Best decision made by casting director for this movie.

1613,angelocalypse666,Not a fan,4,11 October 2018,"I went into this movie with low expectations. The trailers did nothing for me. Plus they're telling an origin story for Venom without Spider-Man. That is just wrong. But nevertheless on a rainy Thursday evening on the 4th of October I went to my local cinema. Watched the movie......and I did not like it. There were good parts in it for sure, but it definitely didn't work for me as a whole. Here's why:First off, the good. This is actually a hilarious movie. There were a lot of moments in this movie that made me laugh hard. Violently even.Most of it from the interaction between Venom and Eddie Brock.The way Venom talks to Eddie in his head is brilliant, I especially love Venom's reactions when Eddie calls him a parasite. A lot of laughs were heard in the cinema. Funny that the trailer didn't tell us that this is going to be a funny movie. It really is. Makes you wonder how the reaction would be if they showed the comedic bits a little in the trailers.And that's where the ""goods"" end for me...Let's go to the bad, shall we. Let's talk about the other casts. As I mentioned above, the chemistry between Eddie Brock and Venom was great. Tom Hardy is a great actor and he did a wonderful job in this movie just like he does in every movie he's in and I'm a big fan of his. The rest of the cast though, was pretty bad. Michelle Williams as Anne Weying who is Eddie Brock's ex-fiancée is totally forgettable, except maybe for that 1 bit near the climax. If you have watched it, you know what I'm talking about. Besides that scene, Anne Weying is completely forgettable. The character of Dora Skirth played by Jenny Slate also felt flat nearly all the time.Then there was Riz Ahmed. My God, Riz Ahmed. He was absolutely bad in this movie. A dead person have more facial reaction than this guy and he had an emotional range of a teaspoon (yes, that was a Harry Potter reference). This guy is not believable as an antagonist at all. He was the worst part of this movie. Mr. Freeze from Batman and Robin was a better antagonist. You get the feeling like he doesn't care about this movie and is just there to pick up the paycheck.Now, let's talk about the PG-13 rating. This is a movie begging for an R-rating. Certain scenes featuring the symbiotes could've benefited from it. It would have made this movie better. Not by much, but still it would have made it better. We live in a world where R-rated superhero movies do work. Deadpool was awesome, Logan was amazing. Venom was a no-brainer for an R-rating. I know why they went for a PG-13 rating (wanting to eventually join forces with the mighty MCU) but was it worth it in terms of the story you want to tell? The rating certainly hurt this movie.Overall, Venom is not the worst movie ever in the genre. This is no Catwoman or Elektra or Fant4stic. It is not as awful as that. You can watch it and have fun with it.",Venom

1616,thats_just_like_your_opinion_man,Thank you Tom Hardy.,5,9 October 2018,"'Venom' is a film that has been through production hell and has taken a long time to get to our screens. After the film's marketing run which I feel in my opinion, didn't leave people thinking about rushing to the cinemas with mammoth expectations to see it. 'Venom' was better than I expected and it surprised me.Tom Hardy is excellent here and fully embraces the ridiculousness of the role and it works 100%, anyone else in the role and it wouldn't have worked. The relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom is the saving grace of the film and it provides a lot of comedy which is hilarious. Sometimes, I couldn't tell if certain things were meant to be intentionally played for laughs or not, and it didn't bother me. The film at times feels quite self-aware of what it's doing and knows what its trying to be. During a certain chase scene, the action mixed together with the comedy created an incredibly entertaining sequence.There are a few characters who are in a completely different film. Riz Ahmed is a terrific actor but his character and portrayal doesn't work. The villain is very bland and boring. Michelle Williams is also a excellent actor but her character doesn't work. Both characters take up so much screen time and are rather underwritten. Mix all this in with a very quickly thrown together generic superhero third act, some dialogue that just doesn't work and a few plot holes.When this film works, it is fantastic and the highs are really high. When the film doesn't work however, it creates some seriously conflicting tones, cliche's and just makes you wish you were watching more of Eddie and Venom. I enjoyed this movie and am looking forward to a sequel if it happens. It did enough good for me, but upon further thought it has its problems. Also, 'Venom' doesn't really suffer a lot from being PG-13, however, an R rating would've been interesting and preferred.People will have very differing opinions on this film. If you love it, I get it and if you think its garbage, I get it. Go watch it for some fun, it is hard to not have a laugh during the runtime, whether you are laughing with it or at it.C+ = 5/10",Venom

He's a character who's known mythos exists because of his enemy, Spider-Man. That aside, this film was a new level of awful. Patchy plot, terrible dialogue, hard to follow action, horrendous exposition delivery in one scene and a dreadful villain. But boy did I enjoy this film, I laughed my ass off from the second the out of place rap song came on at the beginning to the rap song in the credits. Amazing. Incredible. Perfect. Dreadful.",Venom

Man did turn out to be something awesome than I ever thought.By the way I usually dislike superhero movies whether its from Marvel or DC but, this I really liked.I get where the critics are coming from. The character idea had way more potential and could have been better if the screen writers had more patience and develop a better screen lines. But I was left happy and in awe. Granted a big part of why liked the movie was because I had no idea how awesome the idea of Venom was (since I never read the comics).Also, the action scenes weren't anything special or jaw dropping. We're in 2018/19 so we got desensitized to most of the action scenes and its hard to top it off. It takes real creativity to think of good action scenes and moves. But then again I didn't enter expecting action moves as Mission Impossible or a Jackie Chan movie.Personally I'd say 7or8/10 but I also understand why an old comic fan would give it a 6/10 or less.",Venom

Anyway, he was tour de forks, as per usual, and Michelle Williams was given an abundance of material to work with, she was multidimensional just like how Dino is sometimes bipolar.

I came into this film with no expectations and whilst it certainly isn't perfect, it is a million miles from the mess the critics made it out to be.The negatives first. I felt Venom's change of heart towards humanity was kinda rushed and thought his character suffered as a result. Also the rating thing possibly effected it as i thought there would be more action scenes.Whats left of those however are the undoubted highlights. One in particular with some police was my favourite scene in the film. There's good chemistry between eddie and Venom and i dug Hardy's performance.So in short, goof, not great but enjoyable and will watch again!",Venom

I loved seeing the action! It was an imaginative and fun little movie that I will gladly buy on bluray! Sidenote: Tom Hardy really saves the movie for me!

The movie was fun, intriguing, and energizing. The only reason I'm not giving this a 9 or 10 is because I felt that there should have been more screen time where Eddie and Venom got used to one another. The moments that they talked were few and far between. When we reached the climax, Venom had changed his mind about Earth yet barely explained why.Overall, this movie was great and I cannot wait for the sequel with Carnage!",Venom

1660,cjmouch,"A solid film, but nothing amazing",8,23 October 2018,"Ok, so with all of the mixed reviews on this film, I thought that maybe I should write a review for once.
So Venom basically follows a guy named Eddie Brock who is fired from his journalism job because he strayed off during an interview, bringing up controversial topics with a major science company. He then sneaks in with one of the workers to figure out what's going on. At this point in the movie, (I will warn you because I wasn't warned and I have a small degree of epilepsy) there is an intense sequence with flashing lights and colors and sounds. A cool sequence, definitely adds to the film, but just a surprise. Eddie Brock then bonds with the symbiote known as venom, which was brought back from space by the science people.
It definitely is an action packed movie, and it pushes the limits of PG-13 ratings. A few F bombs and some graphic (but awesome) violence.
The relationship between Eddie and Venom is easily my favorite part of the film. It's almost funny how they act together and how out of place Eddie is in all of this.
My main problem with the movie is the villain. I forgot his name, to be honest, but he's played by Riz Ahmed. He just didn't seem right for the role. Although Riot was a very cool symbiote as well, and the film left up something cool in a post credit scene hunting to Carnage, this was the weakest part of the film.
I would NOT reccomend taking a child to see this movie, it's very intense at some parts and scary at others. If your kid is over 12/13 they should be fine, but even then it depends on the child. Overall, I would give Venom a 7.5/10 but I rounded down just because of the villain, who just wasn't well written.-cj",Venom

Yes it takes about 20 minutes to get going but once it does it is brilliant. Hardy is superb as Eddie Brock and his some great conversations with Venom inside of his head.

1677,amaracastitate,Good for laid back sitting,7,10 October 2018,"Venom was delivered with a fascinating pacing. It might seems slow in the beginning until the middle, but it's not uncommon for an origin story. The writer builds a good-not the best, but good-anticipation for the audience. 
Although this movie is suitable for your relaxed, laid-back-popcorn-munching movie night, it was not fulfilling in the terms of the climax and the way it resolves itself. The action was messy with the usual shaky-cam, but in this case it was worsen by the fact that the protagonist and antagonist was not easily be differentiated-similar color scheme, similar voices.

1686,trexhunter-26422,Venomus Fun,7,16 October 2018,"Before we even begin this is better than The Mummy, so this cinematic universe will at least make it to another film. With that out of they way I can talk about Venom. Though lacking in the beginning with clunky dialog and pacing issues it soon picks up and gets to what we are here to see. Venom, and all his PG-13 glory? Though the rating does hinder it at points it still is a ton of fun. Characters:
Tom Hardy is a great Eddie Brock. He is clearly having fun with the role and is loving it. The rest of the cast isn't so notable. None of them are bad but not notable.Dialog:
The dialog is hit and miss. It can be laugh out loud hilarious one sec to clunky and sounding like a robot the next. Though when it's good it's good, every banter between Eddie and Venom is great and shows a bond between the two. Tom Hardy again does great work pulling double duty playing both Eddie and Venom and doing each great. The dialog when good is funny and provides a good bit of fun to some boring parts. Action:
The action is great. It can one minute be a scene like Aliens where one by on people are picked off, to a Mad Max car chase that was awesome. I give compliments to the director being able to balance each type of action well throughout the movie. For me the car chase and the swat team battle are two standouts for me each giving two types of action scenes that show venoms fighting style with Eddie in tow. Though the ending battle is your typical CGI slug fest it is short and to the point. Horror:
Though not a strict horror film it has some horror moments. The lab scene is awesome and well paced allowing the lighting, sound design, and acting to sell the creepy nature. Though I wish there was more horror moments to help sell the horror of the symbiotic relations but what we got was good. Pros and Cons:
The first act of the film is slow, cliche, and rushed. There is a lot to criticize in the first few minutes are a prime example of how not to write drama. It is slow and after a time jump happens witch usually don't help a films pacing. Another gripe about the first act is Michael Williams. The 4 time Oscar nominee doesn't do that well with being Eddies lover. Some of her line delivery in the beginning is boring and phoned in but, as the movie goes on she becomes better and is a fun contrast to Eddie in the film. Something else the film has against it is the tonal shifts throughout the film. It goes form an action movie, romantic comedy, horror, comedy, back to a romantic comedy. With some elements working well and others not so much making the film somewhat disjointed. Pros:
-Great Direction
-Tom Hardy
-Venom and Eddie Banter
-Good CGICons:
-PG-13 Rating
-Some Clunky Dialog
-Boring Dialog
-Rehashed IdeasConclusion:
Though lacking in some parts it is still an entertaining ride that is fun. It doesn't deserve the critical mauling it is getting but had its valid problems, though not deserving its 31% Rotten Tomato score. First Score
7/10",Venom
1687,pronusx,"Wasted Potential, but Still Different!",7,18 October 2018,"Venom comes very close to shedding its Marvel pedigree, portraying scenes that are genuinely disturbing without feeling the need to cut tension with a joke, and indeed the first forty minutes or so feel like something wholly different than anything that came before. However as Eddie Brock slowly succumbs to the Symbiote so follows the superhero archetype, and by the time Venom has revealed himself in full he reminded me too much of characters I had already seen before. With all that said I would recommend watching this movie because it does take some risks and that alone was enough to make it fun, but don't be surprised if you come away wondering what could have been.",Venom

This epic movie blew my Mind. This fast paced movie has all the stuff you want for example there's one scene where he run over by a car his pinky finger and leg were broken all of a sudden venom the creature mended his leg and finger the screen was showing that for like 5 seconds.Negative
This movie was a bit weird I. Sometimes that didn't even need to happen like the girl venom kissed the boy venom which doesn't make sense like what was the point of that I think it was to make the film longerEdits

1699,shakerahathaway,Amazing Movie,9,6 May 2019,"The world may have enough superheroes, but it doesn't have enough good movies about them. ""Venom"" goes a small way toward changing that, even though it's technically about a supervillain - or, if we're being generous, an antihero. News that the fan-favorite Spider-Man antagonist was receiving a standalone film of his own starring Tom Hardy was greeted warmly by those who harbor a childhood fondness for the character.
All is well with Eddie Brock when first we meet the mild-mannered reporter, who takes his investigative duties seriously and relishes speaking truth to power. Eddies latest assignment is on a high-tech entrepreneur Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). The genius inventor is of the opinion that human beings are a weak, imperfect species, and so he looks to the stars for an answer to his problems. What he finds is something different, of course. The film begins months before Eddie meets Venom, when a rocket carrying an alien lifeform harvested from a comet and soon to be known as the symbiote, a parasitic being that shares its superhuman abilities with its human host. Drake- who funded the cosmic expedition describes the pairing between parasite and human like an organ transplant: If the symbiote and its host aren't a perfect match, the body will reject it and eventually die.
As much a body-horror thriller as it is a comic-book movie, ""Venom"" is also similar to a buddy comedy in which one of the buddies has to prevent the other from biting people's heads off. If that sounds ridiculous, it is - but ""Venom"" both knows it and uses it to its advantage, playing up the dark humor. Not all of Eddie and Venom's exchanges land as intended, but those that do are genuinely funny; over time, their relationship even becomes endearing in its own way, which comes as such a pleasant surprise it's almost enough to recommend the movie on its own.
Marvel has established such a consistent formula in its cinematic universe that this radically different approach will surely be jarring to some, but the fact that this movie could never exist in the same world as ""Captain America: Civil War"" despite hailing from the same brand of comics is part of its charm. As for the actors, Tom Hardy is notorious for giving it his all-for digging in deep, physically and emotionally, for every role he plays, so of course Hardy applies the same intensity to his role in ""Venom"".
This leaves the viewer with two choices: reject the parasite or let it take you over. Fight it off and you'll have a bad time; become one with it and you may achieve a kind of symbiosis.",Venom
1700,MeAvaallen,DECENT MOVIE,7,5 May 2019,"In my opinion, this was a very decent movie. There are things to take into account before watching it, like what are your expectations towards it. I would not say that this movie is a horror movie. Far from it. I think this is an action/sci-fi/comedy movie.

1710,raskarl,Awesome (anti) superhero movie,10,3 October 2018,"I went to this film with no real expectation beyond knowing that Tom Hardy was playing in the main role and Venom is from the Spider-verse. I walked away thinking what a fabulous job had been done to bring good mixture of action and comedy. I really enjoyed this film and am unsure why people would have rated it down. I've heard some say the acting was sub-par, that is not something I noticed to be honest. I don't go to these types of movies expecting Oscar worthy performances, but to be entertained for an hour or so. This film achieved that easily and surpassed expectations. I even had a few laughs thrown in for good measure.
If you are on the fence about whether to see this film, I would recommend you go see it - you're not likely to regret it. Also, I'm 80% there is going to be an epic sequel sometime in the not too distant future!
-Update; I went to see the film again for a second time...still hit the spot! Great soundtrack and there's a short clip about an upcoming animation film featuring some characters from the Spider-verse.

Definitely hope they make more, this was a standard origin story with lots of treats for the eyes, nothing wild story-wise but it's a fun movie and Tom hardy is the most likable Eddie Brock you could ask for, which in a movie is kind of necessary. I Worried about the PG-13 rating going in, but it didn't stop Venom from doing what he does one bit. I'd say any gore absent is not sorely missed and isn't for lack of violence. I thought it was handled well.I'm hoping we get another movie with more focus on Eddie living with venom and doing a little more crime fighting or whatever equivalent activities Venom is capable of.

My just turned 12 year old daughter also loved it and laughed through much of the show, especially once the action started.....and didn't stop. Of course, she has a wonderful sense of humor and gets most jokes. The violence wasn't gory or graphic, almost comical in some instances. For us, this show had the right amount of action, comedy, and absolute entertainment. It was just FUN!All in all, it was a wonderful experience at the theatre, totally satisfied.

1722,Nordved,"Fun, engaging, but far from perfect",7,7 October 2018,"First of all, Venom is not as bad as the critics and youtube reviewers make it. 
Tom Hardy puts up a strong, interesting, and sympathetic performance as Eddie Brock. Venom creates a funny and, at the same time, vicious component in the film. The villains, Riot and Carlton Drake, make a threatening, cynical and almost psychopathic presence throughout the film. And as the plot thickens, audiences will most likely experience a suspenseful climax, where the fate of humanity is at stake. Last but not least, Michelle Williams is quite the beauty - but also more than just eye-candy.However, the movie lacks substance. We need to dig deeper into Eddies psychological breakdown, and how venom is attracted to his negative emotions. This is a huge part of why venom wants to bond with Eddie, after all. This is slightly hinted, but ultimately drowns in the sequencing of the scenes, which almost solely focuses on building up action-scenes instead of character depth and development.
Although Venom is funny and almost sympathetic, this character aspect is sort of straying away from how the symbiote is in the comics/cartoons. In the source material, the only reason behind Venom's moral choices comes from Eddie's ability to, eventually, control the symbiote and use it for good. I can see that this might have appalled audiences from the character, however. Still, Tom Hardy's scenes and Eddie's transformation is engaging, which makes us sympathize with the character. Ultimately, the film's main message is how aggression can be liberating, but also employed into moral virtues.7/10 for a good film that has several problems but one extremely redeeming quality; Tom Hardy.",Venom

1737,messyshirt_1,Extremely poor storytelling dragged it down a lot,3,27 October 2018,"Not a huge fan of superhero movies but I enjoy trying to keep with with some Marvel lore from time to time between all the movies. I'm not well versed in spiderman/venom storylines from the comics so it's just a take on the movie from someone wanting to see a decent superhero flick with action and laughs.This movie barely delivered on the laughs and couldn't even scrap together any memorable action scenes. Venom's awful storytelling definitely begins with the incoherent and messy script, with multiple plot lines leading nowhere and a villain that challenges the cheesiness of phase 1 marvel villains in blandness and forgettable lines.Tom hardy as Eddie Brock seemed to be the only redeeming quality in this movie, using his natural charm and persona to interact with the venom creature in a meaningful way. However, his initial backstory as a news reporter was told in a matter of minutes at the beginning of the movie as a series of montages. Same thing with his relationship, quick few scenes and BOOM cut to 6 months later after everything goes downhill for Eddie. The movie spends roughly 30 minutes on 2 absolutely useless plot points involving symbiotes, adding nothing to the story and dragging it down even further.The jokes were a hit and miss, but a lot of them just came down to 'the venom symbiote is talking funny in Eddie's head teehee!'. The comedy was one of the better aspects of the movie in terms of enjoyment.The action? wow, it was downright handheld garbage for a good 80% of it. The character of venom looked pretty good most of the time, and big fans of him will be pleased to see his CGI on screen. The issue is 2 of the bigger fights involving venom fighting the villain and his goons of course take place at night and are barely lit enough to gain a coherent visual on the action. Venom absorbs heaps of bullets and damage and leaves Eddie without a scratch, yippee. The final fight played basically like Black Panther's final fight in terms of being a forgettable, dimly lit mess with no memorable action.I'll try not to spoil anything, but the movie basically boils down to ' bad man wants bad thing to happen to earth, but good man who make past mistake try to stop bad man because he bad!'. No subtle underlying themes or messages. I'm not asking for Kubrick levels of subliminal messaging, but the story had no substance to offer whatsoever, except for a hamfisted relationship that's been played out to ensure the audience connects romantically to the movie, which of course adds nothing to the already barren story.",Venom

I'm writing a review for this one not because its my fav movie of all time (its not), but because I feel the critic ratings are way off. Most give a rating equivalent to terrible, but I throughly enjoyed this movie. The comedic elements were great and made the movie that much better. I enjoyed the storyline (I don't know much about venom from the comics so i don't know how that compares). The action scenes were well done and the music fit the vibe of the movie. Now, Do I feel the movie could of been even better if it was rated R definitely, but i think this is a good start and I look forward to the sequel. Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams on screen chemistry had me a lil concerned at the beginning of the film but by the end I really liked how well they meshed together.

I think the critics must have been recently lobotomized or something because this movie is awesome! The ONLY reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is (spoiler here) at the end of the movie (before the credits), Eddie is casually talking to his ex-fiance and updates her on his investigative life. Well, Eddie/Venom just killed dozens of people. Yes, Venom was the one in control, but I doubt the police or anyone else is going to see that. They all got a good look at Eddie before he transformed into Venom. So, how is Eddie out and about like nothing happened? I think there should have been something slipped in to help explain why he wasn't locked up for multiple homicides. Sure, all superhero movies you just have to roll with and accept it (i.e. Thor -- really? A god from another planet?) Just roll with it and enjoy. But rolling with Eddie not being in trouble for all that just isn't sitting right until a reason is given.Other than that, I absolutely loved the movie! Tom Hardy nailed the part spot on!

Certainly considering how awesome this anti hero can be, it's hard to imagine how this film could have gone so wrong.Sadly, it just doesn't work. The closest I can get to pin-pointing the problem is the character direction. These characters and actors are all pretty decent, but they seem somehow stunted in this timeline of flat, non-emotional dialogues for a good few hours. Better direction of this film may have saved it.Otherwise the film is quite good. Venom is a fantastic character and concept and I'm gutted this film didn't do it justice.

It's no masterpiece of a movie, but as a comic book movie it's terrific, lighthearted, action packed and really doesn't take itself seriously but in the best of ways.
So very cliche but in a good and endearing way.It's a very nice pause from the normal MCU movie universe where we've been fed the same stuff over and over again.Eddie Brock is a weird but fun character and venom fits him perfectly. They're a terrific anti hero couple and not much else is needed to be said because they're the only somewhat fleshed out part of this movie, the rest of the movie is basically happening around them.
Badly written review but not much else is needed really, it's not a movie with deeper meaning or with a message to deliver.

Hardy is excellent as always, and while the story may be generic it's still a perfectly enjoyable film. The stunts are amazing, the car chase scene especially. Plot holes? Maybe one or two slight inconsistencies but again, nothing major. It's a perfectly enjoyable film and I would definitely recommend to see it and judge for yourself as the critics often get it wrong (The last Jedi, black panther etc)",Venom
1757,jessy_thibeault,"I was going in to hate it after I had seen Rotten Tomatoes Score, turns out I wasn't displeased",5,5 October 2018,"It is officially my first review on IMDb and I think that it is about time for me to spill the beans... Dear movie lovers, Rotten Tomatoes can be right on a lot of things but can also be wrong. I went to see Venom tonight with the only thing in my mind which was to hate in to its core. But I left the theater with a grin on my face. This movie isn't flawless, the reactions going out were a lot of ""It was so short, could at least lasted half an hour more"", this is all due with its pacing. Venom has a really fast pacing which doesn't allow the audience to feel like they're invested in what's most important in movies, characters. Also a lot of cheesy lines and plot points seem like they're not always on point with what you want to watch. But, Venom has really cool action scenes, great humour and also a delightful duo between Eddie Brock and Venom. My only point is this, if you are a general movie lover who just wants to tske a chance by seeing this movie then do so. I believe if Fleischer makes enough at the box office that he'll do a great sequel if he fixes his issues up because what has been teased in a post-credit scene is something I wanna see next. Enjoy everybody, Venom is quite fun",Venom

The movie failed to make a lasting impression and there were so little surprises. Its like sitting in a Cog railway making your way gingerly upwards.

1769,martinjackson81,Almost there.,6,4 October 2018,"Having just got back from an IMAX viewing, I would say that venom 'almost' achieved what it wanted. You walk away feeling that maybe an 18 certificate would have done the character Justice and you do want to know more about the 40 minutes left on the cutting room floor. There is plenty of action (in the second half mind) and venom himself works well (most of the time as CGI characters can be a little too quick in the real world). It is amazing too how quickly we humans can heal after being thrown 20 or 30 feet into a car! They do bounce back quickly in this film as if nothing happened. I did like the relationship between Tom hardy and venom and thought that some of the wisecracks worked. People's reactions to venom differ from 'oh for the love of God what is that...run' to 'oh, ok'. Imagine how you would react to him!Yes, there are missed opportunities and we should have got to venom quicker in the film (as some reviews have noted a bit of bordem) but I will certainly get it when it comes out 4k/ Dolby Atmos as it did sound great and I am sure I will enjoy it more of repeated viewing.",Venom
1770,kent-liles,SCREW THE CRITICS-FREAKING FIGHT ME,10,11 October 2018,"A movie that discusses the dark voices inside one's head is not only rare, but also endearing when it's pulled off right like the movie Upgrade, or this new released Venom. What made the movie great not only lay with its dark comedy, but with its genuine characters. What I see are friends and villains being nasty to Eddie Brock (played by Tom Hardy) which blurs the lines of who is good or truly selfish. The critics and much of the inferior likes of them say that everyone is stale and one dimensional because more screen time was given to Venom. But that's the point, the story revolves around our anti hero and not anyone else, whom played very well in their roles. For example, the villain was a scientist with a God complex, and what him a person was his beliefs into making society better with science, which is an understanding ideal if not simple because we all want things to get better. 
Or his girlfriend, whom everyone says is trash and stagmatic, but that was the point to her character, she IS trash because she dumped Eddie and went with a doctor six months during their breakup. She IS stagmatic because her character is the type who does not share her feelings (like a LOT of freaking girls and guys I know alike). Another reason why I think it's good is because of what the story takes from an unoriginal plot line. I won't spoil anything, however I will say that the plot is your stereotypical patient vs the mad scientist, the story is different though. It's about what we do to suppress the demons we deal with inside, while also trying to be good. And that's a genuine thing people go through, for we all go through our inner struggles and try to be the best we can be (if not then they're complete dirt bags). It takes a moral ground foundation, which Hollywood and several of their paid reviewers hate because they don't want to differentiate what's right and wrong (which is stupid considering the fact we have laws that deal with murderers and pedophiles).In conclusion, this movie is both underrated and cool, taking unoriginal concepts and turning it into their own charm. Which is probably why it's getting more money in the box office is because we love it. Screw the critics, they obviously can't tell what a good movie is anymore because they're so focused on politically charged films to be on screen so that the propaganda that they invest in more money on trash films like that instead of genuine stories (which is another thing I loved about this movie). This movie is comedic, dark, light, and doesn't take itself too seriously, much like its character Eddie, or as the symbiote we all love, Venom.",Venom
1771,Deniz1999,Overall good fun,8,10 October 2018,"First of, I don't know why critics gave this movie such a bad score, because it is genuinely good fun. The story is nothing special, and the ending was a bit rushed, but thanks to Tom Hardy's performance and his conversations with Venom, it really kept the flow going. Should it have been R rated? Yes. Does it ruin the movie? No. So just go see it, if you haven't already",Venom

I'd heard the bad criticism and had really low expectations but really found myself loving the movie from first view.Yes. Tom is the best. BUT! The rest of the cast is really good and deserve their praise. Even the homeless chic, mrs cheng and the first lab rat do their jobs great! Personally, I liked the bad guy. Good acting. He delivered what the script intended. Could the writers have developed him better? Erm... yeah.Pros:
1. Tom's performance, of course AND Eddie's very relatable life, vulnerable character and I really buy his relationship with the girlfriend hook and sinker. I even like Dan! I mean, come on! The turd's a decent guy!2. Bits and parts in the script is cleaverly left out. How you never get the part about WHY you'd even WANT to collect bodies in heaps - in the corner(!) It's hilarious!
You never get how the whole nutrition plan works explained in plain dialogue. And somehow I'm OK with that. The humans never find out and why would a symbiot just plainly ever explain that in normal dialogue? You're right. They wouldn't. I guess you could call it a plot hole too, but... how would you get in there?!3. Eddie's and the symbiot's interactions is absolutely wonderful. It has a freaking personality! The first time they cooperate is just, ""yup!""
Love how they made Eddie move during the fights. You just think ""wow!"" And ""of course that's how the symbiot would do it""Cons:
1. I really miss the R-rating. The censoring really takes the edge off a movie that really IS an R-movie.2. The effects are really bad at times it makes me cry! Why?! The rest was totally fine3. The lines of the robber are so bad it hurts.Lastly and the absolutely biggest shortage of the whole movie:4. That is NOT Venom. Venom is NOT any form of loser and would never view himself as such. THE Venom does NOT have this personality, it's more clever, less humane. THE Venom is a purely bred predator and animal-like. Buuut! For what this movie is, it's hilarious with wonderful performances from ALL cast members! Do I want to see the sequel? Absolutely!P.S.
""Annie"" is not a weak stereotypical woman. She's a very well-written character.

1775,LordLongflap,"Fun movie, don't expect quality",7,21 December 2020,"My big takeaway from this film was to just have fun. Don't go in expecting stellar character work or great writing, this film doesn't provide that. However it does have some solid action scenes that keep the mood light despite featuring a monstrous alien biting people's heads off. Hardy gives a decent performance, and is just about enough to keep the movie going, but the supporting characters are quite unconvincing and play pretty standard archetypes. Compared to DC's 'adult' offering in ""Joker"", this film barely stacks up, but if you've got kids who have grown up watching the MCU, this film is at least a fresh take on the Marvel formula.",Venom

1777,hutomo_gates,Not Bad but A Bit Boring,7,3 October 2018,"Nothing too special for the plot. A cliche plot for superhero movies, even though Venom is not a superhero. He is a Anti-hero. There are several dialogues that are not too strong to deliver the message. Some scenes should be epic but its ruined by some bad dialogues. Some actor's acting seemed futile with these deficiencies. The climax of final fight is not too 'wow'. The conclusions of final battle is not clear enough. Music score is not that specialSome positive aspects that can saved this movie are relationship between Eddy and Venom. Dialogues between Eddy and Venom can be ice breaker or melt the tense in some scenes. Some Eddy and Venom's interactions also generate some comedy scene and it's quite entertaining. Awesome final battle between Venom versus Riot. It's very exciting and the CGI is very quite stunning",Venom

1783,mvinogradsky,Venom in my experience,10,17 October 2018,"This was a great movie in my experience. I didn't know what to expect when I walked in the theater and sat down. I never seen any shows or movies with Venom or know much about what I was going to see. But as the movie went along it quickly grabbed my attention. I loved how the plot was set up and there wasn't any time during the movie that lost the audience attention which is very important when making a film. The movie consisted of different camera angels such as bird eye view, close up, mid range, etc. which is key when showing action scenes and car chasing scenes. Eddie the main character in the movie is a casual regular guy that didn't have a lot going on (when he became Venom) which I think is pretty cool because most super hero movies the hero is usually a popular guy or someone wealthy. But In this film Eddie an ordinary guy which captivated the audience more in my opinion because people can relate more to it. I highly recommend this movie to someone who hasn't seen it unless you don't like action movies or a Nun. Michael Vinogradsky",Venom

1785,sakurayumi,"An enjoyable movie, despite its glaring flaws.",7,30 March 2019,"At first, I was quite sceptical about the new venom movie as I thought that a Spider-Man villain movie without Spider-Man would be kind of odd. The critics rating for this movie is also the lowest rating that I've seen in a while, with the metascore being as low as 35. However, I came across the trailer when I went to the cinema and decided that the trailer seems cool and ended up watching the movie. And I'm not disappointed with the movie.The movie is quite different from my expectations. The trailers made it seems like the movie will be an action thriller anti-hero origin type of movie. Yet, this was not the case. The movie is a lot more humorous, and the dynamics between Eddie Brock and Venom is way friendlier than the trailers made it seems to be. I cannot judge the accuracy as I haven't read the comics, but I can definitely say that I enjoyed the dynamics between those two characters. I also feel like Tom Hardy had done a brilliant job on portraying Eddie Brock. His version of Eddie is very lovable and realistic, and I love every bit of banter that he has with Venom.The movie also has some amazing action sequences. It's nothing that would keep you at the edge of your seat, but it is definitely enjoyable. The humour is also good. Although it does have a tendency of ruining the overall thrilling vibe sometimes. But I'm not complaining as I definitely found myself laughing plenty of time in the cinema.However, I understand why plenty of movie critics hates this movie. Most of the people who came to the movie probably expect to see an action thriller movie, and the intro could be too long and boring for those kinds of movies. The overall writing is also quite weak at some points and I can spot some plot holes throughout the movie. The plot itself is quite cliched and unoriginal, but I guess that it is a common thing for superhero movies. The CGI is generally fine, but there are some scenes where the CGI seems cheap and downright disappointing. Especially considering the huge budget that is used for the movie. But I guess that the biggest reason why most movie critics hate this movie is the villain.I found the movie to be enjoyable overall, but even I should admit that the villain is quite disappointing. Villain characters are supposed to be threatening and believable. However, Riot is none of that and I consider him to be a forgettable character. Although to be fair, the only characters that I genuinely enjoy are Venom, Dan and Eddie himself. The rest of the characters are mediocre at best. There is another thing that disappointed me about the movie. The movie originally supposed to have an R rating, but Sony decided to cut a lot of the scenes and turns it into a PG-13 movie, and I hate it. I felt like they had butchered down the movie for the worse and that a lot of the scenes could've been improved if they don't have the limitations that apply to PG-13 movies. You can't butcher down an R-rated movie and turns it to a PG-13 movie without messing it up. I would love to see the original R-rated version on Bluray or something similar.Overall, I found the movie to be enjoyable and funny regardless of its many flaws. After all, you won't see some of the flaws unless you try to analyze the movie or read deeply into the plot. This movie is great if you want an enjoyable action-humour movie to watch with your friends and family. But don't expect a deep and dark action-thriller movie because this movie is anything but that.",Venom
1786,dsijan,Lying Critics! What do they expect from a movie?,8,16 October 2018,"Sure, the movie started off slow.
The first 30 minutes or so sets up the story for Eddie Brock, getting knocked down in life and eventually infiltrates the lab where the symbiotes are, to find a news worthy story and get back on his feet! 
Thats where the movie begins!!! 
Hardy and Venom trying to get along! That was pure fun!
The movie has laughter, actions, thrill ...all that a comic based movie needs! Venom is just how I imagined he would be! 
For me, the movie wasnt at all disappointing except for the little screen time given to Riot and the final fight (The fight was cool but was finished way sooner!)
Could've included other symbiotes! Would have love to see them!

1791,jacob_havener,Better than expected,8,10 October 2018,"Before watching this movie I had heard many bad things about it. Honestly I was disappointed I wanted this to be a really good film. After the terrible portrayal by Topher Grace in Spider-Man 3 I wanted a good movie with Venom. I decided to go in and see the film for myself. I actually enjoyed the movie. The film has many flaws and I will talk about them but first the good stuff. The movie delivers when its trying to be funny. The back and forth between Eddie and Venom is fantastic and quite funny and I wish that there was a bit more of the interaction between the two while Eddie is trying to have normal conversations with other people. At first I didn't think I would believe Tom Hardy as a reporter but he fits quite well with the way he was written and as always Tom Hardy gives a great performance. So some negatives. The PG-13 rating is a problem, it should be R and a lot more bloody and gory and the movie really should have shown the intensity and the savagery that Venom is. The action scenes could have been better, for the most part they were good but the final battle should have been a bit longer and I wish we had seen more of Venom during the day because black on the night sky is a bit difficult to see. The villain of the film is a bit cliche but still tolerable. Overall I honestly found the movie enjoyable and not bad.",Venom
1792,gummy_bear-09760,Decent movie,7,8 December 2018,"First and foremost, this is NOT the same Venom as exists in the Spider-Man comics. This is the the anti-hero Venom that was modifed to be its comic ""hero"". With that in mind, here goes the actual review.They did good job creating a character to build from for future movies. The merging of Brock and Venom was well developed and acted out quite well. This was an enjoyable movie that had good humorbut wasn't excessively violent as the Venom character typically is. It also didn't force pointless sexuality into the movie. All-in-all this was a pretty good movie I would let my kids watch.",Venom
1793,stuart-hill,Venom... lacking Venom,6,9 October 2018,"Average - Venom's character was modified to please the audience, he lost his really dark edge and it was replaced with almost a hint of deadpool humour. Brock's character was flawed also and less dark than his equivalent comic book character, almost pathetic in a way.The symbiote thrives off Brocks hatred and anger and there didn't seem to be any of that within Brock which was disappointing to see. I really hated Spiderman 3 (2007) but that portrayal of Venom is more true to the comic than this experience, producers have a word with yourselves and put some Venom in Venom!!",Venom

1798,supermlman,"Weak, but entertaining",6,17 October 2018,"RATED R!!!Ahem, with that wishful thinking out of the way:I am going to be brutally honest and say that ""Venom"" is not that good. It's really not. The effects are decent, the acting is good enough yadayada, but the plot is very weak and the character motivations (or really, Venom's motivation) is simply retarded. Speaking of Venom, there's actually very little of him in the movie. But that being said, it doesn't deserve a 3 out of 10. It's far from an unbearable movie. As dumb as the plot may be I still did enjoy seeing our main character interact with his new 'buddy' (once he showed up). And again, once the action gets going, the movie does get really fun.
I just have very mixed feelings about this movie. On the one hand I think it was a missed opportunity, but then again, they hint towards a sequel in the end, which I would happily go and watch so it at least succeeded in that regard. If you want to watch this movie, just keep in mind that you're not getting the best of the best. You're just gonna get silly, braindead entertainment.

1799,haddonbledsoe,The critics are treating this like a turd in the wind,8,6 October 2018,"Based on all the negative reviews I had read for 2018s Venom, I walked into the theatre expecting a very mediocre movie just as it was described. It turns out that I was very surprised and enjoyed this movie a lot. Sure its not great, but it's at least good, enjoyable and fun.Many people ranted about how elements such as the relationship between Tom Hardy's character and Michelle William's character was not good, that the first 30-45 minutes were boring, that the villain of this movie was just not intimidating and kind of dumb, and that the plot in general was messy. Either my expectations for this movie were so low or the people reviewing this are exaggerating because1- there is a reason why Eddie Brock and his girlfriend are in a messy relationship in the movie so obviously they don't have chemistry
2- the Carlton Drake villain is just a jerk in general and psychotic with no regard to human life. He reminds me of my boss, which is why i was totally okay with his portrayal because i hate my boss. Why are people even complaining about this character if the movie itself is about a villain called Venom. 
3- unlike most superhero movies where they throw in an action scene in the beginning, the Venom movie uses these ""boring"" first 30 minutes to build the plot. This is how we get to know Eddie Brock who is just as important as a character as Venom.The pacing did not really bother me unlike most people, but that's because I'm the type of person that is not just entertained by cool action scenes. By far this movie should not be compared to anything with the MCU because this movie is not about Spider Man. It is all VENOM.Tom Hardy, even though he is clearly used to playing oscar leading roles in oscar movies, still proves himself worthy to act out the script he has been given. Yes, it seems strange to see an actor like him in a movie like this, but he does his best and i appreciate it. Especially considering that he did this for his son. So good job Tom Hardy. The movie could have definitely been rated R, but even with a PG-13 rating, it worked. Venom is still the brutal /anti-hero we know and love. For a movie that does not involve spider man, i believe VENOM did a good job.",Venom

1801,azbayarz,Tom Hardy alone brings 5/10 points,6,8 June 2019,"So, where should I start. I wonder how they tricked Tom Hardy to play in this extremely mediocre ""Hero"" film. I didn't expected much from going into this film, but I got extremely disappointed either way. I thought Venom was supposed to be Villain or atleast NOT HERO. But this film is like Amazing VenomMan.",Venom
1802,eetusopanen,Gritty reboot of The Mask I didn't know we needed,4,6 October 2018,"I'm at loss with words. On one hand this movie is a ridiculous mess with no clear rythm or structure. On the other hand it's one of the funniest experiences I've had for the longest time.
It's like someone decided, that they wanted to combine The Mask and The Room, and turn it into a superhero-movie from the year 2003.
Tom Hardy is great as Jim Carrey, who gets infected with the biggest sociopathic and monstrous gay icon from outer space. Together Eddie ""Jim Carrey combined with Tommy Wiseau"" Brock and Venom have more chemistry and personality than rest of the cast combined.
This movie is like a trainwreck, which somehow managed to become a beautiful, surreal sculpture after the crash.
If you want to see a good movie with great writing, and a good balance of drama and comedy, don't see this movie. If you yearn for an accidental dark comedy with what feels like the longest chase scene ever, then this is the right mess for you.
Even though I loved every second of this burning pile of trash, except for the boring and confusing beginning, I can't give this a good rating.
Venom isn't a good movie, but it's an amazing farce.",Venom

My guess is that 40 minutes cut was at fault here. Except that, great VFX, amazing sound scores and great acting from Tom. But the story was too simple. Would rate it 5.5 out of 10, if I could.I am looking forward to the director's cut. Maybe that will change my mind.",Venom
1804,lschouder-04582,Sucked,3,6 October 2018,"Meaningless goop-centric cgi scenes can't save this movie from mediocrity. First the obvious: a Spider-Man villain whose origin is dependent on the wall crawler who is VERY noticeably absent and who proves that he doesn't really deserve his own film. Without Spidey around, Venom's existence feels pointless, his origin bland and dull and the stakes never feel meaningful. Even his costume just looks like black vomit without the prominent white spider symbol that SHOULD be there. I've heard the movie called ""fun"" and it is if you turn your brain off. It's fun in the way a Rambo movie is fun; bad dialogue, flashy action, dumb plot, lots of special effects. Is it a good movie? No. Not even close. Does it do the character justice? Well, no. Without Spider-Man, how could it? Will the masses like it anyway? Probably.",Venom

Tom Hardy should avoid being casual.
There is nothing more UNfunny and awkward than Tom Hardy in this ""movie"".Everything about this movie is awkward. The first act intro and set up, the endless cliches, the contrived dialogue, the special effects circa 1998... it just never stops, and it seems like it never stops.I had very low expectations and WAS so disappointed.
I feel embarrassed for everyone who worked on this movie.
This is not venom in my voice, this move is poison for your mind.This move pushes the overpopulation myth and climate change while consuming how much resources to make it? Hypocrites and bad ""filmmakers"".Endless American wars, corrupt American politicians, bankrupt American healthcare, AND lousy American movies and propaganda.

Physical comedy and situational comedy done right; many scenes that connect both characters symbiont and host as one while both are facing and fighting different demons. True to the Venom character I remember reading in comic books when I was a kid and Tom Hardy; who has his own style does well in the collaboration proving once again just what a chameleon he really is. Michelle Williams is a stand out serving her own brand of heroism and intelligence that feels believable and in no way makes you think of her previous roles. Great writing, directing and cinematography; again, at no point are you pulled out of the movie every shot you are right there with the characters trying to figure your way out.

My friend and I went to see this in the theatre opening night and we had an amazing time. We both agreed that Tom Hardy did an amazing job as Eddie and Venom. I can imagine that his work playing two characters in the movie Legend might have helped him out a little. The plot isn't anything special but I'd still recommend seeing the movie for Tom Hardy's amazing performance. Not to mention it's a really funny film and I can't wait for the sequel.,Venom

1818,wilia_kurnia,"It's not good, but it's also not that bad.",6,7 October 2018,"Venom took new step into new direction from Spider-man's Villain-turn-to hero in this movie. I know that it would be difficult to create a new concept about this anti-hero, and the result is this not-good-but-entertaining movie.The plot and the story is really mediocre, using the mainstream concept of good vs bad guy. Some dialogues felt too cliche, and some cringe-worthy, but maybe that's quite some effort to make a fun and entertaining movie rather than dark tone movie which ""Venom"" is supposed to be. The acting is all about standout performance from Tom Hardy, other than him it's just okay. There are lack of character developments, especially between Eddie Brock and Anne. It's just felt rushed and unnatural of their relationship, from almost married then turn to broke up really fast without strong reason and explanation. Carlton Drake as the main villain is too one-dimensional typical villain with no strong character and background. Eddie Brock is so goofy and unconvincing so that he just got into Carlton Drake and interview him, then frontally exposed his evil plan on national television, although his boss already warned him not to make such bad decision. No logical explanation why Venom is compatible with Eddie Brock and also Anne, but other symbiotes often not compatible with their hosts. No exposition why Riot chose Carlton Drake as his host (although I know it's because Riot already know that it's Carlton Drake who summon them into earth and their shares of same idealism, but still it's not explained in this movie). And one common problem in superhero movies which also happened in this movie, that they sometimes forget logic, such as big car chase and wreck-havoc in town situation without any police try to stop them (?). There are still more, but I think those are my biggest issues in this movie.However, I agree that this movie is not as bad as critics say. Relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom is one of the best interesting aspect in this movie. Their relationship and dialogues felt more convincing than any other character dialogues in this movie, and until the end I began to care about Venom and Eddie Brock unique friendship. Action sequences are fun and thrilling, I can see that at least they put a lot of effort in making a good-looking movie filled with good CGI and special effects. Overall, the positive things in this movie is that it focus on pure fun and thrill, and making audiences entertainedI'll still be looking for Venom 2 and definitely will watch it, but I also hope that it would be better than this movie, at least more well-developed also better villain (Carnage) and character development.",Venom

The best thing about this film was Venom himself. He looked nice and threatening. The setting was OK.
The bad out ways the good. Tom Hardy's character was very bland and boring and the villain wasn't the best, Sony had created much better villains in the past. It was mainly bland, forgettable and mainly confused with the tone.

There are so many things about this movie that bring it down that I'm wondering if the people who rate it 9 or 10 out of 10 saw the same movie I did. Let's start with the script. Its laughably bad at times (the dialogue is borderline funny), and there are so many cliches (theres even a giant monster fight on a rocket at the end). Almost all the acting is poor to bad, especially Riz Ahmed who I can only describe as Elon Musk but a stereotypical Mavel villain.The only good piece of acting is Tom Hardy (because hes Tom Hardy), but even then I hope he doesnt think Americans sound like that. The only reason I give this a 4 instead of a 2 or 3 is because the banter between Venom and Eddie Brock is genuinely entertaining most of the time, and theres a couple of good action scenes.However, it's really not worth the 10 or 11 bucks you gotta pay to see it.

1838,dushchenko,Worth watching,8,9 October 2018,"One of the most awaited premiers in 2018 was reboot of Venom by Marvel. It was released last week and I couldn't wait to watch it. So, I've went to my favourite cinema right away, but decided to finally try 4DX. And the movie is appropriate for it.
I can agree that it was definitely a great experience. The movie is full of action and immersion into it was pretty deep I'd say.
Will be Venom a good creature, or bad one? Will Venom control Eddie Brock by absorbing him, or the last one gonna be in charge? Is Venom a stupid bloodthirsty animal, or is he smart? These are question you have in your head before going to the cinema. The filmmakers tried to keep intrigue as much longer.
I'm a fan of Marvel movies and waited for this one, of course. In general, it's a cool film. Graphics is incredible. Venom and other species there look so real like in any other movie. And there is also my favorite Michelle Williams. But, Tom Hardy was on point as well. It won't be fair, if not to tell that the cast is just amazing.
But, actually that's almost all what I can say about it. If I haven't watched it in 4DX, I suppose that my impression could be even worse, unfortunately. Don't know what the authors did think about, 'coz the plot is so predictable. Why they decided to do it like that? Wonderful graphics, but simple plot. Hmm...
Of course, there is perfect humor like in other Marvel films, but not so much, like in Iron Man, or Deadpool, what you'd expect.
In any case, Venom is a great movie for watching in the cinema exactly 'coz of its marvelous graphics and action. And you'll for sure find something to like it for.",Venom
1839,timmiedejager,Awesome but long build up,8,23 October 2018,I think the movie builds up way to long to Eddie taking Venom but when he does oh man it is great!,Venom

1841,karmakarkunal,A fun joy ride where Tom Hardy is the driver,7,11 October 2018,"Venom is the first to come from the Sony Spiderverse, without Spider-Man. I am a comic book enthusiast and I love Spider-Man. What was intended to be an alternate suit for Spider-Man, turned out to be his one of the prominent nemesis. I was quite shocked to hear that this movie doesnt include anything about Spider-Man, not even a cameo or a mention. Still, since Venom is such a rich character, I was rooting for this movie and actually looked forward to it. 
The whole movie, the fun part of it, all credit goes to Tom Hardy. He is a talented actor, and he delivers. What I really enjoyed is the chemistry between Venom and Eddie Brock. The emotional turmoil, the voices, the comic relief. That's where the good part ends. The rest is a just a hotchpotch of the same countless comic book movies we have been watching. Also I really wanted this movie to be a R-rated. 
Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake is not convincing enough. He is talented as well, but the casting feels wrong. Same goes for Michelle Williams. The CGI could have been better, since it's coming from Sony. The soundtrack was good. 
I would recommend to watch this movie. It is different than the usual Marvel formula based movies.",Venom
1842,AwesomeCoolGuy,Could be better,3,6 October 2018,"Sony messed up, real bad. They took a fun concept and turned it bad. They messed up a real cool villain and made him unwatchable. Not that Tom Hardy, hell he was the best part of the movie! He was super believable and I felt for him. He's a TV reporter who get fired for raising questions yo the evil guy and than comes in contact with the symbiote. And than there's Michelle Williams, no character, terrible acting, basically around as a love interest because if you don't have one of those, movie=bad. And than the villain, oh boy, the worst of the worst. He runs a corporation called ""Life corp' (great name) and really loves the symbiotes. He'll do anything to get those symbiotes. And than he merges with a symbiote, and wants to go to space??? What? Who saw this coming? The third act comes out of no where and I only realized it was the third act half way through the big fight. Also the movie cant decide if Venom's bad or good, just pick one and stick with it.
I really wish that the movie went more in depth with Hardy's and Venom's relationship, because it's quite entertaining and fun, but just like the rest of the movie, it's rushed and glossed over and buried under other terrible scenes like:
Venom telling us what his weaknesses is
Hardy kissing the symbiote that is actually Williams (wait, what?)
So yeah the characters: not entertaining (except for Hardy)
Plot: rushed, already done better, and makes more sense
Villain: boring, motivations change at random
Camerawork and special effects: Not bad, actually quite good. The special effects are quite good at times.
But we all know what this movie lacked, a Spiderman. A voice of reason, and it would be quite fun for the final battle to be between them. So verdict: Wasted opportunities result in this loud rushed mess with a great performance from Tom Hardy",Venom
1843,weetomboii,Good movie- ignore the critics!,7,3 October 2018,"The movie was good! Won't say it's the best movie around and for a marvel film yes it's not quite as good as they other films they have established. But it's definitely very enjoyable!Tom Hardy was fantastic acting as always. Venom was badass, the action scenes were great and dynamic, shot very well too. The film takes a while to get into, but around half way it starts progressing really nicely. Humour here and there and a generally likeable cast! Obviously the film isn't perfect but critics have it wrong this time. The plot has a few weaknesses, the villian is kind of uncharismatic and it's a bit slow at times but otherwise a great entertaining watch, and definitely a far better big screen representation of Venom compared to Spiderman 3!",Venom

And to be honest neither do I that's why I'm writing this.Tom Hardy was hot. Venom was funny. It was action packed. Really the movie did mostly everything it was supposed to. Although there weren't any shirtless scenes. Only thing I didn't like about this movie was the runtime. They couldn't even try to get it to 2 hours. And not counting credits the movie is literally an hour and a half. It feels like it's running on a very tight schedule and you can tell that it was trimmed closely because there's nothing unnecessary. Even though sometimes that's what makes a movie more enjoyable. But other than the runtime and really the lack of flexibility in the editing room, I think this movie was a hit and honestly I'm sure that the box office will agree with me on that.",Venom

Tom Hardy seems perpetually drunk in the movie, like actually drunk - not like Johnny Depp hilariously ""drunk"" on pirates. Slurring his words and barely intelligible, relatable, or credible. Just bad acting. The score is awful, the editing supremely incompetent. The script is choppy and poorly sewn together.

I'm also a big fan of Tom Hardy, this therefore was a must see film, despite the fact that the reviews I had seen were not overly positive.Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock an investigative journalist who through his work become 'infected' by an alien symbiote called Venom. He then seeks to save the world.Whilst this film is not quite up the, admittedly high, standard of Dr Strange, Deadpool and Ant Man & the Wasp for me I really enjoyed it. Tom Hardy is up to his usual standard and there are some good action sequences. Eddies conversations with his Venom-self add a nice extra dimension to the character. All in all a must watch for Marvel, Super-Hero and comic fans. My partner and I did wonder if they should have taken Venom into the x-rated comedy zone occupied by Deadpool but it is no problem that they did not.Apparently Tom Hardy has signed up for 2 more Venom films - great news!

I don't get it what more do you want from action packed anti-hero movie like venom . Its filled with great action sequences and great acting. Final words excellent movie Really loved it,Venom
1860,mamunmd-07455,Criminally Underrated,9,5 June 2020,"I totally loved this movie and the 2nd part will be even better. I felt it is very underrated at IMDb, the story building was really good.

1863,Liam_x7,Delicious!,6,7 May 2019,I just watched this on Blu Ray and it was very good. The story itself is easy to follow and the action soon kicked off. Venom is a great character I could have done with another half hour of this movie all said and done.The action was what you would accept from a Marvel film it was very good it stood out its shot pretty much at night and this showed on Blu Ray the colour schemes looked great against Venoms black and white figure along with the explosions etcOverall a good watch and well worth a pick up on Blu Ray.,Venom
1864,sosamontrevor,Roller Coaster,5,2 January 2019,Venom is very much like a roller coaster. Act one is incredibly boring. Act two is stupid fun. Act three falls off of the rails and makes you regret ever getting on this crazy contraption to begin with.,Venom

The plot was great and it made me laugh.
I liked the part were the symbiote was the little girl that was slightly creepy lol.
Favorite part was the motorcycle scene.
I've watched a lot of movies and this is one of my favorites .
These critics keep down playing the good movies. Every movie I've liked has never followed through with a second. It saddens me that you critics think the stupid movies are great and the great are stupid .
I hope there will be a second one .",Venom

1867,djcpierotti,Ignore the Critics,9,24 February 2019,"Man, I love this movie. Critics have no idea what they are talking about. Only one problem: The movie itself takes too long to get moving, but once it does, WOW, it's awesome. Tom Hardy was great in this movie, and the interactions with Venom were really fun to watch. Overall, go see this movie, it is totally worth your time and attention.",Venom
1868,th-13775,It is not worth the time .,3,2 May 2019,It is really bad movie and the graphics also not that great and some scenes it should be funny but it is not even Tom Hardy not feeling it and the conversion between eddy and venom is bad comedy I'm sorry say it but it is not worth it .,Venom
1869,TIM-20,C-grade effort from Marvel.,4,29 June 2019,"I mean it kicks off well. But the more it goes on, the compelling ideas Venom sets up are abandoned. In it's place: a mostly CGI mess of a superhero movie.Venom never takes the time to flesh out the backstory of the abilities that take over Tom Hardy. So we're left with a super-powered creature that does all kind of stuff because it looks cool, I guess? It's kind of a parable of the working man vs. corporate America, it's kind of a buddy movie, it's kind of lots of superhero movies we know- Spiderman, Hulk, Deadpool, but mostly it's a messy plate of half-rendered ideas. And Hardy and the rest of a solid cast can't save it.",Venom

It is problematic at the beginning and seems like a superhero movie made in 2006 but as it progresses it makes for a better movie.
Not the best Tom Hardy movie there is, he seems to be trying too hard at some scenes but without a doubt his relationship with the symbiote is very charismatic.",Venom

1886,sabruu,Weird but in a good way,7,2 January 2021,"Yes it may not a masterpiece but it's entertaining and it's much better and funnier than half of other marvel movies without lots of unnecessary drama. It's an easy watch and even feels short, although I can see it may not be for everyone but it surely deserves an opportunity . Also tom hardy ad-libbing was probably the best part",Venom
1887,IsaiahWaard,This Film tried it's best...,6,1 October 2021,"Unfortunately it's really hard to tell a Venom origin story without the rights to Spider-Man, This film however, still makes an attempt, and due to that unfortunate fact this movie never could've been anything better than say a 7 out of ten, since the foundation is already cracked.This movie definitely does a lot of things right thought. Venom is both intimidating and somewhat comedic (as true to the comics). Eddie Brock looks like a terrible sweaty mess which is such a nice change of pace from Marvel shirtless male glamour shots. Also since we're talking about the positives Venom's voice actor and the CG they for Venom is just perfect, with the only issue to that statement being that venom doesn't have the symbol on his chest since he hasn't been bonded with Spider-Man yet.The only major downside (I feel) against this film are the absence of Spider-Man and the presence of a villain (Riot) that just feels like filler. Whenever Riot or the knock-off Oscorp CEO were on screen the film is significantly less interesting then when it's just Eddy and Venom. I glad that they made the relationship work between Eddy and Venom but the sequel is basically doomed to fail unless it's a reboot.",Venom

I went in having just seen the IGN review of 4.0 - The reviewer is a turd in the wind. Just don't listen to anyone. Go and see it. You will enjoy yourself.Okay so this is not Infinity War, Guardians or anything. BUT it's fun, it has it's amount of action and with it's length, it does not overstay it's welcome. This may not be a great movie, but it's good! and it certainly is better than a lot of critics will tell you.I have been very critical with movies this year. After the Last Jedi fiasco, I thought SOLO was okay but nothing more, on second viewing Deadpool 2 wasn't really that good, Jurassic World was.... well there and so on. I wasn't looking at my watch in this one, which I did in the other films I mentioned. If that tells you something. Like I said, go in with a clear mind and enjoy. You won't be disappointed.",Venom

The first 3rd drags on a little bit too much and your just sat waiting for him to become venom proper but other than that it's a great film with some good humour that isn't out of place and sits well in the whole tone and theme. Hopefully marvel and sony ignore the critics and make a 2nd!!,Venom

1900,PariahDog,Terrible,3,28 December 2018,"Besides its unimaginative story and conventional progression, it has moments that just cause shivers to run down your spine due to secondhand embarrassment. Unlike other Marvel titles, Sony is clearly restricted to spider-man and his supporting cast. For this title, however, they seemingly made the decision to remove Venom from any shared universe. As such, Venom's origin story is very far removed from its comic counterpart and despite having strong overlap with spider-man's design the movie makes no connection between them at all.A missed opportunity for Sony was to be the first to have a villain origin movie, which could easily culminate into a spider-man vs. venom movie where neither hero nor villain needs more than half of the movie's running time to get established. Instead, Venom is sort of a hero but edgier. As if you were watching a deadpool movie without humor.After all the nonsense stuff venom was saying and stupid decisions he was making, I finally called it quits when venom casually revealed he was a loser on his home planet (I almost quit when he just casually revealed his weaknesses to someone he hardly knew). In just a handful of seconds they established a (very poor) reason for Venom to become a good guy and it sucked.",Venom
1901,jimmybag,Sony still hasn't found a compatible host,2,5 October 2018,"Disclaimer: My most definite introduction and impression of Venom has been from the 90's Spider-man: TAS. I thought, it'd be a great, gritty anti-hero movie.After BvS and Suicide Squad I tempered my expectations, I expected nothing. Maybe I was in the closet, when it came to my expectations.It's an extremely generic action movie, it seems cool for a few minutes, has an Alien type of vibe when it starts, but as it rolls along nothing really unfolds much and maybe it doesn't really need to, because Eddie having the symbiote would be interesting enough. But the movie doesn't do anything with it. The ""edgy confrontational"" reporter from ""Nu-Yooock"" is what you get, which I guess was to be expected, judging by the trailers. And it just goes on as this sort of cartoonish buddy-cop flick.There is no interesting duality to the Eddie Brock/Venom character, it's not even that violent. It often feels like a boy and his dog flick, the symbiote spites Eddie in very generic comedic ways, helps fix his relationships, even starts to like other characters. There's nothing NOT banal or generic about Eddie, the villain and his plans, the symbiotes and ""their plan"". You can't even spoil this movie. You've seen it. Trust me.You saw the symbiote talking in the trailer and comparing how that was shown in the Spider-man:TAS, it just dawns on you how not subtle it is. It adds another layer of lame, the opposite of ""show, don't tell"". Couple of elements of blatant expositions here and there as well.If it were anymore toothless, thoughtless and generic, you'd probably have Eddie showing Venom a hip-hop song and then maybe at the end teach it to get jiggy or whatever.The SFX were cool. Venom looked cool, which is probably the solitary idea behind this project.",Venom

1904,KhaledKalache,Your friendly neighborhood Venom!,6,5 January 2019,"I watched this movie after i was going to watch Firstman, but it wasn't available, the first movie I watch in cinema in USA, what an experience!! good flick, if your a fan of Tom Hardy and Venom your gonna love it, or at least your not gonna hate it, the overusing of CGI always kills it for me when it comes to comicbook movies specially the main character, I was a bit disappointed when I watched the trailer but the movie overall have a good story, not that serious Which i liked, i think the PG-13 rating gave the movie limits to what they could've done, i wish i can see how Venom can eat heads fully and characters can say normal swear words not cheesy onse, the casting of Dr. Drake was NOT on point, and the finale with Eminem singing Venom was just EPIC!! The movie had 2 post credit scenes, it made good in the box office despite the bad reviews, so as far as Tom Hardy is in .. i think they will make a second one that will be better than this one .. specially with a good villain like Carnage .. and maybe a Spider Man appearance.",Venom

Terrible dialogue, none of the performances are believable (what's up with Tom Hardy's American accent? Awful...), some of the scenes were displayed so fast and the sections change so quickly, it is hard to see what's happening. The female characters are dull, with no interesting dialogue and terrible acting, plus cliche roles! The 'bad guy' is laughable, he is not threatening or convincing in the slightest, total miscast.

The plot-line is usual, with a loser coming across an enhancement, this time an alien creature who has come to infiltrate the planet, needs a symbiotic body to survive, and slowly starts to love the planet earth.The VFX are superb, and since I watched it in 3D 4DX version, felt myself participating in the action sequences and the fights. Tom Hardy is adorable, and the mid-credit has already revealed the next installment. Will wait impatiently for that too. Make sure to wait for the end-credits!",Venom

I thought it was great. For the record, I never read the graphic novel/comic book so I had no pre-conception of what it should be like. I liked the storyline and the plot development. It made perfect sense to me. I thought it was a very original take on a superhero. It is certainly one that I have not seen before nor have I seen anything remotely similar.

It's clear Hardy and the cast are trying their best but they don't have much to work with. That all being said, if you are a Marvel fan, you will enjoy it. Hopefully a sequel will be better.

1916,mako_reactor,Shameless attempt at a quick cash-grab,3,24 November 2018,"Are you kidding me with this sad attempt of a quick cash grab? One of the worst CGI I've seen in a movie ever, followed by one of the most pathetic ''villains'' in any movie ever. This was clearly made in a rush for a quick cash-grab, with a clear attempt to jump on that marvel bandwagon as many others are trying to do (and failing miserably)
I'm not against trying something new or taking another direction with these type of movies but this failed on SO many levels. The pacing was excruciating. The first 40 minutes or so is worthless filler garbage. And a good chunk of the action pure CGI cheesefest. Not decent CGI. Really bad cheesy CGI like what you see in the early 2000s movies like the Incredible Hulk. The villain is the definition of cliché and does absolutely nothing except fill a gap in the void of nonsense that is this so called movie. Shame on you Sony.",Venom

I'm thrilled to say the critics were dead wrong and I not only liked the movie, I laughed at the right time and got to know this complex hero.

1931,rcjones-377-210538,Better than Batman v Superman,8,5 October 2018,I thought it was very entertaining. Hardy was perfect.,Venom
1932,jwilce,Surprisingly good,7,14 October 2018,"I went in with very low expectations on the basis that it is not an MCU film and the character doesn't have an obvious plot arc to follow, given that Venom is generally evil and serves predominantly as a villain for Spiderman rather than a character in its own right.However, after the first slow 30-40 minutes which is pretty much exclusively exposition and relentless character development, we get Venom who is the star of the show. The combination of formal but conversational outbursts with the mock sinister voice is a comic gold mine, and the theatre I was in laughed at almost every line he said. Sadly, Tom Hardy's Venom was so good that he did somewhat upstage himself as Eddie Brock who I felt was a confused character with no clear defining qualities apart from making bad life choices and being quite friendly, whilst also running a successful news program and exposing extreme injustice - sound like anyone you know??? Me neither.Short story shorter, CGI fight was about as disappointing as you might imagine, first 30-40 mins is by and large pretty dull, but the second act makes it worth it for the Tom Hardy double act which will have you in tears. Enjoy!",Venom
1933,agarvis,Should have been R-rated,7,5 October 2018,"Big Venom fan.The Tom Hardy / Venom bromance was on point so much that I can't wait to re-watch those scenes over and over. The dark humor was great, if not toned down. Could have been much better had they taken a queue from Deadpool (cough cough R-rated). The plot however was useless and the first half of the movie setting up the cliche ""villian domesday plan"" was C+ at best. In fact the script was so bad and expository that I started to pretend that there were ""comic book speech bubbles"" as the characters delivered their lines. After doing so, the movie turned a foot and became quite good. It became a live action comic book that was all but missing the fun visual aids and cut scenes that Ruben Fleischer absolutely nailed in Zombieland. Overall good time but definitely lacking an edge. Hardy as Brock / Venom was unquestionably memorable. Loved the anti-hero bro dynamic and hope they make a DARKER, more outrageous sequel featuring 2 hours of straight-up buddy comedy. Would love to see the duo get loose at an underground poker night full of bad guys.Side note - 3D was pretty useless and CGI should have been better. Shame on you Sony.",Venom
1934,LeFebvreC,Not terrible but lacks a lot,4,23 December 2018,"If you're a fan of the Spider-Man comics you know where Venom came from (it wasn't as portrayed in this movie) and Eddie Brock was motivated for many years solely by his hate for Spider-Man ruining his career and the Venom symbiotes hate for Spider-Man for rejecting it. (Yes, Venom was Peter Parker's black Spider-Man suite in the comics). The reason I feel this movie is not great is mainly because it rewrites the history of Venom and how he came to be and completely removes Spider-Man.I've liked Tom Hardy in many of his movies but here his acting is all over the place where he's mumbling his lines like he's deranged or when he's talking to his ex girl friend it's like he's got an IQ of 60 and it's also partially his demeanor like he's a 16 year old sorry for something wrong he did.The film also seems disjointed and I read that 40 minutes of scenes were deleted (including some of Tom Hardy's favorite) and that may explain that this film was badly edited and perhaps some critical scenes that would have made the movie better were removed.",Venom
1935,burakuysaler,Could be better,5,6 October 2018,"Replics, acting did not catch me. Effects were good. Could not see the details and moves, and could not understand who was who during the fight between Venom and Riot. Would expect better for a Marvel story.",Venom
1936,jaytheguvna,Good but not amazing,6,18 November 2018,"First things first, the movie was good. Not great mind you, just good. Tom Hardy did a good job as Eddie Brock. As the central character, the story pretty much followed events predominantly from his point of view. You occasionally got a glimpse of others but not nearly enough.The other major character was Venom, one of a band of aliens that have been brought to earth. The dialog between hardy and Venom was quite entertaining, especially during and the run up to action scenes. This in itself made the movie worthwhile.The story, for me, was very predictable. I suppose what I'm saying is, it was a very lazy script. That doesn't mean I hated it, but i would have expected some more substance over spice.The effects were awesome and you could see that plenty of money had be thrown into them. As you would expect from a high end movie from Marvel. The publicity in the run up kind of shows what to expect.Conclusion: The film was a good one. I would have liked a little less predictability and more depth to supporting characters. The script could have been a lot better but if you're looking for action, special effects and a few laughs, then this won't disappoint. Overall, even though I've listed a few downfalls, I would certainly watch it again in the future. The movie is certainly not terrible and deserves to do well. If you get the chance, go and see it. I give it a thumbs up.",Venom

1938,imCK3000,Cliché of clichés,3,16 December 2018,"Weak plot with no direction. Tom Hardy looked unguided. The pretentious voice is highly unnecessary. Horrible CGI, felt like I'm watching The Terminator from 3 decades ago",Venom
1939,joelshyrock,AMAZING!!!!!!!,10,12 October 2018,"When I went to go see this movie, I had an open mind about how they were going to make this movie, without Spider-Man being the main Origin. I have to say, they did a pretty amazing job with this movie. The action was awesome, the story was good, and the character development was spot on.",Venom
1940,H-TANVEER,A fun to watch Movie,7,11 November 2019,"Before the start of the movie my expectation from venom was to be an action packed R-rated comprising lots of of blood and heinous murder scenes with a very depressing story line. After watching the film i found this movie to be funny than anything else.Plot of the movie is like any average cliche action film story . Lots of questions to be asked on the execution of the story but i guess action movies usually get away with stuff like logic behind every action. The bond between venom and eddie was very adorable. Some of the dialogues between them were really really funny and it really made my day. Anne and Eddie relationship was annoying to say the least.In acting department only Tom Hardy is worthy enough to be mentioned. He as usual lived up to his name with his sleek, calm and impeccable expressions and dialogues. Rest of the cast is disappointing to say the least and i wouldn't waste my and yours time to mention those lowly creatures.In short, if you are looking for a fun movie with lots action scenes and want to spend a happy time with your friends or partner than Venom is your answer.",Venom
1941,singfenchen,Low expectations were largely met,6,4 October 2018,"It was an okay movie. The CGI was a bit ropey in places. I like the 'Lethal Protector'-inspired story, but the execution felt ""off"". Tom Hardy was great - super actor - and I haven't been disappointed with his portrayal in any role I've seen him in, and this was no different, but it missed the mark for me. Difficult to do Venom real justice without Spidey - sorry.",Venom

Someone using their imagination to put their own spin on the way they want to tell the story! Now as far as the movie goes the action, special effects and yes even the story.

Tom Hardy is excellent, the CGi is good, there are some great action scenes and the story is fine.I understand why some people are not happy that they downgraded it to a PG13 instead of R rating but at least I can watch it with my kid like the rest of the Marvel movies.",Venom
1946,domlevey05,Not bad,6,5 December 2018,"This is not a bad movie. It is a little bit funny, I wouldn't say it was overly funny. I didn't really belly laugh, but there was a small chuckle once or twice. I heard somewhere it was abit of a throwback to 90s movies, I would agree with this statement. It reminded me of Men In Black. It was actually quite fun, but if you're expecting like a Marvel movie, this isn't one. Yeh quite refreshing, turn your brain off watch. Doesn't take itself too seriously. Watch it if you like 90s movies, and TV shows, which I kind of do.",Venom
1947,epicgroobi55,DON'T believe the hate. great movie with a lot of heart.,8,4 October 2018,"Firstly, this movie has CHARACTER, plain and simple.
Secondly, Its NOT a marvel cinematic universe movie, and it doesn't try to be.
Tom hardy did an amazing job and its his most unique performance till this date. it has heart, and amazingly written characters who you can relate to without even noticing it, yes even Venom it self.
on the bad note the CGI could have been done better.
also the pg 13 rating does feel like a factor in the action sequences, but the movie it self is a lot lighter and humorous than the trailers show, there for it doesn't feel like you were robbed from a blood shed head decapitating rampage logan style.
in conclusion, this movie is a lot of fun, a must watch for every action\comedy\superhero fan.",Venom

 First the good
1. The look of Venom is great! His voice is also great!
2. The banter between Eddy and Venom.
3. Venom has an interesting personality!
4. Visual effects were decent.The Bad 
1. Tons of plot holes! It felt like an hour was missing from thr movie. 
2. Michelle Williams character is quite dumb or just really dosnt care she just seen a giant monster. She basically was phoning it in.
3. it being PG13 felt very watered down and a potential for a great adult story could of happened.
4. The villian was just plain and boring.
5. No spiderman.
6. The pacing was up and down, first half was very slow and thr 2nd half was rushed. 
7. The soundtrack was absolutely atrocious! Auto tune rap? Really? No one likes that garbage! Specially in a movie about an alien. Its not save the last dance.
8. The bike chase scene was very very cheesy.
9. Cringe worthy acting.
10. You didnt really feel for the main characters, not even Eddy brock. Iuno. This movie is a 4/10. Anyone saying its amazing is probably someone who loved Suicide Squad. Don't listen to them.",Venom

1951,pro-vinyl-concepts,It was a great movie,9,19 October 2018,"I have no idea what critics were watching!!! I further state that any professional critic should be banned from writing reviews of comic book films. When they can say that Black Panther was the greatest comic movie ever and give poor reviews of Venom. That speaks for itself. This movie is funny, entertaining, and Hardy does a great job establishing a likable character. I am extremely excited to hear that Hardy has signed on for more in title role and as producer.The end credit scene with Woody Harrelson as Carnage only adds to the excitement, as a fan of the comic, for the next installment. It definitely needs to have an ""R"" rating!!!!",Venom

1954,madsdinesen4,"Great concept, bad execution",4,8 November 2018,"This movie could have been much more but lacks quality on all levels. The plot is predictable to some extend and just doesnt feel complete. The acting, except Tom Hardy, is bad mainly because of the manuscript and the cheesy, soap-opera, reality-show vibes.

1956,bruvicbru,This Venom should be added to the MCU.,9,7 October 2018,"Don't listen to the critics, go and enjoy the movie. This version of Venom and its origin story work beautifully without a Spider-man, yet I believe it should be added later in the future. The only reason why I didn't give it a perfect ten is because I wanted to see more of Venom, even though it got more than enough screen time. I loved it, I will probably watch this film at least two more times, and I really REALLY hope Disney makes a smart move and adds this Venom to the MCU. It has great potential, and would fit right in with Tom Holland's Spider-man. That would be all for today.",Venom

The interaction between Brock and Venom was hilarious, and Tom Hardy is just, amazing.So, if you're hesitate to watch because of the horrible reviews, don't, we watch movies to have fun, not to try to find the mistakes the paid reviews says.

1962,gavinmorehead13,Very disappointing,4,9 October 2018,"When I first heard of venom movie was being made starring Tom Hardy I was want to percent on board so excited. When I finally went to go see it and was super excited, then 50 minutes went by and still no venom. The movie just feels like a giant build up that that doesn't lead anywhere. I felt like it was a drama about a journalist that's trying to do right, instead of a super villain that eats people and does whatever he pleases.  I really did not enjoy the sass that venom gave Eddie Brock throughout the film when they did show him. It was so annoying I just Wanted the movie to end right there. I get his superhero movies need to make a few jokes but these weren't that good for cringy and just no thank you. Don't really understand why Vemon choose to save the earth instead of continueing to destroy it. That doesn't make any sense to me at all he even gives a reason why he chooses to do you good and that didn't make sense. Because of Eddie Brock after he wanted to eat them. Even though he's a villain in the comic books it just bothers me, he's not an antihero he straight up a super villain that gets threatened by other villains or superheroes.  Only thing I liked was the special effects and Tom Hardy. I have to admit I will always stand by Tom Hardy. He's such a talented and magnificent actor. 4/10",Venom
1963,laurent-dezamy,I didn't expect much but the very weak plot made it boring anyway!,4,6 October 2018,"Acting so so (I didn't find Tom Hardy funny, didn't really get the interest of the Ann character, the villain is not scary!) Special effects not fantastic but OK.The weakest point is the forced, over cliche plot!

1969,jus-rodk11,Just needs to be Rated R.,8,8 October 2018,"First and foremost, with a name like 'Venom' it should be an automatic. Now I'm coming out of the theatre, and I have to say that characters usages and also their personalities made this even more enjoyable for me. You see Eddie Brock as this arrogantly confident guy, who turns out to be sorta selfish and then is infected with something he knows of, but really does not know its capabilities. Once he starts to interact with the abilities he becomes situationally scared. In retrospect you have the LyfeFoundation dude, who believes in being better than what he believes the human species is. Throughout the movie he is trying to understand what he has found. By humanities standards, he is very cruel and ruthless with his methods. Scientifically, he would be considered groundbreaking by many. A life-form that can use a human as a host, heal the host (or kill the host), and communicate mentally and as an outside form. HmmmmAlso, this is the first time I can remember seeing the hero/anti-hero being 2 separate things that work together as one. Most super hero's are either alien themselves, something crazy made them that way, born with their superpowers. Venom is a living species that talks to Eddie through the film. So yea, I may have went on a text rant, but hey, at least you read it. Venom is a great movie, needs an R-Rated version. *Line of the Film: when the organism dies and Carlton Drake gets upset with his set and says ""How could you just stand there and let the superior species die; how selfish!""",Venom
1970,ctrygalk,I agree with the critics,5,25 November 2018,"Unfortunately I have to agree with the critics. First off it was soooooooo slow moving. Yes some of the effects were creative and there were some moments of humor i enjoyed. But as a whole it was mediocre at best. Tom Hardy is way too masculine for this part. Seriously he whines?!!
My hopes are now that it's been established the second movie can move on from this long drawn out introduction.",Venom

1973,agustinlopez20,Tom Hardy Acting SUCKS! - No passion he is just a mercenarie getting paid!,3,5 October 2018,"This movie is a complete mess, in fact the trailer is better than the entire movie, only good scenes at the ones in the trailer apart from that the entire movie revolves in Tom Hardy trying to act but instead of acting it makes you sleepy, in fact Venom could be a good replacement for the strongest sleeping pill ever.I am very upset because of this poor cast and director that made a horrible movie the future of an amazing marvel character as Venom is almost doomed and most likely we will not see any other sequel, they had something amazing and they blew it. First issue is the actor Tom Hardy does not have a clue about comic books 0 he does not care mainly he did it for his son and money so starting there you have an actor with 0 passion and that is not giving anything for this movie to be successful, rest of the cast is non existent, CGI is the worst ever, the director have to be demoted to direct 2 minutes shorts in you tube.Last but not least they blew it again by not doing an R rated movie! Venom should be different to anyone else but the only thing they did was to do a very bad copy of a super hero movie from the '90. Don't watch the movie or you will feel sick from all the Venom a bad move like this has.",Venom

1975,tasosts19,I ignored the critics and it was actually really good!!!,7,10 October 2018,"I just watched the movie and i can't understand why it received so bad reviews.
It wasn't boring at any time and very fun to watch from the beggining to the end.
Also Tom Hardy feels like a perfect match to the role and does a fantastic job.
The only negatives i can find are that some dialogues seem a little too simple and rushed and the battle between venom and riot have bad cgi and doesn't look very good.
In conclusion one thing that bothers me in most of marvel movies is that every line has to contain a cringy stupid joke and like 1/10 jokes are actually good enough. In venom there aren't too many jokes but they are very amusing and really make the movie better!!",Venom
1976,triplex23,Great Start!!,9,16 October 2018,"Great Start to what will hopefully be a series of movies. Good action and a good story. I really loved every minute of the movie.

1979,jacqueline-clarke,Venom take me away....,9,2 February 2019,"I sat down to this movie with the rumors of terrible reviews in my head, but screw that. Venom ate someone in a trailer. That's all I needed.Venom is direct and straight to the point. It builds up a little background, just enough to give some weight to what is to come. But it's enough. I don't need Eddie Brock's childhood story, or to see him getting his first journalist job. Irrelevant. Eddie is shown as a maverick journalist, who will do what he has to for the truth. That's honestly all we need to know. This is an action movie about aliens and humans morphing into one.It was quick paced, brought in secondary characters and let them go as needed, with just as much as we needed.We showed up for Venom wrecking carnage and eating people. To him being an antihero. And for him and Eddie to be bros as they had some violent good times. I got exactly what I paid for.Tom Hardy delivered, the effects were great and didn't take me out of the movie once with any awkwardness. I was a little put off with Hardy's and Michelle Williams' chemistry. Both were fantastic, so I will chalk that up to me not feeling it. But ... who cares?The real romance was between Eddie and Venom, and that chemistry was real and palpable. A true love story.Get the origin stories of other Marvel films out of your mind, cleanse that palette for this. This movie is rougher, darker and obviously more violent. Doesn't make it better or worse, just different. This movie knew what it wanted to be and grew up to be it.Nine stars for being awesome ... minus one star for no knowledge currently of a sequel.",Venom
1980,hamzafer3,Great but not as dark as expected,8,21 October 2018,"Tom hardy put on an amazing performance. But the theme should be more dark as the movie is based on being a 'loser'.

1982,pdubs98,"Enjoyable, action-packed, and surprisingly funny comic book movie",7,6 October 2018,"Overall, Venom was an overall enjoyable film. The acting from Tom Hardy is fantastic. He plays the awkwardly talking Eddie Brock very well and his and Venom's chemistry is priceless and sometimes hilarioud. And the action scenes with them are very well done. However, the villian of the movie is complete trash. He talks like a preacher and his dialogue is sometimes cringeworthy. The acting from Elisabeth Williams is a little underplayed, but not to the point that it's unwatchable. And some other scenes can play out a little awkwardly, but the saving grace of the movie is Tom Hardy. If you just want a comic book movie that's not great but good and that's different from the others this will please you. I'm glad I saw it and I wouldn't mind seeing it again in the future.",Venom

I myself never read comics and loved the movie... it was funny and lots of action..",Venom
1987,jratkizzle,It was bad but still somehow somewhat enjoyable,4,8 October 2018,"I feel like this page needs an honest review because it has so many 10/10's or even 8/10 and the movie is not worth that by miles!The first half was so cliché I debated leaving or napping. I thought the acting was poor on all accounts and for some reason it seemed like Tom Hardy was walking with a stick up his behind, with a weird limp, before anything physical ever happened to him. The only character I felt was entertaining and enjoyable was Venom but even his motivations were confusing *spoiler* like when he suddenly wanted to be a ""good guy"" because Eddie somehow changes his views, even though Eddie didn't seem to do anything amiable to change his ways. All that aside I'm not disappointed I saw it. We probably would have waited for it to come to Nerflix if we weren't new parents and looking for an excuse to get out of the house for a few hours sans baby. Also, my fiance thought this Venom was the one with Carnage because we didn't watch any previews. It had a couple funny moments and the second half was far better than the first half. My advice is to go on a night your theater has cheap tickets or wait till it comes out on Redbox. It's just okay.",Venom
1988,vfromvagancy-34662,I don't see from where is all the hate coming from.,10,5 October 2018,"I had a blast watching this movie, and everyone else in the theater also seemed to be enjoying it.I'll start mentioning what this movie did right:First, this movie is really, really, funny. They injected a lot of humor, and it lands. The whole theater was laughing, and all the humor helps making the public go onboard with all the darkness this movie has. I mean, our protagonist is infected with a monster that likes eating heads of living things.Second, similarly to the Alien movies, they do right by not having actual Venom too much time on screen. That way when it is, it's kinda terrifying keeping you on edge.Third, Tom Hardy does Venom and Eddy Brock, and he does this really great. The chemistry between Eddy and Venom is the best part of the whole movie.Final positive notes, CGI, specially Venom, generally looks great. Pacing is really good. The movie is around 2 hours long, and you don't feel the time pass. Actions scenes are pretty good as well. Many people complain about the climatic ending being a CGI-fest, but what the hell were you expecting when you signed up to see a movie about giant alien monsters?Negatives, the rest is pretty mediocre. The story is pretty much there just to get the movie going, and it does that alright. Support characters had almost no development. The villain is pretty generic, although, I was pleasantly surprised to see them take some different directions to the ones they usual take on the generic villain. They could've gone further with this concept like Deadpool did, and I really hope they do in the future.This movie is more funny than many comedies, has decent action, and good looking CGI. Totally recommended.",Venom
1989,tobiasplasschaert,Don't listen to the critics!,7,1 December 2018,"You can write long essays about how good or how bad a movie is, but for me it always comes down to one thing: did I enjoy the movie? And you know what, yes, I enjoyed it a lot!This movie is made for one thing only, to serve the fans. It isn't part of the MCU or any other big set-up. It doesn't need to bring up millions in merchandise, it doesn't need to build an entire new universe or timeline. It's just for the fans to enjoy.We get simple storyline that is easy to follow. CGI isn't always perfect but holy cow, how good does Venom look? Tom Hardy is hilarious, his acting is good and the voice work is superb! The other characters are forgettable yes, but it doesn't matter to the story.
Cinematographly speaking it's not a impressive movie like for example Nolan's trilogy but it's good.The only ""problem"" I have with the story is the quick turn of Venom, his arc is rushed but that's because (in my opinion) this is just a standalone movie. I don't think there will be a second one. But if there is, count me in!The conclusion is that this is just a simple fun movie, people expecting a magnificent movie shouldn't buy a ticket. People who just want to relax and see a funny movie about symbiotes should definitely buy a ticket!",Venom
1990,heythisisgushello,Don't listen to the critics!,8,7 October 2018,"Venom is overall a solid flick, and in my opinion a lot better than most MCU origin movies. That being said, the movie is not perfect and feels like it could be fleshed out more. This is probably due to the studio wanting to play it safe, and I feel because of that if this movie does well enough the sequel will be even better! I'd say this movie is definitely worth a watch, make your opinion about it.",Venom
1991,lady_dresden,Awesome!,8,7 October 2018,"I loved this movie! Great effects, I think it's a freaking fantastic movie! Yay Mr. Hardy I'm glad you did this movie, venom is great and I recommend this movie! 🖤🖤",Venom
1992,tell_je,Amazing despite what mainstream reviewers say...,10,5 October 2018,Watched the movie last night and it was amazing!!! I don't know what the mainstream reviewers are saying... They've literally been turning away normal marvel movie viewers from watching this movie over those bad reviews.,Venom
1993,tell_je,This is a great movie and mainstream media is trying to take it down!,10,5 October 2018,"I came into this movie expecting the movie too be less than decent because of mainstream media but it actually was awesome!

1994,randy-53412,Much better than reviewed.,9,20 December 2018,Not sure why the hate for this movie! Great introduction to a well loved character. Interactions between Brock and Venom are hilarious and looking forward to more!,Venom
1995,joshmatocha,Almost laughable,1,8 February 2019,I'll be short and too the point. The plot was a joke. Tom Hardy overacted the entire time. Michelle Williams was given awful lines and actions. Too much funny content for a dark anti hero. Riz ahmed is just your classic villain. Nothing really woes so funny and I laughed at parts I shouldn't of. Overall don't watch,Venom
1996,elijahbatz,REALLY BAD,1,8 October 2018,I really hated this movie. 1/10 for me honestly. I would much rather watch the Amazing Spider-man 2 again AND I HATE THAT MOVIE! The plot of this film was like a bad TV pilot. The film was just 2 hours of cringe . How are Venom fans not disappointed by this film? It doesn't do justice toward the character because it's bodged down with some of the most lazy writing I have ever seen . I usually disagree with the critics toward Superhero movies but this time I have to side with them. My friends and I made fun of this piece of crap during and after the movie. This film also would've benefited a tiny bit with an R rating but a complete rewrite of the film would have helped it the most. The editing was really choppy and the first 15 minutes are embarrassing. It's one of the worst superhero films I've ever watched. I wasn't even expecting much and I was disappointed. I really regret seeing this in theaters because the more money this makes the more Sony is going to put out garbage content like this. Heck I saw this on a matinee and I feel cheated. I could have bought a $5 blu-ray and watched something good with my friends. I could have rented a movie for $3 and bought off brand soda. But I made a bad decision by going to this film and handing the man on the counter $5. I'm never gonna see my money again because Venom consumed it and my stupid brain let it happen.,Venom
1997,mjabeir,Literally made me throw up,7,6 October 2018,"So here's the deal. This movie was a great time. Tom Hardy once again proved his worth as an actor with a borderline over the top performance. His ability to connect with venom was amazing. While the movie had the traditional villain premise, I was still sucked into the story and the stakes.
The intensity of the action sequences is where my story begins. I saw this movie in IMAX 3-D and the sound was so loud and the images were non stop cuts from one death to another that it triggered my motion sickness and I threw up in the hallway of the theater. Overall this movie fulfilled every expectation I had going into it. From a bland female character who had little to do and scenes that would've been perfect had they pushed for the R rating, this movie was exactly what I would define as adequate. Nothing particularly stuck out to me as innovative but I still had a good time watching this (mostly due to Tom's amazing performance). I just wish that if they were going down the route of dark, that they would've gone all the way. Marvel/Sony could've had their own Deadpool but I guess I can settle for a less funny, darker PG-13 version.",Venom
1998,darkhawk-97613,"Hollywood needs to start listening to the public, not critics",9,17 January 2019,"This movie was great! Lots of fun without garbage filler trying to please everyone or explain the jokes. Tom Hardy is fantastic and Venom is hilariously relatable even tho he is a CGI alien blob! Perfect villain (both human and alien), perfect love interest (both human and alien!) and great community of characters who you feel at least a little bit invested in!RIP Stan Lee, great to see you again one last time!",Venom
1999,morespam-29950,"Don't trust the critics, a really solid movie!",8,2 November 2018,"Sometimes I don't get the critics and after watching this movie, I feel I need to defend its' rating! :P it's a really good action packed film with all the perks of being made in association with marvel. Not a classic ""avenger-like"" story, great acting, really well delivered story. If you're looking for a movie to chill to, look no further.",Venom

Totally enjoyed it.",Venom
2001,dangibbs-66702,"Good film with a few problems, overall enjoyable flick.",7,15 October 2018,"Venom is one of the most iconic villains in the history of Marvel, after an unfaithful representation of the character in Spider-Man 3 (2007) it was decided by Sony to give Venom his own film. It was worth the wait of eleven years as the character has been redeemed.Tom Hardy is hard not to like, he is a wonderful talent and his accent was amazing! His performance was amazing, Mr Hardy had to portray a difficult role that any actor would struggle to perform. Acting as two different characters in the same scene is very hard and was worth the practice as the outcome was amazing.Although this film is not officially part of the MCU it has been said by both Sony and Marvel Entertainment that he will crossover with Spider-Man at some point. This will be a very anticipated film when announced as the last time we saw this battle was eleven years ago.The acting in the film was very good but I had one problem with the film, I realised that Eddie and most of the city are unaware of aliens. If this film is meant to be close to the MCU then how can it be possible if no one knows that aliens exist after the events of Avengers Assemble (2012).One other small problem I had with the film was how rushed the first act was and the character development was not as good as it could have been. After we see Venom connect to Eddie it improved but the first act was still a problem, in my opinion.Overall I would recommend seeing this film but do not expect a perfect superhero film.",Venom
2002,gowmitch,Watchable,7,3 October 2018,"As anti hero movies go this isn't too bad, gives a new look to venom i wasn't expecting, doesn't take too long to get to Its point, which makes it's run time go by pretty quick with very little drag, however the plot is easy to work out what is going to happen, but still makes a enjoyable watch",Venom
2003,recoorcholis,From the point of view of the fan,8,5 October 2018,"Venom as we know it the fans of the comic is a villain and Anti-Hero of the universe of Spider-Man. Venom as it is good and enjoyable but it is not the film nor the first time

2005,Mohamed-cazorla,what next?,4,5 October 2018,"It's good but we need to make a movie for every single comic book character. There are characters that can't appear alone as maybe venom? what was the idea of the movie from the first place? the movie started slow and started to build a story in the first half and it was like a romantic movie. the directing was too bad and the sreen was too dark that i couldn't see a thing. the second half was too rushed and villian appeared for too short time and was too bad not evil or strong enough as they said he didn't take it's time. ""venom"" turned good easily without any responsible reason it was too silly like a childish animation movie. i liked many things as of course tom hardy some scences but the characters and the directing and the sstory wasn't good enough didn't like it. i don't think venom could be without spider man",Venom
2006,alvarezjulio-73789,Don't believe the hate,8,5 October 2018,"I absolutely enjoyed this movie. And I definitely hope that they get to make a sequel.There was so much hate for this film. Before the movie dropped. I was in the theater, surrounded by $#!+ talkers. And by the end they were on board. And the after credit scene was good. Venom wasn't rated M for Mature as a comic, it definitely doesn't need to be rated R. The film isn't perfect, but it was entertaining. It's better than the incredible hulk and ironman 3. Its also better than the fantastic four movies. Tom Hardy is Eddie Brock. The last venom on screen was portrayed by Topher Grace, so.... Go see the film. Support your comic book inspired films. There was a time where superhero films were awful (Steel)",Venom
2007,stefhavermans,Weak script leads to a weak performance,4,22 December 2018,"The movie had me connected from the start, but turned into what I dreaded it would. The venom stories are dark, gritty and gore. This movie cares way to much about its ratings. Its just cheerfully, way too upbeat and easy to watch. It feels like it was targeted for a very young audience.The conversations are weak, and the overal plot is paper thin. The bad guy is known right from the start and a child could predict every step the movie is going to make.Originality was thrown out the window, when we got just another explosion crazy, cliché, children's movie. Marvel has become predictable. This was a waste of my time. I would not recommend this to anyone in general, but if i had to I would advise it if your 14 or a big Marvel fanboy.",Venom

2017,codimuppets-35884,We Are Venom,7,7 October 2018,"First things first. Critics are idiots that don't appreciate mainstream media and don't know how to enjoy a movie for what it is. Now that's out of the way, let's begin the review.Tom Hardy was FANTASTIC. The way he spoke, walked, acted and facial gestures was so, so good. And that's just him as Eddie Brock. Hardy as Venom was extremely awesome and exciting. Tom Hardy played the character extremely well and is exactly like the character from the comics. It's as if the director ripped the character from the comic page and plopped it on the screen.The movie itself was hilarious. Eddies and Venoms banter between eachother was really well done and would love to see more of it. Most of the jokes did land for me which is a win win. Mainly the dark humour of Venom and Tom Hardy's Incredible performance kept this film alive.I would also like to say the CGI was Outstanding. The way the symbiyote transformed round Tom Hardy was so well done and a pleasure to see on screen every time it happened. Another positive about the movie was the action. Some of the action was the best action I've seen in a superhero movie. And that's saying something.One grudge I would have on the movie though is the final battle between Venom and Riot. It's not very exciting or climatic. It just looks like two blobs of ink flying at eachother. You can't really distinguish them apart. Other than that, the action was spot on.I thought Riz Almend as the villain was great and creepy. I think maybe it would have been better if the final battle was so short though. The story also went in too quickly and didn't make much sense but other than that the story played together nicely and I don't think this Venom-Verse needs Spider-Man at all.One last thing I would like to say is stick around for the credits. The are two cracked after credits scenes that get me really excited for the sequel and future Venom-Verse Projects.Definitely go out and See Venom Now!!!!",Venom
2018,mathewtrucker,Ignore the movie critics,8,6 October 2018,There are many bad reviews for this movie but I have to say it's really good!! Had a few laughs too!! If only they went for the R rating.. nevermind..,Venom

2021,eashanvad,Throughly enjoyable!,9,4 October 2018,"Venom was throughly enjoyable, I'm not one to hate on critics, but this time I'm honestly not sure what they're on about, had pacing issues but Tom was great (obviously), the action was intense and the story was decent enough.

Hardy is TOP - what an awesome performance by him. Stylistically this film is great, visuals are stunning and design is cool.
And most importantly it feels like a coherent film!
The only drawback is the main antagonist and the final act which feels rashed. Extra half an hour would really help this movie!",Venom

2027,utopiano,The most uninspired Movie I've ever seen as Marvel product.,5,12 December 2018,"The story flys fast, characters flying fast, there is no certain background what happened when something happened. It's seems like a low budget movie.Tom Hardy trying hard to get rid of it his other characters in previous movies such as ""Bane"" and other important roles. He does a good job though.But the other characters are not as succesful like mr. Hardy. I don't understand that whats the point of the ""Carlton Drake"" character. He doesn't explaing what he trying to do exactly. What was the moral of ""Dr. Dora Skirth""? A lot of important dialogues of the movie just cutting short and we moving forward to another action scene.After all it's fun to watch but do not expect more.",Venom

2029,ryandalusung,Spoiler-free Review: Great Popcorn Fun,7,5 October 2018,"I just saw it. Don't let what many of the critics tell you ruin your experience. Although I wouldn't say this movie was a great film, I had an absolute blast watching it from start to finish. It's incredibly cheesy and the dialogue sometimes made me shake my head in embarrassment, but it's just great fun, and you can tell Tom Hardy had a blast with the role. He carries this film, and his joy in the role is certainly contagious. I thought several times between his interactions with... well, himself... that I would absolutely love to see a sequel happen. Tonally, it's a lot less dark and serious as the initial advertising and, frankly, the character of Venom himself makes the film look... Instead, it's cheesy and, by the end, somewhat endearing: Brock/Venom are definitely not wholesome characters, but you do come to root for them in their quests to become less ""UNwholesome"". This is definitely ""anti-hero"" Venom and not so much a typical ""monster-like"" character.Additionally, I think the film would have received a lot less ire from critics had it been released around the same era of comic book films as the first Blade film. Venom (the character) is great to watch and the first time he appeared on screen, I actually said to myself, ""hell yeah!"" He's very reminiscent of, for those who have played it, the Venom from the Spider-Man game for the PlayStation 1 back in 2000. If you enjoyed that rendition, I think you'll enjoy this big cinematic update.",Venom

2037,aldana_jennifer,SO GOOD!,8,6 October 2018,"I personally really liked this movie. I thought it was funny, fun, great action scenes, and as a person who loves to see a good CGI fight, it definitely fulfilled satisfaction. Tom Hardy is wonderful in anything he does so there are no complaints from me. Even the soundtrack is great! They got Eminem to do the main song which is really the cherry on top. And I've seen how people say it's too fast paced and has no back story but honestly I liked how it got to the point and didn't drag on. People also should remember that Venom is supposed to be a trilogy, so I'm sure they'll have plenty of time to fill in those empty holes where you might end up with questions. All in all, it's a great movie. My suggestion, grab some popcorn and take your whole family to the theaters and go watch Venom!!!",Venom
2038,liam_glass,Venom vs venom,4,25 November 2018,"The film seemed to struggle what type of movie it wants to be from comedy, action or very much taking itself serious. The performance of venom is great definitely one of the most entertaining thing in the film, like most films there's the start the middle and then end and it felt like the middle was shortened down or even skipped over.Venom and eddies bond was very much glossed over and rushed, background story to venom is blah then eddies story arc is here, there and everywhere then all of a sudden no where and there it is again.Does a marvel/sony non spiderman world work um.... in a way yes and this film proved it but without Spider-Man there is no point in venom.

Woody Harrelsons brief after credit scene stole the show fantastic.",Venom

First of all special effects: awesome!
Then there's Tom Hardy and honestly that man is just so watchable, great performance, great plot, loved everything, couldn't get enough of it. Left the cinema with a smile on my face,intrigued for the rest of the evening.
Can't wait for the sequel and more of Tom Hardy.",Venom

2050,james_mayer,THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!,10,21 October 2018,"I just watched Venom tonight and OMG it was so amazing! A lot of action, intense scenes, and a lot of suspenseful moments. We don't see Venom until a while into the movie, but the build up was totally worth it! There are a few scenes where viewer discretion is advised, but it isn't that bad. There are a few curse words in the film, but nothing too bad. Not that scary at all, there are a few parts in the film where it gets a little intense, but nothing out of the ordinary. Also for those who have not watched the film yet, there is a scene after the credits, and its a pretty important scene. I really loved this movie and everything about it. It was a 10/10 in my opinion. I would definitely recommend for you to go see it. Not too graphic or scary, and not too plain and boring. Please see it because it is amazing!",Venom
2051,jianamata,50% of the movie is boring and a bit unecessary,8,5 October 2018,"Though I do love the cast and especially the edgy character, Venom, the problem I have with the film is that it wasted pretty much half of its time with numerous unnecessary scenes instead of focusing on the story arc of the actual superhero character Venom (which we were all waiting for) and villain in the movie. Which is why I came out of the movie scratching my head thinking that it lacked a bit of more action sequences and character development between Venom and Symbiote. But overall, the movie is actually a decent super hero movie and I look forward that this isn't the last time we'll see Venom in the big screen.",Venom
2052,hockeyholl,Star Performances make it a really good Bad Movie,4,6 October 2018,"Let's be 100% honest. Venom isn't a good movie. It suffers from a bad script and a rushed plot, jamming as much detail into Venom's origin story as possible, but ultimately taking away from the power any one scene could have had. What Venom does have is star performances (Tom Hardy getting a Best Actor Nomination at the Golden Globes could definitely happen). Hardy, Michelle Williams, and Riz Ahmed are phenomenal on screen and they 100% make this movie into a really good, entertaining Bad Movie. It's worth watching. It's so bad that it's laughable, but it has some genuinely funny moments. The Eddie/Venom dynamic is fun to watch and again, brilliantly acted. 
But I wouldn't expect a sequel anytime soon.",Venom
2053,joshsegismundo,For Middle-Schoolers,3,25 October 2018,"A cringy movie... Venom isn't a menacing or cool character, but like some kind of Shrek, idk... Seems like Tom Hardy was also forcing himself to be funny. Whoever wrote the script sucks. Or he wrote it for children. Movie sucks.",Venom
2054,cabotlboyd,Entertaining but not the best movie,6,3 November 2018,"I thought the movie was very entertaining and was excited to see another Marvel character on the big screen. The effects were amazing which is a good thing because of the heavy dependence on CGI in the movie trying to bring Venom to life. The script was not well written and was kind of disappointing, leaving Tom Hardy nothing to work with. Even with a lackluster script, Hardy did a great job of showing the stress and fear of adapting to the ""parasite."" He did a great job of projecting his internal conflict with his physical acting because the script did not help him much.
There were a few holes in the plot that were a bit distracting. The first coming in the first few minutes of the movie with the forced breakup of Eddie Brock and Anne Weying. The relationship seemed perfect at the beginning and then Eddie does one thing and they call it. Just didn't seem very realistic. Another one is when Carlton Drake merged with Riot. The merge seemed to go perfectly unlike others in he movie. The symbiotes killed several people in the lab and with Venom and Eddie, there was a lot of trouble and pain, causing Eddie to get sick and a lot of physical pain. But with Riot and Drake, there was none of that which was very surprising because Riot is supposed to be more powerful than Venom so one would believe that he would fight Drake a lot more.
As a casual movie goer, I enjoyed it a lot. Fun action scenes and a great lead man. But as a critic, I thought it did not live up to its potential. A good atmosphere that fit the character well but the script and a couple of plot holes really held it back from its true potential.Casual Score: 7.7/10
Critic Score: 6.1/10",Venom
2055,benbrindle-78369,Unexpected,6,9 February 2019,"Starting with the story line , it's interesting. The beginning part of the movie could of been worked however afterwards the storyline becomes very addictive due to the comedic , action packed story.
Personally the critics went too hard on this film and over thought every aspect, yes the movies not perfect but it's well worth watching.",Venom
2056,mikedk1,Quality,10,3 October 2018,"Was anxious about watch but is a quality

2057,violinloversofia,Fun but Falls Short,7,7 October 2018,"This movie wasn't horrible. It was action packed, and I liked the characters and concept of the film. There was no problem there. It was a solid entertaining piece. My problem was with character depth and plot. First of all, there were so many loose ends in this movie that I left the theater frustrated. Let's start of with the simbyodes. Weren't there 4 of them?? Whatever happened to the fourth one that was left in that lab? Did that one die? Then there was the whole idea of the organ failure they cause on their human host, even if they're a match. Now, when it seemed Venom had died, I thought this was fine because now Eddie would get to live completely in the end. But then we find out he's still alive? Um, hello? What about Eddie's organs?? Then we have that doctor who got killed for bringing Eddie into the lab. I know she was a very minor character, but it rubbed me the wrong way that her kids and family were mentioned and nothing was ever explained about what happened there. Maybe this is because she's a minor character, but I would've liked to seen more. Then, what's up with Anne being able to still live in her fancy apartment, jobless and with Eddie gone. Eddie definitely didn't have the luxury of having a nice place, so why did she? And how did she fall in love so fast after breaking up with a man she was going to marry? Then there's the whole idea of Venom staying on Earth. Organ failure aside, I'm confused as to what his motivations for staying on Earth are? Because I'm pretty sure the ""millions"" of other aliens in space are hungry too (and according to Venom already know about humans and their snack potential). Are him and Eddie going to team up and fight against them? And him changing his mind so quickly, deciding to stay on Earth and have a good time instead of take over? That was a little fast.In terms of depth, I found nothing really for the characters. For the main scientist, what was his motivation. It didn't seem like he was money hungry, and for someone trying to save the Earth, he sure is killing a lot of people. What was his deal? Family issues maybe? Then there's Anne. First she's freaking out. Then she accepts it all and decides to ride along. That was fast. She felt very much The Girl where she doesn't really have a lot of purpose other than for superficial depth and just to tag along and support out main protagonist. But other than that, I wasn't really a fan of her. And her new boo? He was barely there at all, I saw no real reason to have him there. It just added a whole nother plot line that wasn't taken care of in the end. The CGI was a little too phlegmy for me. When Riot and Venom were fighting, I could barely tell them apart. The writing for Venom's character wasn't very good, either. Everything he said was predictable and cliche. This movie didn't suck, it wasn't horrible, but it just fell short of my expectations. With Marvel movies always being pretty good, and with gemstones out like Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of The Galaxy being produced from their studios, I really thought this movie was going to be better. It just felt like the cousin you like at a party but forget about once he leaves back home. If I could, I'd give this movie a 6.5/10z",Venom
2058,veritymaybury,"A solid marvel movie, should have been an 18",8,5 October 2018,"Don't listen to the critics, give this film a look. It's somehwre in between Deadpool and the rest of the marvel franchises; quite dark and violent, but not quite enough for me.It's pretty in keeping with the comics, some of the scenes feel comic like, it's funny in parts, without going as far as the newer Avenger instalments and exciting. Tom Hardy does a good job and there is rapport between him and venom. I think an 18 rating would have bumped it up higher in my estimations, I would have liked to have see the more gorey bits that were kept off camera.Overall, a good movie, kept my attention throughout.",Venom

I do feel they rushed it. Being a 104min movie is standard definitely should have made it 140min if so I would have most likely give it a 9 star rating.
They really should have had a few more scenes letting Eddie (Tom Hardy) and Venom going vigilante or causing some mayhem throughout San Francisco. 
Other than that it has a great lead up to another film, I personally look forward to watching it.

Now while I saw hints of this, the sheer humor and creativity of Venom's and Eddie's ""bromance"" does a lot more than just ""save the day""-- it makes this movie go beyond any other superhero movie (including the formulaic movies we see from MCU) ever made, because it is the first movie actually centered around a supervillain. It is funny, absolutely awe-inspiring, and so terrifyingly violent that even my Mom (who is so critical that she thought Infinity War sucked) actually liked Venom, and to me, that says a lot.So please, do yourself a favor and see this movie before it goes out on DVD because you will be missing out on a historical milestone if you don't.",Venom

Yet somehow, it managed to disappoint me on even that level. Everything about this movie is just subpar garbage meant for setting up a sequel. Tom Hardy is an astounding actor in every movie he's been in so far , but not even he can save this movie. Every character has a lack of motivation with no actual development.

The music is good but does drowned out a few scenes and I'm guessing they had to cut a few little scenes so that it could stay at a 15 rating. All in all this film is definitely worth the watch and I'm hoping there is a sequel very soon.",Venom

I'm wondering if they were paid. Wow. Coming from a huge Spider-Man fan... and If you call yourself a Spider-Man fan... please listen up. One of Spider-Man's best villains, is Venom. Venom's story has always been an interesting one... and this movie/origin story didn't dissapoint. Hardy, as always, and of course in any role he plays... played what I would call an absolutely amazing ""protagonist/antagonist"" as Eric Brock. He delivered this character in a way that I would relate to Toby Maguire to Spider-Man in 2002. Memorable, amazing, genuine, genius. Just watch it.",Venom
2073,amarhdelvin,Pretty good,6,5 October 2018,"Venom wasn't the best Marvel film this year but it certainly wasn't bad. It had really good action scenes including the motorcycle chase and Venom facing the swat team. Of course with every film there are some negatives, they tried to make Venom quite funny but sometimes it didn't feel right. Eddie Brock was actually quite a funny person, as well their will be scene's that will make you laugh. The relationship between Eddie and Venom was well executed. Of course this film would've of been much better if it was rated R because Venom is the character that we want to see bitting heads off.",Venom

It's not really scary, but there's a lot of violence going on in this movie and some things are a bit ""cringy"", which makes the movie very very good in my opinion.The movie did have some holes in there which weren't explained.

2077,djw-98009,"a good movie, despite what the critics may say",9,6 December 2018,"Venom isn't a necessarily ""artistic"" movie, but that's what makes it so good. it doesn't try to be something it's not and fully embraces the camp it embodies. sure, it doesn't have fantastic shot composition or lighting or soundtrack or any of the other little details that people believe makes a movie great, but it has a spirit that is intoxicating.i often can't focus very well on movies; i'm likely thinking about something else while watching or questioning the logic. during venom, however, i was completely sucked in. i only realized once the credits started rolling that i had enjoyed the movie so much. i was completely and utterly enraptured.venom is a lot of fun and is one of the best movie-going experiences i've had all year. i enjoyed it fully and thoroughly. if you're planning on watching venom, leave all expectations at the door, because it is not what the critics say it is.",Venom

LOVED IT, the relationship between Eddie and Venom was really well done they literally fed off each other. Tom hardy was fantastic and acted his little heart out. Bit of humour as always but not enough to turn it into a comedy show your usual sarcastic comments and it still had its dark elements throughout. Story was good may of taken a little while for some to start but I think that times important as it gives you time to really invest in Eddie and his character before venoms introduced and it's worth it.

My biggest problem though was the decision the Venom symbiote took in deciding to 'save' Earth instead of allow the invasion. I mean...why? Why would he want this when he hardly knew the host or anything that would allow him to want to save...anything.After watching I thought...was this the best they could have done with the material they had? Absolutely not. Enjoyable, a bit disappointing, sloppy writing in places. Example - why expend a section of the movie highlighting the fact that it's so difficult to find a host and symbiote that combine to each other when, all of a sudden, Eddie fuses nicely, so does his girlfriend and then so does the evil billionaire genius who started the whole business in the first place?!?!?!

Tom Hardy gives a pretty good performance, and all of venom's lines were actually pretty funny. My two problems: To much head-biting-off; it felt like they just wanted more and more violence. And second, the design of Riot looks like a silver lizard. They could have just recoloured venom, but no, they made a lizard man. Oh, and they could've included more of the symbiotes.

I will say however that I didn't enjoy Annie at all, I feel like her character wasn't necessary (and if she's in the comics then... I don't know, I feel she brought nothing to the movie's story line but I'm guessing Marvel wanted to appeal to all audiences... so I get it.

The biggest flaw in the movie is really that a few characters could have been written better, which does hold it back a bit. It's nothing terrible, but nothing amazing either.

2107,tammybawesome,"Don't believe the critics, this was Marvelicous fun.",8,5 November 2018,"I don't know who was acting a fool or why some critics were being overly pathetic with regards to reviewing this movie, but what I can tell you, is that for the first of its kind Villan/anti hero film for this story line of Marvel movies from Iron man up (I ain't speaking about pure Iron Man Marvel movies like Blade etc and they are Anti heros, not villains), I think Marvel did a great job bringing one of their worst Villans to life and keeping in line with what is required of Marvel Movies, in order for them to bring Venom into the mix. Sorry it wasn't the blood and gore you were hoping for, but the whole point of Marvel heros is that it's generally for the teens (like hello, we were those big eyed teens once and wouldn't it have been crap if we couldn't go watch Venom because it was only for adult viewing??). It was everything I hoped it would be and Tom Hardy is the perfect bad boy to love. I can't wait to see how they bring him into the Marvel fold, as there are two more Spiderman movies to go and we need some spice. Stop being Haters, take it for face value and for me, growing up with these heros and Villans I would say the voice was perfect and Tom did this movie justice!",Venom
2108,goldenfett,Amazing And Thrilling Movie!,10,28 October 2018,When I first say the tralier for this movie I didn't think much about it but when I went to watch it was way better then what I expected to to be like. I liked it alot becuase it had a different feeling to a marvel movie by having a villan and not a hero kinda like the feeling of watching deadpool but in a different way.Overall amazing movie very thrilling movie and highly recomended!,Venom

Good first movie, really looking forward to the second one, as many i hope that a second movie will be R rated.
This one I will definitely buy on dvd to watch again.",Venom
2113,taylagracebrown,Wasn't what I was expecting,7,20 November 2018,Being a Tom Hardy film I was expecting great things but I was left a little perplexed after seeing this film. I would not fault the acting because Tom is very talented and has not had a made film in my eyes however what stumped me most was the portrayal of the character Venom itself. I felt like the movie turned into a bit of a comedy so I found it difficult to take the storyline seriously... There was too many jokes to make this a seriously groundbreaking film. I was a little disappointed.,Venom
2114,taggedinblue,Now I'm not saying this is the worst movie ever made...,1,15 January 2020,"But I'm saying this is the worst movie I've ever seen... probably.I don't even know where to start, but the flaws boil down essentially to key problems. In a short simple way, I can say that there are some things this movie does god awful, some that are okay but nothing noteworthy and not a single thing positive whatsoever. I was challenged to say a single good thing about it after seeing it in theaters, and I couldn't, I seriously tried.1. The Script, which for the most part was serviceable. As the core of the movie, what it's about, the mood, theme, the plot, the premise, it holds a lot of responsibility and yet this movie was the first movie that I've notice had an underwhelming script. Be real with me, is there any degree of nuance to a character that is the underdog but does righteous things fighting against a corporate obvious evil guy with no ulterior movies other than because... power I guess? It's not *bad*, but when I think of the scenes, the scenery, the characters, nothing stands out. There's nothing to grasp! And I just wanted more, man, like a concept that they could explore further, it's no shame to want more out of a movie. People can like what they like but I feel like most people fail to see how a product like this could be better and just accept it as is, and I'm not saying *I* can do it better but I'm saying it *easily* could be better, painfully so in fact.2. The Marketing. This in the end is a super hero movie, you cannot come to me and say to my face that this is an ""antihero"" movie and convince me otherwise, especially after a few years later when we would get Joker. This is literally the formula to a superhero movie but a little edgier, but not *too* edgy mind you, we don't wanna raise that rating, no, we want an antihero character that literally explicitly tells on screen to ""only eat the bad guys."" It lacks confidence, if you're going to make it dark, if you're going to make it about a character that's bordering on the ""dark path"", if you're going to make it about an alien that kills and eats people then why on earth would you censor everything, pan out or cut out of the screen any moment that something of the like would happen. In the end I felt like I barely saw any of it, and you can ask me: would increasing the rating make the movie any better? Add some blood and some dark humor? The answer is maybe, I guess, slightly.
In the end the prime point of what I'm trying to say is... when I think of the promo stuff done for this movie, I think of that big bold lettering on the trailer saying ""The World Has Enough Superheroes"", and yet here you created a superhero that sometimes kills people offscreen. Although marketing doesn't objectively make a movie bad, it did sour me up watching it and it does kinda devalue the product knowing it was a marketing stunt in the end.3. None of the fights were entertaining, I know how technically impressive it is for the vfx of black goo moving around the place, but there's little to no tension especially at the end of the movie, which, surprised be you (but not really) it's just two goo monsters fighting each other. Not only is it boring but it's also disorienting, they can morph to whatever shape they want so the fight boils down to just shape shifting until one loses I guess. The only interesting fight was the cramped apartment followed by the motorcycle scene, but those scenes also lacked tension to me because it seemed obvious nothing bad would happen to the protagonist plus I was distracted by something else that bothered me greatly (see ""4. Venom""). Overall for a movie that's supposed to be action packed, it failed to be gripping and that's a huge minus for me.4. Venom sucks, the icon of the entire movie sucked. He's not badass; he's not evil, he's goofy as hell and the filter on his voice was so overdone it was almost comical. I'm not alone on this either; I see comments on videos saying that they thought he was cute, like what the f-, that can't be what they were aiming for when they wrote the character. The visuals might look kinda cool but when attached to this goofy mess of a character it completely lack any threatening presence, not to mention every time they did that face effect thing I winced, it looks awful. I damn you not Venom himself says, as a moment of reunion and redemption to the protagonist, that ""on his planet, he was a loser too."" What does that even mean, like was he was a loser that got bullied in alien school by the older symbiotes. If Venom was supposed to be the comic relief then that's the worst possible character you could ever put as a comic relief. Way to ruin an interesting character.5. The Villain sucked, there was not a person on earth that didn't see it coming that this man would be the main antagonist and that he would be there in the big fight at the end. No twist, no anything, he has no qualities to his character, he's just an evil dude. I'm not just talking about Corporate Mcbusinessman either, the symbiote that he attaches to is also just as lame as Venom. There's nothing much to that symbiote. Most of the movie's inclusion of him is just him spawning in Smallville Nowhere and traveling all the way to the place where the plot conveniently is, those scenes serve to give fear like he's a force to be reckoned except that build up leads to a broken mess of a fight that doesn't pay off at all. Going back to the script thing, won't you at least admit that the premise of ""stopping evil dude from releasing a rocket that could doom the earth"" is kinda lame? Not everything has to be a matter of saving the earth, that just makes it more like a regular super hero movie.The last thing I can mention is that bizarre kissing scene that speaks for itself and that perfect icing on the cake garbage end credits song Venom that was made by Eminem, I had listened to Kamikaze just flabbergasted at that song and was waiting for the moment it would pop up on the movie. In retrospect I should've expected it would be at the end credits, it wouldn't fit anywhere else but it did serve as a culmination of my feelings towards this movie, like it thinks it's cool but it's just plain bad. I dipped out of the theater pronto.Enjoy this movie if you can, I for the life of me can't. It failed to me in every way.1/10",Venom
2115,silviosimonn,"This is not for everyone,",7,5 January 2019,"But especially fans of the character should like this. I especially like how it pays some great homage to the 90s cartoon (minus anything involving Spider-man, that is). They nailed every dark impulse of Venom, yet kept the human element in tact. In fact, for a dark movie, a lot of humor was there to balance it out. Now, dark humor, mind you. You can't forget the character you're going to go see. I personally think that, though entertaining, Michelle Williams' character was a little bit too much like Gwen Stacy for me...which may bring back thoughts of Spider-man 3 which you don't want. Tom Hardy was pretty convincing...but nothing super special. As a side note, I'm glad a certain counterpart was included, but not how he was. Hint: the Little Orphan Annie wig is kinda unforgivable. Cheers! Prepare to have fun, confusing, mixed-emotions time.",Venom
2116,sonofnick,Venom isn't Spiderman,4,9 December 2018,"I had a lot of hope for this movie. I thought it would be darker. I thought they would have used Venom as the monster he should be.
Instead it was just Spidey in a black suit. Yes, I know it wasn't Parker, but it might as well been.
There was so much potential to do something different here. Really disappointed.",Venom
2117,shawncrutchfield,Great Action,7,14 January 2019,Great movie the only think that felt off was spiderman didnt make any form of apperence ive always been one for the explanation the the symbiotes (Powers) come from enhanceing their hosts abilities while adding some of their own . So it always made sense when his incial style while being very venom ill add still had things such as spidey sense/web like appendages/swings/etc.Stan Lee also made what i believe to be his last cameo so its touching on a deeper level then just another superhero movie.Action is great they found a good middle ground for being what exactly Venom is an antihero grantid i believe venom was nice alot quicker then i expected but theyve got him biteing heads off so i guess its cool.,Venom
2118,johnne_plutt,disapointing,5,11 December 2018,"As usual with marvels, totally predictable and maybe is for 12-16 year olds.",Venom
2119,aparnagupta-02598,Movie was much better than critics consensus,9,22 December 2018,"I thought it was a great movie, though it doesn't follow the comic to a T or word for word that is something that we should really be accustomed too. I have not watched one comic book movie other than Captain America be close remotely close to the comic. They did a good job with splitting the time between Eddie and Venom, good comic relief between the two characters is a plus. I'm sure they are trying to hone a little big of Deadpool style comedy. All in all good flick and I would watch it again. 9/10",Venom
2120,vnilsen-86419,"Pretty good, and that's coming from a non-comic person",9,5 January 2019,"I'm not a Super hero movie kind of person. I can't keep track of the averngers movies or their adjoining films. I never got into X-men, Superman, and Batman for that matter (however I though Heath ledger as the joker was excellent!). That all being said....I really enjoyed Venom. I think Tom Hardy is an excellent actor and his performance in this was great (FYI, if you haven't seen The Drop, you should). I found the movie interesting, funny and enjoyable. I laughed a lot, enjoyed the characters and the story.",Venom
2121,gsoultaker,"I liked it, knowing the comics or not. Good Movie, Hardy was awesome!",8,6 January 2019,"I liked it, may was not approach to the real history in the comics, but he did a great job representing our Venom, maybe the next movie catch more close the real history in the comics..

2125,zarobea,Fun time at the theater,8,30 April 2019,"Although I would have preferred Venom as a character to be featured in an R-rated movie, I still had a great time. Tom Hardy really does wonders with whatever he plays, and the he as Eddy and Venom's back and forth relationship really made me invested in them both. Glad to see Michelle Williams participate in the super hero movie scene and her presence was very heartwarming and I just loved her character. Went to the movie to have fun, and I did.",Venom
2126,stevehobday,Easy to watch,7,25 February 2019,"Maybe Not Tom's best work (I am a fan - but as for Actor, the Director/plot is what they have to work with), but an easy to watch film. Not being a massive Marvel fan, I found this better than most.",Venom
2127,srinavina,Movie or just cgi,1,5 March 2019,Funny ...this movie is so over rated and the producers ( forget about the senseless direction) that movies are all about sound and special effects( so naive ....go back to the real masters of movie making .... got marveled for a penny but without the art ...'.tencent ' out of the dollar ....better spend at bugger king !,Venom
2128,ochirooorgilon,A great film for anti-hero character,7,8 March 2019,"One of the best anti hero character movie. Film has kept all simple yet entertaining. There was no confusion about how the movie started and ended, as all were perfectly placed. Tom Hardy no doubt as always different and bring something fresh. No question to the talent he has and should be use by marvel where they could. It's sad though Venom will not be the part of avengers in near future same like wolverine. Wherein this could have been gone to another level of greatness.
However, since after credits they have now revealed that sequel to Venom is confirmed so thing will be exciting. Great display of acting and direction. Script is handle very well with good visuals.",Venom
2129,carolsepinna,It was a good film.,8,13 June 2019,I had watched the movie the think i don't like about it is it doesn't have Spiderman but for making a new universe from a movie this movie is perfect I'll recommend you to watch it on higher resolution and watch everyone this movie is perfect with its own concept.,Venom

2131,ME_EMMA,Not great by any means but manages to be a fun ride,7,5 May 2019,"Don't bother with the ""critics"" rating of the movie, this is a good movie over all. The beginning starts slow, with Tom Hardy's character being a screw up, but the movie gets exponentially better as time goes on. Tom Hardy does a great job as Venom and brings his usual dry humor as well. I thought it was a great movie, especially if you are into comic books or Marvel in general. I really hope they make a Venom 2!",Venom
2132,ljones-95038,A Colossal Waste Of Time,1,1 May 2019,"This movie does almost nothing right. The acting is awful, the script is awful, the shots are awful, the editing is awful, and everything is incredibly uninspired and by the book. There is something annoyingly off about the cgi, like it hadn't fully rendered before work on the film finished. The fact that this movie was released baffles me. I have no idea where the $110 million went, but it has a box office of $855 million, so I guess I can't wait for the sequel?You might find enjoyment in laughing at this movie, but I could not, even though I enjoy laughing at bad movies. Otherwise, don't waste your time.",Venom
2133,Gabriel_Youngs,Critics = bad,8,18 May 2019,"I had heard bad things from critics about this film, but regardless I went to see it because I am a big fan of both Hardy and Venom (the character). I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and I would love to see a sequel!

2135,LEOSCH_REH,Underrated,10,19 May 2019,"It is truly refreshing to see a good old superhero movie in the continuously expanding and slightly trivialized marvel universe. It was cool to see all our heroes on the same screen. But the fundamental concept of an origin story still beats it all. In all the recent Marvel motion pictures the essence of the genre seemed a little lost to me.
The classic superhero movie as we love it is not about action. Not about super fancy special effects. And not a comedy. It is about an under dog standing up for what is right. It is about the hero we all wished we were. And about the hero we all can be everyday in whatever life we lead.
Thanks Venom for making me realize that!",Venom

2138,allisongouveia,Venom and Eddie were cute together but it was a miss,7,16 May 2020,This was alright. I wish this was more dark and gritty and had more carnage because venom is a parasite but they took the more comedic root which was alright but it ended up being very generic. I wanted a more mature R rated movie but instead we got some pg-13 basic stuff. It overall it felt held back from its great potential. The plot and script seemed like the writers weren't even trying. It was just a bit unsatisfying.,Venom
2139,steelyxd,A pretty good movie,9,7 August 2019,"In my opinion, there shouldn't be so many negative reviews. Some of the people are just impossible to please these days.

It's a main problem - authors created a product for children, it seems like they were concerned about age rating even more than about movie quality. Venom can't scare at all, his murders are completely bloodless even if he beheads an enemy. Weh he had eaten one guy there was NO SINGLE drop of blood on floor. It looks so unnatural and weird.",Venom

2146,lukasrya,Critics are Harsh,5,14 April 2020,"I think that critics were a little harsh on the movie. It wasn't as bad as they make it out to be. I do think that a more well-known villain should've been chosen, however, I think that Tom Hardy did an amazing job as Eddie Brock and that he should be in the next couple movies involving Venom. I can't wait for Venom 2, because I am excited to finally see a live-action Carnage.",Venom
2147,thejackcrosby-78543,This movie should be rated R,1,25 January 2021,"I thought Sony knew what they were doing with this IP but I was so wrong. The MCU has made all these studios wanna use the same blueprint and that should not be used in a Venom movie. This movie should be dark and have both body and psychosocial horror. If they wanted to eventually crossover with Spider-Man that's fine being PG13 in the future, but the origin story should be R. Now if the sequel with Carnage, who is a horrifying entity, isn't R, that will be terrible. That'd be like making Deadpool PG13. it goes for stupid laughs like that lobster tank scene. Eddie Brock is suppose to be a bodybuilder too, I love Tom Hardy, but he really doesn't make a good Eddie Brock for me. Sony is 0/2 on Eddie Brock casting. It's not to say this movie is a 1/10, but the fact that it's not very true to venom while also not being very good makes the movie a 1/10. It's been proven many times with Deadpool, Logan, and now Joker that R rated superhero, or antihero, or villain movies can be R and successful",Venom
2148,ethanhickman-41912,Great,8,12 September 2020,"The casting was on point, Tom hardy was excellent for the roll. Good bits of action here and there. Only think I'd like is more action.

2149,email-714,"Good, not great Deadpool / Spiderman amalgamation",7,12 October 2018,"The movie was trying very hard to capture the Deadpool audience, and almost managed it. I feel it should have either went the full 18 (with blood and gore, especially when the heads were eaten) or it should've gone for the 12 rating and toned it down ever so slightly. It sort of felt it was neither by sitting in the middle.Tom Hardy was immense in the role, and the movie genuinely felt like the role was written with him in mind. The banter between symbiote and Eddie was excellent, and almost managed to keep the cliches and corniness under control. The 'loser' part pissed me off though.Michelle Williams was as wooden as I expected (hated her in The Greatest Showman too). A poor leading lady I felt.The element of the film that captured me the most was the visuals - it was an utter delight to watch, and absolutely could not be enjoyed at home the same. All in all very enjoyable, was clearly a 'welcome to a new character' movie, but one that could hold its own unlike some (looking at you Suicide Squad, and every Spiderman movie ever)A solid 6.8 (lost a clear point on the 'loser' conversation)",Venom

Don't get me wrong this movie couldve been even better but i was satisfied with what I got.Tom Hardy is the man for this rol and his acting is on spot.
Venom is amazing the relationship between him and Eddie Brock is top notch.
The plot for this origin story is quite interesting and better then what I expected.
The special effects are awesome especially when you see the transformations.Overall I highly recommend this movie and hopefully you dont buy into all of the critics non-sense , YES this movies is good and YES it is possible for a VENOM movie without Spider-man so YES go ahead and watch it and you wont be dissapointed.",Venom

Maybe they wanted to introduce someone who can ""retain control over their body and mind"" from Venom, whatever the case maybe, it became the reason for lower ratings and not upto the viewer's expectations.",Venom
2163,tomryannova,Loved this movie,9,8 October 2018,"I pretty much hate superhero movies. The endless kungfu fights bore me to death. But I loved 'Logan' which was a well acted very humanistic, realistic super hero movie and thought I'd never top that. But Venom is close. Not quite the gravity of Logan plot wise, but a very conflicted main character. Tom Hardy is a force, never bet against him. He is awesome in this movie. The other characters are good as well Riz Ahmed and Michelle Williams. The movie is a little scary, which may be a problem for younger viewers.",Venom
2164,tomryannova,Loved this movie,9,8 October 2018,"Never bet against Tom Hardy -- he picks good movies to act in and he delivers on his performance. He does it again in this. Movie is a little scary (it is Venom after all), which may be a problem for younger viewers.",Venom
2165,ken-goulding,Flawed,6,3 February 2019,"Tom Hardy is excellent, the CGI is amazing but the dialogue, pacing and storyline is very average. I watched this with my 12 year old son who thought it was just OK. Im finding all these fawning 10 star reviews a little hard to take seriously. A cynical attempt by the produers of this movie to increase the IMDB score perhaps! I know its all about opions but there is no way this is a 10 star movie (in my humble opion). A generous 6 at best.",Venom
2166,chello-4,Great...,7,5 October 2018,Great movie. Funny and gritty. Could have been a tad bit on the darker side. They have good bones to work with for the second go round. Hopefully they can push for an R-rating.👍,Venom

At first I though this was going to be a sub-par movie due to the critics reviews so I had low expectations for Venom.I was wrong - it's a good movie with a decent plot and great acting. Also, Tom Hardy always delivers.I can't say it's on-par with other Marvel movies like Iron man, Thor or The Avengers but it's still very enjoyable and worth the money.Definitely see it if you can!",Venom

2171,jerryterhorst-1,Fun and entertaining--what's the big deal with the reviews?!,7,1 January 2019,"Everyone got their panties in a bunch because Venom, the symbiote, was kind of a dork at times (""On my planet, I was a loser like you""), which flies in the face of him being a demonic killing machine. However, I liked this because it seemed super realistic: Venom needs Brock, and if he goes Insane Monster 3000™ on the world, Brock would just crank up the stereo and blast him to hell. So, on the contrary, I found the symbiote's portrayal refreshingly realistic for how that relationship would have to be if it was truly ""real"".Tone is a bit all-over-the-place, but I didn't mind it. It was at times violent, action-packed, funny, or scary. But it all worked for me.",Venom
2172,NDsafarah,It's Tom Hardy!,8,4 October 2018,"I don't care if everybody gonna hate this movie, the action looks entertaining and Marvel made a great decision to choose Tom as the main role. It might be a little but boring, but it still had jokes in it which is played perfectly by Tom. Not to mention his acting all over this movie was mesmerizing. Not a fan of superhero movies, only watch this for Tom. And yeah, fortunately he done a great job in this movie. I'm gonna love this movie only because Tom Hardy is in it! Period.",Venom

I'm sure the actor is a fine gent but his character failed to impress me, hence the 6/10 score. The script was pretty hokey as well. And in closing: Possibly the worst direction Tom Hardy has ever received.",Venom

I've heard critics saying how bad this movie is going to be for months now, but.... This film is great fun. There are some issues, sure - characters behaving without apparent motivation, choppy segues, bad 3D if you go for that option (don't) etc - but things move along at a nice enough pace to let you put them aside for later consideration.",Venom
2183,logosgnosis,More or less faithful and fun,6,22 October 2018,"6/10 is actually a fairly high rating for me, especially for this kind of movie. It's above average, certainly, and extra credit for featuring my favorite childhood anti-hero. If you're a Marvel fan and you read comics as a kid I doubt you'll be disappointed by the rendering of Venom, or Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock (although, as ever, I would've preferred a blend of CG with practical effects - Venom was entirely CG). If you're new to the character it's still a fun and complete movie. Nothing earth-shattering, but solid all around, and gratifying from a fan angle.",Venom

Excellent Acting and direction; You wont realize the 90 minutes flashing through. It's fast, it's fun; it's pure adrenaline rush.

Turned out to be a very fun and well paced action super hero moview, even ended to quickly to be honest. Nothing special about the story, just like most super hero movies but you definetely going to enjoy it you want to see a fun super hero flick. I feel like some critics sold out long time ago, I dont get how Black Panther can get so much praise, while this gets so much hate for example. If you like super hero movies, go see this!",Venom

It oddly feels like it should've come out in the mid 00's - the cgi and action sequences aren't on par with what we're seeing in the other Marvel movies lately.

The villain is generic & STUPID. 
The love interest is shallow & STUPID. 
Even Venom himself is STUPID. (I didn't think it was possible)Sony didn't learn one thing from what Warner Bros did with the DC universe and rushed into this project thinking more about the sequels than the actual movie.I had a bad time with the final battle of Black Panther because parts of it were too dark, here it's just a nightmare. I genuinely could not tell what was going on.  Tom Hardy did a great job and his performance is the only good thing about this movie. It makes me really sad that he wasn't given a decent plot. Venom is an awesome character with some huge stories in the comics but he is once again mistreated by Sony.",Venom

If you want to have a good time, go watch it. Don't let Grumpy Old Critics that are only looking for movies the are worthy of an award. Paid Critics that only say negative things about movies, Women that want to cry from a sad movie...I could go on and on but I'm not. This will always happen to movies. All those people will try to ruin it for us. We just got out of the theater not to long ago and YES!!! We enjoyed most of this movie. Some parts of the movie were kinda dumb and probably didn't make much sense but I'm not here to give it a low score for that. If it's a point system, we gave it and then took some away but mostly gave it back points until the very end. We thought the movie was funny, crazy, exciting, action as well. Even though some of the CGI was kinda crappy at some point, this movie was enjoyable. My group ages were Early 40s and my 15 year old son.if there were any complaints,it would have been about the seats than the movie...so there, go watch it and be your own critic.",Venom

If you walk into this film expecting a link to the Spider-verse or a warm fuzzy cuddle from your memories of a marvel sub character you will probably be disappointed.If, however, you sit down with no expectations and to just be entertained you will probably not be disappointed. I loved it, there was enough cleverly choreographed action involving and alien from out of space. That'll do. Put your artistic fanboyish writer/director hats in your back pocket, sit down, shut up and let the symbiote take over.",Venom
2214,specialclay,Enjoyed it and I know Venoms history,9,14 October 2018,You have to dismiss comic book versions and the fact that Spiderman is no where to be found. Tom Hardy's portrayal of Eddie Brock is fabulous. Great story once again forget about the past. Enjoy it for now,Venom

2221,gautamania270,"I was hoping for the movie to wash away the negativity yet again,and it happened by a long shot !",8,5 October 2018,"Before I begin, I'd clarify that I'm no comic reader and the only thing I knew about Venom was that he is a Spiderman Villain and the only time I saw him before, live action or otherwise was in Raimi's Spiderman 3 but as with everybody I've been a fan of the character,and secondly I watched the film Hindi dubbed.
From past sometime, it's as if there is some kind of propoganda working against the Sony. It's understandable that it's the job of the critics to find flaws in the movie and write about them and they need to be appreciated for the work they do but the kind of Undermining articles that I read about the Venom after its screening were just too hard to believe. Plenty of things were said about the plot holes, how the comical bits impose themselves and whatnot but unless I'm a total dummy; something which I highly doubt I couldn't find one such single flaw which would have remained at the back of my head throughout the run time of the film, much less something I'd give a second thought after the movie gets over.
It was a well paced fine entertainment and infact people cheered in so many scenes where I watched the film. 
As is the case with me, if I read about some film being too bad and if I happen to watch it in the theatre, the first that I do is empty my mind of all the preconceived thoughts and take one scene at a time, I failed to do that in case of The Nun because it's story was really that bad but this film had nothing of the sort. It infact immersed me completely and there was fun all along.
It could be said that the major villain Riot appeared a bit too late but even that wouldn't be the reason for me to hate the film. Action scenes are solid, chemistry between Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams isn't bad either and story is pretty good. Where do I find the hate from then, and why should I bother finding it?
They did the same thing with The Meg and it's box office collections are for everybody to see and after a few years from now, people would hail the film for being a rejuvenating film in the Shark horror department and critics will be forgotten. I'm hopeful that same would happen with Venom and who will become the turd in the wind; The venom or the critics will be for everybody to see.
My best wishes for the movie :-)",Venom

Marvel fans who are fixated on Venom being a Spiderman villain and that he only should be allowed to exist within the Spiderman universe as Spidey's antagonist.People who expect a horror movie with lots of blood and gore, where Venom goes on a killings spree.People who will like the movie:
Everyone who doesn't care too much about the Marvel connection and can accept it as what it is: a unique mix of a funny buddy comedy and a monster movie with a touch of romance.What made the movie is the partnership between the great Tom Hardy, who obviously has a lot of fun playing this character, and his new ""roommate"", who is actually pretty likable as he kinda fits the stereotype of the ""the bad boy who is actually a big softy"". Well, not too much of a softy. ^^",Venom

While fans of the comics might not like some of the changes that have been made, I find it hard to believe that it's enough to ruin the experience. The CGI isn't perfect (especially noticeable when Eddie and Venom have their first face-to-face conversation) and some other small factors take away from the believability (if it can be called that) but the film is still THOROUGHLY entertaining and a huge upgrade from Venom's appearance in Spider-Man 3. Tom Hardy obviously takes the cake with his portrayal as Eddie Brock but all of the other actors did amazing, believable jobs as well. The only thing I'm really clinging onto is how short the film seemed to be (even though it's not short at all) purely because I was enjoying every second of it. Cannot wait until the sequel.",Venom

Tom was excellent and I liked the bond that he developed with his parasite 😁. I almost never have a desire to watch movie again, but I would watch this over and over again and I would be entertained every time like the first time.. The only thing that I personally didn't like was the lead actress, she was just plane for some reason, it kinda looked to me that her face is full of fillers so she couldn't do much with her face expressions, other than that for me it's a 10 and big recommendations.",Venom

2230,alper_ariburnu,Good but could be much better.,6,10 March 2019,"I have no words for Tom Hardy no more no less he was the greatest choice for this role. However, movie suffers from unnecessary CGI mess.Need of an evil-superhero damaged this movie, for the sake of plot scenario invents Riot for our evil scientist. It goes without saying both Brock and Drake discovers symbiote's weakness; loud noise ( Brock also learns symbiote is susceptible to fire as well from Venom ) and our mad scientist who is pretty much a cynical figure doesn't utilize/invent/stock/possess a sonic gun or figuring out symbiote is weak against fire while conducting loads of tests and arms himself with flamethrowers etc.Also Drake is very powerful on his own. He could easily abduct Anne and force Venom do his bidding just like Lex does to Supes by abducting Martha. Adding Riot only forces filmmakers apply mish-mash of very-fast paced hard to understand full of CGI boss battle which was quite stale.I wish they had directed this without implementing Riot, so they would need less CGI and end up with a better final fight or plot etc.Also if they want to remove spidey it is fine, but why Venom has spider-senses-ish ability?Anyways, decent movie from beginning to mid, then it goes down.",Venom

The cgi is aged, the pacing is okay, the action is terribly quick and disguised in dark settings making it very difficult to see the action, the villan is forgettable, the pg13 rating doesnt help to show off vemons more ruthless side and the metamorphosis that venom goes through in the third act is laughable. The only redeeming qualities is Tom hardy, he did the best he could do with the poor script and the back and forth chemistry with venom was good too.",Venom
2236,Tryfon_Kar,Not bad but under expectations !!!,8,12 November 2018,"I really like MARVEL heroes movies and I was thinking that this movie gonna be much better than the previous ! That not true !
Basically, it was above the previous movies.
The character wasn't so good written but Tom Hardy made him to look like better than the script ! Even though, it was a nice action movie and i really hope that the second part gonna be much better !",Venom
2237,kimiebean311,I highly enjoyed this movie!!,8,18 October 2018,"This movie (to me) was hilarious. Tom Hardy was excellent as Eddie Brock. Pros: The back and forth between Eddie and Venom. The story line. Cons: Michelle Williams. CGI. The beginning and the end was the worst for me but the middle made it all worth it. The action was intense at some points to where I could not focus on any one thing. It was almost like a blur, unrecognizable and hard to focus. I would rather this movie rated R. And hopefully Tom Hardy will be back to play the role of Eddie Brock... and hopefully Carnage will not look like Ronald Mcdonald!",Venom
2238,vaidizzz,I just loved it so much!,10,7 October 2018,"Ar first i was scared i wont like it of the critic reviews, but i tell you what, it was AMAZING!",Venom
2239,dhdregun,When you're tired of the Marvel formula!,8,9 October 2018,"Venom isn't a Marvel movie, for that it succeeds far more than if it had been. If you're getting tired of the Marvel formula then Venom is going to be a breath of fresh symbiotic air. Venom occupies it's own universe, it's dark, gritty and more grown up compared to its counterparts. The existence of Eddie's personal life feels real, his struggles are far more relatable than any other character portrayed in a comic book movie so far. He is an everyday guy who screws up and because of that his need to redeem himself gets him attached to a symbiote. After that hes just trying to stay alive until the very end when the truth of his circumstance means he is the only one who can prevent humanities destruction. The movie didnt lead up to this, it wasnt even known what was to come until the last 20 minutes of the movie.This is a marriage of two separate movies and it's done very well. You remove Venom and the movie feels like it could stand on it's own with a few key changes. The Venom portion hits all the notes required for a superhero movie. You actually care about Eddy and it's not because they give some sappy back story about loss or self reflection. You care because you can actually relate with what happens to him and how you may have reacted in the same scenario. He wasnt rich, a god or born with powers, didnt live with super advanced technology or volunteer for an experiment. Hes just a guy with a 9-5 in a regular relationship and living in the same world where shake downs and homelessness exist.The critics wanted a different movie then what they got. They wanted a basic Marvel super hero movie without realizing one of the better super hero movies as of late (Logan) didnt follow that formula either.Venom is the movie that stands on its own by creating a story with elements suited to the character, not checkboxes like others. Its entertaining and feels like it could have lasted longer. I'd rather feel left wanting then feeling like the movie is now requiring me to continue watching it because it's been dragged out too long.I'd rather watch another Venom movie then any other marvel universe sequel at this point.",Venom
2240,knightofassassin,Loved it,9,3 October 2018,"I went to watch this movie on its first day available where I live, expecting something that I would rate somewhere between 6 and 7. But it went over that and here I am giving it a 9 (more like 8.5 but I rounded it up because it deserves it)While the story itself was not outstanding, the execution was fun and kept me engaged, and that is for me the most important aspect in a movie. Character relationships worked, and the jokes were well placed.Oh, and that kiss!! Omg that kiss! I loved it.The only thing that ever bothered me was that the image quality felt outdated, but I got used to it after 15 minutes in. Then there were the symbiotes, which didn't really blend well with their surroundings.All in all, this is one of my favorite movies of the year. It managed to be gritty when it needed to, and funny when it meant relief. Also, the action sequences were, in a good way, over the top fun.I loved it.",Venom
2241,lostvogue1,Don't believe the fake bad reviews,10,6 October 2018,"It's a very entertaining movie and very comparable to the comics I don't know what the Critics want to see they apparently get paid for reviews seem like. CGI is very good no parts where the cgi looks bad I don't know what everyone was talking about. 
The whole mesh comes together very well don't believe the fake bad reviews",Venom
2242,mdilorenzo87,Well Worth the ticket!!,9,5 October 2018,"I went into this movie not expecting great things because of all the reviews, all I can say is go and see it yourself and don't rely on rottontomatoes. Venom was an all around great flick and surprisingly entertaining. The only thing that could've made the movie better was if they made it a little bit longer. I highly recommend this movie!!",Venom
2243,chacedj,The critics gave this movie a ridiculously low rating,8,19 October 2018,This is so great movie. I'd watch it again for sure.,Venom
2244,unnaturalu,Another huge potential thrown out.,6,15 January 2019,"The ones who highly rated this were probably kids, the ones are not are probably older. So if you're a kid (or a mind of) then you'll like it.Im 40, I don't like it. A movie with Tom Hardy in it deserves a better writting.",Venom
2245,recon_nyn,Not good movie,3,10 October 2018,Seems like missed cast for Riz ahmed. He is the worst about this movie. Tom hardy is good. But still this movie sucks,Venom
2246,TheDarthKnight26,Venom review,7,17 September 2021,"Yes. So, I had a chance to see this and overall, I was moderately to very satisfied. I want to praise particularly the story writers, who obviously stayed true to the comic series that inspired this and of Tom Hardy's acting. This is an actor that can easily go from titular character in Bronson to this role and read from a script that while it being what it is, he can read from it well. Also want to praise the director and production team as they found an actor who is Eddie Brock in true form. It was great to see Venom on screen for the first time. Would love to see a sequel and if they're building up to a Sinister 6 film, obviously follow the main cast and crew and the formula that's being used now. But, want to see them take their time with this build- up though. Would love to meet Spidey showing up in this world.",Venom
2247,cinthiairizarri,Critics are just stupid and trying to sound smart,10,10 October 2018,"The movie was awesome first of all. Second of all, if you watch the movie for what it is.... Fantasy, you'll enjoy it thoroughly. Some people over think it too much. I cant wait to watch the second, and third movie.
Love you Tom Hardy, you're tha best, as always. Your biggest fan, Cinthia 😘",Venom
2248,aswinmahesh7,I loved VENOM🖤,9,6 October 2018,"Venom was Great !!
I really can't understand the critics 😒
Tom Hardy is lifts the film all on his own !
Venom is like your Crazy Super-Attached (😉😁) pet .
Worth it !!!!",Venom
2249,liam-ball1,Ignore the critics,8,29 August 2020,"This movie for me was very enjoyable, it's a starter to a new universe with Sony/marvel and takes a darker look into the character and a lot less family friendly. Would have preferred to be R rated to be even more on that side to make it have a bit more kick. But overall it's a sold film few werid bits and changed needed with the likes of scenes and characters that needed a ending but it's good. The Eddie/Venom relationship is something that draws me back and something I definitely need more of.",Venom
2250,ajith-m-c-86,Indeed a fun filled movie,8,6 October 2018,Venom is a good entertainer. it's not perfect but I am sure every one will enjoy it. The response from the people in theater was all positive. I really don't have any idea why this film is getting a lot of hate and why all the critics are giving negative reviews.,Venom
2251,johnnysimov,Good start for a great character.,7,6 October 2018,"1.The movie's been rly rushed, there were aloot of gaps which made it bit wierd for me, but those gaps could be filled in an ""extended"" cut for BluRay/DVD. 
2.The visual effects were top notch, was rly pleased. 
3. The acting was on point, especially Tom Hardy's performance, no one else couldve played the role better, he nailed it 10/10. Can surely say that he owns the character just like Hugh Jackman owns Wolverine or Ryan Reynolds-Deadpool.
4. There's a rly bright future for the character, if they take their time, and give us the sequal with a better script, it's gonna be amazing..The Amazing Venom.",Venom
2252,jason-628-887203,Great movie!,8,7 October 2018,"Not Shakespeare like so many reviewers seem to be expecting. However, it's a great superhero movie! Wonderful from beginning to end.",Venom
2253,pinbota-640-951588,I didn't make it to the end,1,31 July 2021,"That was probably the worst move I've seen in my whole life. I can't really say I have seen it, because I stopped watching after the chase scene. It was enough, I've seen enough, it's really horrible.I have no luck with Tom Hardy, first Fury Road, now this.Bad acting, boring plot, laughable CGI.Don't watch it, it's only for the brain dead.",Venom
2254,carterdsmith99,Another reason to ignore critics and form your own opinion.,10,5 October 2018,"I saw this movie early on Thursday, rather than the Friday release date. My dad spoke constantly about how Venom would be one of the worst movies of the year based only on the trailer, and, though I was looking forward to it as I'm a fan of the character, I began to lower my expectations. The critic reviews came in on Wednesday and most stated that it would be one of the worst superhero movies of this decade. I can absolutely say after seeing the movie... I completely disagree.The first half of the movie builds on the character of Eddie Brock. Sure, an hour of character development is quite a lot for a superhero movie but it only made me like Eddie more than if it had been 30 minutes of development. Then Venom attaches to him, and we hear him for a while before fully seeing him. Once he appeared in all of his gnarly beauty, I almost stood to clap. He looked perfect. From his large white eyes, to his sharp yet jagged teeth, all the way to his toes. It was a beloved comic character portrayed on the big screen in the best way possible. So what did the critics see wrong with this movie?It was boring. The action was stupid. I couldn't see anything when they were fighting. None of it made any sense. The comedy was ineffective. That's what the critics had to say, and yet I found only one of those to be true. Yes, the beginning is very slow but not enough so to make me bored. I payed attention and I rather enjoyed it. But with everything else... I found that the action was EXTREMELY enjoyable. The lighting, the CGI, the way he moved, it was all gorgeous. The movie wasn't stupid at all, in fact it was quite smart in many cases. (Jenny Slate even changed her awful pronunciation of sym-bye-ote to the correct pronunciation, being symbiote) And the comedy? It was more frequent than I thought it would be, and yet it made me laugh every time. I saw little flaws in this movie.And lastly, to all of the people who only saw the trailers, it did look like it would be terrible. But all of the stupid things in those trailers, mostly cheesy sentences and odd pronunciations, aren't even in the movie! The only thing I noticed that remained was Venom pulling him back onto his motorcycle. It looked awful in the trailer, but it didn't bother me at all while I saw it in the movie. It's better than it might look.Trust me... forget about the trailers. Forget about the critics. Forget about your low expectations for this movie. I loved it, and many others who have written a review here on IMDB loved it too! Go see this movie and form your own opinion, because this isn't a movie that should be missed.",Venom
2255,georgeshomsy-gh,Tom hardy nailed it!!,10,4 October 2018,Dk why some ppl didnt like it was a great movie...not a childish one like the usual marvel movies it has a bit of everything fun horor s_f great story...cant wait for part 2,Venom
2256,soph1019,I LOVED Venom! Now my new favorite,10,9 October 2018,"Do not understand the critics. Maybe it was because my husband explained Venom's background / character. Tom Hardy did an excellent job. But then again when doesn't he?! Venom is a complex character. He is not straight villain, which I loved. Venom is all of us. Watch the movie give it a chance.",Venom
2257,connorkilduff,Thoroughly Enjoyed,8,27 October 2018,"Tom Hardy is great, Venom's raw power make his action scenes awesome and exciting. A pretty decent action movie, praying that Tom and Venom cross into Spiderman in the near future.",Venom
2258,loyafrostwind,Awesomely fun movie!b,8,2 February 2019,This was a fun movie with wonderful acting! Tom Hardy was great at playing Eddie Brock AND Venom. Michelle Williams reminds me of a young Gwyneth Paltrow. Don't pay attention to the critics reviews. Look at all the positive user reviews. I think I can re-watch this many times like I did with Thor: Ragnarok.,Venom

Watch it yourself and yo decide",Venom
2260,serge-bonneure-693-299979,Tom Hardy is the only good thing about this movie.,5,5 October 2018,"What a misser... No matter how good and well Hardy acts (and Venom), all the rest sucks. From actors to editing (timing to earlie or to late, FX's are cheaply done (or in the dark or to fast and blurry), graphics are poor and sometimes completely wrong. I know amateurs who do better jobs at this. Still, for some reason (Hardy) it was more then okay to digest. Would go see Venom2 for sure, if Hardy stays Venom and ALL the rest replaced, Sony included!",Venom
2261,kurtwylde,God I hate the critics,10,8 October 2018,"Wrong again critics. Like your rave reviews of the Last Jedi (one of the worst films I have ever seen) your overly critical reviews of Venom are wrong in the other direction. Please stop your misleading reviews! It is embarassing! The first third of this film plods a bit, but from the scene where Venom first speaks onwards, it is a riot. Funny, great designs on the character, silly, dark, thoroughly entertaining. I don't know why the critics are still in employment. I think any film that ends up having you rooting for a fangy, demonic, head eating, psychotic alien symbiote has to be on to a winner. A few lines fell flat, but aside from the slow opening, this flick is a riot. Good acting from Tom Hardy too. As per usual.",Venom
2262,soomro-mm,"One of the best Marvel franchise movies, hands down.",10,7 October 2018,"Regardless of the critics reviews and the rumors I heard, I went to see it. And I wasn't disappointed. Didn't find anything that didn't belog to an awesome movie plus there was no boring factor in it. Plus the reviewers who described the antagonist as not being suitable for the role, every character fits in their role....
I will recommend to watch the movie before judging by the biased reviews...",Venom
2263,mrhex,Enjoyed it,9,11 January 2019,"Ofcourse if you want to be a comicbook jockey to the details freak. There are things of difference.
But overall, it is there. The plot, Eddie Brock coming into contact with the creature. The creature choosing eddie/earth. The creature atleast for now conforming to some basic rules regarding co-existence.
Also the Eddie/Venom relationship that is being built. I really enjoyed it, there are moments where i feel too much was cut out, if i did not read spiderman all my youth i would not know what it meant.
But most of the time it was done so atleast it felt natural in the area of self preservation, social justice and political science. And for me that read alot of the comics. Fairly to the point as can be expected with all the ""spiderman universes"" taken into consideration.
I gave this title 9/10 not to boost the grade. But simply because i enjoyed it to this grade, i laughed, rejoiced and got treated with some great action, Also at the end got a treat hoping for a spiderman?, venom carnage followup. went to my summer house and brought home two boxes of my old spiderman collection. And had a blast.",Venom

2267,siregar_rio,Unexpectedly bad,5,6 October 2018,"I've waited so long for this movie, the trailer was very intriguing and I love Tom Hardy and Michelle William. So I came with high expectations, but this movie just failed me.It has so much potential to be great movie, too bad the story was so flat, fuzzy and disoriented. For example the Character of Venom, On a scene he ate people's head (there was no trace of the remains body or blood by the way), the other scene he refused to eat Dr. Dan and like Anne on the first sight. It like Anne so much, it told her its weakness...duh!!!Another example, the 1 day Venom 'sinked' to Eddy, it made Eddy ate all the frozen food and the left over cooked chicken from the trash, but in the restaurant he spurted meals because the food is ""dead"" (cook) and ate live lobster instead . There was much more unexplained scene like what made Eddy the right host and what Venom see from Eddy that changed his mind from eating all human and live on Earth to protect the earth and kill Riot (the leader of Symbioth) Despite on the lazy writing, the movie was entertaining, The CGI was okay, Tom Hardy did his best for this movie, I hate Michelle's wig, but her acting was okay. However the rest of the cast was forgetable. I really hope the next Venom movie Will be lot better than this",Venom

2270,tgwall10,A good movie definitely worth the watch,7,5 October 2018,"Venom has great performances and personality with a linear plot and subpar CGI. Venoms biggest problem is that it keeps wanting to go full ridiculous violence but then is kept tame and in line by Sonys obligatory pg14 rating. Sony shouldnt have played it safe and trusted the market for Rrated superhero flicks as Venom would easily have been a contender to Logan and Deadpool. It baffles me how venom has performed worse with critics than such MCU duds like Antman and the Wasp, Thor the dark world, Iron man 2 or the incredible hulk. Venom isn't the best superhero movie you'll ever see as we have been spoiled with great movies in the last decade.",Venom

We have to keep in mind, this is not your regular thriller, not a regular suspense or a love story. This film came straight outta comic book.

I won't go into the cgi, fight sequence, or source material because these things aren't really what mattered to me; I am the wife to a man who wanted to check this movie out, and someone who enjoys the mcu movies: this movie just annihilated all my expectations and I loved every minute of it. Props to Hardy and Williams, especially, for great performances. Hardy brings an unexpected amount of humor into his role and Williams manages to elevate the usual gf role.

I have no idea why critics are hating on it so much. Just go into the movie and make your own opinion. Venom is such an interesting character and his relationship with Eddie Brock is fun to watch. CGI looks great as well.,Venom
2300,mmacoreyjones,Really good movie!! Ignore the bad reviews.,8,5 October 2018,If you're a true venom fan who just wants to enjoy an accurate portrayal of venom on the big screen then go see this movie and ignore all the bad reviews it's getting. All these negative reviews are from people who have no clue what they're talking about and like to bash on comic book films. This movie was very entertaining and way better then the Spiderman 3 Topher Grace Venom which was down right garbage.,Venom
2301,thewadehome,Terrible. Just.....terrible.,2,28 November 2018,"If you've ever been a Spider-man, Venom or Carnage fan then do yourself a favour....just don't watch this. It's horrible, awful, pointless and silly. Eddie Brock is weak, the girlfriend is ridiculous, the bad guy is pointless and the plot is plotless. They have taken one of the most beloved characters in Marvel comics and dumped all over it. This is the Catwoman of Marvel movies. If you're going to create an all-new origin story then why not just create a new character? Terrible, just truly terrible. The teaser in the post-credits is the only reason it gets two stars instead of one, I'd really like to see Woody Harrelson as Cletus Kasady but not in this version of the franchise. Bin this, give the rights to Marvel studios and let's see a proper Venom in the big boy movies, played by somebody like Kellan Lutz (but not Kellan Lutz, someone who can act).",Venom
2302,mattmason1991,Tom Hardy saves the day,4,25 July 2020,"As per usual Tom Hardy gives his all to an acting role. Venom is also very well designed and animated. That's where the pros end.Everytime a Marvel film is set out side the MCU (and sometimes within it e.g. Captain Marvel) they destroy another of my favourite childhood characters. They did it with Ghost Rider and now they've done it to Venom. I'm sure some people enjoyed it but I, personally, found it clichéd beyond belief.If you want to make your own story, don't call it Venom, call it something else.",Venom

2307,larsdv1302,Even Tom Hardy can't save Venom,3,11 October 2018,"Okay, I'll be upfront about it: I heavily disliked Venom (2018) and I feel like it failed to be entertaining at all. This film to me felt like a slew of bad decisions, poor writing and unlikeable characters, and left me with an empty feeling after the credits rolled.Warning: very slight story spoilers below, nothing majorBefore I go further: I'm not an expert on the character of Venom. Before going into this movie, I knew I would be watching Eddie Brock being taken over by an alien symbiote that calls itself(or theirself?) Venom. That's all. Now, I did see Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3 all those years ago, so I was hoping this film would finally do Venom justice on the big screen. It did not. Without spoiling too much, we don't actually see Venom until the second half of the film. Instead, the film makes the same mistake as (for example) the 2014 Godzilla and decides to mainly focus on the humans of the story instead. This would not be a problem if the writing was any good, but alas, the audience gets the feeling like the script writers just threw something together and call it a day. For example, the phrase ""have a nice life"" gets thrown around a few times as if the film tries to make it a catchphrase of sorts, but this fails horribly. The tone of the film is also all over the place. Initially, Venom was set to be an R-rated film, edging towards the horror/action spectrum. Somewhere in development this changed towards a more breezy action film with jokes thrown around every 15 minutes or so. I feel like this really disorganized the film. Remnants of R-rated Venom still exist, but seem horribly out of place, as the occasional dismemberment feels flat and clean, as though it was toned down. Maybe the studio executives over at Sony saw the success of Deadpool 1 and 2 and decided ""hey, can we not just do this?"". It doesn't work. Approximately 90% of the jokes fall flat. I noticed myself breathing a little more air out my nose maybe twice during the film.But surely the visual effects and spectacular action scenes save the movie? Well.. not exactly. Most action scenes just kind of happen. There is very little emotional attachment to the characters, so the viewer doesn't really care for their fate. Moreover, the action scenes don't do very different things than other action films, even though the potential of Venom's abilities seemingly is unlimited. The filmmakers choose to resort to regular explosion- and gunfire filled scenes. Yes, maybe one or two nifty tricks appear in the film, but overall Venom feels underused. Shame, since the film literally bears his name.The best part (and I use the word ""best"" very carefully here) of the film is the banter beween Brock and his parasite Venom. Whenever Hardy has an inner monologue, I felt myself being intrigued and wanting more. Sadly, these scenes are very scarce.Overall, Venom was a movie doomed from the start. You would think that studios learned their lesson from the disaster that was Suicide Squad, but no, executives still get too much say in the process of filmmaking. Venom, to me, is a missed opportunity, and leaves me with no desire to watch a Venom 2.",Venom

2314,asenshugar,"Decent ""not Venom"" movie.",6,3 December 2018,"First of all ,i need to mention that i love spiderman and venom . So the main problem for me is that you cant have an origin story of Venom without Spiderman or without even mentioning him. That was the biggest disapointment for me .In general the movie is not bad , nice action scenes , the plot isnt bad for an action movie , and with nice CGI . But it isnt a venom movie , its more like the video game Prototype than then classic anti hero from spiderman . If you guys ever played that game , its almost like the story there , eating people , jumping arount , having tentancles doing your killing , it feels more like that , than a venom movie.I prefer to have a second spiderman cast (Hollands spiderman is too young for Hardys Venom) on the sequel than having Venom dealing alone with Carnage (i supose he will be next if a sequel happens) , that will be an awfull experience as Carnage is way to strong for Venom (in the Comics and even in the Animation series) .But in general if you arent a fun of the classic comics or even the animated series of spiderman and Venom\ Agent Venom , then you probably will enjoy it more than us .",Venom

2317,bilgivighnesh190,Just remember that you are watching for tge symbiote .,7,8 October 2018,"Just saw Venom , here's my take on it spoiler free ! :Tom Hardy plays a try- hard-to-be-funny character which has a lot of instances where it is Down right cringy and a some of them hilarious .His ""relationship"" with his girlfriend was downright rubbish ! Her role would have been much better as a friend rather than a GF.Carlton drake 's reason for procuring the symbiote is so bland making his character so one dimensional ! Also , it is no spoiler that the villain of this movie is also another symbiote. And venom's reason for fighting against his own kind is downright rushed !So the question is it worth the watch ?Answer : ABSOLUTLEY YES !The only reason the movie sells really well is for the love for our anti-heroic symbiote ! The venom character is the only thing that you came to watch! So if you keep that in mind , the above negative reviews can be given a pass !Now there is one mid credit scene , by now everyone knows 'cuz thanks to the internet !

2324,MariaF6,Maybe the critics watched some other film?,9,9 October 2018,"After finding out that the critics bashed the film and the rating was low, I was disappointed and unsure. However, my love for Tom Hardy and Riz Ahmed made me go watch this film, and I'm so glad I did. It was fast paced with an interesting plot and good direction. A worthy introduction to the scary but cute antihero, Venom. The action sequences and CGI were terrific, especially the last fight scene. The jokes were on point as everyone at the cinema laughed on cue.The acting was great! Tom Hardy played the role of righteous Eddie Brock brilliantly, where one would love him most of the times and at the same time feel frustrated at some of the choices he made. Him and Venom made the perfect yin-yang. Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake created the right menacing auro his character required, despite being a slim, harmless looking guy, he still managed to play the powerful villain role excellently.Michelle, as lawyer and Eddie's ex-fiance, and Reid, as her new doctor boyfriend, supporting Eddie were sweet to watch. Last I saw Jenny was in Parks and Rec so it was nice to see her doing a completely different role. Scott as Carlton's hitman, Wayne, Peggy and other cast were all good in the role they were given to play. Over all, the movie was not ground breaking 
by any chance and had a couple of flaws, but it was a fun fun ride, definitely worth the ticket and time. There's a credit scene guys, so don't leave!",Venom

You'll see in movie an unexpected comic book character for few seconds but it rocks. I am talking about Anne Weying who will bound with the Venom symbiote and become She-Venom and the first post-credit scene it will blow your mind seeing Woody Harrelson at Cletus Kasady in San Quentin Prison.

Actors are good, but I'm also a sucker for Tom Hardy.-CGI for transformations is cool and the symbiote moving by itself looks well done.
-I like the plot, especially for it being a solo Venom movie. However, I don't know how people are saying it's a ""break"" from the Marvel template. It's not special, and the general storyline is very similar to most MCU films.The Bad:
-As most people agree, this absolutely should have been R-rated. It's a dark character (which I feel like gets detracted from by near constant cheesy jokes), and there's even a scene where a guy's head gets bitten off that's so censored you can hardly even tell what happened. Making Venom PG-13 would be like making Deadpool PG-13. It's just not going to be as good.
Similar to above, I hoped for a much darker film. Childish jokes and scenes make this feel just too family friendly for a movie about a monstrous alien. Cletus is introduced, so I assume Carnage will be around if there's a sequel. If that's PG-13 as well, I imagine it will be a disaster. Sony went for something closer to family-friendly, which just makes me wonder why even make this movie if you want to release a lighter film? It just doesn't fit the character.The new Eminem song ""Venom"" was written for the end credits of the movie and it was super censored due to the movie being PG-13. I sound like a broken record, but why bother if you're going to have the lower rating?All in all, glad I watched it, even more glad I didn't pay for it.",Venom

Personally I had been looking forward to a stand alone Venom movie for almost 10 years and so the hype was greatly built up for this moment. 
The movie followed the usual Marvel storyline and eventually portrayed the vigilante as an eventual hero. Meh.
Giving Venom a comical personality as a character was a huge risk and I feel did not pay off, the symbiote would have been better if it was just able to change the hosts (Eddie Brock) personality rather than talk to Eddie and be seen trying to convince him to do what he says. However, in action sequences this worked well and added an air of comedy perfectly integrated in the seamless violence scenes.
Lastly and what bugged me the most, was the way Venom suddenly changed his mind from allowing a pathway for his millions of other fellow symbiotes to arrive on Earth, all because he felt he was ""a loser"". Unrealistic. Turning on your leader (Riot) and preventing a takeover of a planet all because of this was quite silly and a bit of an anticlimax from what was up to that point a good watch.
Nonetheless a reasonably well constructed movie with all the usual features of a marvel film, a base for a good sequel.",Venom

Even if you love SF and many of Marvel's movies this is somehow ""too much"" to bear. Tom Hardy is good but you can't make a s*** to shine regardless how much you brush it up!

This movie was an incredible and fun movie and I enjoyed it all the way through. Despite the pg13 rating the film did a great job of handling Venom and had r rated moments such as heads being bitten off and some blood. Tom Hardy did an amazing job at portraying Eddie Brock and you could tell he was giving this his all. This is Venom done right. Of course the movie wasnt perfect but it's a very enjoyable and fun experience. I hope to see A Venom 2 and further in the Sonyverse as they know what they are doing. THE AFTER CREDITS WAS DOPE BUT I WONT SPOIL THAT.",Venom

Boy I enjoyed every second of this film. Tom Hardy is not only funny but I can relate to him and his symbiote (not his parasite, never call him that) Venom! I love them both. Tom always plays serious and intimidating characters but in this movie, he is funny as hell especially his interactions with Venom. Now I am a certified Tom Hardy fan. There is no actor out there who can better portray this role. He was born for this role. The movie was a joy to watch, I got sad it finished too soon for me. I tend to ignore critics' reviews coz MY review matters most to me. I definitely will get the digital copy of this movie so I can watch it over and over whenever and wherever I want to watch. So for the ones who haven't watched it yet, better watch it now!",Venom

All in all a fun film worth a watch",Venom
2368,ClaraHaddad1,Venom review,8,11 October 2018,"Loved the alternation between serious and funny. How the movie starts in a serious way, how a man loses everything and starts living the life of a loser, but this routine is suddenly broken with comedy and change of mood, without missing the background story that keeps the viewer attached and that has unfortunately been lost throughout the latest marvel movies. This hero is different. He is not a good heroe and his powers Were imposed on him . he has a funny vulnerable side we can relate to because he wasnt strong like this before, he wasnt born with it like most superheroes. If you want different, action, character attachment and fun , Venom is the right movie.",Venom

2375,octoberthbaby,Venom - Pls Give Me Some!!!,5,10 October 2018,"The script was trite and predictable.It also was so miscasted. Williams looked so out of plsce and Tom Hardy truly is not a marvel character. Stan Lee's appearance usually is the high point. It wasn't this time. The movie started with a blast. The body snatching effect. But then it goes downhill with poor jokes in a boring script.  In one scene the voice who we the audience can't determine if he is good or bad originally is speaking to Eddie Brock and tells him he knows everything about him. Then when Ann (Michelle Williams) calls his phone.The voice asks ""who is that?"" Brock responded none of your business. Yet in the previous scene he told him he knew everything about him. The movie failed to connect the dots quick enough not to lose the audience. Action scenes is never enough!",Venom

I've read that the movie is ""boring."" Really??? Plenty of action here. And if the story did not follow the comics, I would not know that. It was a fun movie ""as is."" Stay for the credits!

2381,BarrieNormal,This film does the impossible,2,7 December 2018,"Yes, a film that manages to make Tom Hardy uncool!
I don't know how they manage it, maybe it's the bad writing, the terrible effects or the boring plot, but even the fantastic Mr Hardy can't save this mess.
The unbelievable villain, who's employees just go along with it when he suggests going from a failed test on an animal, straight to a human trial. ""yes just round up some tramps and let an alien species invade their bodies - that'll be fine""
I know it's comic book stuff but come on, the viewer has to slightly believe what's going on.
How this did well at the box office I don't know. Maybe Sony are paying people to go so they don't loose another character back to Marvel?
I love Tom Hardy and recommend you go and watch the BBC's Taboo instead of this tripe.",Venom

+interaction between eddy and venom

-forced love interest

I loved the humor, and I always love Tom Hardy, both for his acting as well as his good looks. I did think Michelle William's character was a selfish snot (how about supporting your fiancee and not moving on after a month you b***h), and the role belonged to someone else. She's such a bore, so plain, so blah. Bad choice. I also thought the last fight scene could have been better, but in general I thought it was such a good movie! Screw the critics! 😚",Venom
2386,adirindin,Better than the critics made it sound,9,4 October 2018,"Regardless of the critic reviews venom is a good film.
Its different to the other marvel films and i would prefer to compare it to the first movie in the dark night trilogy.

2389,copper_watermelon,A Rather Meh Experience,6,5 October 2018,"Before see this movie, I had the option of either going to the theater or finishing a five hour documentary and I somewhat regret choosing the theater.Overall Venom is not a bad film but it's also not a bold film either. My hopes when I first heard that there would be a Venom movie was that we would get a dark, gruesome, gritty anti-hero story where the writers wouldn't be afraid to show us some blood but this was far from what they movie gave us. I was disappointed by scenes where the symbiotses would simply ooze out of their rejected hosts and felt it would have been better if the rejection was more visibly violent. It also felt like a waste that there were multiple scenes where people's heads were bitten off but we never got to properly see it or even got any blood. Worst I think is the characters. Eddie Brock proves almost immediately that he doesn't respect his fiancee, as he gets into her email to get confidential documents that loses both of them their jobs and then has the audacity to be surprised when she breaks up with him, and yet it's implied at the end that they will likely get back together without him earning her back in any way. Venom as a character is played more for laughs than as a serious threat and even while eating a man's head, he still doesn't stand out as a truly intimidating figure, especially when he is casually bickering with Eddie about things like eating people. Anne is fairly forgettable and is far too calm in the face of seeing her ex turn in back from an ooze monster and the only person more forgettable than her is her boyfriend Dan who seemed important for the first half of the movie only to disappear three quarters in as Eddie and Anne race off the final climax of the film.Simply put, Venom is enjoyable garbage but garbage none the less.",Venom
2390,adamstressiz,What i just watched?,4,1 September 2020,I do not know who is like this movie but i know i do not. What is wrong with venom? Why he is trying to save world. Why? This is really confused and shoked me. And what wrong with Tom Hardy? He is horrible? He trying to be funny but he is not. Horrible acting horrible script.,Venom
2391,urbankolman,A fun and funny comic book movie (a movie that knows what it is),9,5 October 2018,"Venom is a fun movie. It definitely has some pacing issues, but otherwise it I liked it very much. The problem with reviews is that some people go watch the movie with their mind already made up, because it has no spiderman it must be bad. In their opinion it is not faithful to it's source material. If you see that in a review the reviewer is definitely biased. The last time I checked Star lord is not Ego's son in the comics and Thor is not a ""idiot"" surfer character. Hardy gives the most commited performance in a comic book movie since Ryan Reynolds in Deadpool. To summarise Venom is a fast paced action movie that is also quite funny (in my opinion it is funnier than ant man and the wasp and that was billed as a comedy). It the second best comic book movie of the year. Only behind deadpool 2. Why? 
Well it is funnier than Ant man 2(again a comedy). Black Panter is massively overrated (just because a MCU movie has a good villain and the movie has a second message does not mean it is the best comic book movie of all time). Avengers:IW is half a movie than will not have lasting stakes (yeah spiderman and Black Panther are definitely dead..and will not come back). Do not misunderstand me all the movies are good but for what a Venom movie should be in my opinion it hits it's targets.",Venom

It honestly is a good movie and worth going to see. It was funny, quick paced and so damn enjoyable. I just wish they had made it an R rated movie. How do you not make a Venom movie R rated?!!

The first act is a little boring, but still thrilling enough because of some stuff I can't spoiler, but it has to do with experiments. Act 2 is very very very very very good because that is when venom comes into Eddies body. Their ""friendship"" is super entertaining to watch and there are a lot of good jokes from both personalities. The third act actually fell short for me, just because the villain doesn't have enough depth. The end was one of the funniest parts of the movie so that is a plus.

Creatively, it's a bit bland and predictable. The score is beautifully made but does not fit the film for me. When you (cant help but) compare Venom's soundtrack to Thor:Ragnarok and it's rockin' efforts, you can't help but feel that something more along those lines would have elevated it.

It was. This film proves venom is a strong enough character without Spider-Man because venom has enough qualities to make a few entertaining films. In the beginning I knew this would be the perfect film as it was straight into the action and there was never a boring bit. Venom made enough of an appearance to still look cool, even at the end of the film, without being shown too much that he gets boring and the casting was absolutely perfect as they delivered a perfect enjoyable performance without being cringy in any way. The cgi was on point at all times and there were so many comic book appearances that they managed to cleverly fit in this film.

And i don't know if u guys think the same but i guess the movie's all abt some barbie dolls having a chit chat like just having a conversation between tom hardy and venom. The fight scenes were terrible. Like i said, most of the scenes contain chit chats and with not much explanation, there was a fight at the end, and an easy fight. Like there was nothing special abt the fight. And the animation was 👎Looks like a low quality animation especially the black thing the the venom usually spits. So the conclusion is the story doesn't really have a strong vision to carry on and make it a movie because he's neither a superhero nor a villain, so it's pretty confusing and makes ppl wanna punch their screen at home :)",Venom

2436,djaideep,Not so bad! Lot of scope for sequel!,6,7 October 2018,"Not so bad!
My rating:-2.75/5
 This is the only villain spin off i have ever most enjoyed. Lots were good. Some parts were bad. There was unnecessary chaos. Some parts were worst. Especially the climax. When it arrived, i thought 'Oh! So, is this the climax?' I was pretty disappointed with the climax. It could have been better. One more problem with this one is duration. It could have been more long. Because they could have taken more time to establish everything perfectly. So don't worry with this movie. It's just the first one. It will certainly keep you up interesting throughout. Tom and Tom's charismatic bromance with Venom literally saved this movie. If you are a big fan of spider-verse , you should definitely go for it, you will certainly enjoy it. If you are a marvel fan and you know a little about venom, you can go for it , it will be a decent flick. If you know nothing about marvel and spider-verse, then you should stay away from this, because what remains is lot of chaos. All venom fans wait for it, because when he will get out, there will be lot of carnage.",Venom
2437,fchantiko,Good picture.,5,22 January 2019,"I will be brief.
Tom Hardy does a very nice job. He drags this movie almost in solo. Other actors play is like ""could be worse"". BUT, exept of the greatest Tom Hardy this movie has a few more positive sides:
1) Venom himself ( funny and charismatic character with beautiful voice effects).
2) Perfect camera work and special effects.",Venom
2438,brockerekson-23892,A Venom worth watching!,7,7 October 2018,"Don't let the critic reviews make your experience ruined. Venom brings a very different and fun supervillain story to the table that people have never seen before. The movie is not only funny, but it is action-packed and a very engaging ride! Tom Hardy's acting in this movie makes it worth watching alone and it was thrilling to see his character struggle between Eddie and Venom. The flow of the movie and its plot was something that could have been better. I never found myself getting lost in the story because in the end I already knew what was going to happen. The villainous Carlton Drake was plain and simple. His character contained no background and I the climax of his character arc was brushed over in a short scene. As for Eddie and his fiance, I simply don't understand how a couple can go from living together and getting married soon to breaking up over a job. That's just lazy writing. However, most of the audience does not see that as a major issue. So, for the most part, it makes it an enjoyable movie that I would definitely watch again.",Venom

2442,drtinaferguson,A Fun Ride,9,5 October 2018,I wasn't really sure about going to see this movie. But my husband wanted to see it. I was pleasantly surprised! It was really funny. Tom Hardy did a great job acting genuinely surprised by what had overtaken him! Michelle Williams did a great job although her hair looks so fake. Best of all for me was the music and the action moving together. In the last few years the music in these films has been so disjointed and jarring that it has really impacted my ability to enjoy these action films. But this film got it all right! I am so grateful to see a good movie out of the Marvel Universe! This movie did not feel long at all... YAY!!! Stan Lee is one of my personal heroes and this movie did the MU justice! Can't wait to see the next Venom.,Venom

2444,paleorkphotography,It felt rushed,5,5 October 2018,To start of its not the worst movie I seen. It has some good stuff but the story did feel very rushed. It seemed that Sony was just looking for a quick cash grab. Who ever wrote this should be ashamed and Sony needs to stop making the comic book movies asap. I will not buy this movie when it comes out on. Seeing it once is enough.,Venom

2448,urayka,Lazy storywriting,6,24 November 2018,"I dont want to attack blindly and I hesitate not to appreciate the work but I felt like storywriting has insulted my intelligence as a wiever. This subject of having limitless and dark power had too much potential. There is the story of Faust, which is having absolute power and can not be able to find satisfaction even then, and there is Jung's shadow concept which is having capacity for evil when there is no moral rules which exceed your power... This Venom, symbiote thing could be used so well but all of the writers just used stereotypic, cliche lines and scenes instead.
That plot twist probably made many wievers happy including me, but how and why did that happen, was a lazy work. This is one of the exemples of sloppy job that writers made. There is even a lot more...
Tom Hardy's talent does not even require my praise.
I did not watch the movie with extreme expectations but I still feel for story of this movie could be written much better.",Venom

2450,gergokozs,Perfect!,10,6 October 2018,"The movie is fulll of action and fun from beginning 'til the end. In my opinion this movie showed a better Venom, than how we saw him in the comics. In the movie, he really was an anti-hero, while in the comics he was more of a villain. The chemistry between Eddie and Venom is really good and funny. If you haven't seen it yet, go and see it... Now!!!",Venom
2451,marcmillersite,"Very Entertaining, But Could Be Better As An 18",9,2 November 2018,"I love Tom Hardy. Haven't watched him in a bad or terrible film. He's always excellent and always the right person for that part. This film is without a doubt the same.He plays a good role of showing him breaking down and thinking he's dying when Venom takes over his body. He's likeable, bit of a d**k at times, but he plays the part well.Venom is just brilliant. Takes a while to see him. Came out of nowhere that he's a bit like Deadpool. He has some jokes that mostly hit. But when he comes into any scene he takes over.He also has Eddie's voice in his head and basically they begin to teach each other. Like the bit were Venom was about to eat a policeman, Eddie stopped him and told him no and described why. Same goes for Eddie with Venom's voice, going over all the things that they can do to help each other and help the world. It's a good balance that can be built on. It reminds me of Inner Space with Jack having Tuck inside his body and getting him to build on himself. I see that as a possibility for Venom.The major flaws with Venom is probably the length, the lack of information and story on Riot and the fact that it's not an 18.It seemed to just end too quickly. Riot comes in and takes over Carlton Drake's body and just begins the end plans extremely fast. He's got even more insane abilities like huge knives, spikes, etc. It just wasn't used enough and explained enough.The fact it isn't an 18 really gets me. I thought it would hinder the film massively, but it taints it slightly. I would love if they just went further than even Deadpool, make it full on body horror. People being ripped apart. I hope they go for that, because I've read into Venom a bit and it would be an amazing horror franchise. Easily.I know people don't like this film. I can see why. I was just thoroughly entertained and really enjoyed the whole experience.",Venom

The movie is not great by any means but i must admit it is one of the most entertaining movies that I have seen so far this year so much so that I have become a huge fan of the venom character even if I have not read the comics even once.Positives about the movie:
The chemistry between Tom Hardy (Eddie) and Venom is off the charts. It's funny and entertaining as hell. Can't remember the last time I saw a entire cinema hall burst into laughter at some of the funny moments in the movie.The soundtrack for the movie was good though not great.The post credit scenes were really good! Negatives
The villian is a bit full and boring and it felt as a case of wrong casting.The movie breezes along so fast that sometimes you wish it was a bit longer.The CGI effects could have been a bit better but heck I am not gonna criticize that as I know how hard it must have been to finish the VFX.Final advice: don't listen to the critics!

The action was perfect and not over the top. I will admit I was hesitant when I had seen the trailers and was crossing my fingers that Sony would do right by Venom. They listened to marvel and did good. I will admit that I wish Venom was a bit more darker and not so comical. Tom Hardy had good chemistry and plays his roles well and honest as did everyone. I hope and can not wait to see what's next. I give it a 7 for great acting, action and a well thought idea along with some good laughs.

2465,torstenoctose,"A simple, yet well executed film.",6,5 October 2018,"While I'm not here to spoil -- the ultimate downfall of Venom is the fact that the story is incredibly simplistic in nature. It doesn't toy with the audience between moral and immoral to a serious extent like other MCU titles -- it's incredibly black & white in its portrayal. While the story is simple, the writing is relatively well done; it's funny when it needs to be, slightly scary at some parts, but ultimately leads to a easy and fun watching experience.The action was quality, CGI very well done, and so on so forth. It's worth a watch, although not very memorable.I wish MCU devoted itself towards creating some very quality, stylistic films, but we'll see how they carry out the superhero ideals in the future. I feel it's just overall getting repetitive at this point.None the less, Venom was a fun and interesting watch.",Venom
2466,joey-64819,Better then I thought!,7,17 October 2018,"Going to the theater I was very skeptical because of the reviews on rotten tomatoes, But to be suprised it was way better then I thought.
Tom hardly was pretty good.
There were a couple of hiccups in the CGI where it looked really bad and you couldn't tell what was going on but I'll forgive it. The final fight was honestly really predictable. Just felt like it need something a little more but for venom's first solo film I would say this is a watchable movie.
The Tom Hardy/Venom Combo really work they both connect really well and I enjoy Eddie and venom going back and forth banter I wish there was more of it.
Do I think this movie need a sequel No,Would I like one,Absolutely! With a better animation team and better dialogue writing and more character development then yes. My finial verdict is a 7.5/10 my girlfriend said that she would definitely see it again. I will too
This is way better then anything Zack Snyder has put out and a lot of credit goes to the director who really knew what he was trying to do. So stuff just needs to be worked on in the sequel.",Venom

The comic moments are fluid and natural, without that fake mood and bad timing from, for example, DC movies. The photograph is dark, probably due to the rendering of the digital art, but nothing disturbing the film; even helps in some moments because of the sobriety of history and theme. The action scenes were well done; it is certain that some actors seem not very comfortable with the story, a dialogue, maybe, but Hardy took the role very well. It's not the Venom as we know, but it has the potential to get there.I really liked and there's room for Marvel to take advantage of multiple points in history to, who knows, insert it in MCU.P.S: Wait for the post-credit scene.",Venom

I had not even heard of Venom before I watched this film but decided to take a punt as it seemed like the only film we could all decide on as a family. Well, it blew my socks off!!!! Hooked from the very beginning. It's not a typical Marvel film at the start as it has elements of horror and doesn't have a heroic theme until further into the film but I was absolutely captivated. The jokes were funny, the CGI amazing and Tom Hardy is one of the most unvain actors around. Perfectly cast for this role and it really shows off his versatile acting skills. Marvel actors don't normally win oscars, but I would nominate him if I worked in the industry.
The only downside to the film , and this is only to balance out my critique is I found the actors not looking in the right direction when interacting with the CGI symbiote. But that was only in two scenes, the rest of the movie is flawless.
It's a great film which will entertain you and leave you with the biggest smile ever. Critics dont always get it right, and this is one prime example.",Venom

But once venom gets in the movie it becomes awesome, every scene with him is great. His jokes were funny but it did have a sense of humor that either worked or fell flat. For me i understood it but i can see how some people wouldnt like the style of humor. I thought the scientist girl was boring and her development rushed, like all because she has two kids we are supposed to care about her. When she dies noone seemed to care. And whem venom ""dies"" too at the end you dont think hes dead for a second. I thought the action was very good aside from parts of venom vs riot as you cant tell what the hell is happening because they look so similar. But i think the setup for Carnage is going to be very cool for a sequel and hopefully its done right. Worth a watch.",Venom

2484,maartenhulsmanimdb,A sometimes funny and silly mess,5,9 October 2018,"Something went very wrong in the making of Venom. It feels like it is constantly holding in to maintain it's PG-13 rating. You can almost pinpoint the moments cuts were made (the plan was to make it R-rated). It causes an unbalanced movie that is struggling to make it to the finish line. The dialogue can also be extremely akward and cliché. Michelle Williams is way to qualified for the role given and at some moments I would swear I felt her trying to keep it cool while babbling nonsense.Nonetheless, I was not always bored. Tom Hardy does the best he can with the given material and has moments where he made me laugh.
I read reviews where it was said that the action scenes where hard to make out, a lá Transformer movies. Where I can't handle the Transformer movies at all, let alone the action scenes, I did not have that feeling with the action scenes in Venom.

Why the hell wouldn't you of made it a Rated R movie? I honestly don't get it because they are leading up to the sequel with Cleatus Cassidy aka Carnage.

I can imagine them saying, lets expose everyone to enormous amounts of violence, in glorious colour, backed by music and sound effects, all in the name of good conquering evil.Then we can create all the wars we want, steal all the resources we need and paint other evolved cultures and religions as evil.Hum..........This violent boring vapid movie contains great acting from Tom Hardy but it is the relentless body count and violence that lets the movie down.Once upon a time, Heroes stood up for the weak, the poor, the undefended, they had a message to convey to the world.

The action parts were really good but to me they were not even the best parts of the movie (and that's coming from a guy who loves action) I gave it a 9 star because although it is really great, I didn't leave the movie feeling absolutely blown away by what I had just seen. It was just a really great movie, plain and simple! I definitely reccomend watching it!",Venom
2499,indytje,Very cool movie,10,27 October 2018,I like the movie a lot. There are nearly no boring scenes. O think they did a great job in putting venom as a lead character in a movie.,Venom

2502,darrobaldacchino-03922,IGNORE THE HATERS ... and just give this movie a chance.,7,18 December 2018,"I just recently watched this movie and all I have to say is that this movie is very well-made for many reasons:1.) The Plot.The plot of this movie is not complicated at all for any viewer. It's simple and has a fast pace but for a movie like this and of this genre, it works. Quite an original plot!2.) The runtime.The runtime if this movie is just 1 hour 52 minutes and it is quite short for a Marvel movie which makes it more watchable. Usually a Marvel movie has a minimum of maybe 2 hrs - 2hrs 15mins. Sometimes even 2 and a half hours. It is defenitely not too lomg fof this type of movie.3.) The cast.The cast of this movie is quite interesting in my opinion. Some of these actors are not as well-known as the main actor of this movie Tom Hardy a.k.a Eddie Brock/Venom.4.) Action.The action sequences in this movie are extremely more original than any other movie released in the past 5-7 years. The car chase scene of Eddie on his motorcycle is an absolute blast to watch and enjoy! The final scene will be very nice ti enjoy too.5.) The CGI.The final reason that makes ""Venom"" a great movie is the amount of CGI used to make the character. There is a huge amount of CGI used on him but that issue is overcome by the fact that the main character is VENOM. You can't make Venom without using a lot of CGI.My overall thoughts on this movie is that it is a great movie to watch with the family and friends . If you are a person who loves an action-packed Marvel movie lover than this is the right movie for you.Thanks!",Venom
2503,salaspaulaugustine,THE CRITICS SUUUUCKs,9,13 October 2018,"After seeing this movie I understand one thing that some times critics doesn't know how to rate a good movie. This movie had a good(7/10) story, awesome stunts(9/10) and more than that the combination of terrific bgm with joke like talks ofvenom(10/10) make us sit and watch the movie completely without any boring. And it gives as a good visual effects to In every way it was a fine movie for me. Please everyone go and watch this movie and make it successful",Venom
2504,davidmoynihan-39815,Struggling and slow,6,21 March 2019,It takes nearly 45 minutes for the real action to start and up to that point drags along trying to lay character and story foundations. Tom Hardy throws himself into it whole heartedly but still does not quite click for all his effort. The best moments for humour and action come from the Venom CGI scenes where at times the action is excellent and his remarks are funny but it still could not save this film from a shaky storyline and poor dialogue. I expected more from a the director and a film that took so long from concept to screen.,Venom
2505,karkisaurav-51584,one of the perfect anti hero movie!!,8,29 November 2018,"Venom is a very good movie. Tom Hardy is a sensation. Origin story is good but i found sth missing. hope they improve in the next sequel.For SONY:: there is a lot to improve!!!
Still 2hrs of awesome experience!!!!!
ENJOY",Venom
2506,nikolasmmunoz,DONT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS,8,7 October 2018,"This is a very entertaining movie. Yes it has some flaws like the villain is your standert preache type of character. But the action is cool and much like most marvel movies, the humor is a strong point of the movie. Overall a fun watch, definitely more of a brain fart movie",Venom
2507,tyler-45882,Just awful,3,20 December 2018,"This was one of the poorest, most awful films I've seen in years. I blame the director and whomever hired this mess of actors. It was just a disaster, so disappointing.",Venom
2508,mdunkley-24418,We Are Venom,9,7 October 2018,"This movie.....dang!!!! My wife and I saw this last night and we were blown away by how good it was!!! I have been a venom fan since I was little and honestly I was worried about how they would do the story of venom's origin and they did really good with it. They keep most of the same beats, replacing Spider-Man with the Life Foundation with taking Eddie down(on purpose this time) and it really works. This movie can actually get your skin crawling at times especially when Eddie first gets the symbiote and there were times were chills ran down my spine and it gets so much better from thereThe action is tense and you are glued to the screen, the CGI is really good and the relationship between the symbiote and Eddie just makes the movie just by itself, with some tense scenes and surprisingly really solid humor. The best parts of this movie are when venom goes all out on people. Also if you're worried about the brutality of venom since it is pg-13 they get away with a lot of stuff either by shading it or some other form of cut or something(and yes he does bite peoples heads off....several times.) it makes me wonder if they do have a unrated edition what the heck did they cut out if they were able to keep some of the stuff in the movie....gets me pumped honestly. This movie is great even if you read the comics seen the 90's tv show etc it will not let you down and ooh boy you are in for a ride don't listen to critics go see this if you want a fun ""superhero"" movie.",Venom
2509,ghoulbuggerer,Amazing film!!! Not too spoiler heavy in this review but just to be safe,10,23 December 2018,"I walked into this movie not knowing what to expect.
But I felt like I got slapped in the face by the fact that it was remarkably close to the source material!!!
For those of you that don't know, Eddie and Venom are in a romantic relationship in the comics. Yup. You read that right. They call each other things like ""darling, dear, and love."" It's strange, but it works very well in the comics and often times it is very sweet.
In the movie, Anne ends up carrying Venom to Eddie so that they can basically save the day. They kiss right as Venom transfers over to him. Could be explained that Venom knew how much he wanted her back, but at the very tail end of the film Anne explains that the entire thing was Venom's idea, this to me implying that Venom himself wanted to kiss Eddie. To be completely honest I would lose my mind if they included their relationship in the next movie.
So yeah, all of this to say that this was the best Rom-Com of 2018.",Venom
2510,nickweezy,Movie was Amazing,10,5 October 2018,Venom was an amazing movie. Amazing acting story/plot everything was amazing about this. 10/10. Post credit scene 100/10. Don't listen to the people who said it was bad. The people who said it was bad cannot be trusted.,Venom

Its a good movie to watch if you're down because it has one of the most funniest one-liners i ever seen. for me, this is one of Tom Hardy's greatest performance. It was entertaining though to watch him with Venom.NOW FOR THE SPOILERS: 
Mid-Credit Scene: I never expected Woody Harrelson as the Carnage though but i think if ever he will be great.Post-Credit Scene: Ok this gotta be the most surprising scene ever because it teases maybe the opening of the spiderman movie Into to the Spiderverse.",Venom

2516,alphasker,Venom,8,20 December 2018,Not for old people or critics. I suggest you watch it and not go by what critics say about it. Tom hardy over topher grace. I think venom was more brains than brawn so hardy was not a ideal choice but with that being said tom hardy is great in this movie and would like to see another one with carnage.,Venom
2517,xtremesherlock,I can't believe this film got below 30% on Rotten Tomatoes,8,5 October 2018,"Venom is a film that I deem 'good', not perfect but good. Just because it is not in the MCU does not mean it is automatically bad, I understand if it's the plot because the intro of thr film had me confused and unexcited for whats to come. But this film already below 30% on Rotten Tomatoes?! What hell people. Movies like Jurassic World: The Fallen Kingdom and Truth or Dare deserve ratings like that but Venom? Holy crap. For me overall: Tom Hardys performance was quirky but likeable, the villain was okay but unoriginal, plot was basic, romantic scenes were not needed, and the humor was enjoyable to listen to. 8/10",Venom
2518,anty-60762,Awesome Design and CGI! Story unfortunately nowadays not so important for the big Studios.,6,3 October 2018,I loved the Trailers and i was hoping for a good movie.When i watched it yesterday somehow i was feeling nothing. It was not that bad but it wasnt good either. Just a plain movie. Some good actions scenes nothing more. Nothing surprising. Nothing gritting.Thats the thing nowadays. The studios just wanna recycle herostuff and hope the people will watch it. When do we see innovative fresh movie again with something special.,Venom

2522,jaxsmalm,Incredible,8,5 October 2018,I don't know why people hate on this movie it was great actually.The one problem i got with this movie is the screen time of venom was too short for my liking but the moment they mentioned carnage at the Post Credit scene i got hyped for the next venom. Other than that this movie is great. Keep Up The Good Work !,Venom
2523,sazzyefc,Ignore the critics and lady gaga fans,8,3 October 2018,I believe this was a solid film with great acting and a good story. Only fault was that the fight scenes were abit busy but due to the character it works well.Tom Hardy was marvellous as usual.Worth the money.,Venom

No, that's not a spoiler cas that was confirmed months ago lol.When Venom fully showed himself I cried tears of joy. Idk, I may be biased as I'm a HUGE Venom fan (have posters all over my man cave, key chains and even an artists painting of venom). But I'm in love with this movie and absolutely cannot wait for the sequel.Please, ignore the critics. My wife is not a huge fan of Venom (does like Marvel though) and she said it was great.

2528,eneyovich,Did Sony finally succeed? Did Marvel succeed again? did did did...,8,5 October 2018,"Venom ... pg-13? Wtf ... The first thing I wanted to say but ... but it's awesome! I like this movie. Really. This is a cool film. Let's go in order. I must to say, I compared this movie with Deadpool 2. After the last one I left the cinema in ecstasy, with the thought that I must kick somebody's ass. Graphical effects were cool here, but... If the fights in the middle of the movie would seem to you incredibly cool, then in the final confrontation of two villains it was sometimes difficult to sort out (I hope that the duel between symbiotes is not a spoiler because it was shown in trailers before). Venum here is definitely better than in the last part of Sam Raimi's trilogy about the Spider-Man, so I prefer not to count graphics to the minuses. The Internet is already full of negative feedbacks about the script, as if it is too straightforward, too simple. I don't know about you, but I was going for an entertaining attraction, not a detective or a thriller, so I would not even pay attention to it because I didn't expect nothing surprising. In my opinion, the main thing that makes this film worse than last appearance of his colleague in a red suit from the studio Fox is it's soundtracks. When I was sitting on 2 part of Deadpool, I struggled with myself in order not to launch Shazam on my phone and find the music that was rising me to heaven. It was happening for several times. I still listen to some tracks. After watching Venom, no melody left in my head. Honestly, as soon as I got out of the cinema, I couldn't even remember whether there was any musical support or not. But enough about bad. Because movies are cool. And this especially. The pursuit on a motorcycle shown in a trailer was cool. Extremely. And I formulated it softly. Humor - I really enjoyed it. Here I made a positive parallel with the last part of the ""dead red pool"". I laughed a lot of times and people near me did the same. Well, and the main thing you need to know. If in ""Return of the Dark Knight"" Bane played his role without showing his face completely and often doing it only with his eyes, then he did not have any barriers here. Tom Hardy played his role with great passion. I would say he did the best he could, just an unreally awesome actor. And his constant dialogues with Venom are perhaps the best part of the film. They are built on a remarkable performance of the actor which was always interesting to watch. What can I sum up - the movie is worth watching, it's interesting, fun and dynamic, just what it takes after a hard working week. Therefore, people - hurry up to rest in cinemas with evil symbiosis during yours weekend. It's worth it...",Venom

2530,fdileague-62428,An Honest Review from a Fan,6,5 October 2018,"Consider me entertained, I enjoyed the movie, but man this movie had lots of flaws. For starters I believe that Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed were mis-cast. I'm not saying they are not talented actors, but they did not feel like they were a part of this world. Michelle Williams just had this I'm just happy to be here aura about her the entire film. I don't know if it was a director decision or not, but to NOT be horrified when your ex turns into a giant alien was a very odd choice. From that point in the movie she just seems to be ok with the fact that Venom is just part of the family. WEIRD.Riz Ahmed just never seemed to be a threatening figure, his end goals of repopulating outer space with Aliens fused with Humans, just laughable, it's not even logical. The character is based on an Elon Musk type figure that is asking questions and pushing boundaries. Halfway through the movie he's not even him anymore because he's been ""replicated"" i guess by Riot? So coincidentally they kinda have the same goals except Riot wants to fuse Aliens with Humans on Earth and take over.....also WEIRDThe first half hour was confusing and just seemed to be fluff to get us to the AMAZING middle hour. The comedy, the SFX, the action all led to a SOLID 2nd act that saved this move.Oh that 3rd act though. Of course this was going to happen, two slimy blobs colliding with each other in a visually confusing mess. It was harder to follow than Transformers. Venom now wanting to be the savior of the planet cause he likes this place.......huh? How about Sideshow Bob...I mean Cletus Cassidy at the end credits. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Are you kidding me? Whats more terrifying than a serial killer with clown hair. That's right, everything is scarier. To sumup, The 2nd act saves the day. This movie would have been unwatchable trash without the AMAZING 2nd act. The SFX and Action/Comedy leave you on a high enough to get you through the end of the film. Hardy is the only actor in this movie that fits, even though his mumbling through the 1st act was a bit odd for me. His scared, almost punch drunk take on the 2nd act is really great. Someone at Sony, Please make sure that Amy Pascal (and how is she surviving the #metoo movement) and Avi Arad never make a Spidey Movie again...Good, BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!",Venom
2531,macaulychegwidden,Better than any Spider Man film atm... Yes it is,8,5 October 2018,"It has been poorly reviewed because it didn't start with venom but with Eddie and the fact we don't get to see venom intill like mid film. They build Eddie as a character the ""human side of the film"" then introduce venom... Enjoy the carnage",Venom
2532,joelandersson-26179,A package of entertainment with not so bad flaws,8,5 October 2018,"This is a movie with great elements and some clearly lacking elements. It is fun and entertaining with great character quirks but there's a very noticable lack of emotional connection most of the time. You don't get to understand the characters much or why they make the decisions they make. 30 more minutes run time in order to develop the story wouldn't have hurt. This is a fun movie and if you're going to watch it with a critical eye regarding script writing and story telling you will most likely not enjoy the ride as much as I did. Tom Hardy steals the show and I found myself forgiving the movie for it faults at the end because the things it did great, it absolutely nailed. It almost felt like a mixture between a movie aimed towards chinese audiances and western audiances. I suppose it was just the right mix for my taste buds.I recommend this movie if you're out to get some dumb fun entertainment with badass visuals.",Venom
2533,joelandersson-26179,Dumb fun with obvious but not-so-annoying flaws,8,6 October 2018,"Tom hardy steals the show in this package of entertainment. 
The story lacks an emotional layer and the characters make choices without the audiance getting to know much of why they make said choices. The writing is pretty lazy at times. Despite these flaws I really enjoyed myself watching this. It does some things absolutely beautifully.Loved the movie but in a strange kind of way cause it's a strange kind of movie.",Venom
2534,croechance,Dream come true,10,5 October 2018,"After waiting for this movie for a while, I was beginning to get worried when the reviews rolled in and called it trash. However, I was set and determined to watch this movie. I am glad to say as a fanboy, this movie put my fears to rest. Tom Hardy's portrayal of Venom was exactly what you would want to see. It's got a horror feel to it, but Venom himself really hits home with his quirkiness. The action was awesome and the chi is good. I'm excited to see where this franchise goes, whether or not Spider-Man becomes a part of it. Venom worked as a movie.",Venom

Instead, they pushed a few boundaries for the PG13 rating and offered some toned down, off screen moments of violence which worked well. Venom is funny and Tom Hardy did some of his most entertaining acting I've ever seen from him. This film won't win any big awards, but it's a whole bunch of Popcorn fun that reminded me of what going to the movies is all about.

It seems like it almost took Tom hardy half the movie to actually become venom and was a terrible reporter in the movie. Also they really should of made it R cause of the 0 blood for a head eater anti hero. But for some good stuff. It had great action and graphics of venom and riot, also venom being humorous is very comic book accurate and a great way to start this many movie franchise that I hope continues.

The contrast between the 2 characters(Brock and Venom)was priceless along with the constant action and very interesting plot line. The villain was spot on and true to the comics. Tom Hardy's performance was out of the park stellar for Eddie Brock and I can't wait for the sequel...especially after that post credit scene.

Personally, I loved it. I thought that the last fight scene felt a little rushed, but other than that the movie had a great plot and some pretty good supporting characters. Some critics are saying that the movie needs spider-man, but I never once though of that wail watching the movie. I thought it was a great movie on its own. I would definitely see a second one in theaters, and the director set up the after credit scene to give access to a second film. The movie is so far doing great in the box office an I expect it to continue bringing in money for quite a while. If your into a darker toned movie with heroes or aliens, you will like it. A small touch that I like is how comedic several of the scenes are, and they are always in the right spot.",Venom

2554,nathancoats-48939,Flawed and Mediocre but Enjoyable,5,9 October 2018,"To avoid spoilers, I'll keep it simple. 
First, the negatives:
Venom was a tonal mess. Inconsistencies throughout. Couldn't tell if it wanted to be dark or funny. The first act was also pretty bad and dragged on for too long. But the worst thing was the script and dialogue. It got very cringey at times and was pretty bad. Venom's voice was also bad. The trailers sounded so much better. The side characters had some duds and weren't great. Riz Ahmed as the villain was passable but forgettable; as was the story. Also, the PG-13 rating hurt it a bit, but not as bad as people thought.
Now, the positives:
The character Venom looks good. His CGI was done well and so was the villain's CGI work. The character of Venom also was taken care of well. He was semi accurate to the comics and actually eats people as seen in the trailer. Tom Hardy performed well, and although his accent didn't work well he portrayed a scared, possessed man pretty well. The relationship between Brock and Venom was also good. The second act was a huge step up from the first as well, once Venom was on screen, the movie got into signs of greatness. 
However, it didn't fully recover. The third act was only okay and the movie overall was pretty mediocre. Definitely worth a rent on something like Redbox, but I wouldn't pay much to see this movie. It had potential to be great, but this PG-13 flick couldn't escape mediocrity.",Venom

2556,hellianna,Entertainment at its best,8,9 October 2018,"This is a very entertaining movie. Funny, good story, good action scenes. It's not going to be the best movie you'll ever seen but it is fun to watch and if you love Venom, one of the most badass and complex Marvel characters, I think you'll enjoy watching this movie.
Would it have been as good without Tom Hardy, it's hard to say. I feel he made it believable, funny and sympathetic.",Venom
2557,atomerlin-34394,Great movie just misinterpreted by the pretentious critics...,9,9 October 2018,"I loved this movie but i typically find most superhero movies to be far too cheesy. I see a lot of pretentious reviews where people found it to be ""tone deaf and bla bla bla..."", do yourself a favor and ignore people like that... in every aspect of life but especially when it comes to this movie. The characters were great (maybe the main bad guy was a bit wimpy to be considered such a threat) the way venom was done was awesome and the movie even had some good laughs... not the kind that give you chills because they're so cheesy like in some of these superhero movies. Overall I'd say the only thing I would have liked to have seen is just a bit more Venom but it was an introduction to the character and the series in general so I somewhat expected that... If you like the comics or the Venom character in general then you WILL like this movie.",Venom

2559,pyridium,The Feel Good Movie of the Year,9,10 October 2018,"Wow. No spoilers. After reading all the Reviews and negative
Comments I was torn. Do I waste my time? Is this going to be another boring Marvel movie? No. If you liked and appreciate the bad-assery of Blade 1, The Punisher ( specifically Dolph Lundgreen version ), Ghost Rider 1 or any darker type Marvel movie, drop what your doing and go see this, in IMAX. ; we watched in 3D, and will be going back to see it in IMAX. We saw it last night, my wife gave it a 7/10, and she is not into these movies at all! I gave it a 8.5/10. Yes it was PG13, and that was ok with me. It was a strong PG-13. If it was R, it might of taken away from the story and who Venom really is. Tom Hardy is awesome, and a solid actor, you feel for him, and get goosebumps. Venom is perfect. Better than I could imagine in my dreams.If you ever played Maximum Carnage on SNES you will go crazy for this movie. Watch until credits are over.We all have Venom inside us, a bad ass who wants to do the right thing. Do the right thing and go watch.Check me out on YouTube, my handle is BigDog",Venom
2560,ginomaximus,Better than what the critics lead to believe.,8,11 October 2018,"With all the negative reviews coming from supposedly well regarded critics, I was somewhat turned away from Venom, which is a shame as the film really stands on its own and is incredibly good fun. Luckily, I spotted some online youtube reviews from regular joe's and the feedback was highly positive and peaked my interest again.I caught a 4pm screening as I had some time to waste, not expecting much from the movie due to the before mentioned ""highly respected"" critic reviews. I was almost expecting Venom to be another 2018 ""Predator"" pile of trash. I clutched my seat hoping I didn't waste $15.Needless to say. The critics have no idea what is good honest entertainment anymore. Venom is fun. Enjoyable. Tom Hardy does a great job again delivering a character that is rounded. Someone I want to invest my time in and want to follow his journey. I couldn't help but smile at the father and his son sitting a few seats away from me, as the young boy laughed and tried to imitate Venoms voice. He was enthralled, amazed, laughing and loving his time with the movie. I could almost say his enjoyment was infectious, and I enjoyed the movie more because of some little kid having the time of his life. Very much relieved and surprised by the film. PS. I used to be a big fan of the Spiderman / Venom comics and animated series and am not phased by this new origin story for venom. I like that he is an antihero hero... if that makes sense. 8/10",Venom

2562,irrelevantimaan,"beautiful, bloody and brutal",8,12 October 2018,"I just came back from the cinema and am loving Sony's new take on the predated Spiderman 3 character. 
Hardy was brilliant as both the flawed journalist Brock and the anti-hero himself.
the director's almost harmonious blend of humour and horror really sings. Riz's performance as mad scientist turned philanthropist isn't innovative by a long shot, infact a huge influx of recent dc and marvel films have been churning out the thanos-esque altruistic villains, but there is something charmingly polished about his character in this movie that makes him interesting -especially when juxtaposed against the rawness of hardy's fallibly self-destructive nature.in other words its just a great film with huge potential in the sequels' Rome wasn't built in a day and neither will the SMCU

2564,reemagerashi,Watch with an open mind.,8,12 October 2018,"While venom is not for everyone, it's ingenious plot delivers the story in quite the package. With an interestingly suspenseful undertone, it manages to keep the grounded wit and humor that fans find amusing about the character. You have a likable protagonist and antagonist and you're putting them together. Strangely, you'll find yourself rooting for them both, all that with decently packed action shots and humor which has proved itself to appeal to some but not all. If you ask me, venom has given us an innovative take on the character, and admirable portrayal. Seeing the movie with an open mind will give you a refreshing taste of a different and unique anti-hero. Not to mention a great performance from the movies' main actor.",Venom

I already knew that as all Marvel movies, this one will be with the same plot - hero saves the planet. But what I really liked is that sense of humor. There was a ton of nice jokes.

2573,peteroglos,A solid origin story riddled with plot holes and inconsistencies,7,23 October 2018,"Having much hype over the new origin story of Venom, I went in with low expectations, and came out with a good, yet not amazing movie experience. Overall I thought the origin story of the ""parasite"" was well developed, a slow process but provided good tension building. I personally am I big fan of Tom Hardy (Eddie), especially his role in Mad Max, yet I thought in this movie his acting skills weren't used effectively, most particularly in the solo scenes interacting as a journalist and with the female lead. However, every scene with Eddie and Venom was pure gold. They bounced comedy off of each other perfectly, with many great comedic and fight moments, as well as a good development of their relationship throughout the movie. However, the vast amount of plot holes regarding the antagonist and the final fight scene made me leave the cinema confused, yet also eager to see the next film. Ultimately it was a good movie which I would recommend for someone to watch once released for the public on DVD and digital download.",Venom

Just amazing stand alone film. Cant wait for the sequel!",Venom
2575,Liam293,Venom is a HIT! But..,8,25 October 2018,"Venom was an enjoyable ride, with the build up of eddies story and good humour throughout and definitely worth a watch.
The film gave a surprisingly warm feel to eddies relationship with the supposedly dark and terrifying symbiote which wasn't really portrayed in this flick.
I know fans were expecting a dark gruesome story which die hards know so well. But it wasn't the case as this felt like a PG and was suited for a younger audience as well.Overall a great watch. Overhyped but nailing the box office and the majority of fans. And maybe the makers will take on board what people are craving for for the sequel.",Venom
2576,greyish_blue,Crap movie,2,29 October 2018,"Actually, yes listen to the critics. I feel sorry for Tom Hardy for being strapped to this piece of trash (but not too sorry considering how much money he pulls in). While superhero movies based on comic books can be fun, they're kind of the McDonald's of the movie world - not very challenging and mostly action with not much to think about, and Venom rates pretty low on the superhero movie scale. Even Tom Hardy's talent couldn't overcome a bad script with lame jokes and a boring formulated plot kept alive by special effects.",Venom

2578,klm-45789,Brilliant relationship between Venom and Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy),9,30 October 2018,Had high expectations for this film as people had been raving about how amazing it is and it didn't disappoint. Tom Hardy included his trademark sarcastic edge to the character of Eddie which brought some great humour to the film. May seem odd to have humour in a 'villain' type film but it definitely worked! Venom too has a comedy edge which makes for a great duo when they finally get together. In some ways Venom becomes the 'inside voice' of Eddie. The ending is brilliant and I was very pleased it ended the way it did (I won't go into detail so I don't leave any spoilers) but it was left open for a part 2! Here's hoping!!,Venom

This was super fun to watch, with a very dynamic progression of the movie with Eddie and Venom's interactions.If I had one complaint, it would be that the climax/falling action of the movie plot felt clumsy-- this movie comes across much more as an entry to Venom and Eddie's bromance than battling a misguided visionary, and the ""final confrontation"" felt a bit anti-climatic as a result.",Venom

In all other areas this film falls woefully short. In a world where the bar for comic based films is constantly being raised this is a big disappointmen. The storyline manages to be filled with cliché, and be so simple and predictable and yet have huge plot holes.
-Charming genius millionaire (conveniently) owns space ships and pharmaceutical company, turns out he's bad.
-guy who's down on his luck but still friendly and generous, he's our goody.
the 'but no one will belive us' moment.-building with deadly things in has woeful security, bad thing gets out.
-For some reason this private security company are totally allowed to drive their huge 4x4s, chasing dangerously through the city without a single cop in sight (also they bomb a load of sh*t along the way, but no one seems to mind)
-some drawn out exposition that repeatedly hits the audience over the head with exactly what is happening and drops some serious hints at how it may be resolved.
awww the protagonist.who was bad has changed, he isn't bad!ooohhh millionaire bad guy is still bad!good guy (alien) vs bad guy (alien)good guys win, but for several minutes you think one has died.-He hasn't died, that would ruin the chances of a (very heavily hinted at) sequel.
That's about it. Nothing about it even hints at being risky, inventive or imaginative. From what I've read quite a bit of this film was left on the cutting room floor to bring its rating down from an 18 (R), to widen the audience and leave it open to a Venom / Spidey face of in the future, but unfortunately what is left is something that feels like a rehash of The Incredible Hulk, not the best foundation for a film.Plot holes:The whole symbiotic relationship is a bit muddled, they need the perfect host to live, but also a large test tube will do? Also why do they 'eat' the host if they need them to live?Why does Riot want Venom to return with him?The simbiotes plan to return to their planet and bring back more, why didn't they load the first rocket with more? Why allow the first humans to capture them In the first place? Why not enter the first humans and then load up the first rocket?There are a number more but you get the idea.I know it's just a film, and when it comes to comic book and sci-fi stuff you've got to forgive a few leaps of logic, but for me there's to much to forgive in this film.",Venom

Hardy and his evil side trade insults. They get into slapstick fights with bad guys where Venom marionettes Tom Hardy's body like a puppet. They eat inexplicable amounts of tater tots. It's like if Laurel and Hardy were the same guy - and also one of them liked to bite the heads off people This is epically, fantastically weird stuff. The only thing stopping this movie from becoming an immediate cult classic is that it takes nearly an hour for Tom Hardy to go full Venom. If they'd trimmed 15 minutes out of this thing, cut right to the chase, and just piled on the Hardy, Venom would be unmissable Oh, that first hour. It is bad. Not fun bad. Not so-bad-it's-good-bad.

If you're expecting anything but a romping, chomping and relentless comic book to movie about one of the more outlandish creations from an era where Marvel comics still played it safe then this might not be your cup of tea as it's unabashedly chaotic, funny, dark, weird and absolutely a popcorn action flick to just indulge that action, action, action, stunts, stunts, stunts itch with no pretence of being anything more than what Venom is. As a Brit, I do tend to lean toward UK productions such as Dredd and this movie eschews much of the MCU formula and just blasts you full force from the opening until the close with a UK production crew and Tom Hardy delivering a Riot Carnage of a new origin story that had me grinning like an idiot as that's the Venom I imagined as a young British lad.",Venom

Moving onto the pros, I did enjoy Hardy's performance. He wonderfully portrayed the troubles Eddie faced while bonded to the symbiote.

2608,marshalljos,Tom Hardy and the great experience known as VEnom (2018),9,13 March 2019,"With the film Venom, the main character Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is an ambitious news reporter who exposes massive scandals and corporate corruption on his show. One day he interviews the most dangerous man in the world; The owner of the Life Foundation named Dr. Carlton Drake. A specimen of an alien known as a symbiote escapes and achieves ""Symbioses"" with Eddie Brock changing him and his personality and with his new found partner he sets out to end the corporation and Dr.Drake.With Venom the movie is such a unique one from its genre of superhero action movies from Marvel and changes the normal formula in this genre of it being a superhero action movie to a supervillain action which is one of a kind as said and in the movie from Eddie Brock's perspective. It makes it look like he is actually good and at some point in the movie saying how all villains aren't evil which I find really cool because people are so used to the superhero perspective they automatically assume the antagonist is evil and the main character isn't, but with this it spins it so that Eddie Brock and Venom do cause death and destruction, but for a good cause which is explained in the plot of the movie and it makes people think how we root for these superheroes and we brush off in our heads when they do cause death and destruction it is for the greater good.With Venom the part of my review being 1.7 missing is out 10 (I give it a 9.3/10)is the way that the movie does ""Movie Magic"" as in the protagonist escapes something in some ludicrous way and an example of this is when Eddie Brock is outrunning Dr. Drake's security teams that are driving ATVs and vehicles in the scene in the woods which I suppose could be a plausible perk of being in combined with a Symbiote but I'll let it slide my main thing is when he climbs the tree so fast the soldiers chasing him not know where he went even though they were staring right him the whole time. I understand that Movie Magic happens in most action movies to a certain extent with some of it actually having some logic to it, but I believe this is kind of crossing the line. Also, one minor thing is that the Cinematic shots of San Francisco are gorgeous the one thing is that I wish they had a little more of a touch to it like sprinkles on a cupcake. Another thing with this Movie Magic comes with little plot holes in the movie's plot such as Eddie being in a friend relationship and talking again when before the events of Eddie being with Venom they were not on speaking terms and their relationship was almost as if they had a restraining order against each other.In Venom the main reason why I believe is so good is because it relates to the comics. With this, some people don't like Comic Movies where it just shows stuff from the comics in movie form which I understand, but Venom does it differently. In the comics Venom is a very formidable threat to Spiderman which is exacerbated in other comics and movies like Batman and Bane being able to break Batman's back with this however Venom has shown a lot of the action that would make it seem like if a Spiderman vs. Venom movie were to happen it would create tension in people and this is achieved through the music and the sound effects of the film and how the music interacts with actions of Venom. Not only that, but the voice of Venom oh my god I love it I honestly couldn't imagine any voice better than the voice of Tom Hardy (who actually ironic voiced Bane in The Dark Knight Rises). The things that aren't in the movie such as the origins of Venom is different (as far as we have seen with the movie since the comic version is extensive) with Venom and the other symbiotes on a comet and was brought back by the life foundation while in the comics Venom is an alien that was created to protect the infinity stones and other things listed in the comic books and Venom got to Earth and bonded with Spiderman and the bonded with Eddie Brock. With this, though the core of the character from the comics is kept the same with an example being Eddie still a journalist whose life got turned upside down which is really good considering people enjoyed the comics during their prime. One person named Mason S who agrees with me on my stance who is an Audience member state: ""The ending was a tad anticlimactic probably due to them cutting 45mins of the movie to fit the pg-13 rating but otherwise a very good movie. Everyone is complaining about the script or the story or whatever (It's not bad at all), it is a comic book movie and fits the genre all most perfectly. This is truly a movie for Marvel/Venom fans.""Another reason why I would give Venom a 9.3 out of 10 is the acting and voice acting of Tom Hardy. I honestly couldn't imagine any other actor to play as Eddie Brock and the acting in certain events was amazing. The Voice of Venom by Tom Hardy was amazing with the deep, devilish voice it was perfect with the voicelines not being too cliche or the stereotypical voice of a devilish figure up to no good and actually having weight to the words said and my mind soaking it in like a sponge with water. One thing I found interesting with this is how the critics have reviewed the movie about the acting of Tom Hardy saying that he overacted his role and giving the movie a 29% while the audience giving it an 83% which is very odd because it pits the Audience versus the Critics. According to one critic named Stephen Garrett of the Book&Flim Globe saying that Tom Hardy a good actor was wasting his time in this like a cartoon character saying: ""It'd be nice to say that Hardy, a fine actor, is actually given a chance to act. But he's basically just a Looney-Tunes punching bag."" I personally find this untrue and derogatory while also giving the movie a 1 out of 5. One Audience member has made a review stating: ""Tom Hardy was the right choice for Venom, he nails it :-). The movie was fun to watch and clearly one of those that can be rewatched multiple times.""In conclusion, I recommend if you want to see an excellent example of acting or want to have nostalgia from when you were a kid or just wants to see a superhero action movie then Venom is for you to watch and is rewatchable over and over. Enjoy watching.",Venom

Until I watched Venom. I know, It's not basic comics, but I really start to love it! The plot is funny and quite gripping. I thought I watched it only 15 min when I realized it was 112'. I'm 100% sure that the best think on Venom (If I can say think :D) is Tom Hardy. People who maked this film really knew what's going on. I adore him at the other films and this one wasn't different. His humor, acting and calm face in various situations will make you laugh. I just need to add that I watched Venom 2 times seccessive. Big goal with comics for me.

I decided to keep watching for a little longer and I am glad that I did because the movie took a very nice twist. I don't want to spoil it but I ended up watching the entire thing and loving it.

Darker than the Dark Knight, hilarious split personality schizophrenic discussions between Brock and Venom, excellent action scenes, light on the romantic elements, and a true anti-hero in Venom.

2642,pritty-15908,Venom movie review,6,13 September 2020,"Venom is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with Spider-Man. The character is a sentient alien symbiote with an amorphous, liquid-like-form, who survives by bonding with a host, usually human. This dual-life form receives enhanced powers and usually refers to itself as Venom. The symbiote was originally introduced as a living alien costume in The Amazing Spider-Man, with a full first appearance as Venom in The Amazing Spider-Man. The Venom symbiotes first human host was spider-man who eventually discovered its true nefarious nature and separated himself from the creature in The Amazing Spider-Man with a brief rejoining five months later in Web of spider-man. The character has been featured in various other media, including animated series, films, and video games.
This film is very good and artistic. It was a super genius idea for Ruben Fleischer to direct a spin-off based off the most famous villain from Spider-Man. Not only did they bring him back as a villain like in spider-man but turning him into a superhero. Venom begins with a journalist named Eddie Brock who gets superpowers by being infected by an extraterrestrial symbiote which species plans to invade earth and nothing else you could expect besides Venom just going to killing around people more like in his super-villain routines.
Venom is a American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name produced by Columbia Pictures. Distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is the first film is the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters. Directed by Ruben Fleischer from screenplay by Jeff Pinker, Scott Rosenberg, and Kelly Marcel, it stars Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, alongside Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, Scott Haza, and Reid Scott. Venom was released in the United States on October 5, 2018. The film was a box office success, becoming the seventh highest grossing film of 2018, with over $856 million worldwide, and set several box office records for an October release.",Venom
2643,alexelmasterd,What To Expect,6,29 May 2021,"If you want a Venom accurate movie or even a slightly comic inspired movie don't watch it because you're gonna hate it with all your soul.If you want to see Venom and the reinvention of the ""Venom Related Characters"" in a ""Spider-Man free environment"" then this might be your movie.It's way too fast so a lot of scenes feel pretty rushed, you may miss some Sonyverse lore and you ALSO even may miss some Venom 1 lore, the story focuses a LOT in the principal character and not enough in the plot nor the secondary characters. That's complicated because most of them are pretty charismatic; but if you hate one or more of them you won't be able to deal with this movie.",Venom
2644,nasaniw,Good Movie,8,9 October 2020,"I always liked the Venom series. If you're not a fan, then I don't think you would fully enjoy it. The movie started off a little slow but once Venom really became active, I feel that's when the movie began.The jokes worked good as long as you could catch on to them. If anything, the CGI was amazing and there was just enough action to help cary the movie.I liked how they slowly introduced the second ""parasite"" as it made it's journey to the rocket. Each host it bonded with, seemed to take to it better than Venom took to his first few host. The way the second parasite revealed his true form would have caused me to pee my pants. He looked more intimidating than Venom.Thank goodness there was no damsel in distress like there is in typical superhero movies.Overall, the movie was funny with a side of action. A movie I would sit down with the family to watch.",Venom

It's fricking ridiculous. Second of all there are no good fight scenes like in the last part the fight scene was short and a chunk of it was the to symbiotes fighting each othe as blobs and it honestly looked stupid.

During pre-production on that film, the creative team decided not to include the character so they could focus on introducing the protagonists, Eddie Brock and Venom.

It is a good film and well worth watching. Definitely has the potential to be a very good series of films.Tom Hardy is a good choice to play Eddy Brock, his skills aren't exactly pushed but what he does offer is natural comedic timing, coupled with his usual blend of 'rough suave'. The creature 'Venom' has some great lines and hope this continues to develop in the following films.The other actors within the film, Riz Ahmed, Michelle Williams are both good within their roles, Mr Ahmed, plays his character with intelligence and artistic value, it is a slight shame that this wasn't developed a little further. Ms Williams, offers a decent portrayal of the love interest and again, like Mr Ahmed, could have been given a bigger position within the movie.Personally, feel the film suffers from trying to fit within a time frame and much of the story was left on the cutting room floor. Could have been a full 9/10 instead of the 7/8 if the story had been further expanded but still a very entertaining watch.",Venom

2666,zmxbcvgq,"Solid Movie, Though not what one would expect",8,14 August 2021,"This movie is, in my opinion, a very fun movie that manages to stay true to the source material while still doing new things for the character. Venom manages to tell a compelling story of the dark mirror of Spider-Man, while managing to cut out Spider-Man entirely. I feel that this heightens the movie, making Eddie Brock more than just the reporter trying to get vengeance on Spider-Man and Peter Parker, instead making him a more complex character who doesn't really care about vengeance. Tom Hardy's performance of the character is perfect, and I believe he bails it as both brock and venom. Can't wait to see the sequel, as I'm sure woody harrelson will do the same as carnage.The movie is not without its problems, as it is quite slow in the start, but once it starts, it starts.

I found it funny, action packed and brilliant. Yes maybe an R rating could've improved the quality of the movie, but it would just have been icing on an already amazing cake. Also, with this rating I get to take my son for the movie :)
Tom Hardy is perfect as Eddie Brock. He manages to capture the character's loser attitude, his quirky nature, and his reaction to the symbiote perfectly. The action is brilliant and Venom is renders perfectly in CGI.

2700,omicojoric,Losers and Winners,8,7 October 2018,"Some reviewers wrote that the plot is not as good as the acting or the action. I do not agree, especially because the movie is a hell of a ride during almost 2h, and it would have been probably too long if several ideas were fully developed. Which is also the weak point of Venom, though.As a faithful Marvel product, the movie contains the undying themes of overcoming humanity -for the best of all- and the fall into self-righteousness and last proclamation of divinity -about this, remember the psychedelic dialogue between Drake (god) and Isaac, a poor soul who has nothing to lose. Despite the cliched parts, the original point is about the concept of loser and winner. Brock is not an obvious loser, who plays dirty to defeat an obvious winner, Drake. And Drake is the real, actual winner, and here comes the message. Nowadays, being a winner means being fluent with all the themes about disruption of society, the environmental, egoistical, irrational let-me-tell-yous, and also with the good ones, of curiosity, understanding, imagination. Obviously though to become the real boss you have to fall into ambition, self-proclamation, ruthlessness and lust for power. So much that only losers come from another planet can do something about it. Nice, but here the weakness comes. Why Venom changed his mind? It cannot be that simple, just because it is a loser like Brock. Is it redemption, is it opportunity, is it another kind of ruthlessness? The movie does not develop its best part. That is why it is just an action movie and not a perfect one.About action? That is great, probably one of the best since Deadpool, and in fact it takes several hints from that franchise, especially the funny moments and the effects during the last duel between Riot and Venom. Which also reminds of the action of Prototype, a cool videogame of 2009.Special effect and music, over the top, with moments reminding Inception, Life and Antman. So, derivative? yes, but not from obvious sources.All in all, a nice experience, good for the eye, light and funny, not as deep as it could be.",Venom

2705,davmoya4617,Don't Believe the Critics,10,5 October 2018,"This movie is near perfect to who and what Venom is. The movie is held together by the performance of Tom Hardy as Venom and Eddie Brock. Which is all this movie is really suppose to provide. If you're unable to find the tone of the film, it's a Dark Action Comedy. But it's so fun and exciting that I felt like I was Eddie just kinda along for the ride. The movie could have done better with an R-Rating. There is no doubt that, some scenes felt a bit awkward with the lack of violence or gore. Especially because that's who Venom. Regardless, it stays true to Venom is which is dark, funny and inappropriate. Similar to who Deadpool is. The only real problem I felt with this film was that it needed to be longer. Only 1 Hour and 52 minutes wasn't enough to dive in and flesh out the events and characters of the movie, which led to a really fast paced movie, which is great. But for this movie, it's too fast. Things are constantly happening and the story is progressing along so quickly that we didn't really have the time to watch Venom and Eddie really bond or create a relationship.Otherwise, this film is so fun. I can't wait to see it again. I highly recommend seeing it, especially with the predictions of a sequel. That's something I know people will be wanting to see. Please go see Venom. Turn off your brain and just appreciate it for what it is",Venom

There weren't too many jokes so the humour was just right and not too overboard like most of the new superhero films are nowadays. The movie also had a serious edge to it giving it the chance to stand out from the typical superhero type of films which we're all used used to. It also had some great acting on behalf of Hardy.

the scene were he was being chased it was so obvious that he's running at 30-40 KM/h which is a mood killer ( you have a bike for crying out loud ) and it couldn't be covered by directing !",Venom

2715,jacob-steinschlag,"Funny as hell, horrible credits & afterscene.",9,16 October 2018,"We enjoyed the movie a lot. So much to laugh. So many ridiculous twists....But seriously, what was marvel thinking when they made the credits?! First, the letters are like 3x bigger than normal credit-letters and then they're moving at the same pace of the 3x smaller letters which resulted in credits which took 3 times longer to end than any other credits I've ever seen. So we waited for a very long time just to see the most lame after scene ever? Some weird spiderman-short-story with absolutely 0 content and 0 humor? It looked like a high school project to be honest.Conclusion:
I would've rated this movie a solid 10 but this is the very first time I had to deduct a star for these horrible credits and amateur afterscene. Shame on Marvel for that.9/10",Venom

2717,skymir,One of the most refreshing and fun-to-watch origin story (ignore the critics and see it yourself),9,5 October 2018,I went into the movie without much expectation with a few friends and was then really surprised. The movie has everything you could wish for and is surprisingly tough for its age rating. Venom & Eddie are a great team and the conversations by both are comedy gold. Wonderful fighting scenes and graded CGI make the movie almost perfect for me. I really hope the movie makes his money so we get a second part.,Venom

What it isn't is fantastic however.-buildup. The intro of the movie was fine. Nothing spectacular but certainly progressed the story into the right direction. Though it did linger on for a tad bit too long.-The plot while amusing, is definitely lacking and drops the ball at least at a certain point, which i cant really dive into here due to spoilers. This certainly is the biggest problem with the movie. -CGI. Not great but certainly far from bad! -Venom. The symbiote is awesome and i loved the bonding with Tom Hardy's character which truly moved the movie forward. Definitely the strongest point within the movie and was eager for more!-Overall. Ignore the damn paid critics. They are a dying breed and shouldve been put out of their misery years ago. This movie is entertaining. While i was dissapointed with the lack of a true dark tone, it wasnt all pure comedy either. it was a decent balance.Check this movie out for yourself and vote accordingly. This movie deserves that at the least.8/10",Venom
2719,jacster-987-49895,Thoroughly enjoyed it,7,5 October 2018,"Ok so after reading the initial reviews I thought I was going to be disappointed in Venom. 
Being the first movie, yes it had to lay the groundwork to establish the characters, and yes it did lack the development here and the CGI was a bit chaotic. 
Was it as good as the avengers, No. But did I enjoy it, Yes! 
Tom hardy was brilliant, Michelle Williams a little wooden. 
It was action packed, and funny. I wish it had gone for the R rating and been that little bit edgier. If Deadpool can do a PG version for Christmas then I hope the DVD release of Venom has an R rating release. 
Am looking forward to the next instalment. 7/10",Venom

2724,saad-straffire,Tom Hardy is excellent,7,5 October 2018,"There is a confusing tone, and a lot of underdeveloped story arcs and the usual plot holes, but I would tell you to watch it for Tom Hardy's performance alone. The action was solid, the visuals and production were pretty great. Riz Ahmed was great even if he was a bit one-toned, but the story doesn't do justice to the rest of the cast beyond the central Brock-Venom pairing, which I actually thought was quite compelling and pulled out a lot of unexpected laughs. I thought it toed the line well in terms of its rating, and in light of what Tom Hardy said about his best material ending up on the cutting floor, I would love to see what an R-rated version would have looked like.",Venom

2726,wisse_stolk5,Great actor wasted on patty plot and co-stars,3,9 October 2018,"With all the anticipation around the release of Venom, I was extremely keen on watching the movie in all its glory on the big screen. After suicide squads deception, I was very exited for a good antihero movie. However, still this wish has not been fulfilled. Venoms plot was so see-through that I knew exactly what was going to happen in the first 5 minutes. We get introduced to some problems in tom hardy's life. He gets infected, deals with some easy problems before facing the big villain, and after being the underdog, miraculously wins with the help of his pals. This is exactly why Infinity War stands apart from all these other movies. There is an intersteng character development, twists in the plot and an villain with an actual purpose. I mean, I kinda get the idea of Venoms villain (what was his name?) motive, as they want to live on the bodies of earth and thrive here (after writing this im not sure I actually do though...). But really, what is Venoms motive for saving the world. His explanation is that he likes tom hardy and started to like earth? But why? What underlying reason is there, what carter development supports this?Then there are the many inconsistencies in the film. Venom first states that he knows everything tom hardy does, but at one event has to ask Tom Hardy crucial plot details as a way to tell the audience. Then there is the issue of the villain travelling to SF for what exact reason? because he knows there is a spaceship? Which they don't have in India or other closer countries? Or the fact that Venom knows that Tom hardy should not open the door in the first venom scene, however lacks all these spider-senses in the next when he crashes in to a car during the mandatory action movie car chase. Well, I could go on and on, but you get the point.I'd like to finish by discussing the quality of acting. Although the movie does not allow for any character development, I do think we should give Tom Hardy some credit for portraying a flat and shallow character in a decent manner. However, especially his costar and ex lover was an atrocity to watch. All the lines, however badly written, were delivered without any emotion and with the sole intention to get a laugh from the audience. She actually seems like the real villain in this movie. Lets quickly analyse: She leaves TH without having evidence of him breaking in to her computer. All the while she was informed about the Life corp's wrongdoings and didn't do anything about it. She dates a nice surgeon (golddigger much?) who actually is respectful towards TH and even helps him. Then she goes and cheats on him again with TH and waves it off in a joking manner.. Want to wake up next too crazy?Final recommendation: Watch this to be able to critically judge other movies and see all the cliches to avoid in a summery of 2 hours.",Venom
2727,susantbista,Chemistry between Eddie and Venom is more than you wish for.,9,5 October 2018,Definitely a re watch for me. It was very different from MCU movies.

The car chase scene in SF downtown and chinatown was pretty cool. Tom Hardy was a good casting choice. However, the script is jaw-dropping bad. Most dialogues are a huge cringe-fest almost as if the screen writers tried to make sure everyone in the movie does not act, react or talk like a reasonable person turning a would-be blockbuster into a cringefest.Now that I watched it.

The romantic dynamic was wierd, the humor a little off-putting, and too much off screen violence without much payout.

2735,Jdeluca87,Stop Comparing this to the other Marvel Films!,7,28 October 2018,"So many of the negative reviews this film earned from critics came from a place of comparison to the MCU. One of the reviews said that Venom isn't fun compared to Thor Ragnarok. I happened to find that entry to the MCU to be too childish. Too many forced jokes, and a serious lack of danger for the characters took me out of the film. Venom doesn't need constant one-liners, or surprise jokes to be entertaining. This film shows that Marvel films can still be great outside Disney control. Tom Hardy does a great job of balancing both characters as Eddy, and Venom. I've seen this movie twice and will be picking it up when it releases. Their is so much potential in this new Universe. Carnage is coming, and Spider-Man will fit perfectly here.

Really tired of these super hero movies trying to incorporate way too many elements.Venom went from an E.T beast to a domestic pet. I'm really confused as whether the production wants me to fear him or be his BFF.And the reactions among the characters don't even make sense.

If that's your vibe you're not going to have a fun life or movie experience.Venom is fun and since I'm not looking for flaws and want to be distracted from my looming real world dystopian nightmare I had a blast enjoying this movie.Here's my take on Venom introducing Eddie at a dinner party: ""This is Eddie. He's a loser. I love him.""Eddie and venom are your loser douchy friends who know they're losers but are actively trying to get better and enjoy their life. Except that one is a killer symbiote with horrifying dental work and a wry sense of humor while the other is a bit confused by life but can still crack a wry joke.So yeah.

Want to see the following ones.I was surprised by the critics and their reviews and all I thought was ""how the hell Marvel Studios associated with a movie so low rated?"" . Now I know why!

2748,oliverreichelt,I want more,8,3 October 2018,"This movie sure wasn't made for the critics, so: ignore them.
This was made in the hopes to create a Villain Anti-Hero. That succeeded and makes me want more: more of this movie (about 40 Minutes!), more Tom Hardy - Venom discussions, more exploring the dark underbelly of the Marvel (Cinematic) Universe (there must be more Billionaires with agendas out there), and, eventually, more Spiderman.
Well done, Sony. 
Go for R rating, and you'll be fine.

2750,gordon-android-garrecht,so many high expectations,4,29 November 2018,"...which were not met. As a standalone movie useless. Effects you have seen dozens of times and a dozen of years ago, the story itself is just horribly conveyed - I do not know any previous history let alone comics about the character, granted that. But the whole thing would really only make sense as a mediocre attempt for a first installation, in order to set ground rules for future sequels that would then - hopefully - make more sense of this symbiosis and its treats as an addition to some superhero/anti-hero verse.
On its own, to me, disappointing story-wise. After the show, the same nagging feeling you have with a first season being too short of episodes on top, that leave you frustrated with the revelation to be dependent on general reception / quota if there will ever be a season 2. This is not what cinema is supposed to be.
4 stars simply for the popcorn element, but I am really inclined to rather 3 for the disappointment in general.",Venom

Is it a strategy to draw more attention to it? Who knows! But I am for sure that's the truth... I've seen worse movies who had at least 50 points from them.
Still, it's not the best Marvel movie out there, with Black Panther being the best and probably the greatest surprise that MCU has ever given to us, but it was enjoyable and I was really impressed with the portrayal of Venom, considering the story in the comic books. SPOILER ALERT: there's a lot of schizophrenia in this one :))",Venom

It's a shame alot of people disliked/hated this and gave it low ratings, and the amount of people who hated it ""just because others were too"" because it was a really fun film to sit through.Tom Hardy played his part great, his style of acting and from what i can only assume is improvisation in scenes made it even better. he is an absolute genius on screen.Movies plot wasn't anything huge but i think that helped, didn't throw too much to the audience, yes there was a few continuity errors but every single film in existence has them so people who judge a movie based on that need to wake up and accept nothings perfect. (rant over)I won't spoil anything though, theres alot i'd like to bring up but nope.if you haven't watched this yet, go in with an open mind and just enjoy a fun one. i'ts worth it",Venom

Studios need to do that less, especially in comic book movies.
++ Tom Hardy
+ The score
+ The best Venom on the big screen
+ Motorcycle chase scene (Adrenaline rush)
Some CGIVillainOverall, I think the critics are too harsh on the movie.
Venom's next installment should have an R rating.
Tom Hardy absolutely nails the character and his interactions with Venom are the best part of this movie, it would be mind-blowing to see this Venom with Tom Holland's Spider-Man in the future.

Could have been longer. Cgi wasn't quite top shelf.Pros: Tom hardy. The character of venom. They took time to develop Eddie. Riz did well with what he was given. But most of all, I just loved the film too much to care about it's shortcomings!As a 20+ years fan of the character, this film was pure wish fulfilment. I didn't mind that it wasn't R, they pushed the rating pretty far. I don't care that Spiderman wasn't in it, there was enough hints at a past life in New York to do flashbacks in a sequel if they work out the rights. There was even a time jump in there during which they could fit the black suit story, so long as the symbiote ends up back at the life foundation once rejected by Spider-Man.Objective rating: 7.5
Rating from a Venom fan: 9!",Venom

2774,kitokp,Not worth the time and money,3,6 October 2018,"Let's start with the fact that everyone agrees, in this universe at least, you can't have a venom origin story without spidey. The entire movie itself was just awful, from the acting to the plotline. I felt as though it had an identity crisis, it didn't know whether it wanted to be Deadpool with its humor and sometimes grisly scenes (I'm looking at you Justice League) , but stopped short of actual violent gore or if it wanted to be an lackluster spider-man. 
I'll I'm saying is Sony has tried and failed on numerous occasions with spidey, I mean spidey 2 was great, but that was over 14 years ago and the only taste in my mind is dancing black symbiote Toby and a fat guy in a rhino suit from the AS movies. 
I just think the head honchos over at Sony should take a page out of the previous people in charge and do what they did with Spidey and give venom and all the other characters to Marvel to work their magic. I mean at the end of the day isn't all about the bottom line for them anyways? At least this way it's a win for Sony and Marvel (Disney if you're so inclined) because for sure it will make boocoo bucks and it's a win for all of us because we know Marvel will do their characters justice.",Venom

Becuase of the reviews, I went in feeling so bad that I was going to waste 2 hours but was plasently shocked. It was funny, had great action, really good acting from Tom Hardy. It kind of reminded me of the good old super hero movies like the original hulk, iron man, and even toby meguiars spider Man trilogy, when things were kept simple and intimate to the few essential characters without stupidly super expansive cgi universes and appocaliptical overcomplex fights with a million things happening in a scene that last 30 minutes. I loved it, but am so disappointed and amazed that a movie like this gets a 35/100 by ""critics"" yet something like black panther gets 80+, what the heck is going on?

I love the MCU, and I give the DCU a chance to redeem themselves. This movie was great as it hit a funny aroua throughout the movie. It is definitely no Deadpool, but after all nothing can top Deadpool. As a movie lover of all types, this was very enjoyable to watch and can easily be better than some of the previous super-hero movies. Hell, I can say this is better than the second Thor and as many might not like this, but easily as good as Ant-Man. Yes it has the typical same villain with the same superpowers, but that's what the story is based from. It is sad that Spidey isn't appearing throughout this Sony universe, but as a stand-alone movie with a sequel and maybe an extended universe, I can see this going pretty well. Anything at this point can beat the DCU, however, Shazam is looking pretty good.",Venom

Them alone in the movie would be funny. The dialogue and delivery between them is spot on and I hope for more of it in the sequel. It could have been R rated, I agree with others. While it hints at gore it doesn't show enough of it to make us want to turn away. That's what it is lacking for me. Don't half do things, the film portrayed Venom as human ripping alien and didn't follow through. So get it right next time I say, go full out make us look away squeamish gore.And if there exists a Venom symbiote out there in real,life. I want him. That's how good it was.I've never listened to critics, never will. If we did listen then we would have missed out on some great films through the years including this one.

Well-balanced between plot, action and dialogue. Jokes were well placed and the overall movie was just great. There were some things that were obviously not thought out but I won't spoil it because it didn't spoil the movie at all for me. If you're on the fence go see it!!

I enjoyed Tom Hardy's acting and his character's relationship with Venom, ideally I would have liked the two to have come into contact a little earlier in the movie. I need to give it another watch, but it didn't feel like there was an awful lot of Venom in the movie, I guess you could put that down to Brock and Venom being kind of the same character. The story felt very generic and quite slow to start off with, it's a typical marvel story but it felt rather boring at times.

The main villain riot was playing hide and seek in different people 90% of the movie. I also love that venom at first was like ""I want to eat everyone and kill all humans.""

I love the fact that Sony put a little bit of comedy into the Dark Character of Venom. Although I do agree they could have done and shown a lot more if it was Rated R I can also understand that Sony is trying to advertise too the young audience as well. I don't believe it deserves the ratings that critics have been giving it and don't understand how they could have not enjoyed it. I personally would give it a 8 or 9 but I felt I should give it a 10 due to all the harsh reviews for a movie that is above average in my opinion.",Venom

The tone throughout will keep you engage. One moment it might be a thriller, the next an action packed scene and then onto some funny banter between Eddie and Venom. This Venom is inspired by the Lethal Protector book. In the book Venom is trying to protect innocents while still killing and eating the bad dudes. Venom's personality in the book is very cocky, brash, immature, and angry. His portrayal in this movie follows that similar style. It isn't over the top or too much but fits perfectly. Anyways, if you are a fan of Venom, mostly the Lethal Protector characterization, then you will greatly enjoy this movie. Ignore the critics!",Venom

2810,masonmershawn,Fun Movie!,4,8 October 2018,"I'll be honest, Venom itself is not a good movie. Potholes galore, Bad writing, shots that could have DEFINITELY been shot better. This is not a good movie by any means of the imagination.The characters, for the most part, are the best part of this movie. Tom Hardy plays a very interesting and good-moral character that seems to stick out like a sore thumb. Most of the characters in the movie are set in a darker light than the protagonist, which really makes you root for him. The actual relationship between Venom and Hardy is what sold me on this movie. Venom is portrayed as a VERY unique character but the movie NEVER EVER gives him enough time to understand his character more. Venom is treated more like a plot point than literally the title character of the movie, despite giving him a lot more personality. They ALSO didn't give him this personality towards near the end of the movie. The choices and descisions based around Venom's character were rushed and it seemed like in a short timespan he decided to do something that he definitely wouldn't do.There could have been a lot more scenes giving the characters a bit more depth and downtime but there's only so much you can fit into a movie I suppose.Other than that, the CGI was slightly more subpar than previous marvel titles. The production company was probably a bit more limited, and for what we had it was enough to get a really good feel for venom. He's portrayed in a lot more solid way than he has been previously, and this is one of the first titles where you can get a decent understanding of what venom can ACTUALLY do.Hopefully he makes an appearance in another film with hopefully a different light, Venom himself was excellent and I really want to see more!!!I loved watching this movie. I'd watch it again. It's one of my favorite movies, in fact! Go watch it, it's worth every second if you're just wanting a really cool movie to watch.",Venom
2811,tbcldwell,Critics vs. Movie goers,10,28 October 2018,"The critics hailed it as terrible and a big let down. Movie goers describe the movie as fun and entertaining. If your looking for a complicated, story driven origin story, your going to be in for a let down. But if you want to go to the movies, grab the popcorn and candy, and sit down to an entertaining, action fueled with simple story lines and solid acting from Hardy's character, then you will love it. I think that the writers was not looking to bring out so much as story is concerned for the big sequel, which is in the posts credits.",Venom
2812,jeffhubley,Massively disloyal to source content,2,27 October 2018,"First off, I am a MASSIVE Venom fan. I am reviewing this movie for what it is, a COMIC BOOK Movie.I feel my love for Venom surpasses anyone I've encountered in person or otherwise. I have read every venom comic I discovered and own most of them in loosies. Not to mention the $1000+ in statues and action figures I own.I gave this movie a metacritic score of 2 out of 10. This accounts for two things they got right in the movie. They cast Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and the symbiote came from space. That's where the parts I enjoyed, ended.The most successful comic book movies, in my opinion, have been those movies who have been most loyal to the source material. This ""Venom"" movie deviated far from that. -I am a Venom fan first, but I am sorry, there is no Venom without Spider-Man being tied to Venom's Origin. You don't get the full appreciation of Venom without seeing the stark contrast of how the two do business. Not to mention how Spider-Man effectively ruined both the symbitoe and Eddie Brock's lives (in their eyes) turning them into one of his most devout arch-nemesis.-They changed the very principles of the symbiotes to be ""mind controlling"" parasites. -The very look of Venom isn't correct because of the lack of his signature white spider. (This was explained by the creative team that it was due to a lack of Spider-Man. God, it is almost like they were on to something for a moment.)-The supporting cast for Tom Hardy was chosen very poorly. Just plain not interesting, didn't suit the roles.-The relationship with his ex-wife was far too kind. In comics his relationship with Anne is mostly horrible. -End Credit scene teasing Carnage. Woody Harrelson looks more like carrot-top than Cletus Kasady. With this being said, I think Woody IS a solid pick to play the part.There is so many more issues I had with this movie, but most probably won't get this far into my review, so I'll end it here.",Venom

2817,benjaminvize,"Rushed, shallow characters and lazy writing",4,24 October 2018,"As a huge fan of marvel films and since a kid, especially Spider-Man and venom, I was incredibly excited for this film-the first trailer looked good, and had a serious/scary undertone. However, after about 5 minutes into the film I realised that this was not the case at all. The film was a mess from the start, with a bad backstory, bad explanations and bad script writing. The characters were incredibly shallow and there was no character development at all. One quote that particularly annoyed me was ""life sucks Eddie, it just does"". I mean what is that??!! Awful. Plus another thing that really irked me was the fact that venom had no explanation for looking like Spider-Man- that is, venom bonded with Spidey first, and when Spidey removed the symbiote and it conbined with Eddie, it imprinted Spidey onto Eddie and became a twisted reflection of its first bond.There's just so many faults with this film, and it's such a shame. Only good thing is that
It's part of Sony Marvel, not the MCU, which is why Spider-Man is not in the film, and why Tom Hardys venom won't be in any mcu films.",Venom

Tom done a grate job.

Failure hero, got a superpowers, sorting some issues.
Please pick beautiful girls (maybe sexy) for the role of the heroine.
Only focusing on graphics not a realistic actions scenes.",Venom
2825,sammydebrou,A Turd,5,5 October 2018,"The idea of a Venom film has always been an exciting prospect. Add a good director, strong cast and on paper this film should tick the boxes. But it is let down by a painfully agonising script filled with cringey humour, flat characters, and an extremely underwhelming finale.
Tom Hardy is pretty good as Eddie Brock, a few scenes are hit and miss but he shines as Vemom. The banter most of the time between Eddie and Venom hits. Michelle Williams is fine as the love interest but I feel she wasn't given a lot to work off which is a shame as she turns out to be someone who is just there. Riz Ahmed puts up a fine performance as the villain Carlton Drake but again it's the writing that holds him back from being an interesting antogonist. He ends up being an evil businessman fed up of human beings, nothing new there. 
Action scenes are fine, some cool moments in fact which usually lead to someone's head coming off which was bloody entertaining. 
Overall I can say I had fun with the film but for the wrong reasons. This film was a huge missed opportunity and although a sequel will probably happen I'm not that excited for it. I must say the end credit scene is pretty darn good except for that last line (again the writing).
5/10 seems a fair score for this blunder.",Venom

2829,pricetim018,Its a tricky one,6,4 October 2018,I did enjoy this film. Tom hardy did play venom pretty good however this film really wasnt bad ass enough. This film was comical like most marvel films are nower daysbut dosnt fully work in venom for me. It felt like venom wasnt venom kind of thing. This film did get a little overbored towards the end but no spoilers just check it out n see for yourself. I still enjoyed the film though its very watcheble and it is funny at times but id rather bad ass then funny on this one. Still good to have a laugh i guess....,Venom

 It's a good movie. 
 Don't get me wrong, it had its flaws so I'll get them out of the way so I'm not being biased.
 Some of the action and CGI was a little lacking ie one fight scene could have been more impressive and brutal. It has a 15 rating in England and I didn't see that it needed one, I'd take my kid to see it and not worry. 
Those were only minor gripes to me as this movie was so much fun to watch. 
 I didnt mind the changes from the source material, they still crafted a very enjoyable origin story for a great Marvel character.
 They got the look and feel of Venom right, and with a brilliant performance from Tom Hardy you can't go wrong. He really made the balance of twisted and dark humour that makes Venom so enjoyable as a character. 
There were some hilarious moments and the conversation between Eddie and Venom was just how I wanted it to be.
 Well worth the watch.",Venom

Enjoyed venom, however I feel much of the film left a lot to be desired, off the bat, Eddie Brock and Venoms relationship was fantastic and the characterisation of both characters was superb. However I feel that story they were in was lackluster and disapointing, the film starts incredibly slow and fills us with far too much exposition and not enough action I was fairly bored throughout much of the first act, once Venom is introduced the movie picks up its pace a lot and is very enjoyable, the humour works and the character vibe together fantastically, However the plot and side characters are utterly dull and Venom and Eddie don't have a very good motive to come into the final act of the movie.Overall fun but disapointing",Venom

Although the movie does lack proper character development and depth, it is sufficiently packed with enough humour and action to give the film a decent rating. The ridiculous scenes do give you really good laughs (the entire theatre was cracked up). I would say that movie critics don't always like the same films as the majority of the audiences.

Please don't let ""professional critics"" discourage you from seeing this in the theaters. The movie starts off slow, because it has to introduce you to characters that have not been previously established. Venom doesn't have the advantage of connected-world-building and character development like the MCU movies, so there's no point to comparing It to them. I absolutely loved this movie, and I can't wait to see it again. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Venom should a sequel get the green light. I've been a Venom fan since his first appearance, and I've read all the Venom-related comics up to the most recent. Spider-Man is my all-time favorite character, and although this story doesn't involve Spidey, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie and how the story was presented.

This isn't going to have the same format of an Origin story like Cap or the Black Panther... no, it's Venom, the antihero in the spider-verse.
It HAS to be different from the rest.

Maybe spend some time exploring how Anne adjusts to Venom and/or how Venom relates to Ann. Or maybe spend some of that at the end of the movie. Eddie/Venom save the world. He swims in water with stuff burning for a sec. Then him and Anne are sitting on her stoop chatting.Umm... How did they get there? Why didn't they let us enjoy the fact that the world was safe? Why couldn't they just hold a frame for a damn minute!If firends ask, I will go see it with them. But I'd like to see an extended version",Venom

2892,ballphilipppi4,Amazing,10,7 October 2018,Don't believe what the critics say. Anyone who loves venom will love the movie. The relationship between Eddie and venom is hilarious.

The villain isn't great, his story arc is a bit cliche. Tom hardy is fantastic as Venom and he perfectly plays the duality of the character. Just wish there was more of the venom/Eddie relationship to see, it felt like a movie that had 40 mins cut out of it. I do hope to see more Venom in the future. Definitely recommend for a fun time though. Don't listen to critics that say it's as bad as catwoman. It just could have been better by developing Venom and eddies relationship a bit more",Venom

This is one of those times where they got it wrong. This movie did not have as much gore as I would've wanted, but it was humorous, great acting from Hardy and decent way to begin Venom.

2903,lisak868,Went in with low expectations - but this was a fun movie,6,5 October 2018,"After reading the critic reviews, I was expecting a hot mess, but i really enjoyed this film. It had its share of cheesy moments, and some truly bad CGI, but somehow it worked, thanks largely to Tom Hardy. Perfect choice for this role. Go grab a bucket of popcorn and see this movie.",Venom
2904,bercea_s,Comic Book review.,9,6 October 2018,"If you are stupid you will not like this movie. Let's have a look at what the movie does and not at what other wants it to do. It take content of 34 years old and puts it together very nice adapting it to an original idea. 
How the movie starts: it brings back a comic book scene with the space crush but brings a twist seen only in modern iteration of the comics. More symbiots and personalities of them. From this point the movie splits in three parts the rouge Symbiote, Eddie Brock and building the villain. 
The Rouge Symbiote is a nice part giving it personally and leading to revealing a few things about the new origins from the comics. Eventually this one ends up to be the big bad villain which still has a hive mentally just like in the comics.
Eddie Brock part is defining him as someone who lost everything for trying to do the right thing in life but ends up loosing everything. Eddie doesn't know where he stands and he doesn't hate Spider-man. This plays a big role as venom will not be fuelled by hate. Talking about fuel for venom should be fuel with the feeling of finding his place in this new world. Which this is actually what is happening. Seems like the director reads the comic not like some critics. Back to Eddie he is a broken character just as his name implies. He's goal is to become full again. And he does this at the end of the movie after going through a forced but beautiful friendship with venom.
Building the villain part of the movie is very psychological and requires a degree of understand higher that writing in a magazine. A pathological liar which builds an empire on the corpses of his employees which eventually is taken over the hive mind of the rouge Symbiote. A pay back to that annoying which has terrorise you to make more money for him.
A 5/5 stars movie especially for bringing she venom in such a magnificent way.",Venom
2905,grantdungan,Tom Hardy is the new Christian Bale,10,3 October 2018,"Hardy killed it. Hope to see a sequel really soon. Can't wait to see the Capone movie, saw it being filmed in New Orleans.",Venom
2906,jaidenemlynthomas,An amazing film,10,5 October 2018,This is one of the best films I've ever seen would 1000000% recommend it to anyone,Venom
2907,at-haniel,You need to raise your standards a little bit more,3,12 October 2018,"Okay, Venom, is by all accounts a mediocre film from a cinematographic and media point of view.
From the eyes of a Fanboy it may be nice or funny.
That does not make it a GOOD movie.
In any case, it makes it more fan service than a movie.
And what is happening is just what happened with Bright and Suicide Squad, these are ""nice"" movies for the average moviegoer, but for critics and people who have some film or media training it is not a good production.
And this is the reason why we have two scores for the movies, audience and critics (Yes, I'm saying the general audience tends to be stupid)So in summary Venom IS NOT GOOD, in the best of cases it is a movie, nothing more than a sequence of images accompanied by soundThat's just my opinion, and I honestly think it's valid, because the people that told me Venom is good are the same people who like Transformers and Fast & Furious, which I guess is what the studio was going for, the mindless audience.",Venom

Nobody acted like a real human would act and the action was a blurry nightmare. Its redeeming features include Tom Hardy doing the best he could with a bonkers script and the unintentional moments of hilarity where the villain's lead henchman constantly was certain that ""I've got him now"" when trying to catch venom before always not having got him.",Venom

A symbiotic villain universe without Parker is just as insane as it sounds. I don't know what they were thinking, but you cant just rip apart an entire story that's been set 40+ years and expect it to do well.

The film starts out a bit slow, but by the second act you're having fun with the action and laughing at Venom quips. Tom Hardy is a perfect foil for Venom's ferocious personality, and the two compliment each other throughout the film with differing opinions and endearing compromises.Without a doubt the Venom character is dark and mysterious, but also opens up and is even self deprecating at times, something that I did not expect. Chemistry between Eddie Brock and Anne is not the best, but it comes around by the end to something enjoyable and relatable.By the end of the film my wife and I were in stitches whenever Venom spoke, and couldn't be more excited for what comes next with this franchise.",Venom
2929,zekonja-barbir,Fun but with flaws,8,30 October 2018,Tom Hardy did a good Eddie/Venom but all the others are relatively bad. CGI is pretty good but at certain fast fight scenes I had a feeling it was a videogame cutscene. On the other hand the Eddie character is very fun to watch and the general theme and feeling are great. Humour is top level and I'd recommend catching it in the theatres while you can!,Venom

Tom Hardy is a very good actor but you could see that he was struggling to understand why he was even making this movie.

I love a good Jekyll and hyde tale, and Hardy nailed the duality of venom and Eddie. The film had everything. Even a kick ass car chase scene that I wasn't really expecting.

If you're a nerd (like me) and looking for a solid comic adaptation, well, look somewhere else. If you're looking for a movie with a lot of action, you'll find it.The plot was... palatable. Good old rich scientist guy who does everything for the love of science? Yea why wouldn't he become the villain? That's never been done before. Venom has some comic book feels, but it's more of a sci-fi movie based on comic characters. When Venom speaks, it quickly goes from eerie to entertaining with the quick witted one liners he spews out, like his unrelated red and blue counterpart.It's not a bad movie, but it's not great. Not a must see, unless you just have to finally see the Venom on screen.",Venom

My conclusion is that the critics were mostly right. It's a poorly directed movie with great actors doing the most with what they are given. The action is generic, most of the jokes fall flat the story has lots of logical flaws. But mostly, the movie is just kind of boring. What kept me from entirely loosing interest was the dialogue between Eddie and Venom which is where the focus of the movie should have been.

2954,jordybolt,Don't listen to the 'critics'.,8,6 October 2018,"Let me first say that you shouldn't take notice in 'Critics' reviews that say how poor this movie is.I want to actually congratulate Sony on getting Venom right looks wise and character wise. The constant fight between Eddie and Venom in the 'good vs evil' power struggle between them both is great to see on screen. I feel Sony got the character spot on in being portrayed by Tom Hardy as he is an excellent actor and made this film very funny in some scenes. The humour is at a great balance in the film and has some very great humour throughout. Venom and Riot looked visually incredible.The location is a high point in the movie being set in Califronia as I'm pretty tired of seeing New York all time. This felt it brought great depth to the action scenes on the Bike as California is hilly. The actions scenes were fantastic and stunning shots throughout the Bike chase.Riz ahmed was ok as Dr Carlton Drake he was neither brilliant or bad as the villain in this movie but his acting was passable. Riot however looked incredibly badass and awesome and the fight scene between Venom and Riot had me on the edge of my seat and rooting for Venom knowing he was the weaker Symbiote.A great film and I give this movie an 8/10. Critics are clueless nowadays and you should never pay attention to the reviews. I look forward to seeing Carnage when it comes out.Good Job, Sony",Venom

Great movie!!,9,3 October 2018,"Just got back and to be honest I thought because of the critics that the movie would be a mess, but I reallyyyy enjoyed it!! Tom hardy did a great job as always and Venoms character was amazing! Loved the jokes and the relation between those 2.

2969,jonathan-cruz9312,"A fun, but flawed ride",6,23 December 2018,"Getting straight to the point for those debating on whether or not to give this a chance. This movie is not nearly as bad as critics say it is. The writing is very much to blame for most of Venoms shortcomings. There is so many flaws within the almost 2 hour runtime, including awkward moments containing forced comedy, but it has enough enjoyment to warrant my time being spent watching it for those 2 hours, with great performances by Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams. From a critical standpoint, I can see why critics saw it as a disappointment, but there's plenty to be entertained by.",Venom

2971,leaponover,IMDB Users Let Me Down!,3,21 October 2018,"I usually ignore critics and come here to IMDB to get honest reviews, but the user base here let me down big time. First off, thanks to those of you who did rate the movie low for obvious reasons. This review goes straight to the knuckleheads who criticized the bad user reviews.First of all, to put things in perspective, I don't think I've ever picked up a comic book in my life unless it was because a real book was underneath it. So the problems some users had with the absence of Spider Man or the fact that Venom wasn't as badass as he is supposed to be didn't give me any issues. This is a real movie review from a non comic book fan. I should also say that doesn't mean I find fault with every comic book movie. I loved both Deadpools, enjoyed Fantastic Four, didn't really like the last Avengers movie but liked the ones before that. I like Guardians of the Galaxy, Batman and Superman are meh. Thor is pretty cool. Point is, I watch these things and it's not like I avoid them like the plague.Venom is like an Adam Sandler movie. No, not one of the classics. We aren't talking Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, we are talking Jack and Jill bad. I agree with the users who made it seem like Venom was going to go dark, but just withered. It's like when your big brother jumps out of the closet to scare you but in the end you see he's just wearing a white sheet and was too lazy to even cut out or draw on eyes and a mouth. The jokes I was expecting to be funny based on user views here must not have made it into the cut I watched. I think I maybe laughed once. There's just not really much of this movie I liked, whether it was a 40 something Michelle Williams dressing like a university Freshman, or the attempts at slapstick that made it look like the script writer fell asleep and his 14 year old filled in some blanks mad libs style. It was just not intelligently written, poorly stylized, lacked any cinematic beauty, and the action wasn't all that interesting. The only redeeming quality was that of Hardy's acting. He's legitimately a good actor. The rest is drivel.",Venom

Absolutely the trailer was looking good, but in fact they didn't make a good movie. Such a pity there were good actors in Venom. Maybe I went with higher expectations.
If you're a good fan of the Marvel movies (not including the comics because I assume they're different than the movies) then don't watch the movie because you'll get angry with Sony.
Sorry but I can't give more than a 1 out of 10 stars. Such a loss. I didn't even laugh one time. It looked like it tried to be a MCU movie but in fact they couldn't make it a good movie.

2986,christonatrike,Why edit so much out?,5,3 October 2018,"I'm confused as to why they chose to edit so much of the film out? On the subject of Tom Hardy and Venom himself. I thought the connection between man and symbiosis was great but the arc of venoms wants and needs change so rapidly and why is he giving relationship advice? 
Michelle Williams gave very little to her character arc, I'm unsure as to why she decides to break up with Eddie but yet she gives no sense of there ever being a major issue even when she breaks it off. He character never changed in any circumstance and she was completely unphased by Venom after one encounter. Weak plot line due to holes between the transitions from relationship problems to getting fired. One moment everything is ok and hen the next he's getting fired, nearly kicked out his apartment and dumped. Yet even when these happen. The stakes don't match the severity of what the scene is portraying. 
The lengths they went to to show venom dying by fire to then him still being in Eddie mid convo with his ex was weak. No sense of a reveal. As an audience, we know venom isn't dead but to lead us up to his inevitable determined fate to then show us he's actually alive so easily is failure to us. 
Overall. The cgi and established San Fran world was great and if there's to be a sequel. Please find a way to connect Spider-Man and other parts of the marvel universe. (I know, big ask).",Venom

Great popcorn action flick with some incredible visuals. Tom Hardy plays his role perfectly, but doesn't take himself too seriously.",Venom
2988,darth_v18,"So many snacks, so little time!",8,13 October 2018,"OK, so going in to this movie my expectations were pretty low from the start, given all the negative reviews & criticism floating around the film. 
But honestly, I'm so glad I went to see it. The first half an hour of the movie was a bit of a drag. Slow going, not much happening, I was starting to accept the negative reviews. But once Eddie finally adopts the Venom symbiote, the whole film just turns into a crazy roller coaster of fun. 
OK so the characters & storyline are probably not the best going, quite sublime and unoriginal by all accounts, but once the action starts, you will soon forget about how dull this movie started. 
Not being biast but I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Hardy's performance as Eddie/Venom, and he brings in some decent jokes and comedy along the way, he definitely makes up for some of the more shallow acting in this flick.
So for anyone having doubts about this movie like I did, I urge you to go & see it, not for the story, and maybe not even for the characters, but just to lose yourself in an hour and a half of all out fun and mindless violence.We are Venom 👍",Venom

There are moments in which Venom is quite scary but then he does something comical, which feels unnatural. There are a couple impressive CGI moments in the film but they are not enough to make up for the many scenes feeling forced, which is due to the script. Overall, a 6/10.",Venom

Tom Hardy did an amazing job portraying Brock and Venom. The bad guy was also great in the movie. CGI wasn't bad at all, I only had one problem, small one, at the end fight.

It definitely disappointed me though, I really wanted this movie to be amazing, and I feel like it could have been so much better had it focused on different things.So let's start with the pros. Venom. The relationship between Eddie and Venom is definitely the best thing about this movie, which is why it sucks that they didn't include more of it. My favorite scene is when Venom speaks to Eddie right after swimming across the lake, and I wish we would've gotten more of that. Tom Hardy was good as always, and the rest of the cast is fine, no one really stood out to me though.A major con for me were the fighting scenes, Venom is a pitch black color, and every fight scene takes place during the night, making the fighting scenes hard to enjoy.The movie was entertaining though, it was fun following Eddie Brock through this adventure. This movie could've been so much more, sadly it doesn't recognize its strengths and doesn't capitalize on it.I'd give it a 6.5/10 rating.",Venom

The movie with its wafer thin plot line ,has screenplay that will remind you of other non MCU movies .It was hard task to pull a Spiderman spinoff without spiderman but the path the writers took to establish this symbiote/anti-hero can simply be described as, ""been there seen that"" with first appearence of venom after nearly half of the movie has been passed, and that's not good nice since its the title character. Even its appearance didn't help the movie as post that movies trries to rush to climax and a showdown that too predictable .

3022,jpjg86,Holds its own,8,5 October 2018,"It's not the most compelling of stories, but let's be honest: that is not for what you watch films such as Venom. There is plenty of fun, good little quips from the Venom character and Tom Hardy's Performance is surprisingly good for the subject matter - by which I mean, given it is another Marvel movie, he gives a surprisingly gripping yet nonchalant performance, which suits the character well in my opinion.It does suffer from, what I am referring to as, 'First Movie Syndrome.' Symptoms include: too much exposition; uncertain characters and too much serendipity. However, again, these consistencies are not the reason for choosing to partake in movies such as Venom.Overall I disagree with the critics vehemently and suggest they get off of their high-artistic horse and watch the film again, this time without analysing and purely for the experience. If they're honest their opinion will change sharply.",Venom

I think this movie proved Me and everybody else wrong. Tom Hardy was amazing as Eddie. Eddie and Venom relationship throughout the movie is what made it so enjoyable, because most of the other characters were pretty colorless. I think this movie deserves a watch and an honest review. The CGI was pretty good throughout the entire movie along with the soundtrack. If your expecting something amazing and new don't get your Hope's up they played it a little safe in this movie and if they gave it a R rating it would have been amazing to see.",Venom

3029,rohanmalik-26810,"Great action, Horrible story. SPOILER free review",5,7 December 2018,"So, I finally watched Venom yesterday after so much anticipation and boy I was let down. This movie was nowhere near the hype it created through the series of some really awesome trailers. The only points it has scores are purely due to Tom Hardy's acting and a good (if not great) CGI which made our one of the favourite Anti-hero look convincingly real.The acting of all the major characters is pretty decent in most parts of the movie, be it Riz Ahmed, Michelle Williams or Reid Scott. The cinematography is also clean and appealing especially during the chase and the fight scenes. Though it could definitely have been better in a couple of scenes but nothing big. This movie missed exactly where it matters the most, i.e. the story.Coming to the story, I'd only just like to say that it was just plain bad and definitely one of the worst written comic book movie scripts of all time. The story was ambitious but it just never made sense. You'll constantly ask yourself throughout the movie, what the hell is happening and if the directors even gave the script a second thought before they decided to convert it into a movie. You can't find plotholes in this movie because the whole movie is one big plothole in itself. I can enlist all of them here but it'll not just make this review invariably long but also shell out some serious spoilers which I'm refraining myself from doing.In conclusion, I'd recommend you this movie only if you are an action movie lover and can just overlook the story aspect and doesn't care if the movie connects all the points or not.PS: There is one really awesome end credit scene featuring RIOT which pretty much sets up the sequel and I've my fingers crossed that SONY will work on their mistakes because seriously in my opinion, there is scope for a lot of improvement.",Venom

And yet, as the release date got closer and closer, I simply lost my interest. After watching the film, I was left wanting more out of the movie. The pacing of this film is far too uneven, especially the end. The ending for this film happens far too quickly and I felt that it was left open without a sense of closure. Granted, there were things I liked in the movie, such as the first on-screen debut of Riot, who plays the part of the film's main antagonist, and there were some fun ideas in the action of this movie, yet I also felt that it wasn't nearly as brutal as it should have been. Venom is a terrifying being who will eat anything that moves with bloody, vicious intent, and this movie does not portray that. A solo Venom movie should be rated R, while this film suffers wirh a PG-13 rating. The performances were solid, yet I saw no chemistry with Eddie Brock and Anne Weying; yet, the chemistry between Eddie and Venom was perfect, creating a feeling of a shaky friendship. All in all, this is a mediocre movie with a mediocre plot, and I would only recommend this film only to those who know little to nothing about this character or the most standard of filmgoers.",Venom

3041,shenalnishika,Ignore the bad critics,8,14 October 2018,This movie is really fun and action packed despite the slow start. It is a must watch for every one since it differentiates the personality of venom from the symbiote we knew in Spiderman 3.,Venom

3045,zackphillips,The beginning isn't good.. but the rest is very enjoyable,9,6 October 2018,"Honestly, this movie has a terrible opening that feels rushed as it tries to introduce this world and set up the characters. Within the scenes, the dialogue is lacking, there is an atrocious montage of news footage, etc. and yet it feels like it takes forever to get to the fun part- when Venom and Eddie make their connection. I loved every aspect of their relationship and how Tom Hardy portrayed Eddie, and I personally loved all the action sequences because I don't have a blatant hatred for CGI. Once that moment happened, the movie changed significantly for me, so I am taking away a star for the beginning. Otherwise, just an enjoyable movie!",Venom
3046,gicolek,"Surprisingly good, Perfect Hardy",8,13 October 2018,"I have to admit I was about to resign from going to the cinema after reading all of the negative reviews. Needless to as a huge fan of Hardy and Spiderman Universe I went there and I don't regret my choice. The movie is simply great. Much darker than all of the non R Marvel movies, yet funny. Tom's performance is great, not so cannonical plot is well written and actually makes a lot of sense (when it comes to comic based movie). Looking forward to the second installment. I hope Venom will join Spidey at some point :)",Venom

3048,sampage-09311,Great film overall!,8,6 October 2018,"Overall I think the film was great, it had humour and plenty of action. The build up was quite long but I think it needed that and the boss battle was too short in the end.

From start to finish I was less than enamoured by this film. I found it lacking in almost every possible catagory...visually it was decent but lacked the polish of a film made in 2018. The plot was overly simple & its execution even more so...the action sequences were either underwhelming or soo frenetic & obscured by darkness that I wasn't exactly sure what I was seeing...there was 1 shining star in this film & that was ( of course ) Tom Hardy. Hardy delivered his typical stellar performance, unfortunately it wasn't enough. I'm sure there will be a sequel as people seem to love this film. I do not happen to be one of them so I'll take a hard pass on V.2!!!!!!!",Venom

Yes, some of the dialogue/story is clunky and there's some plot holes and missing info.Also, not crazy about ""Anne"", and the way the female characters are written in general. The CGI and action do have their lows that'll make your head spin, but Venom looks like Venom and in a great way. But, Tom Hardy acts his little heart out ( and so does Riz Ahmed) and the movie, while not perfect, is fun.P.s. The mid credit scene gives one hope!",Venom

3062,qianlima,A medicore superhero movie,7,8 October 2018,"I was very hesitant to watch this movie due to the really bad critics in Rotten Tomato. But I felt that this movie couldn't be that bad because of Tom Hardy, and I went to watch it alone on a Sunday night. It is a pretty standard superhero movie in which the symboite callend Venom paratisize in a TV reporter named Eddie Brook. This gives him super power such as incredible strength and self-healing capability. The performance of Tom Hardy is excellent and the visual effects are also vivid enough to reflect the features of Venom. However, the plot sometimes doesn't really hold and the reactions of the actors are not supported.",Venom

It is not that bad",Venom
3068,cotiehoover,Not very good,4,10 October 2018,The storyline for the film is very boring with a very cliche villian who is evil for the sake of greed. The CGI in places is downright awful as is the writing. There are several plot holes. Several scenes and relationships feel rushed. There is little chemistry between Michelle Williams and Tom Hardy. The action is hard to follow in places due to the editing and overall dark color pallet of the film. The only positive I came away with was the chemistry between Venom and Eddie. There are a few decent jokes and fun enough scenes but over all a disappointment. There is a lot of room for improvement in the sequel the movie so desperately wants.,Venom

Tom Hardy does an incredible job. His character is quirky, funny, and I enjoyed his interaction with his host: Venom. Many people complain that Venom is too ""cartoony"", but I honestly loved every scene where you saw Venom in all his glory. It made me crave more!

I was really surprised when I saw it because I expected it to be bad but it wasn't it was pretty good.

I'm assuming the comic book fans are pissed about something but as someone that only vaguely knows the story of Venom, the movie deserves a much better rating. It was hilarious, the CGI was sick. I only caught one plot hole and it was minor. Can't wait for the next Venom movie to come out. Make sure you stay for the post credits scene!",Venom

Being a long time comic and Marvel fan, i thought it was well done. It had action elements similar to Black Panther and comedy elements similar to Deadpool. When Eddie Brock would speak to his internal Venom, that also reminded me of when Bruce Banner was speaking to his internal Hulk in Infinity Wars but, that concept was done much better in Venom. I highly recommend for the Marvel Comic fans.",Venom

This movie is great!,8,6 October 2018,"Tom Hardy plays great as Eddie Brock, meshes very well with Venom, and gives great action (with good humor too!) in this movie. Critics who I've read/watched reviews from them, after I saw the film, are attacking this movie as poor story/humor/backstory. This isn't a bad movie! Expecting more venom movies to come and am optimistic that this series will go up from here! (Side note: my only disappointment is the end scene after the credits. Not worth your time waiting for.) Go see this movie! #WeAreVenom",Venom
3087,afrozchouri,#WeAreVenom,9,6 October 2018,"Tom hardy's performance as Eddie/Venom is outstanding. Don't fall for the negative reviews from critics,they always talk bad, though these people can't write, produce, or direct a movie so nobody should care about their reviews. Rather just check the audience reviews which are honest and genuine. 
Movie is action packed. The relationship between Eddie and venom is the thing you'll see in the movie which is amazing. VFX are really awesome.
Its a worth watch for marvel fans. Just go ahead.

But walking into this movie after my whole month of hype was shut down after seeing multiple poor reviews was saddening. After I watched the movie, I was satisfied with everything they through in. It had a dark tone when it came to the villains ambitions yet had a very fun and brilliant relationship with Venom and Brock. The only thing that I noticed was the rush of a beginning. I couldn't even keep track of the days and nights. But as soon as the symbiote comes into play it's an exciting and worth seeing movie.",Venom

3103,mastermathman-55651,Hardy is everything,6,31 October 2018,"I could go on about how the film has horrible pacing in the first half, how anyone not named Eddie Brock is just kinda...there, not much to their characters, and all that stuff, but I'll say what I enjoyed most about the movie by far, and why it only earns it a 6/10; Tom Hardy is amazing. He's the only person in the entire film who gives 110%, and the best parts of the movie are his interactions with him and Venom. Unfortunately, that's the problem with the movie; the only reason it's any good is BECAUSE of Hardy. He single handedly is trying to keep this movie afloat, and when your movie only has one thing going for it, it does not make it a good movie. Therefore, the most I can give this movie is a 6/10. If the sequel can give the supporting cast more to do, and keeps the pacing good throughout, then I truly believe it will succeed. Oh, and an R rating. It felt like this movie pushed the limits of a PG-13 movie, and the sequel could benefit from a hard R. Anyways, that's my piece. If you liked it, good for you. If you didnt like it, good for you. This is my take.",Venom

This is right up there with Bane. Hugh Jackman will always be known for Wolverine; Ryan Reynolds will always be Deadpool; Keanu Reeves will always be Constantine/Neo/John Wick; Tom Hardy will always be Bane/Venom.Aside from that, if you're the type of person that has to cretic every scene, every word spoken, and every little thing in the movie... then this one isn't for you. But then again, no movie is for you. What happened to just watching a movie and appreciating it for what it was? When did we become so infatuated with our own opinion on a subject that we have to blast it because it didn't match up to our own picture-perfect idea of what it 'should' have been?All in all, this was a really good movie.

The synergie of those 2 characters clashing and the resolves they take during the movie is really questionalble. Eddie Brock is being portrait as a loser but they failed in my opinion and Venom is not so much a anti-hero. Apart from mayb 1 or 2 instances the movie is not funny when it really tries to be. About the origin story of Venom they did a remake, which is fine if you do it right, but did not deliver on a compelling alternative in my opinion.",Venom
3113,marcelboyan-86708,Fun albeit generic introduction to the character,5,9 October 2018,"Before watching the movie, I was pretty hyped since Venom is one of my favourite Marvel characters and I'd always yearned for a faithful depiction on the big screen. A few factors, like the origin story of Venom without Spider-Man's involvement and the decision on Sony's behalf to cut it down to a PG-13 rating worried me, but I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.Looking back, I was unfourtunately diappointed with the majority of the movie. The strory is bland, and takes about an hour to really get going. During that opening, we learn a lot about Eddie Brock's character, and Tom Hardy brings his own unique and quirky take on the character. While I enjoyed it, his performance might turn off some people. As for the events themselves, let's just say with the way the love story is depicted in here you can really tell that one of the Fifty Shades screenwriters was involved with this project.As for Venom itself and the rest of the movie, it worked quite well, although it's disappinting that the finale consists of yet another dark and blurry CGI fest, where you can at times hardly tell what's even going on. The banter between Eddie and the symbiote was the highlight of the movie for me, it's entertaining and even hilarious in parts. However, they advertised this movie as a darker anti-hero story, a promise the end product doesn't fulfill in the slightest. Yes, it is initially more seroius in tone, but gradually becomes more light hearted and humorous towards the end, which is a damn shame. Venom starts off with ambigious motives, but suddenly within 5 minutes he decides he wants to help Eddie stop the antagonist from bringing more sybiotes to earth. That felt rushed and lackluster.In summary, I enjoyed Venom, but I have no desire to watch it again, which is a shame since I really wanted to love this movie. But as it stands, it is a fun but ultimately mediocre movie.",Venom
3114,ibadi-90934,Better than critics would have you believe,8,7 October 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was as advertised with humor and action. The plot was good for a spinoff superhero movie, definitely not on the level of the MCU, but still good enough to not spew boredom. Tom Hardy is the highlight of the movie. Even Riz Ahmed did well as the villain. Not a typical scary badass but someone you'd definitely love to hate. His girlfriend, however, wasn't convincing at all. Kirsten Dunst or Emma Stone would've been much better picks IMO. CGI was ok but got better as the movie progressed. Overall I'd definitely say it lives up to what I expect. But to give a little perspective, I also loved Man Of Steel and critics decimated that movie. Anywho, I'd at least recommend checking out for yourself. Don't let critics deter you.",Venom
3115,superduperstaar,Don't trust paid reviews,10,9 October 2018,Movie was fun and entertaining. Plot was simple and straightforward,Venom
3116,amymunchkin,OML I LOVE IT!,8,11 December 2018,"Ive seen this movie at the least 8 times since its been released and 5 of those times were in the cinema and not once was there a low crowd. This movie shows true potential and could even show off sequels in the near future, and this is why i rated 10/10. It is both humorous and gruesome but in a good way. The humour Eddie Brock shows (Tom Hardy) is actual humour but in contrast to this Venom's humour (again Tom Hardy) is a dark one which is still funny when used in the right context. This movie is a true marvel miracle and lifted my spirits after the events of Avengers Infinity War. I highly recommend watching this movie and hope to see more of Eddie and Venom in the future.",Venom

3118,hotspur-88906,Average,6,28 October 2018,Not a massive depth to the plot. Action scenes were at times dark blury and a little cgi muddled. Just was average.,Venom
3119,peterdanieltr,High expectations,5,3 November 2018,"As the title says, I had high expectations for this film.
The actors didn't disappoint, but unfortunately the story seemed unimaginative and rash.
The story could have told so much depth, especially with this cast.",Venom
3120,Tomo-231,It's okay,4,13 October 2018,"Firstly let me say that i'm glad people are enjoying this movie HOWEVER
The story was just an okay excuse to see Venom do cool stuff. And when Venom was on screen it was awesome and he as a character was fun to watch however other than that it was pretty shallow. I didn't feel much for the characters and i felt like some scenes were straight up pointless. One of the ending scenes just got me like "" Uhm wait what just happened?"" , maybe it's on me but some cuts were sloppy and some obvious to keep the PG-13 rating. If they kept the scenes in maybe i would have enjoyed the movie a bit more and that would have given the movie more consistency. I need to mention the action because they were the shining moments but a few scenes got ruined by those previously mentioned cuts. Also the antagonist just didn't make sense in my opinion and i didn't care much for him + weird choice to put Riot as the main villain? (Because of comic cannon)
Bellow average movie with PG-13 syndrome.",Venom
3121,orasib,Forget the critic's!,9,5 October 2018,"If you are used to the typical marvel films u may not like this, this is very much darker. However saying this it's an action packed , funny, romantic all in one film, it may not do well in the cinemas but it will probably become a cult classic, I hope they make a second as will defo go watch that at the movies",Venom
3122,yearofthechris,Totally Discard Critics Reviews nowadays.,10,15 October 2018,"I put a 10 out of 10 as counter to trolls with no serious judgement towards movies these days.Its an 8. Maybe a 7. But its good. Not the greatest. But the dynamic between organism and host its really enjoyable to see through the whole movie. Thats what pushes the movie forward. So in the end Venom works. Its entertaining enough for a second watch at theaters. Definetely Will do that.But on too of that i need to address the fact that Critics these days are biased towards product and company.How can Critics give The Last Jedi stellar Reviews and Stellar when that movie is a complete disrespect of all sorts. And then give this movie the lowest, when what it sets out to do it makes it with a bang!I dunno judge for urself. But what i say is. Make ur own voice and this time around ignore the Critics score about this one. They are the ones who thought it was cool to not think anymore. Why did Luke leave a map behind for the resistance to find him to begin with when all he wants is to die... (Which he accomplishes masterfully... Snoke didnt even tried... No one did... So lame it stinks) and then comes this really enjoyful flick and they take it too seriously.Critics are down and out from now on. It was enough. See the movie u want to see and if it was bad, carry on. Next. But don't let Critics steer u away from good movies. Just because they made a name for themselves.Be your own. Raise your voice. And remember if a movie is good just spread the word to ur closest and enjoy a good night at the theater with the ones u dig.Take care y'all
Its a venomous world now.
This movie proves it.",Venom

3126,pisicutzalp,Ignore the critics!,9,9 October 2018,"I have to agree on some points, this is not the typical superhero/anti-hero movie. It's basically a rom-com between a human and an alien, but that's what makes it so non-typical. It was a fun watch, definitely a would-watch-it-again and I've been craving for more Venom & Eddie content since I saw the movie a few days ago. What's a shame is that it was too short, I would've wanted there to be more scenes on how Eddie deals with the presence of Venom in his body and more scenes on their relationships. Hopefully we'll get more of that once Venom 2 comes out. The mid-credit scene was also expectable, but sturprising nonetheless. The end-credit one just gave us a craving for the upcoming Into The Spider-Verse this Christmas.",Venom

Tom Hardy was phenomenal and hilariously quirky (if you can imagine) and Venom was witty and fierce albeit a bit of goofball haha (yeah no really, it worked really well tho so don't worry!)

3142,clairethecat,Don't listen to the critics unless you're just there to bash the film,8,5 October 2018,"Alright, Venom has had a bad rep with the critics right off the bat. I wouldn't say that movie is amazing or something fresh and new. I will say however, and I say this with honesty, that this movie was very enjoyable. As a Venom comic book fan I would say I had so much fun with this movie.Sure, it has some of the bad traits of a bad superhero movie, Bad movie soundtrack, first 30 minutes of the movie feeling super choppy like some of it was left on the cutting floor, a bad supervillain that didn't intimidate the audience at all and some bad CGI that makes it look like a 90s movie.But if you can look past that, I can guarantee you'll have a good time. The dynamic between Eddie and Venom had so much chemistry and interesting to see, it was probably the best part of the film in the whole. Just Venom in particular, he honestly passed my expectations of being the symbiote that I knew from the comics.The reason I think the critics are so harsh on this film is because of them getting the 'Superhero Fatigue Syndrome'. Where people start getting tired of seeing the same movie formula used over and over again. As an avid moviegoer, especially for the comic book films, I do not mind the many films of comic books. The critics always want something fresh, something new that doesn't make them bored. Maybe because I actually like the usual movie tropes being used again and again, I enjoyed Venom.I would say Venom as an R rated film would be great to see, but I do not mind it being either as Venom in the comics isn't really known to be so gory and graphic anyways.",Venom

3148,riaddaboss,Interesting movie,8,5 October 2018,"I do not understand where all the hate for Venom is coming from, this movie was a much better introduction to the character than Spiderman 3. Here are a few things I enjoyed about the movie:
Tom Hardy is the star of the show both as Eddie Brock and Venom.The plot is very basic, nothing too out of the ordinary.Fight and transformation sequences were amazing, particularly the first Venom transformation.The movie does give fans easter eggs, scattered around the movie.The comedy between Eddie Brock and Venom is hilarious.The soundtrack was very fitting with the style of the movie.On the other side here are a few things I disliked about the movie:
Certain fight scenes were too choppy, particularly the finale.Michelle Williams' character had some pretty bad lines.Carlton Drake seemed very generic as a villain, but teaming up with Riot was one of the best moments in the film.Overall, I would like to say that Venom got an 8.5 in my opinion.",Venom

the movie its self has a few plot holes and can be a bit hit and miss in places. the cgi is brilliant and the scenes with with eddy ( Tom Hardy) talking to the cgi venom seemed real. The actions scenes are good with a bit of hummer in as well. 
The few down floors to this film take awhile for anything really to happen with the title character (Venom). and the inconstancy with the plot on how the symbiote actually work.
All in all i did enjoy . but die hard fans might want to give it a miss",Venom

There were multiple moments that made me think ""Why did he/she do that?"" or ""why are they not explaining it more?"" and making the audience just roll with whatever is happening. The biggest offender was when Venom suddenly decided to protect earth because Eddie Brock ""changed his mind"", and that was that. For me, I just wanted more 'why', but overall I enjoyed it.",Venom

But the action scenes were messy as you can tell who's who (like Transformers, but worse) and some of the speech is laughable (the ""I'm kind of a loser"" part actually cracked me up).It's ok to make commercially viable movies for the mainstream - just don't do it on the back of making the trailer looking dark and edgy!

The plot is so paper thin and the dialogue so uninspired I found myself eager for it to be over so I could go home. The only good point in the entire movie is Tom Hardy who's amazing and doesn't phone it in. I can honestly picture a film exec ordering an intern to write the script over the weekend. The rest of the movie felt heartless and pointless and a complete waste of a great character. The CGI, action and flimsy story just can't hold up when compared to Marvel or even DC movies. There's nothing new and nothing even interesting. Do yourself a favor and instead watch ""Upgrade"" which is like the exact same movie only it's actually good. So y should just stop trying and give venom and the rest of the spider verse to Marvel who actually know what they're doing.",Venom

3183,mtufly,A Fantastic Re-imagining of My Favorite Marvel Villain!,8,5 October 2018,"First of all I have to say, this is not a comic book movie, nor is it set up like one. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting to see a creation of the Venom from the comics. They have completely reinvented Venom and made the move an incredible experience. The movie has an over all dark setting, which sets the perfect tone for the story. They do an incredible job setting up Eddie Brocks story, showcasing his life as a reporter and what corrupt power can truely do when you dig your nose where it is not suppose to be. The relationship between Eddie and Venom is hilarious. They continue to go back and forth inside Eddies mind, making for some of the funniest and surprising lines in the movie. Seeing them learn to bond leaves me feeling incredible as the credits rolled.Supporting characters are set very well in which they play off of Eddies situation making the story that much richer. The villain was very well writen seeing as how he starts off seeming like a guy that is wanting to make the world better, but as the movie progresses slowly comes out to being a villain you will love to hate. Overall, I think this was a fantastic movie and was very entertaining. Whether you are already a fan of the character or someone just looking for a great movie to watch with good action and funny dialog with a great story, then check this one out.",Venom
3184,nicholas-84801,I expected so much better,4,13 October 2018,Cheesy writing didn't help Hardy make the character all it could be.

Despite what you see in the critics, don't pay them too much attention. It's not the best movie you'll ever watch, that's a given but is far from the worst comic book character movie. It's enjoyable, with cool scenes and will even make you laugh.",Venom

So you know I'm expecting a lot from this movie, that had taken so long to finally make and was trashed in spider man 3's version. And honestly I don't see why people are saying ""worst movie ever"" ""waste of time""... blah blah blah. I enjoyed it. Was it a great move? No. Was it an awesome movie? Maybe if you were in a good mood or visited the dispensary before you went to the theatre. But in my option it was a good enjoyable movie. Like other reviews said yeah it would have been cooler rated R. And Tom Hardy said they took about 30-40 minutes out so hopeful the Blu-ray has that added to it. So if your looking to turn you're brain off and just enjoy some humor and action (and see my awesome city of San Francisco) go see it! I can't wait for the sequel and the mid credit scene sets it up perfectly. Also this is the first time I ever wrote about a movie but I have to defend it cause it is nowhere as bad as people are saying",Venom
3192,ffranciscocasas,Good but..,7,3 October 2018,"It is a very good film to pass the time but it is not really horror.The lack of terrifyng scenes make it a typical Marvel movie, if you want to present the dark universe you should start with dark and twisted scenes. Out of this, very good movie to watch.",Venom
3193,jfullenkamp,👍,10,9 October 2018,"Love this movie. Don't listen to the critics. They are a dying breed in a society which values audience opinion over any critic. They get paid for good/bad reviews. Go out and see movies for yourselves to formulate an opinion instead of letting a critic form one for you. This movie is on par with any of the origin movies for Iron Man, Captain America, Ant-Man, etc. and in no way do I view that as a bad thing. It's a great starter. I'm excited for what's to come (due to end credits scene)!",Venom
3194,cjharrison-23416,Thoroughly enjoyable and darker,8,27 October 2018,"My expectations were low, but thankfully I ignored the neigh sayers and watched this at the cinema.
It's self contained but does tease with more to come in the credits.
The film ignores the usual marvel formulaic approach and is more akin to deadpool in terms of being different. It's dark but also has some comic moments.
I really enjoyed this and is definitely up there as one of my favourite marvel films.",Venom
3195,maxrseltzer,A really good movie,8,13 October 2018,"It was very entertaining with lots of great action and amazing special effects. Ignore the critic reviews, it's worth seeing",Venom
3196,jdennis-89019,"Has some fun parts, but an overall lackluster film",4,8 October 2018,"When this film was first announced I thought it seemed like a strange choice to do a standalone Venom movie, especially one with out the presence of Spider-Man. However, I had high hopes for it because of the inclusion of Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, and Jenny Slate; all of which I am fond of. Unfortunately the cast of actors could not prevent this movie from being a bland, sloggish film that will most likely be a low point in all of their careers. One of my bigger problems with this story is that they failed to pin down what the tone of the movie was supposed to be. There were elements of romance, action, horror, and comedy strewn throughout and none of it was done particularly well. The comedy was exceptionally poor, being that actual jokes were replaced with someone just saying a curse word. I have a few gripes about Venom that I won't talk at length about including: poor CGI that culminated with a dark, hard to see fight, flat chemistry between the performers, a typical ""do bad things to do good things"" villain, below average editing, and poor story structure. But the worst element of the movie in my opinion is Eddie's character development. Eddie starts off being a certain way and never has to reconcile anything with his personality or change himself to become a better person. In the beginning he's idealistic and wants to help people, followed by a brief moment of not wanting to help people, and then being followed again by wanting to help people. He never has to face adversity and find out what he really stands for. He never has a moment where he has to reevaluate the consequences of his actions (albeit a quick scene in which he apologizes to Williams' character about something from the past). And lastly, he never has to make any sacrifices to protect what he loves or be a hero to the people. Some things I did like about Venom: Eddie and Venom's dynamic was enjoyable, an exciting opening scene, and an excellent score by the always talented Ludwig Goransson. Overall, Venom is a bland movie with some entertaining elements. It feels like it belongs in the mid 2000's rather than 2018. There isn't enough good film making and story in Venom to make it shine, but still manages to be marginally entertaining as an action blockbuster.",Venom
3197,christopherpaulgemignani,Should of took lessons from deadpool..,9,18 December 2018,This was a pretty good movie not great.. i liked the relationship brock had with the venom but he had too much of a good conscience.

3201,matthewbates-76073,AMAZING!,8,5 October 2018,"Seeing this film a day after release i had been reading over some reviews before hand where they describe this film as nothing more than the trailers. How wrong they are, this film really does live up to expectation and has everything needed for a great Movie. I would love to see a sequal in the coming years and would highly reccomened it to any Marvel fan",Venom
3202,hollydibdin,Don't believe what you read.,9,14 October 2018,"Initially I saw the reviews for this film and the shear volume of negative critic comments made me assume the film was a typical lazy mess trying to catch on to the success of the MCU. Despite this I thought I might just watch the film anyway to see the disaster for myself. 
The film was fantastic, with a perfect mix of gory tense action and rib tickeling comedy. The film definitely subverts your expectations and brilliantly allows you to connect to a humorous alien blob of goo. 
The critics of this film completely miss what makes this film great. It isn't a storyline masterpiece but it is the film that venom comic book fans have been waiting for. Reviews totally rip apart a film that should be praised for its unique take on a very unusual character that has struggled to make its way successfully on film. 
So before you think that Venom is as awful as it is described in magazines and reviews, take the time to watch it yourself and trust me you won't be disappointed.",Venom
3203,myemailisbroken,Not the pile of dog mess you've been led to believe!!!!,8,8 October 2018,"Good fun movie, just enough humour, just enough action. The main villain lacked a little bit of weight in my opinion, but then I was really hoping that the main villain would be Carnage!
Hopefully he will be in the hopefully R or 18 rated sequel !!!!!!

Hardy gave a great performance and I really enjoyed the movie! Venom looks cool (the preview doesn't do venom justice) and the CGI was better than I expected.

The villain isn't very good, but still better than some Mcu villains. I really liked the story between Eddie and The simbiote. Tom Hardy played Brock in a strange but good way. The script some times is bad. There are some plotholes.Overall, the film is entertaining and nice. 7/10",Venom

Movie has good cgi, good action scenes, good background music but the main problem with the movie was its plot. The story was sooooo simple. When the movie was over I was like 'Huh thats it?'Many from audience was also dissapointed from story. The second promblem of the movie was its villian. Its villian was sooo weak. There was a scene in the movie in which Vemom said we have 0% of winning against him and them he killed him in 10 minutes.
Overall the movie was average time pass movie. It is not that type of movie which will stay in your mind for weeks or months. There are 2 post credit scenes in this movie and both of the scenes worth watching.",Venom

The side charcters were a bit forgettable but this is an intro to character movie so the main point is letting the viewer see who they are going to the movie to see, as well as let us know what this version of the character is going to be like. The interactions between the two main characters (Venom and Brock ) were great, I do hope that now the character has been flushed out a bit the next movie contains a little more depth.

3236,inlsco,Ambiguous trainwreck going for a walk off the rails at the end of its destination,1,6 October 2018,"This review's headline says it all - the movies lacked sensible direction, especially in the second part of the movie. The main villain, Dr. Some-crazy-entrepreneur-gone-rogue, where to begin... His decisions felt way too one-dimensional and forced, almost without any background, so to say. His employees were also nuts, acting like children, not taking all the possibilities into account and behaving carelessly.The Brock infiltration into the evil human experimentation facility was dumb as well. Where were all the security cameras, all the passcodes, bioscan (for eyes, fingerprints, and such) devices, tracking what people come in at any time in the day, etc. What the hell - we should be seeing a maximum security facility because a leak from the facility can be devastating to the entire company, if the media finds out... And what we see in the movie is children's kindergarten security type :)So in general, this movie lacked confident direction and GOOOORE. Venom snacks a guy's head off and WHERE IN THE WORLD is at least a single drop of blood? What is this madness? The movie felt so clinically clean I was disgusted when watching the ""supposedly-bloody"" corpse-eating scenes... PG-13 is a terrible decision.Sadly, PG-13 ruined the movie for me... And I loved Logan, with a R, very much, because of its believable tension and believable use of real-world materials (blood flows where it's supposed to, etc).",Venom
3237,westkwalex,Excellent movie.,10,11 October 2018,The only reason to be upset about this movie is that it doesn't exactly follow the comics. Otherwise it was entertaining and exceeded my expectations. I feel too many people just want to get on here and knock down movies for every single detail as if they're some sort of worthy film critic. Pro tip: if you're that good at dissecting movies make a job out of it and stop eating food movies poorly because you're a moron.,Venom
3238,davidfoward,Great ride. But a R rating would have been insane.,8,7 October 2018,"This movie screamed R rating please. But still very enjoyable. Tom Hardy is the perfect Eddie Brock. As far as origin movies go. It was great. Still had some plot holes, but hey that's Sony.",Venom
3239,matthewalati,I don't unserstand the critics. This movie is not bad!,7,7 October 2018,"Look, to start with, i was all on board for this movie. It was a bit sad that spiderman wasn't a part of it but there are stories where venom doesn't start off with spiderman and they've done fine. I went to see the movie tonight and i'm pleased to say it was a good movie. Yes i can agree there are some questionable things in there but they are minor nit picks imo. Like the wilhelm scream which was actually lowered in volume so it was much less noticeable, and the way that cletus kasidy is shown off. The quote ""there will be carnage"" does sound a little corny but hey, the message is conveyed in the end.Now, the actual story of the movie wasn't even as bad as literally every critic who has put a bad rating says it is. All the reviews I've read say its hard to follow which it really isn't if you actually watch the movie. Also another thing i did see in a review was that it is not explained as to why the symbiote chose eddy. The reason is literally explained within the first few minutes of the movie. The symbiote has to match with the host in order to bond, similar to a blood transplant. Apparently people just deleted that part out of their mind because of how many people complained about it.Now for my personal opinion on the movie. Venom looks perfect, sony nailed the design, the story was interesting, the nods to characters from the venom comics were an unexpected but welcome surprise (she-venom and cletus), the eddy and venom chemistry was done very well, tom hardy's acting was great the entire way through, and the movie is enjoyable non the less. The few bad parts include some cringey dialogue but its only here and there so its not to hard to sit through, riot comes across as an intimidating villain but with a very generic goal which is seen in most movies. World domination. The end fight scene was a tough one to follow but when they weren't meshing together you could tell what was happening, and that's basically all the bad parts lf the movie for me.Overall, the movie was enjoyable, if you want to see this movie, don't base it on reviews, base it on your opinion. Not everyone has the same view on things. Decide for yourself whether it is good or bad.",Venom
3240,brejwag,Tom Hardy with yet another incredible performance,9,7 October 2018,"I thought the movie was great. They portrayed venom perfectly. He was bone shivering scary, and yet extremely likeable. Honestly did not expect the banter between Eddy Brock and Venom to be so hilarious.

3242,marcorapa,"Good overall, just feels forced at times",7,10 October 2018,"Obviously Tom Hardy does more than well as Eddie/Venom that is a character which suits him, distinguished by a blending of funniness and darkness. 
There are some interesting ideas and well shot scenes. Highlights are fight scenes, which i found really pleasant to watch. 
Comedy is clearly enjoyable but too present in the movie, which in general could have probably focused a little more on the ""dark"" side of both Eddie and Venom.
Didn't like the female character Michelle, who i found kind of empty, but i get it is not a key factor to the movie.
Could have liked the villain character, not badly acted but really too forced: we all got that he had a God complex, repetition and making it obvious wasn't needed.Tom Hardy kept high standards for a movie which had a lot of potential (the whole mix between good/evil was really intriguing), that i found not fully expressed.",Venom
3243,arcisne-69849,Ignore press reviews... You'll enjoy this movie,9,11 October 2018,"This movie showed me something I thought before... Spiderman may have been a great plus to include in, but is not needed, at least for now.
The world around Eddie Brock and the characters around him are likeable, and the acting of the cast is very good. I really liked the relationship between Venom and Eddie. 
Tom Hardy makes you feel Eddie as a real person with flaws and virtues, and Michelle Williams' performance is always great to watch.
Of course this movie has flaws, probably because they wanted to apply some of the superhero movie formula that's being profitable for years... I hope they fix it in the next movie.
The FX give life to Venom as I expected, they're everywhere you look.
Please make the next movie R rated, in order to fullfill the promise they make in the post credit scene.
Go and watch this movie, you'll be pleased and have a good time. Yes, Venom is a Marvel character, but not a Marvel-Disney character, and that's a difference I enjoyed.",Venom

3252,edalmargo,Not as bad as i thought,6,8 October 2018,"After watching this film I am in a tremendous indecision at the time of writing this review and it's because on one hand I found a ""Guilty pleasure"" in all the lyrics but in the other I have come across a film that could have been so much but it settled with being average.
Venom is a film that is a victim of itself and that having an incredibly large potential, it is satisfied being average movie directly aimed at immediate entertainment. Well, the truth is that it fulfills its function, it is entertaining and the film is easily digested, however, to people who love the character as it is my case and that although I did not expect much from this film, i hoped that they would take better advantage of the elements that were available for his performance, such as his stellar signing; ""Tom Hardy"", who is a great actor, but who nevertheless in this film feels too wasted in all the possible levels.
His script is at least deplorable and tells you a story that feels compelling and you never manage to believe it or feel that sense of urgency about something unexpected can happen. EVERYTHING on this movie is linear and does not give you any surprises.
Undoubtedly, the best of the whole movie is VENOM itself, which shines with its own light, both in design and in its own personality. Maybe it's what saves this movie from a possible collapse.
In conclusion, Venom is not a bad movie, it all depends on what mentality you see it. If you want to enjoy an hour and a half of pure entertainment, you will find it. But if in turn, you were looking for something more in it than that, you will be very disappointed.",Venom

3263,tumblrgirl-40547,Rating for the critics 0/10,10,17 November 2018,Any critic who says tom hardy is over acting is a coward who hasn't been around a human person enough to know how they act. When Eddie's sad he looks miserable and teary and openly expresses why. He shrieks when he's startled. He panics when he's confused and worried. He silently screams when he's angry and can't do anything about it. He reacts to the events of the movie in a way that someone might actually respond.Tl;Dr: Venom was an amazing movie with good acting and the critics are wrong,Venom
3264,sivojesse,Not even bad,8,21 October 2018,"Was good, not great. But I really enjoyed it. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",Venom
3265,shannahward,New favorite movie,10,7 October 2018,I am amazed by the amount of negative comments. This was my favorite movie I've seen all year it was amazing. The visual aspects and humor was just outstanding! I will buy this on DVD for sure!,Venom

3267,abdulattara,Tom hardy is phenominal but venom is not.,7,6 October 2018,"Venom is not the best but by far its the best sony movie. The one thing that disappoints you is that u dont see a lot of venom in this movie. Tom hardy did his job perfectly. He is the best venom we will ever have. There is no bonding between eddie brock & the venom which everybody wanted. 
Tip: wait for the mid credit scene.",Venom
3268,stefcook-15775,More,10,17 October 2018,Only complaint I had is I wanted more. I lef the theater wishing I had been given more Eddie Brock and Venom interaction. I could have watched 24 hours of that and been perfectly happy,Venom

Venom is really funny and badass at the same time, good interactions between Eddie and venom slowly bulding up the chemistry, the main vilian is quite good could have been better but it's okay for now, maybe we will see a more menacing one in a sequel, anyway don't waste your time with the reviews and enjoy the film.",Venom

To see him like the way he is in the comics. Amazing acting and love the story. The critics are wrong about the movie. They are dumb. This movie is great and deserves a 10 !,Venom

I'm a huge fan of venom in the comics so take my opinion with a grain of salt but I loved the movie!",Venom
3281,iamahmedimran,This is not your ordinary superhero movie,10,7 October 2018,I have watched this movie yesterday alone. All of my friends didn't want to go to the theater because of the bad review. I must say that's a worth movie for super villain. It is action packed and very entertaining,Venom

Awesome Action.,9,5 October 2018,"I do think this movie suffers from script, but mostly it's a great movie, I also think that the first axlct of this movie suffers, but as soon as Venom comes in it becomes a great, Action packed, fun movie.

3286,krithiksrivatsan,Don't believe the critics. This is an underrated movie,8,8 October 2018,"First I thought that the movie is gonna suck after the rotten tomatoes score. I went to the movie without any expectation. I was very shocked to see how good the movie was. The relationship between Eddie and venom is damn accurate and funny. This movie is more of a comedy thriller than a serious one. So, just ignore the critics and watch this in theatre. It was a hell lot of fun.",Venom
3287,broken_structure,A fun and entertaining movie,8,5 October 2018,"This movie did exactly what I wanted. I got to see a big Venom, unlike Spiderman 3's tiny Venom. They used the term ""WE"" and it had awesome action scenes. I wish it had more Venom in it but that is my only complaint in Sonys control. Spiderman would have made it better but that is out of Sonys control at the moment.",Venom
3288,khansalman-76074,"Simply, A great movie (JUST IGNORE THE CRITICS)",8,6 October 2018,"I like it because it is a perfect blend of Action, Comedy & Venom.Sony managed to make a very good movie without Spider-Man.

3290,ychapper,Most honest reveiw you will read,6,7 October 2018,Venom is definetly not unenjoyable it just has quite a few major problems with it. I felt the script was very rigid and did not seem natural from the actors it also contridicted itself multiple times. Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams chemistry on screen was probably one of the worst I have ever seen you can also clearly see Tom Hardy pretty much playing himself for a majority of the film. Their was very little backstory and contects for the film making it very hard to follow and understand. I have to give it though to Riz Ahmed who did give a truly good performance and was one of the few charaters you could really connect with on screen,Venom
3291,khandakarsayeem,Brilliant Movie - IGNORE THE FREAKING CRITICS,10,5 October 2018,This movie is just fine. I have no idea why the critics are making it look bad. Loved it.,Venom
3292,kondorheros,It's not bad at all,8,7 October 2018,"Just out from watching Venom, it's not bad at all, but it can be better, don't compare it with other MCU movies. They should make it rated R just like Deadpool, it seems Sony try playing safe by make it PG-13, maybe to get wider audience or plan to make venom joining MCU like Spiderman did.
Some critics said it was Catwoman's bad, well it is not, it is way better.
Tom Hardy is likeable as Eddie Brock, but other characters need more depth. Looking forward to Venom 2 & hopefully Sony make it rated R.",Venom
3293,harley_d-03702,Forced to Watch This,1,23 December 2018,"I don't mind a good comic book movie, but the best part of this movie was Eminem's track in the final credits.",Venom
3294,finlaydouglascrowe,"A fun, entertaining watch.",8,4 October 2018,"I've been excited for this film ever since it was announced. I was disappointed at the negative reviews the film has been receiving from critics but did not let their opinions impact my enjoyment of the film. Venom is a great watch. Fantastic action, a solid performance from Tom Hardy and a breath of fresh air to finally see the character done justice. At points the script was slightly weak and I think the film could have benefited from an R rating however I would thoroughly recommend this film.",Venom
3295,ak-12673,#We Are Venom,10,6 October 2018,"It's really osm movie with tom Hardy performance.
best action horror movie
Don't know why critics review low on rotten tomato.
But this deserve something 75 prsnt ratting..
So please ignore critics review.
Nd watch this movie now...
Sure after watching this movie
You'll be so happy",Venom
3296,despoinoulakara,Amazing,10,27 December 2018,I usually don't like action movies involving heroes or monsters or etc but this one was awesome. I didn't get bored at all,Venom
3297,henricwahlgren-27139,Really disappointed,5,1 March 2019,"Not gonna go into details. Just very underwhelmed. No real charm, not a great story or script. Had high hopes! Feel robbed on a potential great film",Venom
3298,lexmunn,Fresh take,9,6 October 2018,"I saw critic reviews and they are all wrong. I don't quite see what they didn't like about this movie. It is pg13 when it was intended to be R. However, they still did a good job with that. Characters are awesome. Great humor. Great movie overall. Not too rushed and the plot isn't difficult to follow.",Venom
3299,bluebirdataz,The critics was expecting too much for a superhero movie,9,5 October 2018,I get so fed up with critics comparing this movie to the rest of the MCU movies. Most critics are saying this movie is bad because there's no spiderman but it's still possible to make a great venom movie without spiderman. I think sony got this one right and they were smart about it too. I believe sony not including spiderman was a tactic in case the movie didn't do well then it wouldn't effect the MCU at all. Sony does plan to get venom and spiderman to meet in the future so then we need to see this film with that in mind. Sony is building up to that moment and so what better way then to keep spiderman and venom distant for the moment. MCU does this very well and has been doing this since the beginning with the ultimate meetup on the avengers. This movie gets me excited for the next venom movie and ultimately the spiderman vs venom film. Aside from that this movie is hilarious and stays true to the comics (I'm referring to the venom comic) I feel when this movie hits bluray we will get the unrated edition which may show the 30-40 min that was cut from this film. Please do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It was so fun and I may end up watching it again on a Tuesday ($5),Venom
3300,christopherballard,Finally Doing Venom Justice!!!,10,5 October 2018,Well I'm not a film critic but I am a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as well of Venom and the story of the symbiotes this movie is a awesome portrayal of Venom and the symbiotes and does them justice so if you're into spiderman or the venom saga this film is a MUST WATCH!!!,Venom

This is a wake up call!
Dude you can't judge every movie by the reviews, you gotta take risks and go with ya buddies, shame you didn't came :(. -Review
The movie is good, solid, funny, there are some dumbo parts but its enjoyable, Tom Hardy is excellent. Give it a try.",Venom
3302,kpvenom,Don't listen to others,10,6 October 2018,I've always had an open opinion to all movies. I had low expectations for this movie. I left that theater in awwww! I loved it! I'm a huge Venom fan. Probably the biggest you will meet. Spider-Man 3 upset me with their interpretation of venom. Just awful. This wasn't! Tom hardy did it right. Tom hardy was amazing and the story kept me glued! Go see it and be the judge!,Venom
3303,jonlhicks,Crictics no longer relevant!,9,22 October 2018,"Yet again another movie that the crictics get so wrong!
After watching The Last Jedi a movie prasied to the heavens by crictics that is just so appalling in so many ways, (I won't go into it because I'll never stop lol) not only as a Star Wars movie but as a stand-alone film itself I have taken to completely ignoring crictics reviews, and I'm so glad I did.
The numbers don't lie! (take note Kathleen Kennedy!) Venom is a hoot!
Yes it's a bit slow to get going, as often origin films are, but it's a good story and everything comes together well.
Tom Hardy is brilliant as both Eddie Brock and Venom as is his nemesis Riz Ahmed.
It's Dark and yet humorous, as expected from these kind of superhero movies the effects are superb and I had tremendous fun watching it.
It's to easy nowadays to put films down on the ""I've seen it all before"" line, I say go see for yourselves! Enjoy.",Venom
3304,tiangkla,Dont listen to the critics..go see it yourself!!,8,6 October 2018,"I dont write this review just because I have to...but more like, its my moral obligation to say it to those who enjoy movies to go and watch it yourself and see it if its worth your time and money!This is not an oscar material movie but if you just wanna watch the movie, have fun and see a better venom than that of spiderman 3 then this movie is for you.",Venom
3305,benlatraabc,You should see venom,8,10 October 2018,Don't listen to the critics. The movie has strange pacing i will agree with them on that. But if you go into this movie not expecting it to be weird then your doing it wrong. Sony did the best they could adapting a character as weird as venom. Tom hardy did great and he acted how you or I would have acted if we got taken over by a symbiote. The only other complaint I have is that it takes a little while to get going. However that set up the character of Eddie Brock very well. If your a fan of marvel or venom this is a must.,Venom

3310,mailjoella,unoriginal,3,30 May 2021,"The storyline wasn't even that interesting & unoriginal. No cute guys. Venom looks ugly. I didn't find it that funny either. The fact that there's a secret hidden laboratory, the way the symbiotes look, and that it didn't go as planned and one of the symbiotes escape and wanted to find a host; the entire concept is similar to stranger things to me. Like when the demogorgon used will as a host so his friends had to use heat to get it out of him cause it couldn't withstand the high temperatures, something similar happens in this movie too. The symbiote can't withstand high temperatures & frequency. Both the symbiote & the demogorgon also wanted to take over the planet.",Venom
3311,singhdevraj-83525,Too good..,10,6 October 2018,"In my opinion, the movie is extremely underrated. It is a great balance of sarcasm and action but the soundtrack could have been better.. And in my opinon, it's a must watch..",Venom

But a friend of mine urged me to watch it. I enjoyed the movie and it was nothing like what critics said. The movie introduced a total badass venom in a good origin story. The action sequences are great, CGI is fine and except a few plot holes the movie is a perfect live action adaption of your VENOM.",Venom
3314,shadowgone,Me and my girlfriend love this movie,10,13 October 2018,I just recently saw venom and the critics are wrong this movie is epic and it's got the best cgi I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of movies. So the bad reviews going around are lies. My review the movie has promise more then most movies today. So give it a chance it's like the Deadpool movie many thought it would fail and it didn't so see this movie. And stick around after for the post credit.,Venom
3315,blackrabbittreasures,"Terrible, awful, just bad",1,22 February 2019,"I'm a big fan of Tom Hardy, but this movie is just awful. From the bad story to the mediocre fx, it's hard to pin point exactly where they went wrong. Someone mentioned that they nailed venoms look. Well, he didn't have that look until he took over Spider-Man. This movie tried to make venom into a good guy, which he is not. The same with Eddie Brock. He was a d-bag from day one. Please, do yourself a favor and skip this trash.",Venom

3317,grules-51328,Enjoyable,7,8 October 2018,"This movie is formulaic and the resolution arrived sooner than it should've and that's all the negatives really. Otherwise the movie is enjoyable, its funny, thrilling and creative and you shouldn't expect it to be too comic accurate other than the chemistry between Eddie and Venom. Overall its entertaining but don't expect it to knock your socks of or you'll be dissapointed.",Venom

I felt the pace of this film was great and the bonding and (or) chemistry between Tom Hardy (Eddie brock) and venom was hilarious and all I expected it to be.

He is one of the best actors today, and he just does an incredible interpretation every freaking time! You can put him in any kind of movie, he will make it even better because of his genius and intelligent acting skills.. Very talented, very emotional, in every role, he is just like another person..goes deep inside a character I just love it!

3327,JohnTex426,Did not live up to Venom,1,18 February 2019,"All in all this movies sucked. I've read a bunch of reviews that left me feeling like maybe I watched a different movie. The plot was incredibly weak and it seemed like the actors felt that way too because the scenes between Tom and Michele felt awkward.The visual effects were the best part of the movie as well and the odd relationship they made with ""Eddie"" and the symbiote but the whole thing just felt like Sony needed the cash grab or maybe needed to make this to keep the rights to the character.
In reality I'd say this was a 5/10 because the effects were great and the symbiote looked cool but I had to give this a 1 because as a fan I thought it did Venom no justice and honestly comic book movies are not what they were 20+ years ago. There have been excellent comic book movies made these last 10 years that have set the bar very high and this one never even came close.",Venom

No background on ""this planet of symbiotic beings"", no background on Venom or how he/it can know things like 'sarcasm'... the jokes were forced or lazy at best... when the punchline to a joke is the word ""p***y"", come on, please give some effort. You can't just take the Marvel name and throw a movie together, completely ignore the rest of the Marvel universe and expect movie goers to like it... but based on rating and other reviews I guess you can. I regret giving any $ to the cinema to watch this movie... don't wast money, free cable movie at best, and thats from someone who's favorite movie is Infinity Wars.",Venom

Anne was a little off but they will fix that in the next movie. This movie was great there was a lot of story and little less action than I wanted but there was enough venom to go around.

3342,alexanderop,"Great movie, don't listen the critics.",9,6 October 2018,"I liked it from the start to the very end. I was like a child when I was heading to the theater.
I had expectations, and they have been satisfied. The movie is great, the mix of comedy, action and horror fits very well, the way they introduce Venom to Eddie is not that great, but how they react with each other, how they make a relationship during the movie, IS GREAT. I can't believe I was laughing in the theater, I was raising my arms of excitement and I was about to cry aswell.",Venom

3344,mrmarufahamed,It was quite good.,9,9 October 2018,"Don't listen to the critics whom are desperately trying to remain relevant in a time where the opinion of the audience truly matters.The movie is genuinely good. What it isn't is fantastic however.-buildup. The intro of the movie was fine. Nothing spectacular but certainly progressed the story into the right direction. Though it did linger on for a tad bit too long.-The plot while amusing, is definitely lacking and drops the ball at least at a certain point, which i cant really dive into here due to spoilers. This certainly is the biggest problem with the movie. -CGI. Not great but certainly far from bad! -Venom. The symbiote is awesome and i loved the bonding with Tom Hardy's character which truly moved the movie forward. Definitely the strongest point within the movie and was eager for more!-Overall. Ignore the damn paid critics. They are a dying breed and should've been put out of their misery years ago. This movie is entertaining. While i was disappointed with the lack of a true dark tone, it wasn't all pure comedy either. it was a decent balance.Check this movie out for yourself and vote accordingly. This movie deserves that at the least.8/10",Venom
3345,aiko-65378,Wow,10,6 October 2018,The movie is awesome. Seriously worth every penny to go to the movies!! There was not a single moment I didn't like and I'm not a big supefan hero fun. Tom did a great job. Go guys!! I recommend imax 3D. It's super impressive,Venom

However I love movies and I watch a ton of them and I truly don't understand the hate for this movie I see people giving it. I was lucky to see this movie a day early and I loved it. There were ton of funny bits and tons of scenes that had me on the edge of my seat. My only complaints are that the second act is a little slow and the cgi for the last fight is a little much. The villain isn't the best but I have seen a lot worse. But the relationship between Ed and Venom was great. Sold movie can't wait for the next one!,Venom

3352,scottip-36704,Dissapointted,3,14 October 2018,"I was so excited for this film and with a huge star I thought it would be one of the all time great marvel films, but for me it wasn't.
I thought venom wasn't evil and scary enough, he was more of a jokey loveable character much like spider man. He wasn't the villain we all know and love but the hero instead.",Venom
3353,sarahjlappin,Ok but nothing new or special,5,5 October 2018,"Over all the film is a somewhat enjoyable film, no where near as bad as some other sites are saying. However Venom is a simply forgettable film as it follows a super safe and generic formula that we have all seen before. The cast is pretty good and there is a bit of humour all tho it's hit and miss and sometimes feels rather out of place. I was surprised that there was a few scenes where it was slightly more graphic than expected for the rating drop, However it definitely could have been a better representation of Venom if they went for a R rating and it very much feels like that was the original aim.My biggest issues with Venom are the completely overdone safe plot and that later fight scenes especially fast moving ones have a lot of motion blur and I found it pretty hard to follow, I could tell what was going on but the detail was completely lost to me.",Venom
3354,lewisjustin,Awesome!,10,6 October 2018,I believe that this was a great movie. It really brought one of the main marvel villains to live and showed a different side of the marvel universe. Best villain film I've ever seen in a long time. I'd hate to call him a villain because he's more of an anti hero. But I loved it. Great marvel movie!,Venom

3357,shaunbrown-92158,WE ARE VENOM AND WE ARE BRILLIANT!!!!,10,7 October 2018,"I just watched Venom and by god I loved it. It was by far way better than some marvel films i have seen. The characters of Eddie brock and Venom (played by Tom hardy) have amazed me and are far better than the ""venom"" & ""Eddie brock"" in Spiderman 3. Not only that but it gives us a great relationship between the former journalist and Alien Symbiote. Despite Spider man not being involved in their origin like every other interation of the characters and they might be my favourite Eddie and Venom of any media even the older cartoons or comics. The story was fun and it was thrilling at times and also had some great comedic moments. There were times where I was either on the edge of my seat or struggling not to burst out laughing while in the theatre.OVERALL this is a fun film to watch and sure it isn't perfect only 1 or 2 problems but other than that I'd give it an 10 just for being a fun film and giving one of my favourite characters of all of media the spotlightCan't wait for a sequel!!!!!",Venom
3358,freezerboo,I expected everything I got nearly nothing,1,12 October 2018,"I don't usualy read critics first but this time I have, and a lot of people here was saying it's one of the best movie in a while, and I wanted to trust them... I was really disappointed.
Venom is supposed to be a super vilain or a anti-hero if you want, but here he was just a hero as we saw them since 3 decades... it remember me Suicide squad, a movie where every vilains are transform into normal super heroes...
The origins stories of venom with eddy was already good, (The one in Venom Dark Origin which is not so far from the one
Spiderman 3 ) we could have seen a new point of view, with a charracters who have to make bad things to defend the inocent, fight crime in a questionable way, take his revenge on a system that let him down, where there is not everything black or white, more like the punisher or the vulture. But here it's more like another spiderman but the poorest one. Only few scene understand the fact that venom is not supposed to be a toy... I know sony couldn't use spiderman but they could have change it a bit the originals story not transforming everything imto fairies tails.
Fortunately Tom hardy play good but he can't save the movie. 
But even him declare that the best scene were deleted from the movies, like 30-40 min ... and I don't think he is wrong about it. They just wanted to down the movie to a pg-12 in order to brings kids but they are not the only one warching movie. 
I have to admit I like most of the actions scene because I like superheroes movies but this time we were supposed to see something more, something more mature, darker, and that's why I'm so desapointed...I will explain my point by pointing point of the story so don't read the following things if you care about the ""story"" I can't spoil more.The ten first minute were good, we were expected to a symbiote ( that we will called evil symbiote because he got no name) just trying to survive and adapt to this new world and that what we got ! 
You could fear somethings. What does it want ? It's searching for something but what ? But after this everythings became like every generic superheros movies, all the story is predictable : 
The evil guy have a big company that keep 3 symbiotes and hide it to the people. The nice hero, eddy, live in a peaceful place, he defend good things because it'a a good guy. So he wanted to do a good things : denunces the bad guy without proof but it sadly it return against him and he lost his peaceful world I have to mention the unbelievable worst love story they try to put here. He was about to mary her and she left him for this one misstake which was a big one (they lose their job both because of it) but the begin seems to show us, their was a true love between them, and less than 6 month later she already has a complete new life with another man. And please if it was so hard for her that she left him like nothing why did she seems like she still care of him after this, it doesn't make sense ...She is just Eddy's love interest during all the movie ! We could have been a stories without her it wouldn't have change anythingsAfter it you will see that the bad guy is realy bad : muhahahah he doesn't care to kill people because he is so evil muhahaha...
But as always some scientist around him aren't that bad and need to tell everythings to the good guy. In order to give him some proof she will show him the hidden lab, because if she don't the good guy will never been infected by the symbiote. Like every time this stealth is a success because their is no camera in all this high secure bassement ... but Eddy who was taking photos ""accidently"" free a symbiote, Venom, which decide to take his body as a host ...
Here we got pretty good scene which were fun. But the story still be the evil that seek for the good guy because he got his symbiote ... The visual effect showing the simbiote was cool, and we got just few scene where we can see that they wanted first to do a good movie. The symbiote was evil he doesn't care about killing to defend himself (it's not a rated movie so he just hit them hard with no blood like every superheroes and eat two nicely) and he also want to get the control of its host act. But 5 sec after a dark speech between Venom and Eddy, where Venom tell him he is dangerous and want to eat things alive, they became bbf, and he help him with his ex girlfriend :
 This scene was rly akward : - Venom tell Eddy, he knows everything his host know. But just one second after he doesn't know the name of the good guy ex girlfriend, I don't know how in a so expensive movie you can tell a rules and break it just one second after it. Ans after it Venom accepted to come to the hospital ? Why ? He heard that Eddy love interest wanted to heal Eddy which means separate Eddy to him ... And he has already experiences that he doesn't like the hospital because of the high frequency signal ...
So they expose it to him and Venom had to escape to Eddy's body... wow so unexpected ! Why sometime when the history need it Venom have to be dumb... The evil symbiote came to the secure basement (I won't say this time it is crasy because the fact that he knew everything in the head of every host he got could have send him here and we know some people he get into worked for the evil guy) and he take the body of the evil guy to become the evilest things with obviously the evilest plan : they want to go to the symbiote planete with a rocket and came back to infect all the humains with the symbiote found there.During these time one of the evil guy man find Eddy and bring him to the evil guy, seeing that he hasn't Venom in him he decided to order his mans to kill Eddy. But it's a hero movies so he can't die, so they don't shoot him in the secret lab were a lot of people were already dead and they decided to kill him in a forest and to tell him long stories before shooting him, in order to give time so the good symbiote can save him.
Can somebody explain to me why venom wanted to find eddy if it's not just for the plot ? He is a smart symbiote he doesn't need this guy exactly any other could do the same. In the comics If I remember they have to be like accepted by the host to live more longer but we haven't see something like it. On the contrary we saw Eddy happy to see Venom out of his body... And how does he go exactly to the same place of a big forest ?
So Venom merge with Eddy and save the planet with him because it's magic ! 
As always it finish with a fight between a lot CGI.it's not even disney who made this one so why is venom transform into a princess ? Could we have another mature rated heroes movie ? Or wlll we have to eat these washed movie for another decade ? But giving these movie good mark we encourage people to make more of these, I'm really expected they won't do it for Spawn too. I just want to remember they sell us Venom as the darkest ever marvel movies, and that why I give a mark so low.
The evil symbiote is called Riot but haven't heard him in the movies ...
Sorry for the long post but I have no potatoes.",Venom

3363,mcdonyleea,Amazing Anti-Hero Movie !!,8,4 October 2018,The movie is way better than the previous venom on spider-man 3. The CGI is very good especially when the scene where venom fights riot and car motocycle chase is very amazing😂. The movie is greater than its trailer ! Don't listen to anyone who said that this movie is bad. Just watch it ! It's really worth it for those who likes spiderman universe and venom itself!,Venom
3364,amadkq,Film was good but too short,7,20 October 2018,"Venom was actually a good film from the beginning, however there wasn't much time given to the final fight. It felt like they just rushed the ending of the film. That's because the film is too short. 115 mins (1 hr 45 mins). I think there should be some few more scenes before the final battle. IMAX experience was ok but not the best. Overall the film was good, all the actors were great (Tom hardy especially) and all fights and cgi were cool. The only problem was the story and the runtime of the film.",Venom
3365,kevinjpalacios,We are Venom,9,5 October 2018,"I get out pf the theater thinking ""this movie is the most real fictional character"". At the beggining you can just wonder where is Venom, but then you just realize that the pacing of this movie is just right. You get the chance to see and understand Eddie's character while we get a little bit of jokes throughout the beggining of the movie. The interaction between Venon and Eddie is amazing. Is a really solid scrip, but that final lines almost at the end between Venom and Riot, but the action is on point and the cgi, at least in 3D, looks stunning. It had some flaws, it could had been more ""venom on screen time"" movie, but at the same time is understandable that is an origin movie. The mid credit scene totally worth it. Its hard to believe, but yeah, sony made a good movie this time.",Venom

It's a good movie, don't let critics make you think twice to watch this movie.
I enjoy the story, but when the story reach its peak, I felt something wrong, I can't describe it, it just felt like something is wrong, there is something that this film don't have, a little thing that makes me ask myself ""I feel it, there's something gone from this film, but what is it ?"" when the movies over.

I don't usually write reviews but this movie was awesome and fun to watch. If you are going expecting a serious movie, you will not enjoy it. It was a lot funnier than I first anticipated and you can tell that Tom Hardy gave this movie all he got, it was AMAZING. The only thing I didn't like was the pacing. The story kind of moves along at a weird pacing. I think it's because of the 30 to 45 minutes that we're cut out. They should of gone for the R eating.",Venom
3369,mickeg-26698,Brings something new to the table...,8,7 October 2018,"Although this movie has it's moments when they are pushing the comedy between Venom and Hardy this movie was a little different from the other marvel movies, The story is kinda weak about the other millions of symbiotes/monters there were and where they come from, they said a comet and stuff about it but a little more detail would have been more interesting because marvel are creating this movie of venom and hardy, but you can easily relate more to the human than venom, venom said something like: i was kind of a loser on my planet too and we are quite alike. That ruined the movie more for me, I know marvel reaches out to all the audience ages but making Venom seem like a complete dork while eating humans made it more of a parody rather than a ""scary"" experience, they combine comedy with horror and make it seem like it's working but it kinda doesn't, they are just making a joke of themselves. Positives about the movie is that it's the first anti hero movie and i am liking it more than the superheros with the same purpose over and over again.
The CGI is good and fighting and choreography in the scenes were nice and they didn't go as far as Thor ragnarok on the comedy lines.
Venom as the character was well intimidating considering children will watch it but I want to talk to them about there movies and what they think of when they are doing them. Pushing everything isn't always what the audience wants although the people want to see action and be entertained they must do a limit on some things in the movie.",Venom

3391,dianafiona-76558,This might contain spoilers,6,20 October 2018,"I appreciate their take on the character that is Venom. The moral dilemma behind the symbiote revolves around the gray area involved in a scientific conglomerate jumping the gun on human testing for something that is necessary for humanity to survive on another planet. Taking a more ""casual viewer"" approach, the human symbiote relationship is almost funny. The lovable side of Eddie Brock could help the viewer overlook his lack of ambition and vision, as he deals with the loss of his woman and the gain of an alien organism.
Personally, when Carlton Drake marched into the Life Foundation and no one said anything about THE ALIEN SYMBIOTIC ORGANISM THAT ESCAPED and he was forced to ASK why they were so quiet...I actually talked during a movie for the first time in years. It is most likely a pet project of Drake (again, playing the causal viewer here) and so anyone that has a sense of social etiquette would know enough to contact the PI (Principal Investigator) to let him or her know just in case some of the experiment can be salvaged. *sigh* Cue the visions of late nights at the lab and talking to the rats whose movements were being recorded as they ran around their cages.
The kiss between Eddie and Anne when under the influence of the symbiote was touching. Hopefully Eddie will make up for all the times he lied to his woman fi he actually does want her to take him back.",Venom

3394,brenpaddycork,Enjoyable but a complete mess,4,9 October 2018,"This movie was a total missfire for Sony. They took a great character and turned it into ""a turd in the wind"". Tom Hardy sounded like he wanted to give a good performance but the direction is so bad I don't think anyone could pull it off. Riz Ahmed was terrible as the villain. He was bland and stupid and he claims he cares about life and the survival of the human race but his experiments kill people. Michelle Williams is such a good actress and she had nothing to work with in this movie. We see Eddie and Anne's relationship for 10 minutes and then they break up and it feels fake because we've had no time to show that these people loved eachother. Anne Weying has nothing to do but whine and moan and only at the end does she become useful when she ""fight's ugly"". This movie isn't all bad however as Venom is the one character done right. His back and forth with Eddie is great and he really gives this movie a light hearted dark comedy tone. He is the one character who feels truly heroic as he chooses to help the human race instead of taking it over. Riot was stupid in the movie. He stays latched onto an old woman for 6 months which is totally ridiculous and then he only becomes relevant in the third act. When he does come out he is great and his fight with Venom is fun albeit bogged down by CGI. Overall, this is a mess of a movie. I won't be watching it again in theatres but I will buy it when it comes out because it is fun to watch.",Venom

My girlfriend and I didn't find any scene unnecessary or slow, and it didn't move overly fast. Venom was near perfect in both character and design. The bonding between Brock and Venom was charming. Honestly couldn't find anything wrong. We're picky about our movies and like to tear them apart. Only reason I give it just 9 stars was it could've used a little more venom.",Venom
3400,lauch-44997,Gladly surprised,10,11 November 2018,I almost didnt go watching the movie. And I'm glad I took the chance despite the critics. The movie is funny very well made and Tom Hardy is on top of his art! Honestly I definitely recommend it and I would even go back to watch it a second time,Venom
3401,jpientok,Great intro to Venom,8,5 October 2018,This movie was an absolute fabulous surprise and a nice introduction to Venom - just in case you shouldn't know him already ;-).,Venom
3402,eddiematt,Critics are talking bs,9,6 October 2018,Very different to any other superhero film. Had the perfect mix of humour and action and props to Tom Hardy for making the character of Eddie Brock a genuinely likable character.,Venom
3403,eksleigh,SPOILER ALERT!!!!,8,3 October 2018,"Overall this movie was very entertaining and a solid example of a darker comic book movie. SPOILERS! for all you marvel fans out there, I can tell you, Carnage is not in this movie. He does make an appearance in the mid credits scene as Cletus Cassidy and is played by Woody Harrelson. The only named symbiotes in the film are Venom and Riot. The final end credits scene is just a teaser for 'Into the Spiderverse' so don't bother staying to watch. And lastly, the Stan Lee cameo in this film is probably one of the better ones in all the films!",Venom
3404,zekemcloud,"Venom messy, but fun",8,8 October 2018,"Venom is a very interesting superhero movie. Here are my thoughts, hope they help. Okay it's not the prettiest movie. Action scenes are a bit chaotic, the visual effects are just barely good enough to look real, and The Life Foundation just wasn't doing it for me. But on the other hand, it was hilarious! Just the conflict between Brock and Venom was so funny. I gave this a 8 mainly because of the comedy. I will be seeing this again soon.",Venom
3405,Shadowflame_777,Good Not Great!,8,6 October 2018,The movie still needs Venom's dark & twisted humour.Although it's a pretty decent watch but as a comic book reader I found it good but not that great as it is still miles away from the original version of Venom.But you're gonna enjoy if you haven't read the comics yet.,Venom
3406,adillaoppo,Awesome,10,5 October 2018,"Very interesting way to present this movie.
poor CGI and some storyline gaping. overall its a fast paced movie.
really enjoyed it.
don't listen the critics.
highle recommend 👌",Venom
3407,kyhgoot,Honestly Critic's ngative reviews actually made me think this is good movie,9,18 October 2018,"I saw rotten tomato gave this movie 31% tomato meter. 
Well Venom deserved at least 60% I think. Go see it !",Venom
3408,arukado-20585,Tom is amazing actor,8,11 January 2019,"It's worth to see 10/10
U should watch it
I may watch it again",Venom
3409,ashleighbennett-51958,Critics are all mongs... ignore them!!!,9,22 October 2018,"Did the critics even watch the same movie? I wasn't expecting much when I went in but I was very surprised. The comedy really made the film for me, it would have been no where near as good without it. It may not be perfect but it is one hell of a good time.",Venom
3410,kennystiles,Awesome...,6,11 October 2018,"This was an outstanding movie, given WAY to much hate by the critics",Venom
3411,cmonster-10277,Must see!,9,6 October 2018,Ignore the critics this movie was fantastic and completly exceeded expectations! This movie had lots of humor and the banter between Eddie and Venom was some of the best parts.,Venom
3412,backtobrent,I love it,6,10 April 2019,Look I can't give it a ten because this is not close to a good film. In actuality this movie is a 4 star movie. But it's so much fun. It is a movie that doesn't require me to know everything about every other movie before it. This movie is also extremely fun and I love it for that reason.,Venom
3413,willekesmatthijs,Fun to watch!,10,5 October 2018,"I never write any reviews, but since the score of the movie is so low i just wanted to give my opinion. Yes i have rated this movie a 10 to up the score, but honestly its probably a good 8.I was a bit worried cos of the bad reviews, but it was a fun movie with a good build up, funny moments, an amazing Tom Hardy and an awesome Venom. The story was a bit so so, but to my opinion none of the MCU of DC movies has an amazing smart storyline. Except for the dark night that is. So pls go watch it wihtout too many expectations and you will probably enjoy it a lot.",Venom
3414,manbro-86154,Amazing? Yes. Perfect? No.,10,24 October 2018,Hardy and Venom's chemistry is absolutely the best part of the movie. I don't get why the critics hate it so much. Sure there are some boring parts but what movie doesn't have those? Do yourself a favor and go see it! I want a sequel and make sure you stay for the end credits,Venom
3415,birkopdal,"Good ,but most see inn 4d and 3d",10,6 October 2018,"....you know, it's good when you watch the start ,it builds up .",Venom
3416,lmasonadamsl,Very well done movie.,9,5 October 2018,"This movie is great. It had a great suspenseful theme for Venom. Venom looks light years better than the Spider man 3 venom. Yes the movie had a few flaws, but it's not that critical. One was the story felt a bit rushed, if you were not a fan of comics and you didn't know much about Venom, you probably will get lost. The movies CGI was extraordinary. I would definitely watch it again.",Venom
3417,zolaabel,Great Movie,10,7 October 2018,I don't understand the critics! I spent a good time watching this movie.,Venom
3418,randavesbains,Not my cup of tea,3,3 October 2018,"I don't know. The movie felt a tad bit empty to me at least, the plot was very anti climatic, and though rather amusing at times, I don't really get the hype over this movie. The cgi is better than I honestly expected, but I felt that the movie did linger too long in certain parts of the film.",Venom
3419,bobleponge-35509,Lost 10 dollars,1,8 October 2018,"I have no words, I was literally so excited about this movie (seeing the budget, the cast, MARVEL!) but I was so disappointed, it's very flat and boring. 
Doesn't deserves the good reviews IMO.",Venom

3421,tylerjnash,Not bad.,7,29 January 2019,Not an all time great. But this movie has carved itself a spot. I think it's simplicity is what worked in it's favor. Looking forward to the next installment.,Venom
3422,pattymcm,Excellent,10,8 October 2018,Love Tom Hardy playing Venom. I'm a grandmother enjoying the Marvel movies I love how they each lead to the next movie and I cannot wait 😀,Venom
3423,justaflashback,"Not the best, but pretty damn good",8,5 October 2018,"Although it suffers from some pacing issues, Hardy delivers a warm rendition of Eddie Brock in this film. The fact that Venom is NOT a superhero is very well made clear, and it works as a good foil of the perhaps-too-soft Eddie.",Venom
3424,isaac-11805,A great family movie,10,22 November 2018,"Well, this movie was funny and a glad to see and I think this movie diserves a good and nice balanced rating on my option",Venom

3426,jonasbaadsgaard-71869,Great acting from Hardy but..,5,8 December 2018,"Great effects, but paperthin plot and script make this movie ultimately forgettable. If you are a fan of Tom Hardy its watchable. Barely..",Venom

3428,lmlovejoy-50132,Good,8,12 October 2018,"Though people say its bad for the amount of cgi, what were they supposed to do? Its not like you can just make a shapeless pile of goo perminently form to fit one shape and change shape on command. Its a good movie no matter how much cgi it has.",Venom
3429,shaunlatelers,Venom is a fun film,7,5 October 2018,Venom was good film. Some of the script writing was meh. I like the relationship between Venom and Eddie. The CGI was great and I definitely like the fight scenes. Pacing was very slow in the beginning . But it eventually picked up. It was a fun movie to watch. I'll give the film a 7 out of 10. It wasn't a horrible piece of trash like the Critics are saying.,Venom
3430,roberta-52241,Amazing! Tom Hardy is perfect for Venom.,10,5 October 2018,Don't trust any negative comments because it's worth all the ten stars I gave it. It was fun and it was captivating. Go watch the movie and I hope to be here again very soon to comment another Venom movie.,Venom

3434,dliotino,IGNOR THE BAD REVIEWS,10,6 October 2018,"I totally thought that this movie was going to be a pice fo crap, but it was PERFECT. It has everything you would expect of an MCU movie which I am really hoping that they make it apart of it. The plot makes sense, the characters are relatable, there is the perfect amount of comic relief, there's a post-credits scene, and it is TOTALLY worthy of the Stan Lee cameo.",Venom
3435,ricardowynter,Simply beautiful,10,9 October 2018,"I know, it could have used a lil bit more gore, but come on, lets keep it PG. Well done, nice trama, good effects and well, its tom hardy. 10/10",Venom
3436,Dave_Nigh-T,Average but fun ride,7,7 October 2018,I pretty much enjoyed it. Loved the interaction between Venom and Eddie. It's worth seeing just because for that. Weakest point of the movie was the main villain. Hopefully we'll get Carnage in the next movie.,Venom
3437,momern,Ignore the Critics and Enjoy the Movie :),9,13 October 2018,"I know most critics are saying that it has no link to spider man but i consider it a good thing because if we add ""Spider-man"" in VENOM movie then whats the point of having VENOM movie in the first place we can get ""Spider-man"" movie with venom as villain in it , I totally enjoyed the movie and the story line and all the humorous action in it ,I went multiple times to watch this movie with family and friends and totally recommend it :) .",Venom
3438,jfashing,A Must See for Fans of the Spider-Verse,9,16 October 2018,"As a fan of the 90s era Spider-Man cartoon series, I have been waiting for a proper representation of Venom on film (The less we bring up Spider-Man 3's Venom the better). Tom Hardy definitely pulled his weight and was a perfect fit for this movie and you should watch for his performance alone. The plot and villain gets a little weak at times but it's not bad enough to take away from the overall feel and greatness of the movie.",Venom

Unfortunately it's look like this movie is for Marvel fan, since it's lack of character development, so it will be a little bit hard for non-fan to understand.

Venom is a good film with some very good scenes and I don't see why so many people are fussing over about it, it's like they're saying that Topher Grace's performance as Venom was amazing and it was terrible compared to Hardy's.

There are a lot of dumb things in the film and there are also great moments . Overall if you're a die hard fan of Marvel Comics and Venom then only this thing will entertain you, in short this film can be described as a turd in the wind !",Venom
3463,thehappyman,Good but,10,3 October 2018,Tom Hardy Gave an amazing performance as Eddy Brock. This movie had great CGI but was sadly weighed down by an under developed villain. But nevertheless a pure joy to watch,Venom

3465,danlewymusic,Ignore the critics,8,3 October 2018,"There's a lot of negative reviews circulating websites and social media. One of the comments I read in a popular critic was ""Spider-Man infection thingy"" which indicates immediately they know nothing about the character. Granted, this has took a different direction but I liked it.I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I thought Tom Hardy played the character extremely well. The introduction to the symbiotes was well done. Venom was a fantastic character and I really wanted to see more. Especially after what you see post credits (there's 2).A lot of reviewers say the script is a mess but it really isn't. It shows Eddies life, to turning to Venom and to them working together. It's a solid story, and one that I could watch again.The actors were brilliant, I can't fault any of that. It was fun, thrilling, exciting and has the right amount of humour in it. We saw Venom like we've never seen on the big screen, it was different but it was good.My only complaint is that the movie didn't feel long enough. We didn't actually see that much and that's my only complaint. If you're on the fence, go down and see it. I think this is just the beginning for a lot more amazing things to come.",Venom
3466,thedjsmaster,Truly Amazed with Venom,9,7 October 2018,"Around 4 hours ago, I went to go watch Venom. I think critics are giving this movie too hard of a time, from it's script to the different tones throughout the film. Personally I didn't have a problem with the script and the different tones helped progress the acts of Venom. Also, I thought the CGI was great (besides for at the end for like 10 seconds). This film truly hits home with the comedy (which is intentional, like I don't understand how people think some of the jokes are not intentional). Tom Hardy was on point with the interpretation of Eddie Brock and Venom. The relationship between the two is one of the best, if not the best, highlights of this film. Overall, Venom was a spectacular movie that hits on all cylinders for me. #WeAreVenom",Venom
3467,mpatterson-31034,Excellent film........ but,8,3 October 2018,"The film was great, funny and an amazing end credit scene (yes there is one!!!). I feel that the film should have been a little longer as it was just under 1hr 45mins long, it should have been minimum 2hrs just to fill in the gaps. I would highly recommend this movie.",Venom
3468,ufarese,Do yourself a favour...ignore the critics!,8,3 October 2018,We just came out of the theatre and I can honestly say. I liked it! It was funny and it paid great homage to the Todd McFarlane bombastic Venom era of the late 90's. It truly baffles me that Sony would not take enough risks to release the film with an R rating. I wonder how much of this film was left on the cutting floor!?! Tom Hardy's performance is also on point and...just go see it.,Venom
3469,firefox-68028,Venom is a great film that doesn't need to depend on the MCU or Spider-Man for its storytelling,8,4 October 2018,"Just to start I want to say my favourite super hero/ villain is venom so I may seem a bit biased but I tried to keep a level head going in and not let the fanboy out.My honest feelings were that the film is exactly what it needed to be. Thank god they didn't pull and amazing Spider-Man 2 and tried to set up a wider universe. Yes there is space too but I believe this film can stand as a stand alone movie.The opening to the point of Eddies first contact to me was really poor in the acting department and the story seemed very messy here however as soon as that symbiote hits it's full steam ahead! Tom hardy has always been an actor that I can really rely on in movies and after seeing legend, (an excellent film which I highly recommend) I had no doubt about his ability to form the two identities of Eddie and venom.The romance sub plot surprised me and I thought it was handled in a way rarely seen in superhero movies so well done on that. A big point of content was the jokes. Yes the ""turd in the wind"" line is a bit cringy but I think a huge amount of the jokes do hit home. For people who have seen the film a certain joke regarding an elevator that was short and sweet and had me genuinely laughing at it. Time to talk about venom himself! CGI on him is how I wanted venom to look in a live action version, that slimy, toothy, grinning look that looks like something straight from the comics.This film will definitely not be for those that aren't really into comics and I think this film may hit a special place in some fans hearts like me. At the end of the day I say go see the movie and see if you feel the same way. Something that I found really helped me was I went in not thinking of the MCU at large and Spider-Man at all and only when I was 1 hour in did I think ""I haven't thought about Spider-Man once!""To me venom is a surprisingly good film with some great action, visuals and comedy that occasionally stumbles, especially the clunky opening 30 minutes",Venom
3470,z-88492,Indifferent superhero movie,10,6 October 2018,"""You are mine."" ""We are Venom""This movie totally plays like Marvel movie.My god it is too funny and I think Venom is too cute.What's more,Tom Hardy is so so so good.I super love this movie and look forward to next Venom.",Venom
3471,sethfitzgerald,An interesting experience,4,4 October 2018,"The dark and edgy trailer for Venom was not what the movie really was, the movie turned out to be more of an action, comedy it was more like an adult spider-man movie. I was not impressed how they ended the movie with a very quick and rushed end fight scene and then cuts straight to Hardy and Williams have a fun chat about their future and how venom was gone. This movie was not what the trailer portrayed it to be.",Venom
3472,herdyscottkennedy,Not completely awful,7,4 October 2018,Dont expect best superhero film. But its worth for watch. You can still chuckle in some scene.,Venom
3473,stephensutandhi,Better than trailer and expectation,7,4 October 2018,"At first , I'm intrigued by the trailer, i mean it's proper symbiote stand alone movie, What's not to like?Mild spoiler alert, read at your own riskNow the Pros: 
By the flow of the movie the first one that charms me is Michelle Williams's Anne Weying. Her acting brings another good tone for the story. A girl that keep accepting Brock the way he is and a good interaction bits later with Brock and Venom in the movie. Next is CG, Well it's good CG action, enough Venom scenes (IMO), Sony nails it. Though it's amusing to know why there's no spider symbol in the chest. Third, is the interaction between Brock and venom. from fear into partnership i've seen a good part of it being comedic, else is somewhat so-so dialogue between a villain into anti-hero phase for Venom (which is a bit rare considering a turnover into anti hero)Lastly, The Venom itself. Interesting enough to see Venom has it's own characteristic and what the movie captured has enough charm to making me liking Venom itselfNow to be fair, the Cons:Slow Build up. I get that the movie what to show Brock background story, but i could see Sony could show this purpose in 15 mins less. The fans will prefer more Symbiote action, no ?Plot is somewhat predictable, Aliens coming to earth is not a rare theme. Also the villain exposure, the movie isn't even trying to cover it up. I guess it's lessen the tension for the ppl that watching it.Last and probably the most critical, It's PG-13. Venow was supposed to R rated, seeing from the comic and what symbiote is the movie should be more gory. I guess seeing the marketing purpose, Sony push this into PG. Would be interesting to see R rated Venom.That about my takes on venom. Now after seeing the movie, i've seen a lot of reviews trashing Venom. I would disagree for most of it. Try watching it yourself, for Spiderman and venom fans it would be nice to see sony take on this.A good movie, 7/10",Venom
3474,mojo_pchrr,Not as bad as expected.,8,4 October 2018,"Venom, while clearly lacking a few things does work, especially with its lead Tom Hardy/Eddie Brock. There is some serious charm to the Eddie/Venom relationship. Though some things didn't work, Venom the character was awesome and I had a great freaking time watching it. People don't realize Venom had a weird and silly sense of humor like in the comics and it was full on display in the movie. Overall, definitely not a turd in the wind or cat woman level bad as people say it was.",Venom
3475,kevinpickering-41172,Better then expected,8,4 October 2018,"Like many others I saw the vast amount of 1 and 2 star ratings from the critics slating this movie, but nevertheless it was 2 for 1 ticket day so went to see the movie expecting something as awful to the genre as Green lantern or Thor 2 as the critic reviews seemed to imply. However within the first 15 minutes I already found it entertaining it had some good points and built it's story decently well, The only place this movie lowers itself is once we reach the mid point where you can really tell they have cut far too much out of this film.Where once there were these little scenes to really give insight into the background you can sadly really tell where the Sony guys butchered this film down. Still the film has some good points, The Venom dialogues with Eddie are great, The final battle sequence is quite fast faced but a little messy again you feel like this could have been longer, Overall CGI is quite good too. If they make a second movie as their tease would suggest though that highly depends on how well it can do, They really need to work more with Marvel studios guys to hammer out the issues that come from Sony at the moment.All said and done it's a good base movie - it's not great, ground-breaking or amazing.. But neither is it awful as these others have suggested. Frankly it was fun and I had a good time so I would watch again.",Venom

Well, there's just one problem, and that's that it delivers very heavily on comic book lore that the general audience of these films may not 100% understand. As someone who's read the Venom comics, this film was perfect. However, there were many plot points that only really make sense if you've read the comics prior to seeing the film. Ignore the critics, see the movie, and read the comics. It makes the experience that much more enjoyable.",Venom

The CGI fights were nice except for the last part they could do better than that. The bad part is that it's not R-rated which kinda bad for a antihero who eats human brains.

The movie is great! Venom was funny and badass, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy's character) was an awkward loser, which played perfectly with Venom, and all the other actors really pulled their weight!

I'm not a movie critic, just an ordinary person that want to enjoy a movie (unless it's a bad one). I've seen reviews that said Venom has too many tones and a dull boring script. I disagree! Venom has its flaws, as in every movie but to say it's a VERY BAD movie, well that's just ain't right. I actually enjoyed it, as well as other people around me. The whole theater laughed at many scenes and that's not a bad thing. Sometimes a movie doesn't have to be too serious, if people finds it's enjoyable to watch it, the movie succeed. And Venom succeed in my opinion.",Venom

Unfortunately it didnt.
All im going to say is this film is really slow for the first 20 mins, then it gets over hyped bike chase scenes. It doesnt flow from scenes at all. Plot holes include eddie and anne being engaged, splitting up and amazingly she moves onto another guy in what seems like 3 days. Unbelievable! 
Non the less the cgi is good when venom is standing still but the final fight scene exposes the shoodyness.
Also the music is awful, they chose a terrible hip hop song and the main score is hardly used.
All in all i would give it a 6 and that upon reflection is being generous.
Save yourself some money and watch it for free on channel 4 in a few years.",Venom

3496,lewismcauleyjones,"Great acting, rushed plot",7,4 October 2018,"Tom Hardy does well to portray the relationship between Venom and Eddie Brock. The character set ups are done well with a great first third of the movie. As Eddie and Venom become one, it is interesting and a good watch to see action scenes- all of which are done well and something the film and CGI team can be proud of. Some true comic lovers may not appreciate the comedy elements, however I think this acts as a good device to set Venom apart in this universe. The film itself could have been longer, with the main plot seeming rushed as to Venoms purpose. I put this down to the need to spend time in character development during the film, and so, a sequel will hopefully be able to provide more on the plot front now that we have established the main character. Well worth a watch with an optimistic future.",Venom
3497,greggbruce-26101,"""Ignore the critics"" yall full of $hit",4,4 October 2018,"If you never followed venom before then by all means go ahead and say this was a good movie. Besides the fact that they got Eddies personality wrong. All the symbiotes showed up on the.... same spacecraft? What hapened to Venom giving off the 6 spawns? Did venom not get here cause of Spiderman? Venom was supposed to be a sick twisted monster who is seeking power. We get this ""bit of a looser from home planet"" thats trying to sympathize with brock and save his kind. 
The Cons:
The story is off
Venoms voice is beyond cheesy
Both venom and brock trying hard to be funny throughout the movie.

They use just the right amount of Comedy and serious evil villain to create an amazing movie. Tom Hardy has in my mind never been apart of a movie that was bad and he works great as Eddie Brock working with the sinister villain Venom.

3512,gustonbet,Anti-Venom (pun intended),5,5 October 2018,"This movie, the reactions and relationship Eddie and Venom have throughout reminds me of the movie Upgrade. But look, I'm going to be honest! I love the character Venom! Venom is one of my favorite villain turned anti-hero. This movie did have a lot of action which was entertaining and then it had a lot of boring scenes.That just wanted you to see more Venom and that's pretty much it. I had my worries about this movie when I first heard they weren't going to include Spider-Man. Sony could not deliver on a story that drove the passion and anger that the symbiotic relationship Eddie and Venom had for Spider-Man which was substituted by Carlton Drake. It just wasn't there. This movie just proved why Spider-Man is so important to this character. I mean I could be wrong with a different company besides Sony handling it. You will enjoy some, not all, the dialogue between Venom and Eddie. I actually hated Tom Hardy's portrayal of Eddie. Because in the comic's Eddie embraced Venom just as much as Venom embraced Eddie. Of course it was the sole purpose was to destroy Spider-Man, but still Tom Hardy's portrayal was a bit whiny and not really interesting. Venom himself is the only aspect of the movie I enjoyed. The story was flat. The supporting characters were very dull. You didn't really care for any character besides Venom. Btw HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. if you're familiar with the Lethal Protector series and other symbiotes that are formulated by the life foundation. The movie just uses cheap references and kills them off. Also the cliff hanger, I like Woody Harrelson, but not for Cletus Kassidy. All they did was slap a red wig on Woody Harrelson and called him Cletus. My favorite cast will forever be Michael C. Hall. Definitely a lot of bad writing in this movie. Some of it was with the jokes, Carlton Drake's demeanor, Riot taking 6 months to take a plane to come to the San Francisco (when you see the movie you'll know what I mean), and very cliche and predictableat times. I understand this movie would have done a lot more damage if was rated R, but they won't because their. Might be a possible cross-over of Spider-Man in the future. There was a lot of missed opportunities in this movie and a lot that needs to be improved. I can go a longer rant, but I think I'll just stop there.",Venom
3513,ajmcla,Very Cool,8,5 October 2018,"Such an unexpectedly fun movie. Not nearly as huge as the other ""Marvel"" movies, but understanding Venom is given a stand alone movie without Spiderman, they did a great job introducing Brock and Venom. Like most origin stories, it felt a bit slow at the beginning while I was waiting for Venom to show up, but it was worth it. The characters and action developed up until the end. Can't wait for the next one to come out.",Venom

3517,umfbroli,Better than expected,9,5 October 2018,"I went to see it, despite critic reviews, and I was happy I did. The movie was not strongly based on the comics, but it did bring a unique, and highly entertaining view on a character that would otherwise not be expected. Involved was quite a bit of humor, action, and moments where you found yourself leaning towards the screen in anticipation. I would definitely see it again soon. Highly recommend it.",Venom
3518,ethangarcia-63006,I love the superhero genre and comics but this is a TERRIBLE film,3,5 October 2018,"As a huge fan of the superhero genre I was excited to see venom. The issue with Sony brought my expectations lower, early reviews came in and some were mixed. If you like mindless entertainment then this film is for you, the story itself is weak and unfortunately makes Venom the jokester. It seems like the writers chose to copy Deadpool's style of quippy jokes and they insert it into Venom. There are some moments that are good, example the chemistry that is barely shown between Venom and Eddie Brock shines, it had me engaged. Yet the film quickly reverts to it's terrible jokes, and crappy story. The film shines when it keeps focus on its core character and his struggle, if they kept a serious tone then we would have a good film. If they had a serious tone and better told story this film would be great. Sad to see a terrible comic book related film make its way onto the big screen.",Venom
3519,leodengmy,I totally don't understand about critics reviews now,9,5 October 2018,"Are the critics the same kind of human being like me????? 
I totally don't think so.
How could they rate this movie a 33/100? 
I mean it's not 100, but at least 60 to be honest.(I rate it higher to get the average score better just to fail those people who intend to rate it lower, e.g. Lady Gaga fans. No offense, I love her)
I feel like the critics and I are not the same creature.
Probably like venom and Eddie.
Oh wait, venom and Eddie are friends but we are not.",Venom
3520,meenajoumaa,Ignore the IGNORANT Critics,10,5 October 2018,"This movie was perfect.
In all honestly, we all went in with low expectations due to how many horrible critic reviews there were. We still wound up going because we had purchased advance tickets.
The movie was Perfect. The only complaint maybe would have been the movie wasn't long enough (honestly, I was so into it, it felt under an hour, but it was actually 2.5 hours long almost). The jokes were funny, Venom looked amazing.
If you don't know anything about Venom you might not relate, but it was still enjoyable. Was disappointed before I went because it was not an R rated movie, but in all honesty, for what it is it still delivered. 
I highly recommend you see it for yourself and ignore all the negative reviews you have seen from people who have no idea what they went to watch.",Venom
3521,patrickconter,Defintely not as bad as critics think,8,5 October 2018,"The pacing is definitely pretty bad right at the start, as it's too slow and struggles to get on with the story as it wants to cover too much ground before introducing venom. Furthermore, when Venom finally appears, the film ramps up too quickly and some action scenes can leave you disoriented.Despite this, the relationship between Eddie and Venom is certainly one of the films high points, including Tom Hardy's fantastic performance as Eddie Brock. Action scenes between venom and humans are fast and exhilarating, but the final battle drops the ball in several places, inluding the cgi. Which at places can look really good and others seems distracting. Including when the symbiote is in its liquid state, which was an effect that Spiderman 3, a film more than a decade old, excelled at.The film is undoubtedly enjoyably from start to finish however and I hope to see a sequel in the near future with the R-rating it deserves so the film feels less cut down. Here's to hoping he faces Spiderman in the future",Venom
3522,toddbaertschi,EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS - MUST SEE,10,5 October 2018,"I have honestly no clue why the movie got such a horrible rating (from critics).
The movie was definitely worth watching. I almost didn't go due to all the negative critics. The movie was just awesome. Don't believe all the garbage from people who have no clue what they are talking about. See it for yourself.",Venom
3523,gabrielguillen,Seriously awesome and fun to watch....,10,5 October 2018,"The story was beautiful in such a way that it made me excited for every moment. I ended up caring about the main character, Eddie Brock, amazingly portrayed by Tom Hardy! There were many surprises, great visuals and brutal fights. Action packed and story driven.... I wish it would've been 3 hours long so we could've seen everything more in depth, but ya know..... budgets. Overall it was an amazing movie",Venom
3524,drewsilva-52188,DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS,8,5 October 2018,"It was awesome. 7.5-8/10. If you don't like Tom hardy or venom you'll hate it, otherwise it's a damn fun time. It is good for what it is in being that they didn't have the rights to add Spider-Man yet, and the story they had to create. It's dope for what they had especially the budget. You also can't take it too seriously being that it's a superhero/anti villain film so you just gotta enjoy it without being super analytical. There are plot holes but not enough to where I feel like it was bothersome. Overall for an original origin story & where it's STARTING, it's great. Idk why everyone was hating on it so hard, probably because it's weird in its own way and people don't like how weird it can get. You have to be open minded.",Venom
3525,matt-52496,Worth it,8,5 October 2018,"When reading reviews online before seeing the movie, a lot of people were against it, and a lot were for the movie. After seeing the movie with friends I can say that I personally sit in the middle, but leaning a lot towards loving the movie.First, I'll start with what the movie does wrong. The movie has a runtime of 2 hours and 20 minutes, and it feels like it spends a lot of that time wasted. The final fight between Riot and Venom didn't seem like it was the final fight, because comparatively, the movie only just seemed to be building up to its climax.It takes a long time for the movie to build up the relationship between Eddie and Venom, and the things set out against them seem to be made out to be way more than they really are. A large portion of the movies action scenes are running away from the same enemies, the police and Drake's henchmen. While yes the drones sent out do pose a threat due the fire exposure they can do, they aren't really a major threat. The one time a drone manages to actually hit Eddie/Venom, it simply makes Venom weak for like 5 seconds, before the movie continues.As far as the plot goes, it works almost all of the time and is great when it does, but the times where it doesn't, or it just seems like lazy writing, really let the story down. Personally, I haven't seen a lot of Spider-Man and don't know a lot about the Spiderverse. However, things like Venoms intentions seem a bit out of place. At first, Venom wants to use Eddie for the purpose of bringing back more symbiotes to take over Earth, but he then becomes good because he just likes Earth and Eddie? Surely even if Earth was taken over, symbiotes could still have their hosts, and therefore Venom could still have Eddie.Another thing that brings the movie down a little is Venoms character. At first, Venom seems entirely serious and that works great for him. This can be attributed to not only the audience but also Eddie not being comfortable with him yet, so there's a shroud of mystery as to what Venom is like, but it's still valid. After Venom is accustomed to being with Eddie though, the attempts at humour don't fit and most of the time aren't even funny. Tom Hardy has said that a lot of footage was cut from the film, including moments of dark humour and I just wonder if that's why we were left with poor attempts at making the viewers laugh.Now instead of whining about the film, I'm going to list why it is definitely a great watch, and how it's worth your time.The characters in this film are portrayed extremely well (with the exception of Venom at times). Carlton Drake is a great example of the actors doing their best. Drake is this great, dark, sociopathic character focused on the symbiote project and having almost no regards for other human life. Eddie is this wimpy, but good intentioned man dragged into the plot, and bonded with Venom, who brings up his good intentions to a heroic level. Anne is a very leveled character who is very un-two dimensional. There's a lot that can be said for every character and every actor, but in most cases, those statements are extremely positive.The animation in this film is amazing, I don't exactly know how to explain, but it is well done, and specific key scenes such as Venom/Eddie taking down the theif at the end of the film is amazing. There are times where the CGI is a mess of symbiote all over the screen, such as the fight between Riot and Venom, but any other time, it is very well done. Another part of the movie that is well done is the psychology between Eddie and Venom, but that's something that you'll have to watch the movie to truly experience.All in all, this movie is well worth your time, and is a great introduction to the new Venom, which will hopefully star in future MCU films. With the mid credits showing of Woody Harrelsons Cletus Kasidy, there is a evidently a lot to look forward to. Whether by yourself or with others, watch this movie.",Venom
3526,darkldragonoid,A humorously fun Ride to watch.,8,5 October 2018,"I came in with low expectations, after finding out its 30% on Rotten Tomatoes. Though it certainly exceeded my expectations at least, it still has its fair amount of flaws.

3531,kirstenlaitken-93842,Wicked spin-off story with obvious flaws but still amazing!,8,5 October 2018,"Don't listen to the negative critics, most of who clearly are not actual comic book fans and don't understand that this film is based on the comic book series Venom: Lethal Protector, in where Venom is less of a villain and more of an antihero.While it obviously had it's flaws (some issues with the pace of the film and some small plot holes or missing scenes that fans would have appreciated), it also had its pleasant surprises and impressive comic book accuracy at times. You've got to understand that this is a spin off storyline outside of the Spiderman universe and for what it is, it was incredible (in my opinion).Tom Hardy is an excellent candidate to play Eddie Brock, and was even more impressive on-screen. There were tie-ins to subplots of The Amazing Spiderman (and others) that made Hardy's portrayal that much more believable. So all in all, here's the thing, if you're a ""tator tot"" Spiderman fan, you're going to hate this film. If you're a hardcore Venom and comic book fan, like myself, this film may be a pleasant surprise.",Venom

3533,deepegcity,Amazing movie! Watch it!,10,5 October 2018,"Im a huge venom fan and i loved the movie, good representation of what venom should be like in a movie compared to spiderman 3. Tom Hardy killed it!
It was eventful, funny, and just plain epic! I loved it and i bet you will too!

It's fun to watch",Venom
3535,exiadf,Don't believe in critics,8,5 October 2018,"Before i watch this movie, my friends show me rottentomatoes rating. it seems prety bad.
but turns out, this movie actually better than my expectation.When this simbiote fallen to earth thanks to carlton drake rocket, some of them are missing.
the venom turns out stil in complete package. but i don't remember the others simbiote besides riot that eventually hosted in Drake body.
the venom showdown with swat team will be better if more blood spiled. and the chasing down between hardy & drake's men also could be better if they show venom kill those men brutally.
but, having riot as the main enemy + carlton drake seems too weak. battle between venom and riot should more longer.",Venom
3536,jaw-37148,This movie is better that it seems,8,5 October 2018,"This may not have Spiderman nor did not follow the comic book lore the best but it did bring some new tricks that may start a new movie series. For one thing, it gave the Venom symbiont a personality such as humor and the ability to care compared to the other movies with Venom that only care about feeding and revenge. I also kind of liked the plot but it can be improved. Too add to it, the symbiont-transformation scenes and really any time there was symbionts on screen were well made. And the last thing I would like to add is the movie's genre. In my opinion, action and comedy are the best kinds of genre in which this movie succeeded at adding both to the big-screen. In conclusion, I would watch this movie again and recommend this film to more people.",Venom
3537,kimberlyjluna,Don't believe critics movie is super good,10,5 October 2018,"When I went in, I went with low expectations on the movie due to the low reviews given by critics, the movie was super good really funny and didn't need a spiderman to be a good movie. Tom hardy projected a good eddie broock and an exellent Venom totally expecting a sequel",Venom

3544,maximsemail,Fun but flawed,6,14 October 2018,"To sum it up real quick, its good fun, but the movie is not well made. Villain is weak, action is mostly poorly shot and is in the dark (makes venom hard to see). Tom Hardy is the saving grace, he is having so much fun playing Eddie and voicing Venom. CGI is not great, but there is some practical action in there as well which is nice. When the camera isn't constantly shaking, the action is great, but it's usually shaking which is a shame. Overall, it gets somethings right, but has a lot of missed opportunities",Venom

3549,markuskarppinenmk,Not perfect but underrated,7,5 October 2018,"I think this film is highly underrated. Yes, it has some stupid moments but i had two hours of pure fun! Tom Hardy nailed his role as Eddie Brock/Venom. Give this movie a chance and go see it with open mind.",Venom
3550,areichmann-59915,Don't listen to the negative press on this movie!,10,5 October 2018,This movie was great! I was worried with all the bad press it was getting but once again it was found that the critics were wrong! I loved the performance of Tom Hardy and the symbiote looked awesome. I loved seeing venom kick some ass on the big screen. Do I wish it would have stayed rated R? Absolutely! I think they did the film a disservice by taking out the violence but hopefully there will be an unrated bluray! I could have also done with more fight scenes but who wouldn't? The end credit scene was amazing and has me super pumped! Definitely left with a Venom sized grin by the end of this movie! 1 satisfied fan,Venom
3551,ethanhoornstra,Best movie in awhile,10,5 October 2018,"Don't listen to the critics, the review for the movie was as far of as ever...it was extremely entertaining and funny as any marvel movie would be. In addition the leaks in the movie were so hype.",Venom

3554,HollieB123,Infectiously Funny,9,5 October 2018,Absolutely loved the film and definitely worth the hype and wait! Would definitely recommend ignoring the critics and going to watch it. Bloody hilarious. There was definitely a short story line which could've been expanded on more but that does not take away from how great the movie was. Tom hardy was excellent and left the whole cinema laughing all the way through. Definitely more of a deadpool style superhero movie. Can't wait for Venom 2 already.,Venom
3555,jrkermitxp,Not the worst Comic to Silver Screen film.,2,5 October 2018,"This movie is so not worth any of your time or money. The film was so badly edited I'm not sure if that was due to trying to get a PG-13 rating or the editor was just bad at piecing this film together. Tom Hardy was mos cast for this role and his acting was as bad as his ""Queens"" Accent. The jokes that were placed here and there didn't gain even a chuckle from the audience. The action scenes left me feeling like it was straight out of a power rangers episode on Fox. How do you mess up a car chase in San Francisco? It's made for car chase scenes. The back stories for Eddie Brock and Venom were so lame a fourth grader could come up with a better back story. Had they stuck with the idea of an R rated film then they could have done so much more also recast Tom Hardy.",Venom
3556,owencoulson,!!!A MUST SEE FOR MARVEL FANS!!!,9,5 October 2018,I am a lifelong marvel fan and it has been a long time coming for a PROPER Venom movie which really shows the diversity of the character. Tom Hardy was an amazing choice for the role of Eddie Brock and he really shows why he was chosen to play the part throughout the film. Plenty of humor which pleasently blends with the darkish undertones of the story. This movie is a true spectical for the eye and is easily one of the most enjoyable Marvel movies alongside the Avengers and Spiderman alike. You will get more than you bargained for! A must see indeed!,Venom
3557,vanesame,Perfect!,10,5 October 2018,"Don't listen to the critics, this movie is just perfect! Maybe the best of it's kind in 2018!",Venom
3558,e-66926,"uh...not perfect, not too bad",7,5 October 2018,"Technically, the plot is only about 6 points, and Tom's acting and CGI bring the extra 1. I can see how staff plan to do this: a 112-minute movie, so we just divide it into half and half: Eddie's part and Venom's part. I could understand this but to be honest, it's flat (4DX makes it better, since you cannot fall asleep). Anyway, some surprisings exist. The female Venom, conversations between Eddie and Venom...I have to say Tom performs very well.
PS: Are there really 4 symbiote in total? One escaped (Riot) , one died (with Dora), one Venom, and the yellow one? It just parasitized on the rabbit and... that's all?",Venom
3559,vincewolf-49735,Movie was amazing!!,10,5 October 2018,I see a lot of bad reviews about the movie and I think those people dont understand who Venom is or understand his backstory.

The guy has an alien entity inside of him so it's not a surprise he's going to be a bit unhinged in the process.",Venom

Sure it's not perfect and not of the ""Avengers"" quality but it has amazing action scenes and awesome special effects. When I was watching the trailer I couldn't understand what this film wanted to be but when you watch it you understand everything. The humor works and you understand the awkwardness of Venom and some of the lines he has. All the actors were great! Only issue I would have is the lack of technology. In a digital age you would think there would be more social media involved. But overall it works and couldn't be happier with the film.",Venom

Tom Hardy was excellent portraying Eddie Brock. Yes it was slow introduction, but it delivered once the movie started to pick up traction.

It seemed to have a bad rap only a day into its release which is totally unfair. In the first 20 mins I was concerned about it being cheesy but once Eddie and Venom sync up, the story line picks up and gets better every second. I loved it honestly and I think it's just as good if not better than some of the other recent marvel and dc movies. Tom hardy was amazing and did a great job! The movie was actually funny and I was shocked at how much I ended up liking and laughing at venom's character. The relationship between them was actually a little sweet but twisted.

3586,danial_shonen,Best story of the brutal beast whos calmed down by anti-hero.,8,6 October 2018,"Im from Malaysia and kinda surprised of earlier scenes which took place of Malaysia as part in film, although for short duration. <3About the movie, Sony has managed to make this film well, despsite it was not part and just association with MCU. Tom Hardy role the Venom character really well! He play the Eddie Brock really well, in every part in movie (I wasnt know Eddie much either as I has not read the comic or watch the animation. Pretty sure Eddie from Spiderman 3 is wasnt portraying original Eddie from comic as well).The CGI, sound anf other effects are good too, just Venom seems little slimmy. However as I love this movie very much it is alsobtoo early to judge either this movie really grest or not for overall, as lot of scenes has been cut to change the rating from R into PG13. Spoiler:
Due to this editor cut it is also accidentaly created some questions (at least for me?) which is:1) What happens to other 3 symbiotes as only Venom and Riot makes appearances through their host.2) Venom said ""goodbye"" to Eddie as he is trying to save Eddie before fully disfused with him and gone in fire. And yet somehow he is still with Eddie. Was wondering is it some leftover symbiotes inside Eddie like in the comic (turned into Anti Venom), or was the part was cut by the film?3) What happen to Alan, and what happens to Life Foundation as well?Hope Sony will release full movie (no cut) version through DVD.One thing for sure, Carnage is coming!",Venom

3601,evsspam,If you've ever read a Venom comic or seen a cartoon...,9,6 October 2018,".... then you won't be disappointed.
Hardy plays it very well, really likeable as Brock and the buddy-buddy commentary with Venom is excellent and he's done a really good job of voicing both.
The CGI for Venom itself really has borrowed a lot from the Darkness games/comics and to good effect, the dark beast is menacing and you believe it really does have some incredibly strength and power behind it.On to the actual story - well it is fairly straight forward and run of the mill but it works well and there's no clock checking boredom during action scene downtime that can happen with other superhero films. It's no Lawrence Olivier production but for a dark super hero film it paces itself well and the humour levels are the correct balance compared to the comics . It does suffer with a rather quick battle conclusion which feels a bit 'quick' compared to the rest of the film.Other than that only minor gripes are some CGI on Venom looks a little strange but no stranger than say Hulk growing/shrinking in Thor Ragnarok and that it would have been better with a little more gore BUT I appreciate this opens it up to a larger audience so I'm all for that.A great, great film and I thoroughly recommend it, one I'll be picking up digitally post release myself for a rewatch.",Venom
3602,vvkshow,Fantastic Movie !,9,6 October 2018,"First of all, do not compare this to any of other Marvel Films and also do not compare with the Spider-Man (Which showed Eddie Brock as a turned villian as he gains ego after losing his career because of Peter Parker). 
You may feel first half is boring or feeling lag but try to understand director's Perspective, that he is trying to show you how powerful Symbiotes are, how symbiotes transforms. 
Second half is just thrilling, no words to describe how symbiotes are dealing with every thing and just making Venom as a hero. ( Kindly watch and hear the interaction between Venom and Eddie, you will come to know what Venom really requires from Eddie so that they both have a deal and to continue from there.) 
Don't miss the post credits as that's the only scene where you may expect it's second part. If you have gone through the Old Comics, you might get a good idea, how far Venom goes and so there might be many perspectives for its series.Kindly watch from theatre and just feel the edge.
Thank youVickzey",Venom

The plot is fairly straightforward and simple, but there's nothing bad with it. 
The effects could be better, but they are good. 
The jokes are fun, the actors are good. 
If I wanted to make this movie better I'd like to add a little better special effects, remove all the annoying ""wink wink we have special eyes so you who watch will understand, even thought it's quite obvious, that we are bad guys"" effects (they do this in a LOT of movies, and it's equally annoying in all of them). I'd like to add a little more conversations between Venom and Eddie to get more of a feel of who Venom is and as an explanation to why he does what he does. But these are just nit picks. The movie was great, I had a good time. I'll buy it when it comes out. Don't listen to the critics. They clearly can't see a good movie when it's in front of them. :)",Venom

Now reading most reviews for this movie I was bummed out that the critics slammed this movie so badly. BUT, im here to tell don't believe the CRITICS, this movie was AWESOME X100. The CGI was steller and the visuals were amazing. The chemistry was excellent and really offered something. I was happy to see sony's imgination for VENOMS world was above average. The chemistry between venom and brock was just right. All I have left to say is WOW SONY YOU REALLY MADE A HELL OF A MOVIE!
VENOM LOOKS SO SICK!",Venom

3614,villarrealr-22906,Surprisingly Good! NOT BAD as Catwoman,7,7 October 2018,"Venom surprised me. It was a really good, fast paste, well-directed fun cheesy action movie! As for flaws, the tone is all over the place and the villan wasn't compelling. Tom Hardy was the best part. I was never bored. Not once was I thinking about Spider-Man, the movie didn't need him. Overall, Venom is NOT BAD, it's certainly not great but it was good! Wish it was rated R but they do go for a HARD PG-13 rating which I appreciated. It was certainly a fun time at the movies and wasn't a waste of time!",Venom

3617,shakyaanish-32004,Very entertaining movie!! Ignore the biased critics,9,7 October 2018,"Venom is a very entertaining movie to watch. Its what a venom origin must be like. The story develops very well in the first half which gives the premise for the origin of the venom. And the second half after venom entered Eddie Brock is so much fun to watch. The relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom is just so great. Tom Hardy's acting is awesome. The action scenes were a bit less. But overall I m very satisfied with the movie. Full entertainment. Lost respect for the critics who rate crap movies like Black Panther, Last Jedi and Deadpool higher and good movie like venom lower.",Venom

Do yourself a favor a go see it without expectation. A Simple origin story that set up a new universe to expand in the Sony comic universe. Tom hardy is superbad ass his performance is something that stand in the movie. Venom personality is amazing and something to explore. I don't mind the pg 13 we still have to wait for the extended cut that is the only thing I could notice is a fast movie but am sure there is a bunch of scene did t make it the final cut. We have to wait until the R version in blue ray,Venom
3623,revantshah,VENOM TASTIC,8,7 October 2018,"VENOM-a poisonous substance secreted by animals such as snakes,spiders,and scorpions and typically injected into prey by biting or stinging. The VENOM in this movie was an otherworldly parasite finding a suitable host and 'he' found one in Eddie Brock which is superbly played by Tom Hardy. The first half of the movie was a bit boring and quite gross but the second half was absolutely outstanding. VENOM is also voiced by Tom Hardy and he has done a phenomenal job. It is a movie worth watching and waiting( for the pre credits and the post credits scenes ).",Venom
3624,iltdlever,I believe in Vemon,10,7 October 2018,This film was fantastic. The role of Vemon was written for Tom Hardy. I hope we get a sequel. This film was great and it's all about personal preference not only because Rotten Tomatoes says it's bad. Don't believe it until you see it.,Venom

I've watched all the ""sins of the father's"" Spiderman cartoons and now as a dad 20 years or so later still had to go see it ignore. Rotten Tomatoes. If you can score a borefest like Gravity 10 then Venom should be 100! Plus my wife seemed to really enjoy it and didn't have high expectations to begin with with. Tom Hardy has great potential for a second film which I hope he does. I was not bored distracted or questioning anything during the film and was better by miles than I expected from some reviews which can only be a good thing.",Venom

How twisted is it that they still made the bad guy, not seem so bad after all. Movie was filled with action, little bit of scary or suspense and yet still hilarious! What a combo ! Still would have liked to see more evilness or scaryness, maybe sony should have gone for a R rating. Regardless it was fun and entertaining. Theater I went to, loved it as well, everyone clapped at the ending !! Waiting for Venom 2 now !",Venom
3638,thelastdeuce,See it for yourself! Make your own judgment.,8,7 October 2018,"As a Die Hard Venom fan, I really enjoyed the heck out of this film! Yes, it has some issues but they weren't enough to bring the movie down. I thought the cast was good especially Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom. Venom was the highlight of this film and stole the show for me. It was one of those moments where every time he appeared, I couldn't keep my eyes off of him and wanted to see more. He looks really good and I liked the chemistry between Eddie and Venom! The only thing missing is that iconic spider symbol on his chest...With all of that being said, the story feels a bit rushed. It's kind of obvious they cut out nearly 30-40 minutes of the film. And the final battle was very weak as well. I'm also wondering as to whether or not they should have gone for the R-rating. But, it is what it is and there's no changing that. Overall, I thought this was a solid start for the character and they proved that they didn't need Spider-Man to do it(though I wouldn't have argued against the idea of having him in it)But, there is a lot of potential here for future films and maybe one day we will have Spider-Man and Venom team up to go against Carnage!! That would be awesome!I think this film is worth seeing in theaters especially if you're a Venom/Spider-Man/comic book fan! I know that this is my opinion and everyone is entitled to have one, but I respectfully disagree with the majority of the critics who slammed this movie. Go see it for yourself and make your own judgement. Be sure to stay for the post-credit scenes! Hope you enjoy it.",Venom
3639,rachp-61197,Exciting! Must Watch!,10,7 October 2018,"The movie was awesome, action pack and a great plot and storyline.

The movie doesn't have a solid genre but that is waht makes it so good. It it so random in the good way. Tom brings the true meaning to antihero. And venom is just downright BADASS!! If you don't know about the Venom multiverse then give it some leeway. But this movie is a get on DVD movie for me definitely.,Venom

3647,frankg-64697,Just good fun.,8,8 October 2018,Venom was a lot of fun. Not the best Marvel movie I've seen but worth the price of admission. Corny at times and clever at times but just about all you can ask for in a film obviously targeted for younger kids.,Venom

It's slow to start out but then again this is an origin story so it should be expected. Tom Hardy is great, played the role very well. Comedy was good, pushed a little much but didn't go overboard. The action scenes are awesome and CGI was very good. If the PG-13 version was this good I can't wait to see the R rated version when it comes to Blu-Ray. 9/10",Venom
3651,castrillo-93905,Tom Hardy nailed it!,9,8 October 2018,"The purists will bash this movie because it diverges from the comic books' origin story and doesn't have Spiderman in it, but we finally have a great Spiderman movie franchise going, and I was relieved that this movie didn't try to be another cross-over. The story wasn't over complicated, but deep enough for good character motivation, and the action was big enough to be fun to watch without feeling like a bloated attempt to show off. And Hardy (as both Brock and Venom) was funny and engaging all the way through. I loved the movie, and can't wait for it to come out on video so I can add it to my collection!",Venom
3652,carsonmitton,No Spiderman Necessary.,9,8 October 2018,"As one who has read many comics of the Venom series I can say that this was not a conventional Venom. I mean that in a good way! The way Eddie Brock is portrayed in the movie is much more charming and likable, same goes for the venom symbiote. This movie is a great example of how the movie can change the narrative for the better. Yeah yeah I know that Spider-Man is an huge part of Venoms story in the comics, but he was not necessary in this adaptation. It was actually nice not having Venom attached to Spider-Man in the sense that he had his own identity and story. I have always loved Venom and the white spider logo on his chest along with the other abilities gained from Spider-Man, but this movie made him independent and capable. On screen Eddie Brock and Venoms relationship was perfect and would have only been further complicated by adding Venoms hate for Spider-Man and that relationship. Great intro for the character and who knows maybe later on they could bring Spider-Man into it and have him gain his abilities, regardless I honestly don't feel that it's needed.Massively underrated, don't listen to the critics low shots. Is it the best superhero movie ever...? Probably not, but it is was very enjoyable and Venom is awesome to watch. I think they made it spot on for the resources available at the time and what they did with the character.",Venom
3653,wrestlingwarrior,Amazing!,10,8 October 2018,This is by far the best we've ever seen venom on the big screen! It was just incredible seeing Eddie Brock and venom teaming up and being the great big black goop we all know and love! Can't wait for the sequel!,Venom
3654,sitarashahin,AMAZING !!,10,8 October 2018,"Do us all a favor and ignore all the bad reviews.

Seems to me like all the critics labeling Venom as a horrible movie, probably we're constipated or woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Maybe that's why they were so hard on it.

Why are there critics for entertainment? It is subjective. Huge comic book fan, huge spider man fan, and even bigger Venom fan, so this movie did a huge fan service just being made. Tom hardy was great, wish it had been rated R, but oh well. We can always hope the sequels are given the R. There was a little bit of slow pace in the beginning, but that's necessary for character development, as soon as Brock gets the symbiotic suite it goes up from there. Go see it, don't have expectations, enjoy the comedy and the action, and the awesome story of one of Spider-Man's most fiercest villains!",Venom

3669,thejuice-57644,Better than criticized,7,8 October 2018,Tom Hardy is perfect for this role and he rocks it! A lot of people are down on this movie but I enjoyed it. Venom is a stand alone character so this movie needed to differ from the storyline and feel of movies like Avengers and X-Men. Constant action and humor keep you in it. The only complaint I have is the language. This movie should've been rated R. I took my 2 boys thinking it was a typical Marvel PG-13 movie. It's not.,Venom

The possible negative side that I noticed is, if you expect it to be a horror movie where there is blood and Venom kills every person he sees, then you will be disappointed, it is a film aimed at the general public, not for fans, I think.",Venom

3672,tylerstaten-69203,Surprisingly Decent,6,9 October 2018,"I went to go see Venom, on opening night. I went in to this with low expectations given what I read from the critics and what I had seen in the trailers. I was pleasantly surprised, this movie is definitely not as bad as the critics are saying, but it is not great either. The movie overall was enjoyable, there was plenty of things I liked but also plenty of things I hated. The relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom was the best part of the movie, Tom hardy is an amazing actor and they nailed this aspect to perfection. The relationship between Eddie Brock and Anne Weying however, was not so great; it is like these two had absolutely zero chemistry which is believe is a fault of the script not the actors. There also really isn't really any incentive to care about any of the other characters except for Eddie and Venom, that is where all of the character development went. Riz Ahmed, though a great actor, was miscast as his role of Carlton Drake/Riot. The villain just wasn't interesting or believable. This movie also could have benefited from an R rating, but the action was definitely enough to please the hardcore fans. If you are not a stickler for the comic books and can see this movie for what it is, then you will surely enjoy it. Definitely some things that could be done better but overall not bad, I was not disappointed.",Venom
3673,tandinani,Venom is to die for,10,9 October 2018,"The movie was so good, im going to see it a second time. 
The portrayal of eddie brock and venom was spot on, even taking direct quotes from the comics. Even though (like Deadpool) he is an anti-hero he is so relatable and fun to watch. My new favorite marvel movie by far!",Venom
3674,lmikeharris,Don't Listen to Headlines,10,9 October 2018,"To start off, this movie was great. As a huge fan of Venom in the comics this was a great throwback to his hay day in the 90's. Venom is a deep, charismatic, quirky, off-kilter character that really deserved more than a cameo to explore why he is so beloved as a comic book anti-hero and this movie really pulled it off. Tom Hardy did a GREAT job playing all of the dynamic facets of Eddie Brock's character and this carries over into the symbiote himself. Venom is cruel, hungry, ruthless, and vulnerable, all at the same time. Many will assume that Venom is supposed to be a heartless villain bent on destruction but the reality is that he is a dynamic character that has many different motivations much like many of us. The action was great and the action was just as deserving. I would go see it again for the great performance by Tom Hardy and the accurate portrayal of the historic anti-hero.",Venom

But if you ignore that this film is really good. The acting is good,venom looks cool and their is some funny jokes.also the plot is good with some decent writing.  So I give this film an 8 out of 10.",Venom

3678,etonejaz,Never listen to critics when it comes to movies,9,9 October 2018,"I watched a lot of really bad movies that had really high reviews from professionals. The one thing I know for sure is that you like what you like. The movie can be perfectly shot, have cool cgi but still be boring as hell (most of DC titles, ahem).
Venom is a good movie because it has great acting, good jokes and it's entertaining to watch. I never once wanted to speed things up. The movie is FUN. The story is pretty simple because it's an origin story and we all know those, they're never too original (take ANY first Spider-Man movies except maybe Homecoming).
But Venom is still fun, entertaining and I don't feel like I wasted my time or money. Don't listen to the critics. Go enjoy a good movie.",Venom

Through all the wear and tear the genre has been through over the last decade, it's now been reduced to an empty, vapid and confusing mess of a product that Hollywood for some reason still insists on selling to us, and for some reason we still insist on buying from them.",Venom
3683,dburkeward,"Some decent CGI, that was accidentally released without a plot",4,9 October 2018,"Venom is finely crafted - crafted to avoid every possible interesting dialogue, and designed without audience members in mind. This feat appears to have been accomplished without a copy editor or, infact, an acomplished script writer. The tale was remarkable - it ignored the interesting directions the movie could have gone in, instead, including a faux 'evil' villain with kamikaze drones who's explosive powers seem to be inversely proportional with their proximity to Tom Hardy.The movie features a background of scientists who's moral code seems lacklustre at best, and at worst taken directly from the mantra of Mengele. This, surprisingly, goes wrong. Characters have a knack for receiving critical information just in time to prevent the 'plot' from derailing. This occurs so regularly, that if one doesn't pay attention, they might just beleive that all characters in the universe are somehow linked by mystical directing powers. They're not. The direction was awful.The CG was pretty good though. Worth a watch, but also worth sleeping through. You won't miss anything.",Venom
3684,tonypolony-54382,Critics don't know what there on about,9,9 October 2018,Critics can score this film low but it's there personal opinion and this is mine. I personally loved this film. I think being in a cinema with other fans made it work. Critics get a private screening just for them not sat in a big screen with other fans. The crowd made it for me. When there were funny bits even jumpy bits everyone in the cinema had the same reaction I feel venom was a really strong well acted piece of cinema and will defiantly go and see it again. Although I thought the start was dragged out a bit and the end was a little rushed I still thoroughly enjoyed the film.,Venom
3685,autumnlauterbach,Best marvel movie yet,10,9 October 2018,"This movie was really good! I didn't expect it to be so awesome, but it's honestly my favorite so far. Great movie, 10/10 would recommend. Although if you're thinking about bringing a younger kid since it's only PG-13, you may want to preview it first. No idea how it isn't rated R.",Venom
3686,robertorevilla,"Ignore the critics, Venom is a great ride",7,9 October 2018,"Glad I ignored the critics and went to see Venom. It was great and I can't wait to see what they do in the sequel. Sure the story line was pretty formulaic but Tom Hardy brought heart to both Eddie Brock and Venom, everyone in my showing came out saying they had a great time with both of them. Highly recommended.",Venom

3688,ravendeath-71583,Dumpster fire,1,9 October 2018,"The only redeemable thing I can say about this movie is They finally nailed Venom's look. as for the actual movie it was creditworthy at best normally I disagree with the critics but this time they where right. The pacing was terrible with most of the action scenes being not only already in the trailers but over before you can actually enjoy them.
The dialog was bland boring and downright embarrassing. The back and forth between Eddie and venom was like a neanderthal talking to a 10 year old.
While other marvel movies have propelled the genera forward this took it back to the early 2000's. Then theirs the villain, who was one of the least intimidating villains I have ever seen with so little screen time you don't get to even care about him as a character or his motivations. 
I absolutely wouldn't recommend this snootiness of a movie unless you have insomnia personally I hated this movie but and if this is the future of the Sony's Venom verse then it's already doomed.",Venom
3689,freedom-84225,I don't know why people are rating this so high.,3,10 October 2018,"The good:
Tom Hardy
Woody Harrison indroduced as Carnage
Venom looked not bad.The bad:
Not one reference to Spider-man. The Venom character came from Spider-man and evolved into one of his greatest enemy's. Venom is one of those characters where you need the actual back story involving Spider-man due do his obsession with him. Sony is now trying to catch up to the MCU and ruin decent characters just because they have film rights.Sony can fix it by Calling the next movie Maximum Carnage. Have Spider-Man with out changing the story as much as they did and FIX IT.Its worse then:
Green Lantern
X-men Orgins: Wolverine ( At least they still said he was Canadian)
Spider-man 3 ( At least they show hatred with Parker)
Ben Affleck's Daredevil
ElektraSony should take a step back from their Sony Universe of Marvel Characters. Hire people that know the Chatacters stories instead of changing oringinal stories and appreciates the comic genre.Form a better partnership with the MCU where sony will still maintain distribution rights or something along those lines. Sony is going to butcher Spider-man.",Venom

If you liked the trailer, go watch it in the cinemas.",10,10 October 2018,"Because of the critic reviews I was a bit hesitant about the quality of this movie, so it really surprised me in the theatres on HOW GOOD IT WAS. This is definitely the Venom movie I wanted and expected from the trailer and I'm very glad I saw it at the cinemas.
I'm a hardcore action movie fan and although this movie is full of CGI, I mean he is a tar looking alien ""parasite"" (sorry venom), I did enjoy the brutalness of the group fights.
 However, this may be a weird statement but I would've preferred the movie to be R rated, for more brutal action scenes and darker humour but that doesn't stop me from loving this movie. 
P.S: I would probably advise those who like a little more thrill to watch it in 3D.",Venom

3697,londonismybackyard,Venom is amazing!,8,10 October 2018,"If I said it once, I said it a zillion times: Venom deserved better from the movie critics. Seriously, it's not nearly as bad as the critics made it seem. The movie is fun, entertaining and different from the past superhero movies. It has a lightness to it - almost like an early 2000s superheroe movie. I'm stil disappointed it was rated pg13, but you know what? It makes sense. 
The movie does have its flaws, like a weak and simplistic plot and slow-paced scenes, but quite honestly I couldn't care less. I was so into the whole Eddie/Venom saga that it just didn't matter. Tom Hardy did a great job and delivered some really good and funny scenes - intentionally or not. 
Maybe we all feel like every movie should follow Infinity War's steps now, and therefore become more serious? I don't know. But I was not demanding that from Venom and had a great time. And not for one minute I caught myself thinking ""I wish Spider-Man was in it"". It was all about Venom to me. Again, this movie is not your usual perfect superhero film - but it's way far from being horrible. Give Venom a chance!",Venom
3698,eollynart,I reeeeeaaally loved it!,10,10 October 2018,"When I went to the movies I was a bit skeptical. I thought that this movie would disappoint me because the trailers look way too cool and I am just used to trailers showing off only the good parts and then when the movie comes it would be hella boring. Well, I'm glad to say this was not the case with the ''Venom'' movie at all. I was with my eyes wide open the whole time. I loved the acting and the chemistry between Venom and Eddie. The build up was done nicely and It had some really funny moments which just makes me love the characters even more. Great watch from the start to the end and I highly recommend it.",Venom

It was a ton of fun and Tom Hardy was amazing. It doesn't have any of the bland checkboxes that MCU films have. Marvel is great, but it gets a little predictable in movie style. Venoms plot was not the best and the writing wasn't great either, but none of that mattered once Hardy came into contact with the symbiote. I would love to see this Venom take on the MCU. Or at least spiderman in a Maximum Carnage arc. Anyways, go see it, it was as good as 50% of MCU films.",Venom

Does it have pacing problems? Yes. Is it's comedy inconsistent? Yes. Is it's villain weak and underdeveloped? Yes. Most importantly though, is it fun? Abso-freakin-lutely",Venom
3707,nicholasmcfadden,Finally a superhero movie as it should be,9,11 October 2018,Refreshing comic book feeling movie from Marvel. Venom was the first good Marvel feeling superhero movie since Iron Man 1 and Thor. it didn't take itself too seriously the whole time and wasn't trying to make up for it with random dumb jokes. It had an overlying seriousness and consistent funny quirkiness throughout as Marvel should be.,Venom
3708,jdpplessis,Watchable,7,11 October 2018,Tom Hardy was a great fit for the movie. The humor between venom and Eddie was super funny. The downside for me was the ending seemed rushed and the introduction to venom was really stretched and not really exciting,Venom

However, once we saw it, I knew that it was worth it.Tom Hardy plays a very awesome and funny Eddie Brock, and his combo shenanigans and seriousness throughout the movie really appealed to me, and the action and fight scenes were incredibly well choreographed and done. The storyline made sense, and the kept the characterization of Venom as an antihero (like he was in his titular 1990s comic series), which was very good. :)",Venom
3719,carlasantd,Venom is not your usual superhero movie. And that's a good thing!,9,12 October 2018,"Honestly, the critics don't do Venom justice. The movie is funny, but not Marvel-like funny. Don't expect them to crack a joke every five minutes - not gonna happen. And as a die-hard Marvel fan, I say it as a compliment. Venom is refreshing exactly because it doesn't try to force what other superhero movies have been feeding us. It doesn't try to be what is not. It lies between serious and funny, but it doesn't exaggerate either. It does feel like it came straight out of the early 2000s, and again, it's not a bad thing. 
People comparing this movie with Marvel and DC current movies forgot they had years and years to prepare themselves to get where they are now. Marvel alone took 10 years! So being hard on Venom for it it's just plain silly. 
Tom Hardy gives an amazing performance as both Eddie and Venom. And seeing the main characters' chemestry develop on screen is utterly amusing. 
Of course not everything is great. I think Michelle Williams should have been given more screen time being the talented actress she is. Also the plot was way too simple and at some point we didn't have a clue where the film was going. Some events felt rushed while others felt slow. 
Still, I must say I had a really nice time watching it. I've watched it twice already and it's funny because the first time I saw it, I gave it an 8. But now that I watched a second time, it's a solid 9 for me. 
Venom doesn't deserve the bad treatment and low scores it's receiving. It's a fun ride and you need to appreciate the movie for what it is.",Venom

3723,WeirdPaint,Venom is an enjoyable film with a few downsides,7,13 October 2018,"Venom is a film with great acting and a good story. While it starts off slow at first, it quickly cranks up the action when Venom latches on to Eddie. Tom Hardy did a great job with the role of Eddie Brock as he brings the right amount of emotion throughout the film. The story is alright, though it does have its problems. A subplot with the Riot symbiote tends to drag on and gets confusing at some points. Another problem with the film is the action. While the action was great, I really felt like it didn't truly showed how Venom acts and I really think the film should of gotten an R rating. In the end, Venom is an very enjoyable and satisfying movie even with its few flaws. I would highly recommend this movie to people who are fans of the anti-hero or are just fans of superheroes in general. Also, if you do go see the movie, make sure you sit through the end credits if you want see a very satisfying mid credit scene ;)",Venom

Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock is great and the on-screen relationship he has with Venom is tremendous. I saw one critic that said that this film was not as fun as Thor: Ragnarok.

It gave me chills to watch the realistic battle, that sadly... Only lasts for a moment, and in the end you wish that the movie could never stop, and go on forever, it was sad for me to walk out in the theatre, sad it was over, but COMPLETELY inspired, to be different, and pursue my dreams as a Hollywood actress. My name is Julia, and I have BIG dreams. We often wish we could become someone whoms different, and who can change the world for the better.

3732,bretthohenwarter,"A movie for people who love Venom, not people who hate movies.",10,14 October 2018,"It took me a long while to put into words exactly who the audience for this movie is. It's not for kids, because it's just a little too dark, and it's definitely not for the 30+ movie-goer who's never heard of Venom before (but LOVES other Marvel movies). This movie is for fans of Venom who voted with their wallets, and definitely not the people who ""decide"" how well a movie deserves to do at free showings.That said, the movie brings a lot of elements to the table that leave you either leave you chuckling or pumping your fist in excitement. Hardy's delivery of Eddie is /supposed/ to be tacky, because Eddie isn't your normal, bad-ass super ""hero"" like in other Marvel movies. He's a reporter who's been infected by an other-worldly goo monster, and reacts how many people would: with fear of course, but also amazement, from somebody who can't believe what's going on. Venom's quips are on key, the ways he interjects into Eddie's life are pitch perfect to the comics, and they're also perfectly portrayed as the badass creature that Venom is when the fists (and goo) start flying. The plot doesn't try too hard because that's not what fans need. There are enough deep, amazing arcs in the comics for Venom to be explored; we just wanted to see Venom rip it up in his usual style, and this movie delivers. Little vignettes that show fans that the makers of this film know their subject material very, very well, and want us to feel good for knowing it, too. I don't want to spoil anything, but I can guarantee that fans of the character are going to have a blast with this movie.The problem with everything I said there is very obvious. If you're a movie critic, odds are your entire life (I mean, it has to be?) is centred around watching film after film, with no room for fandoms or other time-demanding hobbies like comics. You don't have time to invest in something as deep as Venom. He's an admittedly B-rate villain with his own convoluted arcs and lore, which is obviously less accessible than someone mainstream like Spider-Man or The Avengers, but one with his own charm that can't be found elsewhere. All critics have time for is watching a movie when it comes out, writing notes as it plays and missing the point of certain deliveries entirely. They are paid to hate movies, picking out every little irrelevant detail because they aren't even watching the movie for themeslves; they're watching it for money. It sounds conceited to say, but critics just aren't in the loop with this one, and it's not fair to the movie itself.Critics seemed to expect the usual easy-to-digest Marvel $300million suck-fest, with very clear goodguy/badguy roles, designed to rake in as many non-comic-nerd people as possible with shallow story telling, huge action sequences, and set pieces to make the kids freak out about the new merchandise at WalMart.Venom is not for those people. People have been wanting/trying to make a Venom movie since 1997, and fans (fan is putting it lightly) of the character like myself have been waiting so patiently for our chance to see the Lethal Protector in screen. My score? 10/10. The risk payed off, and I know many fans who have gone back for third or fourth viewings. The producers knew exactly who was going to see a film about Venom, so they made this for them as an apology for taking so long. The sequel villain reveal in the credit sequences? A beautiful mixture of ""no they didn't actually"", ""oh man that's so perfect!"" and ""what is even happening?!!"" burst out in the theatre, which tied up the whole movie with a beautiful ribbon. Similarly to how Neill Blomkamp made Chappie as an apology to fans for the absolute train wreck that was Elysium (spoiler alert, critics liked it but Neill fans didn't), Venom was made for people who love Venom, not people who hate movies as a job. Go see it if you can suspend your disbelief for a moment and really sink your teeth into something designed to make you laugh, but have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.",Venom

I walked into the movie theatre thinking, there were 30% reviews, I didn't hear anything about the movie, honestly forgot I was gonna see it that day
and for some context, some RT (rotten tomatoes) reviews said, ""it should be R-rated"" or ""is this a comedy?""
back to those in a second
from the opening few minutes, I was like well here we go the cliche dark music to start, rushed through the opening sequence, non-impressive special effects, I even pulled my phone out 5 minutes in to check the running time which was 2 hours 20 minutes, at which point I mouthed ""damn iT""
so clearly I couldn't be more biased from the RT reviews I read a few minutes ago
as I start to watch, the comment about the movie that it should've been R-rated started to sound more and more true: ""damn imagine if venom destroying those ppl in the beginning were R-rated. wow this movie has such a lack of focus. what kind of audience are they trying to reel in, <=13yo? would've done wayyyyy better with R-rated elements.
I'm hating on this movie so hard. 
now let's skip to when Venom comes in. we're at the part where Eddy (main character) has become a host for the Venom (aka he's infected-ish). the part when he gets infected is kinda cliche which just made me even more angry, but I was somewhat excited to see how Venom plays out in Eddy's body.
A few minutes later he goes home and Eddy, looking at a mirror, suddenly shouts the word ""FOOD"" and scares himself into passing out. Eddy himself did not say this, but it was Venom, which lies in his body. I was like what the f, cuz his voice was in perfect adult English, complete with personality, and still monster-like.
Anyways Eddy and Venom end up having a relationship with each other. It starts off just animalistic from Venom's side as it tries to survive and stuff. But as the movie progresses, their conversations start to reflect that of a of friendship laced with banter, but tied by the need for both of them to survive (if Eddy dies, Venom dies).
Their interactions (especially with an English speaking Venom inside Eddy) start to become funnier and sometimes stupid. I laughed in the movie sometimes because scenes and dialogue were downright stupid, and sometimes because Venom is a real charm.
Anyways by the end I was genuinely sad that our time with Eddy and Venom was coming to a close and I was shocked that 2 hours and 20 minutes flew by so quickly.
comment on those RT reviews: I do agree there should be an R-rated version and it would be amazing, but this is just such a treat that I appreciated not passing up on. Also is this a comedy? I would say yes. Because I've learned one thing from watching movies. You enjoy a movie not because it's perfect (though it definitely could be), you enjoy it if you love at least *one* aspect of it. For Venom, everything was arguably trash, EXCEPT for Venom and Eddy.something I kept saying to myself in the middle was ""Venom is a *really* good Youtube-style movie"". like you know how there are some long movies that ppl upload on youtube. the quality and laughability of this movie reminds of something I'd see on youtube but is like 10-star at that level nomsayin. WATCH THIS please",Venom

The plot was pretty common just as other superhero movie but think about what the producers thought about a new movie of an anti-hero, they got to start somewhere and try to make it fun and cool. Don't listen the critics just see it and say what do you think also if everyone have a different opinion.

3741,avlwwriting,Critics Be Damned,8,15 October 2018,"The way I see it, is that Venom is a wonderful movie. It was NOT made with the intent to impress critics. Honestly, Critics can all go to hell for all I care. What do they give except biased, one sided sissy reviews, written especially articulate to make themselves feel good. Anyway, Venom was a FUN movie. The action was top notch, and not once did I lose interest in any of the film. What people and critics don't understand is that not all movies are critically appealing, because critics have such a narrow quota. My point is, Venom was a great, fun, and very entertaining movie, and that's all a movie has to be, in my opinion.",Venom
3742,explorergirl-95144,One star deducted because big Pharma is not allowed in san Fransisco and Hollywood should know this,9,15 October 2018,"Alright, listen up. I never review movies. I do not do this, I do not see a point to this, and I do not think the effort is worth it. That being said, this movie has been done so dirty by movie critics that it is my patriotic duty as a gay person from the San Fran area to defend it. 
The primary problem with this movie is that it leads you to believe it's an action movie. It's not, that's a lie, accept it. Venom is not the big dumb action movie we deserved, it is the big dumb gay romcom that we needed. It is yet another blessing of 20gayteen. Tom Hardy's acting is stellar as usual. Some of the other actors are a bit too concerned about the events of the movie to fully channel San Fran but that's alright. Venom was always going to be a difficult character to translate to the big screen, but overall they did a pretty bang-up job. 
Also, any movie critics who say that Venom is ""in desperate need of a stronger attachment to Spider-Man"" need to read the actual comics because Eddie and the symbiote are married. They have a kid. Fake nerd boys are always getting everything wrong. 
I would also like to add that the CGI in this movie was incredible. Serious kudos. How long did that take?
TL;DR Venom was gay- I mean great- and fabulous, movie critics need to shut up and actually judge movies on the proper criteria, and the most unrealistic part of this was that people in San Fransisco would allow big pharma to move in and sign up for clinical trials. 
Source to prove I'm right: I'm gay and from San Fransisco.",Venom

3745,everydeal,Its just a an average comedy,4,16 October 2018,"Its plot is generic.
Every time an action scene begins I want it to end just cause how boring and repetitive it is.
Characters are pretty mediocre, love interest is boring and unnecessary.
Villain is basic and has been done better on many other movies.
Motive of the villain and hero is very typical.
Only good parts we're some of the banter between Hardy and Venom, a lot of the jokes come off as cringe-inducing, and some of Hardy's acting.
Use of actors like Riz Ahmed were underutilized.
Soundtrack is average but somewhat helped the movie during suspenseful moments.
Very tame violence, you might not even notice someone dying throughout the movie.Overall, unimpressive and quite predictable. Could have been done much more better. I don't want to call it a flop or a bad movie, but it just didn't try hard enough to be a good film.",Venom

The story had potential but they just didn't do anything with it. And I don't think there was a single likeable character, except MAYBE Dr. Dan.

The beginning of the film felt very off and was pretty boring for the most part until Eddie bonds with venom which is undeniably the best part of the film which it should be. Tom hardy chemistry with the symbiotic is amazing and feels very natural. Getting into spoilers now I don't really understand why the film wasn't given the R rating, it feels very wierd watching venom kill tons of people eating some of there heads but there no blood at all, gore isn't needed in a movie but should be in that context. It didn't really make too much sense why venom decided that he liked earth and wanted to save it, just would've been better if they explained it more than just him climbing on top of a building and seeing that the world is actually pretty. All around Venom did a pretty great job at portraying the comic book villain but still had a lot of plot holes that were very hard to ignore, it's not the worst marvel film but doesn't nearly stand up to How the mcu started with iron man. Sony's universe of marvel characters will be interesting to say the least but don't have high hopes for it after seeing this film",Venom

3760,lunaphin-27451,A flawed but fun movie,6,24 October 2018,I'll start with the good aspects of Venom. Venom is a fun movie with an excellent performance by Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and Venom. The chemistry between Eddie and Venom is the most interesting aspect of the entire movie. The banter between the two of them leads to some of the most fun and entertaining moments in the film. The action scenes were well choreographed especially the first appearance of Venom in the apartment fight scene. The bad aspects of filmmaking are slightly more prevalent but don't derail the entire film and take away the entertainment of the film like what happened in Batman vs Superman. The connection between Anne played by Michelle Williams and Eddie Brock felt lukewarm and awkward at best. Carlton Drake played by Riz Ahmed seemed a little cartoonish at times and overzealous in his approach. He seemed a little like a wannabe Thanos who has less character development and depth. The biggest gripe I had would be the PG-13 rating. Venom is an incredibly violent character and a PG-13 rating didn't give justice to the character of Venom like an R rating would. Surprisingly I didn't have too much of a problem with the absence of Spider Man though the origin seemed a little bit wonky. All in all I feel like my time wasn't wasted and I had a really good time watching this movie that's so mediocre it's fun. The humor did fall flat a few times but I could see past that and just enjoy what I had. I highly recommend the movie those who don't really know Venom and I do recommend the movie to Venom fanatics although these fanatics might have a few problems.,Venom

3763,daveandsonya-25347,"Lot of fun, critics too harsh.",7,22 October 2018,"Reading the critics before going (I'm slowly learning this is not a good idea) I was nervous about this film. But it was a lot of fun and better than I expected it would be. The first half hour was a bit slow and the final battle scene was not great as it was hard to follow and very CGI heavy.
But Tom Hardy was great. His relationship with the Venom symbiote was both funny and had tense moments. The supporting acting was good and some of the set ups for the humour were excellent.
Hopefully there will be more movies to come with Venom and he's a character that I'd love to see in a movie with Deadpool.
Comic fans especially should enjoy the post film credits.",Venom
3764,vivivieirasilva,Yeah it's not that bad,8,25 October 2018,"Venom is an okay movie. It doesn't really have any serious problems, especially if you consider that the studio had to it without Spider-Man. Of course, some things had to be changed. For instance, Venom is kinda dumb and also a bit heroic. Riot is the main villain, but it (he? I don't know, it's a symbio) lacks character development. But the relationship between Eddie Brock and his Symbio is pretty fun to watch. By the way, Tom Hardy delivers an acceptable Eddie, considerang many aspects os his personality were changed because he's supposed to be the hero here, the good guy. Overall it's a fun, decent movie, and it is worth watching.",Venom

3767,lcosbornau,"Why they chose THAT direction to go in for Venom, I'll never know ($$$$$$$)",2,27 October 2018,"If I was to ever be called a nerd for anything in my life, it would be for my admiration for the character Venom. So when I heard that non other than the awsome Tom Hardy would be portraying him on the big screen, I could barely contain my nerdgasm's. However, when I heard they were giving Venom a PG-13 rating I died a little bit inside. Venom (like The Punisher) is the darker side of Marvel, and they should have kept it as such. Instead, they went for this black comedy mess that just went too far to the point of being silly (yes, they actually made Venom silly). Don't get me wrong, I laughed & the conversations Eddie has with Venom when other people are around is amusing. But its not Venom...they sacrificed the characters integrity to give it a PG-13 rating so that kids could also go see it so they could make more cash. So typical of Hollywood today, all about the cash grabbing and less about artistic integrity. One of the things that made me laugh the hardest in the movie was the total lack of blood, even when people are eviscerated there's nothing. It just goes to show how dumb a lot of film makers think their audiences are, that we'll just overlook minor but critical details like that. There was only about 4 - 6 seconds in one scene where it felt like Venom, but other than that all I really enjoyed about the film was the action scenes, and even they weren't fantastic.
Venom deserved better, oh so much better. And all these reviews praising the comedy aspect in the film just makes me feel ill",Venom
3768,samirgoel,Absolutely Awesome Movie!!,9,28 October 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie beginning to end and say that Sony and all the creative team/talent nailed the characterization and the movie. Tom, Michelle, Riz, Jenny and all the acting talent were flawless in bringing this amazing movie to life! The only thing that I actually agree with is that the 6 month time frame was unfortunately sloppy and shouldn't have left that hole. This could have been easily done by not putting in 6 months later and nobody would have known but other than that this movie was solid and truly enjoyable. I am absolutely looking forward to seeing Venom vs Carnage.Oh, and in terms of people hating on both Michelle and Woody's wigs I actually love them! I The wig on Woody makes him look more like Kassidy than if he didn't have it. I didn't think it looked cheesy at all. I kind of saw it in the trailers and wanted to see it in the movie and I was like right on!!! But I suppose everyone has their likes and dislikes.I would love to see this movie eat through $700 million plus as it is absolutely deserving of a solid world wide earnings! V for Venom and Victory!!! Well done Sony, looking forward to seeing Venom 2 and Morbius--I love my Spidey characters and this movie just goes to prove that the webhead didn't have to be involved to make a phenomenal movie but with this being said no doubt I would love to see Spidey and Venom cross paths for sure!!",Venom

3771,steeltoediesel,How canonical Venom material could make this movie (and potential sequels!) better,9,1 November 2018,"I don't normally go out to see movies, or watch movies much at all, but I did enjoy Venom. I was drawn to the unconventional monster/antihero main character, and stayed for the awesome symbiotic relationship and banter between Eddie and Venom.
After watching the movie, I read through the Venom comic series and I have some suggestions/opinions.First of all, it's about time to kill off the obligatory generic heterosexual relationships. They're overplayed, over used, and in most cases have little or nothing to do with the plot. Not to mention, Eddie Brock doesn't display much interest in pursuing relationships in all the recent Venom material.
Why? Because his relationship with his symbiote consumes him, to the point of obsession - and it's not one-sided. The bond between Eddie and Venom is profound, to the point where neither of them feel complete without the other, and if they are separated, they would tear the world apart to be together again.That's an element I would love to see more of, something that I hope would be developed more if there's plans for future films. Canonically, Eddie uses terms of endearment when addressing Venom, such as ""love"", and ""dear"". Venom refers to their bond as being ""just like marriage"". Eddie has been referred to as the secondary father to Venom's asexually produced offspring. When separated, they've found each other sheerly by following the feeling of their connection.
The symbiote and Eddie have this insane, passionate, co-dependent, borderline unhealthy relationship and obsession with each other, and that's what I, and many others would like to see more of.
So ditch generic female #7 and relationship trope #13. The generations watching Venom are young and aren't bothered by a little queerness. It's a big reason why Deadpool had such a huge draw - many people were attracted to the fact that the protagonist is canonically pansexual (something that the movies didn't really deliver on, but ah well).Second suggestion: the CGI was a little overcooked. The fight scene at the end between the two symbiotes was difficult to follow. Sometimes less is more.Third: give it an R rating. Venom has never been a ""tame"" character. You're not portraying some do-good vigilante superhero that gently binds up criminals before hand delivering them to jail - we're talking about a borderline psychotic, homicidal, cannibalistic entity. Canonically, his savagery in the pursuit of what he believes is justice puts him on almost everybody's bad side, heroes and villains alike. His fighting style is that of an executioner with a dull axe; brutal, vicious, and unethical. Give us the gore, man.That's about all I have to say. Tom Hardy nailed the role of Eddie. I don't know what the movie would have been without him, but I'm thinking it wouldn't even be half as good.
Also, the critics all have something wedged where the sun doesn't shine. I have no idea how the movie warranted such a negative professional reception, but I genuinely enjoyed it.",Venom
3772,amarendra-99877,TOM HARDY IS BORN TO PLAY EDDIE BROCK,10,29 October 2018,"Do not believe the so called critics who are so much busy bashing this movie.Its actually a really good movie with a simple storyline with a some titbits inspired from the 90s and that's actually a good thing and well guess what venom was born in the 90s.IMO Tom hardy did a spectacular job helming this iconic anti-hero with a perfect balance between his role as Eddie Brock and venom.Loved the cute chemistry between Hardy and Williams aka Annie.She has also given a praise worthy performance.This version of venom is way better than the Sam raimi's spider man3 where topher grace's venom had barely an impact...My only grouse is the cancellation of a R rated version...that would be cool and badass.Visual effects and CGI uses are perfectly balanced unlike the glittery justice league and GOG2.
In the end I would like to say that Tom hardy is now in the league of RDJ, Hugh jackman,Johnny depp because he has truly given justice to this icon and I would love to see another venom flick because of Hardy.",Venom
3773,lauruschel,What i think about this movie.,6,30 October 2018,"Yesterday I watched Venom, created by Ruben Fleisher, it is a good film like, and it is about super heroes eating heads and destroying the whole city to save just one person. The principal problem that I have found is the duration of the start - until h get the ""super powers"", it is so long and it does not need that time to explain the world, friendship and things about the personal character life.
When the action starts and you think ""Now I am enjoying it, I want the continue"" the film just finishes, in the middle of the fight, giving a impression that the money has ended.
And the post credit scene - how do I freaking hate Marvel when they put this; you stay there like an idiot watching letters, come on... I know that it is a good thing for the creators but needed that much time?
Although, there is not just negative things, in some aspects the film is cool, Venom have a good personality but the character have no much special effects - and they are not that good, like, sometimes you cry blood watching it -. I liked the fight and that is it, hope you enjoy the best review of the world.",Venom

The characters of Eddie Brock and Venom(played by Tom Hardy) have amazed me and are far better than the ""Venom"" & ""Eddie Brock"" in Spiderman 3. Not only that but it potrays great relationship between the former Journalist and Alien Symbiote. Despite Spiderman not being involved in their origin like every other interation of the characters, they surely be one of my favourite Eddie and Venom even in comparison with the older cartoons or comics.The story was fun and it was thrilling at times and also had some great comic moments. There were times where I was either on the edge of my seat or struggling not to burst out laughing while in the theatre.Overall this was a fun film to watch and surely it isn't perfect. Some scenes could have been better but other than that I'd say the whole movie was just amazing.

3788,caseybrewer-44995,Not enough symbiotes?,7,27 November 2018,When it comes to this film by itself it's really good like if venom was never a marvel property and this was a movie on its own I would have given it a higher score. My reason being that I think that the symbiote's could have been a bigger villain as this movie is mainly based off the venom lethal protector comic series and in that many symbiotes were the villain (along with riot). Because the next film is most likely going to be a carnage vs venom movie I don't expect the other symbiotes to be featured.Tom Hardy was really good as he played the character of Eddie Brock poorly which is good because if you were to be taken over by something like venom wouldn't you be paranoid and terrified like Eddie. In the comics Eddie is more of a badass who is very much brainwashed by venom but in this movie he is fighting it or at least when it comes to eating people. This movie I think explained the backstory of the Klentar or the symbiotes very well cause I think that not many people are really familiar with this characters backstory it would have gotten a higher score if it weren't for the lack of multiple symbiote characters.,Venom
3789,lancemidhun,"Tom Hardy , you had to be.......",7,28 November 2018,"A bit more of a tough dude , because eddie brock was a tough guy in the marvel universe. And Venom did an amazing work, he was in Character all the time. I blame Tom Hardy cuz he needed a good director who had to get the help of the late Mr. Stan lee peace upon him. Venom was a viral character , so was eddie brock. He was real tough and not a p***y , (said like in the movie).
The name itself give life to a tough person (Eddie brock). So please do be in comic character which is a real good eye opener for you guys at work on the sequel or a fusion for Marvel Villians.",Venom

3792,aramisramos,Venom!,10,30 November 2018,"You may be wondering if the movie is worth even your precious time. Well it is! From comedy scenes, to action, to some crazy special effects, this movie has a little bit of everything and is definitely worth seeing in the theater if you can! The movie is about a alien species landing on Earth, they are called symbiotes. Most need a to connect to a host to survive, so what ends up happening (Avoiding Spoilers). One of the symbiotes ends up connecting with the main character Eddie Brock who happens to be reporter.
He ends up finding out about a man (Avoiding spoilers). Who runs illegal experiments on people for the sake of ""Science"". Eddie tries to take him down with the press but it ends up backfiring on him, which makes him lose everything. So with the symbiotes help he plans to take down the man and destroy the experiments he has been working on. Or so he hopes.
The special effects were phenomenal, there were a lot of action scenes that just wowed you or left you looking all around the screen to try to absorb every thing thrown at you at once. Although that may seem overwhelming at first it honestly doesn't. It's made by one of the most brilliant companies named Marvel, who is known for making some of the most spectacular super hero movies of all time. The acting also is played by good actors so nothing really seems corny or cheesy. The main character is played by legendary actor Tom Hardy who is known for many of his parts in movies such as, The Revenant, Dunkirk, and many more. Overall the movie is spectacular and is worth seeing if you haven't seen it already!",Venom
3793,robertsaun-27862,"A combination of lame writing, stupid and cliché CGI and equally horrible plot",2,30 November 2018,"This movie clearly intended for day time TV soap opera fan because it's filled with obnoxious and wrongly placed music, overly used dialogue, lame writing, weak character development, lame and unnecessary sex scene and CGI that only show off how fake everything is.

I was very worried when I heard that the rating was sitting at a PG13, and that like many movies before it, would be stripped and clipped of any sort of blood or violence but what i'm pleased to say is that this movie is an exception not the standard.",Venom

1. Great performance by Tom Hardy especially as Venom
2. The movie never fails to have fun with its characters

4 . Right movie length

3800,brenorianrian,Sincerely disrespect comments below and read,5,4 December 2018,"I watched the film with a hope that the director scaled to make the film, already with an extensive package of 'violent' productions made without problems and without care but here in venom it was all more sanitized nor what it should be ' 'aggressive' 'as head start works here because it uses a lot of angle change or it increases the hype of the cameras leaving the movie more agitated without seeing the graphic violence that befits the character itself. Taking out the action peaks of Tom that seemed more like DiCaprio exalting or Nicolas Cage changing personality from one hour to another being that until the encounter with the symbiote he acted like a drunk, already the symbiote has been scaled as a comic strip for scenes was one of the worst mistakes, is not to make the Venom something important to the public even being the main of the film since the empathy is low and the aggressiveness extensive? But Venom was a good movie.",Venom
3801,nikhildmahadeva,The reason this movie is brilliant is the reason purists and critics don't like it,10,4 December 2018,"People bemoan the abscence of Spiderman, the abscence of Venoms core personality traits - his obsession with Spiderman as a host, and his uncontrollable bloodlust from the influence of his previous hosts. The movie isn't sticking to the story of Venom as found in the comics.Now, I love the comics. I really do. But frankly, these traits were also the most dull part of Venom - every story, he gets better, fights the bloodlust (or gets reset), reaches some kind of balance, and then bam. He's an obsessive, homicidal maniac again. It's a tired cycle. This movie on the other hand, is a refreshing, dark humor approach to the beloved Kyntar that frankly fits perfectly into the marvel universe as it is now.Tom Hardy's portrayal of Eddie Brock, the imperfect person that he is, and Venom actually showing the productive relationship that his race is technically intended to have is the perfect setting for an antihero of this kind, and frankly, the kind of anti hero that should be in the MCU (Too bad this is a separate universe). Comics get retconned all the time. Consider this a retcon that makes Venom a stronger standalone character, rather than having to lean on Spiderman all the time for his pathos.",Venom
3802,shinnwai,Forget the critics,10,5 December 2018,I was never a Spiderman fan and venom could not impress me before. But this movie made me a hard core fan of venom.

3812,ClariceStarbuck,A Beautiful Not-So-Disaster of A Movie,8,15 December 2018,"Just saw this film with my friends a while back and lemme say...... It was good. I can see why critics would dislike it AND why viewers love it, honestly.Even though this isn't technically in the MCU, I'm surprised they let Miss Anne Tifa visit on set like WOWWW. Eddie's journalist montage edited over BLM and pride riots, the diverse San Franciscan backdrop, the villian being a thinly veliled metaphor for millionaires like Elon Musk who waste their money on space explorations when it could be used for combatting climate change or cancer research, homeless people being taken advantage of for these experiments.... the list goes on. And I know I know that's just hypocritical woke points coming from a company like Sony, but having messages about undesirable people overcoming evil associated with a chaotic, gruesome space monster kicking doing the same feels so right. It feels like they nailed the antihero story well.
The action scenes had good and bad to them, as the black-on-blackness makes it really hard to see whats going on sometimes, but the escape from the government guys and music is pumped w/ adrenaline.Eddie, Hardy's character, is the best one in the film. I'm pretty much done with the whole ""loveable-loser-trying-to-get-back-with-his-stern-but-beautiful-successful-girlfriend-but-its-righteous-because-hes-relatable-we-swear"" trope, and despite it taking up one of the biggest chunks in the movie, more than Venom himself, feels rushed. The only thing that actually works is that Eddie actually is a decent guy that goes out of his way to help people. The whole fact they're together feels completely stupid, considering she dumped him because he didn't want to be dishonest to his viewers and was fired for it. It feels even worse because it was established they were living together and acting all lovey-dovey a scene before. The rest of the film he mopes over her, is forced to seek her and her new-boring-doctor-boyfriend, she kisses him as a symbiote, and they decide to remain friends. Between the action scenes, they never really grow as friends, which is the same problem with Eddie and Venom. By the time Venom decides to rebel against his own race, they've talked to each other maybe twice. The total of two tiny scenes we get when Eddie figures out something is wrong with him are (lobster and apartment scene) are HILARIOUS and overshadowed by the big bad.
Anyway, go watch Venom.",Venom
3813,chrismcfiggins,"Liked movie, til' the credits.",5,16 December 2018,"If it's a standalone movie,cool. I dig that. But after watching the ending credits,slipping in stuff I did not grow up with I don't dig it, uncool. Movie was good. I would even like a sequel and if that doesn't mean a SpiderMan I grew up with, make the Venom/Carnage movie one I might've read. But if it means one without out Peter Parker count me out. Like'd the movie however the ending credits, what I look forward to next, ruins it all. I enjoy a storyline that keeps going. ie...MCU (Marvel cinematic Universe and it storyline) Eddy Brock was great tho.",Venom
3814,serefcanozfen-43643,Small Evaluation,2,16 December 2018,"Just rubbish. Carrion. Despite my low expectations. I've never seen a movie so easy. Characters so boring and superficial. The story pattern is as if it consisted of random events occurring with a series of coincidences. You don't understand what happened. It's open. Neither the story nor the characters have an infrastructure. Oh, Tom Hardy. Were you the man to compromise your quality for the sake of popularity? What about Michelle Williams?

It was a great romp!I never went to see this in the theater in part because of the bad reviews and having seen it now, I'm very disappointed I didn't listen to my gut and go see it in the theater anyway.The story has a different take on Venom's origin than the comics do. Normally, I dislike too much variation from the original story line but this new version is definitely an exception and is really fantastic in my opinion. It fits great into the two-hour movie format, it makes Venom more relatable, and it still manages to grasp the essence of the character.Lots of reviews are wishing for an R rating, presumably to bring out Deadpool levels of gore and language but I really don't think it's necessary here. Venom does some rather gruesome things and I don't see any problem keeping the gore down to the level that they did.There was a great balance between character development and good 'ole Venom action. The acting was excellent, the action and effects were very well done. The Venom visuals were very well depicted (yes even without the spider logo). In particular, I loved the personality they brought to the symbiote. The relationship between Eddie (a relatively good guy who's fallen on hard times) and the symbiote (a carnivorus creature with a lack of understanding of the value of human life) is a fascinating juxtaposition and most of the time it's just plain fun!If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and see it now!",Venom
