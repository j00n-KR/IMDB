0,Hitchcoc,Let's Face It. It's Porn,2,13 March 2016,"Let's face it. Somehow this thing got legitimized by using more expensive film and hi tech movie equipment. I can just see the guys sitting there drooling because this is somehow a mainstream movie. ""Look, dear. This is an art film like the ones you are always talking about. I really don't see anything more than a bunch of explicit sex which I could pick up at any adult movie outlet if I wanted to. Of course, it could have been redeemed if there had been something new about it. The problem is that it is just plain boring. The characters are tiresome and unappealing. The plot is virtually nonexistent. Yes, there is a bit of decent cinematography, but even that is pretentious and ""artsy."" It takes away the simple presentation of the story (such as it is), and when these flashy scenes show up, they are just such obvious eye candy. Don't bother.",Love
1,kosmasp,What is Love?,6,8 February 2016,"While I didn't try to think of the song, the line ""Baby don't hurt me ... don't hurt me no more"" came to mind. And it's not like it doesn't suit or fit with the movie (if you excuse the pun). And let's get this out of the way straight ahead: If you didn't or don't already know, this movie has scenes of explicit sex in it. And it begins with a masturbation scene, to shock you right out of the gate (or those who will be offended by it of course).It goes without saying that this is full of nudity. You may not have seen this actors before, but you'll see everything of them in this. It's not only being naked physically, but also mentally. Laying emotions out there and going through motions (literally and metaphorically) is draining. Both for the actors and the viewers. The story is simple. It's about love or the idea of it.Which brings us back to our initial question. Are we able to appreciate what we have? Or do we long for things we can't have? Can we be happy with the person we spend our time or is the temptation for something new too big? Obviously that depends on the individual and their ""world"" view. Also their emotional state. The movie is as you can tell not an easy watch ... for multiple reasons. The message is clear though ...",Love
2,grantss,Had potential...but wastes it on cheap publicity stunts and a plot that goes nowhere,4,3 January 2016,"Had potential...but wastes it on cheap publicity stunts and a plot that goes nowhereA man, Murphy, is stuck in a dead-end relationship with a woman he doesn't love. The couple also have an unplanned young son, adding to Murphy's feelings of being trapped. He starts to think of his previous girlfriend - Electra, how perfect everything was, and how and why everything fell apart. Then he learns that she has disappeared...The movie had potential. The intrigue of the disappearance of Electra, the regret that their (perfect) relationship didn't work out, the suffocating relationship he is currently in, his depression over where everything has ended up - these all made for some interesting potential paths for the movie.But, alas, it was not meant to be.None of these threads go anywhere. In the end, nothing is resolved and there is no point to the whole long exercise. And, yes, it is a long exercise - 2 1/4 hours, with about half of that made up of padding. So many scenes which add nothing to the movie, and just make you more bored.From the start you know it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair - the pacing is slow from the beginning - but you hope to be rewarded with something profound at the end. No such luck.What the movie will be most remembered for is its explicit sex scenes. While not really that new anymore (Nine Songs, anyone?), many of the scenes are just there for shock / controversy / publicity value. Sad to see that Gaspar Noe has ended up making pretentious crap like this. Irreversible was brilliant and heralded Noe as director to be followed. However, since then he hasn't made a decent movie. His previous movie, Enter the Void, was even more pointless and pretentious than Love. He is turning out to be a one-hit wonder.",Love

4,ferguson-6,"Memories, regrets and lots of sex",5,5 November 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's what would normally be categorized as a cold opening, but somehow the term doesn't seem to fit the beginning of director Gaspar Noe's daring new film. A beautifully lighted, static camera opening shot lasts for a few minutes. It's startling in that the two people on screen are immersed in mutual manual stimulation in what has to be the most explicit and abrupt opening shot in film history. Red flags are waving  Mr. Noe's exploration of love has little to do with meet-cute or Hollywood romance. Instead, he dives into the harsh realities of growing emotionally close to someone, and then having it crumble  leaving only memories and regrets.Directly from that opening, we shoot ahead two years. Murphy (Karl Glusman) is now in bed with a different woman. A baby cries from another room. He goes to comfort the child as we get our first exposure to his inner-voice  he feels trapped and beaten down. There is obvious tension between Murphy and Omi (Klara Kristen) as she takes the child and he listens to a voice mail. It's a frantic plea from the mother of his ex-girlfriend (we of course know it must be the one he/we became so intimate with in the opening). Electra (Aomi Muyock) has not been heard from in a couple of months, and suicide is a real concern.This voice mail triggers an onslaught of memories for Murphy, and it becomes clear Electra was the love of his life. The memories are fired at us in the way memories do  sometimes quick, sometimes drawn out, and in a haphazard order that requires much assembly. We see Murphy's and Electra's good times and bad, understand how they mostly communicated through sex, and witness the turning point in their relationship – they invite their bright-eyed new neighbor into their bed. Just like Murphy, you may initially think Europeans are so cool and advanced to avoid the petty jealousies and fidelities that Americans so value. However, the cool bubble pops quickly when in the blink of a faulty condom, the love of one's life is gone and the morning is soon filled with the cries of a baby.Much of the above is about the story and the characters; however, it would be an injustice to remain quiet on the unusual amount of sex  explicit sex acts  shown throughout the film. Director Noe (Enter the Void, Irresistible) has always been cutting edge, but a 3D sex-filled movie is pushing boundaries for most any movie viewer. It's artfully filmed and presented, so the only thing it shares with porn is the explicit sex. It reminds of the Burt Reynolds character in Boogie Nights, whose dream was to make an artful mainstream porn movie. Perhaps that is what Mr. Noe has accomplished.However one decides to label the film, it's a no-holds-barred look at the stages of love and how it can go bad so quickly. It's also an expose' on the lack of emotional maturity of so many men (especially American) who somehow think ""protecting"" each other is a key relationship step. Murphy has one scene where he begs Electra to save them from his poor judgment, and another where he says ""sometimes it's better not to lie"". There is also a theme of French vs Americans, with an emphasis on American's propensity for war/violence and possession, rather than freedom. It's difficult to say if audiences are ready for Noe's latest, but it's clear he has something to say  and plenty to show.",Love
5,trashgang,extreme sex scene's,7,8 June 2016,"The third full feature released by the notorious director Gaspar Noé. This flick should have been his first full feature but Monica Bellucci and others turned down the offer. they have seen the script and were okay with it but once they were told it would go rather explicit they declined the offer. And in came Noé's first flick Irréversible (2002). Monica did have to go full frontal but it never became nudity and sex on the edge of porn. Stiil the flick was controversial due the 9 minute rape scene and the fire extinguisher scene. Next came Enter The Void (2009) but Gaspar still wanted to make Love. No actress wanted to go that far so he went out to clubs to find girls willing to make a movie with explicit sex scene's. Never telling them it was for the main lead he finally found 2 girls and finally Love was shot.Of course it's Gaspar, so you know it will be a long and slow flick with arty shots just like in Enter The Void and that's exactly what we get here. But this time people could be offended by the nudity. The first minute it's already a girl jerking off a guy. in front of the camera without restrictions. Is it art or porn, that became the issue of this flick. The main male lead (Karl Glusman) is known for Starship Troopers Invasion (2012) and Neon Demon (2016). He told papers that there wasn't any stand-in for his hard on or for the sex scene's. No tricks no effects, the real stuff. The story tells us a bit that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Murphy (Glusman) and Electra (Aomi Muyock) are a perfect couple but want to have a threesome with their neighbour, a seventeen year old girl. When Electra is out for a weekend Murphy and the seventeen year one have sex but the condom broke. She gets pregnant but she's never the love of his life, Electra is. And when he got a phone call from Electra's mother that she disappeared we do get to see what went wrong and go deeper into the characters. So it's about their characters and their sex lives. As I said before, it's explicit with cum shots, blow jobs, jerking off , fist f*cking and entering sex clubs to the extreme and even a transgender still being a boy but also having huge juggs. But the discussion if it's porn or not, I say not because the intercourse or genitals are never shown...It clocks in over 2 hours, maybe a bit too long. But it's Gaspar so you know what you will get. Extreme shots, long conversations and no hold barred on every count. My only question is, can he go more shocking after this one? Not for everybody but that's typically Gaspar.Gore 0/5 Nudity 4/5 Effects 0/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Love
6,MOscarbradley,"Very explicit but not in the least erotic; worse, it's boring as hell!",1,24 June 2020,"""Love"" opens with the kind of sex scene that was once only seen in hard-core porn but which now seems to be the norm in mainstream cinema. Needless to say, if hard-core porn isn't your bag or indeed the films of Gaspar Noe, perhaps it's best you give ""Love"" a miss. Indeed, if you enjoy the pleasures cinema usually offers then I would give ""Love"" a miss too. Noe is, of course, a master of controversy and his films are famous for both explicit sex and violence. They also tend to be visually imaginative but badly written and acted and ""Love"" is no exception, except perhaps that it's even more badly written and acted than most.With a title like ""Love"", of course, you might think the violence level will be minimal and you'd be right but ""Love"" isn't so much concerned with love, (the word is used a tad too often for my liking), but sex and lots of it and in 3D, too. This is a two-and-a-quarter hour porn movie but if it's porn you're after, just ditch this rubbish and stick with the real McCoy. Not that I needed proof, but this sure proves Noe is probably the most overrated director alive.",Love
7,A_Different_Drummer,A marriage made in hell...,6,17 November 2015,"... and no I am not talking about the characters in the film, I am talking about what happens when an A-list director ""falls in love"" with the idea of doing a sexually explicit film.I want to be clear about this and I think the data will bear me out. Make a list of all the films in the last 100 years by A-list directors who felt confident they could infringe on territory formerly occupied only by the porn industry and still prevail with a hit film...? Are you done? I will save you time. I did the list myself. And the answer is none, zero, zip, nada.Just like there are in the porn industry a handful of directors who constantly try to push the boundaries of their craft into the mainstream (which almost always means soft light and lots of white sheets, films that most resemble a commercial for TIDE) Noe, a brilliant artiste (Irreversible and Enter the Void were both brilliant) tried to push the envelope .. and ended up with junk mail.Sure, if you are determined to see a silk purse where others are seeing a sow's ear, you could pretend that this film has a great deal to say about men's expectations about love and marriage.But this is a review just between the writer and the reader, and we respect each other too much to lie. So I will be clear -- Noe went where angels fear to tread. And ended up with a film that, for posterity, is simply not going to make his A-reel.",Love

9,Bored_Dragon,Love porn with depth,8,8 November 2016,"Gaspar Noe is a legend. He succeeded to make a porn movie and show it at the Cannes festival.

10,Reno-Rangan,The story that was narrated backwards!,5,24 January 2017,"This was from the director of 'Irreversible'. This story was told in backwards. It opened with a married couple having sexual intercourse and after a phone call, the flashback rolls. Which begins from that point of the story where it stands to where it all began as per the film character who recalls all the events. Actually, it was impressive idea, not that reverse way storytelling, but how the characters were drawn. And then the story was very simple, like the film '9½ Weeks', the drama and the sex parts shared the remaining narration alternatively for like every 10-15 minutes.I wanted to like it, but not convinced with the blend between both the drama and sex scenes. They should have developed and blended them together better. Especially since the storytelling was reversified, one of the major plot holes is not solved or revealing what could have happened to that particular character on which this plot was developed. If you are not concerned about the storyline and looking for adult contents as in a film, not as a better porn film, then you might enjoy it.The other major issue was the length. Two hours long for an adult film means teasing and testing your patience. It should have been under 90 minutes, that would have speeded it up a bit. The actors were decent. The film poster was so hot, it will drag you to watch this film. But I would say not to expect big, either adult stuffs or from the dramatic segments. Within its frame, it delivered, but for me it was an average and a little below.4.5/10",Love
11,sol-,Memories fade and blur over time,7,2 January 2016,"Distressed and guilt-ridden upon learning that his former girlfriend has mysteriously vanished, an aspiring filmmaker loses himself in his faded memories in this characteristically graphic motion picture experience from the mind of Gaspar Noé. With his thoughts narrated aloud and intimate camera-work that constantly follows the protagonist around, the film captures the upset young man's stream of consciousness well. The non-linear nature of his flashbacks comes also across as an accurate reflection of the recollection process. Clocking in at nearly two and a half hours long though, the film runs incredibly long for a movie with such a relatively simple premise and bits and pieces grow repetitive quite quickly. Oddly enough, it is the sexually charged scenes that feel the most repetitive despite Noé constantly upping the ante with how explicit the scenes are; on the other hand, it is logical that the dialogue-heavy scenes come off better since those are the ones in which we actually see the characters interacting and learn progressively more about them. In fact, the bigger question is probably why the protagonist so often thinks of copulation when remembering his ex-girlfriend; are these the moments when he felt most intimate with her, and if they are, is he confusing love with lust? It is surely food for thought. Whatever the case, 'Love' leaves an indelible impression that is hard to shake. It is not as immersing and overwhelming an experience as 'Enter the Void', but it does a fairly decent job of handling a similarly dreamy narrative structure in which time seems to blur.",Love

13,subxerogravity,"It was a beautifully made film, with...far more than I expected!",6,24 November 2015,"Love hits you straight out of the box with the first scene. The sex was really, really graphic. I saw this movie in 2D and I can only imagine. I could not before, thinking to myself why would they make a romance movie in 3D?, but now I don't need to imagine, I can never get those images out of my head. They really went extreme.But I will say that I thought the sex scenes got me more emotionally wrapped up in the movie than the actual acting. I did like how a lot of the movie was about what is being shown and the action taking place, but I did not like the actors too much as they read their dialog, which sucks for them considering what they had to do on screen.Overall, I did find the the movie appealing. It reminds me of another movie with hardcore sex scenes, 9 songs, but instead this story about the run of a relationship is not linear, which is what made this movie interesting.It was a little hard for me to watch at times but I thought it was well done.",Love
14,andrewchristianjr,TWENTY ONE PLUS.,8,17 March 2020,"It's sexy, often beautiful, often true, and a little plodding. A non linear plot gives u a confusing timeline.

I wonder what's the difference between this film and porn?",Love
15,aciessi,Sex doesn't always sell,2,22 October 2016,"Love is Gaspar Noe's latest film. It's essentially porn. Long, drawn out sequences of sex throughout. But there's a story, and that's what could be interesting about this film. Not since the early 70's has pornographic films experimented telling actual stories instead of just getting straight to business. Nymphomaniac is the last film of the modern era that attempted this, and it absolutely blew me away. This would've been fascinating, but instead, it's PAINFULLY boring. The story line and dialogue sucks. I didn't feel for anyone in this film. The acting was extremely stilted, but in porn films that's pretty much the norm. The cinematography is the only standout. It's beautiful to look at, as most Gaspar Noe films are. However, I despised the black screen that would appear every time there was a cut. As well as the many shots of the main character standing inside a doorway with his back turned to the camera, listening to an annoying voicemail. Why did he do that? Why would he think that would work? If there's a profound reason for those two editing decisions, I'd like to know.. not that it would make me feel any differently, I still hate it. Love is not only a missed opportunity, it's a film I'll never remember, or want to remember.",Love

17,Blue-Grotto,"Lush, Passionate and Stylish",9,8 November 2015,"""If you fall in love,"" says Murphy ""you are a loser."" Only part of him believes this. The other part stalks Electra anywhere she goes. She is the source of both intense passion and pain for Murphy. Into the night clubs of Paris with their pulsing lights and vibrant colors, alleys, subways, bedrooms and showers (especially these last two), we follow the young couple. The film moves back and forth in time and is about the joy and sadness of being in love. Love is intimate in two senses of word. In one sense the sex is raw and explicit (3D explicit) and in the second sense the film really puts viewers into the scenes. It is as if we are really involved in the film. This is the characteristic style of the director. It is bold, stylish, playful, intense, non-linear and extremely passionate. Noe makes appearances in many of the scenes in one form or another (when Murphy named his kid ""Gaspar,"" many in the audience chuckled). Even the ending credits are stylish in terms of visuals and sound, and you can't stop watching even that. Noe really has the ability and courage to show such lushness in emotions and scenery. The cinematography is not as good as Enter the Void, nor is the acting, yet it isn't too far removed. Five of five stars. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival 2015.",Love

The sex scenes tie together an okay drama elevated by Noé's unique style.Artistically and technically impressive, though aside from its unsimulated sex scenes and some trippy sequences, doesn't offer the type of out-of-body experience that most Noé fans would expect.",Love

20,PIST-OFF,things fall apart,8,29 September 2018,"So it is when distinctions break down. when sex is confused for love and vice versa. when the ephemeral feels like the eternal. when self destruction becomes tantamount to pleasure and hedonism drives rather than informs the meaning of life. it is then and there that the past becomes oblivion and the future a pipe dream. it is typical of Gaspar Noe to bend, break, warp, and reshuffle time in his movies. he takes great reverie in it. it is something worth noting. here Noe takes an essentially pornographic film and attempts to infuse it with raw emotion, think Linklater's Before Sunrise or even more Charlie Kaufman's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. he does not exactly succeed for the task is impossible, but nor does he fail entirely. what must be noted or at least noticed is the lack of a future. for all the pretenses of love, for all the sexual encounters between an array of adults there is but one child in the whole movie. dozens of purported adults screwing each other into their graves and only one child to inherit a very lonely future. so it is with hedonism. so it is when you've lost distinctions between words, and meanings become meaningless. your life, your love, your existence, your home, your nation are too rendered meaninglessthe breakdown of time becomes palpable beyond the mere characters on screen. where is this Paris that they are at? does it have a past? you'd never tell from this film, and so it doesn't. without a past it must certainly relinquish it's future. again one lonely child. while i can love this movie and admire it's artistry and what it attempts to do, it must not be confused for art nor beauty. it's lyricism is that of an epitaph for a civilization. it's ugliness like ruins, a warning for the hordes who may inherit what they cannot fathom.8/10",Love

23,euroGary,A brave effort,6,8 December 2015,"Set in France, 'Love' is one of those arty films that features explicit sexual activity. Director Gaspar Noé reportedly said he wanted to create a film featuring a 'love story seen from a sexual point of view'; did he succeed?The film opens with American student Murphy getting a handjob from French girl Electra while he in turn fingers her - um - front bottom. This all seems very nice, but flash forward a few years and we see Murphy living unhappily with a different Frenchwoman (Omi), the mother of his young child. How he got from pleasant afternoon handjobs to dissatisfied (though responsible) domesticity forms the narrative of the film.There's a heavily improvised feel - and not just in the sex scenes: the more routine conversations are well played, but the frequent arguments/shouting matches are unfocused and boringly repetitive. Lead actors Karl Glusman, Aomi Muyock and Klara Kristin - the latter two apparently never having acted before being cast in this film - are competent (when they're not shouting). Muyock, especially, does a creditable job in showing Electra's rapid descent from wholesome student to attention-seeking slapper. The sex scenes are not the cold affairs some reviewers report them to be: true, they're not the height of eroticism, but they're enjoyable enough, with all three leads looking attractive sans clothes.And although the film being shot in 3D didn't add anything for me, I have to admit it made for an unusual money shot...",Love

25,Jerghal,Sex scenes can't save it from being quite boring,6,23 December 2015,"Love is the 4th feature film by Gaspar Noé. His last one 'Enter the Void' came out 6 years ago. As you can tell by the poster Gaspar does not make films for a general audience as they are mostly offensive, brutal and to a certain degree shocking (but that might be underestimating the jaded audience who these days have access to anything on the internet and as such are not easily shocked). Love might actually be his most accessible film as there is no violence but plenty of nudity and sex. Actually it's quite explicit, in the sense that the difference between real porn and this film is that 'Love' has a lot better lighting and cinematography. Now having plenty of sex scenes doesn't make it a good film. I found it rather boring actually and watched it 3 parts because it could not keep my attention. The film goes a bit like this: sex scene / fight scene (vocally, not physical) / make-up sex scene / nag scene / more sex / more nagging...you get the picture, this goes on for about 129 mins. That can get pretty tiresome. Gaspar's idea is that he wants a 'romantic' film where you also get to see the lovemaking and as we are all adults we should see it. But that in itself doesn't make this movie better. Certainly not if your characters are really not that likable. So my recommendation: see it if you are a real die hard Noé fan but otherwise skip it, there are lots of better movies released in 2015.",Love
26,tapio_hietamaki,A lengthy study of hungover sexcapades,7,2 February 2017,"There's been discussion about whether there should be sex scenes in movies at all. There are those who claim that they are distracting, offer nothing to further the story and could be skipped and nothing would be missed. Sometimes they are outright obscene. I find myself on the opposing camp. I like my movies controversial, and I think movies shouldn't shy away from subject matter because it is 'risky'. Sex is a part of life, it's emotional and intense and important, so it makes sense that movies would delve into it.Now 'Love' is a movie that borders on pornography, that's how deeply it delves into the matter of sex. The plentiful sex scenes are reportedly unsimulated - meaning the actors actually really have sex on screen, which is enough for many to label it obscene. And obscene it is. The film is full of depravity, sexual lust, fetishes, and generally morally reprehensible behavior. So if you don't go for that kind of thing, you should steer clear of this movie.I saw a review of 'Love' calling it pretentious. I don't think the movie is pretentious so much as the main character himself is, spouting off about 2001: A Space Odyssey and how he's going to be a great director. He's not a very respectable person no matter how you look at it. He cheats on his girlfriend and when he has to take responsibility and raise a baby with his hook-up, he constantly pines for his days of fooling around and doing drugs. Actually, he never really stops doing drugs.The story - and the 'message' - of the movie is about how the young American film-maker idolizes French bohemian sexuality and freedom, but ends up getting sick of too much of it. But it's not a French movie and not an American one. It's simply a Gaspar Noé movie, and it shows. There was barely any script, no guidelines or rules in making the movie. It's the director's movie, completely focused on style and theme, color and composition and rhythm, largely disregarding story and even characterization. There are frequent short 'black-outs' all over the movie, which made me think that my copy was faulty somehow. The movie has a unique flow, it's nonchronological, following the thoughts and memories of a character suffering from a terrible hangover.I have to make a comparison to 'Blue Is The Warmest Color', which really is a French movie, also has a lengthy running time, and also features a whole lot of sex. That movie was emotional and relatable, it was like a look into a life that was really lived, and despite the controversial lesbian sex scenes it strangely had a lot of innocence in it. 'Love' is like the drug-drenched, depraved, delirious and destructive, nihilistic counterpart to that movie.",Love
27,IndustriousAngel,Mostly disappointing,5,13 October 2018,"The dissection of relationships is a wellknown theme for films but this is not a good one - the main problem is the protagonist, Murphy (played by a rather bland Karl Glusman) who is, self-admittedly, only good at destroying things. It's simply neither nice nor captivating to watch a bunch of self-destructive people do their destructing, and it's also far from enlightening or enriching. Basically it's more than two hours of painful watching without any levity; the only touching scenes are the sex scenes which are really well done, far from any porn aesthetics but beautiful and the only sequences where the characters seem to enjoy themselves. Which was maybe the point but doesn't carry the story far enough to make it interesting.
The camerawork doesn't help - mostly very severe central perspectives and neatly composed still images, very much like a Wes Anderson film, but without the humour.
The music was very good, a rather eclectic mix but well chosen - along with the sex scenes, this is what saves 'Love' from being a pure disaster. Still, after the terrific 'Enter the Void' I can't feel but pretty disappointed with 'Love'.Parental advice: The characters use rather violent language in some scenes, shouting at each other and there's even face-slaps, so you might consider leaving the kids at home for this one.",Love

OK, to the review...I saw this film at the Cannes Film Festival (Loved the festival and Cannes!) So, I and many others waited for at least an hour to watch this last showing at the festival. The movie starts off with a bang - two people pleasuring each other! And intermixed with the pleasuring there's arguing and lots of it. This movie is sex scene after sex scene with a little bit of plot in between. This film was also in 3D, so the ""moneyshot"" was a bit too real. The characters are somewhat interesting, but the motive behind the relationships are very fragile. And I am not quite sure about the end. It is rather ambiguous. For the longest time, you have no idea how anyone is affording to live in Paris and what they do besides have lots and lots of sex. After a while, it's not even sexy sex. And, to my surprise, plenty of people walked out of the film well before it ended. I am glad I saw it. It was an experience, but ""Porn""...I mean ""Love"" wasn't exactly a good movie. Also, I can't see this film playing in American theaters. Even with strong editing, it'd be extremely graphic.",Love
31,JeanMoniette,What's average for Noe is still an unreachable standard for most directors.,6,21 May 2020,"Why the low rating? because in truth, 'Love' isn't nearly as impactful as it would like to be . By the time the second acts opens, you're entirely desensitised from the (real, unsimulated) portrayal of sex.The best scenes are lifted straight out of 'enter the void' and the low budget really hurts the not-so-great ones. By the times the credit roll in typical GN fashion, you'll be regretting this wasn't more akin to 'I stand alone'. I certainly did. Like many others said, the plot is this film's greatest weakness, and it goes to show that even one of the best directors on earth is unable to salvage a weak narrative.",Love
32,Manal1987,"Love, Sex and the Aesthetics of Euphemism",6,14 August 2016,"I always have problems with beginnings – the beginning of an article, the beginning of a film, the beginning of a relationship, simply because beginnings are crucial in setting the tone and pattern that will lead you all the way through till the end. Naturally being affected by all the negative social media propaganda that Gaspar Noé's Love (2015) has stirred, I was reluctant to even begin watching it because I am inclined to believe that films with explicit sexual content (except for Lars von Trier's Nymphomaniac, and I will tackle why in another review) are made either to sell like cheap porn for lucrative reasons or to assume a false air of originality and experimentation. I have finally decided to watch Love after it was recommended by a trusted friend of mine, and at the end of the day, one has to constantly push their limits in terms of artistic tolerance.Back to the beginnings, Love begins with a three-minute scene taken in one shot by a steady camera of two people having what seems to be – and what actually turns out to be – unsimulated sex. After overcoming my feelings of discomfort, I started to understand what the Argentinian director is trying to do here. Is it a pornographic scene? It definitely is. But is it meant to be sexually arousing? I would have to argue for a no. Sexual excitement requires a certain amount of build-up, but jumping directly and unexpectedly into the act generates nothing but feelings of shock and unease that would need some time to fade away.The story then unfolds in a backward linear plot. We are introduced to Murphy (the man in the opening sex scene), a frustrated young man who lives in a small apartment in Paris with his detached girlfriend and their son. The memory-evoked reversed narrative is instigated by a voice message he receives from the mother of his ex-girlfriend Electra (the woman from the opening sex scene), asking for his help to find her daughter. The man and the woman from the first sex scene are no longer strangers; we get to see how they broke up, how they managed their relationship, and finally how they met, with a heap of very long unsimulated sex scenes in between.As a voyeur (a person who discreetly watches other people in intimate, usually sexual, positions) I was extremely confused since the enjoyment element was missing. Is it because the sex scenes were too many, too long, too real, or too unnecessary? In one of the scenes Murphy says, as a cunning gesture to voice Gaspar Noé's desire, his biggest dream is to make a movie like no other that truly portrays sentimental sexuality. He also tells Electra: ""I want to make movies out of blood, sperm and tears. This is like the essence of life. I think movies should contain that, perhaps should be made of that."" Well, we see a lot of sperm and tears in that film, there is no doubt about it. It is true Love depicts relationships from an exceptionally crude, raw angle I have never seen before. Sex in cinema – and in life in general – is an uncanny subject; it lies at the essence of everything, everybody knows it is there, yet nobody talks about it overtly.. not in realistic terms at least. The film feels emotionally real. Too real. And not just when it comes to sex, but also to dialogue and performance. In one scene, Murphy tries to get Electra back and he keeps knocking on her door, after a few seconds she opens the door, apparently under the influence of drugs, and screams at him in the most deranged manner you could ever imagine. The camera does not move; it feels like a terrified neighbor watching the scene from the stairs. Most of the camera movement and angles follow the same pattern throughout the movie: the neutral uninvolved medium shot. Mid-film I realized it was not the sex scenes that made me uncomfortable but the fact that the film is devoid of any cinematic, stylistic euphemisms. In conventional romantic films, there is an invisible line separating the romantic from the sexual – love from desire. The subtle message is always: love is sublime and desire is vulgar. The reality of the things, and as presented in the film, is that both are inseparable in their sublimity and vulgarity.I cannot tell for sure whether I like it or not. Cinema, as Slavoj iek puts it, is ""the ultimate pervert art"" because it does not directly satisfy our desires but manipulates them. It does not show us our capabilities, but give us the illusion that we are capable. Cinema draws the line between imagination and reality and keeps crisscrossing the boundary: it takes imaginary elements and roots them in reality, and sugarcoats real elements in imaginary wraps. The trick is not to call a spade a spade, i.e. not to place two firm feet on one side of the spectrum; otherwise you would shake the balance between reality and imagination that the viewer cannot find in real life.Whatever your sentiments are towards the film, Noé – purposefully or inadvertently – raises some important issues: what if cinema does away with the aesthetics of presentational euphemism? Would it undermine its role as an artistic medium? Would it put the viewer on the defensive, being constantly faced with the unrefined reality of what (s)he dreads/desires?The way I see it is that Noé created an extremely stimulating film, not sexually as he probably desired but intellectually and sentimentally.I'm grateful I watched Love alone and had the chance to struggle with and make sense of all those feelings and thoughts by myself. I can imagine how uncomfortable it would be watching it in a movie theater with other people, let alone how the actors felt while shooting!",Love
33,indiedavid,Fantastic cinema,9,10 August 2016,"I understand that my comments will come off as condescending but the reality is that after reading the negative user reviews, it is obvious that the people who failed to enjoy the film are not sophisticated film enthusiasts and likely just watched because they were looking for great sex scenes. There is so much more substance to ""Love"" than sex. It is a film about complex human personalities, regret, consequences and most importantly, the complexity of human emotions and impulses. I know from the first few scenes that Elektra was a damaged person. Noe did such a fantastic job of getting the very best out of talent with limited experience. Perhaps that was the magic. A group of people who wanted to tell a story and didn't come to the project with baggage or egos.

A jerky and jump cut editing takes the viewer into a magic lantern of love and sex, like the cinema dreamed of by the protagonist that reflects the fundamentals of the cinema of Gaspar Noè. In the first meeting, before unruliness, Murphy and Elettra speak of love as a vital and luminous essence that leads to madness. They promise to protect each other but fall into the abyss of drugs and betrayals. Murphy even when Elettra has disappeared, he imagines her with him and begs God to want to return to their first night. Unlike ""Enter the void"" it is a psychedelic journey not after death but in a vital past whose memory brings alive a dead present.
This film is not a minor tragedy of Euripides' Elettra. It is not a minor tragedy to meet up with a woman who does not love and to live memories of love from the past.",Love

It was slick, stylish, sexy and trippy.Love, however fails to deliver on so many levels. I get what the director was trying to achieve here, but it just doesn't work due to the appalling acting from the very unlikable main character. Where on earth did they get him from? Was he the only actor who was willing to show his erect cock on the cinema screen? His lines are delivered with such a flat misanthropic moribund tone that you can't believe anything he says. The voice over just adds to the car crash. Its a film which lacks any real emotion or chemistry.If you want to watch a gritty film with real emotions watch Blue is the Warmest Colour and 9 Songs.

36,caramia2002,Childish and Boring,1,25 June 2020,"Gaspar should go study both Nymphomaniac films by Lars von Trier. Von Trier managed to keep his audience interested for two feature films' worth, yet I couldn't get halfway though this...mistake.The script was 7 pages long for a feature film, and it really shows. The two female stars weren't actors, but picked up by Goe at parties (""beautiful people""). Beautiful doesn't mean compelling or deep or interesting and they aren't. The all too real sex is kind of creepy, as they seem like children playing at it. For real sex, they are very disengaged. No one climaxes, no one ever breathes hard, except the guy, who gets too wrapped up in his sexual goals. Thus, there is a good reason, beyond the obvious. why sex should be acted, although I've seen much better in amateur porn vids. People who I would gladly watch a movie about afterwards. But these people...no. I was more irritated by them than anything and the terrible acting and many voice overs didn't help.If not for the sex, this film would have been lost to obscurity and thought of as Goe's unfortunate career moment. Real sex in film is not an oddity, there are millions upon millions of porn films and videos on the internet, so I'm not sure why Goe, some viewers, and some of his peers in the film industry think this is so precious and artful. What is artful about setting a camera and telling your ""actors"" to have sex? Maybe he should have told them to act like they care.",Love

38,Raptorclaw155,Love is Possession,7,10 July 2020,"Love is kind of an exhausting film to watch, but based on how the film is shot and edited, I understand that that's probably its intention.I came out of this film feeling that Love is not the idealistic thing it is made out to be. It's visceral, primal, disgusting, and somewhat like an illness. So much of this film is shot and edited so starkly that the sex scenes, especially, are exceptionally uncomfortable and bordering on repulsive to watch.Coming away from this film, it was very clear to me that this is offering criticism of the quality of millennial relationships. As youth are bound to be, this film shows how sex-obssessed young people can be but juxtaposes it with the failure of experimentation with polyamory which I found really added color and an interesting dynamic to its commentary. There's this obsession with sex and being open to the same kind of free love that existed in the hippie counter culture of the American 1960s, but millennials aren't hippies and still idealize monogamous relationships - making the celebration of free expression of sexuality to be incredibly difficult, if not, impossible.Love had me thinking but it's not a film I would recommend to the casual moviegoer or for those who aren't into the more artistic, independent side of film making.I respect this film for what it has to say as there is more to this film than what I mentioned, which gives it great thematic depth, but I can't say I want to see it again any time soon.",Love

40,Felonious-Punk,Show me how gentle you can be,10,30 November 2015,"One of the greatest movies of all time! After ""Irreversible"" and ""Enter the Void"", I thought director Gaspar Noe would have reached his peak. I thought either that, or maybe he would have nothing left to show, but this movie satisfies what the characters in the movie are looking for. Towards the end of the movie, one character bemoans the complete absence of ""sentimental sexuality"" in cinema, and proposes to supply it, and earlier, one of the characters challenges another: ""Show me how gentle you can be."" This movie is Noe's offering to that challenge. This movie continues in the recent history of French movies that seem to keep erasing the boundary between pornography and art. And yet this movie seems to be one of a kind, thanks to how personal and vulnerable it seems. It seems to be a magnum opus, as do all of Noe's works. That's part of what makes them so thrilling to watch: they all have a distinct spirit of desperation infused in them, a hunger to be great. This movie seems to be ground-breaking in its camera-work, in its story structure, in its handling of nudity and sex. And it's very beautiful. It soars where the latest movies of many formerly great auteurs seem to strain and miss. The cinematography and editing are top-rate, and there are no more devoted actors than these. The soundtrack alone deserves to have a substantial essay written on it, the way it sounds 80s yet contemporary yet futuristic, the way it sounds menacing yet romantic yet hip and yet like the soundtrack to a porno.

41,henferdeline,Best porn movie ever!,3,14 February 2016,"It is a 2:04 hours movie.Take out all the scenes where they present you with genitalia and you have a bit over one hour left. If it was a philosophical movie, perhaps there would be a part of the sex sequences that carried more meaning - but there is no such relief in this movie.We are presented with a stereotypical immature, selfish, arrogant, possessive young male studying cinema in Paris - apparently only to get stoned and laid. He meets this sweet, proactive, sexually empowered young woman that also enjoys drugs. Not the least stereotypical, as she falls for him with deep and unbridled love. His love is also deep but he is the villain here, so he get as many other women as the time not having sex with his official one allows.She notices it (who wouldn't, at this rate?) and tells him she also has had her escapades. He makes scene after scene, including beating up her lover (an ex- boyfriend). He tries to bully a police officer inside a police station.She stands by him in another stereotypical situation.Then this monster gets the pretty blonde underage neighbour girl pregnant. This is where she draws the line. Notwithstanding the fact that she was the one that suggested they get another woman in bed. Despite the fact that she made the move to invite the blondie.Then she goes down into a spiral of drugs and alcohol, shutting him off her life completely.Once more, stereotypes.He keeps the blondie, they have a little boy (that he names after the child he and the lost love dreamt to have together - stereotype, anyone?) and, as he drags himself in a pool of self-pity and despair (which does not go unnoticed by said blondie), comes the news that the original girl has been missing for a couple of months.Then he spends a full day calling people to try and find her. In the meanwhile, blondie leaves with the boy, telling him to finish his past so they could have a future.Obviously, he doesn't find her - which doesn't preclude his opium- induced dreams of her to interrupt all the time.There is a very awkward scene with him and the child in the bathtub, after blondie's face tells us she will leave him.And the movie ends with him and original girl embraced under the shower professing endless love and protection.Oh! Did I mention that it is partly filmed backwards, as 'Irreversible' was? By the way, they used a very similar setting - an underground passage - in one of the sequences. Check it out: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290673/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Or that this theme of intense, destructive, drugged and short-lived love was way better portrayed in 'More'?

43,temrok9,2001 of the erotic cinema,9,31 October 2015,"This is probably the most erotic film ever made.I didn't expect such an achievement from the director of Irreversible(a movie I hadn't liked at all).Oshima had tried to do something similar-and was given more credit to his effort than Noe-but I believe Love is better than The Empire of senses. It is filmed as a hard core movie, only with the exception that it is about love and people who are in love and have sex all the time;there are all kind of perplexities in the relations stemming all from the very nature of human feelings and human sexuality, but the film sticks to the theme of love in a way we have never experienced again in cinema.There is also a stylistic approach that reminded me of Kubrick(I do not think that it is irrelevant that the main male character says that he chose to become a director because of 2001). And last but not least, in an extraordinary soundtrack you encounter- among others- the theme from John Carpenter's Assault on precinct 13 during an orgy which can be considered the climax of the film(and I assure you, as a die-hard Carpenter fan, there is nothing ridiculous about that).So, the film may not be for everyone, but is a unique experience that does what others pose of doing, a perfect antidote for pretentious rubbish-like The Lobster-and a romantic, sensual, original and touching-if not a little too long in some parts- film that breaks through with more courage and devotion than the Warhol movies that it is referring to .A film about love in its purest form , about love as the most rewarding and torturing experience of humans.And, of course, about loss as well.",Love

It's male performers and star Karl Glusman, all have full erections. There is oral sex as well.Sadly it's not good full-feature erotica. The characters are all two dimensional and Murphy is a slut of a man that thinks he knows what love is, but can't curb his lust for other women and sex.The characters simply were not well-rounded and the film is entirely too long and I think that if it were more linear, it would have worked better. Furthermore if the film is going to have a lot of actual sex or sex acts, the director should have experimented and explored more. It's missionary, doggy style and spooning. At least be more creative.You want sexy characters to help get into the sex, regardless of the plot and talent helps.

I was actually very moved by a scene close to the end, where Murphy's son comes into the bathroom and starts crying together with his father. I usually feel annoyed when I hear children crying, but Noe showed me something that I felt truly empathetic about: a child who intuitively felt the grief of his father and them grieving together and consoling each other - it all feels very natural.

The style and leaps of time are still very attractive to me. It seems that the whole film is a stream of consciousness of Murphy. But honestly, I hated the female actress for the role, whoever she was, I thought the casting was done very poorly.After watching irreversible, Love was considerably weaker and worse.

I had to stop, walk away for a while and then return to watch this sniffling character act out his hypocrisy in such myopic detail. The relationship between the two principal characters is like oil and water. The only thing they share is a voracious appetite for sex, lots and lots of sex. The add a third person into the mix who winds up getting pregnant by the guy which leads to the main couple breaking up. Since they all were in a ménage à trois, that shouldn't have been an issue but it was. The female leaves him and we spend the rest of the film exploring his memories of her and him having more sex. They participate in orgies and he gets mad because she's having sex with other guys. He can had fun but she can't. If your life is nothing but the sex, why should that matter especially if he can participate and she can't? And there lies the quagmire with this presentation. This guy is totally immature. You become bored with him and with him having sex. Closeups of him with his exploding orgasms weren't shocking, innovative, wanted or move the picture along. After a while, you just want this story to just wrap up. You wonder what is the point? There is nothing redeeming about it. The other female character who has had his child is completely ignored. She is just another prop instead of exploring that dynamic of how they are dealing with a child together. Instead, we find his character crying in the bathtub with the toddler. And you have to ask yourself once again, the time he and his old girlfriend were together appears to be at least three years because you have to factor in the time the girl was pregnant and then you jump in time to see a toddler at least two years old. So why did his old girlfriend/s mother call him about her and why did he just started thinking about someone who hasn't been in his life for a long time? The writing was just poor. This guy was suppose to be some aspiring filmmaker. He is neither aspiring or making films and filming your naked girlfriend on a small video camera doesn't qualify you one bit.

And yes, during certain scenes people got up and left. Yet. The film doesn't argue to be anything beyond a meandering stroll into the gallows melancholy. And it does this very very well. The film features no highbrow intellectual conversations but instead, favors the same lines you've probably slung at your lovers. Again and again and again. Just like the sex you've had with your lovers again and again and again. You know their bodies and you know how to please them and above all, you know how to hurt them. Sorrow.

I have heard about this film from different resources saying that it was a hot title to watch on Netflix. I figured I would check it out, even though I had never heard about it before. I was warned that the sex scenes in the movie were quite graphic, which they are, and I am afraid that those scenes are all this film has to offer.
The premise is weak. The writing is horrible , and even the sex scenes lack passion. The best thing going for this movie is the cinematography is pretty good. That is about it.
I find it hard to imagine that someone actually financed this piece of garbage. I would be happy to know if it was filmed with a couple of Iphones, of something, because the movie has no substance. It isn't a good film, it isn't even a good porn flick.",Love

57,constanza-nm,Love is more than what you see here,5,17 July 2018,"By the reviews that I've read on this page and others calling it just porn, I assume the movie had literally just sex. I was surprised to see that the even though the sex scenes are long, it's definitely not the whole movie, neither it feels like porn. The problem relays in the fact that I've seen porn with more content than this. More artistic, better edited. That should give you an idea of what type of film this is. The protagonist is insufferable. I hated him 5 minutes into the film. And we don't get to know the rest of the characters either, in consequence, you don't really care what happens to them. The performances are mediocre. At times it truly feels like an amateur project. The shots get repetitive and boring and the dialogues fall flat. This a good idea, let's show a relationship from a sexual point of view without censoring. I appreciated that but where's the real intimacy, the real feeling. I have no idea. Nymphomaniac did it. I haven't met anyone who has seen that movie and hasn't feel overwhelmed. There's emotion, pain, struggle. The main topic, of course, is different, but I think you get the point. Love is more than what you see here. Actually, love shouldn't be what you see here.",Love
58,sportello29,"Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.",8,18 November 2015,"'Love' will most likely be discredited by many due to it's sheer honesty, like many films of it's kind are. Yet this honesty, as brutal and daring as it might seem, feels necessary to connect with and understand what the characters are going through, on an entirely new emotional level. In the words of Murphy, Gaspar Noe might have made the only movie that truly depicts 'sentimental sexuality'. 'Love' has many subtle and not-so-subtle references to the underlying story and to the director himself. Gaspar's mother is named Nora Murphy, while Murphy's son is named Gaspar and Electra's ex boyfriend - Noe. His favorite movie is Kubrick's '2001', while hers is Lang's 'M', both of which seem to fuel Murphy and Electra's behavior throughout the movie, where Murphy is often aimlessly overwhelmed with hope and desire, while Electra seems unable to forgive.Gaspar Noe constantly cuts through the past and the future, using the techniques he is so familiar with since Irreversible. The movie abruptly switches between various stages of Murphy's and Electra's relationship, always cutting back to the present, where Murphy's is in absolute emotional agony and despair, raising a child with Clara. At times Murphy and Electra are so deeply engrained in one another that their fights and dialogues seem outright comical and immature, as if we are observing a 16 year- old couple. But this is truly where 'Love' stands out. Being in love feels and looks exactly like this, it's raw, emotional and brutal yet foggy and sweet; when no one else exists or matters.In one of Electra's and Murphy's conversations they talk about the sad reality that they are going nowhere and dragging each other down, they discuss taking a break. It is an extremely sad and emotional scene, where the thought itself brings so much fear into them, that they simply end up holding each other even tighter.The script for 'Love' is only 7 pages long. It is full of beautiful and weird dialogues and extremely emotional, 'free-played' graphic scenes. These scenes however are not there to impress the viewer or open the doors to the unknown. This is also not a nymphomaniac-like sexual exploration. Gaspar Noe does a masterful job in showing us the true emotional aspect of love, in it's raw and relatable form, sex.The sound-score is stunning, with the music gradually changing depending on the mood and the context of the scenes. Even though a lot of times it seems like we are watching the same people 'fuck' in the same positions, different context, feelings and music make each of these scenes truly unique and mesmerizing on it's own. Noe also does a wonderful job in his minimalistic depiction of the story and the scenery. Murphy and Electra always wear contrasting colors, while the background is usually very simple yet fitting to them both. As if to say that when in love, everything should be seen through the eyes of the lovers. 'Love' might sometimes seem silly, overly graphic and way too sentimental, yet it hits all the right notes.",Love

60,lougadou,Most intimate and vibrant,8,14 April 2017,"First of all. I'm a huge fan of Gaspar Noé, so my review may be biased somewhat by that. Still, this movie delves into subject matter very unlike Enter the Void, and differs greatly also in its flawless execution. There are many silent moments, as is Gaspar's style, but they aren't empty and vacuous, like in Enter the Void, meant to render in the viewer a sense of aimlessness and confusion, and they're not meant to give you a respite from the vibrant sexuality of the film either. Instead they suffuse exactly the tender sentiment Gaspar was seeking to meld into his project. The film is a tremendous achievement, his somatic style vibrates from the screen and seduces you into the physicality of love. You feel aroused, no doubt, but it's an enveloping arousal, not the two dimensional kind of appeal one would expect from a movie with this caliber of sexuality. No, this is four dimensional; indulgent and honest and raw and desperate and human. The spectacular performances by the relatively unknown actors deliver aching, intimate and haunting sensations. You're there with them. That's the director's touch and it's not easy to achieve. The story is very deep, its foreground tragedies very sharply felt and you're left sad, vulnerable, full of regret and yet also gratitude that you were able to experience love of that magnitude, with all its divine glory and cruelty without actually being stuck in the characters lives. And yet it was a just a movie. And yet it wasn't.",Love
61,sssnaky-856-782861,Watch porn.,3,28 November 2015,"I have nothing against sex. I love it, I love watching it but this was painful. The sex was hot but the story and the acting was terrible. I think it was not worth it and very very long. I can see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark. For the same kind of story with the sex dial down and the story dial up I would suggest The Dreamers. This story could be told in about 30 min, add maybe 30 min to get invested in the characters and that would be good. 2h is way to long for this and 5 min sex scene every 10 min is too much. Like the title says. Watch porn it will be more fulfilling.Now for the actual review. The plot is simple. It is a guy reflecting on a past relationship. The guy is a little to dysfunctional to be in a healthy one but it is not extreme. The only real question you have during the movie does not get answered and that is about it. I would not recommend this to anyone.",Love

64,DigitalShark1,Not as artsy or good as it thinks it is,4,6 October 2021,"I genuinely want my two hours back.Love is a newish film by Gaspar Noe. It's a romantic tragedy that's less Romeo and Juliet and more Chasing Amy if it was written by someone who's had a lot of bad sex recently. But since it's a Gaspar Noe film, his fans will come flocking to it and probably consider a masterpiece without even seeing it because it's got actors having sex in it.For the record, don't think me some button-up karen who scorns at a film for showing people having sex. I am absolutely fine with live actors having sex in a film but that does not necessarily make it more artsy or groundbreaking. Love takes itself incredibly seriously despite having very little to offer. It's sex scenes feel redundant as we watch the same three boring characters having sex in different situations. Unfortunately there's not one character in this film that's relatable or likable unless you can relate to being knocking up a french girl on a study abroad program and can only think about how it's somehow that girl's fault.I would say this movie is 50% sex scenes and 50% medium close up shots. 40 minutes into the movie I was thinking ""Wow, this guy really loves his medium close ups"" in fact maybe Gaspar loves them a little TOO much and he shoots pretty much every scene in the exact same frame that makes every show feel like the same.I think Gaspar Noe is a talented filmmaker but ultimately think this is a pretentious annoying project.",Love
65,kim_smoltz,Well-made project but ends up tripping over its own interpretation of reality.,6,16 July 2018,"Overly ambitious project about a millennial love arc that ends in heartbreak, but what are the lessons learned? Murphy (Karl Glusman) is an open-minded film student in Paris who meets Elektra (Aomi Muyock), and the two embrace their high sex drives with giddyness. However, after the relationship embraces polyamory and swingers culture, only one of the two is emotionally stable enough to handle it.The film is directed really well by Noé, who by now should know well enough how to make it all super claustrophobic and uncomfortable for the viewer. The cinematography is good but relies too heavily on saturation but it's never really an issue. Nonlinear storytelling is clear, concise, and there's some really neat editing at parts. The story does drag often, and the film overall could've cut out 10-15 minutes of filler.The real issue with ""Love"" is the lack of chemistry between Murphy and Elektra -- we just don't see it, pretty much ever. The writing is there, but the actors just cannot grasp it. This is largely because -- are you ready? -- they aren't actors; Noé met both Glusman and Muyock in a club one night and asked them to star. It's clear that he wanted to achieve the most organic and natural relationship dynamic on-screen by not using ""real actors"" -- but in what is supposed to be an emotionally charged film, that just doesn't work.In fact, in a sort of disturbingly surreal manner, the very same issues that the film is trying to highlight in millennial relationships (emotional maturity and boundaries over sex) seem to show up in the unsimulated sex scenes between Glusman and Muyock. Glusman constantly falls out of character, allowing his own sexual desire to ruin the scene and any emotional impact Noé was looking for. Muyock seems bored and uninterested -- and who could blame her? -- likely due to Glusman's obvious zeal about getting paid to fuck her. I'm not sure he entirely understood the fact he was in an art film, and in remaining ignorant, he ends up verifying Noé's entire thesis: young adults, especially men, get lost in the idea of sexual nirvana over the thing that truly matters: love.The second half of the film lifts the veil on Murphy's narcissistic and emotionally abusive behavior in the relationship, and tragically, Glusman is a good actor when portraying an unstable douchebag (and Muyock is phenomenal when screaming at him).The film finishes the same place it starts, seeming to depict Murphy at rock-bottom in a horrible and accidental family dynamic: a fitting bookend to a relationship that was destroyed not by too much sex, but his own fear of it. The ending is eerie and powerful, and hints at the generational ripples that will be felt for decades because of his own actions. It's a great story, and sort of well-acted, but it ends up merely tripping up on its own interpretation of reality instead of offering us anything particularly new.",Love

I get that sex was important in there relationship and it would be fine to show that but Jesus christ does this movie spend a load of time with it. I found the interactions between characters much more interesting. Just too long and the payoff was.. OK I guess it's a tragedy piece in a lot of sense but the landing was meh.

Later one I thought to myself that the movie does exactly that, but had it not being pointed out to me directly, I would have thought of the movie a lot more. Also at a few points during the movie when I thought the sex scene was long, I looked around and like the photography; have I not pieced together that the protagonist is self-serving, I would have taken it a lot more in consideration of my appreciation.Also what was the point of showing the swinger/orgy place? Is it to show they reconciled each other for their cheating and now are open? Was it necessary to take so long to make that point? I like seeing real sex in a movie. They took it to a new level, although not from afar as Shortbus was pretty filled with sex. I think I just figured out why the orgy place chapter...I like a lot the tension between the 2 lovers, but writing this I'm realizing the protagonist is missing her so much but he haven't been this way all along, it's only because he got news of her.",Love

71,Style_is_Substance,"Love, actually",9,18 April 2016,"Through his raw and often disturbing approach to cinema, Gaspar Noé continues to demonstrate himself to be one of the most innovative directors of today. I am quite fond of The Butcher trilogy (Carne, I Stand Alone, and Irreversible) as well as what I consider to be his magnum opus, Enter the Void. Frankly, Love is not as great as those other films mentioned, but is still quite good in its own right, and offers a lot more under its surface than one may expect or notice.Noé once said ""there is no line between art and pornography. You can make art of anything . . . Anything that is shot or reproduced in an unusual way is considered artistic or experimental."" With this belief in mind, explicit filmed sexual content can be art, but that does not necessarily make it good art. Good art in my opinion, often raises comments or questions on something in life or philosophy, whether it is in its context or its subtext. Love, I think, is good art, through its creative and experimental approach in film making and the commentary and questions it raises.The film on the surface, is an erotic melodrama with easy-to-hate characters and an abundance of explicit sex scenes. However, I strongly believe this is all intentional on the behalf of Noé, as he offers commentary and visual insight inside the intimacy of a sexual charged relationship.It should be NOÉ surprise that the film's commentary is on sex and its effects on a relationship and the individuals. The film was released in 3D, allowing the audience to view the couple in their most intimate state as close to the viewer's eyes as possible, whether they'd like to or not. The sex scenes are mostly honest as they are neither simulated nor rehearsed. The opening shot acts as a thesis for the film to come, as two naked characters engage in a sexual act; the film going straight into the ""action."" The film is told non-chronologically as Murphy, the young cinephilic protagonist and wannabe film-maker, looks back at his past relationship with Electra that ended due to unfaithfulness that lead him to having an unplanned child and staying with the mother, whom he grew to detest. Told through flashbacks, the story unfolds revealing more details about his sexually charged relationship with the emotionally unstable Electra. Most of the explicit sex scenes, once properly examined, appear to not be shown to arouse the viewer, but rather demonstrate the joy and pleasures of sex, and the importance sex can be within a relationship. Interestingly in more quick and less explicit nature, sex is also shown throughout the film in a more negative context, or leading to negative consequences when Murphy is shown cheating on Electra. I would argue that the film showcases that sex is meant to be between two people alone but presents the opposite side of the argument as well before refuting it. Murphy feels he must own Electra, going as far as to defend his manhood and his possession (Electra) by smashing glass against another man's head who appears as a threat to him and his relationship. Infidelity and excessive experimentation leads to tension and heartache within the relationship. The long sensual threesome scene fulfills both Murphy and Electra's sexual fantasy, but ultimately leads to Murphy having sex with the other woman again in secret and accidentally creating a child. This forever ruins his trust with Electra, all due to sex corrupting his mind.Murphy, throughout the film is a regular man corrupted by sex. To be frank, he is a jerk. Almost every conflict arises from the characters giving into unhealthy sexual temptation and then facing the consequences of it. Murphy faces the consequences of his actions and begins to regret and fall into depression, especially after hearing Electra had gone missing. He never meets up with her again, she remains in the past, only for him to further take responsibility. He looks back at his relationship and while most of it was in fact sexually excessive to an unstable and unhealthy degree, he truly loved Electra on an emotional level. Their mutual emotional bonding can be demonstrated in a flashback in which the two simply talk and stroll a park. The audience never learns the final whereabouts and fate of Electra's character, which I believe works well for the film. She is in the past, Murphy must take action and become a man. His biggest regret is not having a child with her. The film seems to argue that the objectively greatest thing about sex is the fact it can lead to another's birth. Two people create another. He made a baby, who he admittedly loves, with a woman who he doesn't. Murphy realizes he had never experienced the greatest thing love could had offered between him an Electra, the miracle of birth.",Love

The sheer length of the sex scenes (way beyond what is necessary to establish the feeble gist of what scant plot there is) tells you all you need to know.A CCTV camera in a college dormitory would produce a better film.Having said that, the filming and lighting is good for the most part so kudos to the technical team.",Love

The depth of her character and her flaws are also deeply rooted in the story and its themes.There is a poster of ""Taxi Driver"" hanging on the wall of the room of the main character and I think that ""Love"", like ""Taxi Driver"", has the potential to become a film that will be studied for the ages to come.The 3D was good but I think it could have been slightly better.The only negative aspect that I can think of are that the sex scenes did occasionally become repetitive somewhere halfway, but only sometimes.",Love

It takes a lot to make me watch a film twice especially a new released. It's an arty and very well made film about love. It's not always rainbows and butterflies. What I love about Gaspar Noe is he takes risks and experiment with the films. Most of his films are controversial then people start liking it as no one likes a change in the beginning and I love creativity. This film has a very simple plot, simply made with simple acting if you want to watch it expecting some unrealistic cheesy rom com Hollywood commercial film because name of the film is LOVE then this is not for you. Reading people reviews here, repetition of the word ""PORN"" because of unsimulated sex scenes and a lot of sex scenes. There is a good story to the film and the sex scenes compliments with it. I have always been in favour of unsimulated sex as it is one of natural act which every adult goes through. It's about time when people should watch sex scenes without feeling uncomfortable and without the idea that every time you watch unsimulated sex scene you have to play with yourself. I just find it ridiculous, it is just a natural act. Get over it and fix your brain. If people feel uncomfortable with that do some research before you go and watch a film if unsimulated sex makes you feel uncomfortable why did you go on the first place to watch it?A great film !! must watch !!",Love

76,phenriquessilva,Youth's emotional ruin,4,18 June 2021,"First, it's necessary to keep in mind that the film is (kinda of) inspired by the director himself (Noé) and his circle of friends in the cinematographic environment. The purpose of the film is to portray the troubled love and sexual relationships of millenials - which, at first, it's inferred that it'll be something deep.However, the film ends up juggling to reach a neither great nor terrible level. The timeline can be confusing, but it's far from being the film's downside, it just adds up to a whole host of problems.There's A LOT of (explicit) sex, wich in a moderate way would not be a problem, however the scenes are VERY long, around two minutes each (in a two hours long movie). It gets tiring - but the (minimum) ideia of what role sex plays in this generation of young people is there.The female characters are hypersexualized, occupying a prominent position in the scene. Men in the background. The problem is not the prominence itself, but the way it is meant to be perceived. However, I expected this when I read a statement by Noé in which he said ""with a short (film) you are allowed to do whatever you want. It's like if you have a girlfriend and she tells you that you can do whatever you want. That's very exciting.""The film makes positive points by portraying heterosexual relationships in a generation considered ""cool"" and ""advanced"" in social terms, showing how it's done, the sequence and escalation of emotional and psychological abuse. How the ""nice"" guy is actually a big idiot.The film certainly lacked depth, several insinuations were made, but they remained to be developed. One of the insinuations, which would certainly mark positively allied to the love narrative of this youth, is about the internal battles of each one. The film introduces a little bit about the problems that both Murphy and Electra face within themselves, but it doesn't develop. Personally, I think it would have been extremely interesting and fruitful to develop Electra's innermost pains - when she says she's not proud of all her past... that hits different.Much is complained about the performance of Muyock and Glusman - pertinent. It's not the usual dramatic acting, it's like we're having privileged access to a troubled relationship - it's kind of a ""natural"" acting (?). However, this ""dry"" acting seems to have been the director's intention - and I also wonder about the limits placed by the script. However, personally, the acting didn't even arouse negative feelings in me, the tense moments I think are well done. Something about Aomi Muyock's acting is captivating - what makes her character, Electra, captivating. There are times when something about her hits us, such as her facial expressions, her small smile, the look, the way she speaks, even when she's silent - considering the internal battle she seems to be fighting.A good movie with good intentions that fails to carry them out becoming tiring - also lighting, photography, techniques and camera work are good.",Love

Not too much, not too little.It's a movie that stays with you, makes you rethink and challenge your own perception of the correlation between love and sex as basic elements that sustain human life. It has a liberating effect on the viewer's psyche and therein lies its unique quality.

DOGmata were thrown to the DOGS, even though the church didn't experience times of adversity in the West, unlike in our country, in long-suffering Russia; and in the world of popmusic, that happened a couple of decades sooner than in cinema, and let me express my view, why.

But as for dance floors, there's hardly anyone but youth, and they haven't had dubious glances on themselves in ages. A pop band plays free-and-easy hits; everybody sexually hunts everyone; and what causes that small culpable circle to move, are ecstasy Disco Biscuits. But even before the disco time, time of messing about, the sexual revolution won in terms of clothes! 40-45 years ago, even for those times, and even in Russia, it was unlikely that anyone, except old grannies in their senility maybe, would be outraged at wearing short dress or a miniskirt by a young girl. Because all sane people understood: the majority wore shorts and mini not because they were sexually driven and preoccupied with sex. Girls feel HOT but it has nothing to do with being HOT, it's just summer weather! All in all, after comparative equality of men and women had come and condoms as well as birth control pills had flooded the market of everyday goods, sexual revolution began to advance with giant strides, no doubt about it. As a result, the present is full of TV music videos with blue subjects like cherries with cream, passionate glances and sighs, and satin female bare feet; what is the most popular book, is an erotic novel ('Fifty Shades of Grey'), which has beat even 'Harry Potter', 'Twilight' and 'The Lord of the Rings'. Thanks to the marvellous success of the bestseller #1, the film of the same name showed box office running into $ half a billion. All the rest films of 'free-and-easy' content still fail in business, but that's certainly not because they are not desirable; people are just still too shy to visit such showings, concerned about being caught by those acquaintances who consider the word 'sex' to be a synonym for 'lechery'...At that, all the hypocrisy around having sex is due to nothing more than the fact that sex organs, by some natural reasons, perform excretion functions as well... That's the only thing these organs came in for their 'ill fame'; but if they weren't connected with excretion in any way, no-one, I'm quite sure, would ever think about sex blameworthily! And the words literally (with neither biological terminology nor euphemistic connotation) nominating these organs and what they do - would never be considered 'dirty'!But it's high time to give up speculating about 'what would be if pigs had wings'; they would be angels, huh; if is a big word. Here comes 'Love' by Gaspar Noé. First of all, I can't but express my indignation at the virtual ban of it with us in Russia! It was shown officially just once, in Saint Petersburg, with some well-known oppositionists attending the showing. This dismisses the suggestions adduced in my reviews of the films 'Pouta' (Czech Republic) and 'Pouhdistus' (Finland): I said they were not 'banned', just ignored by Russian distributors on the grounds of unprofitability... I should have had not high opinion of our powers that be! I should have known that market laws wouldn't work any longer if politics intervenes in various branches of life!But what I'm still convinced of, is that it's public opinion in Russia that allows these people rule! It was curious for me to look through the 'Love' reviews posted by Russians! There were of course a couple of odd opinions. A religionist lamented his bitter fate: he was unable to drop the filmmakers in hell pan. A young woman lapsed into daydreams of her bygone love. But by and large, the prevailing public opinion can be reduced to: 'this is not the film we in Russia are in need of'; the whole globalising world doesn't keep in step - our beloved Russia is the only one who keeps in step. (Such a wild sentiment is just perfect for the current regime.) Some extolled Noé's talents to the skies and tried to find a black cat in a dark room, but there was no cat. Very few reviewers treated the film impartially. Namely, as just a film with mission to show that the civilisation (not Russia, though, I'm sorry to inform you!) has latched onto a fine art house film with sex as the lion's share of runtime! The box office is low, extremely low in comparison with 'Fifty Shades', but art house films are always getting next to nothing in comparison with blockbusters, not much of eyeopener! A 3D art house, are you kidding?! That Noé sure wanted to snatch a large sum. That you would probably ask me. And I'd answer: 3D here is not a blockbuster attribute, just a ground-breaking technical spec: the 'first 3D nearly-pornographic mainstream' status makes 'Love' a pioneering film!",Love

Some of the scenes are in fact very graphic but what they portray is not porn....For anyone that has lived through some of the scenes in this film it will be very easy to understand why they were included. This film portrays life as it is for some. Those that have not lived these moments will have a very hard time understanding their necessity..This film portrays much of the torment that flows through the minds of those that have been caught up in the intimacy of a profound mental and physical relation that goes beyond the stereotypical roles that contemporary and politically correct society likes to show.The film is dark, full of anguish, torment, fear and pain when confronted with the elation of powerful love and sex.It is a film about emotion, from a darker point of view, it is a film about those on the edge, about real people, living real lives.The director, with an obviously limited budget, has taken a very deep subject and, in my opinion, successfully portrayed the moments and situations which arise through such a period in one's life.This film does not make you smile, it forces you to look at another level of this mortal coil...Not for everyone, as it requires an open mind and a minimum of knowledge of one's feelings and thoughts.",Love

Like many of his movies, nobody is good or bad, just humans that do human things. I enjoyed his perspective when stuck with his new 17 year old partner and child, and thought it was refreshing the way in which he messes everything up, leaving room to still sympathize with him. My main issue is I was unable to fully sympathize with any of the characters: the well to do American living in Paris and falling in love with another well to do french girl in art school (of course a threesome is in order) was just a bit too on the nose for me, and took away some of the depth of the characters. Further, Murphy's blatant masculinity and Americanisms also felt more like a caricature than a character, and ultimately made him less interesting.",Love
84,sisilovesu,This film is actually brilliant.,7,21 August 2016,"I know I only rated it a seven out of ten but that's because I admit this film's faults. It certainly isn't near perfect but I felt very moved by the characters and their story. Lots of people may not be able to relate to this film however those of us that do can say that everything about this depiction of love has been experienced and is real. As a grown single adult living in today's dating world I can attest that the relationship between Murphy and Electra exists. Their obsession with each other and with sex that led them into a deep and possibly unreal infatuation was honest and thought provoking. Love sometimes doesn't make sense and can't be described or made logical. Their connection was what drove them into darkness, madness and despair. Love is completely all consuming on any level it's represented on. So many times have I given myself up for something that a year later I looked back on and couldn't reconcile my behavior, and so many times have I given myself up to something to only sabotage it before it completely devoured me. I don't know if I have been in love, but I have felt what these characters are going through and I wouldn't know what else to call it. In the vein of Harmony Korine and Lars von Trier I think Gasper Noe is a genius. Yes this movie is uncomfortable, yes the acting isn't great and yes the story is dry, but it's a genuine take on what relationships look like for some people in their mid twenties to early thirties and I loved every second of it.",Love

86,sam-519,A warning on the power of intimacy,9,30 September 2017,"Noé has never been one for making upbeat, happy films and Love is no different. It is, in essence, a love story, but moreover a lust story about how we can become imprisoned by our emotions via our need for validation and fulfilment. We can become captive physically, emotionally, situationally, psychologically. Love is told in typical Noé fashion: starting with the most recent events, it draws us rearward in time through a series of flashbacks before simultaneously presenting us with the root cause of the dire consequences the past has wrecked for the main character, Murphy. Murphy is an American in Paris in film school. One day he meets the beautiful artist Electra at a party and the two find that they have similar views on love, life and a shared need for intensity. They quickly form a relationship and their sex life is very healthy: they have sex frequently, intimately, closely, Electra at one point challenging Murphy to show her just ""how tender"" he can be. Unfortunately, acting out their sexual fantasies ends up proving the demise of both their relationship and their freedom when they have a threesome with Omi, a slim, pretty 16 year old blonde who moves in next door. Murphy continues a relationship with Omi behind Electra's back and Omi falls pregnant, deciding to keep the baby since she is ""pro life"" in contrast to Murphy who is ""pro choice"". Electra and Murphy split, leaving him to bring up the child in his own flat with Omi, a situation with damages his freedom and his creativity, eventually leading to depression. Electra disappears and becomes uncontactable, most likely committing suicide, as she threatens to do if the relationship between her and Murphy collapses.The film heavily centres on the duality of the past and the present. Within Murphy's Paris flat, the past is usually lit in red, emphasising excitement, sexuality, passion, danger, risk. The present, on the other hand, is lit in green, a safe, benign, calm, but slightly sickly colour being the opposite of the libidinous red. The 'red' scenes are mostly at night whereas the 'green' scenes are in daylight with rain pouring down outside, signifying the sadness of Murphy's inescapable situation. When Murphy is with Electra in the flat the flat is a mess: it is full of film posters, books everywhere, it is a very much an artist's flat. With Omi it is stark, organised, clean, controlled. It is the flat of a family man disciplined by his situation and his female. Murphy feels constantly trapped, keeping one shelf of his 'old life' tucked away in the corner, his old life made entirely of memories of Electra. On the shelf is a VHS (not a DVD, again signifying age and format change) of Noé's first film I Stand Alone, a nod to times gone by, personal development and the fact that, in the end, we are indeed all by ourselves. Murphy remarks in his mind that when one invites a female to live with them it's like ""getting in bed with the CIA"", absolutely everything is known, there is no privacy, no identity and little freedom.Of particular note is the sex in the film, which is explicit and frequent. This is typical of Noé, he presents real-life situations unglossed by some ultimative veneer. The sex in the film is not only meant to titillate but to show intensity and intimacy and the beauty of closeness between couples. It draws us into the moment, as it does the featured characters. But it also shows us the difference between types of sex (and types of love): when Murphy and Electra are alone enjoying each other it is beautiful, close, almost enviable, but when they have their threesome with Omi it feels awkward at times, forced, maybe not how they imagined. At one point in the long sex scene with Omi Murphy penetrates Omi from behind with Electra enjoying her on the other side: in this way it is the start of Omi 'getting between' the two of them. In essence, as with so much of Noé's work, Love is a warning. It is a warning about the consequences of making bad choices. The backwards-style storytelling shows how Murphy gets himself trapped in a situation through nothing but his own lust for Omi – it is entirely his fault after all – and as he says the only thing he is good at is ""f---ing things up"". In the process of following his emotions, his own lust and need for intimacy, he throws away his relationship with Electra, his creativity, his old life, whereas Omi also falls prey to her emotions by deciding to keep her child (her reasons for being pro-life whilst also being a meat-eater appear emotional rather than rational too, when challenged by Murphy on this point she has no reason other than ""well, it's different""). At the end of the film Murphy fantasies/reminisces about holding Electra in the bathtub of his flat, where in reality he is now holding Gaspar, his child, with Omi outside in the hall, outside of his subconscious. The borders of the screen shrink to a square to emphasise the captivity of his situation, the white tiled walls of the bathroom, where his happy memories of Electra began, appearing now like the walls of an asylum or a concentration camp. As is told so many times in the film, love is the greatest thing in life... but with great power comes great responsibility. Love of any kind can be beautiful, exciting, passionate and fulfilling, but it carries risks, and mistreated and unchecked, it can bring unwanted results. Love is more powerful than we often care to admit to ourselves, and with this film Noé is showing us the largely negative consequences of love on freedom. As Murphy is told by one of his ex girlfriends: when you fall in love, you ultimately lose out.",Love
87,zoncolan0,you should see this... to remember the potential of the art of cinema,7,14 May 2020,"Although Gaspar Noé claims this movie is a love story in the perspective of sex, i felt vice versa. Sex which is crafted beautifully and bravely is more dominant and attractive througout the film. The way love is written, however, is one of the worst amid the romance movies: shallow, basic, dull. I personally felt that if we took out the sex which became a routine from the life of the couple, there would be no relation anymore, they'd completely divide as if they were binded by only sexual feelings. Acting sucks too. I wish it took an hour less which must suffice to present what , i think, is aimed.
On the other hand, I anyway enjoyed a lot to witness rare explicit piece of photographic art. What is dared and produced is going to remind itself to me for long years even if we do not come across again.",Love

Murphy on the other hand is profoundly mentally ill. The movie should have been called ""Borderline Personality Disorder"". The writing is pure high school and Karl Glusman is as wooden as any slab rider on CSI. There is essentially no plot and none of the characters evokes any response in me - well maybe loathing for Murphy - what an (expletive) excretory orifice! His violence and his justification for his mindless violence - ""I'm an American an we fight for what's ours blah blah"" - the police don't stick him in jail but befriend him - what? He's with hot Electra and they go to a sex club - he has few women whilst there but loses his tiny mind when he finds her with a guy and a woman (a dream scenario) - hello stupid - it's Paris not Des Moines!! Why would you go/stay in Paris if you're a narrow minded pillock?

91,wwodka,A great movie for anyone with an analytical mind,9,19 March 2019,"Honestly, this is the first movie I ever watched from this director and I am amazed. I found his name by searching for directors similar to Nicolas Winding Refn.To get right to it, the opening scene is a little shocking but its cause I'm an american and used to movies not showing that stuff right off the bat. But it wasn't anything to get freaked out or something that would make me walk out of the theater.Once you get over the fact that it is sex then you start to analyse the scenes. Notice how Electra doesnt seem entirely there in the threesome. He is more into the other girl than her. I took this as a foreshadowing moment which this director did a lot of in the movie. Notice how its always sex with the two of them.Something that struck me was he always used the phone while standing in a doorway. This is another element to his character. It reveals a lot about their relationship as a hole.The music score is great and I picked up on the Pink Floyd songs. Another great attempt at foreshadowing.But, the one thing that really got me was the use of colours. Notice the red green orange and yellow that pops up from time to time. I believe red means pain, orange means love, green is fear and yellow is shy. The scene at the party where he messes around with the girl in the bathroom. Notice how the entire room is red and the bathroom is green. He is afraid at first to mess around with the girl because of Electra. But if you paid attention the scene prior when the two were talking to each other in front of Electra, they were in a red room and you couldn't help but feel the pain from electra as she had to watch him flirt.The entire movie is really about his narcissism and it plays well. I'd really like a sequel in which its in her point of view. To watch the same scenes over but get her thoughts would really make this come full circle.",Love

On the other side: I found the script / plot to be thin, and the acting and voice overs were terrible. I got the idea this was a movie made by an American director who was trying to make a 'european' style movie but didn't succeed. Afterwards I read the director is French (born in south America).The movie lasts more than 2 hours, but there is no suspense, no buildup, etc. Karl Glusman (the lead actor) is not credible in this role, the emotions don't seem real and his voice-overs are even worse. His character begin a 'movie director' or something of the kind seems almost irrelevant and implausible.After an hour, the movie started getting tedious as it was obvious this 'wasn't going anywhere'. I don't recommend seeing it, unless you're only interested in the raw sex in 3D (but remember... it's more than 2 hours you have to sit through).",Love

94,michaelktyee,Skip the nudity and sex for the real meat,8,20 December 2015,"There's a moment when the protagonist, American ex pat Murphy, tells his Parisian girlfriend, Alektra, that the police officer understood him and wants to have a beer sometime. This is all after a public altercation fueled by jealousy and alcohol that leaves the audience wanting to dump Murphy as well in that moment.And yet the policeman actually does share a beer with Murphy later in one of the film's more poignant scenes, sharing understanding as mutual and not simply one way or curtailed by gender stereotypes.Gaspar Noé's 'Love' is a film that thrives on shock, sentimentality and a relay of connotations. Everything is in a relationship; the characters and the big ideas it looks to tackle. There's a cynicism voiced in this film against extreme, contemporary western views (mainly American), which in a sense liberates the stigmas one might have towards perceived French social norms: love, sexuality, self expression and most importantly tact or manner.I found myself lulled by the ongoing and over-extended sex scenes, — shot beautifully by the way — rather than anything gratuitous coming from them. It's interesting to note that in both scenes where relationship complications arise and are dealt with, as well as the (make-up) sex, everything in these moments are left to their devices, almost playing out in real time, allowing a greater sense of empathy for the audience, even if what's on the screen is severely perverse and daring, if you happen to be a sexually active, romantically charged human being, then the director seems to take a nod in saying ""Hey, this is real life."" Letting these moments play out feels more thoughtful than overly intellectualizing them, almost as if to excuse the t&a/c&b, something Lars von Trier felt more necessary in 2013's 'Nymphomaniac', a film which will undoubtedly draw comparisons, though Love shouldn't be mistaken as such; there's no high stakes, money or power play. It's just all a bit complicated and messy. But brutally honest nonetheless.Murphy can be a little nonredeemable at times, one of the few protagonists in a while worth caring for, but hardly worth rooting for, especially when he's coming in your (the viewer's) face. It's good this movie isn't shot/screened in 3D. Also the characters are at times lost for words... as if there is a complete absence of script. This isn't an all bad thing as it makes the interactions feel more natural, however a repeated cycle of ""I hate you!"" for about 3 to 5 minutes straight starts to feel like a fill in the gaps exercise.Overall this film is art/indie cinema when it works best. You feel the director completely and utterly devoted to style and substance without sacrifice on either part. The casting is done well and through all the nudity no single actor or actress is relegated to feeling like they're shooting porn, something I feel a lot of critics and PC audiences will claim in their shallow analysis'.",Love
95,julibufa,The reason why it's divisive it's not the reason why it falters,4,22 September 2021,"Noé met the two main actresses at a party, apparently, and the main actor was just an acquaintance. It seems that the relationship has been professional and fructiferous for everyone involved. As long as we know that, we can objectively analyze wether its overtly erotic nature has a point to it. Does it fundamentally disturb any of the movie's intent? Not at first, it does have a thesis.Love attempts to be real. The contrast the title makes with the subject matter is very rarely do we relate love directly to sex in art, even though in many cases there's a lot of important details relating these two concepts. Quite honestly, I admire how it intends to show a human, sexual relation in depth and privacy. It ""shocks"" us because even if we've been through these experiences ourselves, we are not sure how to feel about it existing on screen, that's what Noé is pointing out.We are introduced to the main character through deadpan narration. Early on we are told not to pay attention to his current wife because even though she comes off nice, to him she's just this thing to express his discomfort on top of. He seems like a dick out of the gate, but it works on paper as the story with the main ex-girlfriend, Electra, is retroactively revealed, giving it structure.But the whole thing fails, for two reasons mainly. The first is the acting is terrible, there's no way around it. I should've seen it coming since these actors were basically pulled out of the ether. Our unlikable protagonist and his poker-faced foreign stereotype of a girlfriend give each other pleasure for minutes on end yet can't deliver the drama that the project requires to come afloat. And intending to justify the purpose of the movie, since the acting isn't going to be it, Noé puts not one but TWO different scenes in which the protagonist, a young aspiring director who wants to make a movie about sex, talks about how porn actors are ""unafraid"". Humph. That's the second problem: there's a constant insecure need of re-assuring that the sex is justified. Either shut up or don't do it.I'm putting aside that the dude filmed and released this in 3D. Now that's having a sense of humor. Ultimately, a movie that nobody really will want to experience other than alone, doesn't need any silly alterations of the sort, as they seem to represent the creator rubbing his rebellion in your uninterested face. Noé's self-indulgence is inevitable, and it doesn't help that he appears in the movie as a character named ""Noé"", and the protagonist's baby is called ""Gaspar"".What else then? It has good music. Especially that Pink Floyd needle drop. Also the movie seems like it's going to be about drugs. It features few scenes in which Electra is dealing with it in any real sense but the fact that she's missing by the end and never revealed to be found might be going in that direction. That doesn't justify that scene with her mother though, that comes out of nowhere, signifies nothing, and isn't worth a lot considering, well, the B-grade acting, that eventually is the nail in the coffin of this film, and in fact any type of film like this, the reason why it's not taken as seriously as it wants to be taken: it makes us ask, Is it because no respectable actor would do this? Isn't it just looking for excuses to shoot explicit scenes?Some jealousy and infidelity are depicted, and the desire of the protagonists to be ""big artists"", which is cheesy as hell, even though it's only mentioned once or twice. It's all very near-sighted, so the plot goes back to sex because it's the only thing that it can claim as boundary-pushing. I appreciate that the characters use protection consistently. Unlike many Hollywood movies, it adds to the overall realism.The movie ends in this weird middle-of-the-road of not knowing if something really serious has happened or if it's just the paranoia of an unhealthy boyfriend/husband. It's in bad taste to make him hug his naked son in the final scene. Even if nudity has been considered to be a naturalistic and sometimes even Biblical way of storytelling, which is probably what intends to be here (making it the most pretentious moment in the entire movie), it doesn't pair well with the fact that the entire movie up to this point has used nudity to show sexual acts almost exclusively. I assume that the point of the film is that he's not gonna kill himself because of his son. Does that explanation save this movie? No, it's lacking all around. And it's a weird thing to end on regardless.",Love
96,dfjwebdesign,I'm surprised by the poor reception,9,26 August 2021,"If you're a Gaspar Noe fan, this movie is relatively tame in comparison to his other work. And I could see maybe docking it for being in English, which does feel more like an attempt to gain a more American audience that aren't often into foreign films. And perhaps those two things combined can make fans of his feel like this film is less authentic than Enter The Void, I Stand Alone, or Climax.But I don't feel that way. This is a simple, beautiful, raw film about relationships. More specifically how in life we often don't get what we want, or at least for one reason or another, settle for less. It's not a happy film about love. It's a film about falling in love, and discovering what love is versus lust. Or is love anything more than desire in disguise?Noe explores these themes in a story of a couple who have a threesome with their attractive female neighbor. Then, foolishly, the neighbor and man have an affair without the girlfriend, and the neighbor girl becomes pregnant. The movie jumps around in time, showing us both relationships before, during and after the affair. Noe, being an experimental director, doesn't simply play with nonlinear storytelling. All the sex in the movie is real, never simulated.I enjoy this film, and as it's probably his most commercially acceptable film, I think it's a great place to start if you've never watched one of Noe's films before. It's not as gritty-indie-flick as I Stand Alone, or as high art as Enter The Void, or as experimental as Irreversible or Climax. It's a great character study, not on the characters on screen, but of human interaction. It's beautiful and ugly, exciting and dull, colorful and drab. It explores the spectrum of what I would call and average relationship (at least when you're young). It's not about story, it's about people.Personally it's one of my favorites he's made, and I'm really surprised it's so 50/50 for people.",Love

It shows how 2 people. Alex and Murphy, both in search to do something meaningful in life meet fall in love, have a fleeting moment where they get to live their fantasies. The movie is a kind of storytelling of a bit older Alex , now entangled with family life, has a sporadic comeback of memories of his former love Electra. The moments they spent together, and how their fantasies ultimately led to their separation. This movie is a love-story, kind of , with all the materialistic, worldly pleasures, and emotions encompassing it. Worth a watch.

100,david-2011,"Love and lust, decline and fall",8,6 November 2015,"Mild plot spoiler (and like any Noe movie I think you ought to just ignore any synopses or reviews and simply see it for yourself): this is the story of two lovers, how they meet, how their romance develops, how they learn about each others desires, their past relationships. Sex is a drug, and these characters are junkies. The first hit draws them in, and as they chase the dragon with each other, trying to make each hit as momentous as the last, their relationship evolves, blossoms, and suffers. The movie, set in Paris, moves non-chronologically through Murphy's (an American film student) recollection of his relationship with Electra, a French artist, both of them in their early or mid-20s. Scenes are strung together like jumbled photographs, pieces of each recalling or referencing another memory. The film is told from Murphy's point of view, and yet he's not a completely likable character, displaying huge streaks of jealousy and hypocrisy. Electra is mysterious at first, then we learn more as we go deeper into Murphy's memory.This is a visually beautiful movie. The lighting is dark but expressive, the framing of the scenes is exquisite, and scenes cut in and out like the blink of an eye. The opening scene is bold and erotic, but at the same time, tender and intimate. There is a lot of sex in this movie, but it's not there to be gratuitous. Each sex scene is different, portraying the desires and moods of the characters involved. Like many of Noe's movies an underlying theme is that of a stranger in a strange land. In Enter the Void, the characters are Americans in Tokyo. Here of course Murphy is struggling with his ability to handle a relationship with a French woman with more open ideas of commitment. It's not absolute though; her world is changed too by Murphy's interpretation of the very fluidity she seems to be encouraging. A particularly poignant part of of the movie has a sympathetic French policeman lecturing the hot-headed American Murphy on his aggressive and destructive attitudes about sex and relationships. At this point the officer is voicing a key part of what I think Noe's philosophy about love and sex. Murphy and Electra decide to take the officer's advice, but it doesn't quite work out as planned, and it's seems like Noe is saying, ""here is how I think it ought to be, and yet I could still be wrong.""At one point, Murphy asks a character what the best thing in life is, and the response without hesitation, is ""Love."" He follows up by asking what the second is. And without hesitation, the answer is, ""sex."" This movie is about love and sex, how they influence one another, and how they can destroy one another. There's a sense of humor running through the movie, which is expressed in several mild in- jokes about the director, and one particularly shocking (yet delightful: the audience at the screening I sat in erupted into happy cheers) use of 3D. It's not a movie for everyone, nevertheless it is quite a movie.",Love

All the more reason to be surprised at how moving, tender and beautiful this film turned out to be. Why such outrage in the reviews is beyond my understanding, - is the sight of two (or three:) people making love is that offensive? Are these people plan on never having sex? Obviously they never seen any porn, if they calling this movie porn! ""Love"" is a meditation on physical intimacy, with beautiful cinematography, mesmerizing soundtrack and hypnotic performance by Aomi Muyock, that is certainly worth watching and does not deserve the low rating it has on IMDB. I personally was really touched by the use of Erik Satie's ""Gnossiennes"" throughout the film, as it's one of my favorite pieces of music, and I always felt there's a flair of understated sensuality about them.

110,zupapazupap,As thought provoking and stylish as you'd expect,7,27 December 2015,"As thought provoking and stylish as you'd expect. Kind of like a hybrid of Enter the Void, Nymphomaniac, The Lobster and Weekend. You can feel the love that has gone into this film.The sex is both beautiful and ugly. It's not porn, more like an aestheticized version of somebody's personal sex tape, but one designed to provoke contemplation more than any other response. To feel any more real it would need to be in the style of a documentary, which would have the effect of distancing you from the characters. I didn't feel like I was experiencing the story directly (as I do with good suspense movies), but I did want things to work out well for the characters. If you judge a movie by how much the pacing and suspense immerses you, you won't enjoy Love. If you can be immersed into a movie's atmosphere and want something to feed your imagination, then you will get a lot from it.A lot of reviews and comments on IMDb seem to say it is not a thought provoking movie, or that it is pretentious, yet the poster was moved to write about their thoughts on it, so it certainly isn't empty. I found talking about it can result in the conversation going to some very interesting places.It has earned a place in the history of cinema, and is hopefully a step away from the feelings of shame people feel about sex, a step towards greater freedom in art, culture and cinema.",Love

The main female lead, Electra, outshone her male co-star to the point where I was left thinking ""Why so much trouble for this guy?"". His acting felt forced, hollow, just...uninteresting. I actually think the movie could have even lost a bunch of dialogue and would have been better...because the photography, cinematography, music and editing was actually quite cool and kept it feeling alive...where the script was so poor that it made me laugh at moments which I'm guessing was not the intention:)Anyway, I'd say worth checking out/experiencing, if only for the super hot sex scenes that make up about 50% of the movie!",Love

How far was that from the truth.Love in 3d, which is the title the film had in Mexico, is a tedious, unnecessarily long film that has no real story, statement or message.Its a long porn video with a bad script. The film is supposed to pose a question about what love is, but never really addresses it or takes any kind of position about it. Furthermore, it extends its scenes way past it should. The ending sequences, for example, are just endless quasi-reiterations of the previous scenes that add nothing to the film. You think it is over, and boom! another sex sequence, and then another and another. The ""cuts"" the film uses are also poorly executed. I understand using the cuts for when you jump in time between the scenes but if you do not, why do you still use it? Half of the time the cuts are used, the movie does jump in time,but the other half is just an annoying blink of the screen to come back to exactly the same point.If this had been a 15 minute short then it might actually had made sense, but a 2 and a half hour long movie was definitely way more than a stretch.

In instances where the wig cannot cover, the usual tricks of head, hand, shoulder and camera angle are used. Since this is essentially a XXX movie, I have no idea why they insisted upon not showing any female genitalia. I guess it is just that the French movie makers are just as sexist as those in the USA. Whether that sexism is driven by a the old fashioned belief that women's genitals are GROSS (which they aren't) or that women should have sexual privacy that men don't deserve.

121,andreiamarianaf,Noé brings us this couple that can't take all the sentiment inside and so has to pour it out skin on skin.,9,30 December 2015,"Love is a film representing Murphy's (the main character) trip to the past when he finds out his ex-girlfriend, Electra, is missing. As Murphy, a young man who is studying cinema in Paris, says in the film, his ""biggest dream is to make a movie that truly depicts sentimental sexuality"". Whether this character has some biographical connection with Gaspar himself or not, is something discussable, but his statement is undoubtedly related to Love. Some might say Love is a romanticised porno, with unnecessary shots and scenes which only purpose is to make it even more controversial than it would have already been without them. It is not a lie that Noé chose several provocative shots with explicit sexuality, and decided not to show the awkwardness of sex. Some say Love does not represent what sex really is about because of omitting that. However, if the point of the film is to ""depict sentimental sexuality"", if the title itself is summing up the whole point of the plot, is it really necessary that we see this couple literally cleaning up their mess, or going through the process of getting it right physically? Of course, if that's not important to Gaspar Noé, so shouldn't be most of the, as many say, cheap close- ups. The question is: if we all know what happens after sex, and we also know what happens during sex, what was Noé's intention? What is it that distinguishes Love from a regular porn when it comes to sex scenes? I believe that if Gaspar had represented the triviality of sex, most people would finally agree he did something completely different from the banality of most drama films related to love issues, and that he got the pornographic part to work perfectly because it represented sex exactly as it is. I also believe that these people are the ones mistaking Noé's goal. Let me break this to you: Love is not a porno; not because it didn't turn out like one after editing, but because it wasn't made to be one. Love is a drama, and what the film is trying to represent is love in sex. As Murphy claims, ""() sex while you're in love. That's the best thing."". Right from the open scene, we are engaged in an intimate moment between this couple we don't know. We even get the feeling that the scene is going to end at any moment, because that's what usually happens. We don't know if they're in love, we don't know who they are, and we don't know what's happening to them. All we know is that there stand two relaxed people, enjoying each other calmly, and we can feel the love right away. Sex is the ultimate vehicle of transmission of love. The magnum opus of human interaction. Noé knows this, and he brings us this couple that can't take all the sentiment inside and so has to pour it out skin on skin. It was necessary that the film was as explicit and real as possible, so it could ascend to its own purposes (and expectations, too). Because if you want to do something different, you can't imitate what's been done, you can't imitate art, you got to imitate life. But if on the one hand Gaspar managed to create something entirely new, he also stepped on ordinary themes such as drugs, adultery and even violence. Once they put drugs on films, we know something's about to go down. Following the first scenes involving narcotics, we're presented with moments where Murphy and Electra try to elevate their sexual experiences to a whole new level and experiment all kinds of different stuff. Which, if I may say, doesn't exactly pleases Murphy. It is also likely that viewers will question the existence of love between the main characters since they cheat on each other several times, but it seems that what Gaspar was trying to do was to demonstrate how desire and love can work separately. While discussing the cheating part of the film with a friend, I was given a whole new perspective that I hadn't honestly thought of before that. The truly and real betrayal happened when Murphy gave Omi the baby that was meant to be given to Electra. Throughout the film, there are an extraordinary number of almost idyllic conversations about babies. Murphy says they did everything together, except for making a baby. They even picked out names for this imaginary child that never existed. It was like they had built a dream together and Murphy gave it away to someone else. That was something Electra couldn't forgive, and that was what killed her. Of course, Murphy ended up paying for what he'd done, broken and lost in memories of a love(r) long gone, and the moment of acceptance comes when he's desperately asking God for a second chance and for Electra's safety, while recalling the beginning of their relationship. I think everyone expected Love to be a soft-porn, something light in terms of emotion and heavy in terms of sex. Some actually see it that way, and most don't have enough sensibility to feel the deep complex plot. Love flows sweetly and gently, violently and roughly. But in the end, we feel it all.",Love
122,petitemannequins,"Beautiful colors, photography and music",9,23 November 2015,"I waited a long time to see this movie and it totally fulfilled my expectations. Noe has done it again; not in a violent, kind of psychedelic way but he has beautifully showed us how deeply connected love and sex are. I felt totally identified with many parts of the movie; aggressive after-fight sex, promises of eternal loyalty, that dreamy state of mind that we are put on when we fall in love. I strongly believe a director can transmit a message without giving us the whole scenario. We don't know much about the main character's lives, but I felt like it wasn't necessary at all. What Noe accomplished to show us are those profound feelings of despair, need, violence, tenderness and connection with another person. The photography is excellent, the colors are so beautiful and the music so well chosen (and, a very important fact, selected/composed by John Carpenter) that in many scenes that show explicit sex you get both aroused and amazed.

Sex scenes were the only good thing about the movie, everything else was pretty miserable and I'm giving it 4 stars only because I support the thought that threesome often ruins relationships. One should have that with a total stranger on a vacation - no names, no contacts, no strings.

I feel like anyone that has been through an intense relationship ends up completely crushed after this movie, not because it's sad, but because it represents LOVE so well. We are so used to the mainstream presentation of couples in movies and Love completely defies that concept. As with any Gaspar Noe movie, it touches you in a very personal way and leaves you with a nostalgic feeling. 100% recommend this movie.

And yes, during certain scenes people got up and left. Yet. The film doesn't argue to be anything beyond a meandering stroll into the gallows melancholy. And it does this very very well. The film features no highbrow intellectual conversations but instead, favors the same lines you've probably slung at your lovers. Again and again and again. Just like the sex you've had with your lovers again and again and again. You know their bodies and you know how to please them and above all, you know how to hurt them. Sorrow. There's a resplendent simplicity here that hypnotizes the viewer.You hear music banging inside the club, yet the lovers are outside in halflight. Having sex, obviously. This is a good image of what this film surprisingly achieves best: intimacy. And it fights for that with it's magnificent camera-work and editing.But what would this review be if it didn't talk about the 3D sex? Love and cinema are inseparable. Love stories are why you stick glued to a chair for a couple of hours. Raw sex is part of love, yet, films used to cut to birds necking after a kiss. Then it became steamy windows. Signs, metaphors, analogies, semiotic nausea. And here, Noé takes that away which makes the film even coarser, and ultimately more brutal.I wanted to write this review because the whole marketing (""finally a love story restricted for -16) and shock value (an eye-rolling warning in the opening credits) have cheapened what this film has achieved and I encourage viewers to look beyond.",Love

At first I was aroused from the raw gritty sex scenes that I have found myself in through out the many relationships of my time.
The voice over being in Murphys head, why am I hearing his thoughts? I asked but then I suddenly realized why because we as humans want to love and in loving comes losing. Either it be a young first lovers quarrel or the one that got away we often find ourselves asking what if.What Love the film did was bring us back into that which made it all too real and sometimes painful to watch not to any fault of the film in fact the exact opposite. The symbol of an added spice to brighten a flickering dwindling flame that we want with all of our soul to stay burning bright. That added spice being what extinguished the flame all together tells us not only as viewers of this film but as humans to be weary of just how fast the fuel burns out because once its all turned to ash there is nothing left to build with.There are undoubtedly better films out there than this but once you look past the sex and see the real life in this story it is then you will see yourself in the shower crying as the world feels like it is crashing down on top of your back with all of its weight.

'Love' is so explicit because it wants you to actually feel the relationship between its main characters. Also, the camera angle and what it focuses on shows so much more than the superficiality of what porn shows. This movie wants its audience to understand how a couple become so codependent from each other in order for them to feel fullfilled. You can actually see the transformation of their relationship in their sex acts, how at the beginning it's more tender in comparison with the aggressiveness that it is at the end of their relationship.

Many of these practices are shown in graphic detail.All the sex is un-simulated (meaning the sex is really happening).In one scene two females and one male engage in a threesome.An erect penis is shown many times throughout the film.Two or three times an ejaculation is shown, including one scene where a woman's hand is scene masturbating an erect male penis (which is the only thing on screen), before the male ejaculates directly at the camera lens.Quite a lot of sexually-related talks throughout.So what could possibly be the reason for this except that it was made for gay men and straight women. The Double Standard is alive and well, even in NC-17 and NR and unrated movies.If anyone has a clue as to why it was done this way, please respond.",Love
138,Drixsis,Filmmaking at its worse,1,18 September 2015,"There's a point when the main character and voice-over narrator on Love says that he never sees a movie presenting ""emotional sexuality"". Sex, semen and blood, that's what people would like to see. Murphy is a filmmaker, or so he says. Actually, I think he is just a puppet to Gaspar Noé intents in this too stereotyped film that had the big ambition to be innovative.Love has been creating some noisy around the world, and has been like that since its premiere during Cannes. Explicit sex and love scenes on 3D, that is how the movie has been known mostly. Despite the bad reviews, I thought it would be at least interesting. It wasn't, at all.Before the first scene, there's a sign announcing the moment to put the 3D glasses on. And so the terrible nonsense begins. At the very begin I've already realized this movie is just noisy. The sex is explicit and so, so boring, that I was begging to the characters to finish their business as soon as possible. What was announced as innovative, is just a bunch of clichés put together. It is filmmaking in its worse. Gaspar Noe thinks he knows so much, and that he is above the other mere mortals. His condescending arrogance is staggering, actually. I imagine him thinking: this world is so mediocre, full of prude hypocrites, I'll show them how it's done and make a movie about excruciating love and sex. So he started to write it and finally realized it wouldn't be so easy. To talk about life, and love, and sex it is necessary to be really alive, and not just criticizing the other's ways from outside. Unable to write a true love sexy story, he decided then to check every box that came to his mind relating to sex: explicit scenes, close on dicks, threesome, sex clubs, homosexual sex, trannies, public sex and so on. As if a close on a ejaculating dick would be the quintessence of a revolutionary speech. There's a bunch of unrelated scenes, as if the awful voice-over could succeed in giving them some meaning. An example: at one scene, the couple are lying on bed after sex, and from nothing, the guy asks the girl about her biggest fantasy. Sexual? she replies. Of course, he says. And she tells him how that she would like have sex with him and a third woman, a blond with blue eyes. The next day or so, they are getting their mail when they meet the new neighbor: a sixteen blue eyed blond that are living next door. After the badly filmed threesome, the guy says: thanks for Europe! (a place where eh would have a three way sex with a minor). Did you get the image? So.Gaspar Noé, by his main character, affirms that there's not sexual love stories on the screen. I think he never saw any of Bernardo Bertolucci's movies. Or the Spanish/French production Sex and Lucía, a beautiful story about love with stunning and heartfelt sex scenes (Paz Vega is incredible). Or even Betty Blue, for everybody's sake. Or even 9 Songs - even with all the bad reviews, this one is actually honest. Sorry the rage, but it is inevitable. Noé should look better around him, or, even better, he should head to the DVD section on a store and just see how wrong he is. I've read how the acting here is terrible, and it is a fact. The actors are not even able to walk naturally (it is so staged that hurts), let alone show deep feelings or have real sex. And despite what has been said, I don't think it is difficult to find good actors that would accept to be a part of this project if it was a good one. At least his protagonist should have been more endearing - even if I'm not sure that it would have saved this doomed story anyway. Because the problem here is not just the bad acting, the lousy dialogues, the incredibly lousy and staged sex scenes. The main trouble in this movie is the sexist, arrogant, wrongful view about the world and people. And when a filmmaker start this way, there's nothing that can save him from the impending doom. People were leaving the theater constantly, they were dropping like flies. However, rather than doing that by how explicit the sex is, I think people did leave for the sole reason of how bad is this movie. It's unbearable in fact. And we see no end to it, two hours and fifteen minutes of sheer bad filmmaking. Not could be more far from deep emotion, an intense love story and visceral sex.

139,drewm-72229,Hottest sex scenes in a film I've seen,10,2 August 2015,"Contains some of the hottest sex scenes ever filmed, thanks to the combination of plausible courtship scenes, character development, and graphic (at least partially non-simulated) sex. Many of the sex scenes are beautiful to the point you become aware of the cinematography, though I did not feel aware of the acting at any point. A lot of the melodrama could have been edited out without impacting the plot whatsoever, not to mention some parts that are downright abusive to the viewer with blinding flashing lights, and, I suspect, some cheap abuse of 3D effects (I saw it in 2D), but then again this movie probably couldn't exist without giving the director a ton of editorial freedom. IMHO this is a must-see if you care at all about eroticism in film.",Love

141,radiantcity,Self-Indulgent Melodrama,2,28 October 2015,"No one was able to walk out of the theater this evening as the director Gaspar Noe was in the audience. I'm certain he took note of folks laughing at scenes meant to have profound emotional impact, like the entire ending. Little character development with the main character's 17 yr old wife, or 18, they had sex when she was 16, nothing more than a prop. Their child, the unintended creation of a broken condom, is named ""Gaspar"". The wife is an orphan of sorts, unwanted by her mother but somehow has the cash and wherewithall to rent an apt in Paris and do nothing more than go clubbing, listen to her iPod and bang strangers. Profoundly self-indulgent about lost love, but hard to take seriously when the lost love happens between supposed college students (we never see the college, college books or a single classmate) living and partying in Paris, none of whom even are even remotely worth caring about. Except perhaps the teenage wife, after she gives birth, but again her only role is to get banged, have a kid and though otherwise absolutely gorgeous, kind and loving as only a supermodel with minimal lines can be, this one only serves to annoy the hell out of the main character. Reminded me of Brown Bunny, but that was a film with guts. This is just an excuse to film cumshots in 3D, wrapped around a plot that never went anywhere with no sense of finality or a hint of revelation or completion. In fact, the movie had to flash a massive THE END for the audience to know the film was over.",Love
142,johnyjacques,Beautifully done,9,24 November 2015,"Now most people will not like this movie and I totally get it. I am fortunate enough to have seen it in 3D which I truly enjoyed dodging seaman was quite interesting. But for me this movie was excellent. The cast and acting was absolutely delicious. Like the Noe films I've seen, there are some great artistic shots and uncomfortable moments but I went in with those expectations and part of the joy is seeing how much you can endure watching. For me, what really caught my attention was the lead actor's emotional acting around heartbreak and regret, I know that feeling and I can almost feel his pain...the sex scenes become secondary after a while if you can find yourself connecting to the emotions of the story...and if you've watched enough unsimulated sex in film as I have, it actually isn't quite a big deal. I think Noe did make it his purpose to oversexualize the film a bit which at some points I found unnecessary but all and all, excellent film and just as good if not better then Irreversible",Love
143,paulabjork,"Amazing, never seen anything like this before",10,14 February 2016,"This might be the only movie that shows real intimacy and real love on the screen.It felt like being in someone, listening to him talk to himself. Just like I talk to myself. It felt very satisfying seeing the world trough someone else's eyes. It was very easy to not judge him because i became the head character. I feel it, the feeling of new-love as we say in Sweden. That strong feeling stayed inside me throughout the evening after watching this. That exact feeling you have when everything is crazy and your feelings are so strong. When you can move mountains with the love that fills up your chest. That anything is possible if you just have that other person by your side. And the sex is a very big part of telling this story truthfully.",Love
144,annijsen,intense feelings on the big screen,8,19 March 2016,"The way they put these deep feelings of love and intense relationship on the screen, is very well done. I can very much relate to a big part of the story. There were maybe too many sex scenes but actually, most of them were very real to me. There could have maybe some more details of the individuals' life (school, work, friends), but at the same time it keeps very much focused on the intensity of the couples relationship, which makes you live their story together with them. The film could have been a bit shorter (cut some sex scenes). But overall, it's a very moving film, it will stay with me for a while. A kind of love like this one is real (I confirm for all the haters out there)!",Love
145,mrsalee,Way too much sex,3,29 June 2020,There's so much sex that it starts to distract from the plot. I wanted to know what happened to Electra but midway I stopped caring when the relationship became sexual napalm.,Love
146,haahaham,bad,1,6 March 2017,"Bad movie, I never in my life wished a movie to be finish as this one! I don't get it, is this suppose to be a sex porn movie? because if it is, it did poorly and some of the porn maker do a way better job for making sex scene . So what the movie is about again? the story? the plot? the over all movie sucked so bad.Completely waste of time, if I want ""sex, semen, love"" I'll go and rent some porn which is done more professionally.",Love
147,thermodynamx,porn trying to be artsy,2,3 January 2018,"And failing miserably. 
So, I saw Gaspar Noe's newest film last night. I'm a fan of his work and can see why people question his ability. If you haven't seen it and do not want the film spoiled then stop reading. Anyways, what did I just watch? It was great don't get me wrong, but I feel like there's a fine line between film sex scenes and just straight porn.",Love
