0,TheLittleSongbird,"Less than legendary, still better than expected",6,1 July 2017,"'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword' left me somewhat on the fence. It is much better than some critics have said, being nowhere near among the worst films seen so far this year, but it to me doesn't quite warrant the vehement defence it's garnered too.Guy Ritchie's best? Not by a long shot. His worst? Nowhere near, nothing is worse than 'Swept Away'. 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword' could have been much better but it's hardly a film with no redeeming qualities and there are far worse films around. Then again this is coming from somebody who tries to observe and talk about redeeming qualities even in really bad films (for instance 1 and 2 out of 10 ratings are pretty rare, and am generally giving out 10/10s a little less).There are strengths with 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword'. The costumes, scenery and production design are pretty audacious while never having a fake or too clean look, one does get sucked into the atmosphere and setting of the film and can feel the authenticity. The rousing, rich in energy and thrilling music score is a strong contender for the film's best asset.Some nice humorous lines, some exciting and innovatively choreographed action and a mix of coarse realism and a mythic touch are further things to like. The story is never dull, actually mostly having a vibrant energy, as such and is just about easy to follow if not perfect in execution, do admire it though for putting a new spin on a timeless but old story sometimes in need of more freshness when adapted.Charlie Hunnam has an easy-going and steely charisma in the title role, and he is perfectly matched by dignified Dijimon Hounsou and particularly a sinister but surprisingly rootable Jude Law as the villain of the piece.However, Ritchie's direction has a tendency to be chaotic and overdone, while the shaky camera work is some of the most excessive of any film to use it seen recently and the editing has an awkward jerkiness that can feel nauseating. Special effects are a mixed bag, some are good, others are very artificial looking and reminiscent of a low-budget video game.While there are good performances here, Astrid Bergès-Frisbey is pretty wasted in an underwritten role and David Beckham is dreadfully out of place with his amateurish acting standing out like a sore thumb. Generally the characters could have been better written, some needed more development and others needed their motivations expanded upon and made much clearer (particularly the titular character). The most interesting in fact is Vortigen.Parts of the story do work well, but there are other times where the pacing could have slowed down and that there could have been less going on, some of it felt too frenetic and bloated.In conclusion, better than expected but less than legendary. 6/10 Bethany Cox",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1,bkoganbing,A medieval Oliver Twist,6,22 August 2017,"The legend of King Arthur gets a more urban look to it in this latest version of the Arthurian legend from Guy Ritchie. Charlie Hunnam plays the young king who yanks that sword from the stone and lays claim to his father's thrown.Arthur looks more like the artful dodger in a childhood where he was raised in a brothel by some most patriotic prostitutes in the ancient city of Londinium. Who's running things now is Jude Law playing the wicked king Vortigern. To keep power Law dabbles in the black magical arts. That in itself will generate the fact that this film will abound with special effects which it does.Nice for the younger generation, but I still prefer both Mel Ferrer and Brian Aherne as King Arthur.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
2,Leofwine_draca,A real mess,3,6 June 2019,"KING ARTHUR: LEGEND OF THE SWORD is another example of Hollywood's modern obsession with CGI-enhanced action spectacle, forgetting in the meantime to include anything like narrative coherence, character depth, the usual staples of filmmaking. This one starts off with big, brawling, random fantasy sequence, but who cares when you don't know the characters or indeed know what's going on?After lots of stylistic nonsense - Guy Ritchie's glory days are long in the distant past - we join up with a Robin Hood-style Charlie Hunnam, a Cockney geezer replete with silly dialogue and tough guy posturing. He fights against evil Jude Law in a series of sprawling action set-pieces, occasionally featuring solid choreography but all too often reduced to lame CGI effects for no reason. The writing is paper thin, the story a mere mish-mash of fantasy tropes from LORD OF THE RINGS and GAME OF THRONES with no realism whatsoever, and it still goes on an hour too long.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
3,SnoopyStyle,interested but never satisfied,5,31 December 2017,"Uther, King of Camelot, is betrayed by his brother Vortigern (Jude Law). Uther's baby son is found floating down the river in Londinium. Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) grows up to run a brothel gaining the loyalty of his people. He is brought, as many others, to pull Excalibur from the stone. After doing so, he is declared the born king and Vortigern intends to publicly kill him. A ragtag group of fighters saves him from the execution and starts a rebellion.While the legend of King Arthur is well known, each iteration still needs to present the world it represents. Guy Ritchie's disjointed style of moviemaking makes it harder to follow. The basic good guys and bad guys are easily comprehended but everything else is a dark muddle. There is no doubt that Ritchie's skills make some very compelling scenes. I still love some of the gangster banter. He may be trying too hard to excel in the age of big CGI action. At a certain point, it's just a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. I'm interested for the most part but was never satisfied.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
4,Prismark10,Last knight,4,3 February 2018,"The thing about the legendary tales of King Arthur is that they were a fun read when you were a kid. Turning the myth into films requires reimagination. I think Guy Ritchie has failed here and what we have is an expensive CGI laden folly with a bland actor.Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) was raised in a brothel, thrived in the streets where he learned how to steal and to fight. Posh boy Ritchie likes a bit of rough. After all he did marry Madonna.One day Arthur skips the line and pulls a mystical sword from the stone. However this was a sly ruse by King Vortigern (Jude Law) who wants to smoke out his brother's (Eric Bana) offspring. Vortigern had killed his brother and stolen the throne by making a pact with a dark evil force which seems to be a giant human hybrid octopus.Now I admire a fresh spin to the Arthurian legend but I did not have The Lion King in mind mixed with Tolkien, Gladiator and Games of Thrones. Then there is the trademark Guy Ritchie cockney gangster edits.The film started out well with giant elephants, epic battles but then the story kicked in and Charlie Hunnam turned up.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
5,claudio_carvalho,Deconstruction and Reinvention of a Legend,6,30 July 2017,"The legend of King Arthur and Excalibur has been been told many times by the cinema and television. John Boorman's ""Excalibur"" and Walt Disney ""The Sword in the Stone"" are certainly among my favorite versions of this legend. The versions that I have seen have different stories but the storyline are similar; therefore, most of the worldwide viewers have a similar view of King Arthur and Excalibur. Guy Ritchie has decided to deconstruct and reinvent the legend using an unpleasant character and based on CGI in most of the scenes. The result entertains as an adventure especially for young generations that like special effects. However it is absolutely frustrating for those that are familiar with the legend and that likes cinema as something more than CGIs. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Rei Arthur: A Lenda da Espada"" (""King Arthur: The Legend of the Sword"")",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
6,nogodnomasters,"What do you mean when you say, ""Take the castle?""",8,3 July 2017,"This is the story of Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) from childhood to becoming King. Arthur was raised in a brothel and becomes streetwise, something that never played back into the story. His companions in arms come from both Asia and Africa...was that a West African accent? There is also a French accent mage (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey) who Arthur looks on more as a muse. If you are a purist for the book, forget this film. Guy Ritchie attempts to make this film an epic similar to what Peter Jackson did to LOTR complete with an evil mage tower and oliphaunts.The soundtrack was fairly good, when present. The plot could have used a tweak. The whole Darkland thing didn't work other than to spend CG dollars. We see Arthur and his group as rebels. The dialogue wasn't bad, but the delivery was awful. Charlie Hunnam was boring as Arthur. Jude law as his antagonist wasn't much better. They were miscast...oh not John Wayne as Genghis Khan miscast but more like Russell Crowe as Police Inspector Javert miscast. The supporting roles weren't well developed and could of helped out...the way they helped out Elijah Wood as Frodo. Big on graphics and style, substance needed improvement.Guide: 1 F-word.

7,kosmasp,Sons of Knighthood,6,1 September 2017,"It also could have been named: King Arthur rises. This is the making of a king or how the guy formerly known to be a son of Anarchy, now be a son of a King. It does make sense and many will argue that he has the charisma to carry the role. I mean just looking at the rating at this moment (many months after this made it into cinemas), a 7.0 is very high and speaks of people being generally entertained.And I do believe you can make that argument, especially if you don't hold this up to previous movies or want it to be classic. Box office on the other hand suggest otherwise. I do believe the release date/timing was chosen badly. The movie itself while entertaining has its flaws too (especially one almost completely anticlimactic end, which seems to easy and convenient). But if you like Guy Ritchie and the way he handles things, you won't really be disappointed ...",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
8,lee_eisenberg,"Percy Fawcett, Cinque, Petyr Baelish, Hulk and Watson meet in a weak setting",2,5 January 2018,"Guy Ritchie impressed audiences everywhere with his looks at organized crime in England (Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch). After faltering with the ""Swept Away"" remake, he rebounded with ""Revolver"", ""Sherlock Holmes"" and its sequel. Now he falters again. His ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" tries to be ""Game of Thrones"" meets every Bruce Lee movie. What results is two hours of head-banging action and over-the-top CGI so pumped up that it seems like a sick joke. I haven't actually read any of the Arthurian legends, but I doubt that they were this brainless.A completely wasted effort.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

10,CinemaSerf,Aim low and you wont be disappointed...,6,1 December 2019,"All we needed here was Craig Kelly and we could have an Arthurian version of ""Queer as Folk"". This isn't anywhere near a bad as I thought it would be. Charlie Hunnam carries off his role as Arthur with his tongue in his cheek. Djimon Hounsou and a slightly wooden Jude Law enter into the spirit of this fantasy adventure too. There are plenty of mythical beasties to keep the animators (and us) happy and the production standards are high. Sure, the script could probably be salvaged by an eight year old but hell, it's meant to be enjoyed. I took it on face value and it did ok.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
11,zardoz-13,"A Different Kind of ""King Arthur""",10,26 May 2017,"Hollywood must constantly reinvent old yarns to make them relevant for contemporary audiences. ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" director Guy Ritchie embraces this strategy with his spectacular, $175-million, sword & sorcery saga ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,"" starring ""Sons of Anarchy's"" Charlie Hunnam as the title character. Unmistakably inspired by the popular HBO series ""Game of Thrones,"" Ritchie and scenarists Joby Harold of ""Awake"" and Lionel Wigram of ""Sherlock Holmes,"" adapting a story by Harold and ""Jack the Giant Slayer's"" David Dobkin, have appropriated the venerable legend and accentuated its far-fetched fantasy elements. If you're expecting either a rehash of John Boorman's splendid ""Excalibur"" (1981) or Antoine Fuqua's ""King Arthur"" (2004) with Clive Owen and Keira Knightley, the provocative departures Ritchie and company have taken may alienate you. Anybody expecting Ritchie's ""King Arthur"" will stick to the legends may feel disgruntled by this two-hour plus, PG-13 swashbuckler. Since its release, ""King Arthur"" has proved not what most audiences either sought or expected, and the Warner Brothers release has been branded a disaster considering its miserable $15-million opening. Nevertheless, ""King Arthur: The Legend of the Sword"" qualifies as a terrific tale with stupendous CGI and ranks as the best version of the myth to grace screens since ""Excalibur."" Mind you, ""King Arthur"" concerns itself more with the eponymous hero's revenge against his repellent uncle than a romantic escapade like the Sean Connery & Richard Gere version ""First Knight"" (1995) where the two fought over Guinevere. At the same time, ""King Arthur"" utilizes the familiar tropes of most Arthurian epics, but deploys them in ways both unusual and refreshing.""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" opens with a prologue which states that mage (magicians) and man no longer live in harmony. The wicked warlock Mordred (Rob Knighton of ""All Things to Men"") storms Uther Pendragon's (Eric Bana of ""Hulk"") kingdom with three gargantuan pachyderms—bigger than any you've seen--to destroy it. These pachyderms have wrecking balls attached to their trunks, and they shatter the stone masonry as if it were made from papier mâché. These rampaging beasts smash Camelot's walls until Uther clambers aboard Mordred's elephant and apparently decapitates the malevolent mage. Temporarily, order appears restored, until Uther's deceitful brother, Vortigern (Jude Law of ""Gattaca""), forfeits his wife Elsa (Katie McGrath) to three evil sea-witches equipped with the tentacles of an octopus. He sacrifices Elsa so he can conjure up the Demon Knight to kill not only Uther, but also his wife in a larger-than-life clash. The Demon Knight resembles those armor-clad behemoths that artist Frank Frazetta once created for the classic Molly Hatchet album covers in the 1970s. Uther wields Excalibur against the enormous Demon Knight, but this monstrous fiend overwhelms him. Before he dies, Uther orders young Arthur to flee. Afterward, Uther hurls Excalibur aloft so that the sword turns somersaults in the air. As he falls to his knees, Uther turns into a stone, and Excalibur impales itself to the hilt between Uther's shoulder blades. Vortigern sloughs off the Demon Knight form he took on in the fight and watches as his elder brother—now a huge rock--plunges into the bay with Excalibur sticking out of the rock. Meantime, Uther's infant son Arthur is swept down river in a boat like the infant Moses and compassionate prostitutes take him in and raise the lad as if he belonged to them. At this point, Vortigern has practiced enough black magic to make himself invincible until he learns that Excalibur has reappeared. One day, the waters of the bay where Uther vanished with the sword in his back recede. Vortigern assembles young Englishman by the hundreds and ships them to the bay to see who can extract the sword from the stone. Eventually, Vortigern's dastardly henchmen capture Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) and he finds himself in front of Excalibur with no hope of pulling it out. Incredibly, Arthur draws the sword from the stone, but the sword delivers such a jolt to his system that our legendary hero drops it and collapses into an unconscious heap. Later, Vortigern converses privately with Arthur, and Arthur assures him he has no wish to wear a crown. Nevertheless, Vortigern plans to execute him in public. Happily, a miracle appears in the form of an anonymous Mage (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey of ""Julliette"") dispatched by Merlin. She visits one of Uther's former knights, Bedivere (Djimon Hounsou of ""Amistad""), and explains that his men and he must intervene before Vortigern can behead Arthur. The next time we see Arthur, he is kneeling at an altar awaiting the executioner's pleasure. The Mage conjures up supernatural elements that paralyze Vortigern, sends his knights scrambling to save him, while Bedivere's men rescue Arthur. Afterward, ""King Arthur"" depicts our hero's reluctance not only to take up Excalibur, but also to wield it to avenge the cold-blooded murder of his mother and father.Charlie Hunnam makes a charismatic Arthur. Indeed, compared with previous Arthurs, Hunnam could be hailed as 'the man who didn't want to be king,' such is his reluctance to brandish Excalibur and solidify England against its adversaries both within and without the kingdom. Director Guy Ritchie surrounds Hunnam with a thoroughly convincing cast, among them ""Game of Thrones'"" own Aidan Gillen. If you've seen either of Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" thrillers, you will savor his snappy editing style and the amusing way that he condenses expository dialogue sequences. At one point, the Mage sends our hero into the Dark Lands to learn about his past. Indeed, Arthur's past haunts him. Eventually, he musters enough nerve from the experience to confront his treacherous uncle. As the diabolical Vortigern, Jude Law indulges himself with an evil gleam in his eye, and his ominous henchmen in black armor are just as unsavory. Despite its two-hour plus running time, ""King Arthur"" maintains its momentum, and Ritchie orchestrates some truly impressive battle sequences with computer generated imagery that enhances the larger-than-life spectacle.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
12,grantss,"Superficial, style-over-substance version of the King Arthur legend",4,16 August 2018,"An alternative version of the King Arthur legend. As a boy, Arthur is left orphaned after his father, King Uther Pendragon, and mother are killed in a war waged against them by Vortigern, who then assumes the throne. Arthur flees and is raised in a brothel, knowing very little of his birthright. Vortigern wants Arthur dead, to ensure there is no claimant to the throne. The legends foretell that only the next king will be able to draw Excalibur, Uther's sword, from the rock where it is lodged. So, in an effort to identify Arthur, Vortigern forces all the young men of Arthur's age to attempt to draw out the sword. Now it is Arthur's turn.A fairly weak, dumbed-down, style-over-substance of the King Arthur legend. From the opening scenes you know this is going to more about special effects and over-the-top supernatural nonsense than good old-fashioned plot and character depth. The middle section isn't too bad, however, as this is where director Guy Ritchie plays to his strength. Here we see Arthur as a cocky, confident young entrepreneur / criminal. It was like an English gangster movie and reminded me of Ritchie's better works - 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch', just set in medieval times. The movie flowed well at this point, driven by the lightness and humour.Then it was back to CGI-saturated action scenes and more supernatural nonsense. Quite a disappointment after having some hope that this might be at least half-decent. For a far better, and still the most definitive, version of King Arthur, watch Excalibur (1981) instead.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

15,george.schmidt,Royale With Cheese,6,13 May 2017,"KING ARTHUR: LEGEND OF THE SWORD (2017) ** Charlie Hunnam, Astrid Berges-Frisbey, Jude Law, Djimon Hounsou, Eric Bana. Filmmaker Guy Ritchie's latest shake'n'bake remake of a literary classic comes rough and tumble ready for the most part in this retelling of the fabled tale of an heir to the throne of Camelot and prior to the Knights of The Round Table with hunky Hunnam as the titular young leader to be. While the film takes its liberties with a multitude of CGI WTFs (gigantic serpents and elephants to name a few) the screenplay by Ritchie, Lionel Wigram, Joby Harold and David Dobkin feels like a cobbled hodgepodge that gains steam far too quick and runs on vapors by its end no thanks to a hammy Law as the evil ruler Hunnam needs to thwart and largely unknown supporting cast that is one big shrug as to who they are and what are there true purposes.

16,neil-476,Not as good as some of the bits which make it up,6,9 May 2018,"King Uther Pendragon, betrayed and usurped by his brother Vortigern, saves his son who is brought up in a brothel. Years later, Arthur pulls the newly revealed magical sword Excalibur from a stone, which puts him in Vortigern's sights. Battle is joined between Arthur and assorted rebel factions, and the magically-assisted Vortigern's army. But Arthur has some magic on his side, too.I like knights in armour, magic, swords and sorcery. And, like Batman, Arthurian legend is robust enough to withstand multiple interpretations. It is interesting to see Guy Ritchie run it through a Lord Of The Rings / Game Of Thrones filter. That is perfectly fitting, and it is an element of the film which works well.If only the rest worked as well. This film has achieved significant box office disaster in the USA, and it is easy to see why.There are two main reasons. One is the storytelling, which is muddled. Action sequences, well staged, often lose their impact because of too much shakycam, rapid cutting, and excess closeup. There are too many characters for the plot. Many are unnecessary, and not given enough attention for them to register. So we don't care about them, which means it doesn't matter when they are in danger, or when they die.Apart from Jude Law's Vortigen, Aidan Gillen's Goosefat Bill, and Eric Bana's Uther, most of the cast simply don't make a mark. ""Oh, look - there is an oriental king-fu master in mythical mediaeval England, how weird!"" Yes, but so what? We never get to spend enough time to feel anything about him.Charlie Hunnam is Arthur. The character is written so as to be an unsympathetic smart-arse who comes good in the last act. Unfortunately, this means that the actor playing him needs a sympathetic, powerful screen presence in order to carry him through the early part of the film. Think Harrison Ford as Han Solo in A New Hope. Charlie Hunnam is no Harrison Ford, and Arthur irritates rather than inspires. Also, his accent is horribly unhelpful and, I suspect, a bit impenetrable for international audiences.The story itself is fine - albeit chaotically told - and the tweaks to the legend work. I particularly liked Vortigern's magic coming at a terrible cost. Also the modern-day flavour to the dialogue is often amusing, and works well. The effects and action are good, and the production design is terrific. So there are elements to be enjoyed.But, as someone who really likes this type of film, and also Guy Ritchie's offerings in general, this was a disappointment to me.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

When fate leads him to pull the legendary Excalibur from the stone, Arthur embraces his true destiny to become a legendary fighter and leader.....Maybe I enjoyed this more than I should have because of all the really sniffy reviews. And to be fair, while the dialogue is all apples n' Pears and Oi Oi saveloy, Ritchie does have an eye for a decent set piece, even though the story resembles the legend as much as Inglorious 'you know what' resembled WWII.And what makes it more fascinating is that Ritchie has envisaged a Lord Of The Rings type film with action scenes that resemble Sherlock Holmes, with the script of a really poor episode of a slightly uplifting Eastenders entry.It's a failure for sure, but only once in a blue moon do we get a failure of such epic proportions that actually entertain, and are destined to become a cult favourite in years to come. This year we've already had The Great Wall, and before that, Jupiter Ascending.And these films are a rarity. It's the predictable flop. These three films were destined to flop from the get go, and seeing as Ritchie had planned a six part franchise, just makes you want to see it all the more.So we have Huge Elephants, Jude Law doing his best Alan Rickman impression, Geoff Bell playing the same role he always has done since he's ever been an actor, big snakes, impressive 3D, and of course a wonderful cameo from Masters Of The Universe's own Skeletor.The narrative is everywhere, but it thinks it's being clever by doing the Ritchie trick of a speech being told in real time and also foresight, which used to be endearing, but now seems a little too smug for its own good.Oh and then there is David Beckham, who makes Pele look like an award wining actor.It's going to be one of the years biggest failures, there is no doubt about it, but everyone involved is going to come out of it unscathed, because it's just too ridiculous to hate, and to silly to be annoying.If only it was called King Ar'fur....",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

I mean, I didn't had any problem with the giant elephants or with the whole story.

Movies like Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Rocknrolla. Those are the style movies he should make and not one about King Arthur. King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword is a big budget movie, no doubt about that, with alot of effort with the special effects, CGI's, costumes and extras. But the problem is the story and the acting. The story is just weak, and sometimes makes no sense at all. Even with all the special effects, that are nicely shot, it still remains boring to watch. The acting was just mediocre, it looked like they were reading their script all the time. Charlie Hunnam can only play Jax, his character in Sons Of Anarchy. I was literally waiting for him to step on his bike and drive away. I don't know what women see in him, his acting is very monotone and average. The acting of Astrid Bergès-Frisbey playing The Mage was also just mediocre. It looked all fake, just like the whole story.

Purcell's opera might be thought an exception, but Davies discounts it on the basis that its plot differs radically from what we have come to think of as the traditional Arthurian story.Fuqua's film was billed as a more historically accurate version of the legend, treating Arthur not as the mediaeval knight portrayed in, among others, ""First Knight"" from the nineties but as a Roman cavalryman in fifth-century Britain. It was, however, rather dull, Clive Owen made an uncharismatic hero and it contained so many historical howlers that its claims to accuracy looked very hollow.Guy Ritchie now brings his own interpretation to the story, which he sets not in a recognisable Roman Britain nor in a recognisable Middle Ages but in a sort of vaguely sub-Tolkienesque fantasyland. As the story open, Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, king of the Britons, is at war with a race known as the Mages, who have magical powers, such as the ability to conjure up gigantic beasts like elephants (only much bigger) to assist them it battle. You might think that this gives the Mages an unfair advantage, but in fact Uther is able to defeat them. This, however, proves a Pyrrhic victory, because soon afterwards he is murdered by his treacherous brother Vortigern, who seizes his throne.Fast forward a number of years, long enough for Arthur to have grown from a baby into Charlie Hunnam. Vortigern does not seem to have grown a day older in the intervening thirty-odd years, and still maintains his tyrannical rule. Rumour has it, however, that one day the Born King will return to liberate Britain from tyranny, a rumour which strengthens an active resistance movement. The ""Born King"" is, of course, Arthur, only he doesn't know it yet. And then one day a stone with a sword sticking from it mysteriously appears. Only the Born King, it is said, can pull the sword from it.Ritchie is probably best known as a former Mr Madonna, but apart from that he is best known for directing Cockney gangster flicks like ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", and this film is essentially a Cockney gangster flick translated to a sub-Tolkienesque fantasyland. (And, yes, it is just as weird as that sounds). Before he discovers his identity as the Born King (and to some extent afterwards as well) Arthur, or perhaps we should call him Arfur, is a regular lowlife Cockney geezer who has grown up among prostitutes and petty crooks in the slums of Londinium. (Although the action does not explicitly take place in Roman times, the Roman name for London has been kept). More Arthur Daley than King Arthur. When not earning his living in ways which would not bear too much close inspection, Arfur likes to hang out down the local boozer with his mates, who mostly have traditional Arthurian names like Bedivere, Tristan and Percival, although there is also a Bill and a George in there. (I don't recall them from Malory).The rest of the plot is far too complex to explain, but it details how Arfur accepts his new-found identity, learns to develop his magical powers and takes his revenge on Vortigern. In doing so he has the assistance not only of his aforementioned mates but also a pretty female Mage- not all Mages are bad- played by Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey, winner of a Special Oscar for ""Actress most in need of a new stage name, at least for English-speaking audiences"".This film was, apparently, intended to be the first instalment in a six-film franchise. That would explain a few things. It would, for example, explain why Arthur, generally portrayed as a teenage boy at the time of the ""sword in the stone"" incident, is here played by the 37-year-old Hunnam; Ritchie obviously wanted the same actor to play the character throughout the series. It would also explain why the film only deals with the early part of Arthur's career; there is, for example, no Round Table, no Lancelot, no Guinevere and no Holy Grail. Merlin is mentioned but does not actually appear. There is a character named ""Mordred"", but his role is not that of Sir Mordred in the traditional legend.Unfortunately, I am not sure how many of the remaining five episodes will actually be made. The film has not only performed poorly at the box-office but has also been savaged by the critics. And, I must say, not without reason. Ritchie's film is really no better than Fuqua's. Hunnam certainly makes a more charismatic hero than did Owen, and Jude Law is reasonably good as the treacherous Vortigern, but none of the rest of the cast stand out. The film is overlong and the plot is frequently over-complicated to the point of incomprehensibility. The production budget was apparently $175 million, and I cannot really say it was money well spent.Michael Phillips, film critic of the ""Chicago Tribune"", called Ritchie ""one of the world's most successful mediocre filmmakers"", and my only quarrel with this assessment would be that on occasions ""mediocre"" has seemed too kind an adjective. (The abysmal ""Swept Away"", which had the inadvertent effect of sweeping away Ritchie's then-wife's film career, is a case in point). On this occasion, however, it seems that success has eluded him. 4/10",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
22,Hellmant,"I recommend you see it on the big screen, while you still can!",9,17 May 2017,"'KING ARTHUR: LEGEND OF THE SWORD': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Director Guy Ritchie's new updated take on the King Arthur legend. He directed the film and co-wrote it, with Lionel Wigram and Joby Harold. Charlie Hunnam stars in the title role; and Jude Law, Astrid Berges-Frisbey, Djimon Hounsou, Aidan Gillen and Eric Bana costar. The movie has received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's bombed at the Box Office so far as well. It was made on a budget well north of $100 million, and it was supposed to be the first film planned in a six movie series! I loved it.In the film young Arthur (Hunnam) rules the streets of Londinium, with his loyal followers, and he's completely unaware of his royal lineage. One day he's stopped by the King's men, and sent to attempt to draw the legendary sword Excalibur from the stone it's been lodged in. When he's successful, King Vortigern (Law) sees Arthur as an immediate threat. So he attempts to have him executed, before a large audience. The Resistance, lead by Sir Bedivere (Hounsou) and The Mage (Berges-Frisbey), rescue him though. Arthur then must learn to use his newly discovered powers, master the magical sword, and accept his true destiny; of stopping Vortigern's evil reign, and replacing him as the rightful king of England.The movie has been heavily criticized by critics (but it's mostly loved by movie fans) for it's extremely fast pace, and very quick editing style (plus it's excessive shaky camera usage). These are all things Ritchie is well known (and loved for) though. I think it's a lot more entertaining, and a better made film, than the 'SHERLOCK HOLMES' movies (which were loved by critics for some reason, despite the fact that they're made in a similar style). This movie is a little like 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' mixed with 'SNATCH'. I think it's immensely entertaining, and I had a blast seeing it on the big screen. I recommend you do the same, while you still can!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b6j-_hcq7Wo",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

24,bowmanblue,There could be a good film in there somewhere,7,17 August 2019,"It's safe to say that opinion was divided when 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword' was the released. The critics seemed to absolutely hate it and the public didn't think it was that good, too. Okay, so opinion wasn't that divided after all. Anyway, from the amount of hated this film received before it was kicked out of cinemas and branded a 'flop' you'd think that all you'd see online were 1 star reviews. However, now that I see what the public seems to think about it, I can actually stand by my opening statement about it leaving audiences divided.Sure, it's got it's fair share of 1 star reviews, but it also has more 5 star reviews than you'd expect based on how it was originally received. About fifteen years ago, Hollywood decided to 'reinvent' King Arthur in a more 'gritty' fashion and made a film starring Clive Owen. And, despite 'Legend of the Sword' also trying to reinvent King Arthur in a gritty and realistic fashion, Guy Ritchie's interpretation adds fanciful direction, superhero-like fight scenes and giant elephants. In fact... probably the biggest elephants every created by digital effects for the silver screen.When director, Guy Ritchie, was promoting the film, he described it as 'Lord of the Rings' meets 'Snatch.' Yeah, I can't really sum in up any better. Only that does probably sell it a little more than it's worth. Yes, there are plenty of epic battles and computer effects which remind you of the 'Lord of the Rings' films and, yes, the dialogue seems like it was additional scenes left on the cutting room floor after 'Snatch' had been edited. The main problem is that 'King Arthur' feels like it should have been about three hours long and then cut down to only two hours. For all the good bits it contains, it feels like it's a whistle-stop tour of the actual story.Charlie Hunnam is the titular King Arthur and he plays the hero pretty well as he tries to reclaim his birthright from his evil uncle (Jude Law) and his army of Kylo Wren impersonators. He doesn't have too much to do other than look 'buff,' but he's a watchable enough hero. Jude Law is good when he's in it, but - again - he's not in it enough for us to really get to know and his only job appears to just be evil. And, while we're on the subject of casting, who gave David Beckham a cameo? Sorry, but no matter how well he can bend balls, he really can't act!I hear the film went through some major reshoots before release. I'm guessing that these were the parts of the film that really do feel 'thrown together.' And, not only do they feel out of place, any special effects used seem to be done on the cheap. There are some pretty good effects here and there, but they're not constant enough to feel like they belong in such a big budget production. Plus the sets look a little too 'modern' for the time period. No, I'm not saying they look like they belong in today's world, but I'm sure the time period King Arthur was supposed to be set in didn't look like the world which is depicted (what we see looks more like only a couple of hundred years ago, rather than about 5-800 years ago). It all feels more like Robin Hood's era than King Arthur's.If you're a fan of Guy Ritchie's directing and dialogue then you'll get plenty for your money. However, the film is so weirdly slung together that it's all just turned into a bit of a rushed mess. There's a scene in the middle of the film that actually feels like a trailer for the film itself. I've never seen anything like that before. It's very jarring.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
25,ThomasDrufke,"Lock, Stock, and King Arthur",6,11 May 2017,"After a week of reviewing and studying up King Arthur related movies and television, I finally got a chance to see the newest incarnation, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. The result? It was pretty much exactly how I expected the film to pan out. And as it turns out, there wasn't much need to go back and watch previous installments in the series, considering Guy Ritchie's overwhelming style makes this the most unique Arthurian film to date.Of course, that's both good and bad. I'll always appreciate films that take pride in creating their own world, over films that are far too derivative. With that said, Ritchie's style can get tiring, as it does in most of his films. Whether or not you'll enjoy this film I think solely rests on how much of Ritchie's directing you can handle. There's certain things he does incredibly well here, including some gorgeous wide shots and an impressive grasp on how to effectively shoot the action scenes. That is, when the action scenes are in camera rather than being a CGI modeled mess.The aforementioned action scenes are perfectly complemented by an unexpectedly epic musical score. I half expected the music to be too modern and out of place, but composer Daniel Pemberton found the perfect mix of modern and medieval to account for probably my favorite aspect of the movie. I also didn't expect to like Charlie Hunnam's turn as the great King Arthur so much. In fact, I think I liked his performance more than the actual character himself, which gets bogged down by shallow motivations (as do most of the characters).Overall, it's hard not to have some fun with this new incarnation of the Arthurian Legend. It's fast paced, gorgeous to look at (except when parts of the final battle look like a video game), and weird enough to please fans of 1981's Excalibur. As long as Guy Ritchie tones down his style a bit, I would be down for a sequel (although there's no way this film ends up profitable). Here's hoping.+Music+Most of the action-Except for a video game-like final fight-Ritchie's style is overwhelming6.7/10",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

27,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,31 July 2017,"King Arthur: Legend of the SwordKnights only wore their suit of armour when they'd secretly send street urchins to battle in their stead. However, the scoundrel in this action-fantasy won't need to impersonate one for long.Reared in a brothel by courtesans, the orphaned Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) grew up to be a petty criminal, completely unaware of his royal pedigree.That is until he abstracts a sword from a stone and learns the King of England (Jude Law) is actually his uncle, and that he killed his father (Eric Bana). The king now hopes to invoke black magic to end the Pendragon lineage.Directed by Guy Richie, this rip-roaring reimagining of the Arthurian legend never relents with its stylized swordfights, clever dialogue and liberal alterations to the source material.

28,The-Sarkologist,King Arthur- Guy Ritchie Style,9,22 May 2017,"In some what I'm not all that surprised that Guy Ritchie decided to do a King Arthur film, though I wasn't quite expecting it to be a film done in Guy Ritchie style. In a sense it sort of comes across as being his typical dark and gritty film yet in another sense it is also very much an heroic fantasy. In a way it is a shame that the film flopped the way it did because it was actually a pretty enjoyable film, and I certainly quite like Ritchie's style of directing. Okay, a part of me didn't quite get the humour of the piece, particularly since we had a similar style in all of his films. However, what we do need to remember is the Ritchies style has always been very gritty, and King Arthur is no exception.The thing with Arthur is that there are quite a lot of stories out there, and none of them are really the same. I guess this is the nature of a legend. Interestingly some of the stories don't even have Arthur meeting Merlin (and this is the case in this film). In fact Arthur didn't even get to meet his father, but I suspect that is consistent with a lot of the legends. In this film we have the sorcerer Mordred ravaging the land, however in the aftermath of the battle, Uther's brother slays his wife to gain power, and releases a demon that kills both Uther and his wife, but allowing Arthur to go free. However, before he dies the sword, Excalibur is buried in rock and only the true born king can pull it out.Much of the film is really about Arthur coming to terms with who he is. He grows up in a brothel and in true Guy Ritchie style, through perseverance, charm, and simple determination, basically becomes a underworld figure. However the false king suddenly discovers that as long as the sword is in the stone (and for quite a while it was underwater, however the water then drained away revealing it to all), then his power isn't going to be complete, so he sends out his troops to round up everybody Arthur's age to see if they can remove the sword. As you can probably guess Arthur succeeds. However, because is the true king, he is a threat, so he is about to be executed, except the rebels, who have been simmering around for a while, rise their heads and attack.The other thing that the film reminded me of was Macbeth. In fact it appeared to be a retelling of the Shakespearian play using the Arthurian heroes as opposed to the Shakespearian heroes. The reason that seemed to come about was the appearance of the three witches that lived in the lake. Okay, unlike Macbeth, this film focuses more on Arthur than on the protagonist, but it seemed to come out that way a lot. However, what really grabbed my attention was that despite it being heroic fantasy, it still have the real grittiness of your typical Guy Ritchie film, and it is a real shame that it is a flop because it isn't actually as bad as the takings make it out to be (though this may have a lot more to do with the extravagant nature of the film as opposed to any inherent problems with it).",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
29,Reno-Rangan,A different take on the sword in the stone!,7,14 November 2017,"This one came with a little surprise. I know it was a Guy Ritchie film and I had enjoyed all his previous flicks. But for some reasons, I felt I'm not that interested in this. Even trailer looked okayish. Watching the film now I realised that I've totally misjudged it. Still not a masterpiece, but a much better entertainer. The graphics were awesome. The settings were totally encouraging to glue to it. The story, stunts, with some of the slow- motions, very detailed and muscularly enchanting.Everybody knows the basic storyline of King Arthur. In this, it opened with two brothers feud and following a young man grew up in a brothel. When the city slowly gripped with the myth that the legendary prince would return to the crown, now the king, Vortigern vows to find him first and end the threat. But what comes after him was beyond his expectation. He has to finish it off what he had failed years ago. On the other hand Arthur has all the support, particularly the legendary sword passed on to him by his father.I had liked the Disney animated film back when I was a kid. This was completely a different film. For the live-action, it stood and delivered what viewers had expected. The music was another advantage. All the actors were good. The rise of Charlie Hunnan. His recent films were pushing him to the next level. Surely a lookout star. Despite a poor box office, it is a much better film. Once again the film critics got it all wrong.

31,tomgillespie2002,Will likely induce a headache more than any sense of wonder,3,7 September 2017,"Guy Ritchie may just one of the luckiest film directors in history. After making his name with Cockney gangster movies Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, he released a double-bill of stinkers so bad that even the utterance of their titles provokes sniggers. Swept Away and Revolver almost killed the career of the Brit before it truly took off, with his highly publicised relationship to Madonna proving far more interesting to the tabloids than any of his desperate output. He returned to his roots with RocknRolla, a motor-mouthed crime comedy which, although sitting well within his comfort zone, was good enough to remind us of why we liked him in the first place. Since then, he's found big-budget success with the Sherlock Holmes films and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (although the latter tanked at the box-office, it was generally warmly received by those who saw it), and has been handed the keys to his very own franchise, the eternally rebootable story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.It's unclear just how much more input Ritchie will have on this new take on Arthurian legend, as he has just started production on Disney's live-action remake of Aladdin, starring Will Smith as the genie. That, combined with the box-office failure of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, would surely suggest that this series was dead on arrival, or at least will see it taken in a new direction by Warner Bros., who had been trying to get something off the ground ever since the more grounded 2004 version starring Clive Owen. If this is true, then thank the cinema gods, as this annoying, sickly and exposition-heavy turkey was never going to interest a new generation of cinema-goers in a legend that has fascinated many for years. It trips up during its very first moments, as giant, CGI elephants knock down CGI buildings and send CGI people to their death, removing all the elements that make this old-fashioned myth so endearing by employing a contemporary attitude. Haircuts, fashion and dialogue all fit Ritchie's lad's mag aesthetic.Everything needs to be big and shiny, and King Arthur opens with a set-piece most movies would choose to climax with. King Uther Pendragon (Eric Bana) is locked in a war with warlock Mordred and an army of mages, with the kingdom of Camelot under threat from their magic. Assisted by his magical sword Excalibur, the King triumphs, only to be betrayed by his evil, pampered brother Vortigern (Jude Law), who arranges a coup to usurp the throne. Only Uther's son Arthur escapes with his life, pushed down a river to be raised by prostitutes in, as you would guess from a Ritchie film, Londinium. He grows up to look like Charlie Hunnam and practises hand-to-hand combat. He also dabbles in petty theft with a small gang of cheeky chappies while unaware of his true heritage. When Uther's sword reappears stuck in a rock near the castle's ground, Vortigern rounds up all the men in the nearby areas to attempt to pull it free. He who succeeds is the true heir to the throne, and therefore destined for the chopping block.This all sounds like a classic hero's journey set within the medieval fantasy genre, but Ritchie is so intent of shoving modern- day sensibilities down your throat that it's easy to quickly forget the true essence of the story. There are endless visual gags involving a story narrated in the present while we flash back to the actual event, a gimmick employed by Ritchie many times before (but was done far better in Ant-Man), and an abundance of camera-swirling action scenes that resemble a video game cutaway scene. At times, it is the cinematic equivalent of that G-force ride at the fairground, in that you cling to whatever you can and hope it ends before you vomit. At the centre of it all is Hunnam, who follows his turn in Pacific Rim with another charisma-free performance. He is drawn as a tough- working-class hero who would be more comfortable in a pub brawl than ruling a country, but comes across as the kind of meat head seen on a night out starting fights while others insist he's a good guy really. A dick head with a magical sword and royal blood is still a dick head. Many of its flaws could be forgiven were it not such a massive bore. Instead, this will likely induce a headache more than any sense of wonder.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
32,Thanos_Alfie,Guy Ritchie's direction will never change...,5,7 March 2018,"""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" is an action movie in which we watch the legend of King Arthur. After he left by his parents in order to be saved, Arthur returns to claim his kingdom and his throne as a king. But after he pulls the sword from the stone he understands that this won't be easy to do since he has to practice and understand his true strength. He is also forced by it, to understand his true legacy and how important it is. Only then he will be ready to hold the Excalibur in his hands and makes his dream true.This movie uses the legend of King Arthur and Excalibur a bit wrong and that's the reason why it's another average movie and nothing more. The direction which is made by Guy Ritchie it's mostly the same as in ""RocknRolla"", ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"", but in the ancient time. At some points, the conversations between the characters are fast without any reason, humor between the characters is liked we are watching a movie that is filmed today and not in an ancient time and the only way to understand this, is by saying that it is directed by Guy Ritchie. I liked the interpretations of Charlie Hunnam who plays as Arthur and Astrid Bergès-Frisbey who played as The Mage. Jude Law who plays as Vortigern makes a poor interpretation in this movie. At this point, it has to be mentioned that some of the soundtracks of this movie like ""The Devil and The Huntsman - Sam Lee & Daniel Pemberton"" are simply amazing and I liked them a lot.Finally, I have to say that ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" is an average movie and nothing special. With a budget of $175 million, Guy Ritchie succeeded in making a poor movie which reminds us some of his previous movies due to his direction which was the same. You will just waste your time by watching this movie, don't have high hopes because it's directed by Guy Ritchie and you won't be dissapointed by it.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
33,cruise01,"Guy Ritchie's take on the Arthurian Legend is big and loud, but feels out of place for his style.",6,12 May 2017,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword tries to be an epic fantasy film going over a legend tale. The film is loud, big, and dumb with its overuse of Guy Ritchie's style. For those, who have seen Sherlock Holmes films or The Man from U.N.C.L.E, would know what I mean. At least his style worked with those films that has the detective tone or spy thriller. But for a historical legend, with his script that adds modern dialogue, and a street wise cracking character that he turned King Arthur into. It just feels out of place. For the most part, King Arthur is an enjoyable action film for what it is. It is an origin story before Arthur and knights had the roundtable. Unlike Antoine Fuqua 2004 King Arthur movie was, which was still a better film. The story begins with an epic battle with sorcerers and giant elephants crashing the gates to Camelot. Pendragon (Eric Bana) tries to defend his kingdom, only to get betrayed by his brother Vortigen (Jude Law). Pendragon sends his son Arthur away from the kingdom. Who gets picked up and raised by prostitutes in a brothel. Years go by, and the sword Pendragon held reveals itself as the lake draws back. Vortigen fears the son would return to assassinate him. He sends man out to go hunting for Arthur. When Arthur was able to pick the sword (Excalibur) up from the stone. Vortigen orders his man to execute Arthur. Until he is rescued by Mage (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) who has magic that can manipulate animals. With Vortigen dark magic growing. Arthur and his man will have to face against evil, as he learns from the power of the sword. The cool thing about this King Arthur film is it does try to have style. Either from its big visual set pieces and action. Or the way cinematography is set during action or its quick editing cuts to build chaos, making it an adrenaline rush. Yes, its director Guy Ritchie's style. Feels like a kid retelling the Arthurian legend. Or creating the battle scenes. It is entertaining and fun for a while. This style does overuse itself to being annoying. When characters in the film retell stories to others and has a sequence that tries to backtrack, showing their storytelling can be annoying. Definitely Richie's style since his last three films did it too. At least, the movie score was cool. Charlie Hunnam was decent as Arthur, playing a wisecracking character that wants nothing to do with power. Astrid Berge-Frisbey as Mage was good, her character was quite interesting. Only wished there was a backstory for her. Jude Law felt a little miscast as the villain. The film does have a few action visual set pieces. Some fast paced stylized sword fight scenes. The climax battle with Arthur and Vortigen, it had some insane camera work and visual effects. It was fun to see. Overall, King Arthur was a fair fantasy film. It had some fun big action battle scenes and visual set pieces. But it does not make up for the movie with Guy Ritchie's direction and his technique of storytelling, his modernizing script, and some decent acting. Its one of those action films that's worth seeing once and this take of the legend is forgettable. I recommend this film as a rental or if you want to see it on the big screen for its loud action, which is what the film only, has to offer.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
34,eddie_baggins,"A big, dumb, loud and fun Hollywood blockbuster",6,21 May 2017,"Opening with quite literally raging giant elephants waltzing into battle, this big, dumb, loud and genuinely ADD blockbuster is anything but your typical take on the longstanding King Arthur tale.In what's supposed to be the first of 6 new King Arthur films (this is now highly unlikely due to this films extreme flopping at the Box Office), British bad boy Guy Ritchie has once more found himself away from the small budget character and dialogue driven pieces like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch that bought him worldwide fame and instead leading the charge of a massive budget and filmmaking playground in which he can enact his particular brand of movie making magic on a Hollywood sized scale.Ritchie's style over substance approach worked wonders with his reimaging of the Sherlock Holmes cannon and anyone familiar with those Robert Downey Jr adventures will instantly recognise similarities with Legend of the Sword, but despite the spectacle and grand visions, Legend of the Sword fails to ever properly engage and becomes a blockbuster experience that's entertaining in spits and spurts, but almost entirely forgettable once the credits begin to role.Supposedly clocking in at around 3 hours in its original cut, you can see the legacy of Legend of the Sword's troubled production history (the film was original penned in for release last year) on the final product as it stands with many pieces of the puzzle not fitting into place as the film stands today.Characters appear and disappear only to reappear out of nowhere, often barely allowing us time to remember their names. Sequences such as a bizarre ""Dark Woods"" segment or a Viking run-in feel like parts of the movie Ritchie and his screenwriters tacked on just because it seemed cool while Arthur himself as played by Charlie Hunnam never fully clicks into place as a leading man we come to care for.Never a problem with past versions on either screen or print, Hunnam and Ritchie have made Arthur a relatively arrogant piece of work and whilst initially his roguish nature makes him seem entertaining, as the runtime wears on and his attitude remains the same, it becomes rather unappealing and with Hunnam taking the majority of the film's key character scenes, others like Jude Law, Djimon Hounsou and Aiden Gillen barely get a moment to work their supporting magic.At least the male supports get more to do than Ritchie allows for the token females in the picture with Annabelle Wallis relegated to a few brief scenes while Astrid Bergès-Frisbey as The Mage delivers a genuinely terrible performance filled with trite dialogue and equally unfortunate delivery.With a large amount of flaws appearing over the film like a bad case of the boils, it can't be denied that when Legend of the Sword kicks up the action it really does become an over the top ride that you can't help but enjoy despite knowing better.Filled with Ritchie's trademark quick-fire editing, a score that ramps up tension and some great over the top fighting and foot chases, Legend of the Sword becomes a much more tolerable experience when it's forgoing the serious and focusing on the fun and while a few select sequences feel far too much like a video game come to life, Ritchie's unique talent for spectacle takes the film up a notch from where it arguably deserves to be, even if oversized snakes aren't as cool as Ritchie thinks they must be.Final Say – Frustrating more often than not and filled with a collection of characters we should care a lot more for, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword isn't ever going to eventuate into the series it could've been, but with Ritchie as usual providing the visual treats, this over the top retelling of a well-known tale is a fun and disposable example of Hollywood at its most bombastic.3 retired soccer stars out of 5",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
35,leonblackwood,"Big in scale, small in entertainment! 5/10",5,8 October 2017,"Review: Although this movie looked pretty, and the CGI was used to it's full capacity, I still was left feeling a bit empty when the film finished. There wasn't much depth to the characters, except for King Arthur (Charlie Hunnam), who took ages to except the power of the sword, Excalibur but the rest of the characters gave there life for King, who didn't take his role seriously until the near end. I also think that Jude Law (Vortigern) was a bad choice as the villain, and Eric Bana (Uther) was taken out way to early. Anyway, the movie is about a king, Uther, who is loved by is Kingdom but is killed by his brother, Vortigern, so he can gain power and all of its riches. Whilst killing his brother, Arthur, Uther's young son, escapes in a boat but he witnesses the murder of his father, which sticks with him for the rest of his life. Arthur is then brought up in a brothel, were he saves his money and gains respect, as an adult, from his fellow villagers but Vortigern is having problems as the king, because he is feared more than loved by the kingdom. He then hears of a sword which is stuck in a rock, which can only be taken out by the King's son, so he sends men out to search for the Uther's son, to crush the myth that he is a true King. Now with Arthur captured, Vortigern attempts to kill Arthur in front of the whole village but he is saved by disciples, who believe that he can save the world from the evil Vortigern. With the magical sword in his power, Arthur and his disciples decide to take down Vortigern but he also has magical powers, after making a deal with the devil. Its truly an ""over the top"" storyline, full of magic, action and mythical characters but it takes too long to get going, and you don't get to see the power of the sword until the very end. Like every Guy Ritchie movie, we get the slow motion action scenes and banter between the characters but it wasn't enough to save this mediocre movie, which cost a hell of a lot of money to make. The wit throughout the film, didn't touch the clever writing in Lock Stock or Snatch, and the huge snake scene, along with the weird looking sea monster which was controlling Vortigern, looked completely ridiculous. Anyway, I wasn't a big fan of this movie and it seems like Guy Ritchie has lost his touch with his last few films but it's good to see him have a go at projects that are out of his comfort zone. Average!Round-Up: Guy Ritchie, 49, first hit the scene in 1998 with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Swept Away, Revolver, Rocknrolla, 2 Sherlock Holmes movies and the Man from U.N.C.L.E., which have all made him a big player in Hollywood today. He's due to release a live action version of Aladdin starring Will Smith and Naomi Scott in 2019, and he has another Sherlock Holmes movie in the pipeline, so although this movie lost a lot of money at the box office, he's not holding back from the big budget projects. Charlie Hunnam, 37, first came to the big screen in Cold Mountain, which also starred Jude Law, and then he went on to star in Green Street, The Ledge, Deadfall, Pacific Rim, Crimson Peak and the Lost City of Z. Personally, I don't think he was the perfect choice for this movie, mainly because he didn't seem to blend in with the other characters but that's just me. Anyway, this movie is certainly large in scale but it just didn't work for me.Budget: $175million Worldwide Gross: $149million (Flop!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/dramas, starring Charlie Hunnam, Astrid Berges-Frisby, Jude Law, Djimon Hounsou, Eric Bana, Aidan Gillen, Freddie Fox and David Beckham. 5/10",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The ""story"" told is so generic that you would not miss anything if you would just watch the first 5 and the last 5 minutes.

Guy Ritchie tries to a do a style that he did similar in the two Sherlock Holmes, but it worked in those movies, but doesn't here. Now effects are pretty descent, action scenes are pretty good at times, but the rest of the film feels like it's less then nothing, some things here look horribly edited.The actors are basically sleepwalking through this, including Jude Law who plays the bad guy, who is usually a good actor, but kind of looks like he doesn't want to be here, and seems he did this movie has a favor for Guy Ritchie. And let's not forget actor Geoff Bell, once again the same type of character he played in Tormented(2009), and Kingsman: The Secret Service(2014), you pretty much know what to expect from that.

40,jamesrupert2014,About what I expected: fitfully entertaining but ultimately forgettable,6,4 September 2019,"Arthur, son of Uther, and true king of Britain, draws forth a sword from a stone - carnage and justice follow. The film is yet another pseudo-historical sword-and-sorcery epic updated for modern sensibilities and, typical of a Guy Richie movie, contains lots of tough guys, quick patter, and hyperkinetic action. The story is a mishmash of classical Arthurian legend and contemporary super-hero shtick, with Excalibur ending up as some kind of supernatural über-weapon. The cast is fine given what's expected from them, although some of the humor is a bit forced (especially the silly pseudo-epilogue that introduces the soon to be 'Round Table') and the main characters are a bit too deliberately relaxed to take very seriously (Jude Law (Vortigern) tends to lounge around his stolen throne like every day is casual Friday at the castle). There is nothing new in the film, just the now standard CGI-driven battles and melees but, if you're not an Arthurian purist, not looking for novelty, can ignore huge implausibilities, and forgive numerous anachronisms, you'll likely find the film an entertaining timewaster. Apparently, 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword' was intended as the opener to a six film franchise (the next was to introduce Merlin) but the movie's poor showing at the box office put the blade to the neck of that ambition.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
41,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,9 August 2021,"Yeah, this is a bad movie. I remember rolling my eyes when it was announced, I just knew it was going to be bad... and I knew it was going to be bad for all the reasons I like Guy Ritchie movies....... there are one or two Anti-Woke reviews. A Black guy in Arthurian Britain? Yeah I hate wokeness too, but let's be fair, he isn't in Arthurian Britain, he's in a Guy Ritchie movie... that means the casting probably wasn't done to be woke, it was done because Djimon Hounsou is pretty cool... but that is part of the problem... not that there was a Black guy in a Guy Ritchie about King Arthur, but that it was a Guy Ritchie movie about King Arthur and he was cast because he is cool, hip, an actor that you would cast in a modern movie and.... That doesn't work for King Arthur.The same thing goes for Jude Law... just no, not right for that part. And, again, not right for the same reasons... a little too hip. A little too cool. A little too modern.Charlie Hunnam, believe it or not, I can see in the role... if it wasn't for the dialogue. When he was first cast I was against it. But, honestly, there are times where I think he could sell it if it was taken a little more seriously.Tom Wu, on the other hand... just no you do not need a Mr. Miyagi ultra-hip kung-fu teacher in Arthurian England. That is the character that a middle school writer is going to add because he thinks it's cool.And then the bad guys? Same as Tom Wu, they were added because Ritchie saw 300 and thought the immortals looked cool enough to add to the story.It's a bit too hip for King Arthur, especially since he's introduced as the typically Guy Ritchie criminal that you would see in Snatch, Lock, Stock, whatever with all the same British Tarrintino dialogue that comes with him...... only done as King Arthur.And that doesn't really work. King Arthur doesn't have to be stuffy, but he also shouldn't be written as three seconds off of breaking into Cockney rhyming slang either.It's kind of an important tradition, an important story, an important bit of culture that people identify with as a nation... it really doesn't need the Snatch treatment. It makes everything feel out of place.Not only that, but the intro is so jarring that you almost walk out before the movie gets rolling. Fx wise, it is everything wrong with First Knight, everything wrong with 10,000 BC, and the 04 King Arthur. It just looks a bit too Lord of the Rings.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
42,stevendbeard,Entertaining But Script Could Use Polishing,6,12 May 2017,"I saw ""King Arthur:Legend of the Sword"", starring Charlie Hunnam-Sons of Anarchy_tv, Pacific Rim; Jude Law-the latest Sherlock Holmes movies/Robert Downey Jr versions, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow; Astrid Berges_Frisbey-Angels of Sex, Pirates of the Caribbean:On Stranger Tides and Eric Bana-Hanna, Star Trek_2009.This is a retelling/origin of the famous King Arthur tale, told by director Guy Ritchie. He did the most recent Sherlock Holmes update plus he did the same for The Man From U.N.C.L.E. in 2009. I have also read that this movie is the first of a six picture franchise, depending on the box office of this one, of course. Charlie plays Arthur, who lost both of his parents at an early age and was raised by.....Well, let's just say, ladies of the evening. Jude plays Charlies' uncle that has quite the evil streak in him. Jude kills loved ones in order to gain mystical powers and when I say loved ones, I mean his own wife, daughter, etc. Eric plays Charlies' father/Jude's brother, who was the previous king until Jude took over after Eric's untimely death. Charlie grows up not even knowing his royal heritage but he does learn how to fight-If you remember, Guy Ritchie did the same thing with the Sherlock Holmes movies. Djimon plays a friend and comrade to Charlie, as does Astrid, a mage-she knows magic spells and controls animals. The movie covers the pulling the sword from the stone bit but throws in new information you probably never knew, as a bonus-I don't want to give too much away but lets just say that at one time, the stone the sword is stuck in was alive. There is also a cameo of soccer star David Beckham- look for him in the sword removal scene-and I also spotted Guy Ritchie. The movie is not bad; It looks great and the fight scenes are good, but the script could have used a little polishing. Also the editing is off the wall. The story jumps from past to present and then back again, quite confusingly. It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence, language and suggestive content and has a running time of 2 hours and 6 minutes. If the story-line was a little better, I would buy it, but as it is, it is only a good rental.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
43,alindsay-al,A good interesting take on this medieval tale,7,24 May 2017,"This film has had extremely mixed reviews so I decided to judge this film on my own viewing and I will admit that I did like this film. The premise of this film sees a boy separated from his birthright attempts to take down his uncle who has taken the throne. Charlie hunnam, who is a busy man at the moment plays Arthur in this film and I thought he did a really good job in this film. He added a lot of personality to Arthur and I found him entertaining to watch, I also thought he did a decent job in the dramatic scenes that make you care about him and sympathise with him. He also added a lot physicality to the role and does deliver in the action scenes. Jude law plays the villain in this film and I thought he did a really good job too, he is a bit over the top but it really works for this film and I found him pretty compelling. Djimom honsou plays an ally of Arthur and I liked him in this film and the chemistry he had with Arthur. Eric bana plays hunnams father and even though he isn't in the film lots he gives a good performance when he is on screen. However, I didn't really care about the mage character in this film and her story arc and it felt forced into this movie. The story has an interesting coming of age story which I did believe and enjoyed watching. However, there are a few side story arcs that I didn't care for as mentioned before that did take away from the overall experience. The script has some pretty quick witted dialogue that surprised me but was definitely enjoyable to watch. But sometimes it does go overboard and it can come across as just quirky dialogue for the sake of it. The style of the film especially for the first five mins is incredible and I really enjoyed it, this film has guy Ritchies style all over it and that is sometimes enjoyable but sometimes out of place. I also found the final battle pretty disappointing with an over use of CGI and it was pretty poor. Overall I liked this film and think if you are a fan of guy Ritchie's you should see this film you will probably enjoy it like me.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
44,iquine,Fingerprints of Guy Richie Everywhere,7,7 December 2017,"(Flash Review)This movie should come with a warning for those with certain health conditions, as this take on King Arthur was hyper-fast paced with rapid cuts and jarring camera shots at times. Mixed with many creative and mythical beasts and dramatic battle scenes, there was a lot to visually digest. Guy Richie used his directorial style and put a surreal spin on this well-worn and famous story. The core of the story is the basic tale of Arthur's upbringing, the sword stuck in the stone scene and the legacy he is faced with. Many cool battle scenes with assorted enemies, quality CGI, doses of dry humor and the acting and dialog were passable enough to not grimace. Overall, a different spin on the story with modern editing and effects and does not mislead your expectations.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
45,Fluke_Skywalker,King Arthur Begins,5,15 January 2018,"Plot; Hidden away as a boy, a now grown Arthur returns and reluctantly finds himself in a battle with his Uncle for the crown and the kingdom that are rightfully his. Though I love John Boorman's flawed masterpiece Excalibur, I've long hoped for an epic cinematic adaptation--in fact a saga--worthy of the legend. Guy Ritchie's take isn't... it.Occasionally fun, even genuinely good in all too brief fits and starts, this de facto King Arthur Begins ultimately fails to find a consistent groove. Ritchie's signature style is on full display, so any hope of majesty is snuffed out before it even begins, but there was a fun knockabout interpretation buried in here somewhere.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

47,s3276169,"""Cor blimey Governor"" just doesn't work in this context.....",5,11 August 2017,"The first thing that is glaringly wrong with King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is the tone of the film. Its 19th century London transplanted back in time to a medieval ""other-verse"" that is Arthurian legend. The ""cor blimey guvna, kippers for breakfast"" thing simply falls flat and feels contextually ""wrong"". The other key issue with this film is its disjointed presentation. It jumps and bounces, from scene to scene, like poorly constructed wagon wheels over a peasants dirt path. Suffice to say this is a visually and thematically jarring experience, that provoked round after round of cognitive dissonance and left me playing mental ""catch up/fill in the blanks""more than once.Character development not surprisingly is stunted. You get to know the main character but the motivations of other players are left largely unexplored. A real shame given the talented line up of actors. On a positive note the action scenes are plentiful and well thought through for the most part. But so much else has been overlooked its really not enough to lift this film above the standard ""beige"" action formula. Five out of ten from me.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
48,peterp-450-298716,I don't care about the criticisms. I liked it.,8,7 August 2017,"""How'd you get money from a Viking? I feel a joke coming on here."" Ever seen me excited before? Then you should have been there, when I was watching this movie. Perhaps because it's a movie that's being razed to the ground by the most appreciated film critics. How do they actually evaluate a movie? Do they use a minutely compiled questionnaire with a precise step-by-step plan to evaluate a movie? Armed with a decibel meter, lux meter and a comprehensive Wikipedia reference about the subject, so technical and substantive negligence can be spotted right away? I know, I know. Smart readers will of course immediately ask me the following obvious question: ""Say wiseguy. What's the base of your judgement of a movie?"". To be honest, I don't know. Is it a gut feeling? Or temporary insanity? Believe me, I don't know but read on and I'll tell you everything you need to know.Lets start with the proclaimed criticisms which were excessively exaggerated in my opinion. Some claim that this was an outright disgrace to the great legend about King Arthur. At first I don't think that was the intention of the creators. And by the way, had they done this (which means that all involved characters who played an important role in this legend, probably also would have gotten a spot in this movie) then other whiners would say this flick is just a copy of a previously made movie. In my opinion, if you want to experience a historically accurate story, follow evening lessons about medieval history. These are accurate enough. No, this was a pimped, modernist version of a medieval legend.Next point that gets on my nerves is the whole fuss about Beckham. I've read that he got the part thanks to his friendship with one of the leading players, but that he's better in juggling with a ball than in acting. Give me a break. That bloke was only a few minutes on screen. A rather limited contribution to judge someone about his acting capabilities (Although I'm not waiting for a movie with Beckham playing an important part).And finally, the style of this film by the hand of Guy Ritchie. Frankly, I had to get used to it myself. Strangely enough, I have never seen a movie directed by him before. But after seeing this movie, I plan to fill up this cultural gap because this tastes like more. In other words, you can call me a real Guy Ritchie fan from now on. That driven, flashy and hyper-kinetic narrative style was quite confusing at first, but once I got in the flow of the movie, I began to appreciate that style. Not only is it a fascinating style, it also makes for subtle and raging scenes. Even conversations were filled with humor because of the style.""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" is a mix of different types of movies. From ""Lord of the rings"" and ""The Hobbit"", to ""Fast & furious"" or any other slick action movie, making it a medieval story with a modern jargon being used. The action filled scenes, especially those where Arthur suddenly holds Excalibur with both hands, are breathtaking. It looked like ""The matrix"" with a bunch of knights. And then there's the magic. ""TLOTR"" was magical and full of fantasy. But also this movie contains a considerable amount of magical elements, even though the illustrious Merlin is just in it for a split second. The Darklands with its unworldly creatures. The Mage (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey) who, by means of telekinetic powers, can summon the animal kingdom to intervene and also has alchemical wisdom about herbs. The sea witches helping Vortigern (Jude ""Gigolo Joe"" Law) to gain power. Mordred, a sort of Lord Sauron, who attacks Camelot with an army of monstrous-looking elephants. And all this is shrouded in a fabulous and dark atmosphere.Even the cast was interesting enough. Charlie Hunnam played the role of Arthur with bravura. Not the Arthur we know from the legends, but a born fighter who grew up in a brothel and along with his companions Wet Stick (Kingsley Ben-Adir) and Back Lack (Neil Maskell) earns his money in a not so honest way. You can hardly call him a noble and righteous man. Frankly, I didn't recognize Astrid Bergès-Frisbey immediately, even though she played a fascinating role in ""I origins"". The acting wasn't her main concern here but the mysterious nature of her character was, which she played in a convincing way. But also the less important secondary persons were of a valuable addition.Well, apparently I'm swimming against the grain again with my opinion. To be honest, this was one of the most energetic and entertaining movies I've seen this year. ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" is a hell of a roller-coaster raging over you like a bulldozer. For those who haven't seen this modern King Arthur interpretation yet, just one advice : ignore the negativism about this movie, go see it and get overwhelmed by this movie.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

52,jadepietro,"A Revisionistic Tale of King Arthur, I Think",6,3 January 2018,"GRADE: C+ THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED. JIM'S REVIEW: To say that this King Arthur story is unlike anything one has ever seen before is an understatement. With its monstrous serpents, non-stop combat scenes, black magic spells, and kinetic swordplay, Guy Ritchie's revisionist tale, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, is never dull. But it never makes much sense either.Edited to an addled frenzy, the director's trademark quick cuts and exaggerated stunt-work keeps everything at a feverish pace. More obsessed with the action, the movie never stops to establish characters or their relationships. Plotting is meaningless as we go from one battle to the next. Characters rush in and out. Exposition is said and forgotten. Somewhere in this crazy mix is the story of young Arthur fighting against his evil uncle, and his army of demons. As with all of Mr. Ritchie's films, production values are strong and action scenes are well staged. It's all nonsense, well-crafted, but nonsense, nevertheless. CGI effects are short on overdrive and long on sensory overload. If it's action you want, it is all you will get with this movie.As it is, the storytelling itself is hard to decipher. The real world and the fantasy universe merge like a giant fireball of confusion as the film repeatedly flashes back and forward to tell its tale. The screenplay (or more accurately, rough outline) cobbled together by Joby Harold, Lionel Wigram, and the director deconstructs the Arthurian legend and piece-meals it back together (Arthur the orphan, the Excalibur sword and the stone, Camelot legend, Knights of the Round Table, etc.), but so much filler has been added that the story could easily have been a totally different (and new) mythological hero and no one would have noticed. Be forewarned: you may eat up the action but the nutritional value is nil.Charlie Hunnam plays the once and future king and he swashbuckles with the best of them. Jude Law is his power-hungry foe and he acts the role with Shakespearian menace. He also wears black well. Djimon Hounsou, Aidan Gillen, and Eric Bana make an appearance to add a small degree of class to this enterprise. Astrid Berges-Frisbey wanders through the movie with a blank-eyed stare. Yes, she is playing a sorceress, but she looks mostly confused like the rest of us.Purists will hate this modern updating, but King Arthur: Legend of the Sword will be an enjoyable diversion for most moviegoers.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
53,Rob_Taylor,Cockneys vs. King Arthur,5,25 June 2017,"Well, you have to give Guy Ritchie some credit, he took Warner Bros 175 million dollars and went nuts with it! Sadly for WB, this is a bizarre movie that suffers from multiple personality disorder. Sometimes it thinks it is Lord of the Rings. Sometimes it is Game of Thrones. At others, it tries to be Snatch, or Lock, Stock. However, what it never really tries to be is King Arthur.What seemed like a potentially good idea on paper - namely using a Cockney/Snatch template on an enduring legend - fails badly. The acting and accents are, at times, awful enough that I expected Danny Dyer to pop up for a cameo, perhaps as the shortest knight ever. Unfortunately, he doesn't, but we are treated to a brief David Beckham cameo which is nowhere near as satisfying.As far as the story goes... your guess is as good as mine. Rather than make a King Arthur tale, we are treated to writers who took a couple of names and themes from the myth and then decided to write a fantasy epic. Regrettably, the only thing epic about King Arthur is how badly it fails.Hunnam is tolerable as Arthur, who here is an orphan brought up by prostitutes, whilst Djimon Honsou is utterly wasted as Bedivere. In fact, most of the cast get no real love in this movie and are reduced to corny quips and Cockerney accents that would make Dick van Dyke swoon with delight. Merlin is gone, replaced with some foreign woman who can't act her way out of a paper bag (and a wet one at that!) The CGI is not good in many places and further detracts from what is, essentially, a fantasy movie with a lick of Arthur paint thrown on it.So are there any redeeming parts? Well, a couple. Again, however, they are all too short. The opening few minutes paints the picture of a great fantasy epic a la Lord of the Rings, but then nothing like it is seen again, so don't get your hopes up. Later on, Arthur is forced to go to the Darklands (a kind of dark mirror version of the world, full of monsters and evil). This is given the montage treatment and offers you tantalising glimpses of an idea that is far more interesting than the rest of the movie. Again, don't expect any more of that after it is done.Jude Law plays, of course, the villain of the film, but honestly, his villain isn't at all menacing. I kind of felt sad for him - Jude Law, that is - he must have needed a paycheck badly, but then again, I doubt he realised how poor this effort was going to be.As the title of this review suggests, everything is Guy Ritch-ied to death here. Cockney accents, fast cuts, montages, cunning plans and exposition about those plans. It is a mediaeval Lock Stock. This just further detracts from the film and all it really needed to be complete would have been Ray Winstone popping up and going on about ""Slaaaags!""In short, it is quite the assault on the senses, and the sensibilities. Possibly the worst Guy Ritchie movie to date.SUMMARY: Horrible mish-mash of style, legend and bad CGI. Terrible accents galore, poor acting and a massive feeling of ""gone too far"" about this one. Reimagining at its worst.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
54,eric262003,A Guy Ritchie Fan Fictional Account to a King Arthur Story,5,10 July 2018,"There's no denying that the background is quite the eye-opener in Guy Ritchie's ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"". But when it comes to the storytelling that is the meat and potatoes of this movie, then that's just a subject in itself. This stands for all the films that Ritchie has directed. Why do we need another half-backed version of King Arthur? Rictchie knows it's been done before, but being so stubborn he decides he wants to do an adaptation of his own along with outrageous elements he could add to it which doesn't work on a lot of levels. If you're expecting the King Arthur story you've been read to in school, you will be disappointed.The opening scenes might spark some intrigue though not necessarily needed as dark images appear as the evil Vortigern (Jude Law) as he succeeds in killing his older brother Uther Pendragon (Eric Bana) and takes possession of the crown. Fortunately, Uther successfully sends his son Arthur to a place of consummate. Twenty years later, Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) returns, unknown that he is blessed with royalty. But after he successfully managed to remove a sword from a stone, he knew there was something unusual about him. Arthur joins forces under the guidance of a Mage who worked for Merlin (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) to get revenge on his uncle Vortigern and claim his rightful place on the throne.What's you first impression when King Arthur comes to mind? Not giant snakes or tree people or other concocted fantasy creatures that Ritchie arbitrarily added to the story. All we have are a series of CGI elements that have replaced the character struggles of revenge with the family which should have been the main focus of the movie. It's all about fantasy land and little about character development or themes about vengeance, betrayal, or romance. It's about appeasing to the modern spirit and gladly rubs it down our throats every chance it gets.The style over substance runs the course of this movie throughout, like the only thing Ritchie even cares about is reaction over thinking. The camera work is very shaky as the imagery either speeds up or slows down and the editing has the feeling as if it was an overlong music video. When characters run, they are accompanied by shake cameras and the CGI graphics are pure overkill that Ritchie was trying to outdo Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"", but failed miserably, because at least in ""Lord of the Rings"" there was a story being told.All off this eye candy is a distraction to what the real intentions were for this movie, a vengeful conflict between King Arthur and his uncle Vortigern. Though Charlie Hunnam and Jude Law were very good in their respected roles, the sad part is they're hardly on screen at the same time. The dependence on visual reaction was so overwhelming we forget that there is a story happening which should have been the primary focus. Law's real purpose to this film made to have top villain the film for Arthur to take down rather than explore the conflicts, the history or the knowledge of Medieval England. Ritchie only care about being hip on the subject matter.It's not a complete abomination, though I can't really recommend it. The acting especially from from Charlie Hunnam and Jude Law was really good and the visuals was very well executed. Plus the score by Daniel Pemberton was very catchy. But the elephant in the room was Ritchie's storytelling and the CGI was very over-the-top and was more purposely set to reaction rather than telling its story across. by around the two hour mark, you're just glad that movie's out of the way.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
55,WeAreLive,Awesome Movie,10,15 October 2017,Not that long ago I saw this movie on the plane when I was coming back from my holiday in Canada. I have to say this was the best movie I have watched in 2017 which is live action.I liked the bit with the snake where the snake was massive and he was helping Arthur and mainly the last battle.Overall a good movie even if you haven't read the book. Like me.,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
56,bkrauser-81-311064,Far from Legendary,6,14 May 2017,"Did we really need another King Arthur movie? The legend, its various symbols, its thematic arcs, its outmoded characters etc. have all existed in some permutation seemingly since the beginning of film history. The last good adaptation, if we're being honest, was the half-forgotten Disney film of the 1960's. That is unless of course you include Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) as the quintessential movie about wielding executive power based on watery tarts throwing swords.Yet here we are in the time of extended universes and increasingly self-serious fandom adaptations, getting director Guy Ritchie of all people to cash in on everyone's fascination with The Game of Thrones (2011-Present) series. Though for what it's worth Ritchie seems to know that he's an unexpected choice to helm this project and admirably leans into some of the flourishes that made him a household name a decade ago. Let it be known that for all its faults, you can pile on ""idiosyncratic"" onto the list of adjectives used to describe this movie.You can also add on words like, busy, rushed, light on suspense and predictable even for a King Arthur movie. Which is surprising since the setup for the film strips away many of the modes of the original legend and replaces them with worldly complications and post-modern, Dark Souls-like ornamentation. It all starts with a blood feud between Uther (Bana) the rightful King of England and his brother Vortigern (Law) who's ability to conjure dark magic gives him the leverage to take on the throne. Arthur (Hunnam) as a small child is sent down a river Moses-style, finding refuge in a London-town brothel. From there he becomes a small town hooligan with a heart of gold, graduates to being a professional magic sword puller and the rest you largely know. This time instead of getting much needed guidance from Merlin (a figure spoken of, but never seen), Arthur gets his X-Men meets Lord of the Rings tutelage from a flinty mage (Berges-Frisbey) whose involvement is probably to distract that so many named women in this movie are tossed aside and/or killed.The film works best when it focuses on the grimy and the gritty. This Arthur is less a product of posh, natural charisma and more an intelligent rascal whose intimate knowledge of the criminal underworld pumps the gas on an already fomenting revolution. The context of the small and unnamed is a small but interesting feature that should have been explored a lot more. If for no other reason than it would have given Guy Ritchie a better opportunity to indulge in his speed-up-speed-down, MTV era ingenuity and hypothetical-hyper-planned monologuing.If only the film didn't yank us through an ugly hodge-podge of boring exposition, suspiciously convenient, magic-themed psycho-babble and erratic franchise maintenance that does little in the service of the film's characters. In this version, the sword Excalibur is not just mythical, it's downright diabolical with its ability to grant the wielder super-human strength, speed and dexterity. Arthur for what its worth already possess many of those traits but he can't hold the sword double-handed because, according to the Bedivere (Hounsou), ""he's not ready for it."" Convenient, now the movie can milk its nebulously constructed cudgel for the purposes of dragging out the run time.That's ultimately what all but kills this movie - it's a drag. And not the kind of drag that made Antoine Fuqua's 2004 version such a grounded but trifling diversion. No this thing, with its liberal amounts of magic, monsters and kung fu (I kid you not, this King of England knows kung fu), wants you to take everything as seriously as a stroke. Thus we get long moments of people blathering about this or that prophecy and staring at each other with suspicion and malice. A task that someone like Jude Law is naturally suited to but Charlie Hunnam? The less he talks the better.The film's remaining questions, combined with a naively buoyant epilogue hints that more is to come. It is rumored that The Legend of the Sword is one of a planned six movies - Six! Why would they do that? They hardly captured anyone's imagination, let alone attention with this mess. Even with the promise of Merlin and Lancelot joining the fray, this franchise feels like its only going to get worse. I kindly ask Warner Bros. not to continue on this quest for Camelot. Let's not go there - it is a silly place.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
57,arungeorge13,Another Ritchie adaptation that doesn't sizzle! [+48%],5,28 July 2017,"Let's be honest here. We love Guy Ritchie more for his original screenplays 'Snatch, 'Lock, Stock', and to an extent 'RockNRolla'. Whenever he has chosen to adapt or re-imagine a previously told story like the 'Sherlock Holmes' series or 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E', the results have been underwhelming (okay, maybe the first Holmes was quite fresh but the cast had a major role to play in its success!).'King Arthur' is by far the least entertaining Guy Ritchie 'adaptation'. The movie is what you call a CGI sh*tfest. While the opening intrigues, the proceedings that follow don't. Ritchie's break-neck editing style doesn't really work wonders in a movie touted to be an 'epic'. The banter between Arthur and his friends does invoke hints of Ritchie's freakish talent in raising mirth during overwrought scenes. But it never quite hits the mark. Hunnam looks fit as hell, looking the part but lacking the emotional connect. You don't feel a thing when he is seemingly going through the 'toughest phase of his life' while encountering the monsters in the Darklands. The movie does gain some composure during the assassination-attempt sequence, that boasts of appealing cinematography work by John Mathieson and rousing music by Daniel Pemberton. Action isn't exactly Ritchie's forte and in 'King Arthur', CGI rules the roost. Ritchie-usuals though are present: the frequent cutting-away of the camera to different perspectives, the zoom-in & out technique, relentless application of slo-mo and lightning-fast stunt choreography (aided by CGI).Eric Bana is effective in his brief role of Uther while Beckham's cameo is laughable. Jude Law, as Vortigern, is mean-looking and at times, towers over the protagonist. The rest of the ensemble unfortunately don't get to leave much of an impression as their characters are inadequately written or simply present to mouth supposedly 'smart- ass' one liners, as in other Guy Ritchie movies.Verdict: Not sure if I'd be excited for a sequel!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
58,MR_Heraclius,King Arthur,7,12 February 2020,"Let's be clear: this contains very few aspects of the actual Arthur legend. They probably should have just gone for a wacky original medieval fantasy film instead. That being said, I didn't expect Ritchie's style to work this well here. And he hasn't been this crazy since Snatch. Some montages are so breathless, fast and innovative as far as editing and soundtrack go, it's a pleasure. Sure, the plot follows the genre conventions more or less, and the finale is a bit heavy on CGI. On the other hand the assassination attempt sequence is fantastic and the portrayal of magic pretty cool. Hell, I had fun with this.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
59,Screen_Blitz,Guy Ritchie's interpretation of King Arthur saddles just enough flashy action set pieces to make up for its uneven execution,6,9 November 2017,"This action-fantasy adventure sees the titular source material getting the Guy Ritchie treatment, and that name alone should just a little bit of light on what you are in for. His style is greatly engraved in nearly frame, and that means, for better or worse, drifting away from the style that the King Arthur is most known for in previous incarnations. Capitalizing on mounds on heavy action set pieces, this movie marks just another entry in the park of big- budget action flicks with nothing truly ambitious at hand but to grip audiences with piles of cutting-edge CGI and special effects to serve as the forefront of its Medieval setting. The final results work, but only to a fault. The capital flaw lying in Ritchie's interpretation of the classic character is the narrative which struggle to find an even balance between extravagant action and overcooked exposition. It only leaves you with the impression that had the potential to something much better. This movie takes us the ancient city of Camelot where we meet Uther Pendragon (played by Eric Bana), the ruler of the land who leads an army to fight against an invasion against lead by Mordred and his band of warriors who threaten to destroy the city. When his jealous brother Vortigern (played by Jude Law) leads an assault that kills Uther and his wife Igraine (played by Poppy Delevingne), their son Arthur (played by Charlie Hunnam) an orphan. Twenty years later, he grows up and sets out to find Vortigern with the assistance of resistance leader Sir Bedivere (played by Djimon Hounsou) and the Mage (played by Astrid Berges-Frisbey). But first, he must hone the power of the Excalibur sword. This movie never quite rises above anything beyond a go-for-broke action foray, but that doesn't fully defeat how fun it can be at at times, especially when it is not teetering on overdrawn exposition. Easily the biggest draw to Guy Ritchie's execution is the visuals which are heavily engraved on the nifty production design exhibiting a moody feel of the Medieval times, almost reminiscent to the Middle Earth settings in the 'Lord of The Rings' trilogy. And the scenes showcasing the title character slicing and dicing in a series of swordplay battle sequences punctuated with slow-motion shots are undeniably fun to sit through. But the hyperkinetic atmosphere can only do so much to compensate for the flawed script which bears trouble in landing a proper balance between intense action and overlong exposition that never seems to find rest stop with its use of flashback montages. To describe in greater detail, the montages alone make up what feels like nearly half of the two-hour runtime, occasionally hindering the pacing. Of course, thanks can be given to the climatic battle sequence at the end when Charlie Hunnam's Arthur embraces his chance to turn the tables on the antagonistic Vortigern. In a satisfying performance, the English actor fuels the role in deep charisma that makes his character worth rooting for. Jude Law should also be commended, though perhaps not in what would fit the category of his most remarkable roles. At least the actors don't let the talents go to waste. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is not what I would call a glamorous cinematic landmark in even the slightest. But it provides just enough cutting-edge thrills to pass for good popcorn entertainment. But for a film that is rumored to a start of a franchise, its quality may not reach the heights of what would rise above a stand-alone feature.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

63,one9eighty,Oh dear,2,6 August 2017,"""King Arthur: LotS"" is the riches to rags orphan who is destined to be a great leader. First he must overcome his own doubts and paranoia to become strong enough to defeat the evil Vortigern. Everything that happens along the way is aimed at building on the character but in earnest he isn't actually that different at the end of the film to what he is at the start of the film. This is a typical Guy Richie cockney geezer style film which really let me down, it feels like he just used ""Lock Stock and two smoking barrels"" or ""Snatch"" direction notes and put them over a script which featured a King Arthur based stories. The version of the story portrayed here was unoriginal and uninspiring and it was delivered averagely at best - that's to say there was little in the way of acting masterclasses. Considering this was supposed to be a Hollywood style blockbuster it really wouldn't have felt out of place on the SyFy channel with excessive use of bad CGI and Pinnochio wooden acting. In fact there were times it felt like I was watching somebody playing an XBox/Playstation game rather than an epic film. There were times that the CGI was that overused, coupled with erratic and jumping camera that I had no idea what was actually going on. There were fight scenes - or there were supposed to be anyway - but I couldn't tell you what actually happened, I just know that King Arthur emerged without a cut or bit of dirt on him. This is a pity, some medieval TV/film fights really help shape the features and make them memorable and enjoyable - ""Battle of the Bast@rds"" on Game of Thrones was brilliantly done and could be a top example of how to do it right, but even films like ""Camelot"" (1967), ""The Magic Sword"" (1962), hell, even fighting in the 1938 ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" starring Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone was better than this... I'd even suggest that Monty Python's Holy Grail had better and more authentic fights, and that's a tongue in cheek comedy!!Being a typical Guy Richie film there are random edits to show multiple events occurring, especially when characters are telling stories. This has been done before though, it may be a signature editing technique for a Guy Richie film but there are times when it becomes confusing and even pretentious. If I have to explain to my girlfriend, who isn't a cinema novice at all, what exactly is going on and which version is the 'happening now' version, then the film is undoubtedly confusing at times. This is the kind of confusion that lets the film down rather than something that makes the film cool. This is style over story, aesthetics over substance. While it may be good looking it isn't always authentic and sometimes the good looking additions are taken too far that they become blatant and stupid. The bad guys all worship and fear the evil leader who is surrounded by Nazi-esque symbology to spell out to the audience that he's the bad guy. For example, when Vortigern is about to kill Arthur when he's first identified the crowd all salute Vortigan with a 'Heil' arm salute, they are standing in front of an eagle engraving and flags much like the Nazi's used, and the troops are wearing a uniform that could be recognised as Wehrmacht colouring. On the opposite of this Arthur and he band of merry men predominantly wear whites and lights to make sure the audience know they are the good guys. Despite being set in medieval times beards and stubble are perfect, clothing is perfectly stitched, there weren't really any fat or ugly people - practically all the woman you see are slim and slender beauties - no toothless bearded hags that you'd expect to see in this era. To conform with the PC police there was a white man, a black man, an Asian man, Scandinavians, Celts - they only needed to satisfy the disability and LGBTQ quota to have a full house. The reason I mention this is because it was out of place in history, world wide travel hadn't become mainstream enough for all these ethnicities to find themselves at exactly the same time - this was done for the film's audience rather than authenticity. I've read a lot of history to be able to write that confidently enough FTR. Having seen and read lots of version of the fictitious life and times of King Arthur this version really stretched belief and not in a good way - it butchered some of the more romanticised versions I have experienced and stands out as one of the worst depictions of the story. I know it's all fiction anyway so it could be reinvented in a clever way, this however wasn't. It doesn't have to be the old stories to be a good film, it wasn't the old stories, but nor was it a good film. If you want to see a version of ""Lock Stock and two smoking barrels"" performed as a medieval film with pretty looking aesthetics but a unoriginal story-line then look no further. I can only assume that the reviewers who have given this 10 stars are hardcore Guy Richie fans rather than cinema/film fans. As a King Arthur story I'd have rated this as a 1/10, as a action film (forgetting the content) the highest I could rate this is 3/10 - as such my final score is 2/10. NOTE: I don't normally like writing massive reviews like this but I was so let down that I couldn't stop writing, and the more I wrote the more I got angry and upset and what I'd watched, and that's even without mentioning David Beckham's token cameo which add's nothing at all to the film or his reputation!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

65,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A vehicle for a handful of intense Excalibur action sequences.,6,8 March 2019,"Years ago, I watched Guy Ritchie's first film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998). I thoroughly enjoyed the comedic repartee, well-paced action, and simple heist scenario. Afterward, I decided to watch the rest of his films (omitting Swept Away (2002) for obvious reasons). Films like Snatch (2000) and RocknRolla (2008) held very similar premises, but even in his other films like Revolver (2005), you could see the distinctive style Ritchie has when he shoots his films. In hindsight, not all of these films are great, but they were certainly entertaining for me.Enter Sherlock Holmes (2009), and this big-budget film gave Guy Ritchie a bit more mainstream attention, as it also sported Robert Downey Jr. on a career hot streak. The striking visual style remained, which also helped in the sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011). Because I also enjoyed the 60's period piece, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015), I was equally excited for King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017). After all, Ritchie had shown he knew how to do action in his previous films, and a story centering around King Arthur and Excalibur would likely have a lot of action.When I finally saw King Arthur, I wanted to like it more. Sure, there were fragments of Guy Ritchie's style in this film, including an occasional bit of dialogue back-and-forth, some quintessentially Ritchie cinematography, and a few fantastic action sequences, but it just felt flat concerning the plot. Half the time, I had no idea what the characters' motivations were, or what they were trying to accomplish, and I had a pretty basic understanding of the Arthurian legend going into this movie. Perhaps the reason it wasn't as entertaining as I wanted was that it wasn't a buddy film. The constant, humorous dialogue between characters is truly what makes a Ritchie film great, and this movie had barely any of it at all.A vehicle for a handful of intense Excalibur action sequences, I give King Arthur: Legend of the Sword 3.0 stars out of 5.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
66,RforFilm,"Without good characters, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a grim mess that gets a lot wrong to make the Monty Python version more believable",2,16 May 2017,"Hollywood loves a good underdog story. As a plot device, underdog characters (especially famous ones like Charlie Chaplin's Tramp and Rocky Balboa) are relatable and build a lot of sympathy from audiences that have gone through something similar. Comedic or dramatic, it would seem that the key for success is to try and make the character an underdog in some format. The film of today's subject happens to be one of the most well known: King Arthur. It's been heavily debated on whether there was a real historical figure because he stood for what was right in an era of England where war raged with Celtics and Saxons. Though he has had many adaptations, my favorite is still The Sword in the Stone (or if you really want something strange, then Monty Python and the Holy Grail).A gritty retelling of the Arthurian legend is not a bad idea and as soon as I heard that director Guy Ritchie (RocknRolla, Sherlock Holmes) was going to head it, I was intrigued. The man knows how to make some exciting action scenes and reignited an interest in the detective of Baker Street, so I figured that him doing King Arthur would be a good fit. Instead, we got King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. In the kingdom of Camelot, the king is murdered by his brother Vortigern (played by Jude Law) who is able to use magic when he sacrifices his wife to summon a demon knight. Baby Arthur escapes when he is sent down the river and is found by women. Through the years, Arthur (played by Charlie Hunnam) develops street smarts and fighting skills, but continues to have nightmares about the night his parents were murdered. He has no idea of his birthright and continues to live under the Nazi-like regimen of King Vortgern.Like in the tales, a sword in a stone arises from a lake where several men attempt to pull it without success. It comes out when Arthur pulls it out, but faints overwhelmed by it's power. The young man is sent to be executed to stop the prophecy. He's saved by an unnamed mage (played by Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey) and taken to a secret hideout where Bedivere (played by Djimon Hounsou), Percival (played by Craig McGinlay) and Tristan (played by Kingsley Ben-Adir) are waiting. Though reluctant, Arthur eventually starts a series of events that lead to him to try and reclaim his place on the throne.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is an example of style over substance. The movie not only looks good, but it's clear that all the work was put into the design of this Camelot. It even has a plot that should keep things moving. So why doesn't it work? Guy Ritchie seems to have forgotten the rule of storytelling that character is the most important element of a good script. Arthur is a really bland hero who whose given a bland performance (which surprises me as I've seen Charlie Hunnam in better material). To his defense, almost the majority of the characters are just as lifeless.A lot of that also has to do with the way it's edited. It seems that the director wanted to get to the action scenes faster by getting through scenes by using a lot of fast wording and mixing battle plans with executions of those plans. Sometimes it can work, but it also costs us time we could have used to gotten to know our heroes. There's one scene that shows Arthur growing up an learning that could have been twenty of minutes of development, but the scene goes by so fast (about five minutes of flash edits), you barley have time to figure out what kind of a person he is.I'll give this two Excalibur swords out of ten. There's a lot to work with the Arthurian stories, but the majority of the movie is a complete misfire. Bad acting, bad writing, bad editing, bad visual effects (including a giant snake that looks unfinished), and even occasional bad cinematography makes this an instruction on how NOT to make a summer blockbuster. This is sword that should have stayed sunk.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
67,petra_ste,Why have enemies when you can have friends?,5,12 June 2020,"As someone who liked pretty much all Ritchie's previous movies, I'd say this is a mixed bag.The movie has some imaginative visuals and creature design, like the creepy monster/witch/thing in the underground lake, and a moody soundtrack.The villain, played with malicious glee by Jude Law, is also effective. Ironically, the black-hearted bad guy is the only one with any meaningful characterization. Although, frankly, given the choice between becoming a scythe-wielding abomination and staying married to Katie McGrath, I'd toss the scythe into the nearest garbage bin.Sadly, Arthur (Charlie Hunnam)'s followers are not as interesting; they are a multitude and barely distinguishable in terms of personality - the unnamed female mage, Littlefinger, Djimon Hounsou, the kid, the blonde spy, the redhead, the kindly prostitutes who raised Arthur, the wounded one, the kung fu teaching Asian guy... yeah, kung fu in Arthurian legends, it's that kind of movie. And in bad guy's entourage we have bad guy's daughter, Roose Bolton, bearded lieutenant, bald lieutenant... And in the prologue Uther, Mordred, Igraine, Elsa...It's A LOT of people, too many for a two hours movie where a huge chunk of the running time is action set-pieces, so none of them is given time to develop a memorable personality. It feels like one of those ""Game of Thrones in under 2 minutes"" videos. Funnily enough, the two characters everyone does know from the Arthurian legend other than the titular protagonist, Merlin and Lancelot, are either onscreen for two seconds (the former) or absent (the latter).Overall, this reminds me of The 13th Warrior, another watchable historical fantasy/adventure which flopped and had a huge cast of characters but developed like three of them.5.5/10",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

After lifting the sword from the stone, Arthur has no other choice but to fulfill his true destiny. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a brilliant film. Director Guy Ritchie has showcased his signature styles of shooting, in his take on the Arthurian legend. The visual effects are spectacular. I highly recommend that you watch this movie in 3D(I watched the movie in 2D). There are many scenes worth watching in 3D. The action set pieces are slick. Despite being a period fantasy, this film feels like a modern action movie. Guy Ritchie has added yet another unforgettable movie to his filmography following, Sherlock Holmes(2009), Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows(2011) & The Man from U.N.C.L.E.(2015). Performance-wise, there is nothing to fault. Charlie Hunnam is perfect as Arthur. Hunnam brings his signature swagger to his portrayal of Arthur. This makes our protagonist, even more likable. Astrid Berges-Frisbey is great as The Mage. Jude Law is outstanding as Vortigern. Djimon Hounsou is impressive as Bedivere. Eric Bana is superb as Uther. Aidan Gillen is good as Bill. Freddie Fox, Craig McGinlay, Tom Wu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Neil Maskell, Annabelle Wallis & Geoff Bell are brilliant as Rubio, Percival, George, Wet Stick, Back Lack, Maggie & Mischief John, respectively. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a must watch for all Guy Ritchie & Charlie Hunnam fans & fantasy film buffs.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

70,dave-mcclain,a creative and nearly perfect interpretation of Arthurian legend,10,12 May 2017,"At its most basic, the story of King Arthur boils down to this: He was a fabled king of Britain in the late 5th and early 6th centuries, whose legend has grown and expanded over the millennium and a half since. Historically, we don't know for sure whether Arthur actually existed, but literarily, not only can his existence not be denied, but it cannot be avoided. Tales of the great king and his court, called Camelot, his wife Guinevere, his right-hand-man Lancelot and the rest of the Knights of the Round Table, his wizard Merlin and Arthur's magical sword Excalibur have been told, retold, changed and embellished over the centuries by books, stage productions and other media, including, of course, television and film. A countless number of TV shows and movies have referenced the legends and many have used ""Excalibur"", ""Camelot"" and, of course, ""Arthur"" in their titles. In 2017, auteur Guy Ritchie gets into the game with the action-adventure-drama ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" (PG-13, 2:06), the first in a series of films reinterpreting the Arthurian legend with Ritchie's signature creative flare for reinvention. In launching a new franchise, Ritchie gives us an origin story which expounds upon the age-old tales, introduces new elements and characters and combines other stories and legends into a cohesive whole.In this film, as in the legends, Arthur is the son of King Uther (Eric Bana). After heroically fending off an attack on Camelot by the ruthless evil wizard Mordred and his mammoth war elephants (reminiscent of those in the film ""300"", but bigger), Uther further enhanced his own stellar reputation among his court, his people and everyone except for his ambitious, but faux loyal brother, Vortigern (Jude Law). Vortigern soon kills Uther and his wife, but Uther's Excalibur is lost in a lake and the king's two-year-old son gets into a boat and floats away. In a twist on the biblical story of the young Moses, Arthur is plucked from the water by a group of women, prostitutes, in this case. They raise Arthur as their own and he is mentored by an Asian man called George (Tom Wu) who teaches Arthur how to fight. Arthur grows up to be a man of honor and a protector to the women who cared for him his whole life, but his past catches up with him, threatening everything and everyone he knows and changing his life forever.When the waters of that lake recede and expose Excalibur embedded deep in a large stone, Vortigern worries that young Arthur survived his aquatic exile, grew up and may come back to claim his father's throne. Believing that only the rightful heir to the throne can remove the sword from the stone, Vortigern orders that all young men in the kingdom be brought to the castle and made to try doing just that. When Arthur reluctantly takes his turn, of course, he removes the sword – and the ground actually shakes. Arthur is pretty shaken too – because he has grown up thinking his mother was a prostitute – and because the power flowing through the sword is so strong that it knocks him unconscious. When he wakes up (locked up), he tells Vortigern that he has no designs on power, but it would clearly make Vortigern's life easier if Arthur were out of the picture – permanently. Unfortunately for Vortigern, Arthur gets help from a Mage (a magical human – played by Astrid Bergès-Frisbey) as well as a rebel named Bedivere (Djimon Hounsou) and his cohorts (including Aidan Gillen, Freddie Fox, Kingsley Ben-Adir and Neil Maskell) and even Vortigern's wife, Maggie (Annabelle Wallis). These characters play a role in helping Arthur learn to harness the power of Excalibur and convince Arthur of his responsibility and his unique ability to save the kingdom from Vortigern's power hungry, abusive and murderous ways.""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" is one of the best movies from the first half of 2017 – and one of the best action movies ever. It builds on a well-established and multi-faceted legend and incorporates elements of other movie franchises, but Guy Ritchie's visionary directing makes this cinematic King Arthur tale very special indeed. According to IMDb, the film was pitched to Warner Bros. as a combination of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Snatched"" (Ritchie's 2000 film), but I see the finished product differently. In addition to those films, I see the influence of TV's ""Game of Thrones"" and the films ""300"", ""The Ten Commandments"", ""The Godfather"", ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" and, of course, Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes films. The creative cinematography, editing and visual effects from his earlier movies are more highly developed and more entertaining in this one. Also, the performances are uniformly outstanding, the story is engaging, the dialog is well-written (with some comedic moments and some emotional ones), the action scenes are creative and exciting and the score contributes significantly to the movie's overall quality, with its conjoining of musical styles from today with those from centuries ago. In short, this is a nearly perfect film which will likely entertain Movie Fans of any kingdom. ""A+""",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
71,mitsubishizero,Interesting take on a legend but confusing execution,5,31 October 2019,"People seem split on this movie so i'll give my two cents here: There're some cool fight scenes but some of the fast paced editing is confusing at times and does little to further the plot. The actors do a pretty good job with their respective roles but not enough time seems focused on them in terms of character development. The main antagonist is unsettling and pretty despicable. Basically after Arthur gets rescued his team tells him that he's the chosen one then proceed to train the reluctant hero in one of the fastest training montages ever.The music's pretty good and the cinematography is decent at times. As reinterpretations go it's very hit of miss to say the least. There're some great ideas but the way they're done seems on fast forward and with little development. I don't know how much time was put into it but that's just how it looks upon watching. If you like King Arthur than you'll find something interesting in it, otherwise you can skip this adaptation and leave it to be forgotten.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
72,MihaiSorinToma,A superb magical adventure,10,9 August 2017,"When the mighty Camelot, the last standing fortress of England, is attacked by dark magic forces, a small boy is sent by the river in order to survive. Many years later, in the same place ruled by a merciless king, the now grown boy is about to find out that there's much more to his ordinary life than he ever would have thought. He will find it very hard to accommodate with the idea, but he must do it fast as the whole kingdom's fate depends on his actions.It's a movie which presents the origins of Arthur, his life from the very beginning until his great deeds which eventually put him on England's throne. The whole story revolves around him and his evolution, presenting his adventures in uncovering his troubled past and his attempt to eliminate the evil that plagued their land for far too much. It presents a complex story, with twists, turns and unexpected events, gradually building up suspense and managing to keep the viewer interested until the end. It has an unique cinematic way, finding interesting angles and shooting positions which contribute to an increased sensation and thrill. Add some very engaging music to the equation and you end up with very exciting action scenes which are simply awesome. The very well rounded characters, excellently impersonated by the actors, play a huge role in creating this wonderful medieval scenario. Overall, it's a very impressive movie, very well thought and executed, which tells a solid story that might as well leave you breathless in many moments. It's a must see for those who seek an adventure full of magic and action, as this one is.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
73,swilliky,Awfully boring and confusing fantasy,3,14 May 2017,"An origin tale that was hoping to spark many further sequel and spinoffs turns out to be an utterly boring disappointment that hardly makes sense. Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) is caught up in a memory of his father Uther (Eric Bana) dying as he dreams about it every night. The movie constantly flashes back to this moment about ten times too many showing the same thing over and over, possibly with a little detail added to show that Arthur is coming to terms with his father's death. Arthur had to escape as a young boy because his father was the king but was betrayed by his brother Vortigern (Jude Law). I'm not sure how closely this is following the actual legend of King Arthur but there were some tall elephants that smashed stuff. This opening battle sequence is the only battle sequence in the whole film and possibly the best part.Arthur quickly grows up in a brothel in a rapid montage scene. I wish more of the movie went this fast because any time they stop and talk, the film becomes so boring that I would take off my 3D glasses and try to catch a quick nap. Arthur has a group of friends that viewers are supposed to like but I didn't really care especially as later the death of one is supposed to be the emotional climax that leads Arthur to pick up the sword. It is never clear why Arthur doesn't want the immense power of the sword in the stone but he spends a major portion of this second act fainting every time he touches it.

74,markthomassintek,"Effects are amazing, the opening with the huge ........ Wow.",8,17 August 2017,"REVIEW - KING ARTHUR LEGEND OF THE SWORDBefore I review the film I just want to get something off my chest. British films when shown at the cinema only get a limited run of about a week where as American films get 2, 3 or 4 weeks, why?Take I Daniel Blake, one of the films of the decade and was shown for a week in selected cinemas. British actors, special effects, costume, make-up ETC are the best in the world, employed by America studios but why do British films get small showings in this our country?This is what happened with King Arthur, I missed it at the cinema as it was on for a week so have only had the opportunity to watch it now and I so wish I had seen it at the cinema.Critic's slated the film, as they always seem to do these days with British mare films but honestly I really enjoyed it.Great interpretation of the legend of King Arthur with a gripping story and characters especially Blue and his father.Effects are amazing, the opening with the huge ........

75,redrobin62-321-207311,"Sorry, But This Movie IS Worth Your Time.",8,12 August 2018,"I get it that Guy Ritchie, et. al., didn't set about to correct history by presenting a historical account of King Arthur. Let's face it, there is no way the largess presented in this expensive production could have taken place. That said, I appreciate the movie for what it is - two hours of inspirational entertainment.If you're a fan of medieval folklore and European fairy tales like I am, then you can appreciate the references throughout, from mages to sword-wielding kings to damsels in distress to undersea dragons (or whatever that three-headed thing in the water was). Fantasy/Lord of the Rings addicts will see a lot to like here. I did, and I enjoyed myself.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
76,abisio,The best BLOCKBUSTER as of May 2017,9,19 May 2017,"Let's be frank; 2017 has been a terrible year for big blockbusters pictures. LOGAN was depressing, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST cannot be compared to the animated original (director should be expelled from the movie world), GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is half as funny as first one. Basically; there is no originality at all (excluding LOGAN which I would preferred to be a repetitive WOLVERINE movie instead of the tragedy it is). Guy Ritchie (ex- Mr. Madonna and the creator of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and most recently Sherlock Holmes), has crafted another of this crazy movies using his usual tricks that are plenty of fun. Kings Arthur, Legend of the Sword is a curios movie. It is not particularly serious or over dramatic to tragedy (considering is a British tale). There are plenty of spectacular scenes; but instead of sword fights Ritchie favors big mass movements, collective fights and foot running action. British style humor mind games played in images are usual Director's trademarks and he perfectly knows how to use them and when making more enjoyable moments taking down the seriousness of the situations.Acting is superb. Ritchie gives enough screen time to every secondary character; making the movie more live, interesting and funnier (some of the small parts are quite good). Individually; Jude Law is perfect as the ""bad guy"". He really looks like a greedy usurper. He can be terrifying and likable at the same time (like a snake). Hunnam's Arthur has been given a scoundrel background story which fits him and the character. He is far from perfect and not always likable.I was really surprised Djimon Hounsou and Astrid Bergès-Frisbey had too little to do in the movie being such important to the story. This and the unnecessary use of digital images are the only two drawbacks of the movie. In brief: It is wonderful way to expend two hours.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
77,bob-the-movie-man,The Arthurian legend: but with Cockneys.,7,11 May 2017,"The quirky style of Guy Ritchie isn't one that you would think would translate well to the Arthurian setting, and as the film starts you tend to think you were right! But if you give it a chance it wears you down into acceptance and then - ultimately - a lot of enjoyment.Jude Law is deliciously evil mixed with a heavy dose of mad, and delivers the goods. Charlie Hunnam who plays Arthur (no, I hadn't heard of him either but he was in the ""Lost City of Z"") does a decent job as the medieval hunk, although he seems at time to have taken voice coaching in 'Olde-English' from Russell Crowe, since the lad's Geordie accent seems to wander from Cockney through central southern England to Liverpudlian at one point (definitely channelling a young John Lennon)! Relative newcomer, the Spanish actress Astrid Bergès- Frisbey is effectively weird as the mage.Particularly noteworthy (no pun intended) is the superb action soundtrack by Daniel Pemberton (""Steve Jobs"", ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."") which propels the action really well and contains some standout moments.Also a standout in the technical categories is the editing by James Herbert, who did both of Downey Junior's ""Sherlock Holmes"" films (in a similar style) and also ""Edge of Tomorrow"". The style is typified with Arthur's growth to manhood in the streets of London which is stylishly done. I saw the film in 3D - not a particularly favourite format, but quite well done. Though rather in the ""trying too hard"" category with lots of fires and drifting embers... you know the sort.It's not bloody Shakespeare. It's not even the bloody Arthurian legend as you know it. But it is bloody good fun. (I added some high comedy to this review with a strong Cockney angle, but boring old IMDb said it had too many spelling mistakes!!

Very obviously directed by Guy Ritchie, this film has the usual Guy Ritchie feel and style of fast editing and witty banter. The story is of the hero's journey from childhood to king. A little bit of Lord of the Rings. A little bit of Harry Potter. Very heavy on CGI.Jude Law is the standout evil scumbag king, but Charlie Hunnam is just an OK 'King' character, what this was really missing was Tom Hardy as the King (OMG how was he not the obvious choice after the BBC TV TABOO series) and finally, David Beckham should probably stick to football. The music score was excellent and perfectly atmospheric. So in summary, this is an entertaining film, not really great but not bad either, worth a view in 3D.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
80,anselmdaniel,Ambitious but rushed,6,16 August 2021,"This review contains spoilers.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is an adventure movie that is based on the Arthurian legend. The movie is directed by Guy Ritchie and features an ensemble cast.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a messy movie. From the beginning, the movie hinted at a grand scale of adventure. For the most part, the movie delivers in this aspect. However, the movie fails to make the audience care. The overall story did not make the audience care for the side characters which had aspects that the audience can find interesting. There is a running plot thread where most of the kingdom dislike the villain played by Jude Law, however the rebellion is firmly in Arthur's court. There was not a grand rebellion but instead it was a hero's journey.The side characters were not given much running time to be explored. The movie hopes that the audience can understand them from brief moments. I do not think that this was enough for the audience to appreciate and look into the depth of the characters. Aiden Gillian portrays a shifty rogue that sabotages a plan for King Arthur. The only plot point that comes out of this is one of Arthur's friends dies. The movie could have done much better in developing these plot points and instead they became contrivances.The action scenes are impressive however they felt visually dark. I felt that the darkness prevented the audience from noticing many flaws in the computer generated imagery. Overall the visuals are still decent and helped the movie.Overall the movie is enjoyable. The dialogue is written in classic Guy Ritchie style where the audience can have a fun adventure across the nearly two hours of running time.I would recommend ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"".Grade: C.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
81,msbreviews,Rating: B,7,6 August 2017,"I have been pretty late on my reviews so when I went to check how the ratings were for this film, I was pretty disappointed because I thought it would actually be a great movie. Since I usually tend to agree with most critics on whether a film is ""good"", ""mixed"" or ""bad"", my expectations going into the theater weren't high ... Maybe because of that, I really enjoyed King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and I'm completely on the other side of the critics' general opinions.The first act might actually be my favorite. The intro is visually stunning, action-packed, filmed almost seamlessly and the initial story (the one that almost everyone knows) is told in a unique and fast- paced way, a well-known feature of Guy Ritchie's direction techniques.The story becomes captivating as we go along without ever feeling boring or dragged. The humor used throughout the runtime is a welcome addition to the remake as well as the amount of magic that didn't exist that much on the previous film. The soundtrack feels surprisingly addictive (it's very loud and it has a strong beat) which elevated the action scenes to an entertaining level (since these are probably my main issue with the movie).The whole cast does a great job, but I have to praise Charlie Hunnam's work. He's been under several bad reviews from some critics and even though he's not the greatest actor ever, he's still really, really good overall and in this film, he's absolutely great! Jude Law is also a great over-the-top antagonist and Astrid Bergès- Frisbey (The Mage) is such an amazing surprise, she's really fantastic.As for flaws, this movie isn't near perfection whatsoever in the technical subjects. The action scenes, which are supposed to be one of the main sources of entertainment, are incredibly choppy and the CGI used overpowers the few choreographed sequences, especially the last one that looks more like a video game.The editing isn't as smooth as it should have been which didn't help the storytelling's transitions. Despite Guy Ritchie's decisions regarding the main plot being mostly fine, there's one that I still can't understand after thinking a lot about it: there's one part of the film that he basically ""skips"" due to his storytelling's techniques that could have been the most awesome action-packed moment of the entire runtime. With some adjustments here and there, I'm sure that this huge scene had space to shine in this film without extending it too much.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword deserves way more than what the critics are rating. The action scenes are underwhelmed by the excessive use of CGI and the choppy editing (which is also present throughout the rest of the movie), and some of Ritchie's decisions regarding the main plot are questionable. However, a powerful, action-packed first act with some beautiful visuals and uniquely fast storytelling (characteristic of Guy Ritchie portfolio of techniques), plus an addictive score and some excellent performances from Charlie Hunnam and Astrid Bergès-Frisbey, turn this film into a great entertainment.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Charlie, it's not that it's bad, it's that the paper is big, it does not have the strength that paper requires. Jude, with what I like, does not carry the paper well.This director, who has never liked me, has never known how to use slow motion. He uses it untimely, where he should not and when he says nothing. There are many moments in which the film becomes a pin pong game of short shots as if it were advertising, but it is an adventure movie.
There is one thing that I liked, I will comment on the spoiler zone
The action scenes, which are many, are so badly rolled that you have to wait for it to end, to see what happened. There is only a moment in which something is perceived of what happens.The effects are very well done, but since you're tired of the movie, it does not matter.It has a photograph that could be improved. With the money you manage, I'm sure you can make it more beautiful and get more into that much.With all the scenarios that will have prepared to shoot it and then having the effects I think it does not take advantage of what it has. it's like I do not know how to shoot itI would not waste time watching this movie, I'm sure you appreciate it.Spoiler:
What I liked is the idea of how Eric dies, throws the sword into the air, kneels down so that that God who is Excalibur will cross him waiting for another selected one and sink into the water and become stone.

86,Laakbaar,Crap,5,30 May 2017,"I didn't like this movie.This film has little to no connection to either British history or the Arthurian legend. I wasn't in the mood to put up with yet another fantasy world and idiosyncratic mock interpretation of history (a la Monty Python or Tarantino). The anachronisms and anatopisms disturbed me, especially the accents. Was that a Chinese man in 6th century Britain teaching martial arts?Does every historical movie now have to be turned into a fantasy action film? It was all just made-up sh*t: a ""mage"" who controls the animals, the blade has to touch the altar, Vortigern has a freaky evil thing going on, slithery octopus-women...it just went on and on.I disliked the fact that I had to pay close attention to figure out what was going on. The dialogue (consisting essentially of macho bantering) was really annoying. I'm not at all into laddism. Was this movie meant to appeal to 14-year-old British chavs addicted to video-game action and violence? This movie was told from the perspective of...what?...a Cockney footballer? A Geordie thug? The move was melodramatic, to the point that I groaned audibly when the boy's scream was echoed throughout the city. Everything was momentous and slickly cool and kept at a high pitch. I disliked the artificial slow-mos and fast-forwarding.It all just seemed very much like LOTR or every other fantasy film you've seen lately. Giant elephants, I mean, c'mon. Action for action's sake, which I hate. This wasn't a movie with character development of the kind that I recognize. I just didn't care about these people. Men bantering with each other is not character development. It's just annoying posturing.Three of the hottest guys on the planet were in the movie, but it wasn't a sexy movie.I fell asleep for about 30 minutes in the first half. It just was too confusing. Who the f*ck is Vortigern? Who the f*ck is Uther? None of it was properly explained. Fortunately I awoke just in time to see him pulling out the sword. The fire alarm in the cinema went off about 20 minutes before the ending. I was grateful for the opportunity to escape, and I didn't care about how it ended.When I look at the list of movies Ritchie has made, I realise I don't like Guy Ritchie movies.OK, there were a few creative, thought-provoking and interesting visuals and scenes, I'll give Ritchie that. There is enough there to make me think that maybe I didn't really understand or get the director's style. I'm thinking of going back to give it another chance. Maybe my review is unfair. Maybe I just didn't get it.A puzzle to me: why did I like ""The Great Wall"", but not this? They are cut from the same cloth.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
87,CANpatbuck3664,King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a Mixed Bag but it Has Definite Strengths That Shouldn't be Overlooked,7,17 May 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie beings at the start of a big battle. The Mage army is smashing through King Uther's defences. Uther (Eric Bana) decides to take the battle into his own hands, despite his brother Vortigern's (Jude Law) reservations. Uther jumps onto the leading war elephant and slays the Mage king, ending the battle. After the battle, there are conflicting arguments on how to deal with the fallout. Previously the feuding kingdoms lived in harmony so some of Uther's generals: Bedivere (Djimon Hounsou) and Bill (Aidan Gillen) want to seek peace while Vortigern proposes hunting down the Mages and killing them. Uther agrees that a temporary peace should be reached and while some leave the meeting happy, others are angry and will not back down. Uther senses this and packs up his wife and his son Arthur (later played by Charlie Hunnam) to leave the castle at night.If you've looked at the reviews for this movie, they're really scathing. I would never argue that this movie is a complete success but critics have been too quick to slam this movie. There's some really good stuff in here. I tend to like most of Guy Ritchie's movies and one of the biggest reasons is that his characters have tons of camaraderie. This is often helped by some stellar dialogue too. They make you laugh but it also helps you believe in the relationships between the characters. That was the strongest part of King Arthur for me. My favourite scenes weren't the big action set pieces, they were the parts where Arthur and his crew were taking care of business in Londinium or sabotaging the villain's operation. Other than the occasional slip up with modern day phrasing (I don't think anyone said razzle-dazzle in the medieval ages?) it reminded me of Jason Statham's dialogue in Snatch. It was generally solid and I laughed throughout the movie.Guy Ritchie has been at this long enough that he's developed his own way doing action. In some of his projects it works great (Sherlock Holmes has some really great action scenes) and in other projects it doesn't. I thought the actions scenes in Legend of the Sword were good in some areas and they weren't so great in others. I saw this with a friend and she said the action reminded her of video games. She's not wrong. When Arthur uses Excalibur, its like unlocking a special ability in a video game. The CGI is decent (it better be with a $175 million budget) but the movie also can't seem to decide how far into fantasy it wants to go. So the action is a mixed bag, the ending goes too crazy but it didn't affect the overall grade too much.The acting is also pretty mixed. I actually really liked Charlie Hunnam as Arthur. He's had a tough road transitioning to movies but he had the charisma and the right physicality to pull this role off. I also really liked some of the actors in supporting parts: Aiden Gillan, Djimon Hounsou, Neil Maskell and Kingsley Ben-Adir are all respectively funny and they were believable as a crew. Getting into some of the performances I didn't like as much, I don't want to blame Jude Law because he was trying but Vortigern was a lacklustre character for me. I also thought Astrid Bergès-Frisbey was weak. Her character seemed like something that could have been cut out and she was really wooden as The Mage.This movie reminds me of 2 other Warner Bros. releases from last year that had a mixed measure of success; The Legend of Tarzan and Suicide Squad. Both of those movie were completely trashed by critics and were flawed products. But they also had some really cool parts and strong aspects that people just threw aside when judging the movie. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword falls into that category for me. The action is mixed, the acting is mixed and the story takes some pretty big liberties from the King Arthur legend and the historical period. But you have some great dialogue, interesting characters, a decent leading performance and some big action set pieces that are impressive. This wasn't the train wreck that I expected and if you're interested in seeing this, don't be afraid to give it a shot. I would be closer to a 6.5/10 but I'll round up to a 7/10.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

89,SquigglyCrunch,A Modern Film Style Placed Over a Fantastical Setting Somehow Works Out,9,24 May 2017,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a retelling of the story of King Arthur, unsurprisingly. It follows a young boy as he is separated from his parents and raised outside of his kingdom. When he pulls the king's sword from the stone, the current king learns who he is and sets out to stop him from claiming his place as king. The movie is very much a fantasy with a medieval setting, but it blends modern aspects into it as well. And surprisingly they all work. The costumes aren't your typical medieval attire, yet they still fit the world that the movie has built well enough not to be glaring. And the music is similar. It's exciting and not as medieval-sounding as one may expect, but again it works. And more specifically, the directing style which is much more modern and fast-paced, works perfectly with King Arthur. A lot of scenes are made a lot better by Guy Ritchie's style actually. Near the beginning of the movie there's a montage showing Arthur growing up, and it's shot in such a way that the audience can tell what's happening and learns something about the main character while keeping it fast and interesting. There's a mini plot line that goes on in the montage, and it's all shot in such a way that it isn't boring to watch, unlike other montages or showing-the-progression- of-time tactics. Apart from the directing, the acting is pretty good as well. Jude Law in particular stands out as a king with evil intentions, but he still maintains a level of humanity. So no matter who's side your on, you can't help but feel for his character. And even without that, he's still a solid, subtle villain. Charlie Hunnam does a good job as Arthur as well, though not as much as his villainous counterpart. The performance of Astrid Bergès-Frisbey as the mage stands out in that she's rather dull. Her acting is flat and monotone, but she's consistent enough that it's clear that that's the character she's going for, so it isn't unbearable to see her on screen. There's one scene in this movie (basically the entire second act) that I found to be particularly exciting. Ritchie's distinct directing style shines here once again, and it's both fun and engaging. It proves that the movie is willing to take some risks, and while the fact that the scene happens is a little formulaic, it's still an awesome scene. Speaking of excitement, the movie as a whole is just that. The action is well choreographed and well-shot, and it's just plain fun. It was shot in such a way that it wasn't difficult to tell what was going on, but still maintained a fast pace and a level of urgency, and it was just plain awesome to watch. As whole, King Arthur still follows a formula unfortunately. And while that isn't glaringly obvious while watching the movie, it's still present after the fact. Overall King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is fantastic. The directing, acting, action, and distinctive style all make it one of the better movies I've seen as of late. While it does follow a formula, it isn't bothersome enough to ruin the movie. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
90,mjsreg,Positive reviews from Richie fans only. Movie is tripe,1,18 May 2017,"I like films about King Arthur and have done ever since being a child many, many years ago. I find it interesting to see different takes on a classic legend from my part of the world.However, this movie is the ONLY one I have seen where I have cringed from beginning to end.It is big - has lots of CGI - and that is about the only thing I can say about it.The story is ridiculous and the acting is worse than imagining Daffy Duck perform Shakespeare (although that would be far more entertaining).Then there is the awful, dreadful, dire, and ridiculous appearance by David Beckham. It does not follow that because Beckham is a mate of Richie's that he can act - he obviously can not - and will never be able to.Of the thousands and thousands of films I have seem in my lifetime there are very, very few I would like to get a refund for if I could. This is one of them.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
91,destroyerwod,There is a movie in my CGI...,6,5 September 2020,"Sometimes we can say there is CGI in our movies. In this case, we can say there is a movie in our CGI. Seriously this movie is HEAVY on CGI to a point where its getting hard to suspend disbelief. Now granted its pretty well made and some scenes do look impressive.Ill be honest, i found this movie in the Walmart bargain bin. I had just started Sons of Anarchy so since the main actor, Charlie Hunnam was the lead in SOA and i enjoy medieval movies i said oh why not.Then i watched a trailer on youtube and realized what it is, not realistic one bit, lots of CGI etc so i put it side. Lately i finished SOA and remembered i still had that movie in my backlog so i gave it a shot.Honestly its not a bad movie by any mean, it does let itself get watch fine, but i just wished there would had been more character developement on the side characters, more gritty realistic fights, and less fantasy. Maybe its the concept of using something known like the legend of Athur , maybe if it was a totally original plot/character, i would had gotten easier behind. I dunno.I had a decent time with it, for 5$ its alright, but i doubt ill rewatch it. It will probably go into that box of DVDs i bough cheap, watched, and couldn't care much to see again but since DVDs are not worth anything anymore, i just keep them for collection purpose.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
92,thekingsdom,Watchable,5,8 December 2019,"If you're bored, this is an ok watch. It's a tad cheesy and the script and dialogue is a bit dodge but overall it's ok. 5/10 does it for me.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
93,PyroSikTh,'I'm not doing the thing.' Does the thing.,7,23 May 2017,"The very first thing to note is that this is Guy Ritchie's version of King Arthur. And Guy Ritchie does what Guy Ritchie does best. This is a medieval fantasy epic literally in the tone of a British gangster flick, particularly Ritchie's gangster flicks like Lock Stock, Snatch and RocknRolla. I'll admit, this idea didn't exactly enthral me. I enjoy those Ritchie movies, and I enjoy medieval fantasy epics, but a mix of the two just sounded like putting pineapple on a pizza; a combination that should just never work under any circumstance. Unlike pineapple pizza though, this did somehow work, and it worked really well.Let me explain. King Arthur is a British myth, following British characters, in Britain. Not only that, but Arthur was an orphan raised on the streets before being found and guided by Merlin to becoming the king we all know and love. That means when he was younger, he was working class; a common-as-muck geezer getting down and dirty in the streets of peasants. You know, yeah, I can see the common tongue becoming his native language in that circumstance, and Legend of the Sword plays on that and makes it work brilliantly.The other big staple of Ritchie's movie-making, along with snappy dialogue and British- infused slang, is a barrage of quick cuts and flashbacks filling in gaps from a story flow that is less than chronological. Legend of the Sword has that too. It has it in spades. In fact it maybe does it a little too much, and the flashbacks sometimes don't even add much other than explaining why his hands are tied or something as minuscule as that. This shake up of the movie's chronology is simultaneously refreshing in a blockbuster movie of this size, and a jumbled mess as the narrative jumps and jolts all over the place. It's easy enough to follow, but it results in certain sequences lacking necessary development, and the feeling that the movie is just a series of montages.Then there's the humour, which is another trademark of Ritchie's. While it is certainly an amusing movie, and the snappy dialogue offers some delightfully entertaining exchanges between characters, some of the jokes run a bit tired. Multiple times they rely on the comedy hook of ""That's not happening"" followed immediately by whatever it is happening. For instance Arthur figured that the group are baiting him into a fight so he'll grab the sword, and says to them that he's not going to fall for it; he's not, under any circumstance, going to fight them. Followed immediately by punching one of them in the face and getting into a fight. I mean it's funny the first few times, but after a while it wears thin. ""I'm not taking him to the place"" jump cut to them on a boat ""welcome to the place"".Acting isn't too bad across the board, particularly Charlie Hunnam, who I frankly haven't enjoyed in anything. In everything I've seen him in so far, he's come off flat, uninteresting, and completely unnatural. Here he seems to be playing himself and feels much more at ease. He brings this blokey version of Arthur to life and makes him believable and oddly charming. The rest of the supporting cast is good too. Eric Bana doesn't get a whole lot to do, but is suitably kingly and a little bit of a badass to boot. Jude Law plays up the antagonist role really well, and manages to give him a sympathetic edge, but lacks a little bit of development to make him a truly memorable foe. Djimon Honsou, Aiden Gillen, Astrid Bergés-Frisbey, Michael McElhatton, Peter Ferdinando, Neil Maskell, Tom Wu, Geoff Bell, and even David Beckham (believe it or not) all have their brief, but underdeveloped moments, but these actors are literally just here to support the leads and propel the story forward.The visuals are pretty fantastic, from the settings, set designs, and costuming to the grand CGI. Londinium and Camelot are hugely interesting places with a character of their own, and an action sequence through the streets of Londinium is certainly a highlight of the movie thanks to how fleshed out this city feels. The giant war elephants that open the movie are a sight to behold, as are the tentacled syrens Vortigern consults, while the CGI eagle and giant snake are maybe a little too obviously not real.Daniel Pemberton's score though. Wow. The music is a massive part of this movie, not just underlying and adding emphasis to the movie, but becoming it's own entity entirely. It's big and bombastic, while simultaneously medieval in sound and feel, with interesting instrument choices and rhythms carrying the film forward. A mix of acoustic guitars, raw cellos, pumping drums, and even rhythmic breathing create a rich tapestry of sonic beauty.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword isn't a great movie by any means. It's pacing is all over the place, it's ending a little rushed, important plot points are rushed through, and the chronological jumps are equally interesting and messy at the same time. The plot is great, and it's general tone will mark it as a unique film in the blockbuster landscape, but narratively it falls behind, and it's characters are a little lacking. Despite all that, it's just solidly good fun, with some impressive visuals and a heart- pounding score that's worth the price of admission alone. I give Legend of the Sword a generous 7/10, because it really was good fun, despite it's flaws.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

95,p-jonsson,Different but entertaining Pendragon saga.,8,30 December 2017,"These days have been a bit of a movie marathon with the kids being here since the 24th so we have made quite a dent in the to-watch shelf of my movie collection.Yesterday it was time for some rehashing of the Pendragonian legends in the form of King Arthur: The Legend of the Sword. Usually I find it dangerous business to mess with classical and well proven stories. Do not fix what is not broken and all that. I did, however, find this rehash quite entertaining.The base of the story is of course, and thankfully, the same: Uther is killed, Excalibur ends up in a stone, Arthur pulls Excalibur out of the stone, lots of swordfights, Arthur becomes king. The details of that story is rehashed quite a lot though.The movie opens up with some fairly cool action where Uther combats Mordred (yes Mordred already in the opening scenes, as I said, rehash...) who attacks Camelot with black magic and king-sized (pun intended) combat elephants. I cannot say too much about what happens without spoiling a lot but the sword ends up in the stone and Arthur ends up...somewhere else.So already from the start the movie asserted two things, that it is a different take on the Pendragon saga and that it is fairly heavy on action, black magic and special effects. I was a bit worried about the rehashing of the saga bit at this point but, as you have already deduced from the above, overall I quite enjoyed the movie.The movie proceeds by showing us Arthur growing up in a bit more misery than the traditional stories do but it does so in more or less fast forward mode and we arrive rather quickly to the point were Arthur pulls out the sword from the stone.This is were I have a bit of a gripe with the movie. This moment felt a bit anticlimactic and even disappointing. There was not big moment of awe just confusion. As the movie blurb hints at, Arthur is neither ready nor willing to become a king. So at this point everyone has to go through the hassle of convincing him. I rarely like this reluctant hero concept. Boring!Luckily Arthur has a merry band of friends to help him chose the right path and this is were the movie spends quite a bit of time. With Arthur as a bit of a Robin Hood in the woods and him and his compadres nibbling at Vortigern's heels. Of course every so often Arthur is nudged towards his destiny and the action when he decides, well is forced is perhaps more correct, to pick up Excalibur it becomes a bit of an FX feast.In terms of acting and characters I would say that they all made a fairly good job of it. Arthur himself is stuck with the reluctant hero role, which I am not too found of as I wrote before, but he is doing a decent enough job of it. Vortigern is not bad as the chief bad guy. I did like the mage although most of the time she was looking into the distance and flapping her eyelids. That is when things were happening though. You do NOT want this gal to flip her eyelids at you!Naturally everything was slowly building up towards the big bada boum between Arthur and Vortigern and, again, I think this was fairly well done. Lots of action, lots of magic and lots of FX. I really enjoyed how things played out at the end and all the visuals. One thing that I did like more with this version of the story, okay bit of a spoiler ahead, is that it did not end as tragically as the usual King Arthur story.Bottom line, if you are set in stone as to what the Pendragon saga should be then watch another movie. If not and you're up for some nice fantasy action adventure in the Pendragon universe you might like this movie. I did!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
96,EthanBJones_03,Why was David Beckham in this movie again?,7,31 May 2017,"'KING ARTHUR: LEGEND OF THE SWORD' was directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Charlie Hunham, Jude Law and Djimon Houson. ​After the murder of his father, young Arthur's power-hungry uncle Vortigern seizes control of the crown. Robbed of his birthright, he grows up the hard way in the back alleys of the city, not knowing who he truly is. When fate leads him to pull the Excalibur sword from stone, Arthur embraces his true destiny to become a legendary fighter and leader.I think that critics are being way too harsh on this movie. Is it messy? Yes. Is the climax disappointing? Yes. Is it fun as hell to watch? Hell yes. This movie is a dumb, stupid time supported by two stellar performances and Guy Ritchie's awesome direction. It's Guy Ritchie at the height of his power and don't let the critics tell you otherwise. The action is, for the most part, epic and badass to behold. As stated previously, there are some pretty great performances from Charlie Hunham and Jude Law, as well as Djimon Houson and even a totally useful cameo, from David Beckham. That said, the story is were this movie fails. It's bloated, messy and I believe that Guy Ritchie wanted to make it a 3 hour epic but was cut back by the studio. Some pretty important scenes are just completely glossed over and they really try to rush through this movie. If this movie was three hours long, I think it would have been a much better movie and would have given Ritchie more freedom to make it more fleshed out and clean.This movie's main strength is the stellar cast. Charlie Hunham is excellent as Arthur and really lets his charisma shine. On the flip side of that, Arthur's arc was incredibly messy and made little to no sense. Jude Law was also great as King Vortigen and managed to be a genuinely sinister villain that inspired actual fear in the audience. He was hateful and likable and creepy as hell, and a very entertaining villain. Supporting these two powerhouse performances were Djimon Houson's Sir Bedivere, Aidan Gillen's Goosefat Bill and Astrid Burges-Frisby's 'The Mage'. All of these actors provided satisfying performances but I think were underdeveloped, especially Astrid Burges-Frisby. Again, I take this fault to my theory of what Ritchie wanted to do, and will leave it at that.Guy Ritchie's iconic style and editorial patterns shine bright in this movie and the inner Ritchie was released. All the Guy Ritchie- isms you know and love are present and he makes this movie very artistically and visually enticing. It's a very good looking movie and the set design is very recognisable. While the CGI was pretty impressive to look at, it was very overused towards the final act and became blatantly annoying and took you out of the movie. Another awesome thing this movie had was a badass score. Daniel Pemberton's awesome score resonates through this movie and the soundtrack is very special and enjoyable to listen to.The action for this movie was really good but the focus of CGI became very annoying and apparent towards the final act. The climax was also incredibly weak and felt unbelievably rushed. While this movie does start of slow, it is entertaining enough to warrant a watch and contains enough good humour to make me give it a very solid and surprising 7 out of 10 pointless cameos.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

98,coreyjdenford,Excalibur Unrising,4,19 May 2017,"This review of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is spoiler free** (2/5)YOU CAN'T BLAME Guy Ritchie for blending his own style of mayhem with the Arthurian legend. It's not the first time he has done this - a year before Benedict Cumberbatch dived us into Sherlock's immense Mind Palace - we had Ritchie's version of Sherlock Holmes played by Robert Downey Jr. - it was a sterling effort by the director (with $534 million in the box-office).So, in theory, his tone on the myth-cum-legend-story should be easy for him. And for a time it occasionally sparkles - in the opening there's a giant CG elephant stamping through armies, through Eric Bana's current monarch King Uther claiming the throne from his jealous brother, the tyrannical Vortigern (Jude Law) who wants the throne for himself, to a montage of our legendary character, Arthur (Charlie Hunnam), growing from a child to crowing stature. The opening sequence is enthralling - more notably the enormous Pachyderm stamping through Camelot. Stepping into the fantasy genre after that Lord of the Rings-esque moment, there are mages (mystical beings that command animals), and the legendary sword, Excalibur, with an ultimate power under its hilt. The first act sparkles, for a while tagging along another stunning moment - Arthur lifting the sword from the stone shoots tingles - and so, with that in mind King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a success. Unfortunately, the middle section of the film is when the success of the first act falters, Ritchie's direction is at fault here - it's uneven the disposable plot and the generic effects which he relies on too much for staggering effect - this quickly dwindles from stunning to flat-out over-used. In addition to that it's bogged down by the shaky editing, which looks like the effect Sherlock used to fight enemies - unevenly matched with Daniel Pemberton's loud original score and the worst celebrity cameo in years.On the bright side the leads (Hunnam and Law) look like they are having a good time - it's a sterling performance from the both of them. Hunnam plays the part of a muscle-clad Arthur who grows up in a brothel until he lifts the sword and learns his true legacy. Law plays the opposite to what he is used to, he plays the role of a tyrannical king who does anything for power until Arthur gets in his way. Both working as the saving grace but after the generic middle section it's not enough to save the film.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword fails to deliver its promise of a success from genre busting director Ritchie, in this Snatchelot interpretation that's too uneven to merit a franchise.VERDICT: Boasts sterling performances from its two talented leads and legendary subject matter that sparkles on occasion before being scuppered by generic effects, conflicting ideas and an uneven story.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
99,Ramascreen,It's King Arthur through Guy Ritchie's filters,6,9 May 2017,"The biggest problem with #KingArthur #LegendOfTheSword is that it puts more emphasis on trying to be a Guy Ritchie superhero film than it is about King Arthur. I understand that mythically, Arthur's sword supposedly bears powers of its own, but this films makes its effects work the same way spinach boosts Popeye's strength. Another problem is that instead of watching a movie, some of the time it feels more like you're watching ""Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor"" video game walkthrough.Charlie Hunnam stars as the born king, Arthur whose father is murdered as Arthur's uncle, Vortigern (Jude Law) seizes the crown. The film traces Arthur's journey from the brothel life all the way to the throne. Robbed of his birthright, Arthur pulls the sword from the stone and finds himself become the king's threat number one.At the very least, ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" does have a clear story, so this is not as messy or as incoherent as a Zack Snyder presentation by any stretch of the imagination. And if you're a die hard Guy Ritchie fan, this too carries his usual brute montage style that often explains a subplot in a very quick, very humorous manner, so in that sense, it is a more dynamic film than any of the other versions of King Arthur you've seen on the screen.Charlie Hunnam essentially plays a reluctant hero who's having difficulties coming to terms with his destiny but after a while, his continued reluctance becomes frustrating and downright annoying. Not to mention the fact that for whatever reason, this film is so obsessed with wasting time on VFX hallucinations and pointless creatures, there really is no good reason why this film's runtime has to be 126 minutes long. And the supporting characters aren't well-developed either which is why you'd get easily stoked at David Beckham's easily spotted cameo. Jude Law is probably this film's only redeeming quality, as the villain, Law is as incredible and reliable as he's ever been which makes his character, Vortigern, a formidable foe. Overall, I'm not saying that ""King Arthur: Legend of The Sword"" is not an entertaining film if you're a style-over-substance kind of an audience, but just be aware that you'll be viewing Arthur through Guy Ritchie's filters.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

This movie is very fast paced and because of that reason the story is confusing, you see the characters move around from place to place with little to no reason, it doesn't make it easier with the terrible dialog.Characters: 1/10Arthur: Arthur was stolen of his birthright, and he was raised by prostitutes, he then pulled the sword out of the rock that proving he is the king.That's basically it, there is no character development except some clips of him growing up.The Mage: The Mage is the one that is supposed to help Arthur through his journey, and she does it well, but you don't even get to know the character, you don't even get to know her name.Vortigern: Vortigern is the evil king and he will not stop at anything to stay as king, this character gets a little more character development then the others, so I guess he's the best character.I couldn't talk more about the other characters because they had no character development and no bonding with the other characters.Action: 2/10The CGI is decent at best and it is entertaining, but the biggest issue is the music, I'm OK with music, but if it's playing 90% of the time it gets annoying.I have never seen a movie this terrible, and I hate to give movies such low rating, but this movie is beyond anything I have ever seen, don't watch this movie.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

104,kermitkid,Guy Ritchie is still great!,8,30 March 2020,"Why do we give Rotten Tomatoes so much credibilty? There are plenty of movies that have recieved low scores that I ended up really liking and this is one of them. Do not listen to the critics. I think the reason so many were quick to hate this film is that it is a little too fast paced. There aren't really any quiet moments to give the audience a few minutes to catch their breath and comprehend what they just watched up to that point and that is one way the film could have been improved. But as far as story goes, I really enjoyed it. Although at times I did see a lot of similarities to ""The Force Awakens"" and ''Rogue One"", but Star Wars is basically sci-fi fantasy anyway, just as this is medeval Star Wars. Charlie Hunnam is great in the title role, but for me Jude Law and Aidan Gillen really stole the show. Law's great at playing villains and this is another example of that. He's so chilling. Aidan Gillen wasn't necessarily a ""comic relief"" character, but a few of his lines did get some laughs out of me. The action sequences in this film are so elaborate and well-done, however there are moments where it's painfully obvious CGI was used instead of actors, and it's not even good CGI. It looks like a trailer for a video game from 2004. A lot more of the budget should have gone to improving the CGI, because as quickly as I was enthralled by the action sequences, I was just as quickly taken out of them, and that kind of ruined the final battle for me. I also absolutely must praise the score! My goodness was this an awesome score! I loved Daniel Pemberton's work on ""The Man from UNCLE"" and the score here as just as epic. I can listen to this soundtrack for hours. It really gets you pumped for whatever action sequence or battle is about to happen. If you're about to hit the gym, put on this soundtrack. Trust me, it will help you. This was a great fantasty/action film. If ""Stardust"" was Guy Ritchie's fantasy movie for women, this is definetly his fantasy movie for men. Defintely should ignore Rotten Tomatoes with this one.

Fake acting set to panic music.Fake acting, looking pretty, virtue signalling, slow motion, panic music, cliche lines, acting so bad it looks like the character is lying which breaks the movie.

106,ayoreinf,Is this the beginning of a new Hollywood franchise?,8,15 May 2017,"I'm not going to dwell long over the plot itself. After the Audacity of Antoine Fuqua and co at 2004, when they declared their pseudo historic version is ""The Untold True Story That Inspired The Legend"", none can complain. King Arthur is obviously the biggest English myth, and has more than one version, so it does allow for some literary liberty regarding the plot line. This one took it very far, Not as far as the 2004 version did, but since they never claimed to present us with the true version, how can we complain.If we're not dwelling on the plot, that does leave a lot to be desired, the rest is fairly well done. The acting is professional by most. The recent Hollywood tendency for multiracial cast even at a period when multiracial presence was unlikely, is repeated here, but it's a fantasy, so let's imagine it was possible. As I already said, nobody is trying to sell it as historical truth. Jude Law is excelling as a great villain, the rest of the cast are very professional. And since it's mostly an action and CGI movie, professional is good enough. Guy Ritchie, is making his presence felt with dramatic use of camera angles and jumpy editing, at certain scenes. It suits the action scenes all right, it's borderline confusing at other scenes. But I felt it remained within sensible borders.Bottom line is, it's not bad, it's entertaining, and as my title says: it feels like they started with the very beginning of the myth, so they could add a sequel or two, if the box office results are good.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
107,kaptenvideo-89875,"Looks good, entertaining in short dosages, but gets tiresome during the last hour",5,11 May 2017,"Guy Ritchie oh man. He used to be my hero. I loved his two first works – crime comedies Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998) and Snatch."" (2000) which I still name as my favorite movie of all time. Number of (indie) filmmakers have tried to capture his approach ever since – colorful, funny and full of energy, partially thanks to inventive use of modern dance music and snappy editing – but no one has come quite close. Neither has Ritchie himself, actually. He lost his spark when his right hand man left to become a famous Hollywood director of his own. There's an old rumor that producer Matthew Vaughn was actually the man behind most of the good stuff in Ritchie's early movies, and following their later careers, it's actually easy to believe that. Anyway, since 2009 Ritchie has had luck to reinvent himself as the man who makes big-budget modern versions of loved old heroes, so we've had two Sherlock Holmes'es"" with Robert Downey Jr., a spy story The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" and now, King Arthur"". Ritchie has pitched King Arthur"" as Snatch."" meets Tolkien but in reality we get something looking like Game of Thrones"", only without interesting characters, story or even dialogue. The pathetic excuse for a story used here is mostly for stitching the action scenes together and for the last maybe 45 minutes, they just give up, going for the overdose of generic fantasy clichés instead. The result feels surprisingly similar to many recent superhero movies: looks good, is entertaining in short dosages, and gets progressively more tiresome during the last hour – except for the fanboys, maybe. ""King Arthur"" is actually the first of planned six movies. Here's hope that critics are proved right and this will tank at the box office, so we can get something new instead. IMDb hints that Ritchie is thinking about live-action ""Aladdin"" and ""Holmes 3"" next. So... ""King Arthur"" looks good visually and I wanted to like it. Sadly, there is just not enough movie here for 126 minutes. At least the actors did what they could with the shallow material and Charlie Hunnam as the future king is suitably rugged and furious – think Chris Hemsworth in the first Thor"". But this is not enough for serious contender.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

109,austin0731,A great take on the classic tale despite negative reviews,6,14 May 2017,"Despite opening to bad reviews and being dubbed ""The Summer's first box office bomb"" I really enjoyed this rendition of King Arthur. While many reviewers claim that the fantasy genre does not mesh well with Guy Ritchie's high action, high intensity, cut scene style of filming I found it to be very well used and a real breath of fresh air. I enjoyed the comedic quirks that the film managed to incorporate from time to time and felt that Charlie Hunnam does a great job as this 'action hero', charismatic and cocky sort of character. Of course Jude Law as the villain Vortigern also was a wonderful performance. I can see that this film does slip a little as there are often random cut scenes and fast forwards that seemed to be a result of a 3 hour film being axed to around 2 hours, but personally I find this a dismissable issue. I thought that the supporting cast was interesting and served as useful additions to the overall story. Other than this the visuals were well done too, the opening scene gave us a LoTR esque war scene that I really liked. Overall I really liked the whole idea of the overused King Arthur/Excalibur tale being reimagined as this super hyped action hero.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
110,asifahsankhan,"It's actually a ""Superhero Movie"" set in PRE-Christian England, Directed by the Locked, Stocked and Too cheerful den of medieval DODGINESS: Guy Ritchie!",8,2 June 2017,"I'm actually trying my best to find the flaws and criticise it. So bear with me, will you? (some pun intended, of course).""Londinium. Unspecified past circumstances year. A youthful vagrant is found in the Thames, and taken in by the staff of a close-by brothel. It without a doubt isn't a spoiler to state that he grows up to be Charlie Hunnam's Arthur, who pulls a sword from a stone that nobody else can, and angers the lord of England (Jude Law) in doing as such."" Much has been made of that reality that Guy Ritchie has coordinated and co-composed this new reboot of the King Arthur legend, with the expression ""Medieval wide kid"" being begat to portray Hunnam's thought on the focal character. However those early portrayals were a tad brutal. This isn't an Arthur that swaggers his way around Camelot, wheeler managing like Del Boy. Or maybe, he's a conventional bloke that doesn't especially need the consideration that expelling a weapon from a stone appears to accumulate.The age-old Arthurian legend rose to countless poems, stories, novels, plays and movies — not to mention operas, paintings and at least one obscure rock album. But the new Guy Ritchie film was, not one that was inspired by it.In the first place, ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" makes a radical departure from this well-known body of tales, bearing almost no similarity to any of it. Worse yet, it's among the most tedious, insipid, brain-deadening movies I have ever seen. More than once I had to exert herculean will-power not to simply get up and walk out.This is surprising in an era when it's customary to cleverly reboot some age-old chestnut — as director Ritchie himself did with Robert Downey in the two recent Sherlock Holmes movies.But this script utterly fails him on one articulacy here: retaining only the famous sword-in-the-stone incident.This would not necessarily be a problem except that A) the sword- pulling episode generates absolutely zero interest; and B) the evil Vortigern, plus Arthur's quest for vengeance on him, is really all this film can give us in place of Merlin, Gawain, the Holy Grail, Guenevere and Lancelot, Tristan and Isolde.The two actors who fully registers are Hunnam - who impresses with his charm, and action capabilities, but could've done with more time to loiter in the emotional scenes - and Law, who is utterly despicable as King Vortigern. If you thought Law was at his nastiest in The Young Pope, think again. He has some of the most memorable scenes here, for some not-very-nice reasons.For every exciting moment here, there's an infuriating one to counteract it. Hunnam and Law impress, and there are enough fun moments and strong action scenes to make a sequel sound appealing. But there's also a disjointed script that favours banter-stuffed cutaway montages over character development and the magical elements that make this lore interesting.The Arthurian legend is so old that it's long since passed into the realm of myth, with historians and scholars fighting endlessly over which pieces of the story are real and which are fabrication. What King Arthur: Legend of the Sword presupposes is this: Does any of that even matter?The film's answer: Not really! History is beside the point. Arguing about ""accuracy"" in a movie like this is a fool's game, and knowing this, Legend of the Sword finds its own modern story in the midst of the legend.I believe, since it's an era of superheroes: This is actually a Superhero Movie as well. Set in PRE-Christian England and Directed by the Locked, Stocked and Too cheerful den of medieval Dodginess: Guy Ritchie! And, since not every movie is a political statement in 2017, but some of them sure are, it's altogether fitting that King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a goofy, splendid medieval romp that also makes a distinctly English case for a moderate populism. It's kind of generic, sure, and Camelot's greatest fans may consider the film blasphemy. But as a piece of silly summer entertainment, it's very good.Occasionally, it's even pretty Great. Overall, fantastic, if not yet, Legendary.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
111,FelipeCarrillo,"It's not legendary, is it madcap? Yes, of course",6,11 August 2017,"Curious question: Is it possible to determine the full amount in which the legend of Arthur of Brittany has been portrayed (independent in expression) in any audiovisual media? The answer would be an authentic indeterminacy. Edwin S. Porter's ""Parfisal"" had no idea of the narrative phenomenon that was going to cause time after its release in 1904. Epic-medieval-knightly adventures have known how to ration their elixir of immortality, since a decade and half a century later, the London tales located in the full expanse from the 10th century to the 15th century, erroneously, they simulate possessing the essential vigor for creating a saga ala ""Avengers in the medieval London"", owned by Warner Bros., in the middle of the Millennium era, of course, hitting the nail on the head with the chosen filmmaker for modernizing the Celtic story. He sins due to his creativity by basing on the sharp literary sword with too much freedom, falling into his deep-rooted directional record, arousing a swirl of varied mixes that offer a new King Arthur face.A young cherubic Arthur, a famous character in the European literature, is forced to witness the extermination of not only his realm but his own nuclear family, adding with irony, a stab in the back by his uncle Vortigern (Jude Law). Brought up among bosoms of lust, dearth and Love, Charlie Hunnam grows between rustic London alleys with knocks and shocks, for according to the leonine legend and the extravagant narrative thread written by ten hands, redefine his philosophy of life and accept what destiny holds: to become the ideal monarch in both war and peace. And yeah! despite big freedom, Excalibur is to be present, what would King Arthur do without what makes him King Arthur?Being a cornerstone of the medieval literature expansion, the story has been one of the most influential and prominent in the film world, interpretations that fall into the hands and minds of dissimilar filmmakers who have infused it, for better or worse, their distinctive signature using the annals of the character, which is rumored, it's fictitious. Guy Ritchie, a British director of features as ingrained as iterative who was trend years ago with his second motion picture ""Snatch"", getting to win over Warner Bros. Company in order to hold him responsible for a big-size revamp with a budget of USD 175 million. That Ritchie who made it on her own to the early twentieth century with his fast-paced, and comic—even hyper—style, which required the spectator enough attention not to be lost in the whirlwind of stop-and-go stories both via flashbacks and flash-forwards, suffocates the opportunity with an unusual medley of genres and ideas, though their risky elections are welcomed, don't end up to set completely, such as the ""Ritchinian"" opening attributed to the childhood of the main role where it isn't perceived fluency, doesn't generate interest and visibly shows an embarrassing appearance, revealing the fatigue of the director to keep his touch with every work, something that doesn't impact the same way anymore. In addition to the above, new innovations ranging from top angles increasing and focusing the visual field as if it was a video game, the inclusion of views in the first person or even the application of a street and urban accent to an epic chase through London passages, a cinema breaking traditionalism but never becomes truly suggestive.Visually speaking, ""King Arthur"" raises interesting re-inventions, in which are the required elements so that it doesn't feel foreign to the base story altogether. It's clear that visual effects make us dizzy and, in certain periods, spoil the image in its entirety, however, only a few are the found true flaws in the shots of colossal elephants ruining empires, a kingdom as vast as dreary, enchanted waters by a god and his penitents, among others. In a nutshell, the film receives a dark and pessimistic tone, a technique that would have worked in the first half of the feature film, where the protagonist is immersed in confusion and searching for himself.With the help of some marketing posters and certain advertising videos, can be detected who deals with the weight of the story: Charlie Hunnam and Jude Law. The first one looks pretty good with sloppy clothes and blonde hair of Arturo, his acting is credible and the style he endows the character is enjoyable, even despite the stereotyped outline of his role. As for Law, his performances are always excellent, and although this one is not enough, perhaps because of the lack of understanding about the magnitude of the role, he executes suitably perverse insanity, treachery, and greed of a king chosen by mistake.Projecting the viewer a film hybrid that only finds its point of glory in selected visuals that can be categorized as visionaries and sequences of struggle and annihilation executed with flair, of course, embellishing them with a delightful soundtrack at the hands of Daniel Pemberton; Charlie Hunnam and Guy Ritchie achieve being a different summer movie, on their own merit, alas, leaving on the way, more and more quickly, the considerable expectations they had.

121,Semisonic,Today's illusion of past grandeur,6,31 July 2017,"The goal of art in general, and of cinema in particular, is to stir emotions in us. And if we take this as the sole criterion of our satisfaction, then King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is definitely a film worth watching, with some powerful moments you'd feel partial to. But if you're one of the ""we need to go deeper"" kind, someone who values not emotions per se but the way they've been nourished, then it's a trickier story.First of all, I had no idea that it was a Guy Ritchie film until I saw his name in the opening credits. A few years ago that would've been a reassuring sign. But after The Man from UNCLE I grew somewhat suspicious of Ritchie's ability to produce anything truly impressive outside his home turf niche of London crime life. Whether he'd be able to pull off his old-time magic was both a question and a reason to keep watching and find out.And no, I don't think he did it. King Arthur tries to be a typical Ritchie film much, MUCH harder than TMFU, with fast-paced caustic banter, lowlife scheming and certain camera tricks straight from RocknRolla. But there's still something crucial missing, and I think it's the texture of the setting. You just can't come to England of middle-age fables and make it look like you're about to start selling fake jewellery in a poor borough or setting up an underground boxing match. There's no believable background, and there are definitely no suitable men for the job. Even Charlie Hunnam, despite all his muscles and formal englishness, sounds more like an American to me. I'm Russian myself, so what do I know, but still he's no Gerard Butler and definitely no Jason Statham when it comes to talking like a true Brit with the taste for crime.Still, this film does have life in it. Artificially created by the so-called ""epic"" scenes and dramatic score, and carefully produced by the dialogues full of pathos and exchanges of all-meaning glances. But, unlike TMFU that tried to look classy but ended up limp and weak, this one has something borderline visceral about it, something that manages to touch you even though you clearly realize it's purely fake and commercial. Maybe for all this we should be grateful to Astrid Bergès-Frisbey, probably the most exotic and stunning beauty I've seen in Western cinema in years - even though she's as far from being British as this film is far from a historical documentary -, to Aidan Gillen, who's now forever doomed to be Littlefinger but manages to use it to our mutual benefit by bringing over the image of a true cunning bastard, and to Jude Law, who doesn't only make sense of the devil but also produces the most authentic drama this film has to offer.Overall, the film is quite bearable, if not pleasant, except for its jerky, chaotic and disturbingly surreal opening. But even that overall pleasantness is still a step down for the author. Once a visionary, able to turn into gold everything he touches, Ritchie is clearly out of depth these days, and even borrowing visual tricks from another once-a-visionary Zach Snyder hardly helps creating a sense of cinematographic magic, cocky and daring, which all his gangster films emanate. He's still far from the likes of M. Night Shyamalan, but if the trend is not reversed, we all will be sad to remember King Arthur among those films that took the path of the genius downhill towards the realm of generic and purely commercial.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

This film is like an elderly prostitute, looks good from a distance but once you get close, makeup and CGI can only hide so much. All look and action but totally forgetting to have a decent story. The cinematic style is so similar to that used for Ritchies Sherlock Holmes films, that it is further distracting from an already weak story, a few 'alright mates' thrown in, doesn't make it any more entertaining.

The town prostitutes pick young Arthur from the boat (yes, like Moses) and he lives with them. Later - not a king yet - Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) takes the Sword Excalibur out of the stone and Vortigern now knows he is the son of King Uther and wants him killed. Arthur escapes and is cared for by The Mage (Astrid Berges- Frisbey) who is a student of Merlin who we never see. Arthur finally comes to know who he is and is on a mission to defeat Vortigern.The beginning of this is somewhat confusing and you needed the above to let you enjoy the movie. The very dark scenes and over- sized elephants lead you believe you have no idea what is going on. Hope you like a lot of CGI, and fighting, fighting, fighting. It just never ends. But the CGI is spectacular. This is not the version of King Arthur that I am somewhat familiar with. Here we see some supernatural magic thanks to The Mage, who is quite pretty too. The acting, dialogues, cinematography and acting were all good. Just too many dark scenes and too much fighting mob style – in other words everyone in the movie is fighting, but no gore and that was a good thing. Some humor was attempted, but they needed to try harder. Notables: Arthur's men: Djimon Houndou as Bedivere, Aidan Gillen as Bill, Freddie fox as Rubio, Craig McGinlay as Percival. Geoff Bell as Michief John, and Tom Wu as George.Then there is Annabelle Wallis as Maggie, a counselor to Vortigern, but really working for Arthur, but we really don' see too much of that. Oh, and David Beckham (yes, that David Beckham) as Trigger. He's the one with the very large bow that shoots very large arrows.I was disappointed in the way Arthur takes Excalibur out of the stone. Again, not like other King Arthur versions. At the end, we see Arthur's men being knighted, and there is some confusion regarding the large item in front of them and they kept guessing what it is. As the scene fades away we hear someone say, ""it's a table."" Actually, this was the best of the humor. See? We come to know it as The Round Table.

This was (is) intended to be the first part of the 6 part franchise. I was shocked to see the rotten tomatoes rating of this film. So low!!!! I thought that how a Guy Ritchie film can go this low!! But I have finally saw the film and I can with a great sense of relief say that this film is good.Plot: Arthur raised in Londinium realizes his heritage and decides to fight back.Story and direction: I remember studying King Arthur in school. I enjoyed the takes as I heard them. So I was finally excited when a film-maker like Guy Ritchie is directing this classic. In history, every film except the 1981 film Excalibur was panned by the critics. But I was confident for this film. My expression after this film was ""Go to hell. Critics."" The film is good. I could connect with every character in the film. The film also follows the normal Guy Ritchie route where comedy is inserted in parts. I like that in his films. Also some scenes are told in flash-forward type (which was a very fresh take). The sets and VFX too are spectacular. Now with the faults. Now in a King Arthur film I expect to see Merlin. Merlin was there for only one scene in the film and we don't see his face. I mean, come on!!! I was very disappointed in that thing. Another thing was the action and the film's heavy reliance on CGI. That made me disappointed. Even in the climax we see Arthur fighting his uncle in the form of a demon. I was shouting out for some real fighting.Acting: Charlie Hunnam was great as Arthur. His body and his acting all were shouting as to why he was the right choice. Astrid Bergès-Frisbey was OK as the Mage. Djimon Hounsou was great as Bedivere. Aidan Gillain was also good as Bill. Jude Law was the ultimate evil as Vortigen.Favorite Scene: The scene where Arthur reaches the top of the Darklands and we see as to actually what happened the night Arthur's parents were killed. The pain on Arthur's face is clearly visible in this scene.Verdict: I had a great time watching this film. Yes, the film has faults but it is an enjoyable watch. I can safely say that this is not Guy Ritchie's worst. I hope they make more Arthur films (and they are successful too!!!) I am going with an 8/10.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
126,phoenixinvictus,Is this movie really about King Arthur and what is with the nosebleeds?,3,28 June 2017,"I watched the first five minutes of this picture and knew that it was going to bomb. The impression that I got was the writers couldn't make up their minds about what to do so they pretty much tossed in everything in the pot and expected that the special effects and good actors would pay off for the mediocre script.There were times when I thought I was watching Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Vikings, The Last Kingdom, a British gangster movie and a Kung Fu flick all in one. The idea to turn King Arthur into a pimp\gangster is insane if not laughable. I almost expected a UFO to come in whizzing to rescue Arthur.The first act passes so quickly that we don't understand what motivates the characters. The characters are too one or two dimensional and I really can't feel any sympathy for King Arthur or anyone else for that matter. Some of the scenes just didn't make any sense. Some characters are simply killed off with no other reason than a cheap attempt to rouse the viewer into indignation.In the beginning Eric Bana hands Jude Law a crown and we're left wondering why he has a nosebleed...

But any claims to be an Arthurian movie are lost in that description, which is also accurate as they only provide a fairly thin covering for this fantasy film. The Arthurian elements are limited, and so minimal to the overall story line, they are effectively irrelevant - really only adding the names. Without them this is a fairly ok fantasy romp, with good effects, and some fancy editing, and some very obvious rip offs of LOTR (eg Camelots tower is very similar to the tower in Mordor, and Vortigerns magic aspect is basically the Balrog- there are others). The fancy editing makes things more interesting in terms of parallel scenes playing at the same time, but that doesn't really mask the limited depth of this other than to be an entertaining romp. Arthurian purists will (rightly) deride it as adding nothing to the genre, but if you can get past that, its not a bad popcorn movie.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
130,bushtony,A fantasy vision of a fantasy based on mythology,6,4 August 2017,"What do we have here in this critically mauled cinematic artefact? The knee jerk is to hate and condemn right off the bat. Rather than do that, a more measured and considered view might be in order. Let's not be quite so hasty.The Arthurian legend source material is itself a combination of fantasy and mythology which conflicts and contradicts itself. Did Arthur actually exist? We don't know for sure. Was he a product of England, the county of Cornwall, Wales or Ireland – different accounts put him in different places at different times? The standard blueprint is and remains several pieces of literature by various authors and poets – Walter Scott, Thomas Malory, Tennyson, Coleridge. And, of course, cinematic representations and retellings. As to the truth of the matter – it's pretty much what you make it. Any version of the story is going to be a fantasy vision of a fantasy based on mythology – mythology being mostly fantasy in itself.Guy Ritchie chooses filter his fantasy version of a fantasy based on mythology through the murky prism of his Eastend mockney gangster stylings. Which are derived from concepts based on fact, modern urban legend and myth. You can see how he started to make the loose connections between these two fantastical worlds. And in a certain context it works.If anyone expects the dreamy mystical philosophical vibe of Boorman's ""Excalibur"" that's not on offer. Those complaining about the lack of historical accuracy and realistic time-framing in terms of language and visuals should be aware that in reality there isn't any in any version or account. ""Excalibur"" and all retellings share the same level of ""realism"" as Disney's ""Sword in The Stone.""What Ritchie gives us is a loud, brash, fast-moving, aggressive and massively pompous slab of popcorn cinema that will work for some and not for others. Personally, I found it to be entertaining enough for the duration and at least it's a stab at doing something a bit different with the old chestnut. It's visually impressive in places, with certain degree of sweep and scope here and there. It's a reasonable time-waster and at least it's relatively unpretentious. And to my mind undeserving of the mass kicking it's been given by elitist critics, punters and the historically delusional.For now, it's a critical punching bag and box-office bomb. Give it ten years, it will probably re-emerge and be regarded as a ""cult"" item in genre cinema. Life is fickle like that.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The source material is fatigued, the film was unnecessary, the mish- mash of genres kind of approach is a yawn, but Ritchie's signature and top billing should thrust haters away. No miracles were expected, no surprises were projected so why go see it? Maybe for all of the above.Love him or hate him, Ritchie is an auteur in his own right, shepherding a whole sub-genre in his trail that never disappoints those who want to follow. The Legend of the Sword stampedes in with creative liberties, raping the IP left and right with anachronisms, implausibilities and gaping plot holes but it does so with shameless bravery, blatant recycled humour and undeniable charisma. Maybe Arthur was not the trailblazer in changing Hollywood's current formula or obsession with superhero crossover exhaustion. Maybe it is just this year's bombastic financial dud that makes its niche and tongue-in-cheek enjoyment all the more justified.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

135,joshbarton15,Not awful but it's not very good either,4,21 May 2017,"A fantasy epic is not the sort of film you'd associate with Guy Ritchie, a British director who made a name for himself with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, two high quality British gangster films. Alas, here we are and Ritchie has directed King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, a film that takes the loosely based on Arthurian legends very literally indeed.Robbed of his birthright, Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) is raised the hard way in the back alleys of the city. However, once he pulls Excalibur from the stone, he learns of his true heritage and the legacy he must acknowledge, whether he likes it or not.Ritchie's film moves along with a confident swagger, mainly down to the way he decides to tell the story however, it's not enough to stop King Arthur from becoming a bit of a mess overall. I found it entertaining enough but the film just doesn't feel as if it has any meaning, particularly when you consider the potential that Arthurian legend has to become the next big fantasy franchise.As much as I enjoyed some of the banter that the film offers, I can't help but feel as if Ritchie was just playing it for laughs instead of trying to tell a worthwhile story. Tone down the banter and try to forge a narrative to connect with the audience would be my advice.I wasn't a big fan of how rushed all of the action sequences were either, choppy editing and some video game level visuals towards the end of the film really making me question the budget of this film. There's a training montage halfway through where Arthur must take on a number of creatures which would have been pretty good had it not have been edited so badly. It's near impossible to tell what the hell is going on.Coming to the performances, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword has some serviceable performances at its disposal, mainly from Jude Law as the villainous Vortigern and Djimon Hounsou as Sir Bedivere. Charlie Hunnam, who I've always been wary of, does a decent job as Arthur, actually suiting Ritchie's dynamic rather well. There is a cameo from David Beckham that doesn't ruin the film at all but it certainly goes down as one of the worst cameos I think I've ever seen. Why let him play a supposedly intimidating character when he possesses such a high- pitched voice?!It's no secret that King Arthur: Legend of the Sword has bombed at the box-office, looking set to lose Warner Bros. around $100 million. Guy Ritchie has to take a large slice of the blame as he continues to stray away from the quality of his first two gangster films but maybe it's partly down to the fact that fantasy epics just find it much harder to find an audience.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
136,jaredpahl,Guy Ritchie's Bizarre King Arthur is an Ungainly Disaster,2,9 September 2020,"I don't see enough bad movies. I'm not a paid film critic. I'm not forced to see everything that comes out, so I generally seek out things I think I might enjoy. With this strategy, I see plenty of mediocre films, some disappointing movies, but very few outright terrible cinematic garbage fires. In a sense, I'm grateful for a film like King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. This is pretty much the bottom of the barrel for a big-budget blockbuster helmed by a well-known director. Genuine Hollywood productions don't come much more incomprehensibly imagined, designed, and assembled.Guy Ritchie's take on the legend of King Arthur is directionless. The bonkers opening scene goes the route of complete high fantasy. 500 foot tall war elephants, equally gigantic crumbling CGI castles, flaming demon monsters, and the like. It's the best part of the film, delivering baseline Medieval action and CG destruction. After that first 5 minute sequence, however, Ritchie loses the thread. The rest of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a hideous mishmash of whatever type of filmmaking Ritchie feels like doing in the moment. Mostly though, he grafts on his signature hyperactive editing junk onto a standard fantasy adventure story that benefits nothing from having a dozen inserts flash across the screen in two seconds. I stress, this movie looks, moves, and sounds revolting. Legend of the Sword insults the very word 'cinematography'. Not only is 80% of the film grey digital sludge, but the other 20% is computer generated particle effects. Has anyone ever been impressed by digital fire or lightning or smoke effects? This is an After Effects demo reel, not a movie. Or perhaps more apt, a video game. A crappy, third-party Lord of the Rings ripoff developed by a British frat house.In a cast that includes talented actors like Eric Bana, Jude Law, and Djimon Hounsou, nobody acts well. Bana gets lost in the mix, Law doesn't know how to play his character, and Hounsou phones in a boring supporting performance. Charlie Hunnam is King Arthur, and as long as I'm taking the piss out of the director, I might as well do the same for this film's ""star"". Charlie Hunnam is a black hole of charisma. He is a faceless personality void. A male, British placeholder. Just good-looking enough, just as flatly accented as he needs to be to completely disappear from your consciousness.No decision in Legend of the Sword comes with a purpose. Maybe you can call Guy Ritchie an auteur. He does things that are unique to him. But have those stylistic flourishes ever really worked? I mean in anything. I'm starting to doubt it. I guess it's neither here nor there in this case. In King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, nothing Ritchie does works. He plays around with strange slow motion, misplaced humor, and those terrible visual effects, with reckless aimlessness. There is no effort made to tie together the Snatch-Lite bro talk sequences with the squid creatures, soccer player cameos, and boss battle cutscenes. What a lumbering catastrophe this King Arthur movie is.20/100",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
137,barbagvido,"Epic fantasy, Guy Ritchie style",9,31 May 2017,"King Arthur:Legend of the Sword is a new take on the famous legend, this time taken on by Guy Ritchie, who I sometimes call ""British Tarantino"". There were a lot of reasons to be concerned about this movie: movie being pushed back for almost an entire year, Ritchie's direction leading to tonal issues... All in all, it could have ended up being a mess pretty easily. Surprisingly, this is a very stylish and entertaining movie.That doesn't mean the movie is without its problems. There are obvious cuts and gaps in the story and the movie actually does feel a little choppy, but only at times. Also, it could have been a little more memorable. It's not memorable in a way that you remember all scenes and plot points, but it leaves another kind of impression with its genius style. This is one of the most stylish fantasy movies I've ever seen. Epic fantasy setting and Guy Ritchie's dialogues fit surprisingly well together and the music helps boost the epic feel (so far, definitely one of the best scores of the year if not the best). The action scenes are directed a bit hyper-actively, but not in a way that everything goes way too fast and you can't catch what's going on. This is one of those rare cases when it boosts up the adrenaline and I feel Ritchie did a great job there. The actors are okay, no one really sticks out, but Charlie Hunamm steals the screen with his presence and charisma alone. But you can definitely see the rest of the actors being comfortable in their roles too.The movie may feel a bit choppy at times, but what saves it for me is the style that Guy Ritchie once again successfully brought to the table with intensely directed action scenes and clever dialogues.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
138,paulijcalderon,"A rocky road, but when it wants to have fun it's entertaining.",6,10 May 2017,"I feel like this movie will get a lot of mixed (to negative) reactions. For me it's very mixed. If you enjoy Guy Ritchie's storytelling style, then you'll probably have fun. If you don't, then you'll have a tough time trying to keep track on what's going on. This film moves really, really fast. It hardly ever calms down to have quiet moments. It's constantly moving from place to place with new information fed to you, and sometimes also skipping further in time and then backwards in time.. It's basically all over the place. The story and characters are perfectly fine, it's just that the way it's made and told is not always working to move it along. It's a rocky road, but when it wants to have fun it's entertaining.At times I would have preferred a more traditional style. So, that's the biggest risk the filmmakers took. It's good whenever it works and sometimes it's really fun. It takes a few scenes until you get the hang of it. I didn't expect so much magic though. But, I will say that the magic elements were pretty nice. The opening battle sequence was over the top and fantastical in just the right way. Some of the grounded fight scenes weren't as good because they used too much shaky cam. Which bothers me because you have really nice looking sets, costumes and a good build-up for the action to get started. But, when that happens it's not as great as the build-up would make you believe. It's fine, you can enjoy it. But, it was messy at places. There's this one scene where Arthur is a 100% CGI when fighting bad guys and it was very noticeable. You could tell the audience was put off by that scene.OK, so what did I like? Well, the soundtrack was neat and it worked well throughout. The mythological aspects are interesting and I wish that would have been explored more. What we get is classic medieval fantasy. But, hey! I liked it in this movie. It's classic and it helps with the world building. The overall visual style is great. The one shame is that many of the best shots last for a few seconds. So, you don't get the time to fully appreciate them. Everyone in Sweden will recognize Mikael Persbrandt playing a viking. Which is a fitting character for him to play. It was fun seeing him be part of it. The whole cast is nice. Jude Law is having a good time playing a bad guy. Astrid Berges-Frisbey plays the wizard who is able to control animals. She does a nice job and I bought the fact she knew magic. You can notice that everyone working on the film were enjoying it. There are jokes and comedic moments, and you know what? It made me chuckle here and there. I like the scenes when Arthur and his gang are plotting their heists or plans. The Guy Ritchie style shines when it's used right, and those are the scenes where it works in this movie.It's one of those movies where you have to pay attention. So, no casual watching because you will miss some important info. It's way too fast at times and the shaky cam got annoying. The medieval fantasy stuff is nice and the visuals with the fast pace will have you entertained. I liked the humor and the characters. I've enjoyed Guy Ritchie's movies (at least the ones I've seen). This is not his best work, but it's a good effort. I'm gonna be nice to this movie because I had a fun time watching it. Only some parts put me off guard. If it had been more toned down and not rushed through some of Arthur's adventures, it would have been great. It's not completely there yet, but it's a good time. Go in for the magic realms and classic Shakespearean characters. Because all of that's pretty entertaining and fun.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
139,jburtonprod-802-759029,Why Was this Movie Made?,5,11 August 2017,"I really don't get movies like this. The filmmakers obviously have no respect or love for Arthurian legends. What they did here was just pick names out of a hat and said 'Oh, these are Arthurian names! Let's make a new story using them!!!"". They do manage to have the sword in the Stone but then they'd have to since it's in the title. Everything else is spun out of whole cloth with no regard for what actually made the story of Arthur LEGEND.Okay, let's just go through it one by one. Mordred was NEVER a wizard who lived before Arthur was born. He was Arthur's SON from Morgan le Fay and he was never a wizard, just a dickhead with a Daddy Complex. Vortigern was NEVER Uther's evil brother, who practiced Black Magic. He was one of the kings of the old Un-United Kingdom that Arthur eventually united. Uther never turned into a rock. There was never a Dark Tower. I wonder where they got that from? There was never an underwater octopus creature that sprouted 3 women that I'm guessing was someone's Wikipedia understanding of the Hecate. There was never a giant snake that pulled a Sidewinder Ex Machina instead of figuring out a way to WRITE your way out of the final conflict. To give you an idea of the total lack of scholarship involved, Arthur's wizard, who they make woman for no reason other than to be 'hip and fresh' is called, The Mage. Couldn't they at least have made her Morgan le Fay since it's just a name soup? I mean, she was actually an enchantress. Come to think of it, that might have worked. They have MlF help Arthur early on only to be supplanted by Merlin. She gets angry and decides to trick Arthur into having her child. But then it'd be too close to the subject matter they've never read. The production ideas are half-baked retreads of ""300"" for the fighting scenes mixed in with the Ring Wraith view world of the Trilogy of the Ring. The only time the movie really hums is the montage of Arthur rising up as a street hood, which plays into Guy Ritchie's wheelhouse. And it's also close enough to the source material that it's the only part that seems authentic. Other than that it seems like a movie that was made from watching other movies. HOW ABOUT READING A BOOK and trying to translate that to the screen??? You know, like some great filmmakers have done for decades??? At least you should know your subject matter inside and out so when you're making a change it makes sense and other's who are watching the movie because they actually LOVE the Arthurian Legends can enjoy it.On a related matter, I think I could buy Charlie Hunnam as the new James Bond. He's a convincing action hero with an attitude. He'd need a bit of a tan with darker hair, though.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

In terms of positives, I thought Charlie Hunnam and Jude Law were really good in their roles. There was also really strong costume and production design. However, what brought this movie down was it's overall story. Look, I think there are great individual scenes.

141,just_in_case,A lot of amazing moments in a horribly messy film.,7,19 December 2019,"Ive been avoiding this since release because the reviews often described it as a mess almost painful to watch. I finally sat down for it and can confirm the former is true if not the latter. There's a pretty great movie in there somewhere and this is one of the times I don't enjoy talking bad about a movie. There's actually a single scene that encompasses the overall weakness of this film. At a certain point our hero is forced to go on a journey to find his connection to the realm. He goes through an amazing trial, fighting awesome monsters and desperately trying to survive in a subplot worthy of LOTR. Because its Guy Ritchie its told through a 100 fast cuts where you just get glimpses of what he's going through while constantly cutting back to two characters arguing comically about why he should or shouldn't have gone. Its so frustrating because you just want to scream STOOOOP at the screen because you actually want to see whats going on. The movie is inconsistently peppered with frustrating scenes like this and while that stuff works in campy British crime comedies, it just wasn't right for this film. Everything else was pretty great, story, characters, acting, etc. Given what the design teams were going for(The super natural stuff is awesome), I cant help but feel like Guilermo Del Toro or Peter Jackson would have been much better suited to help this. Its a real shame. I think I still enjoyed myself, but Id never watch this again. I'm a big Guy Ritchie fan, but he was so wrong for this.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Well, the question is naive because the answer is easy: certainly it has to do with lots of people willing to spend money to watch it.Let's state it clear then: either your sole other choices are burning your money and watching anything even worse (yeah... unfortunately there's worse: imagery is stunning and direction isn't as dull as it could have been, given the script) XOR you should consider giving up watching King Arthur.Sooner or later people will stop paying to watch jokes like this one, and we'll all enjoy better entertainment for a wiser audience.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

For example, on Rotten Tomatoes, the critic score is about 30 percent positive while the audience score is about 70 percent positive. The special effects are enormously enjoyable, but the scraped together MTV collage effect is both confusing and redundant. Maddening even. It is a film best viewed highly intoxicated and with a solid distraction (I am writing this review as the third act of the movie ""unfolds""). A few bongs tokes in wouldn't hurt either. I'm not a hater, and I know a valiant attempt when I see it, and so I'm giving this one a five due to the acting and special effects, even though I know anyone who knows how to critically evaluate movies would eviscerate me for this betrayal.

Daniel Pemberton has done something incredible giving you mysterious and at the same time blood pumping soundtrack. The hallmark style of the director is moving the story with an unstoppable force smashing the barricades of boredom. The variety of characters is stunning and you instantly get to know who is good or bad, which is straightforwardly simple and slightly disappointing. The plot gives a new kick to my vision of Arthur's adventure having its ups and downs that make the overall curve almost flat but still way above than just interesting.Jumping back to characters, the word needs to be said about Charlie Hunnam - amazing leader and real king, and Jude Low that got caught into the trap of stereotypes but did his best to hide it.

149,jeannefrancoise,King Arthur movie in millennial time,8,16 May 2017,"Dear readers, yesterday I have watched King Arthur movie, directed by Guy Ritchie. This is not the first movie about King Arthur that I had ever watched, so here I want to share to you my perspective of this movie. Firstly is of course about the title. The title is ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"", so that these movie is all about the relation between Arthur as a king and his magic sword, there is no other legend surrounded besides King Arthur, for example King Arthur and round table, King Arthur and Dragon, or King Arthur and Holy Grail. The movie is really focused on the story of the sword from the beginning of the scene, but we can see the process of life or Arthur of being ""a king"". This is interesting. Secondly I want to review about the role of King Arthur himself as the role-center in this movie. Not likely other heroes movies, that destructed by Love and family, in this movie, King Arthur is mostly like ""lone traveler"" and ""one man show"" hero. You can see the whole plots that it is King Arthur who decides everything, nevertheless he has several best friends, armies, and a witch beside him to help him, but King Arthur is shown not as a play mate, not as a handsome lover, not as a generous king, but as an ordinary man to gain power. Third issue is about the plot or the story that leads this movie. Connected with the role of King Arthur, this movie does not include the hero-side of King Arthur while he is becoming a great king, in contrary, this movie shows the ordinary Arthur living in slum areas before he is becoming a king, and magically this ordinary-Arthur being forced to have an extraordinary adventure to receive his destiny to become a King. Maybe for realist movie-maker critics, this is the weakest point of this movie, because the plot is can be easily done by intervention of other events of the plots and also there is no director's own point of view for the figure of King Arthur. It seems that Guy Ritchie just making the legend of King Arthur, as everybody wish on how they see King Arthur legend, not based on director's imagination or creativity. But lastly, like other Guy Ritchie's movies, the backward-forward scenes, high musics, and proper actors/actress could entertain all millennial generations to see the handsome and muscles King Arthur and his legend of sword.

152,shweta-51657,Another score for Guy Ritchie,8,14 September 2017,"Don't know why everyone is whinging about this movie. I loved it! I went in with zero expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Main highlight: the use of music and sound. That alone earns this movie 5 on 5. But then again, Ritchie always knew what he was doing in the sound department (Rocknrolla ring a bell anyone?). All the scenes are artfully done and wonderful pacing of music only makes it better, if not steals the damn show. Another plus point would be the quickly paced scenes of dialogues over pivotal plot bits that we've all come to anticipate and love from Guy Ritchie. Action sequences were well done too. Ignore the bad reviews. Trust me. Watch.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
153,randymcbeast,A classic completely ruined by Guy Ritchie,1,2 June 2018,"Guy Ritchie was quick to take credit in the opening scenes so it's only fair to call him out on producing such a pile of garbage. I mean, c'mon, it's an amazing story, he had a serious budget, and the cast was loaded with top talent. So much to work with only further emphasizes the incompetence of Ritchie.The movie is just awful in so many different aspects. The humor is off. The storytelling is annoyingly choppy. The slow motion is irritation. The soundtrack is off. The quick flashbacks were constantly thrown in and nauseating. The direction took the actors into a place where they could not be taken seriously and you weren't transported back in time to live the classic story. So much more to complain about. Just avoid and you'll be better off.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

155,M_Exchange,Absolutely god awful,2,26 May 2017,"I made it through twenty minutes. It has possibly the worst video editing that I've ever seen in a film in my life. I didn't even know what I was watching sometimes during those twenty minutes. They cut from one meaningless thing to another like it was vital to a story element when, in fact, it was just a supposedly cool ""Suicide Squad"" style sequence. It also had two video montages during those twenty minutes, which was intolerable, partly because they were done in the same frantic and headache-inducing manner that the regular cuts were shot in.There was a battle in which the evil mages that were seizing power were apparently casting spells from the tops of gigantic elephants, but we never saw them actually wielding magic. We just saw people being blown back by explosions. In the meantime, they just showed the mages' glowing eyes. So when Eric Bana's character beheaded the main mage (which ALSO wasn't even shown) it makes it all the more meaningless.At one point, in one of the worst examples of foreshadowing (if it can even be called such) that I've ever seen in a film, someone reminds a group that Jude Law's character studied with the evil mages. His response: ""What are you implying?"" Smash cut to Jude performing an evil ritual whereby he became the new king. Aaaaaaand someone please kill me.When it finally got around to Charlie Humman taking over the main rebel role, I couldn't have cared less. As other people have noted, he is dead-faced and expressionless. I couldn't have cared less if he regained his family's power.I'm going to go with two stars just because the tentacled demon creature with three women that Jude worships was one creepy positive in this dumpster fire.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

And it almost works.For me, the previous movie ""Excalibur"" is one of the best retelling of the King Arthur story.Guy Ritchie hasn't tried to best this, but has instead decided to totally rewrite it! Why would you do this to a classic legend?Suddenly we have giant elephants, Kung Fu in London, exploding arrows (gun powder was still undiscovered) and peasants with cockney accents, to provide just a few examples.Throw in a Star Wars type resistance with a Robin Hood, Maid Marion type spy, a mix of loud old fashioned music with new, a ton of CGI with ridiculous designed castles and towers, and you have King Arthur.At the start the evil King is told all he has to do is kill Arthur, and he will succeed. So why doesn't he? At the start, we have the excuse that once captured, Arthur is kept alive for a public execution.But at the end, the evil King knocks Arthur to the ground, and then turns his back on him and gives Arthur a minute or so to regain his senses, walk up behind him, and kill him!This is a forgettable romp, not a legend.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
157,wrightiswright,My Review,5,6 June 2019,"Guy Ritchie: ""In adapting the Arthurian legend for the 21st century, I decided to make some slight changes. Namely: Introduce a multi-ethnic cast and dialogue completely at odds with the era. Put in slow-motion battle scenes more worthy of a dodgy Matrix sequel. Put in a random events plots where almost anything goes without any rhyme or reason. Put Golden Balls in for a completely unnecessary, distracting bit-part. To further these plans, I have a budget of $175, and I'm not afraid to use it! The audience will love it!

159,thisseatofmars,"Snatch, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Excaliburs",8,18 November 2017,"This is actually a great movie. Really great, in fact. Why critics ""warned audiences to stay away"" is beyond me; I've never thought much of critics, anyway. It's so much easier to tear something apart and make fun instead of creating work of your own. ""Why have enemies when you can have friends?""Guy Ritchie uses his speed up-slow down film editing to good effect and fast-talking (working class?) Brit dialogue to give this fantasy movie a feeling of grit. Really, it's like Snatch or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels mixed with legend: and it works, surprisingly. Sometimes the grit goes overboard into the absurd (King Arthur in this version is raised in a brothel and later works as a pimp, ""lol,"") and everyone speaks in that gravelly sort of tough man's growl, which people never actually speak in. Ever. But so much of this movie just *works.* I loved the climax, Jude Law's demon knight, the music, and how Arthur blesses the villain upon defeating him. ""You make sense of the devil."" That's beautiful. The film's weakness is its lead, Charlie Hunnam. He's a beefy dude, sure: his neck's as big as his head (he's got that chicken cutlet physique, baby) but I'll always like him for being in Pacific Rim, the single greatest movie ever made, ever. But I don't think Hunnam's got the gravitas to play a full-on leading man, to carry the heft of the film. After all, in Pacific Rim, all the players were the heroes. But he does his job well. And King Arthur wouldn't be king if not for his Knights of the Round Table.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
160,dishlady69,Pretty Bad (No Spoilers),1,27 May 2017,I typically love any story about the Arthurian legends... until now. It's not often you see major characters from the classical stories so badly botched -- and by a director who thinks that those with formal training don't know how to produce a good film. The lack of training shows. Even the Peter Jacksonesque CGI wasn't enough to cover up all the flaws in this one. Wow... WOW.,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
161,Manal1987,Perfect for Mindless Fun...,6,11 May 2017,"I enjoy Guy Ritchie's films the same way I enjoy roller coaster rides at the local theme park. Both are extremely fun, momentarily euphoric but easily forgettable.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is no different, and probably that is why I do not want to join the disappointed angry flocks of critics in bashing the adventure-action drama about a celebrated Medieval folktale. The only reason why King Arthur should be attacked is because it is a typical Ritchie film. Maybe repetitive? Let us not forget that Ritchie has built up his reputation as a divergent director with fast-paced action pieces that offer us a fresh, witty look at low-lives, thugs, and gangsters versus impotent authority. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Snatch (2000), and RocknRolla (2008) are all great films but they won't go down the history of cinema as aesthetically phenomenal. They have started a trend they are fun to watch – and I highly appreciate them for that – but they would never cross the boundaries of entertainment.I really do not understand where the frustration is coming from; Ritchie has probably strayed a bit away from his comfort zone (but hasn't he done that already with Sherlock Holmes?). His style remains the same. King Arthur is another Ritchie-stamped, action-packed drama about low-lives versus authority, only with a mythical twist. The fantasy element may have gone a little off board considering its predecessors but the nonsensical exaggeration is eclipsed by the lavishly piquant editing – a tremendous source of humor in the film.The script seems too cheeky and modern for the time period of the events, but I thought it was refreshingly funny in an unconventional way.Great visuals. Eye-candy cast. Lively humor. What else to look for if you are after a mindless fun movie?P.S. What the hell was David Beckham doing there?",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
162,sanjin_9632,"Way, way, way too much CGI.",5,23 June 2017,"As much as I like Guy Ritchie's movies, this one's a mess. I completely get why it flopped at the box office. The basic story outline had been told so many times before. This movie should've had a smaller budget. It's a perfect example for how less could've been more.Two things that were big obstacles for this movie to be better than average:1. A love interest was missing, which is perplexing since the very beautiful mage (Fresbey) is right there. Also, more banter between the two. Always a good thing, if made right. More funny dialogue in general. There were maybe two funny moments in this.2. The CGI. It's mostly terrible and way too much. Many of the scenes and parts of the story could've worked even without the big snakes, elephants, etc. Some CGI was OK or even good like the things the evil king asked for help, the ones rising from the water beneath the palace when he rang the bell. There were many interesting new ideas. Small details. Parts of the story. Something one would expect from Ritchie, but normally these things fit together. Here, somehow they did not.The budget of this was almost 200 mil, which is absurd. Peter Jackson made the first part of Lord of the Rings for half that. I expected more than this from Ritchie. Normally, the budget would've been enough to make 3-4 blockbusters better than this one. Seems like we're witnessing Ritchie's slow decline.4.6/10 for the ideas.

164,quiqueperezsoler,"Ahead of its time. Misunderstood by many, creativity at its peak rewriting a known story",8,12 March 2020,"MILD MILD SPOILERS AHEAD -- for those who want to know what to expect from the movie but don't want to be spoiled of everything.I must say, when I saw this movie for the first time in the cinema I really didn't like it. It was weird and different to what I have grown accustomed in a bad way. I expected seeing an adventurous movie with fantasy elements and the story I knew retold but updated with good effects. And in a way it does that, but in another there are certain elements that shocked me for how different they were, ranging from the music to some scene execution and story choices.These changes irrupted like loud shocking bombs to deliver a LOTR-inspired aesthetic mixed with, well, a Guy Ritchie dose of rough english heist flowing and story telling techniques. But I didn't see past that, I couldn't bare to ignore those immersive elements to see through what the movie actually did different in a good way: the creative story telling and the dark-ish fantasy subplots.This movie may tell a story we might know well, but it does so with less information than it's build up upon. The world is fully realised in many elements like the Viking characters, the different cities in England and the different ""type"" of people you can find. Instead of having all knights and other kings/prince/princesses rebelling against the crown we got town people like merchants and brothel owners that speak rough and have an incredible dynamic with each other (which in the end would reveal an interesting outcome of their friendship).But there is a certain type of people/character that plays an important role and which was for me a surprisingly eye-grabbing thing: the mage and the fantasy elements involved in her ""subplots"" sort of. I know the Arthurian legend has Merlin and the presence of magic, but this movie trully makes use of it and its purpose to aid the true king. From strange creatures that grant the evil king power in exchange of a heart-wrenching sacrifice to the strange potions and magic that the mage does which grants Arthur the sight to see fantastic creatures living among them or even make him rediscover who he is.The movie presents mages and magic as this sort of ancient thing that was long gone but through the Mage it comes back and its presence is not merely for ornamenting the action and aesthetic appeal but to also serve the story. It has been a while since magic has been used for its true purpose: to guide the humans. Magic in these sort of stories are a very ancient and complex thing not many people can understand, and that's what makes it so powerful and unique. And it's also important to settle its base in nature, that's why potions based on rare flora, controlling animals and enchanted sea creatures are very appealing to our imagination, because they are tangible things or the stuff of myths.Side note: the power they gave the sword may have been a bit too much, but needed for the final confrontation. It gives anime-like action scenes that would leave you breath-taken but it's taken a bit too far. (I personally like it because I'm a sucker for those things)Anyways, IN CONCLUSION, the movie is odd at times for mainstream audiences that are unused to this director's way of story telling. It is aesthetically pleasing with great action and special effects. It has elements that could be considered Dark Fantasy-ish but are toned down gorewise to serve a rating that kids could also see, I guess. The story you already know, they come up with interesting new scenes and probably modifications of the known story that I personally think is well developed for this particular iteration if you don't read too much into it. The ending suffers a little with the ""Big Boss"" finale in the 3rd act (maintaining the epic anime-inspired fight choices) But the best things to take from it are the imagery and aesthetic, costume and props design are great, action scenes and fantasy elements are very creative and unique and the story is basic and to the point. It's retold through a different perspective and new and engaging characters but it never ceases to be the same in its core structure. Some critics have mentioned the phrase ""style over substance"" to describe it and in a way they are correct. But then again, what did you expect of yet another King Arthur-inspired movie? It's in the title!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
165,mgumsley,Ritchie shows again he can think out of the box,7,24 May 2017,"Dispensing with the services of Merlin, bringing the round table in at the end of the film, setting a lot of the action around London, what was Guy Ritchie thinking? He was thinking out of the box, bringing the geezer humour we all enjoy to a much loved English Tale. And I think that he has done it quite well.Yes, the special effects do overwhelm the film at times, especially when we have enjoyed a spell with a bit of masculine banter. It did look very dark throughout.... but this is a dark tale. And Guinevere had none of the chocolate box prettiness and lack of personality we associate with this character. Instead she was a feisty, scheming character more at home dreaming up magic to assist Arthur than in seducing him. Well, given the threats that faced him at this that time, this was a wise decision. And it did make for an interesting and plausible scenario. It was a pity she and Arthur did not get much screen time to explore the chemistry between them, it would have made the characters come to life a little more.I thought Arthur's reluctance to accept his fate was a bit overdone, after all he surely had enough of Uther's blood to make him relish a challenge, but perhaps Ritchie was just upping the ante, in his usual fashion. The humour was a welcome diversion from the action and it is probably the one thing that will send me back to see this again. You rarely find this in fantasy movies and clearly Ritchie gave a lot of thought to this before committing anything to the script. I think this is a refreshing take on the Arthur franchise, if I can call it that, and Charlie Hunnam made an engaging East End Arthur. Even Jude Law could not overshadow him in their scenes together. Bravo Mr Ritchie!!! Any chance of a sequel?Mary Gumsley",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

We all know the story of King Arthur so I don't have to reiterate the content of this disaster. Ok, try to make it creative but when the costumes, makeup etc. is all over the place and no effort to create the period of the story is made, the distractions are unbearable. I'm positive casting Jax from sons of anarchy was supposed to distract everyone from the failed storyline and asthetics of the movie but most people are not that stupid. Why waste so much effort on such a sloppy movie! There are so many scenes where it just doesn't make sense and I couldn't help roll my eyes every few minutes. This is one of those movies where I'm disappointed with fans who liked it. If a few people like garbage like this, then directors will think they can make crap like this and people will buy it. At least make an effort with the correct period costumes and makeup. Oh, I forgot the unbelievable sound track. My son walked in while I was watching the movie and the first thing he noticed was ridiculous music. It just didn't add anything to the movie except to be another distraction. A lot further shows should learn from game of thrones where the music plays a huge part of the series and enhances every scene.

I mainly watched this movie because it was directed by Guy Ritchie and also because of the starcast. King Arthur legend of the sword is not even an ounce short of the entertainment. The movie's story is not something very unusual. One would have pretty much guessed what happens by seeing the trailer. In short, the movie tells the story of betrayal, revenge, friendship and some fantasy. Quirky Guy Ritchie film making induced in a periodic movie is what makes this movie special. Crisp dialogues and dark humour add to the specialty of the movie. There is enough masculinity in the actions sequences much to the liking of fans like me. Visual effect combined with some epic background score gives you all the goosebumps you need. Charlie Hunnam is a tailor made fit for the role. Eric Bana is impressive in his limited screen time. Jude law does the bad guy uncle role with ease. Other supporting characters like Djmon Hounsou, Aidan Gillen and Astrid Berges Frisbey do justice to their roles. Football fans are treated with David Beckham's cheeky role.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is not just an entertaining movie.

169,TheMovonka,A legend reinvented,7,19 May 2017,"Speaking about a King Arthur movie is always linked to comparison. The legend has been told in various ways and key figures, plot and ending is widely known among the audience. As every generation has its impersonated King Arthur, which is Sean Connery for me, Guy Ritchie succeeded in one thing – Reinvention. While we are told the shortened life story of Arthur, true heir of Englands crown, the audience is pulled into a fast and entertaining story telling style full of magic and over the top characters. As the plot starts, it is immediately clear that there is more than the characters tell right now. We see King Uther, simply interpreted by Eric Bana, rescuing his son, fighting with the power of Excalibur and starting the story of how Vortigern enslaves the kingdom. An orphan now, Arthur is adopted by the community of a brothel to start his criminal career in the streets of Londinium. As from now on the story is clear, Arthur is detected as heir, pulls the sword Excalibur from stone and fights for the freedom of his people, the main focus is now on Guy Ritchie. The director shows from this moment of Arthur's rescue the way he goes with us. Entertaining and fast pacing. As the childhood is shown in a speed collage, still the message of the ties between the main character and his people is transported. Continuing by exploring the plot via flashbacks, comedy oriented dialogues and a coolness to loosen up the legendary heroic part, this movie is different than others of its kind. Historic or epic movies with long dialogues, deeply suffering characters or intense stretched situations are not part of this movie. It is recognizable, that Mr. Ritchie does not like these aspects in in general, like seeing the whole childhood of the character for over 30 minutes. He gets to the point and pulls strings in parallel to fasten everything up. This is why you end up in an action movie with swords visualized in the individual way we already saw somehow in Sherlock Holmes. By OK acting from all the main characters and forgettable sidekicks despite for the perfectly cast mage Astrid Bergès-Frisbey, you are taken on an event which never let go from showing the next step, next fight or next revelation. As a lot of CGI complements the concept of the magic based world, King Arthur increases the action and happenings on screen until the third act. Unfortunately, there we have the big issue. As magic and fighting started in an exaggerated way, everything just gets more and more overdone and ends up in a mediocre boss fight. You just saw a final moment of a video game in cinematic environment.Speaking a verdict is still easy. This movie is very well and inventively done with a King Arthur story never told that way. Entertaining and sympathetic characters let time fly to avoid boredom despite the small weakness in the end. But you have to like the style. CGI magic and characters jumping ways over the acceptable top besides the missing parts of what a lot of people love about historic or epic pictures affect most of the negative critiques out there. These people are right, as long as you belong to this audience group. If you are interested in a fast innovative and comedy supported storytelling without much seriousness,happy entertainment to you. Let us see how the audience splits up in lovers and haters, support or hinder the planned sequels and if we see Guy Ritchie's interpretation of the noble knights of the round table fight again. I'd raise my sword for a yes.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

171,trevor-82944,"It's Okay, I Can Wait to Be King",2,12 May 2017,"Okay, so we all kind-of-sort-of-but-not-really know the story of King Arthur: a boy finds a sword in the stone, he pulls it out, he becomes king, yadda-yadda, round table, merlin, holy grail, it's just a flesh wound, you know the drill. Alright fine, I admit I am also unfamiliar, but I at least know it is nothing like this.Too many classic novels have already been ruined by Hollywood's incapacity to win over young people, a trend embraced by King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. I mean, sure. It delivers the stuff teenage boys waste their Saturday nights on, as assumed from the trailer. Half of those teenage boys may feel satisfied; the other half may feel more let down based on what they were promised.The surround sound booms enough epicness to make the theatrical experience more impactful than a Blu-ray experience, but neither format improves the simple action watched on screen. Director Guy Ritchie (The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Sherlock Holmes) sets no demonstrated sense of continuity with screen direction, resorting to cameras on Steadicam to capture the action up close. Edge of Tomorrow's editor James Herbert gives some of the worst splicing and dicing I have ever seen in a movie. While watching the brisk pace of each nonlinear montage, I still fail to know whether if the overused flashbacks are supposed to be funny, sarcastic, or whatever. At least his work here matches the way the crew clearly want their viewers to look upon the Arthurian legend, especially when played against snappy rock music.which explains why they gave their own take to outdo the original. Today's teens graciously get the King Arthur who teams up with men wearing modern-day wool beanies accompanied by a black-eyed sorceress to fight against a fiery demon who rules Camelot using 100-ft. elephants and squid women; you know, the what you naturally think of when you hear about 1,500-year-old legends. Arthur fights plenty of other cool monsters as well, all battles lasting merely a second each, in the form of an unintentionally confusing montage.Even if you have low standards for action scenes, you would never buy into the impossible scenarios, including the now infamous ""chosen one cliché,"" unbelievable by any stretch here. Not convinced yet of King Arthur's textbook approach to screen writing? Perhaps its treatment of women will, who the right-minded men straight-up address as tools. Yes, only two female characters actually try to do something—one a mage who speaks of prophecies and call in deus-ex-machinas birds for weapons. The other just comes in to pass information across different parties. If the producers here are concerned enough about political correctness to cast ethnic actors in a fifth century English setting, you'd guess they would think to write more active female characters.Nothing to get worked up about over any of the stars either, everyone phones it in for the paycheck, including the two-time Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond, In America).So what did I enjoy? Well, in terms of loyalty to the classic retelling, it does feature some uplifting moral parallels left unscathed. Arthur's genesis does reflect some inspiration from the account of Moses, and his rags to riches character arc recalls the accounts of Joseph son of Jacob and David king of Israel. These are timeless inspirational tales about men who plummeted to the bottom then rose to the top to save their nation; King Arthur at least recreates it comprehensibly enough.Sorry, any other praise is asking for too much.You're surely now about to categorize King Arthur: Legend of the Sword as an insult to the influential historical legends, since it revises the strong character growth of a man resembling ourselves, replacing it with hip trends mixed with a bit of New Age Paganism. Well guess what? You're right.Nobody who respects the source material will appreciate such an insult to storytelling; anyone else might either settle for ""good enough"" or protest its failure to distribute the promised action. What we got offers no value except convince me that Ritchie's plan of directing the live-action Aladdin could turn out rather sour.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Something like GOT meets LOTR seems to be the basic premise. Without having the brilliance of either of them. About as realistic as 300, Rise of an Empire which was based on history, poorly. It is all very well to say it is only a legend so Ritchie can do what he likes, but just piling loads of CGI on a story does not make it clever unless of course you are big on CGI, I am not. Monster pythons smashing though palaces and opponents seemingly made out of fire are OK, if you are a preteen. Also what about the multiracial cast? It is like the UN!, and coloured men knighting other men? And what about the dialogue? At one point Hunnam says ""what's up mate"" and his cockney accent is very noticeable.

178,johnplocar,The worst 'epic' I've seen in years.,2,3 January 2018,"I went into ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" not expecting a masterpiece by any means, but I was sold by the trailers for it and thought I was in for a pretty fun flick. I liked the trailers and I've liked most of Guy Ritchie's filmography, setting aside ""Swept Away""...that was bad. I didn't think I was going to dislike this movie as much as I did, to the point where now I've grown to somewhat hate the movie. Out of all the King Arthur related movies I've seen this one I think is the worst of them; whether it be Disney's ""Sword in the Stone"", John Boorman's ""Excalibur"", ""First Knight"" with Richard Gere and Sean Connery, or even Antoine Fuqua's ""King Arthur"" I still believe are better than this and Fuqua's ""King Arthur"" is pretty boring but at least it didn't have editing done by a retarded chimpanzee and characters with less common sense than that.If you don't know the premise it is more or less the same as most of the 'King Arthur' legends that you can find out there. Arthur is the child of King Uther that, for one reason or another, is lost over time following his demise. Years later he finds himself pulling the sword from the stone, revealing to all that he is the true King of Camelot and he must go up against a certain evil to defend it; in this circumstance it is his fiendish Uncle who has taken over the kingdom. There are a lot of similarities as well as differences in this story from past iterations.The film starts out alright with some of its action, but quickly fell apart for me. The story rushes through so many plot points within the first 10 minutes that I could have sworn somebody sat on the remote and accidentally fast-forwarded through an entire film in and of itself. We're introduced to King Uther and his brother (who's name escapes me and I don't care, played respectively by Eric Bana and Jude Law. Right away the story is pretty convoluted, not explaining things straight away that need explanation for later on and even when things are finally explained they don't really make too much sense and it feels out of place. A lot of scenes and sequences feel extremely out of place. We can start off in one scene observing two individuals discussing then in the middle of that discussion cut to one of them in the next scene for all of 5 seconds just sitting not doing anything and then cutting back to the previous scene to finish off the discussion so it can followup with that individual again walking into the place he was sitting in the 5 second clip. Or later on we're following Arthur being saved by a small rebel group from the death sentence given by his Uncle Jude. They travel through miles of the woodlands to finally make it to their hideout where Arthur converses with their leader and in the middle of the conversation the film cuts back to something it initially skipped for literally all of 10 seconds just to cut right back to their conversation. Instances like that are scattered throughout this whole movie and it doesn't come across as stylish, it feels like the editor bashed his face into his keyboard while cutting the film together which resulted in...what a shock...a colossal mess.There is no real fluidity from one scene into the next, it all feels discombobulated and jumbled together so it can not exceed too much over its 2 hour run time limit. Entire story lines and journeys are randomly shoved in and condensed down so drastically it makes me wonder why they were included at all. For instance there's a sequence where Arthur, after being saved from getting his head cut off by order of the Jude man, he must journey through what is called 'the Badlands'. There he faces off against giant mythical creatures and hallucinations that challenge him physically and spiritually; this whole journey could probably make up for an entire film on its own...this movie cuts it down to literally about 1 to 2 minutes...I'm not kidding. All these crazy looking monsters, overwhelming landscapes and surreal mirages he faces is a quick montage. And this isn't the only time the movie does something like this because there is practically an entire movie's worth of backstory pertaining to Arthur's father Uther and his Uncle Judie that is seriously only briefly and confusingly makes its way on screen for maybe 30 seconds or so and is gone as quickly as it arrived. It could have been completely cut out and I would have missed nothing at all, but because I have a feeling that the original script probably had a longer running time in mind but that unfortunately didn't sit well with the studio so they chopped a lot of it down and just stuck the leftovers wherever fit.Because things are so rushed and scenes are placed anywhere like someone aiming at a dart board, the story and the pacing feels so disjointed. Going back and forth between one scene and the next and the previous for no reason and whenever any of the action or violence came about I wanted to set fire to the screen. There is so much erratic camera movement, jumping back and forth between slow-mo and fast-mo, zooming in and out constantly in all of the fight scenes that I just wanted to yell out ""Would someone PLEASE fire this camera operator?!"". So much of it was incomprehensible that I couldn't tell what was going on except for the split seconds it goes back into slow motion to show that someone is being launched into the air or a sword is clashing with another. Then it would zoom in and out, speed up, slow down, speed up, zoom in, out, in, speed up, slow down. It ticked me off big time. Plus it was very apparent that the studio wanted to show as little blood as possible so they cut out 90% of the violence. There are some shots that I could tell that this movie was most likely made to be rated 'R' and so the editor chopped up the movie even more to get away with a 'PG-13' which irritates me to no end. Mainly because what was once likely to be a decently shot violent action film turns into a made-for-television edited nightmare. There are times where it is impossible to tell where someone has been supposedly cut or stabbed or shot because it doesn't show it. In a couple of scenes someone's throat is cut; first time it is completely done out of frame and the other is entirely bloodless. A guy's ear gets cut off, but it is framed where you can't tell for sure and the ear is mostly covered up by another man's hand so you can't even tell what he's holding.There is no reason why a film should ever be chopped up and compromised just so it isn't rated 'R'. If a film is meant to be an 'R' then let it be an 'R'. The rating isn't going to stop the majority who want to see it from seeing it. Last year's ""Deadpool"" is plenty proof of that as well as any given slasher film from the 80s. If people want to see it then they will see it, even kids will find a way. Don't take a film that was written to be a two and a half - three hour hard 'R' epic and shit all over it so you can cut it down to about a two hour run time with neutered action in order to get more screenings and dumb ass kids in seats. All you get out of it is an unholy mess that no one likes...except for the moron sitting a couple seats away from me that was entertained by absolutely everything that made a sound on screen...this guy would have been fascinated by a cup of milk sitting on a table for two hours, that's how dimwitted this man seemed to be.Oh, and the CGI in this movie ranges hardcore. Sometimes the effects looked fine. The opening with the giant elephants was alright as well as one or two things later on. Other than that it looked like garbage. People quickly turn into rubbery cartoons flying around with a bunch of terrible looking smoke and dust effects that made everything look fake. It was terrible. It was like watching the Halle Berry in ""Catwoman"" levels of bad with how obvious it switches from a real person to a CGI plastic puppet. I would have taken traditional 2D animation over some of the CG in this...so bad.There is no reason why this movie should look or feel the way that it does. Whether that be in terms of action and violence being terribly edited, even for a 'PG-13' because I saw ""Kong: Skull Island"" a couple months ago where there was blood flying directly at the camera and limbs being severed left and right and that was rated 'PG-13'. In terms of epics, this should not have been as disjointed and cut down as much as it is since I just saw another version of a Hollywood epic about two weeks ago called ""The Lost City of Z"" which held a real man's journey that felt larger than life and was totally great...also starring Charlie Hunnam who was fantastic in that film and owned every single scene he was in. Hunnam was also good in this, but the movie around him did not hold up.So I say if you absolutely have to see an 'epic' then I implore you to seek out ""The Lost City of Z"" which is a film that feels like a lost epic from the New Hollywood era in the 1970s and early 80s that would have been made by Michael Cimino. If you need a fun modern day action adventure in the theater then go see ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" again because I know you already saw it once. If you want a perfect example of 'PG-13' violent action movies that don't look like something stuffed in a garbage disposal then watch ""Kong: Skull Island"" or 2014's ""Hercules"". Watch anything but this. If you have to see it, wait until it hits DvD where maybe it'll get an extended cut with all the violence not being made for babies.This was really irritating and at times boring to sit through. The story was a mess going back and forth and stuffing in too much in inappropriate and confusing times. The action was not fun to watch or suspenseful. The villain played by the Law of Jude was flat and the two times the movie tried humanizing him made no sense. Backstories and character motivations were all over the place with how little sense they made.The effects were mostly trash. Don't waste your time with this.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
179,joker-scar,Excellent version of the legend,8,2 May 2019,"Like millions of people I love the Arthurian legend. This could have been one of those forgettable remakes...re-boots... whatever label you want to hang on a film that is regurgitating the past to make money but it sets its sights higher for the most part. I would love to give this film a 9 or 10 but have to give it an 8 for a few reasons forthcoming.
Few want to remember Richard Gere's turn at playing the hero King while most should watch John Boorman's excellent and faithful adaption of the Camelot lore in his 1981 film Excalibur. Well worth watching.
This version plays loose with the facts, wait... this is a legend so there are no true facts. Duh! But there are certain mainstays which this director has tossed aside to make this story fresh like his wonderful take on the Sherlock Holmes persona in the last decade. You may like what he added or dislike what he tossed.
The opening scene, like many films in the post Lord of the Rings era, tries so hard to take that crown away with bigger and better stuff hurling at the audience at break neck speed and this film is no different. When you see it you'll know what I mean. After that scene passes then the film really starts to get involving and has great: art direction, locations, story, acting and directing...for the most part. Seems Mr. Ritchie is a very solid director when he wants to until he indulges in his gimmicky novelty directing stuff which pulls me out of the film time and again. This film could really be a great film experience if it weren't for a very small and annoying contemporary feel to either the dialogue, acting or directing that sprouts up now and again spoiling the rest of the film's great energy and flow. Perhaps Ritchie doesn't trust either his own directing skills or, what I suspect more likely... the 21st century Millennial audience's short attention span and lapses into moments of modern filmmaking gimmicks to keep the kittens attention on the bright and shiny object. He has crafted a very compelling and powerful re-imagining of the Arthur legend and doesn't need, like so many other filmmakers these days, have to resort to Matrix-like effects and bullet-time shooting to make this film work. Trust your audience to rise to the occasion and those who don't, they have plenty of other lesser films to keep them in a dull state of arrested development. Well worth watching this film despite the few moments that may or may not pull one out of the viewing experience.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
180,NavyOrion,"Fairly good, but could have been great",6,11 May 2021,"There's a lot to like about this retelling of the classic King Arthur tale: a great cast, good acting, very good script, excellent costumes and set design, and pretty good (if ordinary) effects. In the hands of a less-narcissistic director, it could have been great, an eight or nine-star movie.But in the hands of Guy Ritchie, the film plays like an extended music video, something made by an amateur intent on trying out all the film editing tools on his Windows Video software.The point of making a movie is to tell a story. Except in limited --LIMITED-- circumstances, a story should proceed essentially chronologically. Flashbacks are fine, foreshadowing is fine, but pointlessly hashing together three or four or five scenes just because you're what, bored? That's NOT fine, and is a needless and inconsiderate imposition on your audience: you know, the people who were kind enough to invest their time and money on YUR movie, when there are a lot of others they might watch instead.An example (not really a spoiler, because there's no way to spoil something so out of sequence): at one point, two characters discuss how to force Arthur to commit himself to the power of the sword Excalibur. But rather than following this with the trip to the place where his test will take place, then the various aspects of the test, then the successful completion of said test, we're treated to a mishmash of: an attack by giant rats, the trip, and attack by giant snakes, the trip, the talk, completion, the talk, an attack by giant bats, a flashback to childhood, a dream sequence, the completion of the test, the trip, the talk, more attacks, more dream sequence, etc., etc., etc., all of these cutting in and out for mere seconds, in no particular order, repeating , back and forth, the dialog overcutting different scenes, with the only unifying factor being an annoying incessant taiko drum soundtrack.This isn't ""style,"" it's MASTURBATION.I'm sure all the raw footage still exists somewhere, and I'd love to see this movie re-edited by someone more courteous to his viewers. Sadly, that ain't Guy Richie, and so what might have been a great or at least very good film will be forever stuck in mediocrity.Six stars, and that's only because I feel sorry for the actors and technicians who did their work well, but were probably as disappointed as I am to see what came out the other end of Guy's sausage grinder.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Add to that some pretty visually spectacular magic CGI-effects (the mage's eyes transforming into the eyes of whichever animal she's controlling was a very creative effect I've never seen before) and highly stylized action fight scenes, reminiscent of Zack Snyder movies, with their wild camera movements and extreme zoom-ins and slow-mo effects and you have a thoroughly entertaining movie.

184,graves-scott,They may as well have used guns...,1,8 November 2021,First off. The era of King Arthur of Camelot was 500 AD or there abouts. If you arent using the tech and culture of that era for the backdrop then you arent making a King Arthur movie. Just like a Robin Hood movie without the background of the Crusades isnt a Robin Hood movie.The guards used a kind of firework arrow to signal closing the gates and to track the heroes. Firewoks hadnt even been invented in China at that point. Before that the archer uses a small telescope to get a better look. The lenses for such scopes wouldnt be invented for another 1000 years.500 AD was long before vikings raided england much less were making deals with various lords. Also there were no people of color in england at that time.With all those anachronisms the guards may as well have carried M-16 rifles and wore kevlar body armor.

So he is depicted as a bratty little criminal (who gets bigger) whose character flaws are perhaps the direct result of having been raised by prostitutes. REALLY? Of course, we have to have the diversity cast, which, frankly, does a much better acting job than several of the big name stars. But the punch line is that professional critics were, at best, irritated...and the public refused to pay good money to see another Western Icon trashed. Despite spending over one third of the total budget on marketing, the movie keeled over like a beached whale.

That part of the story has been covered in modern times by movies and books.

That's the only way I can explain how so many people are giving this movie gushing 10/10 reviews.For me, it was a largely vapid CGI-fest completely devoid of realism or reality. It's pretty much on par with your latest superhero / Avengers type of movie, with fast cut action sequences, explosions, things flying around the screen, and stylized slow motion. I expected more than this from Guy Ritchie.I also didn't expect it to be so much of a ""fantasy"" film. I was expecting / hoping for a historical action movie but there is almost no history here. Everything is stylized and made up. The armour and weapons are all made up, the castles are unbelievable and fantastic (huge towers, arches, 1000 ft bridges, etc), African and Asian characters have been inserted, and there are almost no historical references.So it all kind of mashes together into 2 hours of fantasy-action featuring characters you don't really care about and that have no grounding in any reality that seems to make sense. And you can tell they want to turn this into a franchise with several more sequels.

Though that isn't saying much. This movie is just pure entertainment as the eighties movie was. And other than a few correct names, this is more about turning Arthur into Thor, in a Marvel flick, and Excalibur substituting for Mjolner the hammer. If Arthur really existed, he was a Roman war leader, left behind as token protection by the roman legions. And his name was probably Artos or Artu. No magic, no Merlin, just a soldier or war leader. But Mort de Arthur by Mallory in the 1500's right up to today and this flick, was never about reality. It was more about morality, and good versus evil. And the deeds of the knights, and the temptations they encountered. Gawains honor, Tristan's love, Lancelot's sin and failure, and the success of his son Percival as redemption. Star Wars has taken the place of Arthur and his knights, in the minds of people today, as a way to hold back the darkness that is a part of all of our lives. But one thing is certain, as this movie's very existence shows. As in Mallory's story, even if not told as in this movie, Arthur will never die.

193,lumieretrain,King Arthur: Legend of the Sword by Guy Ritchie,8,18 May 2019,"King Arthur is a character who has always attracted, the fans of books, television series, movies and comic books. As King Arthur's story has been adapted either in the historical way or in the fantasy way, to see how the main character would become the king of Britons. Through the journey, Arthur would use the legendary sword Excalibur, by extracting it from a stone as he is the worthy one to take the sword. Then King Arthur would congregate with his knights, including Lancelot and Tristan, around the Round Table. The filmmaker Guy Ritchie seems interested to tell the story of King Arthur, in a different way than it has been usually told. As he decided to use fantasy elements for his movie, by making the story spectacular with a non stop thrilling rhythm. In 2017 came out King Arthur: Legend of the Sword by Guy Ritchie with Charlie Hunnam, Jude Law, Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey, Djimon Hounsou and Eric Bana. The movie's plot: Once Vortigern (Jude Law) has murdered his brother Uther (Eric Bana), he takes the throne of the Castle Camelot to become the king of Britons. But Arthur, the son of Uther, got saved in Londinium, where he grows up by the prostitutes and become a man (Charlie Hunnam) of the streets. Once Arthur showed to be the worthy one to extract the sword Excalibur by the stone, he would learn the reason he has to gain the throne again. Guy Ritchie and the screenwriters did a long research for the movie, to make the story intriguing as it mentions other important elements about King Arthur's legends. The director uses his style by making the movie dynamic, through the editing and rhythmic dialogues to catch the audience attention. The action sequences were dynamically shot and directed, to give thrilling tension in the most unexpected moments of the movie. The costumes were elaborated to build the armor of the knights and the dresses of the people, like they were dressed and designed in the medieval. The make-up was particularly elaborated, to make look the wounds also the old ones as realistic as possible. The special effects were constructed in every single details, by making the story spectacular and visceral for audience. The lightings helped to make the scenes atmospheric, in every single angle shots of the camera. Charlie Hunnam was excellent as King Arthur a character, who initially has difficulties to accept the destiny which he must follow. Until something would make him understand, the reason which he has to gain the throne again, to then fight against the evil with all of his strength. Jude Law was really good as Vortigern who is a cold and cruel villain, to have no mercy with anyone who would try to interfere with the throne. In the course of the story Vortigern would take straight decisions, even his hands would be filled with blood. Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey did a well done job as the Mage, who has extraordinary supernatural powers and she would guide Arthur to his destiny. The score by Daniel Pemberton was elaborated to be unforgettably rhythmic and epic, in every note to be listened. Especially on the tracks like ""The Devil and the Huntsman"", which Sam Lee sings the track's lyrics to be compatible with the following story. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is one of the best Guy Ritchie's movies, with a non stop thrilling rhythm.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

But once he pulls the sword from the stone, his life is turned upside down and he is forced to acknowledge his true legacywhether he likes it or not.Amongst the other actors / actresses in King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword include Spanish actress Astrid Bergès-Frisbey (Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Juliette) as The Mage, Benin actor Djimon Hounsou (Guardians Of The Galaxy, Gladiator) as Bedivere, Republic Of Ireland actor Aidan Gillen (TV Series Game Of Thrones, The Dark Knight Rises) as Bill, English actor Freddie Fox (The Three Musketeers 2011, Pride) as Rubio, Craig McGinlay as Percival, Tom Wu (Kick-Ass 2, Revolver) as George, Kingsley Ben-Adir (UK TV Series Vera, Trespass Against Us) as Wet Stick, English actor Neil Maskell (Basic Instinct 2, High-Rise) as Back Lack, English actress Annabelle Wallis (Annabelle, X-Men: First Class) as Maggie, English actor Geoff Bell (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Kingsman: The Secret Service) as Mischief John, Poppy Delevingne the older sister of English actress Cara Delevingne as Igraine, English actress Millie Brady (Legend 2015, Pride And Prejudice And Zombies) as Catia, Wil Coban as Brother Blackleg, English actor Bleu Landau (UK TV Series EastEnders as Dennis Rickman Sharon Mitchell's little son) as Blue Back Lack's son, English actress Jacqui Ainsley as Lady Of The Lake, Georgina Campbell (UK TV Series Broadchurch and Flowers) as Kay, Rob Knighton (Anti-Social, Everyone's Going To Die) as Mordred, Michael Hadley (Diana, Pirate Radio) as Mage King, Former England, Man Utd, Preston, Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan, PSG football player David Beckham as Trigger, Republic Of Ireland actress Katie McGrath (Jurassic World, TV Series Supergirl) as Elsa, British actor Peter Ferdinando (High-Rise, Ghost In The Shell 2017) as Earl Of Mercia, Republic Of Ireland actor Michael McElhatton (TV Series Game Of Thrones, The Zookeeper's Wife) as Jack's Eye, Swedish actor Mikael Persbrandt (The Hobbit films, The Salvation) as Greybeard, Charlie Rawes (It Never Sleeps, Skiptrace) as Axeman, James Warren as Mike, Ellie Graham (UK TV Series Casualty and Doctors) as Maria, Robbie Carpenter (UK TV Series Endeavour and Doctors) as Street Blackleg and Kamil Lemieszewski as Merlin.Filming locations in King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword include England, Scotland, Wales.Overall King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword is an alright film filled with action scenes, violence, sword fighting, stunning scenery, turbulent weather like heavy rain, fall outs, family, friendship, team work, togetherness, loyalty, backstabbing, betrayal, treachery, animals like viper snakes, elephants, horses etc, weapons like swords, bows, arrows etc, waterfalls, boats, things happening in slow motion, stabbings, slashings, killings, powerful stuff and many other things throughout the film.So I will give King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword an overall rating of 2 out of 5 stars since the plot of the film is quite thin despite the film boasting / having a good cast in it and King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword is similar to films like King Arthur from 2004, Warcraft: The Beginning, the Hercules films, Seventh Son, Troy, Alexander, 300 films, Centurion, Robin Hood films, Pompeii, The Eagle, Braveheart, The Great Wall amongst others.So you can pick and choose whether you want to go and see King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword in the cinema or not and if you are a fan of these kind of films.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
196,cliff_bd,Great Movie!!,9,29 May 2017,"**Some Spoilers**When I saw that Guy Richie directed this movie I made a point of going to the Cinema to see it.I was not disappointed, When I go to the movies I want to be entertained. This movie entertained me with action and humor. The film was very well paced and did not have a slow point that so many movies today seem to have.When remaking classics such as Arthur, a certain amount of artist license must be expected - I don't see the point of making another King Arthur movie that sticks closely the classic story (and there has been a fair few over the last 30 - 40 years) - and indeed with Guy Richie directing the movie I expected the movie to be unorthodox and unconventional. In short this a Great movie, which I highly recommend.... its a shame the movie bombed at the box office, it did not deserve to.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
197,joejasso-70-399261,Beautiful CGI,5,2 July 2019,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword may be the worst marketed film ever. Not that it was a good movie, but based off of its trailers I did not know it was a fantasy film. The CGI is beautiful and the best video game film I have ever seen, with that said, why the hell did the studio hide what was the bulk of the $175 million investment!? My review of the film? Only watch the first five minutes and you will walk away impressed and satisfied. Watch the entire film and pay the price for trusting Guy Ritchie and his bag of tricks he calls ""filmmaking.""",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
198,paulspencer-90394,I would rather be in Hamalot,4,25 June 2017,"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy were great movies, worth seeing time and time again. They were well directed, well acted, and at their heart it was a great story. Maybe if you asked a child what they liked they might have said, the large elephants. Well, this is the basis for Legend of the sword.The opening battle lets you know that this is a big budget with little ideas. Having knowledge of the Arthurian legend, I understood who some of the characters were, and what the story would be about. The problem was, after thirty minutes I did not know what was happening, worse, I did not care.The young Arthur ends up in London. Surprisingly, no one ever says, 'Hey, remember that fight with those giant elephants?' So now we must just be in old normal times. There is still a bit of magic going on here and there, you got a budget to blow so why not. Then Arthur ends up joining a queue to pull the sword out of the stone, watched by David Beckham. By now I really missed those big elephants.You then have over an hour of Arthur having to sort out the pretend King Jude Law. Guy Ritchie's style means there is plenty of verbal word play, a bit of fast editing, and pretty much no women involved, apart from some witchy bird who keeps popping up to save the day using snakes and eagles.Arthur then kills a giant masked warrior (remember Lord of the rings, the bit after the giant elephants, and the end (which is meant to tie in with the next film) is the revealing of the round table.So what went wrong? It wasn't super bad. Any story can be adapted. But maybe if you had made Arthur struggle to find out who he really is draw the sword in the last act it might have made more sense. If you had done a Star Wars and given the comedic element over to two servants, it might have given more empathy for the hero. And really, if you had said 'Don't spend the cgi budget on giant elephants, instead lets do a battle scene with a thousand real people, it might of given the film a bit more of a human touch. As I say, not a bad film, just not a good version of an old story.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
199,celtic451-228-782719,Interesting take on King Arthur,10,20 August 2017,"This may be the best King Arthur movie I've ever seen. It's a very interesting take on the Arthur legend, but still, it did keep true to the basic legend, especially the sword. I've seen many Arthur films where they virtually ignore the sword, but this film is the best I've seen as far as the representation of the sword. The dialogue is witty and the action is fast. The strangest aspect of the film is how Arthur is more like a London street punk from the 1990's. Even though, the last fight scene is the best part of the film and the best and truest I've seen for Excalibur.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The movie is visual overwhelming with big action-scenes but it is even for a King Arthur-movie way too much nonsense magic. A giant snake, unbelievable power coming from the sword, some kind of octopus with human tentacles with heads of women, the transfer of Vortegem into some kind of fire-demon? Come on, what a lot of bullshit.... No, as said: visual it is great and some scenes were nice to watch including the end-scenes but in total not a very good movie. Not bad but not one that you will remember as being a big hit.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
204,MichaelNontonMulu,An Entertaining Adaptation of King Arthur & Excalibur Sword,8,11 May 2017,"Wow, this is one heck of a movie. I was overwhelmed with some of the scenes, especially the fighting scenes in the beginning, the middle and also in the end. There was a wonderful opening credit scene which I felt was very awesome. It lasted probably only 5 minutes but it really impressed me. And, the movie also had some brief parts which were fun to see, like the scene when Arthur was telling the story about the Vikings. Out of the whole fighting scenes, the one that I enjoyed most was in the middle which I felt was rather breathtaking and having an ultimate amazing ending.Apart from the cool action sequences, the movie also had some dramatic moments and surprises. I really think that the way Guy Ritchie directed this movie made it very enjoyable. I did feel some similarities with other movies that he directed like the 2009 Sherlock Holmes movie and its sequel Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows in 2011, especially in the part of using pieces of flash backs to explain something.I think the special effects to the movie was very good, which should not be a surprise considering it has a USD 175 million budget. My only worry is with such hefty budget, it may not be having a large profit since the movie itself might not appeal to some hardline fans of the folklore of King Arthur, Excalibur, mages and so on, due to the rather unusual way of story telling. Some people might also feel that the movie lacks the cruelty & violence of a medieval era war kind of movie such as Kingdom of Heaven or Game of Thrones TV series. For my personal view though, this movie was just nice since its attraction is certainly on the way the story being told, and again, its fighting sequence. The sound effects of the movie were very good. Some background music truly gave extra sense of suspense or sadness and so on. The duration of 2 hours was just perfect to me, and I honestly felt there was no dull moment. There was no post-credit scene for you to wait, except if you enjoy listening to the soundtrack song & music. Before I forgot, there was a cameo appearance of the popular soccer player David Beckham. Let's see if you noticed him.So for those who want to enjoy a nice action adventure film in the medieval period with some sword and sorcery plus the background of King Arthur with the knights of the round table, then you would definitely enjoy this one (especially if you are a fan of Guy Ritchie's works). Now if you are not a fan of this kind of movie or you prefer a more bloody/violent movie, then perhaps this one would be a bit soft.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
205,rebeccalucy,A little bland...,3,29 December 2017,"Very underwhelming and a little dull in its execution. The style presented does not fit the medieval setting, as it feels far too modern. It really takes away from some of the great costumes and set pieces. Furthermore, the fast paced editing feels so out of place. It tried to do something unique but it simply did not work, the editing skips over the main character's development that could of made the audience more invested. However, the costumes and some effects are very good. Most of it must be inspired by Game of Thrones and Lord of the rings, as it seems to borrow heavily from certain ideas. Some of the acting was decent, but not many are given much to do or say. David Beckham cameo seems a little strange but does not ruin the film. Overall, mostly dull but is an okay action flick for the forgiving.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Critics and apparently audience(not the audience I was in) loved it! I thought it was hands down one of the worst things I've seen from the comic book genre.King Arthur? Trashed by the critics, supposedly tanks at the box office(although American box office doesn't mean ish anymore.) and I flippin LOVED IT! The first 35 minutes in my pulse starts racing a bit because I'm thinking to myself...dude..this is pretty good! Can it follow through? Can it be good all the way through..unlike that wonder garbage that tanked after 25 minutes? Why yes, yes it did!Look, I'm not exactly a Charlie Hunnam cheerleader. I loved him in Green Street Hooligans but never jumped on the Sons bandwagon. This was Green Street Hooligans(one of my favorite films ever) in Medieval times. This was adult fantasy not for these childish comic book dweebs.This was Guy Ritchie's London thug take on the old tale. I enjoyed almost every bit of it! Now I say almost because the final showdown..like most final showdown's in these big budget hero flicks are always duds!(Im lookin at you BVS) But like BVS...this is for adults!I finally get why BVS had bad reviews and King Arthur did too..I also get why an abomination like Wonder Woman has enjoyed such love--CHILDREN. Children are going to see these movies. Goons, that love obvious and cliché everything. Goons that love lots of color and pizazz but have no sex lives.My point and honestly I thought i learned this in high school but THINK for yourself.

208,ReelLifeReviews,Worth the wait,8,16 May 2017,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword - An absolute bomb at the box office that will LOSE Warner Brothers over $100 MILLION. That is a flop of epic proportions. And you know what? I loved it.This film had its release date pushed back three different times, making its debut almost a year after the initial target. A similar situation befell Jupiter Ascending, and I literally couldn't even finish that movie. Each one was marred by post-production issues and, as of this writing, they share the same Rotten Tomatoes score of 26% from critics.Before I heard about the delays, I was initially doubtful about it due to the fact that Guy Richie was tabbed to direct. His style is so brash with the quick cuts and rapid-fire dialogue, it just didn't seem to fit the content. He definitely makes it clear who is at the helm in a few scenes, but for the most part he allows the story to speak for itself.As for the words being spoken, the writing wasn't all that strong. I can't really quote any lines or recall any clever moments of dialogue. There are missed opportunities for levity that were either drawn out too long, or just poorly set up. It was a pretty vanilla script to be honest.What's built around that script however is what makes this movie so enjoyable. In normal circumstances I would say that the visual effects were a bit lacking, but I found myself buying them because of the world that was established. It's very magic-centric, so elements didn't need to necessarily look 'real' since, well, they weren't. And how have I gone this long without talking about the music?? The soundtrack added an incredible amount to the overall product. I was tapping my toes throughout.King Arthur surprised me in many different ways. I mentioned it when checking into the theater, but I thought this was going to be a lock to make my 'Worst Of' list. Now? Not a chance. 7.5/10",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
209,LadyJackal,Eric Bana and Lude Law rock!,10,8 August 2021,"But Erics character died in the first scenes, and Jude is the star of this one specific movie aka underrated gem...Jude was playing the antagonist . Especially the last 40 minutes was very exciting. I loved our Arthur, but I wondered if Eric had played Arthur, how would it have been.. anyways, it's a shame that Merlin's name is not mentioned. I expected it to have a sequel which had more Merlin, but I see that even the sequel is canceled! My God, this series doesn't deserve that, while so many stupid movie series continue.Other than that, the mage's actress could have been cast as Guinevere directly.. it was very nice that the knights got names at the end, I saw no Lancelot, Gawain, etc, though.The music was great, I definitely recommend this movie. I missed some subtitles , this is the reason why I cut 1 point from the movie, Mr. Ritchie never thought of the foreigners who might watch the movie...He unfortunately made the characters talk too quickly... I wish this movie was shot slowlier; but if it's the director's own style, I can't say anything...I lastly think he could ask for permission to make this movie longer & explain the subject in a more-detailed way.. because the movie ends with Arthur, becoming the king; so it really can go on longer. It's still a shame it didn't continue and we could not see more of the adventures of the Knights of the Round Table..",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

213,shawthingproductions,A disappointing mess.,1,18 May 2017,"There are very little redeeming qualities about this mess of a film, and it really is a mess. If I had to walk away with a positive though, I would say the music was pretty good for the most part. So where to start.The acting from Charlie Hunnam (I loved him as Jax Teller) is laughable. Almost as laughable with how ""pretty"" he was in one of the final fight sequences of the film even though he had just taken a pasting. He is so wooden, so unbelievable that it is hard to take him seriously or believe anyone would follow him. It helps then that the rest of the acting is shoddy too. The female mage is so flat she may as well be horizontal. David Beckham's cameo is out of place and painful and... Well what did you expect when they saw fit to employ ""Denny from Eastenders""? The lad can't act in the soap, let alone a movie. Any time a soap actor appears in a ""blockbuster"" I get that sinking feeling... Let's not forget that Charlie started in Byker Grove though but we can't hold that against him. We can hold this film against him.Jude Law was decent enough, stepping away from his usual type of character. One of the only characters you could believe in but one you're not supposed to like. The problem being, as he is the only believable character in the film - you can't help but root for him.The rest of the performances were paint by numbers, collecting a pay check and if this was the best Guy Ritchie could get from them - perhaps he isn't fit for being a director? And - to be fair - he probably isn't. At least, this type of film. He nailed Snatch and Lock, Stock - that much is a given and there are traces of that directorial style in this film (characters recalling stories and flitting between them talking and flash back sequences for example) but the problem is - it felt forced and out of place here. Put with that the fact Guy simply cannot direct action - you have a problem. It felt like two films. One film where you can get suckered in with the stories the characters are telling and the other, you're wishing your life away watching rubbish CGI, limp acting and a muddled mess of a fight sequence. Seriously - why so many slow motion shots of Charlie cutting through wood?!In one scene where he uses the sword, it happened so fast that I still don't really know what happened. And the fight at the end? I still don't know who hit who for the best part of it. Although, given how pristine Charlie looked afterwards, I am guessing he had time to pop off to a spa whilst the Big Bad fought alone. The script is as much to blame as the cast and crew though. It's a mess, jumbled up with too many dialogue sections spliced with flashbacks that aren't necessary. For this kind of film - perhaps a more linear story would have made more sense? As mentioned above, it felt like a film of two halves because of the constant jumping back and forth and switching to medieval sword play. It was also trying to be funny when that too missed the mark. The audience laughed a couple of times (a couple more than myself) but that was it. This is the first time I have stepped from a Guy Ritchie film and felt such bitter disappointment. Had this been someone's first film, I doubt they would ever work again.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
214,timrossminister,Well acted rubbish,4,13 June 2019,"Yes, the acting is good, the vfx are A1 and they're is certainly a lot of action, but honestly, if you've seen Lord of The Rings and the TV series of Robin Hood with Jonas Armstrong (who will now think of all the way through) then you'll have seen this film.
It borrows soooo much from Lord of the Rings (""be they oliphants Mr Frodo?"") and then gives it a sort of London Eastend bad lads twist in an attempt to make it seem more 'real', which it doesn't, it just makes for a jarring contrast to the sword-and-sorcery style story.
Still, the actors look like they fun getting mucky and bloody though.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
215,kythia,Clever new take on an old Saga,8,21 August 2019,"Great actors, great soundtrack, and an innovative way of storytelling.From the recap of Arthur's youth to the ""let me tell you how this would go down""-scenes it reminded me a bit of Scrubs, which showed visions of how things would happen instead of just letting characters talk about it.It gets a bit stale towards the very end since we all know who will win, the CGI could be better given its budget, and I wish the gorgeous mage had more screentime, but this film deserves much more recognition than it got thanks to its release alongside Wonder Woman and bad marketing. The ""official"" trailer is terrible, but the comic-con trailer is great, for example.Definitly worth a look now that its on Netflix.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

219,Alex_Kladis,Quick Review,4,17 October 2018,"""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" has great potentials but a bit so good execution! It's one big problem it's its script. Especially, the first half hour and the last half hour are pretty much and non-linethe mess, with random elements come and go (a giant snake above them all!) and a not so clearly story!
Also the editing, though not bad for a heist movie, it wasn't the best choice for that historic-fantasy story. And yeah, it made the scenes grounded, but with no follow-up, it's seemed as a random Editing method!Although the acting wasn't that great, it's wasnt bad either and the overall Picture had some great Scores and Songs, so... you have that to look forward!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

But once he pulls the sword from the stone, he is forced to acknowledge his true legacy - whether he likes it or not.I saw this at a free advanced screening two weeks before it came out, and I was shocked at how horribly edited this film was, it was appalling. The acting and ESPECIALLY the storytelling and the effects are just awful and cringe-worthy to sit through. The only positive thing I can say is djimon Hounsou at least tried to give a performance unlike everybody else in this film. Charlie Hunnam was bland, uncharismatic, and dull as Arthur and Jude Law was especially awful as the king basically auditioning for an Uwe Boll film that will never get made.I am honestly surprised, because I've liked Sherlock Holmes and definitely liked The Man From Uncle from Guy Ritchie, but this managed to make Sherlock Holmes 2 look good and I don't know how that is even possible, but I would rather watch that since that at least felt like a Guy Ritchie movie, this only felt like one of his films in 2 scenes and that's it.Overall, Skip this film it is not worth your time watch Excalibur, The Sword and the Stone, First Knight, and hell even the Antoine Fuqua one.

Action packed and full of cheeky comments. Remember this is a Guy Richie film. Which is known for crazy camera angles, fast wit and creative writing. Is Charlie Hunnam the greatest actor on the planet, no but he carries this film well. I do wonder where he buys his hair gel in Camelot. Even after all these years it's still hard to shake off Charlie's Sons of Anarchy character Jax, and especially to hear him with his native British accent. It almost sounds fake. Move past that and just enjoy an action film with witty writing. Lots of names made their way into this film either in speaking roles or just cameos. So that was fun to figure out where you have seen that face before. All in all an enjoyable way to spend 2 hours, and it was a full 2 hours.

Now maybe you think that is an insult, or maybe you think it is a compliment. But I see it as a net positive. Breathing some new life into the tale of Camelot. One of the most told and retold stories in Western literature.Remember, the stories of Camelot were built up over centuries.The 12th-century French writer Chrétien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature. In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the legend continues to have prominence, not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media.and then this ...Le Morte d'Arthur (originally spelled Le Morte Darthur, ungrammatical Middle French for ""The Death of Arthur"") is a 15th-century Middle English prose reworking by Sir Thomas Malory of tales about the legendary King Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table-along with their respective folklore. In order to tell a ""complete"" story of Arthur from his conception to his death, Malory compiled, rearranged, interpreted and modified material from various French and English sources. Today, this is one of the best-known works of Arthurian literature. Many authors since the 19th-century revival of the legend have used Malory as their principal source.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Didn't watch it for a while subject to universally negative reviews, and all that, however I actually really quite liked it. It's no masterpiece, certainly not, but it's really good fun. High fantasy combined with more traditional Guy Ritchie, a bit of fantasy Guy Ritchie minus Disney at the helm (as with Aladin). Not even completely disposable fun, I might even watch it again.I think it would have been better recieved had it not been a movie. It originally consisted of 3.5 hours (I read somewhere), chopped down to 2, and I think if they didn't cut it down so much and made a mini series of it it would have done very well indeed!

224,stellansson,Change of haircut?,5,18 May 2020,"A bit of a boring but still entertaining movie. I just wish that Charlie Hunnam could change his hair style from when he starred in sons of anarchy. Hunnam is not a bad actor in my opinion, but I do think that he has to change his looks a bit in-between movies. If this movie did more to portray the early days of Arthur rather than pointless battles I would have rated it higher, since this was a novel take on the Arthur saga.On a final note, in my opinion, as a person being born in Scandinavia, you would never see Vikings bow down as easily as that. Assimilated? Yes! Bow down? Never! :)",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

226,said-buet10,By far the worst from Guy Ritchie,2,28 July 2017,"As a director Guy Ritchie is one of the most entertaining one. I've liked all of his movies up till I've seen this mess. He followed the same formula of story telling he used in 'Snatch', 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' or some of his other movies but this time everything fell apart. It was downright annoying how ridiculous it looked on this story. I found it astonishing when I saw a lot of the Ritchie fan cheering these Ritchie trademark editing, flashbacks!! Even a fanboy should know when their favorite director screwed up.When I'm writing this this movie has 7.1/10 rating!! surely it will go down in future.Apart form the direction the story was far from interesting. Nothing interesting or exciting rather a predictable dull cliché. The CGI is good. The continuous camera following fighting shots were something new.If you stop thinking about what Ritchie made before and think about just this one...only then you would see this is a very very bad movie.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
227,cary_howe,I didn't make it five minutes in,3,2 May 2021,About the time 100' tall elephants that looked suspiciously like the ones in the Lord of the Rings movies showed up I was done. Not in the mood for a LOTR knock off with twice the budget. Exhausted from all the high budget rip offs! If you have that much money can't you hire a writer to come up with something original? I like Charlie Hunnam but he's becoming a sign of films to avoid. Everything I try to watch him in sucks. You need to pick your parts better or you'll wind up doing soap operas.,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
228,templar77099,Average,6,7 August 2017,"Well, its what you'd expect from a spring blockbuster plus Richie's own unique style and flair. I just don't know why it was so poorly received. Its by no means a masterpiece but on the other hand, its quite distant from being a worthless piece of cinema. Its enjoyable at times, specially in the Excalibur bit - until the moment, by the second moment Arthur uses it, that you realise the effects are absolute crap that came from a ten year old video game.Gets points for the humour and the coolness - all of those are inherent to Charlie Hunnam, although his performance is, most of the time, just average - but nothing more.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
229,lawrenceconwayvulcan,By the power of Excalibur,8,19 May 2017,"King Arthur:Legend of the Sword is the first film about the Arthur legend to really go into the mystical element since John Boorman's Excalibur to focus on the fantasy elements of the myth.Charlie Hannam's Arthur is a cross of Hamlet, Moses and He-Man. Sent into exile by the murder of his family by his evil Uncle played by Jude Law. The film kicks into gear when that famous moment when Arthur pulls the sword out of the stone, we get a succession of set pieces that catch the eye. This must be the first film to show that Excalibur is more than just a sword as when Arthur lays waste to scores of enemies when wielding it.This is a film that is a good time if you are in the mood for it.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
230,fewald139,The movie that renewed my interest in cinema...,10,2 August 2019,"Before King Arthur, I'd never seen a Guy Ritchie film. In fact, I went years without seeing many movies at all because I was consistently disappointed by at least one aspect of each film until it ruined the experience for me and I got sick of the medium entirely. When the King Arthur trailer debuted, I watched it and was instantly fascinated. For the first time in eight years, I dragged my husband to the cinema.King Arthur has the right mixture of jaw-dropping fantasy visuals, interesting camerawork (which I have since learned is Ritchie's signature style), gorgeous sound design and musical soundtrack (my favorite ever), and quirky, likable characters. Its non-stop pace ensured it was the first movie not to ever bore me once. Its villain (played by Jude Law) is refreshingly layered, and Hunnam's Arthur--while being a hero--thankfully stays far away from the boring goody-two-shoes trope that is so old and tired in the fantasy genre I wish it'd stay six feet under. The only qualm with the movie I have is that it wasn't rated R; the action scenes are shockingly immersive, unique, and gritty for a movie in any genre, but that could have made for some amazing blood and gore had Warner Brothers allowed it. Nevertheless, King Arthur is the only movie in the history of cinema that makes me tear up every time I watch it because it feels simply epic. The combination of unbeatable compelling action scenes and top notch medieval soundtrack gets to me like nothing else ever has.While I'm certain I'll get tons of ""unhelpful"" reviews simply for having this opinion, I want to post this if only to give my thanks to Guy Ritchie and the crew of this movie for working hard to make his vision come to life. Though King Arthur did not succeed financially (and that physically pains me, as someone who was lucky enough to experience it in the theater on three occasions), you made a movie that has me EXCITED to see movies again. Since King Arthur, I've watched hundreds. And while none have come close to this movie's wavelength, I'm not so fatigued with the search anymore. Because I now know truly awesome movies can exist, so it gives me the determination to find them.Don't see King Arthur if you believe fictional mythical stories cannot be tweaked or twisted. Don't see King Arthur if you are looking for a run of the mill ""sunshine and rainbows"" kind of fantasy movie where there are no deaths, no nuances, no grit, no realistic consequences. See King Arthur if you are looking for a truly special piece of art to experience in every aspect. Words cannot aptly describe how much I love this movie, but I pray this review convinces at least one person who will treasure it to discover it.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
231,neoclone07,Were Guy Ritchie on drugs?,4,28 June 2017,"I always loved Guy Ritchie work. First time I watched Snatched, I got amazed with the fast paced action-packed scenes, funny dialogues and the real life characters. Then I watched Rock'n'rolla and became a fan of his style. Watched Lock, stock and two smoking barrels. Then Sherlock Holmes left me a bit of sceptic (as a reader of the books), but the formula worked again. Guy was able to capture a dirty, foggy, underground victorian London and Robert Downey Jr was superb as SH. But, the formula didn't work this time. Come on, giant (bigger than those from LOTR) elephants in medieval England?? King Arthur as a pimp? That crazy women cthulhu-like (I liked them, actually, but there's no such creature in King Arthur's lore)? Taggers around London? David Beckham??? Dude, what the heck? Alright, the FX are awesome, indeed. The slow motion battle scenes are cool, I liked them, for real, but, man, King Arthur's legend is something to take seriously. The movie simply creates an entire new character. Not to mention Arthur's thugs (knights?) names... Back Lack, Wet Stick, Mischief John? The same style he's used to on his previous movies simply does not apply here. It's a (bad) mix that didn't went well.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

233,ms_jade_li,Charlie Hunnam Perfect as King Arthur,8,26 May 2017,"What drew me to the theater to see King Arthur was, hands-down, Charlie Hunnam. I loved the idea of seeing a Jaxian, Raleighsian King Arthur, and I was not disappointed. I loved the gratuitous flesh shot where he took his shirt off after waking up sweat-drenched from a nightmare. That shot alone was worth the price of admission :) King Arthur is more than just a sassy pretty boy doing stunts though. I loved the hero's journey, from his toddlerhood to when he pulls the sword from the stone. I really like the way they show his community connections through his upbringing, developing the character he would need to claim his rightful throne.Before I wrote this review I was going to say that I thought his fellow rebels were underutilized in King Arthur; however, reading some of the data at this site, I see that a series of 6 films is planned, so there is plenty of time for character development. I really hope they keep the same cast as they are quality. I love the way the mage is portrayed and I love her voice!!!!!!!! There is an exotic, hypnotic quality to it. I loved the shred of humanity they gave to the evil brother/uncle/king. Anyone with the capacity for love cannot be totally evil. Jude Law was realistic in his portrayal of the power-crazed monarch.The soundtrack of King Arthur is superior throughout and in some scenes is mystically charged. It resonates with the collective unconscious.Just as magnificent as the soundtrack is the gorgeous terrain! If you love rocks, boulders, bluffs, and vast sweeping landscapes you will fall over sideways seeing it here.Through much of King Arthur there are grave missions, but the film does capture an admirable amount of levity in the face of gravity.I've seen some critical comments regarding the end battle scene. I thought it was beautiful and powerful.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

235,Big_D_Box_Office_Score,Better than expected,7,11 May 2017,"BDBOS Reviews: King Arthur: Legend of the SwordShow of hands - how many of you out there are thinking about catching this movie? Probably not many. Expectations are pretty low for this movie, mainly because of it's generic look, somewhat unoriginal storyline, and overall ""meh"" feeling towards Charlie Hunnam as a lead. Quite honestly, if I never got an advanced screening pass for it, I would've never seen it. BUT, I did get that pass, I did see it, and let me tell you...it wasn't bad at all.Director Guy Ritchie, of Sherlock Holmes fame, puts an entertaining bit of style to this flick, as it never feels like a drawn out Broadway production. Excellent pacing keeps you engaged the entire way through, and the sharp, humorous dialogue really gives you something to chew on. Hunnam gives a solid performance as a bruising, slick-talking Arthur, Jude Law carries the villain role well, and there are no glaring weak spots with the rest of the cast. (Although, admittedly, it's hard to see Aiden Gillen as anyone other than Littlefinger...)Action-wise, there's some solid stuff here. You've got your epic army battle, castle sieges, sword fights, and a special effect-loaded final battle that are all pretty serviceable. Maybe not the best action scenes you'll see this summer, but certainly not the worst. Listen, it's hard to recommend King Arthur when you could go see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in IMAX again (I just assume you've already seen it, because you're not stupid.)...but, if Guardians is sold out and you already drove out to the theater and need an alternative...Arthur can get you through the night.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is better than you thought it'd be. 3 out of 5 on the BDBOS.

236,champjohnson29,A Pleasant Surprise!,9,18 May 2017,"The first trailer had me very excited to see this film. The genre is right up my alley. But negative reviews made me think twice and I was just going to wait for it to go to redbox or watch it online (just being honest LOL). But then I started seeing positive reviews and I knew I had to form my opinion. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised and glad I went because I really enjoyed this film from beginning to end. IT's not without it's flaws but will get into that in a minute.Of course the tale of King Arthur, Excalibur, Camelot, etc. has been told so many times in Hollywood. However, Guy Ritchie's unique storytelling ability made it a fun ride to watch. I will admit that his signature exposition cut-aways got a bit repetitive and lost it's spice around the third time -- meaning, let's devise a plan, while showing the plan happening in order to save time, but explain to the audience what's going on without long monologues, etc -- it's a really cool way to tell a story but he used it a bit too much. Other than that, the rest of the movie was fairly enjoyable. It went a good pace and had the right amount of fantasy elements while showing Arthur go from a petty scammer to a King. I will say that the castings of Jude Law and Astrid Berges-Frisbey were the more questionable ones for me. They both were pretty monotone and did nothing for their characters. Charlie Hunnam is a decent actor as well. He didn't do anything Oscar worthy but I definitely believed him as Arthur. The moments when he actually used the sword in battle were my favorites. I think this is the first time in years where someone actually had a clear vision of how to showcase what exactly made Excalibur special. The final battle was a bit underwhelming with all the quick cuts and camera tricks. It was cool to watch from an aesthetic perspective but being just a regular person in the audience, I just wanted to watch them fight. Overall the movie is an 8 out of 10, but I gave it a 9 because it does NOT deserve a low score at all. It's a really good film that is actually re-watchable. Don't believe the negative viewers, it's a well made film!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

240,tomsters,steals to much but none from the actual legend.,3,6 July 2017,"this was not king Arthur. just because it got some dude with that name and a magical sword (that barely has any screen time) an author movie it does not make. those who liked it, great. obviously none know the story. that's what the majority paid to watch, a movie heavily based on the original legend. not an entirely different story stealing the name. that's like me making a story of your life but its got nothing to do with you except your name. make your movie but use your own original character names. this movie is all original, not a trace of actual legend. OH, WAIT! it also stole most of its story ideas from robin hood and (LOL) mostly the lion king. scar kills his brother to steal his kingdom and the king's kid comes back to take it back when he grows up. so there are thousands of paying movie goers claiming this is so great because it ain't the reprint of Excalibur and don't recognize what it did steal from. i hated this movie from beginning to end. id bet that if guy Richie was to remake star wars, it'd also look like this and the same ignorant morons would like that also. even if not named after the old legend, it was still a sloppy silly movie. looks great though but was all over the place. couldn't make up its mind what era it was taken place in, or its style. it tells us its ancient England but acts 18th century with a lot of modern. back street gangs vs big mob boss. or military coup? overthrow or turf war? modern language vs, nah, just modern gibberish. and yet another 'chosen one' movie where that special character rejects being special. more lack of originality. and then the guy publicly claims to have wanted to make a lord of the rings look a like movie. how is that original? and then uses a magical creature that could have ended the fighting at the beginning but waits to the end (like the giant eagles who could have flown the ring over the volcano at any time) but doesn't kill the bad king despite being right next to him while the giant snake kills every one else. why? well we cant have the two family members not fight each other, that would interfere with the originality of it once again. blah. oh ya, giant elephants. lets hope peter Jackson sues his ass off.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
241,julesfdelorme,"Sword, Sheath and Two Smoking Barrels",8,2 July 2017,"If you're a fan of Guy Ritchie movies, and I, for the most part, am, then you'll probably have no problems with medieval characters running around with cockney accents, clever quips and the story being told through fast cuts. I guess Ritchie figured that if it worked for Sherlock Holmes, why not try it out on King Arthur. And it does work. Mostly. It works as a straight ahead action movie. The special effects are good and there is very little slack. The characters and the film stay in constant motion. You will rarely have time to be bored. Or to think too deeply. It works as a Guy Ritchie movie, with all the signature effects and dialogue. The movie never takes itself too seriously and there are a few good laughs. The acting is good. Many Ritchie favorites return and Charlie Hunnam manages to keep the Al Pacino acting that he fell back on so often in Sons of Anarchy, where he talks softly and then shouts, to a bare minimum. He's pretty and he never gets in the way. You even get Aiden Gillen from Game of Thrones getting a chance to play a good guy. No problems there. And, as for the cockney accents, they're no more ridiculous in a movie like this than British accents in Romeo and Juliet or Hamlet. Not only are the characters in those plays Italian and Danish, the current British accent would not be at all how the people and the actors of Shakespeare's day would have spoken. And, since many of the characters in this particular film are working class, the cockney accents aren't nearly as silly as they may at first sound. There are no flaws to King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. You almost certainly will not leave the movie disappointed. It's fun and it's easy to watch. It's not Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. It's not Snatch or RocknRolla either. Sadly, we may never get that pre-Madonna Guy Ritchie back. You're not likely to be raving about King Arthur: Legend of the Sword to your friends years from now or re-enacting dialogue with them the way some many of us did after those earlier Guy Ritchie movies. There's nothing here that is going to redefine the genre. But, as is more the case with Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes movies, you are not likely to feel shorted on entertainment, or on fun. Maybe that's not enough for some people. But, in an an era where television series have begun to outclass movies on almost every possible level, that's a lot more than you're likely to get from most films. I honestly don't mean this as the condemnation of faint praise. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a good movie. It's a pretty damn good movie. Not everyone's going to think so. But if you like Guy Ritchie movies, if you liked his versions of Sherlock Holmes, if you like watching lots of sword fights, or if you just like looking at Charlie Hunnam, you'll probably like this movie. You may even like it a lot.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
242,twotrybe,I wanted to bail on this film on more than one occasion,1,20 May 2017,"Movie trailers are interesting. You as the viewer get to see a prospective film and be taken in by this 30 second or 60 second or even a two minutes and 30 second capsule of a two hour film. And when that time comes, you are sometimes rewarded fr your efforts and sometimes you are not. King Arthur had such promise with it's trailer and alas, it failed to live up to its promises. I went in expecting an action packed event but what I got was unnecessary expositions and a lot of unnecessary dialogue that bloated the film's running time. Let's assume we know the legend of King Arthur pulling the sword out of the stone. This version of King Arthur does that but with a twist, he passes out, not once, not twice but three times. This got tiresome the first time. When he grabs the sword out of the stone in front of the soldiers and the people, I was hoping for the first true action sequence to happen, sort of a medieval John Wick moment where he kicks ass sword style but that didn't happen. The film drags down and flat lines. At this stage, you become frustrated because now we get to hear from the evil king, played by Jude Law. In this role as the evil king, Jude Law throughout the entire film looks like he has a frozen fart face and he has to smell his stinky farts for eternity. But he talks incessantly just to hear himself drone on and on. And he isn't the only one. There are other men in this film that just talk too much for no other reason other than to bog down the flow of the film. I wanted to bail on this film on more than one occasion. It seems as if the writer wanted to inject some contemporary dynamics of what a well rounded 21st century man should feel like. He must be in touch with his feelings. Please, spare me. This is the medieval times. They were brutal and vicious in war. You get a tamped down version of the brutality. I've seen a lot of reviews on this film at this site and they give an inordinate number of positive reviews. I suspect that the film company who spent an estimated $175,000,000 on this film has hired film trolls to salt the reviews related to this movie. I can't believe the glowing responses this film has gotten because a lot of people didn't see this movie and this would be a statistically anomaly to have so many positive film reviews for a film that was marginal at best. I gave it a one star. Originally I was going to give it a three star review but after seeing these positive reviews, my suspicions came to the forefront. Like the old saying goes, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a film troll. Bottom line, they squandered a good retelling with way too much unnecessary exposition when it wasn't needed and the lack of action. Some good action comes at 1 hour and 21 minutes into this production. That's way too long. A film hero shouldn't be passing out three times before finally getting the hang of using a weapon. You'll lose the audience quicker than you think.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
243,TheDevilsNotetaker,King Arthur for the Fast & Furious Generation.,7,20 August 2017,"But still decent despite that.Fast cuts, CGI, LOTR type monsters, kicking soundtrack, hot medieval women, Jude Law in bad ass mode. If Michael Bay made a movie about Camelot this would be it. But like The Rock and The Island even the worst director ever can score a hit. And this is it.Best thing about this movie is bad guy Jude Law who steals every scene and you will remember only him if you ever feel like remembering this. lol.They were stretching the Medieval tech so much to show something new I was half expecting GPS and Gatling guns to show up.They try to do some fight scenes like in 300 but fails miserably.

244,metztex,A surprise worth watching,8,16 January 2020,"Bottom Line up front: Worth watching, no doubt. An original plot that may not follow the time tested lore of King Arthur but still teaches the lessons all should learn: You must face your fear, for it will make you stronger and better than you are now.I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The plot line is not totally original and the screenplay is a mix of old and new but it seems to work as many of the ""new"" sequences are not over the top. This helps the film. Character development is rather good here and the tired old brooding plot lines of the reluctant hero are cut short when it needed to be cut short. This helps push the main lesson, you can't run away from your fear.CGI is good for mid range budget film, can't complain there. Cinematography is also rather good and helps the film along. End scene was decent but felt it could have been better. Like the build up to it and the music score to the film was very well chosen. This helped a lot.If you like action and honor driven plot lines, you are likely to enjoy this one. If you are steeped in King Arthur lore, I would avoid this one.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
245,scandinavianmail,Mashup of King Arthur ... and Hamlet,4,16 May 2017,"Putting together the premise of Shakespeare's Hamlet and the legend of King Arthur with a thick layer of Lord of the Rings-y / World of Warcraft-y cgi has left Guy Ritchie seemingly paralysed as if he didn't know what to do with all that. Or any of that. Ritchie gets nothing out of his source material and only resorts to dutifully replicating his trademark slomos, punches, shakycams and fast cuts while the story itself crawls forward in such ridiculously worn-out ways that there is very little reason not to check out before the inevitable boss fight is finally over. There is even a passionless attempt to setup a franchise.

246,tony-clifton,One of the best fantasy films!,9,1 August 2017,"The problem with King Arthur is that it's about King Arthur. I think people just don't care. What Ritchie should have done is made a movie that was about someone else but inspired by the story of King Arthur, kind of like how Game of Thrones was inspired by the War of the Roses.If we forget about the fact the main character is King Arthur, then this movie is just fantastic. Guy Ritchie did an outstanding job with pacing, story and editing, and all the cast members were magnetic in their performances. There was no character that I felt was miscast, as Hunnam and Law were fabulous as protagonist and antagonist respectively.The music was just perfectly synchronized with the scenes and increased the drama and emotion of the movie, and the special effects also greatly enhanced the movie without distracting in any way.The end battle was superb and very enjoyable - I've been waiting for long time for a fantasy battle to be choreographed in a similar fantastical fashion, so I'm grateful that Ritchie has given us that.The only thing about this movie that I didn't like, was that nobody went to see it and therefore Ritchie won't be making any more King Arthur movies. This movie is outstanding and deserves to be a trilogy. It is the fantasy version of a super-hero movie in all the best ways. I certainly will be buying the blu-ray when it comes out.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

But half the time with this film, I wasn't even sure what I was watching. The editing made me completely dizzy, jumping around at such a frantic pace I was wondering if the characters were all on drugs and having hallucinations. They cut from one montage to another, which was confusing and headache inducing. Not sure why they would have gone with that choice. It was almost as if Guy Ritchie thought that if he kept the film moving at a breakneck speed no one would notice the film was so poorly written. I won't spoil the actual storyline of the film, because the editing of this was so distracting I don't actually remember much about the actual storyline. This film had a lot of things going for it, including talented actors, but in my opinion everyone involved with this film deserved better.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

249,Lefteris-Anagnostopoulos,King Arthur: Legend of the Re-imagining,7,31 May 2017,"Let's star the review with a few questions: 1)Is ""Legend of the Sword"" worth your money? Answer: Yes. 2)Is ""Legend of the Sword"" worth your time? Answer: Yes. 3)Should you watch ""Legend of the Sword""? Answer: It's up to you.Part 1PlotThis is not your standard Arthurian tale and that's for the best. Imagine if you had to pay to see the same movie over and over again. The Arthurian Tale is as old as time and re-imagining is necessary. Of course some thing never change like: Uther, Excalibur and Arthur himself. Part 2ActingCharlie Hunnam, as Arthur: He has the best performance in the movie. I adore the talk-brass and kick-ass/devil-may-care take on the character. It's more refreshing than having the ignorant farm-boy.Jude Law, as the villainous villain Vortigern who has a villainous sounding name, fitting for a villain: When the movie ends you will understand that Law had fun with his character. His not gonna be as memorable as -let's say- the Joker or Hannibal but he's not boring and he has clear motivations for his dark schemes. This guy is ruthless.Astrid Bergès-Frisbey, as the nameless, expressionless, fun-less, interesting... Mage: She is serviceable. Sometimes that's not bad but definitely not good. Her character is interesting for sure and if a possible sequel ever exists I'd love to see more of her backstory. But for this movie, she is just OK.Part 3Production and DirectingSometimes the image is rich with real locations and well-payed animations, other times, are cartoons in real sets. Guy Ritchie, is Guy Ritchie. You know when you watching his movies, you can't forget his energy and the frenetic editing. My only problem is that there are moments where everything is dark, very low lighting in the frame. It's very annoying especially during fight scenes. Conclusion I want to see more of this new Arthurian Tale, I'd like it to be a trilogy... not 6-parts as I read here in IMDb. If we're not gonna get a sequel at the very least, give us an extended cut of this movie. This movie should have been three hours long or two and a half, not just 2hrs 6 min.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
250,jamesl2061-683-328126,Could have and should have.,3,18 May 2017,"I wanted to like this film and in parts I do. The trailers promised so much.The cast, setting, action and effects were all as one would expect from another remake of this medieval tragedy. Yes, as anyone familiar with legend of Uthur Pendragon, the story of the sword in the stone, magic and mystery, Camelot and the knights of the round table knows, this was never a story with a happy ending.But I digress. The words of the wise on remakes and do-overs are clear, do it better or more interestingly or don't do it at all. Unfortunately, no one was listening.What ruined this film for me was not the story-line, the acting or the dark grittiness. It was the cinematography and the story-boarding.Every time I managed to re-immerse myself in the movie, I was yanked back with an incessant barrage of close-ups and pop-ups or a myriad of flashbacks and flash-forwards. I do not recall these techniques in Ritchie's other movies because I would have remembered, not even in Crank.The saddest thing about the overuse of what I would describe as optical mayhem is that none of it actually contributed much to the story. For me, the movie would have been better without that distracting rubbish. One can but surmise that the director either wanted the project to fail or he forgot to pay the film editor in which case he got his moneys worth.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
251,rs403404,King Hamlet: Legend of Anything But Arthur,2,13 May 2017,"The story of King Arthur is one that has been told and retold many times over with many different incarnations. From Le Morte D'Arthur to The Once and Future King to Mists of Avalon. It's a tale everyone knows and everyone likes to reinvent. This is not one of those incarnations. Sure, the main character is Arthur Pendragon (Charlie Hunnam), son of King Uther Pendragon (Eric Bana). Arthur proves his heritage by pulling the sword Excalibur from a stone. That about where the similarities end. A couple of characters share names with characters from the legend. A round table does pop up. But that's it.""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" borrows its story from many other classic sources while seemingly ignoring all it can from Arthurian lore. A bit where Arthur appears to grow up in fighting pits hearkens to Conan. A squid woman advises the main villain and looks like a clone of The Little Mermaid's Ursula (minus the personality). Arthur's rescue as an infant is a direct reference to the story of Moses. The most prominent story is that of Hamlet, with an Uncle (Jude Law) killing Arthur's father to take the crown. I guess they felt it would be too obvious to also have the uncle marry Uther's wife.I might've been able to forgive the massive liberties that make the story unrecognizable if the characters were likable in any way. They're not. Quite often, Arthur comes off as an obnoxious douche. Yes, Arthur who frequently displays humility in other works is at many times insufferably arrogant here.Guy Ritchie does manage the usual flourishes for which he's known. Sometimes they fail; as an example, an early montage that feels like Ritchie couldn't decide at which speed to play the video. Sometimes they almost work; for instance, an action sequence late in the movie that comes off like a slow-mo Zack Snyder style scene tuned up to maximum impact. The best scene is midway through act two in which the construct is reminiscent of a heist scene wherein Ritchie uses music, dialogue, and editing to build a moment that is fairly decent. Unfortunately, that scene is drowned out by the piles of crap surrounding it.The filmmakers have filled their world with truly annoying characters that are forced into an Arthurian shell, and, unfortunately, they are not the first to employ the aura of Camelot to sell tickets. Subsequently, Hollywood has vaults of movies which examine various aspects of this legend, almost all of which are better than this. This movie couldn't complete the quest.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
252,fmbr-1,"Some Good, Some Bad",6,13 September 2017,"This film is neither good nor bad. There are aspects of both and I can commend those involved for trying to do something different, but it wasn't done as well as it might have been.First and foremost, the special effects are 'BIG'. It starts with 200' tall elephants attacking Camelot which happens to be on a massive clifftop. The specials continue like this through the whole film.However, the plot is a little thin at times. For example, after the wizards with the 200' tall elephants are defeated by the good king Uther, his brother(? actually, I'm not sure if it is his brother or just someone else) sacrifices his wife to something like Ursula the Mermaid under the castle and organises a coup - turning into a giant 'fire knight' to go after King Uther, his wife and baby Arthur. After he defeats Uther, Arthur floats away (and Vortigern just lets him go) and the sword skewers Uther, turns him to stone and sinks into the water - again while Vortigern just watches.Merlin is mentioned but doesn't make an appearance and young Arthur is trained instead by the tough streets of Londinium (in a rather nice montage).Some of these jarring differences help make this a watchable film, but they often seem to trip over themselves, especially as many things are never explained.I gave it six which might seem a little harsh, but the end of the film seemed a little rushed (although the BIG special effects are all there).",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Why is it even allowed!?Then there's my take on this so called ""movie"":It is such utter, utter garbage and awful, awful crap as well as horrible acting by all ""actors"" and don't get me started on the music...It is also so incredibly far removed from the historical legends that it is criminal (!) to even remotely call it any name coming from the Arthurian stories. And I think that is because it does NOT have anything in it that resembles the myth and/or folklore stories retold in books like ""Le Morte D'Arthur"" or any other legends having their base in Arthurian myth. It's like the director and script writers didn't want anything to do with the actual historical legends.And then...No Guinevere. A real blunder.But also, NO Merlin, which is the worst, since that is like having NO Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings. Just imagine... So many things getting the wrong origin and telling. Like I said it's just criminal. I am so incredibly angry with Guy Ritchie.It's like he only wanted to miscredit the old legends of Arthur. Why?

254,TheDreadedChampion2019,Guy Ritchie's King Arthur,7,12 May 2017,"if you're looking for a faithful traditional adaption of King Arthur pulling the sword from the stone, then go f**k yourself, because this is not it. In this version of the story, Guy Ritchie basically makes Arthur a wisecracking street-fighter type who was raised in a brothel and now runs things on the streets with his lads. This Arthur gets the Snatch or Lock-Stock treatment, that Guy Ritchie flair. And I would say This is definitely the Most Guy Ritchiest Guy Ritchie film since probably Revolver. I love his style so It worked for me. Charlie H. Is likable on the lead and looks the part, and the rest of the cast is good overall. Unfortunately, The film likes a hot love interest and any romance. Also, there is a massive plot hole. It being that if he has Excalibur why doesn't he really use it until almost the end of the movie? Technically, the writers provide an explanation but it's pretty week in my opinion. Lastly, there is quite a bit of CG in this movie...and some of it is not terribly great...Overall it's a fun, stylish, different kind of medieval action flick, that's entertaining albeit not terribly memorable. KING ARTHUR: LEGEND OF THE SWORD mixes elements from Bravehart, Batman Begins and then contaminates them with Guy's signature style. I don't know how to write reviews. Uh.....",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Apart from the names nothing is accurate, Morgana is not the baddie but the evil uncle who makes a deal with evil, turns into the most convoluted King Arthur with Excalibur.

Some people needs to get off their high horses and just enjoy this movie for what it is; a jolly good time! Don't expect a masterpiece, but expect to be entertained!It is a new take on Arthur and his knights, and why not! Why would we want to see the story, as it has been told for yonders, yet again? Giant elephants and snakes - I thought that was pretty cool additions to the Arthurian legend. So boohoo, they cut out Sir Lancelot from this take on the tale, and Merlin is represented only by a nameless lady... Get over it.The script is OK and holds up without too many plot holes. The CGI is not mind blowing; but I've seen much worse (like in Wonder Woman for example)... I love the fast pace of this film, and of course the soundtrack is banging as one would expect from a Guy Ritchie film. There's a few laughs along the ride too. Give this movie a chance.

259,Man-Behind-The-Pen,This movie has nothing to do with the Legend of king Arthur,1,19 September 2017,"So, I have seen the movie and the only thing good about it was the trailer. The acting was wooden. The choice for the lead role of King Arthur was woefully miscast. The man knows only how to yell for ""dramatic effect"" and that was the least of his problems. The direction of the movie was non-existent. The script had 2 – 3 moments and that was about it. What the hell was that with ""Hockey face masks"". The rest of the costumography was atrocious, especially when it comes to the time period when the movie was supposed to be set. Was anyone else reminded of the ""All Seeing Eye"" from Lord of the rings?The whole movie was remarkably underwhelming and the only thing in common with the actual ""King Arthur Legend"" was the title of the movie. I have read amazing 4 books, which was written by a historian about the ""King Arthur Legend"" and the original material has more than enough substance. Why would you want to re-invent the whole legend? If Guy Richie wanted to make a ""deep artistic movie"" he came out like a pretentious ignoramus. I loved his movies but this one was a complete 0. I give it 0 stars. Nothing can beat the original ""Excalibur"" from 1980's. Remake would be difficult to make for it to achieve the darkness and amazing scenery, battles, armour, weapons. It is possible IF Hollywood will not be allowed to get near it. Oh and Excalibur, looked like a cheap kitsch you sell to stupid tourists.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

261,AJx91,Can't Believe We Won't Get A Sequel,9,29 April 2021,"Tldr; You wouldn't waste your time, it is worth a 2 hour watch because it provides a different movie experience. Most of the critics don't know what they are talking about. But since it bombed in the box office; don't expect a sequel from this.I would like to start off and say; I literally can't believe the hate critics and movie-goers initially gave this movie. It reminds me when everyone at first said that Sucker Punch was trash. However years later a lot of people changed their mind and I hope this happens with King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.I can only fault this movie for two things: bad marketing and not giving us nudity/sex-scenes. I mean this is a adult film with all sorts of gore, violence, and our hero literally grows up in a BROTHEL? The only reason why it failed the box office and probably have the bad reviews; is because the wrong people were marketed; therefore it is not being watched by the right kind of people.You like over the top action; with a blend of medieval and fantasy; don't care if a title is woke? If that is a yes, then great! Forget about the old cartoon tales of King Arthur and come join a new experience; from Prince to Raggs to Robinhood to King.Everything else about this movie is perfect from the scenery, musical score, metaphorical depth, acting, and choreography.One thing I constantly saw critics making fun of King Arthur was the editing, but the editing was the most fun and creative part about the film. Why just tell the tale in any boring way? I like that KALotS spiced it up.The last thing I will say is that-these critics sometimes, ""make sense of the devil.""

262,aranormer,Confusing,5,1 March 2018,"I gave this five stars. That good of an action film this is, and I like many of the actors who took part in this. Had the director, writers and production team dropped the whole ""Arthurian legend"" and given this movie different name this would have been treated like any other sword&sorcery adventure. Nothing to remember after watching it, but quite entertaining while watching it.Like many others have already said, the basic story line and the characters do not match with the original Arthurian legend. You could take any of the characters on screen and give him/her any possible name that comes to mind and the story wouldn't suffer. You could slap on any kind of scene from any kind of other movie smack dab in the middle of this one, and nobody would really notice it.Characters are supposed to represent the best and brightest of the Arthurian legends, but we get cut-outs from previous roles of their respective authors. That wasn't Arthur carrying the Excalibur, it was Jax dragging some improvised club/whatever through the mud. Any of the knights were completely unrecognisable. Merlin? Wasn't there. A girl who looked like she escaped from Supernatural's set while wearing demon make-up replaced him. Jude Law as brooding and sinister king was... Well, he was evil. And brooding.This is a confusing bag of puzzle pieces. No matter how hard you try, you can't put them together to form a coherent and pleasant image. There's pieces missing, and more than half of what's there is taken from other puzzles.Why I gave this five stars? I'm starting to wonder it myself. Pacing of the movie was horrible. Acting? Mediocre. Casting? Weird. CGI? Lots of it. I can see this becoming a guilty pleasure for me, unless Netflix takes it down some day.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Yes, it has almost nothing to do with the traditional legend of King Arthur, other than some character names as well as the name of the sword. Viewed through the lens of English history, the plot would seem ridiculous. So what? Just set that aside, and enjoy it for what it is – a rollicking good fantasy adventure! I have always liked Charlie Hunnam, and he does not disappoint here as the sword-wielding hero. Some of the CGI creature effects are simply stunning. OK, so the story isn't Lord of the Rings – nothing else is or will be. But it's fast- paced and exciting, and that is the point of entertainment.

Actually, after I watched Sherlock Holmes series I have been waiting for this film to be realistic adaptation of King Arthur but it is so fantastic briefly my rate is 4/10.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
267,9thgraders,The best version of this legend,7,8 June 2017,"I was thinking this movie is like the other movies but it isn't.The new version of the legend of the King Arthur sent me in an awesome magic world. The plot wasn't original: the sword is imprisoned in a rock, Arthur takes it off and becomes the heir of the throne but the nasty king, who killed Arthur's parents, wants to keep the throne.But what is great in this movie is that Arthur doesn't want to be the king. There are no heroes who are very nice and helpful and fight the villains for peace and love and no cheesy moral. This movie is more realistic! I'm not an expert but I think the cast is excellent. Jude Law portrays perfectly the terrible king and Charlie Hunnam plays a very relaxed Arthur who is also of course very strong. Astrid Bergès-Fisbery plays «The Mage»; a wonderful character. It adds gentleness and beautiful magics spells with animals to the movie. Furthermore, she is a woman and, in my opinion, the movie lacks women.The way the movie is filmed is very interesting. The director, Guy Ritchie, uses slow motion in fights which are just incredible and a lot of other tricks that made this movie modern and also funny. Besides, the music is just amazing. It sounds like Irish music but more modern and thrilling. You can't get bored with it! Add beautiful landscapes, Middle Ages cities and a dark castle and you can imagine what a super movie it is.So, if you are looking for a good fantasy-adventure movie with much action and original characters just to have fun: watch this movie! JeCa",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
268,TheAlmightyFinger,Maybe misguided...but entertaining,6,25 May 2019,"This film by Guy Ritchie has a lot to commend it, but almost as much to dismiss it. I think the biggest mistake is that legend has been turned into myth. There is a significant difference between the two, in my opinion.Had the plot remained within the realms of legend, with Guy Ritchie's treatment, it would have been a cult film. But, unfortunately the film descends into total fantasy, with a glut of supernatural creatures and explosive magic. So you are stuck with the one genre, that is probably the most predictable one, with the least suspense. I am not panning this film: it is entertaining. I just feel that an opportunity has been missed.Pros: The soundtrack is thrilling and amazing, mixing medieval with contemporary. All the characters, even smaller roles, are believable and likable (or dislikable) as is required. The visuals and special fx are mostly very good. The editing, although maybe not really appropriate for a sword-and-sandal film, has Guy Ritchie's stamp all over it (i.e. very stylized, but good).Cons: Well, the legend of King Arthur is open to interpretation, of course. General consensus has the king living in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. Vikings were first recorded in Britain in 793, about 300 years later. So including them in this narrative, is just one example where the director was purposefully disingenuous. Was it to simply to add some colour to the story? Why? King Arthur's legend has enough drama without including vikings. The period was the brutal dark ages, do you really have to invent anything else? There are, of course, many anachronistic weapons, armour, words, ethnicities, and social structures that firmly (and unnecessarily) removes a legend into the realms of total fantasy, which is unfortunate.Verdict: Entertaining to watch once, if you do not expect any real substance.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

271,realmuthaf,Get Knighted,9,10 August 2017,"Seriously, again? Again, Guy Ritchie makes an awesome movie with potential for sequels and an outstanding kick-ass soundtrack from Daniel Pemberton, and again it fails to get good critic reviews and solid box office performance?If there are two most unfair box office performance patterns these days, those are Disney's frame-by-frame ""live-action"" (i.e. CGI) worthless remakes of their classic cartoons getting billions of dollars and Guy Ritchie's two last movies (this and the equally amazing U.N.C.L.E.) severely underperforming financially. Let's see the outcome when those two trends collide with Ritchie making an Aladdin movie.In the meantime, don't listen to the so-called ""critics"" and watch The Legend of the Sword. It's a great, hugely entertaining action movie with solid performances from the main (Hunnam, Law) and the side characters alike. The pacing is impeccable, with the action not letting you go throughout the film. It's got some great, Ritchie trademark humor and dynamic editing, too. The CGI can look cheap, and that's probably my only complaint aside from a few minor ones. Oh, and did I mention the kick-ass soundtrack? I did, but again, it's so good I stayed through the credits just to listen to it, and immediately got myself the album after watching the movie.Warner Bros., please, take some of that comic book money and let Ritchie make Arthur 2 or U.N.C.L.E. 2, the world will be a better place.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

273,lmathc,An Underrated Gem,9,19 April 2019,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a fantastic film with many key selling points that vastly outshine its downfalls. The soundtrack and ambience set a dark and gritty tone but don't go over the top. The action is well-executed and the effects are staggering. The acting is very good and is led by Jude Law, who somehow manages to invoke empathy from the audience while being a despicable yet strikingly believable villain. Even Charlie Hunnam, whose performance in Pacific Rim left much to be desired, came across as a very human and likeable iteration of the immortal King Arthur character. Other supporting actors and actresses add depth without taking away from the impact that the two stars have on the movie. Yes, it can get a tad convoluted at times and some slo-mo is a little gratuitous, but this movie manages to stake a claim of its own in the fantasy-action genre, nestling itself just a notch or two below that of the Lord of the Rings.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
274,martin-807-452270,woeful withered rat's cock of a film,2,22 May 2017,"King Arthur: legend of the sword *****There be spoilers in these words, mate***** So to keep with the food theme of the previous review Blokey Arthur legend of the sword is like popping down a good old East End Chippy for a guilty portion of greasy chips. You know the sort of place: no where to sit, they have pickled eggs in a jar on the counter, the man serving you picks his nose with a fat tattooed finger and someone has been sick outside on the pavement. Yeah, pukka. Salt of the earth. And then you walk off with your cone of hot chips, only they are not hot, they are cold. More like small brown paper bags filled with pus. But you carry on because, well, you are hungry and they did cost £15. But then you find a pubic hair. But you carry on, because it could have just blown in or could even be one of your own! But you carry on and a few 'chips' later you find a set of false teeth, and you know these aren't yours because, well, you don't have false teeth and you don't know anyone who does, what with the advent of the NHS and all that. So you press on determined to get to the bottom of your cone of pus-chips and just as you are about to get to the last chip you discover that it isn't actually a chip but a withered rat's cock. That's what King Arthur: legend of the sword is: a withered rat's cock of a film. Kind Arthur the legend has been around for over 1000 years there are many stories and yarns about which to weave your narrative. But this film does not do that, it moves everyone to Londium (FFS!) and make young Arthur an Arthur Dodger clone and lives in a brothel and is handy with his fists and does thieving and stuff, yawn, Oh I'm so sorry, are you still here? Guy Ritchie made Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels which is about a bunch of east end gangsters stealing stuff. It is an excellent films. He then made Snatch which is about a bunch of east end gangsters stealing stuff. and he also made Sherlock Holmes 1 and 2 (I can't be arsed to talk about Rocknroller and Swept Away) which are about a bunch of east end gangsters stealing stuff. They worked because in Victorian London there WAS an East End and people DID speak like that and steal stuff. But not in 1000AD (FFS part2) where people would be speaking some sort of bastard Latin - anglo saxon norse heathen mix and there wasn't any East End, what with London only having about 50,000 people in it following 300 years known as the dark ages, where not much happened, except for death and disease and stuff. This film is all about a bunch of east end gangsters stealing stuff but it just doesn't work, as the language is incongruous the wardrobe ridiculous (I kept on looking for a singer sewing machine in the wide shots) and the acting often tragic (but not in a good way!). Ritchie's thrilling directorial style which was so good in 1997 does not translate to mystical worlds where the genre expectation makes you feel uncomfortable when the characters use 21st century speak. The camera work just felt 'wrong' and the sets all looked theatrical and not for one second did I not think I was watching a movie. Plot is poor and difficult to follow, so many scenes are throwaway and could be cut, and where is Merlin? or Sir Lancelot or any of the other Arthurian heroes and as for the poor females in the film, I'm not sure why they bother to turn up. Arthur of Legend is full of love stories and betrayals for lust and love and there is none of that in this film.

The trailer for this movie were so awful but the movie is pretty enjoyable.... From the 1st act you will know its a Guy Ritchie movie in his style... It has a lots of magic... The script is little dull sometime but it is awesome at the same time for the rest of the movie... Charlie Hunnam is very good as king Arthur...Jude Law is fantastic in that character.... Djimon Hounsou is also very good... Some other characters were not developed somewhat... In the second act it goes a little slow.... The dialogues are pretty good in this movie...Third act of this movie when action goes down they showed us that there is so much at stake but you will not feel that watching it, though you enjoy the action at the same time... Some of the magical slow motion action scene are little jarring and hard to keep up with whats happening.... The very last act of the movie goes to a little cheesy and random play as every movie does... that was dull...

281,Dccra1,Wrote around the CGI while peppering it with a few Arthurian names...,1,1 July 2017,"I will start my review by saying those who say, ""the only people who hated this film, are those who expected it to be true to the original tale,"" are partially correct. Seeing that we are NOT devoted Guy Ritchie fan boys or paid reviewers, we also tend to like well- written movies with character development and a little thing called a PLOT. We're kind of odd that way.Yes. Five minutes in, which consisted of a convoluted mix of Lord of the Rings' Oliphants and Uther slaying his (what should have been) unborn grandson (or nephew) Mordred, I knew this was going to be a new and unimproved story some schmo wrote around the CGI while peppering it with a few Arthurian names. Even then, knowing it was not really an authentic King Arthur film, I was willing to see if there were any redeeming factors that would pleasantly surprise me... Good acting? Nope. Charlie Hunnam was lifeless. Jude Law was... for lack of a better word... awful. David Beckham?!?!? What in the hell was he doing there? I'm also not sure why many of the lesser characters talked like modern day British street thugs with deep cockney accents. That made me cringe... and not in a good way... if there is a good way.Direction? I guess that depends. If you like your King Arthur/fantasy movies more on the Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels side... with back and forth nonsensical fast-cutting clips and a dopey rewind shtick, then you might call it genius. If not. You may find this sloppy form of repetitive ""artistic"" tripe, which was unsuccessfully used as an attempt to gloss over a B-A-D bad script, extremely annoying. In the end, if you have a low attention span, love the quicksand Guy Ritchie walks on, or work for Warner Bros, you will love this box office bomb. If none of the above, I suggest not wasting your time and re-watching John Boorman's Excalibur again.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
282,KalleFaan,Not even near the original myth.,3,30 July 2017,"I actually had to get myself drunk to get through this drivel. It's a Lord of the Rings wannabe with Guy Ritchie directing it as one of his usually very good gangster flicks. The myth of King Arthur, Excalibur, Merlin and all the other things are good for one reason. It is what it is. Change that and you're on thin ice. The only thing this movie gets right is a few of the names. It's not a new take on the myth, it's completely different in every way.If you want to know the ""true"" myth as it has been for hundreds of years you should watch ""Excalibur"" from 1981 instead.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The beauty of movies is seeing a well known myth/legend, that has been made over a over again, and adapting a different slant to a story with imaginative execution. 10 out of 10 Guy, you should be proud. You've yet again, made another entertaining and dramatically different movie with your signature all over it....Love it. The acting is tremendous, with a small part from Beckham, looking very much in character, and adding humour in just the right places. If you want to see King Arthur as you have usually seen portrayed, then this is not for you, BUT if you want realism, mixed with mythical magic, action with a twist of Guy, then you WON'T be disappointed. It is such a shame to read the low reviews as I feel they just don't get the idea of movie making. They are supposed to be entertaining, and I feel that many have not seen the style of Guy Richie.

285,ddangtruong23,A Good Story Ruined By Terrible Directing,5,1 August 2017,"Guy Ritchie once again proved that he no longer has any interest in making good movies, only mediocre ones that he can use to show off his style.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, like Guy Ritchie's previous movies Sherlock Holmes 2 and The Man From U.N.C.L.E., doesn't feel like a complete movie. Instead, Ritchie's choppy and fast-paced style of editing created something that feels like a teaser, an impressive one visual-wise, but still just a teaser for a better movie. It continuously, throughout its entire run time, teases at a legendary story set in an elaborate world full of magical creatures, only to skips forward the minute something interesting appears on screen. The clearest evident of this problem is when Arthur goes to a place called The Dark Island to train himself on how to wield his power (sounds familiar, Star Wars fan?). This happens half way through the movie and after all the buildup, you wouldn't be faulted for hoping to finally see something truly epic. Unfortunately, this entire sequence takes less than 10 minutes and the movie spends all that precious time jumping back and forth between the action on the island and two characters talking about how dangerous that island is. What is the point, I must ask. If you want us to know the island can prove a big challenge to Arthur, then just show it to us. Show us all the action and all the danger uninterrupted and we'll see for ourselves. Cutting it short and interjecting it with mindless drivel will only make the whole thing meaningless.And that was only one example. The movie commits this fault time and time again. It loses focus too quickly and never truly invests in its own content until the final third. It's almost as if Ritchie simply had no confidence in the script or the actors and saw the needs to 'enhance' their performances with his editing magic (again, sounds familiar, Star Wars fan?).It's really a shame because beneath that atrocious editing, you can almost see a good story waiting to be told and good performances waiting to be witnessed. But I guess we'll never truly know and that thought alone makes the whole thing even more frustrating.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
286,good-decision,The Good and the Bad,6,17 May 2017,"All in all this is a very entertaining movie and from this standpoint you won't be regretting spending the money. However, if you are going to watch a masterpiece, or something on par with the best in the genre, you'll be disappointed. First, the good things about this movie: it has SOME very interesting art work at the first few minutes and the last. Jude Law was brilliant given the bad material he was given to work with. The music is an excellent choice for this movie. Costumes and special effects were on the whole interesting. Some moments in the movie were epic and very well made and would have made a whole load of difference if more attention and few more details were taken care of, but the movie was busy being a fight fest to bother. The child actor (forgot his name) was great. There are about ten minutes if that in the movie that are nothing short of spectacular. That's about it really. Now the bad: The dialog is from hell. I cringed hearing Eric Banna deliver almost identical lines from his famous and better written Troy. In fact, too many parts of the movie feel like a deja vue and not in a good way. Jude Law aside, acting was below bar. Fight scenes too lengthy, messy and boring. What bothers me the most about this movie that it could have been very easily a masterpiece with just a bit more care and attention and application of the old adage less is more (especially with the empty bravado and the questionable fighting not to mention retarded dialog). Finally, I extend by special thanks to David Beckham for NOT acting. Stick with footie we beg you.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

He is hit and miss. However he is usually worth having a look because if nothing he does have a uniqueness which is to be respected. Unfortunately this is a big miss. It has a big budget and looks pretty but when will Hollywood learn that these two things will never be able to make a good film on their own, they are only tools with which to make good films the best they can be. As the saying goes, you can't polish a turd. And this most surely is a turd of a screenplay. It's just a string of conversations showing flashbacks. Which is fine, many films are turds. But it's actually really disappointing because the Arthurian legend is one of the main medieval stories that we English (and welsh) can claim, and i am still waiting desperately for someone to do a good filmic adaptation of the athurian legend, true to source and with its heart in the right place. Maybe the only reason to watch would be for a chuckle at David Beckham hilarious attempt at actor (he has a small cameo speaking part), but you can probably find that on youtube.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

I knew what I was getting into when Jax Teller turned up in the first trailer with enough product in his hair to make Fearless Leader from ""The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle"" jealous. I knew the drill right then and there when he pulled out the Sword with the clear intention to once and for all rid the world of Jude Law (kudos!). He smirked, he fought, he lost at first but then he won, just like the countless blond likes of Craig, Ledger and Tatum always do. There's nothing to wreck your brain over, no somber story twists and subsequent head-scratching. Although, all the regular platitudes, which writers invariably pass for ""genre attributes"" in a PG-13 swordplay fantasy were there: bloodless pricking, no sexual innuendo whatsoever and definitely no ""F"" word. And even though Peter Dinklage would have been bored out of his disproportionately huge mind, somehow I was OK with it.

293,alex-klein2424,All Hail the King,9,13 June 2017,"There comes a time in any man's life where he decides to get excited about a movie trailer instead of listening to the haters. While that is a very specific time in any man's life, it was a time that occurred to me when I made the conscious decision to visit Camelot at the movie theater, and in 3D no less. I say all of that because when I first saw the trailers I though to myself ""this looks like the next sad attempt at Hollywood trying to milk the populous of more money based off some franchise"". I scoffed a few times in my seatI think this might have been during multiple movies as I see a lot of movies and I get trailer fever, which here is not the type of fever like Bieber Fever but more of the type of fever like Cabin Fever or perhaps a type of Fever that was present during the Black Plague. Trailers to me are one of two things. They are tasteful glimpses into what a new movie will be or they are blatant ploys to show the best parts of a movie to get people to go see it. Trailers are like mini movies. A great trailer, like that of Dunkirk or Star Wars, is the type of trailer we deserve. One where not a lot is revealed, but just enough to tease you and make you want to spend so much money going to see the movie. A trailer like that of super hero movies (yes I'll admit that) or basically any trailer where you go ""I know exactly how this movie will play out"" are the types of trailers that should be banned from theaters. The reason this steams me like a bag of broccoli is because I see so many movies so I see the same trailers over and over and the good ones can get me excited multiple times, the bad ones make me sick to my stomach and make we want to throw up a bag of steamed broccoli.The first trailer of this movie was not great. I then saw the second trailer and there was some new music and scenes and that had me very interested. The kind of interested that would make me want to see this movie in theaters with friends or family or alone. I made up my mind that I would and as soon as I did I saw reports that shocked me. I saw terrible reviews about this film ""The Director Stinks! This movie is stinky! Lots of stink!"". I became nervous. Then I saw that it bombed at the box office. Like SCUD missile bombed. It was at that point that I turned my fear into excitement. I decided to see this movie regardless of all of that and truly judge its merit on my viewing and not anyone else. I saw it in 3D which may have helped, but I have to tell you all, this movie was amazing. I enjoyed it so much more than I thought and just as much as I hoped. The effects were really cool and Guy Ritchie, the director, has some fantastic touches that he uses like some really funny flash back sequences and some amazing action scenes. He really did a good job trying to make this a story of his own and not just a retelling of King Arthur. Charlie Hunnam is great as Arthur and the rest of the cast is also well placed. I was enthralled the entire time so I don't know what is going on in Hollywood currently.In a world where Smurfs just got a reboot and Spider-Man is on his third actor (the best actor, the movie is going to be so good and I literally cannot wait), why not weed through all the remakes and reboots and try out this movie for size and see if you like. If you don't like it then don't blame me because I just write these reviews, you may have different tastes than I do. I can't be held responsible for your own decisions to see this movie but if you do enjoy it, just know who to thank for the great review. Take a friend, take a relative, take a date. Dress up in armor, but maybe not because you might get in trouble. Either way, go see this movie.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

295,guedesnino,"The best of the proposal presented by Guy Ritchie, is in total unpretentiousness and unconcern",7,3 July 2017,"The best of the proposal presented by Guy Ritchie, is in total unpretentiousness and unconcern with the lovers or idolaters of the classic tales connected to the medieval universe of King Arthur, it is evident his desire to present a story that talks to the present times, mainly in creating a Blockbuster that meets the wishes of a young audience, arousing in this same audience, the interest in following a new film franchise. Guy ambitiously interweaves the interests of a major studio production, a visual quality and narrative characteristics characteristic of the director. In summary, a film with artistic and commercial pretensions, and that manages to fail in both aspects, which perhaps has generated so many negative critics, but that make ""King Arthur"" a curious case to be observed and that already it is worth giving that conferred in the movie. Highlight the ""hip- hop montage"" that portrays the advance of childhood to the adulthood of King Arthur, a work exquisite and characteristic of Guy Ritchie's accelerated montage.Guy Ritchie is an English filmmaker who caught the attention of many in 1998 with the release of his second film ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". It is evident in this work, marks that have become singular to the style of Guy, and that consequently they are present in ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"", like an edition of abrupt images, with cuts dry, fast the frantic use of the images And which are expressed by the use of a very punctual camera whose plans are governed in large part by the editing and counting on a movement of camera and plans as the characters advance, that is, a perspective of following, the follow of a point To the other. A bold language, very similar to that of video clips and videogames, which at the same time generates a contradictory duality in ""King Arthur"", because, at the same time, it is interesting and different to have a medieval history, which has already been told and retold so many times and In such close ways, here, in Guy's film, it is more remodeled.To reshape this history, the director renounces any literary pricelessness or of an untouchable character in the face of a secular history, on the contrary, he modernizes it and expresses it in several scopes, in the costume, for example, uses the resource of timeless fashion, From modernization to garments, creating lightness and mobility to aid in the action scenes, our King Arthur is now a man who exhibits the features of his body wearing shirts that show off his pectoral heals. The soundtrack is a separate show, signed by Daniel Pemberton and featuring songs ranging from Led Zeppelin's ""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"", blending classic musical styles of Nordic culture, troubadours, polyphonic music with Organon's and with own compositions and an incidental track full of serious sounds, references to heavy metal that resembles something of ""Mad Max"" and mainly by the insertion of a sound, that in the film mixes to the roar of elephants and its effect of horns and To ""BRAAAM"", created by Mike Zarin for the movie ""Inception"" and which has become a fever and almost obligatory resource for action films, suspense and epic traits.Computer graphics is another interesting aspect in ""King"", often assuming the direction of the film, because in the great scenes of fight or combat, important and expected scenes with expectations of the fans of this genre, since they are characteristic marks of epic films And action, as well, they are given to computer graphics, which is largely done in a masterly way, but which questions Guy's limits and ability as a director, even in Guy's most striking feature of technical virtuosity, are Now assumed by the graphic resource and exploited in too much time and narrative appeal that only generate confusion, tiredness and again the superficiality strikingly employed to the film, result even in the performances governed by stereotyped constructions. Jude Law as Vortigern, bordering on the infantile of a villain who can not be justified, his ambition, his motivations and vilanias are weaker, compared to a villain of drawing, for all that Vortigern does is about an action punctuated only by doing, Something that so little Charlie Hunnam achieves with his King Arthur, the charisma of the actor is notorious and his effort is visible, but useless before the superficiality of a character and a story that turns out to be more fantasy.""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" in trying to be modern gets lost in its own fragmented virtue, generating a fantasy film without trace of wanting to be history, even though it is based on one (for a very rich sign), and ends up generating a product without Focus, but that shoots to all sides and doubting the explicit desire of its end, to stimulate the public to follow the next stories that will come from this franchise, since the inability to stick to the original idea, to tell the legend of the sword Of King Arthur, who ends up being portrayed soon, giving space to a script that turns on an enclosed mission that does not need and does not want to tell any more.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Think SAMURAI EDITOR. Another reviewer stated that there's some good action sequences at 90 minutes into the movie. We didn't have that kind of patience.

297,zumo-16908,Like a long trailer for a video game I do not want to play,1,8 May 2017,"This film is so bad that I am not sure where to start and where to end. This will be my new benchmark film for 1-star ratings.There is an excessive amount of epic slow motion action scenes with epic cinematic horn sounds and CGI throughout the whole film. The cinema technician forgot to switch the lights off when the film started, so for like half an hour I, and many others, were in doubt if this was the actual film or just a very long trailer. Eventually the lights went out, but the trailer'esque epicness continued throughout the whole film, to the point where it first became boring and later straight out annoying. Imagine watching trough more than two hours of video game trailers in one go.The humour is cringingly bad and awkwardly out of place. At one moment someone is making smart-a** dad-puns, and merely seconds later someone is having a mind-melting wizard-overlord moment with fire and ice exploding all over the screen, including mysterious whispering voices in the background. As cliché demands it, the main characters dialogue is of course an endlessly flowing stream of these dreadful wits, while he at the same time swings his mighty sword in magic and testosterone fueled ecstasy.Half of the plot is told trough flash-backs/forwards, where the characters talk about something, and after they stop talking then the events have presumably taken place. If they had cut down on the slow motion CGI scenes then there could easily have been time to tell these parts of the plot in full. But I suppose the people behind this low-point in cinematography thought that the target audience would be pleased to enjoy two hours of trailer action without having to worry about abstract concepts like ""plot"" and ""story"". I have absolutely no idea who such a target audience would be.Applying even the most basic logic thinking while watching this film will only lead to disappointment. At one point in the film, the ""good guys"" discuss if they can kill someone with a bow shot or if the distance is too great. During the next battle they summon a gigantic serpent that annihilates a whole army. Guess they should have thought about that earlier... I find it remarkable how anyone could make an interpretation of the famous story of King Arthur last more than two hours, while still keeping it so thin that it could slide underneath the great pyramid of Giza.

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword was a great and funny action adventure movie. It should not be overlooked.I am personally a big fan of King Arthur/Merlin/Knights of the Realm films and TV adaptations of the legends. Some are horrible. Some are decent. Some are spectacular. This one was heartfelt, engaging, and funny from beginning to end. Charlie Hunnam has proved several times that he is a leading man (Sons of Anarchy, Nicholas Nickelby, Crimson Peak). He played King Arthur with as much bravado and vulnerability as he did Jax - but it was not a repeat performance. it was a fresh take on the King Arthur standard: humble, sometimes melancholy, but always hopeful gentleman. Thank you Guy Ritchie, writers, and Hunnam for re- imagining this hero.Yes, there are parts that are wholly sensational, but in a good Lord of the Rings way, not a bad Legend of Hercules way. And no, it does not pass the Blechdel Test, but not many movies do every season. This one is good. It's just too bad it was overshadowed by the exhausting craze for comic book extravaganza.

302,stevenduhig,Good but not great entertainment.,7,17 May 2017,"Clearly the Director Guy Ritchie wanted to create something very different in this rendition. It is hard to escape the influences of Lord of The Rings though. The influence of the Merlin TV series is acknowledged briefly at the start with a short cameo from Katie McGrath (Morgana), just before launching into a very high speed story line taking Arthur from a child to adulthood, and bringing him to the realization that he was the true King. David Beckham's cameo was fun I suspect the money might have been better spent elsewhere? As a result of this vari-speed cinematic approach it is certainly ""very modern"" and very different. Although the movie kept our full attention, our small USA audience did not seem too impressed with the manipulation. I have to question whether, especially given that there are supposed to be five more of these movies, that this approach was necessary? There were a lot of heavy regional British accents, and at least one great (over?) extended scene of British rapid fire humor which as a Brit I loved, but the American audience seemed, to me, to be totally thrown by the language and the pantomime-style sequence. Thankfully I heard only one F-Bomb and saw and heard very little objectionable material in the movie which was a good thing. The special effects were absolutely outstanding. I particularly loved the treatment of the sword thrown into the lake. I loved Arthur's Muse ""Nimue"" played by Astrid Bergès-Frisbey and all of the other supporting characters, but I am afraid I kept wanting to see a stronger performance from Charlie Hunnam in the lead. I even kept wanting to cast Kenneth Brannagh in that role!

304,matthewmercy,King Arthur? It should be called 'Prince Albert' because it sucks you-know-what...,2,2 June 2017,"Obnoxiously misconceived and carelessly delivered, Guy Richie's King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) is a terrible film; badly written, largely uninspiringly acted, tonally inconsistent, and clearly hacked to pieces in the editing room in an effort to bring the (still too long) running time down, it is a total dumpster fire.So much about the movie is wrong it is hard to know where to start, but I'll have a go; firstly, the charmless Charlie Hunnam's cocky, granite-abs 'Arfur' is about as appealing as fishing cat turds out of your guttering. Whilst his 'Londinium' accent has improved slightly since he gave us a train-wreck impersonation of a Cockney geezer in the atrocious Green Street (2005), here his swaggering, hipster-bearded smart arse totally fails as an attractive focal point for the film. Jude Law is curiously muted as the cookie-cutter bad guy, his archetypal character right up there with Christopher Eccleston's Malekith and Oscar Issac's Apocalypse in the useless blockbuster villain stakes, whilst Djimon Hounsou and Aiden Gillen (wheeling out that curious Game of Thrones accent again) just look bored. The females are similarly listless, as Peaky Blinders' wet-eyed Annabelle Wallis obviously suffers from her role being cut to pieces, whilst Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey gives a performance typical of a French actress-model; essentially, she just pouts her way through the entire film. Only the characteristically excellent Neil Maskell manages to make an impact, but purely in his later scenes; early in the film he's just another of the line-up of Hunnam's tediously motor-mouthed mates.The movie is astonishingly choppy and incoherent. Some characters' backstories are truncated to the point where we know nothing about them, whilst others (such as Game of Thrones' Michael McElhatton and Cucumber's Freddie Fox) are introduced and then vanish well before the end without any explanation. Key scenes are rushed and thus lose any impact; for instance the central 'sword in the stone' set-piece crashes and burns due to inexplicable character actions (I have no idea what Hunnam's 'sod this' and haste to get to the front of the queue was supposed to be about), and a supremely useless gimmick appearance by David Beckham, which might have looked 'Britannia Cool' back in 1999 but in 2017 just seems stupid. There is no element of suspense or excitement, whilst the humour feels totally artificial; there are numerous irritating attempts to spice the film up with unexpected visuals (such as about four seconds' worth of shoulder-mounted 'shakeycam' during a chase scene, or Richie's own pointless cameo appearance – Martin Scorsese in Taxi Driver he is not), the impact of the special effects is lost due to incompetent composition (the climax is visually incomprehensible), and the last couple of scenes ('it's a table; it's round, so me and all me mates can sit at it whilst we have a pint and talk about the football, oy-oy!') made me want to vomit in cringing frustration.A wet fart of a film that did what I thought impossible in that it stopped me ranking Assassin's Creed as the worst movie of the year, this is the most deserving big-budget box office bomb since 2015's Fantastic Four. All human life should avoid this disaster.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
305,jahn-00325,Guy Ritchie's half success,7,4 October 2017,"Guy Ritchie is that sort of a director who has already managed to put his name on the map. The latter though leads to an even more challenging task for him to tackle – saving face. His two previous films about Sherlock Holmes were rather experimental for him, being out of his usual manner to shoot. Whereas in the last movie 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword' he appeared to mingle his conventional tricks and some contemporary approaches he seems to have picked up working on the detective's stories. Briefly, he has succeeded merely up to a point, as his creativity becomes simply exhausted drawing to the final of the show.To start with, the topic of the movie is itself a rather complicated subject to bring up, as it seems to have been exploited a great deal: the story of the noble wise king surrounded by his loyal knights gets more and more bland and tedious time after time. However, the director concentrated intensively on a less renowned part of Arthur's life, that is to say, how he comes to power. Thus, the whole story begins with his unfortunate childhood that is depicted brilliantly in the most distinctive way Guy is capable of and definitely among the best episodes in the work along with other pieces portraying the hero's adventure to ancient ruins and his strategic contemplation later. All of those moments are full of taste, cynicism and humour that Ritchie is so good at. On the whole, the first part of the movie gives a new lease on live to the entire legend.In the meantime, the second half suffers from all drawbacks of banal films about legendary heroes: too predictable, bland and extremely pathos. Moreover, the plot starts undergoing some difficulties with logic (the scenes of the struggle in a hut before fleeing from an alarmed city on a boat and with a giant serpent should have been cut out at all) as if hurrying up to finish everything, turning into a complete mess of the dull final battle and pathetic end. Perhaps, what makes all these shortcomings less noticeable is the range of talented actors among who the most significant ones are Jude Law with his sinister maniacal character, Charlie Hunnam as a bold opponent of the latter and Astrid Bergès-Frisbey playing the most mystique role in the movie.In a nutshell, Guy Ritchie has managed only partly to take advantage of his fascinating skills of creating cynical realistic witty movies to give some buzz to the worn out ancient legend of King Arthur. The film is worth watching at least because of its vibrant beginning and talented actors who generally, besides the main characters, can also produce some bright images.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

I don't knock it for that, I knock the story for just being there to serve for making scenes. The movie seems to be made on the basis of ideas like ""Hey, what if we put the giant elephants from LOTRs into this movie?"".You'll probably like it: If you enjoy a series of 3 minute movies. You probably won't like it: If you expect characters to care about, or things to make sense.Guy Ritchie - WTF happened to you? Did success make you too lazy?

I am not sure of the vendetta that the movie people have against this movie other than they hate action movies in general. This is a fun action movie with much substance and girth that you will enjoy, if you like that sort of thing.

I really didn't buy into him saving the country, but they wrapped it up pretty well. The main reason I'm writing this, is something I normally don't do. I just could not understand the casting of Mage. Astrid something, wow. My guess is that she was so focused on pronouncing English properly, that the acting went out the window.

This movie is bad, ridiculous, a mess, boring, uninteresting.

But what the beautiful thing is with this movie is Guy Ritchie's style of directing. He knows how to get a lot of scenes put together to look like just one scene.Let me not forget Charlie Hunnam. He was really great as Arthur and I think he can be the next action hero. He can do the acting and the action a great performance from him.King Arthur Legend of the Sword is a decent movie with a great style of direction from Guy Ritchie.

But all you need to do is to let go of all your expectations and stop comparing it to all the old Arthurs you have seen in the past - - or any Medieval Fantasies for that matter -- and all of a sudden this becomes an extremely fun movie to watch. I have to say I like it! Yes it's the same old story of a hero defeating a big bad guy and saves the day; yes there are plenty of plot holes and cheesy dialogues, but you can't say the way it was filmed wasn't original.

320,whidbeydanielg,Should be called Marvel's King Arthur,3,23 August 2017,"This is a boring remake of a lovely story. It doesn't hold a candle to previous efforts to tell about the Arthurian legend (such as Excalibur, King Arthur, or even Camelot).It's actually a superhero movie. Arthur isn't a man wielding a sword but instead is a Marvel Superhero who, as soon as he grasps the sword, can do all manner of magic tricks with it. And has great POWER!!! The story drags. And at times is weird (the bad guy played by Jude Law gets his own super power by, wait for it, killing some woman he loves and feeding her to a giant octopus).I guess Charlie Hunnam is an acquired taste. I haven't acquired it. He seems wooden, delivering Iron-Man-like witticisms that fall flat. (while we are at it, was Arthur really that witty when facing danger? I didn't know that).It is a huge spectacle, complete with explosions and a universe that looks more like it was from Lord of the Rings than it was from early England (there are even the same CGI huge elephants from LOTR that must have been laying around the set lot).We actually paid good money to watch this. But, in contrast to the bad guy in the movie, I'm not going to kill a woman I love so I can feed her to a huge octopus with human faces so I can get a super power to get my money back).",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
321,crberme,It tries too hard to be cool,5,19 November 2017,"""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" starts from when Arthur is a child, showing how he evolves to be the legend we all know - Excalibur included. It basically has everything you would expect from a 2017 movie of this kind: terrible fate, underdog protagonist that's also kind of rebel and lots of CGI. It tries to be this 'cool take' on the series, trying to bring new elements to an old tale, and I don't think it success.This movie also has weird editing. For most of the time is OK, but then we have moments when scenes overlap with fast scenes that try to explain how a event happens in another moment in time, which sounds cool but it looks like it tries to be too cool and ends up looking out of place. There's also some CGI moments that look cheap and I would forgive unless this movie didn't want to be impressive so hard.Something minor that also bothers me is the fact that Charlie Hunnam and David Beckam have charming and fabulous undercuts while the rest of the characters have more reasonable haircuts for the time the movie occurs. Again, I think the movie is just trying to look cool and it isn't working.To end up in a good note, here's what this movie does right: it entertains, it has some action that fans of good fight scenes and the first half has some well done parts.My recommendation is to just skip this one. It isn't awful, but unless you have nothing better to do for two hours, you're not missing anything.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

I've watched several others works of film and TV about King Arthur and Excalibur so didn't expect much. ... This movie was awesome. ... I loved it. I want to see it again and I really hope it makes enough money to warrant a few sequels. The characters are well cast. Hunnam finally gets his 'leading hero role' which hopefully can turn into a proper franchise. The music was amazing.

325,bobzzy,Forget about king Arthur,10,12 May 2017,"Few months ago when I watched the trailer and considering the fact that Guy Ritchie is directing this I knew one thing for sure - this movie will NOT BE a King Arthur story. What happens here is that Ritchie took the concept of the King Arthur and Excalibur's myths and made a movie out of them in a way only he can (reference - Sherlock Holmes).So what you should expect and what you will get from this movie is: - Charlie Hunnam (excellent actor with huge potential) - Jude Law (no need of comment here, this movie won't be the same without him). Hunnam and Law were one of the reasons I wanted to watch this movie - Hell of a good soundtrack - Excellent overall atmosphere and FX - 100% Guy Ritchie movie - FunWhat you should NOT expect from this movie is regular King Arthur story - quite the same if you had expected a regular WWII story from Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards.

326,Sooner_88,A superb entry to the fantasy genre by a superb director...,9,14 July 2017,"I say that in the fact that fantasy films/television is around every corner. So it's hard to stick out from the norm in today's market of fantasy films/TV. And this movie is a victim of everything negative that comes with fantasy. Is it justified?...NO. This is possibly one of my favorite films of the year(or will be), and is completely shunned by the fact that it's looked at as a bloated costly film setting up a franchise. We already know the critics and naysayers hate origin films. King Arthur looked to be the first in a franchise of 9, and it's a crime that this world can't be more explored in the future. I would of loved to have seen what else writers Jon Harold and Guy Ritchie could of came up with. Now that my rant is over, I can say I loved it. But there are some flaws with the film(or any fantasy film for that matter) keeping it from being almost perfect. That lack of a coherent plot from the main villain other than being generic. Even though Jude Law did a reasonable job, there could of been a more of an explanation for his purpose other than being the evil uncle. The fight scenes could of been more focused and well paced, and the secondary characters could of used better explanations for their purpose, etc. But these flaws are minimum.The score was decent. The cast was likable, and world building was excellent(and the major selling point). The myth of King Arthur was fascinating in this portrayal, and it's a crime we can't see more of it in the future.

OK, the reviews had not been the best, but our guest had enjoyed 'Interstellar' so the bar was at ground level. He was sure to be gruntled The movie is, unsurprisingly, about King Arthur.Young Arthur is set adrift in his boat by his father, Chopper Pendragon. Chopper has a magic sword, but it's not magic enough to stop him turning into a rock after being on the losing side in a medieval death-match with his brother, Vortigern, who wants to be king. He is rescued by some working girls on what is presumably Londīnium's east end and grows to manhood in a brothel and learns the ways of the warrior in the company of a Kung Fu master. Fair enough. He is a pimp with a heart of gold who looks a bit like Ragnar Lothbrook. Things take a turn for the worse when a real Viking called Greybeard beats up one of the girls and Arthur teaches him the sort of lesson that will not soon forgotten, but these Vikings are under the protection of Vortigern who has a side business in child trafficking and Arthur finds himself on the way to Vortigern's palace along with lots of other blokes to see if he can pull a sword out of a stone which he of course does, being Arthur.The sword, which is possibly played by Prince Charles, is a serious enhancement to any young warriors wardrobe, and Vortigern wants it in the worst way but he can't have it while the real King, Arthur, lives and Arthur finds that the sword is a bit of a mystery and he can't use it anyway but Vortigern can so he decides to chop Arthur's head off. A woman mage (a madge?) steps in and saves him and the rest of the film is about whether Arthur can master the sword or will he lose out to Vertigan.Madge tries to help him master it but he chucks it away and meets pond-chick who gives it back to him and tells him ""to suck it up, buttercup"". The sword is called Excalibur. I don't know why, but.King Arthur may not have existed, and even if he did he was likely Welsh or French anyway and there has never been an Arthur II. It is as near as certain as a thing can be that he was not an American, even though he is something of a superhero from the days before Marvel. And as a superhero he goes alright too. He has a sword instead of a hammer and there is a bit of mysticism. There are no Mcguffies. Arthur's mates from the knock-shop sound like the characters from 'Lock Stock and two Smoking Barrels' and I half expected them to call him 'Arfur'. There is a big tower where a Balrog lives, some Vikings, and a giant snake which could be a Voldemort, a dragon, or simply a Freudian nightmare. There are battles and humongous elephants. There is a villain that you just want to hiss at. Given the director's patchy personal marital history, it is unsurprising that he avoids a love interest.Is it any good? Yessirree. Who doesn't go for swords and sorcery? We liked it a lot more than we thought we would. Well worth the Seniors Discount, and we'd fork out to see a sequel too.

Who in the production of this movie upset the aristocracy of film critics to warrant such bad reviews? Did the critic's piggy back on a wave of an elite film cabal poised to tank a Guy Richie sequel? Only in that regard was the movie ruined for me! In fact, I feel compelled to write a review more of the critics than the movie. There is no reason this should be a ""block buster tank."" Sure, the movie had its typical tropes. But all of them were played out perfectly. Sure, the movie had quickly edited scenes typical of a Guy Richie film. But if the critics can't follow along with this movie, it's more of a personal problem with their internal comprehension to process visual dialogue than the fault of a great story. If elite film critics can blast male IMDb reviewers for tanking the female version of ""Ghost Busters"" (which really was bad) then this is their aristocratic payback review for remaking (more like reinventing) an immortalized machismo legend. If you are thinking about seeing this movie, and you like the idea of a mystical ""Lord of the Rings"" Brittan, and if you like a main character finding his way through impossible odds to greatness, and if you enjoy action movies, and if you enjoy an awesome reinvention of a legendary tale, then you should probably go see this movie.

331,obiegimmie,'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword' Review,6,28 May 2017,"STATISTICS (*NO SPOILERS*) ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" is a 2017 fantasy epic directed by Guy Ritchie (""Sherlock Holmes"") and written by Ritchie, Lionel Wigram (""The Man From U.N.C.L.E.""), and Joby Harold (""Edge of Tomorrow""). Music is by Daniel Pemberton (""Steve Jobs""), cinematography by John Mathieson (""Logan""), editing by James Herbert, and production by Guy Ritchie, Akiva Goldsman (""Mr. and Mrs. Smith""), Joby Harold, Tory Tunnel (""My Blind Brother""), Steve Clark-Hall, and Lionel Wigram. It stars Charlie Hunnam (""Pacific Rim""), Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey (""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides""), Djimon Hounsou (""Blood Diamond""), Aidan Gillen (""Game of Thrones""), Jude Law (""The Talented Mr. Ripley""), and Eric Bana (""Hulk""). REVIEW (*SPOILERS INDICATED*) Guy Ritchie is famous for his stylistic and sleek directing style. It has become cinematically significant; holding a British saltiness and wit as well as a quick, bloody, yet entertaining method of action. ""King Arthur"" is no exception. I won't elaborate on the plot, as you probably are somewhat aware of it and rehashing it will only waste both our time. But please, allow me to share my feelings on this film.It is in no way the terrible film the critics are painting is as. It is flawed, but not horrible. If I were to see this film again, it would be to see some nice action and catchy music, not for character or even plot. Arthur, while played nicely, is generic as Arthur's go. I know nothing of Humnam's early work but in this film he was dry and perfectly acceptable. It wasn't a notable performance, per say, but perhaps it wasn't meant to be. And that brings us to Jude Law. As the dimensional power hungry uncle, Law succeeds. I found myself being inexplicably drawn to all of his scenes. He absolutely dominated. This is a strangely brief review, but I think what I have to say is already written. ""King Arthur,"" is a decent film. It won't make any lasting impressions or leave you thinking differently.

Now the list has increased by one, which gains a place at its very bottom: The Legend Of The Sword is a bad movie with some moments of greatness. What makes it bad is the way the story is twisted: for sake of being original, all the magic of the legend is gone, the myth is all lost. We are moving in a scenario between The Lord Of Rings, Indiana Jones and Zack Snyder's movies. As fashion commands, we are overwhelmed by the usual orgy of CGI, including unlikely monsters, gigantic snakes et similia. An element which is particularly ridiculous is about costumes: some of the characters are dressed more like John Wayne in one of his westerns than in an early medieval style.

336,crimson-17255,"Plot was OK, Visuals Great!",9,18 May 2017,"I went to watch this movie because I was bored and found that I enjoyed it (a lot)The story of Excalibur and King Arthur and his knights wasn't anything out of this world. It played out like any other action and historical fiction story I've seen, but the way the story was told, the visuals, and how magic worked was so well done that this is possibly my second favorite film of 2017. I really enjoyed how we had past and present playing at the same time (helped show a lot without making it seem crammed), how magic worked so naturally (and didn't look fake), and the panning during fight scenes! Arthur was such a fun character and I often found myself chuckling at his anticsThe only part that confused me was near the end with the huge serpent. If they could do that, it made me wonder why they didn't just do that from the start. And speaking of serpents, The Mage was also a favorite character of mine",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
337,laszlo-05700,When Guy Ritchie re-imagined British folklore as a Tolkien fantasy,6,19 August 2017,"Oi, as many wrote: this movie bears undeniable Guy Ritchie marks on it. The cuts, the characters, the lines. It's love it or hate it: personally I didn't mind about most of the movie being 'Snatch' based in historic England with some added flavour of magic. But sometimes magic was too much in the form of CGI. I mean it's hard to imagine some englishman woke up in the morning and said to himself: ""Hmm, it would surely be a good idea to include some Titanic-sized war elephants in King Arthur's story, ravaging like dinosaurs. Maybe in the end the elephants could serve some tea to the Queen."" No, that just doesn't roll with the rest of the movie - so in the big picture it felt like that the good, calm part of the movie was directed by a British crew, and the action scenes were done by some Hollywood jack-asses, who think the amount of monsters equal with revenue. I would rate the Guy Ritchie-ish part 8, and the fantasy content 4. But I warn anybody, to handle 'King Arhur' as an average performer - if you can survive the opening scene and doesn't mind the end turning into a pop-corn movie, you are going to enjoy a very unique, very refreshing experience.Maybe they could have casted Arhur with Jason Statham and Vortigern as Vinnie Jones, but let's not go extreme - the actors were fine, it's just some magical force that denied King Arthur from reaching a higher score. Maybe the competing movie studios have taller towers - who knows.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Really the main problem is it's just too much in such a confined time period. It's visually stunning and exciting, but it's like going to Disney World, standing in the middle of the park just looking at everything and trying to decide where to go next. It's all thrilling, but it moves so fast that you can't quite catch up. I honestly feel this would have been an excellent tv series, perhaps on HBO or Starz.

I liked that there was an actual story to be told, especially when it's told with integrity. It focused on the story, whilst being entertaining. Now the methods they chose to make the film entertaining hurt the film. The large scale action sequences were filled with excessive amounts of effects that made scenes blurry. The editing of certain scenes made the film jumbled, and hard to follow. It also has trouble figuring out what the tone should be, jumping between trying to be funny and meta, or gritty and epic. If you're looking for a fast paced medieval flick, and you don't mind that it's loosely based on the Arthurian tale, you'll have a good time with this film just like I did, at least when the film wasn't being weird.

Don't be fooled with the setting of the story, this is still good old Guy Richie telling stories about gangsters, corruption and the mob's inner workings. Our dearest Arthur here is not some goody two shoes, he's a PIMP. He protects his bitches, and defends his interests. The fact of the matter is, he's almost as bad as they come, except for his uncle, who is evil incarnate, sacrificing everything for power. So yes, through the mob, Guy is telling us about who he thinks should rule: not the one who stabs his people in the back, but the one who helps them pimp their rides. In the end, Arthur decides being the biggest PIMP in England is still better than letting his uncle obliterate everything. Because then, who will protect the interests of the small businesses (brothels) ??!Anyway. Enjoyable movie, fun to watch. Dialouges are very good as always.

349,yelofneb-63037,not worth the time,1,23 June 2017,"spoilers may occur, but i'll do my best to prevent them.This movie has so little to do with the traditional legend of Arthur, Excalibur and Camelot, that it seems eminently appropriate to direct those viewers who have an interest in better deliveries of the legend to John Boorman's Excalibur.This current treatment is ideal for those whose experience of cinema began with the advent of gore as the central factor of cinematic experience.That, in itself, is simply an historical development that has to do with audience expectation and would not, in itself, be so disappointing, if it were not for the fact that The Legend Of The Sword has absolutely nothing to do with the legend that has been preserved in poetry, prose and film over generations--rendered in it's best cinema representation at the hands of Boorman, in Excalibur.The ""modern"" or relevant source of the legend has always been Mallory's Morte d'Arthur, and that work drew its strength from a legend that was shared across the Celtic world (yes, the Britons were also Celts) about a redeeming king or savior who would draw his strength from magical sources. That's how the world was at one time. I'm not too sure that it's very different, now.Mallory's original work is actually a study of human behavior in pre-Christian time, a quasi analysis of pre-Christian morality that suggests an inevitably necessary investigation of the validity of the impending new belief in a single god.That idea was the central philosophical principle of Boorman's Excalibur. The current treatment, The Legend Of The Sword, has nothing to do with that. It is simply a Quentin Tarantino similar gore fest, and actually not even as entertaining as Tarantino might have achieved with the same material. In short, it's ridiculous, unfortunately ridiculous. It's an embarrassment, given the legend on which it is supposed to be based.in all honesty, it was a waste of time.i like Charlie Hunnam--he was great as a hamlet on a motorcycle--but this garbage is something that i hope he becomes famous enough to publicly regret.Perhaps the worst thing of all was having to wonder about why Jude Law, who has delivered some very worthy performances, and, here, provokes nothing but audience remorse about his career.Maybe those who've never known anything about the legend might find this movie interesting, but i would worry about the amount of illicit influence they would have to ingest to make that possible.honestly, it's, unfortunately (given the potential actor talent involved) not worth the the time. it's garbage.All in all, don't waste your time on this.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
350,chwalker-christopher,2 movies squashed together; only one of them is good,3,14 January 2018,"I wanted to like this movie. I like sandal epics and swordplay movies set in remote historical eras or fantasy landscapes based on myth and legend. I have relaxed standards about the screenplay for movies in this genre and can tolerate a certain number of clichés or hackneyed stock characters. I am easy to please. This movie started out with some pluses. They spent good money to get experienced actors, and the screenwriters crafted at least a few lines of dialogue for them that gave them something to work with. The half of the movie that presents human beings talking to each other, or fighting, would have been a pretty good movie by the standards of the genre. But the storyboards full of CGI-driven special effects and supernatural nonsense refuses to get out of their way and let us engage with the characters. It's a shame, really. There's a good movie buried under the surface of silly monsters and explosions, here. Fans of Game of Thrones may delight in a small appearance by Lord Bolton, in a supporting role. Lord Baelish is in it, too, but they didn't write to that actor's strengths.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
351,jakethesandbag,"Fun, albeit dumb, experience",7,14 May 2019,"Admittedly, I am not a large Guy Ritchie fan. I find his directorial efforts to be an editor's dream - playing around with non-linear storytelling, with quick-cuts, hacked up scenes; often at the cost of mediocre stories held up by style rather than substance. At his best, he offers intelligent, witty, funny, and fast films, of the likes of Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. At his worst, the mundanity of the story is only held up by the style of his filmmaking persona (looking at you, Sherlock Holmes series). Altogether, his films aren't necessarily bad, but are completely dependable on Ritchie's concise focus and attention to his style. He is certainly not the only, nor most notable director, to do this. Delving briefly in to the ol' auteur theory of cinema, I find it to be very tiring and lackluster for a director/writer/actor/cinematographer/etc. to constantly rehash their same style, to the point of not being able to create something new.All of that being said, Guy Ritchie's adaptation of the classic fantasy fable, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is an excellently crafted, enjoyable, fun, and thrilling action adventure.To be frank, this film was an entire surprise to me. If you are at all familiar with Ritchie's fast-paced aesthetic and intricate way of crafting scenes, it was a surprising breath of fresh air to see his approach in such a high-budget fantasy film in this day age.All too often, films of this ilk in our modern ""tentpole blockbuster cinema"" era are mild, dim, and simplistic. This is done so as not to offend any possible moviegoer. Characters and story structure are often poorly written, and dialogue sounds as if it was meant only for the trailer. Actors can be one-note, direction uninspired, and filmmaking techniques come down to the most basic of high-school setups. There becomes nothing tangible to remember from those two-hours that your sat in the theater.Fortunately, with King Arthur, audiences can be treated to a respectable, efficient, and exciting fantasy adventure.Legend of the Sword is a traditional retread of the classic fantasy tale - Arthur is child of King Uther. But after a coup and betrayal from Uther's brother, Vortigern, Arthur is abandoned to a nearby village, and Vortigern takes the throne of Britain. As he grows older, fate is thrown to Arthur, and he must fight to retake his throne to restore balance in the kingdom. Toss in some mages, magic, giant elephants from a dark-realm, and a sword locked in stone belonging to the true king of Britain, and you have the basic constructs of King Arthur.First and foremost, the screenplay is strict and tight. Dialogue has purpose, characters have goals, and all of them twist and turn around each other in a classic ""hero's journey""-esque way. Furthermore, for how simplistic everything is, it all feels rooted in the reality of the story world presented - all actions are motivated, and there are consequences to every action. Everyone serves a point and purpose in getting us from A to B, but it's what happens between those points that define our characters. Some of this may seem pretty basic, especially when it comes down to action/adventure films. These necessary beats (first act has an unwilling character, second act finds them interested but defeated, third act has the climax and resolve, etc.) are so engrained in our culture because of literary classics, that we have come to expect them, simply because we have seen them time and time again.With Guy Ritchie, however, we get a fresh eye and approach to this traditional tale. Having him tell a classic through his viewpoint makes his adaptation much more like an eccentric bard recounting the tale. Witty dialogue from well-thought out characters; charismatic and enthralling performances from the whole cast; beautiful dramatic cues; intense and well-choreographed action sequences. All of this is compacted into this fairly average, classic story, and it suddenly feels fresh. His sense of filmmaking is at it's peak in this film, with perfectly executed shots (reminiscent of glorious, classical renaissance art) and meticulous editing. His score and music also help compliment every moment, most notably an epic use of the song Lament by Light of Aidan near the start of the film.Now, as I mentioned above, I tend to have a sort of grievance with auteur filmmakers. I often feel that it is somewhat of a cop-out to repeat and barely improve on your past skills as an artist, rather than attempt to learn more about yourself and create something new. However, when a filmmaker is willing to leave their comfort zone, and either A.) Try a new story format with their traditional filmmaking techniques, OR, B.) Try new techniques all across the board, I tend to find more respect for them. By safe-guarding your style, you can only grow in that style, and I find that to be boring. Now, there is also the issue of auteurs being thrust into something, and not allowing them to perform their style. Case in point, when Warner Bros. wants to hire an ""edgy"" director to make Suicide Squad they choose excellent filmmaker David Ayer. However, as they want to produce something that is more appropriate for all audiences, and follows your more average storyline of other superhero films out, they begin to suppress down on all creative control he/she might have. So auteurs are chosen for their style, and then not allowed to practice it in production.A bit of an auteur theory rant (ramble?) here, but my point really comes down to this: As a filmmaker, you should have complete control of your approach to your film. When that control is threatened and not collaborative, your risk the integrity of your work. When you decide to cycle/rinse/repeat your own safeguards, you risk not being innovative, and being completely repetitive.For Ritchie, I feel that King Arthur: Legend of the Sword was a more streamlined and traditional story for him, when compared to his more sporadic, energetic tales. With his unique branding and approach, however, he helped revive it to feel more alive and fun. Albeit dependent at times on his style to make it energetic, the overall experience is like your classic fantasy tale would be: good versus evil, and tons of awesome violence in between.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The ability to immerse the audience in a tantalizing visual effects experience gives this particular King Arthur story a real kick in the butt. I am glad to see that this film has received better reviews than those snooty professional critics who never gave this film a chance. Why is there such contempt for old British folklore and the etymology of the English-speaking world? I believe that there will always be a market for reviving old Caucasian themes and portraying them in modern parlance, but it will be a continuous battle against the increasing faction of the movie world who would rather see a movie that drives a progressive theme about race or social injustice instead of a traditional action-packed movie draped in old English legend.

361,silverace08,epic retelling of the legend of king arthur :P,10,20 February 2019,"Man this movie is nothing i expected, having been a follower of king arthur ever since i was a little boy, i was really looking forward to this movie at first but was quite disappointed when i saw the trailer thinking ""here goes hollywood making another blockbuster just for the masses with all its cgi action violent sequences"" and while this movie is that -to an extent- it goes much beyond anything i could have dreamed of in my wildest imagination-while i wasnt the biggest fan of guy ritchies sherlock holmes, although it was quite good, i felt the action sequences were a big much for a 'sherlock'. simultaneously though, i would rank 'lock stock and two smoking barrels' up there with my all time favourites, probably most of all because of the pure wit in the humour. king arthur follows suit on both front -with modern day action sequences while set in the age of camelot a little more apt for a king than detective i guess (not to hate, sherlock is still dope plotwise). also the fresh humour, that's wittier than ever, and is what made this film purely astounding, kept me chuckling through out. through its unique direction and its cinematography with its cut-scene flash backs, the movie carries its own ritchie- esque reputation, with some great acting as well. basically we have king arthur: turned ultimate bad-ass. so, there isn't much to complain about here at all, and it's definitely on the upmost end of my original expectations, albeit, defying all the traditional versions of king arthur which i still respect for their more 'noble' sensibilities. so, while it may not suit the more old school audiences, who'd still appreciate less cgi action (of which i still count my self as one, marring the odd exception) it'd be unfair to say this movie does
not too deserve it own light to shine as that is what the art of movie making is all about: re-interpreting stories with today's audiences in mind. which is why, i'll admit, i am giving a real tad slightly generous 10 (maybe it'd get a 9 other-wise - yes... in retrospect i am a generally generous reviewer - if you only for once think of all the work that goes into any movie ever made that hits the main screen, you can't really be such a critic, and will always find something to appreciate for all the efforts) for doubting it such initially, and really, to balance the scales since it definitely deserves much more than a 6.whatever it has got so far-truly well done in the original-est sense, and looking forward to the planned sequels. as a skeptic i hope you give it a chance.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The movie was far worse than Xena in every aspect. Don't get me wrong, i loved Xena, but Xena was a series that didn't take itself seriously, it enjoyed its mistakes and turned out to be fun and amusing. This movie was trying hard to look ""serius"" without having anything redeeming. There were some jokes that would be great as comic releaf...if there was any agony that needed this break. But there was no agony, no stress and nothing epic. Black and Asian people in Europe being knights just ruined it totally for me. I don't want to watch a Japanese movie with Black and white Samurais, it will look fake and ridiculous and the same happened here. We have a Kung Fu master teaching young Arthur, well at least they should have Kung Fu panda as well in the movie or Mr Miyagi, it would make it funny. The supposedly terrible Dark lands were nothing more than a place of big rats and oversized animals and this didn't help the movie become scary.

Familiar Guy Ritchie style like snatch, lock stock, Sherlock but never in a way that it feels like a trick done before by him.

It is one of the best movies I have seen in my life. It is more than 2 hours long but does not feel so because you get immersed in the story so much that you lose track of time. Very good dialogues, better special-effects, that British humor, amazing soundtrack and twists in an engaging story. Creativity and originality speaks in every scene. Guy Ritchie is at his best. I will put it on the list of must see movies. I generally do not review much but this movie and Kingsman: The Secret Service and Borther's Grimsby are few great movies from British Cinema one must not miss.Forget about critics and box office performance. I give it at least 9/10 without a doubt. Now I am desperate for part 2.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
370,DarkWench,Nicely done Mr Richie,10,27 September 2017,"This arrived on Bluray Monday and we sat last night with no expectations to watch. From the opening sequences to the end this is an excellent movie, humorous in places in that way the Guy is know for but action packed. It moves away from the usual romantic image of Arthur and in its place gives us a man who is the opposite of a hero. He does not want his birthright he is quite happy ducking and diving, running scams and schemes whilst protecting the brothel and the inhabitants that rescued and raised him. I thought Charlie was very good match for this role, he looses the odd American accent he has and what comes out is good east end boy. For me this gave him a role to actually grow into as I am going to assume there will be more films in this franchise.The cameo by David Beckham is excellent, the expression on his face was worth it!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Guy Ritchie has done it again with this one and apart from the elephants and David Beckham cameo the pace, visuals and music score for this movie are awesome. Worth watching more then once. Charlie Hunnam is the perfect Arthur / Scrappy misfit leader. The casting is genius.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
372,richard-llewellyn-jones,"Feeble Story, Fuzzy too dark cgi mess",1,20 May 2017,This is a dreadful film. It is purely a badly done cgi movie. The graphics were fuzzy and featured third rate monsters that have all had parts in other films.Worse the cgi action did not look realistic and this added to the overall failure.Apart from the fuzzy graphics the story was an abomination and an insult to the memory of King Arthur. There was very little story and the characters acted in such an unbelievable and clichéd fashion that you tended to try and forget them as irrelevant to the excessive computer violence.If you rate John Boormans's Excalibur as a 10 then this is a 0.0001There are better ways to spend £125 million,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Ok, summing up...ultra-fast barely intelligible speeches, awkward CGI, stupid dialogues, ninjas, funny characters, nothing to do with Arthur's legend, but hey, there's a sword, let's call it King Arthur...could as well have been Mario Bros but who cares.
Thank you Eric Bana for giving us those few short enjoyable minutes at least.
I had to split my watching in 2 parts for staying awake. For a lover of '80s Excalibur, this is something closer to Fast and Furious than a serious epic/fantasy movie.
After all that bad CGI I was expecting to see some cyborg like terminator or robocop appearing.

375,tempestnyx,A Generic Fantasy Film | Review of 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword',5,21 June 2017,"Another film about King Arthur. Tales of his majesty and the realm of magic and swordsmanship have been adapted in many ways, from the big screen to the small screen. There hasn't been an accurate adaptation of the tale since Excalibur and the Merlin miniseries, but pivotal characters weren't left behind, weren't forgotten in the telling of those stories. This film, however, seems to have forgotten all about Merlin, Morgan Le Fay and Mordred and the pivotal parts they played in shaping up the Arthurian legend.Instead, this film forgoes most of that to tell the story of King Arthur, through treachery, who is raised on the streets, my prostitutes. It's not a bad beginning and does shape up Arthur to be this tough woman-protecting man, a man with a semblance of honor. But Arthur, he doesn't really develop through the film. He goes through a lot but until the end, the very end, his character doesn't grow at all. He remains a cocky smartass. Now, as charming as that may be at times, to watch it through the entire film is tiresome. The same could be said for the entire film. None of the characters really change except maybe one who ends up dying. That being said that doesn't mean the film was fill of bad acting. Charlie Hunnam was perfect for the part and in any rendition of the tale, regardless of what story they decided to put on the screen, he would have fit it and made it his own and would have given an amazing performance regardless of the story and the direction of the story. However, there was Astrid Bergès-Frisbey who wasn't enticing at all. The way she delivered her lines was very monotonous, very emotionless. She didn't make watching her very captivating at all.As far as the story went, there were parts that were too long and unnecessary. Anytime there was dialogue of Hunnam being a smart ass, while it started out funny, it stopped being funny after a while to the point where it was like ""come on, get on with the story already."" Then there was the entire sequence of events in the dark lands that made no sense. They are talking about how he was supposed to find himself there, humble himself, but the entire sequence of events was devoted to special effects and bigger than life monsters. It was not essential to the story at all. Then there were the scenes that were so heavily reliant of CGI that was reminiscent of Beowulf. And the ending, now that was just something out of a video game. Personally, I would have rather seen Jude Law wielding his magic and sword fighting Charlie Hunnam rather than the CGI contraption that was given to audiences.I will say this though, as mediocre ass this film was, the sea witches were a cool element. And the armor was not only cool looking but practical as well. (★★☆☆ | C)",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

378,jippy33,Surprisingly entertaining Arthurian tale,8,9 October 2017,"I was hesitating with this movie after all the negativity surrounding it's release, only to discover that it was quite enjoyable.Is it a true epic? No.Is it plastered in mediocre CGI? Yes.Is the acting brilliant? Meh...Is the Guy Ritchie touch fitting for a medieval fantasy? That is, of course, subjective (as is everything when it comes to movies), but for me, it worked. You know the Guy Ritchie touch? Fast cuts, stories told in quick flashbacks, crazy editing, POV-camera angles while running at full speed down a street. It is what made Lock Stock and Snatch such an intense thrill-ride. It might seem out-of-place in a movie like this so keep an open mind.Dunham is good, maybe not ""carry-a-movie"" good, he basically plays himself. I did not know Arthurian England had such wonderful American accents.The CGI is painfully obvious at times though, which hurts immersion quite a bit.All in all, this movie is what I would call highly entertaining without ever excelling.

If it's not some nihilistic crap with a depressing ending that fits a liberal narrative or has a female heroine it gets bashed. This movie was a lot of fun, great visuals, a welcome departure from the tired old ""Arthurian"" story, lots of action ,likable characters,despicable villain, good ending.

382,Othy59,Doesn't deserve to be called King Arthur.,3,4 December 2017,"What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said before. Well for starters, most films tend to have a promising start before either falling into mediocrity or rising to greatness. However, from the get go this film was just a confusing mess of CGI with absolutely no plot what-so-ever and they just continued to roll with this mess all the way through. I can understand trying to reinvent King Arthur for the modern audience, but not THIS way! The film was the worst kind of boring too, it was a boring without personality to boot. If this was to be the start of a franchise, then this so-called runner not only stumbled out the gate, it did a messy bone-breaking tumble before falling off a cliff into an ocean of sharks! PS. If you do want one positive from me - I liked the look of post-Roman Londinium. But it can't decide if it is a film that is in or out of history. If you're in post-Roman Britain, make it look that way. Not Dark Age people running around in Lord of the Rings-esque plate armour!

383,sfwriter999,Arthur King of Thieves,8,30 September 2017,"This movie isn't really a King Arthur movie. It's really a fantasy movie with some characters named after King Arthur characters and a magic sword.Guy Ritchie has mastered the art of montage. The growing up montage and even the Dark Lands quest montage are brilliant, telling what could be a full act of the movie in several minutes.Though some characters have King Arthur names, they're pretty much just some card board characters with various looks and quirks, not full characters. Most of the women have great costumes, but are there as backdrops and scenery.Most of the acting and dialogue is modern as is the action sequences.That said, I really enjoyed the movie.

They often went with a more modern rock type of music, which can fit in some movies even fantasy adventurous ones, but I think all of the tracks were not good choices, and so it did not leave a very good impression on the scenes.So after seeing it, I do not have a desire to see it again, and did not enjoy it that much.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

389,PhilipVier,What on earth went wrong here?,3,12 April 2019,"For years I have been a fan of Guy Ritchie's work. I consider him to be a very good director who is capable of telling great stories. Whether it's quirky British gangster stories (Lock stock, or Snatch) or great action epics (like the Sherlock Holmes movies) he always manages to deliver. When I heard he was going to do a King Arthur film I didn't know what to think. I'm not really familiar with the King Arthur legend and after seeing Antoine Fuqua's terrible version I was wondering if Legend of the Sword was going to be just as bad. Unfortunately, it turned out to be even worse. Much worse.In a strange way this film is actually what I would expect if Guy Ritchie directed an epic fantasy film. The only problem is that it's directed extremely poorly. As I mentioned earlier, I don't know much about the King Arthur story, but after watching this film I feel like I know even less about it. This film has a very strange way of telling its story. For example, in the beginning of the film we see Arthur growing up from a boy to a man, but we are shown this in a weird scene with typical fast Guy Ritchie editing. So this is supposed to be about thirty years of his life that we're seeing, but it's told in two minutes. Because of this we learn nearly nothing interesting about Arthur, and he becomes a bland character. The rest of the story is told mostly by very boring characters through very boring exposition. I felt like the film rarely tried to show us what was happening and focused more on telling us. Aside from Arthur, the other characters are terrible as well. I almost felt like there weren't any characters at all, but just lifeless puppets who come on when something needed to be done and just left when they were finished.Another problem I had was the acting. This film stars some good actors like Charlie Hunnam, Jude Law, Djimon Hounsou, and Eric Bana, but with the exception of Jude Law no actor here has any good moments. For the most part I liked Charlie Hunnam in Sons of Anarchy, he showed that the could be quite intense and intimidating, but as Arthur he is unbelievably boring. Throughout this whole picture he has only one facial expression, and it's not even an emotional one, just complete blandness. Only Jude Law as the villain has one or two good scenes, but that's it. I felt he could have been a great villain in a better film.But probably my biggest problem with this film was how it looked. Supposedly, this film had a budget of 175 million dollars. My question is where did the money go? Granted, the scenery is nice and there are a few decent action scenes (the chase scene comes to mind). But for the most part the special effects look absolutely dreadful. The worst example is the giant snake I mentioned earlier; it really looks embarrassingly bad. If Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets could make the basilisk look convincing nearly fifteen years earlier, why can't this film do it? Then again, maybe I shouldn't expect too much from a film that can't even make an eagle look convincing. I mean really? They wanted to show an eagle flying about and they had to use computer effects for it? Also, this film could have used a lot more colour and a less sterile look, which for some reason seems to be very common these days.After watching this, and other recent Hollywood motion pictures, I'm beginning to feel like this is the end of the art of filmmaking. Nearly every big film these days has to have a budget of a 100 million dollars or more, but where does the money go? It seems like it just gets flushed down the toilet. Most big films these days usually have bland acting, terrible special effects, and dark and sterile cinematography. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a prime example of this.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

But once he pulls the sword from the stone, he is forced to acknowledge his true legacy - whether he likes it or not.""Guy Ritchie's style didn't come in the way of the storytelling, in fact it helped a lot. Some fans will have pleasure during a dialogue near the beginning of the movie who looked like it was taken straight out of Snatch. It was a really quick and fun dialogue tat set you up for the kind of movie you are into. The magic in this movie is really well made, and awesome. They used more liberty with this aspect than the previous movies of Arthur. The first 10min was a super entertaining intro to a movie. The CGI looked good for the most part, but as all movies, some scene were not as good as others. Charlie Hunnam was good in this movie, nothing to complain about. Astrid Bergès Frisbey who played the Mage did a good job, and happy to see different faces as one of the lead actor. The other, such as Jude Law, Djimon Hounsou, Eric Bana and Aiden Gillen were fine too. The editing was fast paced for sure. Some parts i would have liked to see more, but instead of a 30min action scene, they cut it for 5min. So the movie was definitely cut down, even though I know Guy Ritchie likes to make scenes like that. It didn't kill the movie, because not long after we got a full well shot action scene. Would still like a 3 hour movie...In the end, I would really like to see some more of the King Arthur/Guy Ritchie world. Some characters felt like they were undeveloped, even though it's a movie about Arthur (and very well developed). If you like medieval movies with some fantastic elements, Guy Ritchie filters and a good time, I suggest you to watch this movie. The critics got it wrong, and so the rest of all Ritchie's movies.

It's a kind of ''Snatch'' set in Medieval England. I found myself wishing that Eric Bana played Arthur but instead he was in it for only 5 minutes. There was no sign of Sir Gallahad or Merlin but it turns out this was because it is being set up for a sequel. Which if you were a fan of Guy Ritchies other film ''Rock'n'Rolla'' you know that this is never going to happen. He likes to set up a film up for a sequel but will only make it if the first film does well at the box office, and since Arthur was a bomb then this is unlikely.

For fans of Merlin (The BBC Series) there is a cameo from Katie McGrath (Morgana). Decent casting but acting way over the top. The same over-the-top style is used for both minor battles and major ones, making some of the huge plot points arrive in a fizzle rather than a bang.

Kind of historical event or classic story tale and good vs evil and all beautifully presented, getting rid of all unnecessary conversations. Going straight to the emotion, the action, the epic moment, the scene of characters, the symbolism at its most shallow yet conceivable manner.The most important thing in a CGI-heavy movie is that the CGI style needs to be consistent. We know that we are in a fantasy, but we don't want the details of the movie to constantly remind us of it.

409,alangmcw-850-641963,Terrible,1,18 May 2017,"I saw this movie as a new release a few days ago. It was one of only two movies available in the small town where I was.I have to say that I found it truly awful in almost every respect. It had clearly cost a bit of money to make, and it does use some quite fancy computer-produced action graphics, but this doesn't compensate for a boring and badly told story-line - with some of the most pathetic dialogue you are ever likely to hear. To make matters worse, none other than David Beckham manages to show up (as himself it seems) somewhere in the middle to spout some garbage. Even those who can claim to have some acting credentials fail to make their words worth listening to.The movie already seems to have several positive reviews here – but I can only assume that these must come from the ultra-geek community, rather than from your average punter who fancies an entertaining night at the movies. A lesson learned the hard way, and a waste of time and money.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
410,cjfrasure,It goes to show ya...the critics get it really wrong sometimes.,9,23 January 2018,"This is, fairly objectively, a really good movie. I have talked with a couple of dozen friends about it, and they ALL liked it. A lot. There are things to complain and curmudge about, I suppose, if you are trying way too hard to complain and curmudge. I have no idea how this flopped at the box office(s).
So, I'll blame the critics for missing the greatness of this movie. It starts with a who's who of British acting talent, under the direction of none other than Guy Ritchie, who has a modem take on a classic legend, huge sweeping scenes in beautiful landscapes, a big dose of magic, and is woven through cinematography that is on par with the best action epics ever. How did you people get it so wrong? Did you sleep through the viewing? My only complaint is that the imdb trailer has a Led Zeppelin song, but the movie does not. That's it. That's all I've got. Everything else is to notch, premium, grade freakin' A, videographic entertainment. There are a few Guy Ritchie quirks and wrinkles, like fast-action montages to explain years of the story, or that oddball shot that looks like the cameraman is actually a Go-Pro camera attached to a guy who is running next to the subject of the shot. And it works. Jude Law plays the villain and he kills. Yeah, I went there. 
And the music, with a distinctly Celtic flavor, was outstanding and enhanced the visual effects really well. I recommend this movie without hesitation. 9/10",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
411,thing4m4jig,Prepare to dive in head first,6,3 July 2017,"I don't blame people who claim this movie is a hell of a mess; but this doesn't have to be a drawback. It's a mess in a comic book/video game style that made me think of ""Scott Pilgrim vs the world"" a lot. If you buy the tickets unprepared for something ultravisual and tech-savvy, chances are you're gonna be exhausted with it. Personally I loved it. This movie is why cinemas still make sense in times when we can watch anything at home anyway. It's a movie designed for cinemas, to be savored as an all-encompassing experience, not just a visual one. The way the story was told made a lot of sense too. I loved the way in that Arthur's young years were explained away - it made a lot of sense with regards to his ability to manage people. It was not only charisma; these were years of practice. The legend is properly told. It's simple, and it's epic, and it's the same old story that is so ingrained in our culture that we tell and retell it again, and it's never boring. There is the good father and the evil uncle - the dual nature of the same blood; there's a young boy who's lost and a coward and who turns his eyes away from the darkness; and who has to face it to regain control and become the man he's meant to be.I think it's an art to tell this story well and to put emphasis in all the right places. That's the value of this film for me. P.S. And it's funny AS HELL.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
412,bibo-93638,Good Intentions and Special Effects are never enough... Keep Away,3,14 May 2017,"Dear Director Richie, I had high expectations for your movie, King Arthur, following your Sherlock Home movies, which were quite impressive in terms of script, acting, and style. However, half through the movie, I did regret my rather naive decision to defy ""critics and friends"" by actually going to see a movie that most ppl seem to be calling ""the First Summer flop"". In order to make sure I have covered everything, I will be relying on bullet points and a rather ""traditional approach"" using pros and cons. So here it goes.A. Why it doesn't work:a. Special effects used in your Sherlock Holmes movies (which relies on observation, deduction etc..) were applied to King Arthur..Needless to say that that wasn't really a good idea as you can clearly notice that the story genre and scope does not fit with that kind of effects (ie especially in ""fast fwding"" specific actions that need not be fast forwarded in the first place) b. The Music...it simply doesn't work (mostly for the same argument used for the special effects) c. The script...truly a disaster, predictable, flat to the point that one can easily feel that the characters are not convinced of what they are saying. d. Character Development: Completely absent..No character background, Progress..what does the protagonist want and what does he plan to achieve ? In other words, it is very difficult to care about any of the characters on screen, which I believe is a key issue in any movie. e. The story: Good Vs evil, build a tower to get more powerful (tower of babel maybe ??), and fighting all the creatures you ever thought of...Just one piece of advice: Please watch the original ""excalibur"" movie, and you would understand any viewer's frustration. f. Too much emphasis on the sword (even though it is only an object after all, and we can't really interact with it as viewers) without any explanation over how it resurfaced (it was supposedly under deep water...) g. Overlong with nothing New happening from one scene to the next (except for armies confronting each other and people flying and hitting walls at some point..)B. Why it works (still trying to find some positive aspects...) Well..it doesn't work at all...the cast is well chosen (Law, Hunnam..no comment for the choice of beckham) and there are good intentions over all to make the movie look ""modern"" while still being ""ancient"" and ""bombastic"" while still looking ""medieval"" and colorless. But when combining all these elements together, you end up with strictly nothing but a fiasco of independent elements that fail to make a whole.Briefly speaking: Stay away, Keep away..even on DVD. I am sure every viewer is able to find a better use of the 2 hours running time (feels like a decade though..)",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Having been thoroughly won over by GOT; I really wanted this to be an awesome movie. It was not.Despite an exceptional cast and quirky (yet refreshing dialogue), King Arthur reaches a bit too far. While they made it abundantly clear that Charlie Hunnam was sufficiently rocked up for the role, his cardio deficiencies were also clearly evident.I must commend their inventive use of the musical score which virtually integrates itself into the physical action. But as with much else in this movie, the brilliant aspects seem to be evenly countered by the negative ones.

Without much expectation, I went in to watch the movie in 3D (because I am a 3D buff) and I was blown away. It got the best 3D I've seen since Avatar! Story and delivery, the action and presentation, I think they were great as well.I saw this movie with a friend, who is conservative and faithful to the original King Arthur legendary story, saying that they changed the story. Well, I said back that the story she'd known wasn't even a historical fact so why complain? My friend, however, agreed that the story plot in this movie is solid and well executed. Arthur's character was well developed in the movie. Also agreed that the 3D was way better than the latest Pirates movie we just saw last night.To be honest, I am disappointed that this movie was not introduced and promoted well here in Japan. I never saw any trailer on TV! I had no prior knowledge about the director and the lead actor. It was only after seeing this film that I got impressed. This movie deserved much more publicity and thorough introduction.This movie is really entertaining from start to finish that I saw it twice already. If there would be a sequel with the same director and lead cast (and I hope there will be), I surely will rush to the theaters to see it.I don't want to write any spoilers here but I definitely recommend this movie and guarantee satisfaction.

For example Merlin is never really seen, the legendary wizard and he is never actually seen in the movie. What I hated most about the movie was the sort of quick-time events. These are basically story elements that I would have loved to watch, essentially the story arc, the interesting bits of the whole movie and they are ALL done in these quick time snippets, basically the whole growing up story of Arthur's child is done in less than 2 minutes. The whole plan how to take down the sitting king and half the process of doing it is done in these quick time events, so all the interesting parts are basically done in these short snippets, while all the boring stuff is drawn out immensely.For example after being rescued King's Arthur son and his rescuers ride for some secret outpost and this whole thing lasts for like 10 minutes of the movie. Just useless, uninteresting, filler banter. Yes there are some good parts here and there, the whole escape arc is interesting enough, there is decent CGI throughout, but fight scenes for example are crap, these are the sort of shaky camera, cut camera, weird camera position fights that literally melt your brain how bad and hard to see stuff they are. Its like torture, you can't make out anything and unfortunately those are the fight scenes. Game of Thrones as a TV series has 50x times better fight and war scenes.

423,LiteKoi,King Arthur: Legend of the Sword - NO Spoilers,7,20 September 2017,"An interesting and very different take on a well-known story. I'm not rating this on how it's faithful to the original story but as a story on its own.I had a good time watching this, only two things preventing me from rating this significantly higher.The unique style of Guy Ritchie is back once again and if you don't like his films, you should probably avoid that one too. Otherwise, it might be worth a shot.The acting is damn good. Charlie Hunnam is excellent as usual. We also get a strong performance from Astrid Bergès-Frisbey, Neil Maskell (playing Back Lack) as well as his son Blue portrayed by Bleu Landau (though they are both underused). Now Jude Law's acting was masterful in my eyes. One of the strongest performances I've seen in a couple of years. His character is well written, the acting is so good that just watching him in action, going through stuff, interacting with other characters, felt surprisingly and utterly satisfying. One of my favourite scene is the one when he meets adult Arthur face to face for the first time, brilliant!As said earlier, Guy Ritchie also imposes a unique style that gives a unique aura to the film. Clever use of editing, fast pace rhythm, and dynamic camera work during action sequences all serve to show something very compelling and refreshing. The music and sound effects work extremely well, especially in that area, though I will say that I'm the kind that enjoys being able to truly see what's going on in action sequences which wasn't really the case here.The story is very straightforward, simple and I mean that in a good way, I enjoyed its development.The first issue I have with the film is something that I've been experiencing more and more in the past few years. I now watch a lot more of series than I do watch films. One of the main advantage of a series is that it usually has way more time to tell its story, develop its characters, plot, universe etc. Here, it felt to me that a single film is definitely not enough to cover all the things that it goes over in a way that is satisfactory. All of the arcs felt more or less rushed because the story needs to reach its conclusion but as a result, it lacks depth, feeling of achievement and ultimately gets a bit frustrating.Finally, there is a lack of emotional impact which is the main reason I can't rate this higher. If the film had managed get me more involved on an emotional level, through character depth and interactions with one another, it would have made a significant difference when something important would happen. I loved the music and it helped to convey the necessary emotions a lot but it still fell a bit short of the mark as far as I'm concerned.I definitely recommend this film if you like Guy Ritchie's style. If you don't know him at all, this may be kind of a gamble. I think the first trailer for the film gives a decent idea of what it looks like, you can watch it and see if it looks appealing to you.Final verdict: 8,2/10. This rating isn't an attempt to evaluate the actual objective value of the film but merely reflects my appreciation of it.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The only good performance in this latest King Arthur movie is Eric Bana's. The lead actor doesn't impress me at all. The plot had a potential, but the delivery was all over the place. And the camera work was absolutely the worst part of this movie. This was only the second time I fell asleep in a movie cinema (The other one being 2014's Godzilla).

The movie was trying too hard to be smart, quick-witted and cool but ended up being overly complicated with tiny plots that really did not matter in the end. Arthur tried so hard to use wits against numbers but in the end had to go in using brute force. All the little mind games for nothing. All he had to do was parade a little with mighty sword and he had his army. Sorceress who has all the powers in the world but lets herself get kidnapped. The damsel remains in distress even for a powerful sorceress. Acting from those top actors was not enough to save the movie and its poor dialogue.

It's no original King Arthur movie, but it's undeniably entertaining.

Even Jude Law can be seen in some scenes brooding and probably thinking: ""What the hell am I doing in this movie?"" Eric Bana also seems confused, unable to truly comprehend what landed him in this Disneyland of movie disasters. If I was an actor in this dreadful movie, I'd fire my agent. Then myself.* THE CHARACTERS:...Who?* THE COSTUMES: You'd think the movie was set in the 21st century judging by what they're wearing. Jude Law wears a suit. ""Arthur"" is seen wearing your average everyday workout clothes, with occasional casual chic hipster outfits. Speaking of the 21st century, they talk like your typical chavs and modern thugs. Who could possibly think both these costumes and this dialect would fit into the legend's era, ye m8 Gwy Ritches das who* THE PLOT: I only use the word ""plot"" because it's supposed to exist in every movie. The pacing is too fast and the scenes cut into each other leaving you wondering what in the world is happening, so let's slow it down a bit. Let's slow it wayyy down. ""Arthur""s character development consists of him getting punched throughout the years. And that's about it. In his adulthood, he's arrogant and disliked by everyone, even people closest to him. Even the people who want him to take the throne are really discouraged and openly express their resentment towards him. The only character you slightly sympathize with is Jude Law's, apparently supposed to be Satan himself in the movie. You know it's bad when you're wishing for the ""good"" guy to actually die by the end of the movie. The Mage, some poorly attempted Merlin rip-off, conjures a huge snake by the end of the movie to kill the bad guys.

You can tell they're not authentic because it's basically the same recycled garbage over and over. There's no way that many people are actually liking this movie because it simply doesn't add up to the amount of people who truly went to see it.

It's either ""Ritchie at his best!"" or ""Absolutely horrible!"". To be fair I think this film lands somewhere in between.First off the kind of editing and dialogue Ritchie favours doesn't really fit heroic fantasy, it makes the film come off as an overly long episode of Xena Warrior Princess mixed up with too many flashback moments. However, knowing Ritchie was behind the film I was prepared for this and was able to let it go.Next thing, I don't even understand why this film is called King Arthur. The story is a High Fantasy epic that borrows a few names and crumbs of plot from the Arthurian myths, and adds warlike wizards riding elephants the size of buildings to the mix. It would have been a better film if it had rid itself entirely from Arthurian names and set the story in a completely fictional universe. That would have saved us from the cringe-factor of having some sort of Kung-Fu master training street urchins in a London dojo, for example. I'm all for being creative and new takes on old source material, but that was a bit too much.All in all, the film IS entertaining, which is what it sets out to be. It really shouldn't be taken seriously, just get some popcorn and leave your brain at home.

436,WinterWoodwere1,A Royal Mess,1,11 November 2019,"King Arthur legend of the sword was an abysmal cinematic experience. The ugly color palette which served as a crutch for the overused and unbearably bad CGI, which itself was an attempt to mask the sloppy writing.Most of this movie can be considered ""Immersion breaking"" as if the filmmakers didn't want the audience to be interested in what was happening: Derivative slow motion of animated swords breaking through animated objects flinging more animated dust into the background was the make up the bulk of the ""action"" in this movie. Flat characters desperately try and move the muddled plot along, and could have been replaced with stagnant props to lower this movies astronomical budget, and doing so wouldn't have altered their impact on the plot.
It's a movie bankrupt of creativity or emotion. Lacking an interesting villain, protagonist or world for these things to inhabit, King Arthur Legend of the Sword was a total failure.Having seen this in theaters in its opening week, it was clear that as a human, this movie was not aimed to appeal to me, nor many others. The small group I was with and the other two people in the theater were luckily the only ones to have the misfortune of seeing this atrocity in that particular showing.It's hard to find something in this movie that can be considered redeeming, but if I had to name anything, it's that the movies poor performance in the box office would indicate that few others were subjected to this cinematic abomination.Whether they followed ""the true King Arthur story"" or did it justice is completely irrelevant. This movie fails on a story and emotional level, as it doesn't attempt to tell anything besides slow motion bloodless, emotionless fight scenes. This movie fails at a visual level because of the previously mentioned reliance on bad, muddled CGI coupled with the uninspired costume and set design. The score of this movie is generic most of the time, and any hint of something interesting in the soundtrack is utterly ruined by the terrible visual accompaniments. This movie fails on an acting level, which may be an unfortunate circumstance of editing or writing, but does not work for the final product.Ultimately, this movie was a failure on almost every conceivable level. Looking back it's amazing that it did as well as it has critically or financially, which was not good to begin with. A harsh review to be sure, but well earned by a failure on a scale comparable only to the gargantuan Elephants in the opening scene.Final Score: 4/100",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
437,pastorjdh,Fantastic Entertainment and Spiritual Encouragement,9,29 September 2018,"Wow! What did I just watch? 
I passed this movie up when it came out because of lackluster reviews. I am glad my expectations were low. This is possibly one of the best action packed, fun, thrilling and fast paced movies of the decade. 
If you like Avengers, I would say this fictional account, of the legend of the sword, is sure to please. 
The one thing I was not expecting, is the spiritual aspect about good vs. evil and the answer to why evil exist. I won't give it away, for those who have not seen the movie, but the story gives a great reason for the evil, opposition, struggle and difficulty in life, that we all face. It can make us great or destroy us, depending on how we handle it. 
My one complaint is that some amazing parts were rushed through and this should have been at least three hours. It could have been an amazing trilogy or short series. What a shame it had to be crammed into two hours.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
438,laonephasele,Honestly I love this movie,9,24 September 2021,"It's take on king arthur is stuff of legends. It explores how his uncle actually turned him into what he was. He was comfortable in his life. No care but then his uncles statred killing the ones he loved. I still remember the line"" I'm not getting into this."" . The part where he said he is nothing but the bastard son of a whore( give or take if I remember it correctly), was just spectacular. The king's paranoia essentially drove his own failure. Great actors on all parts. The death of backlack was just........"" Today on my last day, a commoner being visited by a king."". Guy ritchie is a genius. This is overwhelmingly the most underrated movie ever.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
439,JimBurd,Horrible and unwatchable,2,25 September 2017,"Maybe it's a Guy Ritchie thing. Maybe you love him or hate him. But for me, this movie just sucked big time. I never really cared about any of the characters, except for maybe the Mage. Multiple times during the movie, the scenes switch rapidly back and forth between 'past' and 'present'. Big effing whoop! It was needlessly confusing, and didn't add anything useful to the movie. I would have been SOO much happier if the scenes has just been displayed in Chronological order.And the scene at the end, where the Norse leader threatens Arthur and then capitulates for no obvious reason ... what the hell was that all about? It added nothing to the story line, and it just came off (to me) as COMPLETELY nonsensical. If the Norse were as strong as depicted, then there's no way they would have capitulated so quickly and meekly. Total rubbish.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The movie provided excitement and humor mixed with a little drama, and to me the cinematography was awesome. The soundtrack was spot on. People quit being so politically correct, no one cares... if it makes you mad that there weren't enough woman in the movie or not enough CGI or what have you then make your own movie or go out side and build a tree house since movies aren't up to par for you.

442,leteca-tina,"It is a Guy Ritchie movie, isn't it?",9,23 September 2017,"I decided to write my first review on this movie, because I believe it has been judged based on things it should't have been.. Critics warning people not to see it, like they know what they are talking about, like they are always right..Expecting anything else from a Guy Ritchie movie other than a Guy Ritchie movie is dumb. His editing style is his, it is recognizable (read a review by a person that had a problem with cuts and jumps in the movie.. this person had obviously been living under a rock and hasn't seen Lock Stock or Snatch or RocknRolla, so is disappointed with a movie etc.), and for me it made this movie fun, it made me want to keep watching because it is a historical movie done differently (A Knight's Tale comes to mind). If you want something historically correct then read a history book. If you want two hours of fun, good looking dudes and good action scenes, than this movie is for you. It's a historical fantasy action drama comedy, don't expect anything else.Plus the soundtrack is amazing, which always helps!I am not good at summing up a movie, so i won't, just thought this needed to be said.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
443,dbcint,"So, we're really doing this again, huh?",2,30 May 2017,"I have nothing against remakes. Most remakes are, by their very nature, an alternate take on a story we've already heard. And given that there's more than one way to tell a story, remakes offer a great opportunity to bring something new, different, and fresh to a story we thought we knew.So even when it's a story I was never particularly interested in – such as the legend of King Arthur – a remake at least sparks my interest because of the potential it might hold. And I do like aspects of the King Arthur story. The sword in the stone is the classic underdog story, and as someone who's worked on more group projects than I care to count, the very idea of the round table is something I've actively encouraged.The problem here is the number of times this story has been told, and the lack of interest shown by its opening weekend box office numbers can probably be attributed to that, and the fact that the last big-screen telling of this story was not well received. But the fact that the BBC's version ran for five seasons suggests there is still some interest in the story, so maybe there's still something there. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is director Guy Ritchie's take on the classic story, and it's not entirely terrible. To be fair, there are parts of this that I really liked, and when I think back on those parts, I honestly do wish I could call this movie something other than ""not entirely terrible"". Our introduction to and characterisation of Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) is done spectacularly. When Arthur is being interrogated and has to give an account of his day, the way he tells that story is easily the best scene in the movie. From the constant interruptions to the names of certain characters (""Chinese George"" and ""Flatnose Mike""), this scene is just so damn entertaining.That's not just because of the way it's told, though, it's also because Hunnam is absurdly charismatic. This is the first scene in which he stands out, and he goes on from there to truly carry the movie. The only other character of any note is Jude Law as Vortigan, Arthur's uncle and the villain of the film.As smarmy as anything, Vortigan is power-hungry and willing to do anything – including killing his loved ones – in order to achieve that power. Arthur, due to having pulled the sword from the stone and thereby become the rightful king, poses a threat to that power. While Arthur is the kind of person who doesn't particularly care about power and would probably be quite happy running has bar in peace, he can see how evil Vortigan has become, and knows he is the only one who can stop him.So, here's the problem with King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. With all the possible directions that Guy Ritchie could have chosen to take this story, he decided to make a superhero origin story. We spend the first half hour or so learning who our hero is, there's an inciting incident (pulling the sword from the stone) that gives him his powers, then there's the discovery of a villain, which leads to a final battle. There's even a training montage amongst all that. To my mind, this is the worst direction Ritchie could have gone in for this story. There are movie fans who are already claiming they have ""superhero fatigue"", and among all those superhero movies, the origin story is the most common kind of movie – and there are still more to come in the next few years. I'm not saying that these are bad movies (the Marvel ones are usually a lot of fun, and as of this writing, I haven't seen Wonder Woman). But for a King Arthur movie to take this direction is just baffling. This was a great opportunity to tell a completely different kind of story, and it just feels wasted.Not only that, but it's not a greatly exciting story. Some fun scenes aside, such as when Arthur's men are training with arrows, I spent a lot of time watching this thinking that it would be a total shitshow if not for Charlie Hunnam. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword has become something of a box office bomb, and it's not hard to see why. About a year ago, The Legend of Tarzan made barely a blip on the box office radar – and that was a vastly superior movie. But does the box office result for that not show that people aren't interested in re-tellings of old, mythological / pseudo-historical movies? If no-one was asking for a Tarzan movie, what made Warner Bros. think they'd be more successful this time around, with a King Arthur movie?Honestly, I can't really think how WB thought this could be anything more than ""not entirely terrible"". OK, so they had an A-list actor (Jude Law) to play their villain, and a truly dynamite performance from Charlie Hunnam as Arthur, and when there are scenes that work, they work brilliantly. But the rest of this is nothing you haven't seen several times in the last decade or so, and in a genre where you really shouldn't be seeing this kind of stuff.

444,briandernsferd,An epic that we need more of,8,10 May 2021,"The fact that this has a 6.7 rating is absolutely beyond me! Literally the only thing anyone can complain about with this movie is that it's too fantastical, or it doesn't stay grounded to the original ""myth"". 🙄 Or maybe the Game of Thrones fanatics that wanted more violence or nudity.The cast is absolutely perfect, it has such powerful storytelling, and it's so much fun! I hate that every time we get a quality fantasy, people just don't appreciate it. I love all movies, but the Fantasy Adventure flicks always have a special place for me. Aside from the obvious like Lord of the Rings & Harry Potter; Some of my all time favs are Stardust, The Mummy & Clash of the Titans. And then this one was right up there with them. And we were supposed to get multiple sequels and that was the most excited I'd been about upcoming movies in a while, yet the narrow viewpoints of of the majority erased those chances. Now we get the repetitive garbage of generic summer action films like Hobbs and Shaw, and we'll just stick with Marvels all too common formula. Don't get me wrong I enjoy those, but why can't we handle more imagination and stepping outside of the box sometimes? After all, that variety is what makes the movies so great.If anyone with a say in production is listening, we need more like this! Please!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
445,AaronDSimpson,Snatch versus A Knight's Tale,7,3 July 2017,"If you were to number every man that has attempted to draw Excalibur from the stone throughout the lore that surrounds King Arthur, you would find that there have been an equivalent number of imaginings of Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table, in both film and literature; from the Historia Brittonum (828 A.D.), to the Annales Cambriae (12th Century), to Guy Ritchie's King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017).Considering the importance of Arthurian legend in establishing a coherent British national identity, there are many of us that are familiar, even if only in part, with the tales of the Pendragon bloodline. However, for those of us that aren't, Ritchie's introduction to King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is one that fails to offer a foundation of substance to the viewer ill at ease with this segment of British mythology. The audience is exposed to an opening ten minutes which are full of the same intensity that it took the Lord of the Rings franchise three films to build up to: There are battles on bridges, parkour assassinations, and more extras than you could shake a stick at. It appears that the director is caught between the knowledge that; whilst there are many comfortable with these ancient stories, a film of this calibre requires an introduction. The product of this mixed and, clearly reluctant, position is that Elsa, and other minor characters, are assassinated before their properly introduced, protagonists are neglected and hidden amongst the melee of the revolt, and villains are introduced with vigour, only to be inexplicably absent from the rest of the film.It seems that whilst Ritchie was editing his first cut, at a length of over three hours, it would have been to the benefit of the film had the introduction been cut from the final reel – Which might have saved some of the more unsettling questions: Why does Vortigern (Law), usurper of his brother, dictatorial King of England, and ultimate villain of the film, cry of have a nosebleed every time he appears on screen in the introduction? Why is Mordred (Knighton), famed nemesis of the Pendragons and magical scourge of Camelot, dispatched within the first five minutes by Uther (Bana) climbing atop his behemoth war elephant? Or why is this introduction completely incongruous to the rest of the film? However, once the cinematic mess of the opening segment is complete, we begin to see some of Ritchie's directorial flair. The film was pitched to him as a cross between Snatch (2000) and The Lord of the Rings (2001), whereas the reality of the film is that it appears as a cross between Aladdin (1992), and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) but set against the backdrop of A Knight's Tale (2001). The viewer is shown in a frenetic montage that, as a result of Vortigern's usurpation of the throne, Arthur (Hunnam) has been smuggled out of Camelot and raised as an orphan on the streets of Londinium, taking the workers of a bordello as his new family and earning money through pick-pocketing tourists and traders whilst learning to fight under the training of George, played by Chinese-British actor Tom Wu.Following a 'heist', involving stealing from the Vikings and the cutting of Greybeard's (Persbrandt) grey beard, Arthur finds himself on the run from the Blacklegs – a military outfit enforcing the King's rule and protecting those under Vortigern's blessing. The early part of this film is dialogue based, but never stagnant or heavy on the stomach as Ritchie's banterous charm introduces the cockney to the East End a few centuries earlier whilst offering a new take on Arthur's story. David Beckham as Trigger Even David Beckham gets a cameo role, portraying one of the Blacklegs, Trigger, in the quarry where Arthur is made to attempt to extract Excalibur before being branded to ease the anxieties of the king. Unaware of his heritage, Arthur pulls the sword out from the stone and loses consciousness from the overwhelming power contained within. The lighthearted tone and comic influence that complements the serious narrative of Ritchie's films soon slips away as Vortigern initiates a smear campaign to discredit Arthur's claim to the throne. The King kills his 'family' from the brothel and publicly demands that he appears before the people of Londinium as a weak and false King. Through fear of losing those he loves, Arthur surrenders to Vortigern's plot and is tied to the block in preparation to be beheaded.The Mage (Bergès-Frisbey) rushes to disrupt his execution in the form of an Eagle familiar, allowing Arthur to escape with Excalibur through the crowd in a scene that would not have appeared out of place in the Assassin's Creed video game franchise. There is some controversy as to why Merlin did not appear in the film, especially as there was a significant to include Mordred, despite of his minor role. It seems likely that 'The Mage' is designed to be the equivalent of Merlin, or perhaps a character to be introduced later in the series of six planned films in this franchise. Considering the steps towards inclusion that Ritchie has taken; portraying Sir George as a Chinese rebel, Sir Bedivere as as West African, and the rest of the Knights of the Round Table as low-born thieves and hustlers, it would not have been a step too far to depict Merlin as a woman.It seems, at times, that Ritchie struggles with the identity of the film between the speed of the films in his discography versus managing a film that is poised to develop into a serial franchise.Read extended reviews like this at 'The Cineaste Review' on WordPress - thecineastereview.wordpress.com",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
446,and-charalambous,King Arthur was good!,7,6 June 2017,"I just watched the movie tonight. I liked it but I don't think it's anything to gag on. HOWEVER, the visuals are amazing, the acting and soundtrack are great and so is the plot. The fight sequences are off the charts, I really liked those. They reminded me of an anime which had amazing fight scenes. So that was good. King Arthur is a massive story originally, written by many people. I liked the references to the Lady of the Lake as well. I would've liked to see Merlin and see what he can do. Maybe WB was aiming for the film's box office success and letting Merlin show up in a sequel. However, I don't think there is a sequel on the way since the movie hasn't even reached its budget yet. Anyway, Jude Law was amazing in his character gave the movie a different tone. What I liked but also didn't like were the scenes where everything is narrated but is happening at the same time. Anyway, I suggest people to go watch it and judge for themselves. Enjoy!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

448,zehra_theReviewer,Best movie about King Arthur so far,9,10 June 2017,"The legend couldn't be told in a more creative and action-packed way. The story-line carries the legend to a vivid, marvelous motion picture presenting the audience many scenes that cannot be imagined only by reading its book. The visualizations and the extra events are very different from the earlier versions of King Arthur movies. Jude Law fits perfectly for the bad role and the movie starts with a very shocking event making the spectators think of the possible next scenes but maybe guessing nothing related to this first scene.Charlie Hunnam is a good choice for the Arthur role. His appearance displays a strength both in the face and the movements, which makes Arthur more likely to be evaluated as a possible hero, king by the audience.In summary, this movie is my advice for the ones who like to see how people sacrifice what they value for the sake of absolute power or how people force themselves to manage a great power. This is also recommended for the ones who prefer to see war in a known historical context with startling fight scenes",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
449,signlady,Guy Ritchie is THE BOMB!,10,1 June 2021,"I loved this movie! Every composition, every word of dialogue, every knowing glance of each character, & just the overall story pulled me right into this medieval world.I appreciated that the sets & actors were filthy and real, and it felt damp & clammy in exactly the right way. The wardrobes followed suit - I liked the way they were slightly modernized & 'funky'. The soundtrack is incredible, & with Ritchie the soundtrack is always spot-on - never dull, rote, or usual.As for some of the low-review comments - I guess some people just can't keep up with a sequence of scenes telling how a part of the story will play out while being juxtaposed against another sequence of scenes showing it playing out - the fact that Ritchie can create this so many times in one movie is stunning.I can't get enough of the action & pace of it. It moves the story along, tells a lot more of the story quickly yet all while drawing you into it more & more.I've enjoyed every thing Ritchie has done - he's just a directorial genius.I SO look forward to the future of Guy Ritchie films!!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
450,shelbylyn-92984,Disappointing,5,16 May 2017,"Let me preface this by saying I like some of guy Ritchie's films. Lock stock and two smoking barrels is great. Sherlock Holmes was gritty and I enjoyed that too for the time period it was set in and the subject matter, his directing style was very fitting. However when you do a King Arthur film I think everyone was expecting it to be more game of thrones lord of the rings esque, in the sense that it would be a traditional badass 13th century medieval portrayal of the legend of King Arthur. Instead that's not at all what the audience was delivered with. Great acting yes but sadly the film was drowned in cgi and plot holes. The beginning I found to be very choppy for this kind of a story. I think this movie once again like many others suffered from the attempt of it being made into a trilogy. I've read that was their plan but with the flop ratings now that might not be possible. Overall I was very disappointed, and I work in the film industry. I'm surprised by the positive reviews on here because it's the only place you'll really see them for this film unfortunately. Honestly it's sad if people condone cheap thrills as serious entertainment, this wasn't a deep film. I would save the money on the ticket for this one.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
451,hristogbalabanov,Not what I expected in a good way.,8,12 May 2017,"I went into the theater expecting a CGI fest and some parts of the movie definitely were.With that said, I liked that the movie broke some of the clichés while outright made fun of others.The main character is not some bumbling farm boy that trips over his own shadow. We are introduced to him, obviously as a child and we are given a quick (maybe two minute) quick shots of his journey into adulthood. It was made in such a way that some will like it, some will hate it, but it was intense, if one could use that word. Also, in the end, when he is an adult that is, we know why he has the skills that he has and are not just told so. The connections he has, the abilities he has developed make sense and we are not just told so and when he finally wields the sword, it is more of a build up upon his existing skills rather than everything been the sword itself.Another parts that I liked is that they gave magic rules. Not like spoken rules that they tell you about, but rules that exist and if you watch, you can see them. For example, the main bad guy only uses fireballs while the good witch only controls animals.The movie approach to the whole case was also different. When Arthur is finally revealed to be the rightful king, those around him don't just go. ""Right, let's attack the castle and take back your crown."" There is almost a smart approach and you can see Arthur slowly taking command. It is not a sudden thing, nor do the others wait for his order the moment they know who he is.The fight scenes were incredible, especially the last but maybe this was the 3D talking, nevertheless, I enjoyed them.Some will complain that the soundtrack did not fit, that if was maybe too modern, but it fit just right, in my opinion.All in all, if you go in with no expectations and don't try to compare it to previous films of the same name, you will enjoy it.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The opening is told in flash forwards which makes you think they are just fast forwarding through the story. Apparently the future King Arthur acquired a cockney accent which seems to be so that it fits with guy richies narrative that every film is set in the east end of London. For some unknown reason Arthur is taught martial arts by a Chinese fighting character. The cutting of the movie is very quick cuts in a very cartoonish matter and it distracts from the whole flow of the movie such as it is. Jude law is just appalling in this. I think he has given up on having any credibility as an actor and is just happy to turn up to pick up the cheque.

455,garethrleyshon,Polished yet lacklustre in places...,7,21 March 2018,"When his father (Eric Bana) is murdered and his uncle (Jude Law) takes power over the kingdom, Arthur (Charlie Hunk-am) looses the life that is rightfully his and is forced to grow up on the streets of the city. But his destiny changes when Arthur is forced to try and pull the fabled sword from the stone... Okay, so. This really won't be for everyone. It hurtles along at breakneck speed, mixing real time narrative with flashbacks/flashforwards (depending on your interpretation) and can most certainly be a tad confusing if you don't give it your undivided attention. Three minutes in and I was wondering the hell I was watching...However, if you have the patience and perseverance it is really rewarding. To begin with, the editing really is wonderful. Not only does it add a modern element to this otherwise historically styled epic, it's fast, inventive and at times very, very funny. Which is of course typical of Guy Richie, who ultimately shows here, he is more than capable of handling big budget epics such as the legend of King Arthur and still retain the style of earlier works such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000). And thankfully we are spared much of the over sentimental 'discovering your destiny' rubbish that one was expecting... Richie does skew the original King Arthur myth somewhat, and adds a much more embellished magical and mythological take on the story. The magical elements are spectacular, the giant wildlife, the mythologic sirens, and scenes of elephantine destruction are incredible. This doesn't mean that the original myth is completely lost thought, it's still there, even if the set up to the pulling of the sword does seem to almost come out of nowhere. Partly what lets the film down is the non magical elements. Some of the CGI fight scenes are disappointingly obvious, and our hero, Charlie Hunk-ams performance does seem a little phoned in and flat. Good job he's pretty. But then there's that awful uneven accent... But, so pretty... Oh, the conflict one feels right now... Anyway, some of the other characterisations also get a little lost in the foray, and when the film ended, I definitely had no idea who some of the charters were or what they added to the plot. And whoever cast David Beckham and his non existent acting skills needs a serious talking to. One of the best performances and characters comes from Jude Law, the villain of the piece, who provides us with some quite nice, if it's possible, inner turmoil over his actions. As engaging baddies go, he's not half bad. BOTTOM LINE: Fast, furious and action packed, let down by some performances that can't be pulled from the stone",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Everything blend in so good that it is officially the best movie I saw all this year and thinking that i was avoiding it for some weeks now.The way it puts the legend, I don't know how much it respects it cos I am not familiar with the King arthur and Excalibur story, is great. Takes you from the beginning, shows from here Arthur comes the strength his nobility his story his quest for the inner strength to fight his inner and outer demons. It reminds me of Game of thrones, the fantasy the action the plots and the royalty thirst of power,how much they are willing to sacrifice, to be dehumanised just to have as much power as they can and control people with fear. But someone stands out and fights helped by a mage and his friends. I read here that it reminds also of Lord of the rings, but I don't think so because Lord is more for kids it is more soft, more likely with Game of thrones as a story line but not as violence.And from now one I will pay more attention at Guy Ritchie movies, cos this one was really great.

It seems like Warner Brothers put Guy Ritchie at the helm but then, even with the success of Sherlock Holmes decided to market it as a big screen Game of Thrones style swords and magic epic. A huge mistake because what it is is Guy Ritchie at his finest. Filled with action, with and the right kind of over the top fun kids of all ages will enjoy. Charlie Hunnam is likable, even charming in this iteration of the Arthurian legend and doesn't seem to take himself any more seriously than he needs to. There were literally 5 people in the theatre including me and my partner but we all loved it.

458,chamarais,king arthur 1- Self discovery,5,4 July 2017,"I went to see this because of Guy Richie I thoroughly enjoyed snatch and lock stock .., because I thought this was underrated. This movie is not underrated. Beginning storytelling was OK, but I did not care at all at what happened to Arthur or other people. The whole time i was waiting for the movie to pick up and was disappointed around middle when i figured this will not pick up at all. Two reasons. 1. the characters are fake. To compare, in snatch when Brad Pitt has that tragedy I was shocked. I felt that pain and disbelief. But here when a somewhat similar scenario occurs here I was like oh.. this a scene I'm supposed to feel sorry. why ? who is this guy dying. Why is this guy ready to die so quickly. At that moment I started to analyze why I did not feel anything. The reason being these characters were fake. They did not act if rational people did in that universe. It's as if these people knew they were in a movie and nothing bad could happen. Only character who 'lived' in this universe is that mage who was genuinely worried that things would not get done. 2. This was a prequel to some Trilogy or universe of movies coming up. And the story will pickup in that movie. Because of that this movie does not go grand. It just focuses a bit on how arthur came to being for the entire movie rather than focus of his adventures. (spoilers ahead) Because the adventures had to be covered in the next movies.Arthur did not want to be arthur for so long that It was like watching hanna baker. Its almost as if after finding he's arthur the writers ran out of story. Nothing of significance happened afterwards. Ask someone the story of what happens after arthur finding hes' arthur and you will see people scratching heads to explain. They could've named this king arthur 1- self discovery for that matter. (one more thing he faints like a little girl every time he grabs his sword, for the majority of the movie if king Arthur touches his sword, he faints. This is a major plot point he was like superman with a sword if he did not faint the movie would've ended which is exactly what happened at the end)",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

There was just a ""Mage"" as a ""leading lady"" and she was quite well chosen.It is a new view of King Arthur as a myth/legend.I would watch it again and definitely purchase it without a doubt. One of the best movies of the year. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
460,shrikar-v,Steaming pile of CGI garbage,5,15 July 2017,"This movie was just so awful, never mind the whole this is not how Arthur should be, this is not how any movie should be. Its just a montage of random CGI scenes that borrow heavily from Game of Thrones and 300 interlaced with some mediocre writing with lines that are delivered like they are clever but really aren't. Most of the action sequences are just incoherent blurs of smoke, fire and loud sounds. The fight choreography is just awful, second only to the laconic performances led by the most unbelievably bad casting mishap - Jude Law, who looked like he may burst into tears any minute. Perhaps the worst part of the movie is how shamelessly Guy Ritchie has stolen from other shows and movies to try and add some flavor to this bland and boring movie, like the casting of little finger from game of thrones, the kung fu master from Marco Polo and Djimon Hounsou, undercover as the only black man in medieval England. Please spare yourself and don't watch this movie.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
461,rfant01,Really - How bad can political correctness get?,1,12 January 2019,"I use to consider First Knight the worst ""Arthurian"" based movie ever. The idiots were running around wearing cloth coats with bits of shiny plastic glued to them, they now have my apologies! At-least they were wearing plastic patches and not Robes, beanies and a modern jacket! Now there's something to go alongside the 300 Greek Hoplites jumping around doing karate kicks in loin cloths. Idiots seem to think that 'creative license' and 'politically correct' gives them the right to vomit out whatever garbage they want to. Hey, Historic news flash - political correctness be damned - NONE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE ROUND TABLE WERE BLACK OR CHINESE, no more than any of the 47 Ronin were white! If you want to do something with a bunch of non-white heroes - that's great, just don't trash existing heroes, when are they going to produce a version of the Revolution where George Washington and Ben Franklin are Black? There is some evidence (as shown In 2004) that these characters were based on real people, and I am quite sure that they would be highly OFFENDED by this garbage. I certainly am. If ""politically correct"" were actually correct then it wouldn't need the word ""politically"" would it? These idiots should quit doing anything remotely concerning history and stick to the made-up fiction they produce anyway..One review said ""Leave your preconceptions at home"" Its says ""king Arthur"" I have the right to certain preconception, like them being English - or at=least European, and wearing some form of armor, not robes and beanies.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
462,QuintLives,Just watch Excalibur instead,2,25 May 2017,"Wow. I don't even know where to start with this trainwreck. King Arthur is one of those classic stories (like Robin Hood or Zorro or Tarzan) that Hollywood likes to dust off every decade or so, spend an ungodly amount of money on it and then promptly regret it. There have been many King Arthur movies over the years, but this one is something special. This movie is hilarious. I laughed so hard that I cried at one point. The problem, of course, is that this isn't a comedy. But I haven't laughed this hard at the movies since Crimson Peak (note: also not a comedy). This adaptation (and I use that term pretty damn loosely) begins with Camelot under siege by the evil wizard Mordred who controls evil elephants the size of skyscrapers (elephants, of course, being native to medieval England). Arthur is a child at this point and witnesses his father's death at the hands of his uncle, who was secretly conspiring with Mordred (I think). Arthur gets away and is brought up in poverty until he eventually pulls the sword from the stone and begins a quest to retake the kingdom. Even if you only have a passing knowledge of the Arthur legend, you may have noticed that I didn't mention a few key characters. Characters like oh, I don't know, freaking Merlin. And Lancelot. And Guenevere. And Morgana. Aside from a brief mention of Merlin, none of them are in this movie. That would be like remaking Star Wars and not mentioning Han Solo, Darth Vader, Princess Leia or the force. Maybe they were saving them for the sequel, which we sure as hell aren't getting. It is one thing to take liberties with a story that has been told a million times. It is another thing to leave out the main characters. Let's talk about the editing in this film. One of my core beliefs with film editing is that the audience should be able to tell what order the scenes should go in. This movie somehow manages to fail that criterion. Scenes are interspliced with preceding scenes so that you are simultaneously watching an action scene and the scene in which the characters are planning what to do in the action scene. Did that sound confusing? Try watching it. I often didn't know if a scene was taking place in the immediate past, present or immediate future or if it was a dream or a hallucination. There is one scene that I still can't figure out when it was supposed to take place. That is an almost stunning failure of basic narrative structure. Additionally, large patches of time are covered in montage sequences. Arthur's entire upbringing and a sequence when he is dropped off on Kong Island to fight monsters to make him stronger (or something) are glossed over in about two minutes of quick-cut scenes. Word around the interwebs is that the film's original cut clocked in at a mighty excessive 3 and ½ hours and their solution to this was to edit entire groups of scenes together into these montages to get the movie down to 2 hours. If you make a 3 and ½ hour fantasy epic, then release that and put an intermission in the middle. Don't butcher it and make me pay full price for a nearly incomprehensible Cliff's Notes version of the damn thing. Also, Excalibur has been upgraded in this film and can now turn Arthur into The Flash. When wielding the sword, he seems to slow down time and can casually mow down dozens of people single- handedly. Why doesn't he just do that all the time, then? Good question. Even in the final battle with the big bad (who looks suspiciously like Shao Kahn from Mortal Kombat), he completely forgets that he could end the fight in 2 seconds. The only conflict or suspense in this film only exist because the hero conveniently forgets that he has super powers. Similarly, he has a female wizard friend (let's call her Not-Merlin) that can control animals. She spends the whole movie controlling birds and dogs and whatnot, until the end when she suddenly summons a snake the size of the freaking Lincoln Tunnel that decimates a room full of bad guys. Dumbass, why didn't you do that in the first place? If I was Arthur, I would ask Not-Merlin why she has been screwing around this whole time when her death serpent could have solved all of this before the opening credits ended. Movie, if you are going to give such powers to your characters, you also have to give reasons why they can't just solve all their problems with such powers. Otherwise, you have failed.This movie is a perfect storm of modern cinematic crap. It's too dark (both literally and figuratively), it's terribly edited, it has awful CGI that reduces every threat to a video game character and it sacrifices character and story in favor of flashy nonsense that insults the audience's intelligence. If you want to watch a King Arthur movie, I highly recommend watching Excalibur from 1981. It's not a perfect film, but it's a hell of a lot better than this pile of crap.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

466,brin-t-murray,Charlie Hunnam has fire in his belly – OWNS this role,10,20 May 2017,"Charlie Hunnam has fire in his belly and brings real passion to this Arthur: add to that terrific natural physical presence, and the ability to convey a softer side of confusion and sensitivity, and he OWNS this role. Best Arthur ever. If you like Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings, you will LOVE this movie – with the slight caveat that the English accents are ordinary not posh, and the humour's sharp, dry and irreverent. King Arthur is a total thrill ride: breakneck action, terrific acting – Jude Law outstanding as conflicted evil uncle, Eric Bana solid as always, the Mage perfect – not textbook Hollywood bland-into-the-crowd, but quirky and intense. The sound track works, from heart-poundingly tense to lyrical and moving. And the cinematography – the sense of this broken world, Londinium after the Romans left and living amongst the ruins – is amazing. Even the weird beasts – and no fan here of fantastical creatures – are breathtaking, their impact maximized by being used sparingly: only available to bad guy after extreme dark magic. There's a satisfying build of tension as Arthur learns how to use the sword, and grows into his new role. His self-doubt and character development are relatable; we really like this Arthur. Plus there are some serious battles. The critic reviews – what are they on? Some complained about a confused narrative buried under too much action: we were surprised to find the narrative is clear, coherent and internally consistent. Not traditional? Get over it: it's a legend, not history. Too much fast cutting? Maybe, for the slow of mind– eg quick cuts when Arthur refuses to meet the Barons – he tells Bedivere how this meeting would go down. It doesn't happen (and is hilarious, BTW, tho suspect would go over the head of non-Brits not tuned in to the total classism of English society, or Guy Ritchie humour). The cuts show Arthur's rationale. None are unnecessary, all are entertaining - and fast. Don't believe the critic reviews – this is a brilliant action fantasy adventure we'll go and see again, soon. Edit: Saw it again, second time round even better!!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
467,TechnicallyNuts,Pure entertainment at it's best,10,29 October 2020,"For all those people who rated this movie poorly you just don't get it. First of all the original story was pure fiction so the argument that this movie doesn't meet those standards is a joke. As far as suspension of disbelief it's a movie that is aimed at being entertaining so that's just not a requirement either. The dialog and wit in this are simply put, pure fun. I'm a fan of a movie that knows how to avoid being drawn out and boring. So many movies attempt to be more art than entertainment which I think misses the whole point when the idea is to make it enjoyable. The style of Guy Ritchie is definitely unmistakable and you can't miss it. That's certainly part of the charm and character as well. The character development isn't supposed to be on par with those so called Academy Award films and is in fact just not needed. If you want to sit and enjoy a film that will keep a nice tempo from start to finish with a lot of clever dialogue you won't be disappointed. So grab some popcorn and a drink, turn down the lights, turn up the volume and kick back because unless you just over analyze the films you watch, I guarantee this will entertain you.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Casting was great. FX were great. Musical score was great. Everything was great thus the 10/10 rating I give it. This is a telling of Arthur to King Arthur and no further than that...yet.

473,troyhoch,Pure Guy Ritchie,2,2 December 2017,"""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" is a new take on the legend of King Arthur, adding as many holes into it as new concepts. It's a film for Guy Ritchie fans and Guy Ritchie fans only. The action sequences bored the living daylights out of me as it did the critics, filled to the brim with horrific CGI. It's endlessly flawed, and there's one scene where Ritchie's trademark quick cuts are so fast that I could not keep up on what was happening, even after re-watching. The script is undeniably thinly written as the special effects are bizarre. It's accuracy is way too far from the old tale, even as it attempts to be a new take on it. What keeps it from falling off the rails is that all actors tried really hard to keep viewers interested, though Ritchie's direction and the terrible dialogue hamper their efforts. ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" did not engage me once in the film, as it was a clear unnecessary remake of the Arthurian legend.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

477,andre-bobrov,One of the best films of 2017,10,5 November 2017,"Probably I'm specific kind of guy who prefer watching fireplace in ultra hd during reading. I am definition audio and high definition video addict. In advance there is no space in my life for silly conversations and films or clips. I was laughing last time watching last Thor ragnarok in 4dx as movie with stupidly created moves of the seats and basically disturbing the enjoyment of scenes, forgiving the teenage orientation scenario. All the technological advantages we do as civilization is to feed our emotional needs and comfort. But there is no way we can achieve this without structure and properly set mood or structure. This is the reason why movies like Star Wars, Mad Max, Baraka and others are so demanded and respected. King Arthur is not a movie to watch, it is great mood to set. To fully understand this, I had to watch movie 3 times to realize how much I like it. Perfect clothing, good actors and one of the best visualization effects in movie makes it impressive. Nonetheless the most important aspect is scenario. Movie is literally keeps you in control, your mind is focused on the way how you flow in scenario. It is difficult to explain how this movie made me happy. Only now I realized the new generation of 3d technology is there and this is the future of film. I must admit I was long time 3d sceptic, and none of the Marvel movies convinced me the opposite. King Arthur however made my mind change at this point. Long story short, one of the best film cuts I've ever seen. One of the greatest sound engineering production ever came out. One of the best soundtracks. One of the most original film. One of the best visual effects of 2017. One of the best 3d depth location and object placement. One of the best directors of all time. Great, legendary story. Organic actions which fully filled my expectations. I thank Guy Richie for this great master piece. I hope more movie makers would learn how to properly work with movies. How to flow in visual ideas with structure and well-set mood. I recommend this movie to all high-end enthusiasts. The only con of this film I consider low quality AD conversion of dabbing in Russian language. It sounded like early 2000's, while other sounds of film had clear definition and high dynamic range. The amount in distortion of voice made a bad impression. Movie studios should take care about dabbing quality more and specify requirements every year to set format. I can't believe voice of the dab sounded so flat over the depth of ambiance. Well, that's me.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Snatch and RocknRolla are two of my favourite films. And anything to do with King Arthur usually gets my vote...I've been hooked ever since seeing Arthur of the Britains with Oliver Tobias as a kid. And John Boormans Excalibur is a masterpiece. However Ritchie was the wrong person to direct this film. His haphazard..all over the place style of directing works fine for gangster films, but this story needed a more linier approach. It's almost like he got over excited and tried to cram 3 or 4 films worth into one film. Flitting from one scene to another and ridiculous montages mean that the film has no depth. It's all style and no substance. Also ....THIS IS NOT A GANGSTER FILM....despite Ritchie's obvious attempts to make it one.There are many many anomalies.... although to be fair Ritchie gets around most of these by setting the whole thing in an indeterminate time. It could be set anywhere from 500 AD to 1200 AD...it's not clear from the architecture or clothing, but im guessing from the Viking involvement that it's some time around 800 to 900 AD. Which even then would still put it centuries before black powder and telescopes were invented.There are apparently 5 or 6 films planned. Will I watch any of them ?

Even though there are many bad reviews on the Internet. Here are proves that King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a great example of a film-craft.The piece works on the principle of contrast, which Guy Richie handles very well. It combines old looking costumes and setting with more modern soundtrack, quick tempo, sophisticated editing. The whole movie has a rhythm. It is far from obvious safe way movie makers often tend to fall back. The editing in time is something to highlight. Creators work chronologically with the wider story but get into time loops with smaller story sequences. The collages of flashbacks and flash forwards are challenging for viewer's attention and keep him entertained. It is often funny in slightly absurd way while using clearly film techniques to create humor. It leaves out all needless sentiment and balances Arthur's character. Luckily, here is no exaggerated romantic line, just a small gentle one, not interrupting the plot. So, why King Arthur again? Let's face it, all movie themes come back to theaters over and over again. The market is crowded. This film encourages to use film techniques in its repletion. On the other hand, it is not the example when technology is all what the film is about. It is balanced and serves its purpose here.

Guy Ritchie did a delightful job in all the dialogue and action sequences. You can really see his personality in the movie. I can't believe what a low rating this got. This movie is on par with Wonder Woman. Way better than the pirates of the Caribbean. I hope they do more of these movies. Such a pleasant movie to watch. Well done guys. Well done.,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
495,jenifersims-39162,The greatest movie EVER,10,3 December 2019,"I wish I could give a higher rating than just 10 on this movie. There are so many epic parts in this movie its hard to name just one. If you're looking for an action packed, sprinkled with humor and a perfect example of King Arthur then this movie is for you. It brings it home and directly to life. I've only had the movie a week and I've already watched it 12 times. Literally. What angers me is if critics would actually LISTEN to what ppl like then maybe we would actually care what they have to say. But I don't and neither does so many others. They've given so many rotten scores on so many good movies that I dont give a rat's behind what they think HOWEVER when they cause productions of sequels to stop bc of their ignorance THEN I care that they keep their wide open TRAP SHUT! They better tread carefully bc I'm not the only one who is angry at their stupidity..and there is one thing that hasn't changed from the past. The people will ALWAYS rise to the top, even if it means taking those that oppose DOWN. Hard.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
496,milleniumlogan,Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 26% and as usual they are full of crap.,9,24 January 2018,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword delivers an action-packed, fun, and original adaptation of a classic story. Unfortunately, the critics wanted something copied and pasted from King Arthur movies of the past. Don't listen to the critics! Here's what I liked about the movie.1.) Jude Law plays an excellent villain. He is power-hungry and will do anything to keep his power. By the end of the movie, you truly hate him which is the mark of a well-done villain.2.) Charlie Hunnam does a great job playing the reluctant hero. He has powers but he doesn't particularly want them. The rebels of England need him desperately to fight for them but he doesn't want any part of it... at least, at first.3.) The occasional humor of the movie is well-timed and adds significantly to the movie. 4.) The action sequences are a lot of fun.5.) The soundtrack is awesome.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is my third favorite movies of 2017. Oh and in case you're wondering, I saw 25 movies in theaters in 2017.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
497,maggimar,Predictable Guy Ritchie...,1,17 May 2017,"OK I'm just gonna say it. This contains ""spoilers"" but honestly.. there just isn't much to spoil in the first place. But here we go...-------------------------------------------------------'First of all lets talk about the first 10 minutes of the movie and the trailer. To be honest i loved the first minutes of the movie but that's just because most of the cool things you see in the trailer happen in the first 10 minutes. The movie starts off by giving you the impression that this movie is gonna have a huge war in it with mystical creatures (in this scenario it was elephants the size of Manhattan skyscrapers) and thousands of soldiers fighting and warlocks and a bunch of cool s#!t like that. But after those first 10 minutes the typical Guy Richie comes in and everything is downhill from there...Now we all know the movies the director is famous for.. snatch, lock stock, Sherlock Holmes. These movies are fast paced with fun dialogue and fantastic storytelling that suits those movies just fine. With this movie it just somehow doesn't fit. When you think about King Arthur u think about noblemen and heroics and fighting for the little man. Now there are some moments in the movie where Arthur shows he cares about someone other than himself and has a chance to me humble but then it gets ruined because Guy Ritchie needs his characters to be funny and ""know it all-y"" (not a word I know but..).Not lets talk about the other characters. After seeing the movie I don't actually know the name of any other character other than Arthur. Because you just didn't give a s#!t. If every character that had been introduced (even though there where practically no introductions for any of them) had been killed at some point in the movie I wouldn't have cared because you never got a chance to get to know them at all. Not that these characters were interesting at all to begin with. Very flat and boring characters. Bad acting and very bat material. Which brings me to the script. The script itself was very bad as well. An example. One of Arthurs friends is laying on the floor in a building. The guys son comes in and pretends to work there. The king puts a knife to the throat of Arthurs friend. Arthur comes in and puts a knife to the throat of one of the soldiers in the kings army. Arthur is standing in the doorway and the kid is there with him. Arthur has a knife to the soldiers throat because the king has a knife to his friends throat. The king then slits his friends throat... and Arthur lets the soldier go? Why? It makes now sense at all. Another thing, every single ""action"" scene in this movie, and there are very few of those, are cut short by editing or just plain and simple very bad directing by Guy Ritchie. The camera angle and everything is just s#!t almost every single time. Everything interesting in this movie is cut short because of s#!tty directing.There is a moment in the movie where Arthur has to go to the shadow lands, or some s#!t like that (i don't remember the name), to... well i don't know why exactly it was but i recall it being about him connecting better to the sword or something. Anyway he goes to she shadow lands and its like a big deal that he is going there because its supposedly very dangerous. He goes there and the director gives us about a minute to see all the amazing creatures Arthur fought, now mind you.. we don't actually see him fighting any of them, he just shows us clips and cuts and then in one minute hes back from the dreadful shadow lands and we saw nothing of it and he is no closer to the sword than he was when he went in there...I can write for another hour but in conclusion the best thing about the movie is Eric Bana and he dies after 5 minutes so...Worst movie iv'e seen of the year.ps. And you can't have a king Arthur film without Merlin.. I mean what is that?",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
498,me-81350,People are way too hung up on the Arthurian Story,9,7 December 2019,"Before I mention the film can I say that most of our knowledge of King Arthur comes from a set of stories call Le Mort D'Arthut writtenby Mallory around 1485 and based on source materials stretching back to the 6th century. Not really wanting to trivialise Mallory's work but it was the Middle Ages version of a super hero - a man battling enemies both natural and supernatural with his sword Excalibur and aided by Merlin the magician.How many times do we read a book and then watch a film made from it and complain that the book was better?I would love to believe that Arthur existed with Excalibur and is waiting to emerge when England needs him most.Now you have this director called Guy Ritchie who has made some great down to earth almost comic films. I adore Snatch and think it's the best work Brad Pitt ever did. He has taken the Arthurian Legends - note I said legends they aren't fact - and created a fantasy film with Giant Elephants and Mage Towers and a Jack the Lad King. I don't wish to spoil it for anyone but Batman, Superman, Spider-Man etc aren't real either and the films don't follow the comics.Enjoy this film for what it is - sheer entertainment - it's not Shakespeare. These people who can't separate the old stories
From the new stories have cost us the chance of seeing where Arthur goes next. Shame on you",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Background music is amazing and spot on with the scenes I'm addicted to movies with great background music.

503,Wazzathekiller,Unspeakable trash,1,20 July 2017,"What is there to say about this movie? Can it even be called a movie? It's more like some poorly made music video or computer game where there's no need for a strong script or acting, just a need for mindless visuals and CGI battles that look like they've been created by some college students that have had a week long bender on various illicit substances.This film has virtually no redeeming qualities. It doesn't matter whether it's a King Arthur movie, whether it sticks to the tradition or not. This movie could be about anything and it would still be rubbish. It might as well be about anything or nothing as that's all your left with. The story line is garbage, the characters and acting are woeful (except maybe Jude Law as others have mentioned), the action is poorly shot and the CGI is some of the worst ever committed to film. I mean it's worse than bad. Whoever came up with those sequences should be barred from the film business for life. The music is at least interesting, some of it works well but other tracks are jarring and seem totally unfitting for the subject matter on the screen.No wonder this film was a box office flop and had the studio cowering in shame. Guy Ritchie has had some decent efforts in the past but this is a travesty. I believe it was supposed to be the first in a long line of King Arthur movies the studio planned to churn out. Let's hope another one never sees the light of day. This is a blight on the movie business and humanity.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
504,Pineapples101,"I'm a cockney, I'm a cockney!",6,23 May 2017,"1st act - awesome FX, great Lord of the Rings type action, good universe set-up etc2nd act - Robin Hood Prince of Cockneys! Overly long, overly cockney, to the point of annoyance! They were literally a pearly coat and a knees up short of turning this into Oliver Twist / Snatch.Plus, while Robert Downey Jr's unlimited charisma helped save Sherlock Holmes from Guy Ritchie overload, Charlie Hunnam ain't got those charisma chops, at all! (Yeah, I know, that don't matter to any of you hetro chicks out there)3rd act - back to Lord of the Rings / Clash of the Titans. A quick stop to let our hero face his demons and go on a vision quest. Then quickly off to the ending... Not really sure what happened there, bad guy had captives, good guys turn up and quickly get the upper hand on the bad guy... lots of CGI, one on one battles, more cockney stuff etc etcJust good old fun, pretty much like Clash / Wrath of the Titans or Hercules with the Rock. You know who's going to live and who's going to die, bad guys are clearly bad, good guys are all lovable rogues and ragamuffins.

505,caidjohnson,"An exciting ride of a movie, and unique take on an old legend.",8,21 September 2019,"Anyone giving a 1 star review to a movie with this much effort it just bitter and jaded.What this movie isn't is another remake of the same sold storytelling used to portray this tale.
Let's face it, this is one of the oldest fables known to western culture, and few directors have taken as much of a risk on telling it in a non traditional fashion as Guy Richi has.The editing can take a bit of getting used to, and it certainly feels like there's a lot of modern culture mixed into the storytelling. The music sounds like a mixture of traditional and modern influence, the characters are complex and ruthless in a way that makes them sinister even in our times. This is something I feel a lot of movies based on ancient times fail to do, portraying people from the past as having simpler minds than those of today. Definitely not the case here.I would say the biggest reason for all the hate for this movie is about the editing, with a mixture of characters planning their next action while we see it happening at the same time.It's a tactic unused enough to throw some people off, but I had no problem keeping up with it.One thing the movie does very well is slow down and speed up in a very unique way, effectively conveying gravity and severity. The music also does a great job of making key scenes feel more significant.All in all, it's an exciting and enjoyable film. Definitely worth the watch.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
506,carina-reyes,Creative approach to the legend. All Hail Guy Ritchie,9,27 May 2017,"""Spoiler alert"". I've seen one too many King Arthur Films and this lands as one of my favorites. I must admit that the approach to keeping this focused on the beginning and only that was refreshing. I found the inclusion of Guy Ritchie's staple ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock and Barrel"" dialogue brilliant. Jude Law's and Charlie Hannam's character portrayal deserve accolades. The All-star supporting cast from GoT stars ""Little Fingers"" and Dijou Desmond took the film to the next level of an adventurous mix of comedy and drama while wrapped in incredible special effects that surrounded King Arthur fantasy legend of magic swords and sorceries. King Arthur was a mix of King Henry V, magical fantasy of Lord of the Kings and cheeky Snatch dialogue in one film demonstrating a unique portrayal of a character that was not exactly pure. He certainly became far more interesting than past King Arthurs. Uncle V, however, played the perfect evil character. I wonder if Jude Law is now moving into his later years as the handsome, aging devil with his more recent embrace of flawed characters always choosing the dark side. He was simply believable especially when he made choices that dug him deeper into the abyss.Highly recommend this if you are open to a different take on the legendary King Arthur. Keep an open mind and you'll be pleasantly entertained.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

509,TeeBoned,Epic Fail,3,31 October 2018,"Oi! What's Guy Ritchie gone and done with King Arfur, then?King Arthur: Legend of the Sword piles mounds of modern action flash on an age-old tale - and wipes out much of what made it a classic story in the first place. Director Guy Ritchie can turn London crime dramas into cinematic lightning, but apply his fast cuts and jagged pacing to the Arthurian legend and you get, well, a brutal, bleedin' mess.I'm no businessman, but plans for a six-film franchise may be optimistic. Optimism is nowhere to be found in Ritchie's movie itself. It is a grim and stupid thing, from one of the world's most successful mediocre filmmakers.To that hallowed list of great expensive follies - ""John Carter,"" ""Ishtar,"" ""Heaven's Gate"" - let us ceremonially add another name: ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.""",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

This movie is all-action, with a plot that rarely drags. Jude Law turns in an awesome performance as the movie's villain while Charlie Hunnam does a decent job as Arthur. I thought it was extremely clever of Ritchie to add heavy fantasy elements to the story of King Arthur, with inspiration being drawn from the Lord of the Rings and 300 movies in particular.

517,sajjadzaidi,Another legend ruined by CGI and bad writing,1,4 July 2017,"I watched this due to be being a fan of the Arthurian legend. The tale is one that inspires love, passion, and the triumph of good over evil. Arthur is venerated as an ideal king who is noble, just, and chivalrous. This movie rolls over all of that and turns him into a comic book superhero.Many of us cringe every time Hollywood takes an adventure story, and forcefully inserts a romantic sub-plot where it doesn't belong. Well this does the complete opposite. Guinevere and the chivalrous Lancelot are nowhere to be found. Female characters are treated as cannon fodder, and barely get any screen time. And the plot seemed like it was conceived by a 10-year old.As for the CGI, if you're a fan of the trend of blending everything into shades of teal, and turning action sequences into a fast, blurry mess, then good for you. They both work well when used sparingly, and in the right context. Not for two whole hours in what is meant to be an inspirational, romantic tale.I'm all for experimenting with a new take on an old tale, but this strips away the best parts of the source material. Furthermore, there is little to no depth to the characters, despite the best efforts of actors such as Jude Law.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
518,eamonnkenny,One of the best fantasy movies I've seen,9,10 July 2019,"After seeing Excalibur and a number of other King Arthur movies I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I saw it totally by accident on a Ferry and kind of enjoyed it with the bad screening. Then I watched it months later at home and realised I'd missed a gem of a movie. Why is this movie so good? And how could it possibly have bombed at the box office. I just don't get it.Here are 10 reasons why this is a great movie:
1. Daniel Pemberton! He is the next John Williams. Between him and Tyler Bates there are no bad themes between them. Giachinno couldn't have pulled off this amazing soundtrack.
2. Guy Ritchie's style like that in Sherlock Holmes is pushed to the limit. Attaching Go Pro's to peoples heads seems like a crazy idea in such an ancient tale but it works, somehow.
3. Jude Law doesn't always get a chance to work at his best. There are many films he is wasted in, but in this movie he is fantastic. The cast is generally very solid with good interactions.
4. The movie has lots of subtle themes that you would miss. This is contrary to the stupid reviews I've seen were it was said to be a shallow movie. Keep an eye on the people around the table in one of the first scenes. Remember their faces and then look out for them later. This critique is unfounded.
5. The movie is really slick with lots of new takes on the Pendragon story.Now for the con's and perhaps why it bombed:
1. English accents... All over the place. Strong accents. I just don't think Americans could understand half of what was said. Especially Beckham and Hunnam!
2. The departure from the original story with a lot of CGI effects and massive elephants in an early scene would turn off die hard King Arthur fans.
3. The stop start typical Guy Ritchie style would not work for some people. For some reason ""A Knight's Tale"" got away with it, but this movie might not for some people.
4. The movie although light and fluffy in some places is very dark in some places. The dungeon scenes including some sort of leviathan could freak out some people, particularly Christians. The sacrifices of the bad guy might have been disturbing for some parents and therefore would not have brought their kids to see the movie.
5. The movie just wasn't advertised at all.Conclusion: This is a moody film, with a very creative story, amazing soundtrack and Guy Ritchie at his best!

First 5 minutes into the movie, I was excited to see what happens next. Then Charlie hunnam enters and ruins it. I had no idea one actors lack of skills could take down an entire movie like this. He fails to make you believe that he isn't trying to pretend to belong to Camelot. He fails to show any emotion, any acting skill and basically renders every scene he is in-boring. By the end of the movie I thought that this actor is the worst choice for this role and probably the reason for the sequels being canned. I have never seen any other Hunnam film and had no idea what kind of an actor he was. For the first 30s I actually thought he was Travis Fimmel; whom I think is a brilliant actor BTW.

I won't dwell on that, as everyone has their own opinion... but 1 out of 10? hogwash. As the opening credits started I got fricking goosebumps when I noticed it was a Guy Ritchie film (good if you are a Ritchie fan), and more serious goosebumps when I discovered the screenplay was co-written by him. I knew this was gonna be a rock and roll adventure- and quite frankly it was. This rendition of the Arthur legend is the best by leaps and bounds. I know films, I study them, I live them, I have given greatly detailed reviews, I pick them apart and am honest in every aspect and I'm no tool. The previous review picks apart everything from actors to character development, poops on them and it's just silly. (And btw- the goof mentioned was just a camera angle that made the sword look single-handed, as Arthur grabbed it mid-way on the handle, then cinched up and added the second hand- idk who writes the goofs, but maybe a second look is needed and edited before it's posted) I can associate with the mage character as I am a mage myself, and being elusive and and mysterious is a mage way. I thought Astrid Bergès-Frisbey character was spot on. Mysterious, vague, and surprising and comfortably subtle (French accent was super sexy too). After all, she was only the guide to Arthurs rise to king and Merlin's apprentice (just an idea, but not based in fact, as the story does not reveal) and as for being bland- meh. Arthur's character development was realistic. As were all the characters. They grew up in a time where the people were oppressed and poverty was a norm, they were controlled by tyrants who were basically all powerful. Arthur was portrayed as medieval ""gangster"" type (classic Ritchie storytelling) who had to prove himself in this selfless world and in turn gains the respect of the common person. This respect allows him to overthrow the evil king and thusforth claim his rightful place on the throne. His ability to control Excaliber only cements that idea. Please, PLEASE ignore the bashing review and watch this film. Especially if you love the Arthur legend and definitely if you are a Ritchie fan. It was a rock and role ride from start to finish and worth watching again. A Guy Ritchie shining star!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
529,daudchris,Guy Ritchie is so genius,9,1 June 2017,"Another commentary for IMDb, i saw this movie 2 weeks ago with my brother in law,At first time i thought this movie will be like the old arthur, or another old classic England stories,but it's notThis movie is so cool, brilliant and awesome in the same time,I like Charlie Hunnam as Arthur, and wanna see him again for another Arthur's movie maybe?i will watch it again, if Bluray version out :)Thanks",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
530,kenhallofficial,Waist of time and money!,1,13 May 2017,"I don't normally trash films but I just gotta say. This King Arther flick sucked Really BAD. I haven't seen a worse film in years!It's a dialogue driven film, but the accents are to thick to be understandable for the films rapid pace! I got lost and couldn't figure out what was happening until almost the third act. The sudo-slow-mo flash back explanations didn't work guys, just a cheesy ""Sherlock Holmes"" rip off. So it's all about undeveloped characters and fantasy structure. Hey screenwriter! Hot tip! When you build a fantasy world, tell the audience the rules! Jude Law kills his wife and daughter and feeds them to an evil fat octopus chick in the moat? Aaaaannnd? Now what? Oh, right he turns into Skeletore with a flaming cape so he can take over the kingdom. But how? Who? When? Why? Vatremin... Vitamin... Villlamin, or whatever his name is, is supposed to be Arther's Uncle, he's next in the line of succession! Why doesn't he just kill Arther as a child and take the sword and be king?! Done! He'd save us the last hour of lousy action cuts and forced acting with little reference to the source material of the Arther legend! (Nice CG recreation of the old crumbling Roman Londinuim between A.D. 400 and 600 though.)Summary: This film was a waste of $17. The CG is good but has no structure! Actors seem to be playing characters from their previous roles --Jude Law is channeling the Young Pope while Charlie Hunnam is doing his best Jax Teller! The first 40 min feels like a BBC movie of the week! I haven't seen worse action editing and shot selection since the 70's.In all, this film has NO story and is horribly directed! TOTAL TRASH! 2017's ""Ben-Hur"" flop! Don't waste the money. 😎👊🏻",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
531,andrewcreer,"Kung Fu, Lord of the Rings, and a tad of..... Goodfellas?",2,19 May 2017,"I went into this movie with fairly low expectations to be honest. I thought it would be an OK movie.... however, this movie wasn't just underwhelming. It was awful.There was a bad taste in my mouth immediately in the opening scene which was directly ripped off from Lord of the Rings. Elephants, a head-to-head bridge battle with two armies running towards each other, and I swear to you - almost the exact same LOTR music for the approaching evil army loaded on the backs of elephants. I still gave the film a chance, but it quickly moved to a montage of Arthur's childhood, which was a succession of shots of him being repeatedly hit in the face. Great character development there. Quickly after, he and his buddies have a whole mobster deal going where they run the town. Oh - and he is trained in Kung Fu by a Chinese man who just happens to live in England during the Dark Ages. Go figure. Shortly after that the plot sort of develops..... in very sloppy fashion, and is finished off poorly and it quickly all crashes together. What this film really lacks is anything original. I feel like I've seen this movie before, just in parts of fifteen other movies (not to mention movies that are all completely different genres). It came together as a cluster of different film clichés, in Guy Ritchie style of course. There are so many things that I could say, including the various plot holes and the complete face palm of some of the logic in the plot itself. Overall, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. I would pass on this one, unless you want to see different montages of screaming, fight scenes that you cannot follow, and more screaming.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
532,samvannuys,Deserves A Second Viewing,8,15 May 2017,"This is the first film I left the theater uncertain how I felt about it... Naturally, I returned for another viewing, and I don't regret it at all! The film itself is lovely, complete with good writing, great camera work, witty dialogue, and much more. However, the film first left me underwhelmed. I didn't dislike it, but I didn't like it either. And I felt some scene's were either too long, or completely unnecessary. it was kind of a ""meh"" film.But as I said, I saw it again, and everything clicked into place, scene's flowed better, characters more developed, and the plot vastly improved. For some reason, knowing what happens allows you to view everything in a different light, the entirety of the film changes and becomes vastly superior.However, if you want to see it only once, you need to know it's meant to tell the story of Arthur's becoming king and overcoming the demons of his past. The events in the film and sub-plots are only a medium for us to take this journey with him.Overall, it doesn't bring anything new to the cinematic experience, but it doesn't need to. It's a well-done film that demands you to see it twice to fully enjoy it. Yeah, there's some bad acting and bad editing at parts, but that's easily overlooked. And when a plot is so under wraps that hints stare you in the face throughout without you realizing until that second viewing, this film is by far one of my favorites. Not to mention the opening 15 minutes are absolutely phenomenal.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
533,guslatho,Good flick,8,13 August 2017,"All around - fun movie to watch.The good - flashy montages, lot of neat editing that keeps the pace nice and tight. Some really cool visuals, the specifics of which I won't spoil, but there's definitely a lot more to see than you're average CGI dragons. Also, the chemistry between the cast is good and Charlie Hunham adds just the right amount of bad-ass to the lead role. You'll also find some GoT favorites if you're a fan of that show.The bad - the editing is kind of messy at parts. Some of the scenes went fast enough that it was hard to keep track of exactly what was happening. There's also the odd few times in which a scene almost appears to be missing because people are suddenly somewhere else.I've never read the original King Arthur, so I can't compare it to it source material, but if you're wanting for a cool fun fantasy flick with neat editing KALotS will probably be a good experience.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
534,cam-88268,"Yeah, just don't call it King Arthur, cause it has nothing to do with the legend",3,25 August 2017,"From the start it was confusing, I had no idea what it had to do with King Arthur, when or where it was supposed to be set, and why the freakin elephants looked like they came out of LOTR except the size of mountains. Then there was the editing, playing two scenes at once, no idea if it was a flashback, flash forward, alternate reality, or what... Costuming, architecture and speech didn't belong in any one time period, so once I figured out it was nothing more than a fantasy and had nothing to do with the King Arthur legend, I figured I could start enjoying the movie... but nup... it was rubbish. Were there scenes cut? What started as some interesting fantasy plot was just predictable and unintelligent, there seemed to be conflict between the main characters that just didn't make sense and introduced fantasy creatures that are never seen again. It just seemed they were trying to ride on the back of Game of Thrones and LOTR, and it just didn't work. Terrible editing, terrible storyline, terrible tentative link to a legendary story mixed with this trend to make the hero dark and flawed. Best I can say is the action was mildly entertaining if you just don't want to too challenged intellectually in a movie.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

536,MsDame,Action blockbuster in need of a soul,6,10 May 2017,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a white-hot, whirly-swirly, entertaining mess. It looks like what it is: too much material accumulated over a long time, shoved into just over two hours. It's frantic to encompass favorite shots and lines and tons of manic video game style graphics (including driving music straight out of a gamer's speakers), while managing to be light on plot and character.Beyond the classic Arthur lore, Ritchie taps Hamlet, Robin Hood, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and even a little Jedi mind trickery, resulting in a mash of familiar fantasy tropes that makes using traditional Arthurian references like ""Excalibur"" and ""Camelot"" feel strangely out of place. Similar to his ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies, Ritchie has gone so far afield from the original mythology that he might have benefited from separating his movie from the source material by letting the parallels to King Arthur play as subtext and naming his hero Max or Bubba instead.The story is of an orphaned boy prince who discovers as a man the truth of being cheated of his birthright by an evil uncle and then seeking revenge. There are a slew of supporting characters we never learn much about beyond their abilities to fight, conjure gigantic animals, or run. Their do or die determination to see Arthur reclaim his kingdom is not fleshed out in a way that supports an emotional connection. Punches are thrown, arrows shot, and swords swung. You root for the good guys, but you never learn to love them. The one scene of exposition bogs the frenetic flow, so it's no wonder Ritchie didn't do more to create a cohesive picture of the where and why of alliances. What's left is hollow action.However, if depth-less, churning entertainment is the goal, the movie delivers. Charlie Hunnam is pretty to look at, with hints of charm. Jude Law tries hard to seem demonic. The supporting characters have interesting faces we wish were supported with internal lives. There's a good deal of humor, so lightly rooted in character it often plays more as one-liners, but chuckle worthy. The non-CGI footage is gorgeous, especially scenery in desolate hills and forests. The effects are pretty good, mimicking the best of video game imagery, but nothing innovative. With so much flashing by in jittery hand-held shots and jarring edits, the 3D is ultimately an added distraction to trying to find content.Action: B+, Heart and soul: D, Entertainment head-buzz: B",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

So I am hooked by that, and I am hooked with fascination of watching this expensive mess.There is such arrogance and ego without insight or wisdom in the making or unmaking of this film. Without true connection with Spirit, nor humility to Faith or True powers.The story is not made with a creative difference like King Arthur (Clive Owen version), but a drunken, macho, mucking, deaf and blind, mess. A lot of expensive, excellent technical craft, attempts to portray Strum und Drang but results are both incoherent and video game empty.If the casting and acting directing and acting editing had been done well, it might have survived. There are excellent actors in some secondary roles, but the 3 of 4 main leads, along with some of the other secondaries, are inadequate to the task along with Ritchie the director. Hunnam and Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey are not bad actors, they cannot command the big screen, and just do not have the ability to be of gravitas or status (like 'good' Shakespeare or Stanislavski/Chekov, or others fine actors learn as important part of their craft: Ie, Helen Mirren, or.

Its his own take on the popular Arthurian legends focusing on character, a single continuous plot line/origin story (without any cheesy romantic fillers), great soundtrack, production quality and ensemble.I definitely hope to re-watch this and hope it gets a sequel or two in time.

No work of storytelling will live upto their exacting standards. Wonder what they would accomplish in their theatre of misery (A sad story where everyone kills themselves I assume!!!).This movie is for the cheerful at heart who want to have a good time at the movies.Ignore the melancholics brooding over with impossible standards of perfection.

I was expecting a frenetic, dimly lit, over-caffeinated, quick cut mess of a movie with little plot, no characterization, and no respect for the subject or history.

The banter is brilliant and the acting is on point. I didn't like the Mage much but she wasn't in it much. Loved the comedic side of it aswell as the seriousness of it all. It might be a different version of King Arthur that we are used to but it was a delight to get a different spin on it. I loved the scenery ..the wardrobe...Charlie Hunnam..and how.it made me smile. I know it won't meet some people's taste but each to their own. The story is brilliantly told and Guy Ritchie did a great job in fairness to him. Even David Beckham did good in his 5 min appearance.

557,yepstein,Almost Lord Of The Rings,9,2 June 2017,"Why the Hell did this movie not get good reviews? Luckily, I'm smart enough to read IMDb before I decided whether or not to watch. IMDb reviewers never fail to give the correct rating. By almost Lord Of The Rings, I mean that the movie played the large scale fantasy perfectly, except unlike LOTR, it didn't build a whole world. It didn't generate a sense of journey. Instead the movie focused on building character, and a much more interesting cinematographic style. Which isn't necessarily worse or better. It just gave the movie its own flavor. The writing is refreshingly ""clicheless"". There were obviously a few cliché, but not as much as you'd think. As well as that, the dialogue was not only interesting, but I found myself laughing out loud at times. Movie managed to be hilarious and very serious at the same time. Another reason this was almost LOTR, was because the music wasn't as masterfully crafted specifically for the movie. However the music, as well as the rest of the sound, is phenomenal, and whereas most movie's music compliment the picture, King Arthur's music enhanced the movie tenfold. Lastly, what most people are probably wondering. The CGI was perfectly believable, and the texture of everything felt real. Beautiful camera angles. The only reason I gave it one star less, is because a couple shots in there made no sense, and kind of broke the reality, plus a couple more shots in which the CGI wasn't done well. This movie deserves an award.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

None of which really matters, they could just have made a movie about a lost chosen prince and a legendary sword.

It is gritty, baron, wild, very arty and a film I will return to many times. Love the way he uses ARTHUR to explain dialogue... there are specific scenes that stand out, and will last in my mind along time... I think it will be one of my favourite films on my shelf when I buy it later.

I had not heard of the lead actor playing Arthur and look forward to seeing him in future films. Jude Law was excellent! The legend of Kind Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table give rise to those who tell his story the ability to take liberties in doing so.

561,alanahsurfchick,King Arthur comes to life.,7,18 May 2017,"Witness the origin story of the legendary King Arthur in this epic Guy Ritchie film. Raised on the streets following the murder of his parents, the young Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) is oblivious to his royal heritage. That is until he pulls the mighty sword Excalibur from the stone. Arthur must now battle against the evil king, Vortigern (Jude Law), to reclaim his birthright and free England from his tyrannical rule. Now the film does take some liberties with the actual Arthurian legend and don't expect to see characters like Guinevere, Lancelot or even Merlin in this film. There are the occasional nods to other aspects of the legend here and there, but primarily the film is concerned with telling its own story. We do have the pleasure of watching the actions of the Mage (Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey), a powerful sorcerer who helps Arthur in his quest. Charlie Hunnam is brilliant as Arthur, managing a delicious cocktail of cockiness and vulnerability. He also has a good amount of witty dialogue with other characters, such as the men who will become the Knights of the Round Table. Hunnam really carries this film and is a large part of the reason why it is so enjoyable. Jude Law's Vortigern was also a good villain, being menacing without being over-the-top. The rest of the supporting characters are so-so and are mainly there so Arthur has someone to engage in witty dialogue with. The story, while not overly compelling, is a fun ride and, aesthetically the film looks awesome. Overall, this film was an adventure and more enjoyable than what critics would lead you to believe. It has a strong lead character and there are quite a few entertaining moments. If you go see it in cinemas, you're sure to have a fun time.

563,peterfessier,Guy Richie Fan,2,5 January 2018,"I like Guy Richie movies like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. I get what he's trying to do here with this movies, putting his standard lovable English Mob characters into old England. Sometimes that kind of thing works but here it doesn't. I like the dialogue in Guy Richie movies, I think that's the best part and the slo mo stuff he does. If he'd kept to that and been consistent, kept it smaller maybe it could work for people like me who just like his movies and and willing to give him a lot of artistic license to have fun. However, where he really goes wrong, what makes this movie truly awful is the CGI. Everything looks fake and and it's all too bombastic with explosions and giant elephants. He's trying to do a big epic movie and I'd say he just doesn't really know how to do one yet. It's ugly to look at and basically boring and pretty damn dumb. It also kind of reminds me of one of those movies I used to see as a kid where I wondered why even though the movie is set in the past everyone is sporting contemporary hair styles. It just seems kind of lazy. I think Guy Richie was thinking of a sequel when he made this. On the good side this would be one case where it would be easy for the sequel to be better than the original. On the bad side, he shouldn't have made this movie in the first place.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
564,NCC1705,Outstanding,10,17 May 2019,"Probably the most underrated movie in cinema in recent years. And an outstanding box office failure.
I don't understand what people like or don't like. Yes, the fantasy narrative has been all but destroyed with cheap (or even expensive), medieval soap operas. Predictable, linear. And yes, anything CGI loaded doesn't have much to show any more, no matter how well they are done. We have grown indifferent.
I looked at the posters, I looked at the trailers, terribly underwhelming. Commoners dressed in rags, covered in mud, fighting evil, dragons, fat smelly witches or whatever. I said I will watch it, but maybe later, there were other, more appealing titles. They failed to make a point.
Because Guy Ritchie doesn't fit in a trailer. Imagine a Snatch trailer, way back then. What do you have to show, what's so interesting or spectacular about it? Absolutely nothing. Bunch of thugs with delusions of eloquence. And yet it was pure gold.

But instead I was surprised to find that Guy Ritchie has applied to King Arthur the same style and technique that made his Sherlock Holmes films so beloved.In this film is the witty dialogue and creative editing we've (at least some of us) have come to love from Guy Ritchie. There was never a boring scene throughout. The action is good, the effects are good, but it is the manner of delivery of it all that brings this to greatness.The acting is solid, some characters are less developed than others but I did not feel that this hurt the movie at all. I've seen King Arthur movies before but have never seen it told in this manner, it is to King Arthur what Batman Begins was to Batman.Should you see it? If you did not enjoy Guy Ritchie's other works, especially the Sherlock Holmes films then you may have issues with his style, but if you were entertained by any of his other films then there should be no reason for you to not be entertained here also.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

576,gillian-felix,A Non-Critic Review of King Arthur,7,14 May 2017,"I can usually tell if I would like a movie from the opening scene. King Arthur: Legend of The Sword had me from the jump. I felt that the story was really well told, the characters were interesting and easy to care about. It was a story that had a lot of heart.Jude Law's Vortigern was an excellent bad guy! He had all the qualities; devilishly handsome, witty and power-hungry.Charlie Hunnam's King Arthur was cunning, likable and funny. Who knew! He was cheeky but that played well considering that the movie did not take itself too seriously. I mean come on, they were wearing beanies, and Vortigern was seriously styling in a white button-down soft shirt and black slacks. Those tiny details could have taken me out of the time period but it didn't.The graphics felt kind of like a video game, my sister thought, and I'd have to agree.I usually don't get into mythological stories because they tend to lag on and I get bored or I don't know what the hell is going on. But the storytelling in King Arthur was pretty good. What really got me was the ending sequence when Arthur comes face- to-face with his demon (Uncle Vortigern).This struck me as a metaphor for life. When you go through all the hard and unfair stuff you get back up and you fight. In the end, you have battle scars, not to be ashamed of but to be proud of, to be embraced and when you look at them, you know that you've survived some deep stuff and you are stronger for it.The movie had a shooting style like Snatch (2000) by Ritchie, but I'm thinking that's his style. Like Michael Bay movies always has big explosions or John Woo uses doves.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

579,dantehr,Leave fantasy to The LOTR team,4,20 May 2017,"Guy Richie seems to lack the ability to make fantasy plausible. The movie feels like a teenager cut together clips from Lord of the Rings and a few Guy Richie films, but somehow in the process lost the qualities of both. The best moments come from Jude Law musing about the power of fear, and other minor actors split second contributions.The visual effects were mixed ranging from the ridiculously designed Camelot, with no focal points and obvious texture repetitions like an early playstaion game, to the fairly decent Londinium with interesting post Roman elements.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

581,goncalo-fidalgo,"A Very Good Fantasy Flick , Forget The Critics, Go Watch It",7,20 May 2017,"King Arthur: Legend of the sword was directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Charlie Hunnam and Jude Law in the lead roles and is the first entry in the ""Franchise"" Guy Ritchie wants to explore about King Arthur. Entering this film, I was going with a split mind. Critics did not like the film, but the audience liked it. However I entered with an open mind. It is a good movie, fast paced, much like Guy Ritchie that manages to surpass his last film ""The Man From Uncle"". Charlie Hunnam was fantastic in this movie, was the best King Arthur Possible, showed how much he engaged in the character, how much he worked and is rewarded, an excellent interpretation. Jude Law also fantastic with the Vortigen villain . Although the film resides quite a bit in CGI, some good, by the way, the good majority, some mediocre, human history, and the one that truly explores the legend is captivating and challenging, never coming out of the frenetic way of the Director. My only problem with the film is undoubtedly some characters being underdeveloped and uninteresting and that after some time the formula of Guy Ritchie begins to tire a little. King Arthur is a great fantasy and adventure film, surpassing in all the previous fantasy films like ""The Great Wall"" that was lousy. In this, there is a good attempt, there is a good movie ... that entertained me throughout its duration, as a final note I give 7.5 / 10 - 8/10 - Pretty Good",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The cast are right for this film and Charlie Hunnam plays Arthur brilliantly.

The only reason I watched the whole thing, was because there is so little else to do on a long airplane ride.This wasn't a movie, it was one long video-game trailer. The story was told so poorly, it was virtually impossible to keep track of the plot. The sword fights were all wild-CGI melees, with a whole bunch of ridiculous magic thrown in, including swirling aggressive birds (a motif shamelessly stolen from Hitchcock's classic) that in fact didn't really do anything. Jude Law, an actor I respect intensely, should have fired his agent for putting him in this one; it does his uvre no justice. There was no explanation of the role of the woman magician, and the evil serpent women in the castle basement were simply silly.If you have a chance to rent this movie, don't.

If you like stubborn, strong, handsome male lead roles that often get themselves into danger, this movie is for you. ;-)Again, I'm going off of memory, but if I remember correctly, there were some parts I wasn't a huge fan of. One being; They showed you certain things that you should've been able to connect the dots with. Maybe they had to because some people couldn't, who knows. I also remember not being the biggest fan on the final battle scene, but hey, that's my opinion.It's only, what, two hours? So either way, might as well give it a shot. Enjoy!(PS.

He deserves more and I don't know what's gotten to warner bros but their marketing for this sucks! BIG TIME!! They released it the week before guardians of the galaxy! Are you kidding me? What king arthur has that it could compete with a superhero movie? King Arthur is not a big name for big screens and yet they had the guts to compete it with GOTG? Did they expect they will have 200 millions in 1 week? Delusional. So anyway, this movie is sooooo awesome! If I had known it was Guy Ritchie's film I would have watch it in theater. Again it was refreshing to see another different origin story about king arthur and his sword. What I love about this movie is its very modern and stylish film. I don't know why some movies didn't feel like its modern era and with the technologies now, some movies feels old with visuals great visuals. Moving on, the film has a modern vibe that you'll love as a movie enthusiast. How they execute the scene, guy ritchie took a different way to make a history sci-fi movie. The soundtrack was awesome too, daniel pemberton should work with superhero or thriller movies. And the editing was cool too, its very rare to have that kind of creative editing these days.

A True English Cultural Experience,10,27 May 2017,"Looking back through all the reviews on this film, and having seen it myself I can say that this film was attacked by the Critics for no good reason. The first 5 pages of reviews are pure BS. There's no way this got booed at any Cinema. Just straight up lies as far as I'm concerned.For what it's trying to be it's a near perfect film.What it is is an action flick based on one of the all time classic tales.All the elements are their as far as masculinity and femininity being in their natural places, with the mythology surrounding that working perfectly.The humor is great. Dry and sharp, just they way I love it. And the action sequences are awe inspiring.Great acting, great script, classic Guy Ritchie movie. I'll watch this an often as I watch his other cockney classics, LockStock, Snatch and RocknRoller. Over and over again.His movies are like a great song. You can't just watch them once and move on. You are into them for life.The fact that more people didn't get a chance to see this in the cinemas is a crime IMO.

593,paranoso,Missed Opportunity,6,21 February 2021,"Although I enjoyed some aspects of the film, I firmly believe it was a missed opportunity. There is a certain level of responsibility involved when a film maker is bestowed with such a stellar cast. The film dialogue, editing style, and character development, must be
carefully considered. I don't think they put much consideration before embarking on this film.
There are certain film techniques that historically just don't work with this type of story. One of them is fast-editing and interspersing different timelines in hopes of telling an extended epic adventure within three minutes of screen time.
For this film's fantasy genre, and adaptation of a already classic film/story, a more detailed and subtle approach would have made this film much higher praise. When you have highly skilled actors and actresses let them perform. Give us time to soak in the mise en scène, learn about each character, and the time to understand and process the story.The overuse and poor application of CGI is another fail with this film. How is it possible that film directors don't understand that the poor use, and over abuse of CGI takes the imagination out of the film's creatively constructed world? Film makers please remember that less is more, and that the mind can easily notice trickery. One of the things that makes the most timeless films is the film's ability to make us imagine we are really there, that the mise en scène is a real world that we as viewers have the pleasure of visiting. For example, doesn't everyone want to be a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry?",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
594,KvDavid,worst movie of 2017 ( or ever),1,4 February 2018,"I'm not competent in Arthurian legends and other productions, but i'm certain that this interpretation was fail in every point.So the tiny positive aspects were a few musics which were decently used in certain situations, but that is insignificant compared to plot and characters.So the plot starts with the war. unexplored conflict with minimal details and plenty of awful CG takes us to the world of medieval fantasy that is out of tone, because every magical weapon, mystical creature or the magic itself serves as a plot device, helping out the characters in critical situations. The story rapidly moves to the betrayal and then the focus is on our protagonist, Arthur, who was brought up in the brothel as a fuc*boy. While bullying the vikings and collecting money, he was forced to go to the capital and move the mythical sword - Excalibur (which is terribly used plot device). so after succeeding, he was captured by the king, who has been looking for him for decades and for some illogical reason, doesn't kill him. stupidly rescued Arthur later appears to be a great strategist and one-man-army archetype. the last battle was awful, considering the failed choreography and terrible CG , with random power ups. So the story is literally about good vs evil , having no interesting moral and concept.the characters are flat, not interesting, one-dimensional and etc. we basically don't care if they die, because their personalities are unclear, their motives are are either generic or not shown throughout the movie, so they only serve as plot devices. The protagonist is, as i mentioned before, typical fu*kboy , with no personal goals in life. his every action in the movie was influenced by someone, means that he never did something by himself : he was not moving the plot forward, but the opposite. The antagonist was i'm-the-evil-guy villain with no interesting traits in particular. His personality is often defined by his emotional reaction towards dead daughter and wife ( he killed them both for the power, which i have no idea why he needs) but that doesn't mean anything, does it? he has no motives , no goals, he is unralatable and one-dimensional.so before airing, the movie was +- 3 hours long, but it was cut to 2 hours or so. while saying that, if we cut 1 more hour , the movie wouldn't suffer any particular loss. Means that there were several moments that had no significance and didn't move the plot forward in any way. For instance , the dark island or whatever episode, where Arthur was ""training"" , but returned unchanged, so what was the point of this scene? He was still stubborn, still standing on the same idea , but hey, we wasted about 15 minutes watching nonsense. There were more of them, but too lazy to write them all down.The cast was normal, even though there was no need of exceptional acting skills for these stupid and one-dimensional characters.so the movie was the mix of dark tone with terrible CGI and atmosphere that reduces threat throughout the movie, Though the sacrifice of the certain characters that had no buildup made it even worse.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Every actor performed as you would expect, you would love or respect the man that is on the screen or you would hate him like you will hate Jude Law in this movie. Has that ""Sherlock Holmes London"" vibe that sticks on you, beautiful.In my opinion, this movie has some flaws. The second part of the movie is kind of rubbish. The fighting that goes on on the screen in the start just becomes fantasy sword wielding and it lacked realism ( movie about wizards with giant snakes, and I complain about realism). It lacked that little spark that would make you connected to the main character on the screen, that one thing that could make you the king Arthur you wanted to be as a kid.It is a must watch for and fiction and Arthurian legends fan, don't let the critics fool you.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
597,wouterdrummen,"Not as bad as critics say it is, but also not as good as I hoped it would be",6,24 May 2017,"Guy Ritchie has made quite a few entertaining movies, all of which I more or less like; the classics ''Snatch'', ''Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' and ''Rock and Rolla'' have turned him into a famous director, known for his trademarks, like the fast paced action scenes, the scene-less dialogues with a dark but always most entertaining story. I consider his movies from the 90s, without any doubt, to be amongst his best works, although I enjoyed the two ''Sherlock Holmes'' movies and the universe he created around the most famous fictional detective of all time. Now he tries to give another fresh spin to an old story, namely that of the legendary King Arthur. Too bad this time it just didn't work outLet me start by saying that it isn't as bad as many critics make you believe it is. For instance, the movie doesn't even score 30 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, whereas the audience gives it a score of almost 80 percent. So where did it go wrong, and why is it such a box-office failure? First of all, I believe the fact that the release date was changed several times didn't do the movie much good, even its title was changed during the process. The buzz and popularity surrounding the movie were therefore partly lost due to this delay and the title change. Furthermore, I think it can be nice giving a modern twist to old stories, as was the case for Ritchie's ''Sherlock Holmes'' (and even the popular series 'Sherlock') which, to my opinion, worked out really well in both cases. But most of the time it just doesn't. Have a look at the 2016 remake of the famous 11 Academy Award winning ''Ben-Hur''; even with big names such as Morgan Freeman the movie didn't do well. The same happened to the 2016 movie ''The Legend of Tarzan'', which also starred many famous actors such as Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Waltz and Margot Robbie. Maybe it can best be compared with the ''King Arthur'' of 2004, with again, a star-studded cast. The movie didn't do that well; neither at the box-office nor with the critics, who saw it as action packed movie which didn't respect any of the historical aspects. ''The Legend of The Sword'' seems to make the same mistake. I don't have anything against renewing an old story, giving a modern twist to it. After all, it is only loosely based on the Arthurian legends. But the movie just makes too many mistakesThe biggest stars of the movie are convincing and play well; Charlie Hunnam seems to really enjoy himself as Arthur and Jude Law as the villain and an evil king is pretty convincing too. Sadly, that's about it. The other characters have no real depth and we don't know why they are doing what they are doing. They seem mere plot devices with little motivation, as main characters such as Frisbey's Marge, Merlin's apprentice (Merlin, by the way, only gets a name check), Hounsou's Bedivere and Wu's George (even if I applaud the diversity) are shallow, uninteresting and used only to fill the gaps and help Arthur along on his quest. The few main characters that die also have little impact if any at all, and the next scene one already forgets they existed. I tried to care about them, but simply couldn't; Arthur is nearly untouchable, as is the case in almost any 'hero's journey', something we are all too familiar with. We already know the hero is going to succeed, so few surprises there, while the other characters are underwritten and therefore we cannot care for them as much as we would like to.All in all the movie was enjoyable and was visually entertaining and I must say that some scenes were pretty well done, mainly thanks to the use of soundtracks such as ''Growing Up Londinium'' by Daniel Pemberton, which perfectly fits with this style of film. I'm not very enthusiastic about the film; this is not due to the fact that it 'forgets' to focus on many of the Arthurian legends, but especially because it is just a bit too much: the rapid time shifts, the CGI fights, rushing us from one scene to another, going from point A to B without any big surprises. There are also several incomprehensible mistakes (for instance, why does Vortigern never kill Arthur although he has several opportunities to do so?!) It all becomes too messy and incoherent. Popcorn entertainment at its best, but narrative-wise far from good and definitely not worth a 6 movie long franchise like it was intended to be...",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Because of the rushed style It felt more like a TV show at parts and there were too many montages but I would like to see more of this world. Rounded up score cause I would like to see a sequel and some of the reviews are too harsh in my opinion.,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
601,totoj,Good Film/Critics are wrong about King Arthur,8,25 May 2017,"(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS?)Good film, the humour was the best! Many funny moments, that made the film feel really good and entertaining. The dialogue for the jokes were well thought out and added spice and flavor to the film. Charlie Hunnam was in incredible shape! Which made the character, who was already cocky and strong, look even more bad ass! The film score was well written to fit in with the era of the film, the mood of each scenes. There was a memorable theme for the character, which adds a good (bad ass) vibe to Arthur. Love the fact that the director didn't waste too much time on telling the story of Arthur growing up. Love that quick, detailed and cleared section of what a portion of his life was like, instead of spending the 25%-50% of the movie on it. That being said, the movie probably had enough content to make a trilogy, instead of one movie. For example: One movie on his Childhood/Training for his return. Second on getting the Kingdom back. The third one on whatever the sequel to this actual film could have been. Since some points of the film did feel a bit rushed. Maybe that was intentional. If it was, it worked quite well. Would've loved to see more fights, that's not just used special effects, since it's an action movie after all. Would have been pretty cool to see Arthur go completely wild from what he learned from his Kung Fu Master. Not sure why there isn't more hype for this film. Maybe this new interpretation by Guy Ritchie is before it's time. Like when the great inventors back in the day tried to invent new things and everyone thought they were crazy. Maybe, this kind of interpretation is too soon, or not for the right generation, or people just don't like something different and just want to stick to something a bit more familiar. Or people's wants and expectations were different. I personally loved it! It wasn't what I was expecting, but there were many points in the film I couldn't help but just smile because it was very good! See and judge for yourself.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
602,Roger-Shallot,Forget the Legend...,5,5 June 2017,"Anybody hoping for a traditional re-telling of the King Arthur legend is in for a disappointment - this is a 'blockbuster' film using a vague Arthurian theme.There's nothing at all wrong with that idea but Guy Ritchie's film is hampered by some very uneven performances. As Arthur, Charlie Hunman never seems quite convincing, wavering between noble and a not-quite-right cockney geezer. The weakness is highlighted by very competent turns from Jude Law and Eric Bana on one hand and those who do 'geezer' a bit better, such as Neil Maskell and Geoff Bell - both good value as always.Then there's the ladies, none of whom manage to muster a convincing showing. Mostly they're a little bland but as the Mage Astrid Bergès-Frisbey fails to engage at all. Maybe it's the fault of the direction but I've rarely come across such a dull performance in what could have been a very memorable role. It's a shame as there's a fair amount of heart about this film - some funny moments, a little bit of genuine poignancy and some scenes that work very well.Some good ideas but it's neither a compelling working of the legend nor as smart as the writers probably thought it would be.A lot of people love the film and I can understand that but I can also see why it's bombed so badly at the box office. The definitive 'Arthur' film is still to be made (and to be fair, this one probably never intended to be that) but with 'Sharpe' and the 'Last Kingdom' under his belt I don't understand why nobody has brought an adaptation of Bernard Cornwell's version to our screens. A brave stab but 'Legend of the Sword' never cuts the mustard.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
603,creativelefty,Decent Arthurian movie but main actor falls way short,6,27 June 2017,"This was a decent fantasy movie at best, with the usual surplus of Hollywood cgi effects. Not sure Ritchie's style of comical drama story-telling worked here as it felt like even the actors didn't know what they were supposed to be feeling half the time. Biggest gripe is that the movie fell short in casting Charlie Hunnam as king Arthur, he was simply horrendous. I thought Charlie did a great job as a biker 'king' in SOA (sons of Anarchy), but as Arthur, he simply falls way way short. He does appear to be a good actor but in this movie it was as if he brought over his SOA character without changing a thing. Even the way his Arthur character walked was identical to the i'm so cool, show-offy gangsta shuffle he does in SOA. And let's not get started at his terrible attempt at an English accent. To sum up, story-wise this movie is not an overly creative or innovative twist on the Arthurian myth. Acting is overall decent, Jude Law wasn't bad, except for Arthur. All in all, the movie is worth a watch if you can enjoy it purely for the special effects and background sets.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
604,bootoir,yikes,1,5 August 2017,"Worst movie I have seen in years, it was so bad that I stopped watching the last 10 minutes of it, I just couldn't take it anymore. There is a serious lack of character development, horrible music and the input of modern elements really made it go down the drain and falling further. It jumped all over the place which failed to have the viewer connect with anyone at all. Impersonal characterization was an ongoing theme and even the attempts that were made left you with no connect or emotion. I just did not care what happened to any of the characters, if the main char would have died I would have thought ""ok, he's dead, oh well"". The only reason this debacle even gets 1 star from me is the CG and Djimon Hounsou. I do enjoy his performances but seriously question his reasoning for even accepting his role, as it is way below his level of performance ability.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

This movie fast forwarded and skipped around so much i thought the dam DVD was busted.I have a feeling they blew the budget on the CGI and scrambled to throw the rest of the content together. You know the boring stuff that doesn't really matter in movies like backstories, character development, dialog, wardrobe, actual names for characters... .. just take the dialog from snatched, change all names to Arthur or Boss,  go to the thrift store and spend 100 bucks on dungarees and trench coats, . head to forever21 and get a few cases of hair product for Charlie Hunnam and voila one turd overload of a movie! Thanks Mr.RitchieSeriously this is one of the worst movies of all times. Don't believe the positive reviews I bet 90% come from friends and family of the cast n crew. All you need to know is this: Budget: 175 Mil, Gross : 40 Mil, Loss : 135 Mil If you really want to see this move but haven't yet, I would recommend waiting until it is on regular TV.

That plus all the Ritchie trademark camera tricks and dialog stylistics seemed a bit done to death and inappropriate, making me ask myself, 'What precisely is the director attempting to get accomplished here?'But, I'm glad a gave it a second chance, because once you get past all that and the off-track story, there really is a lot to admire about the film.I grew up in the 60's and 70's when there was only one or two movies per theater, no such thing as even VCRs and a movie could reasonably expect to remain in a theater for at least a month (or, in the case of the original ""Star Wars"", in excess of 4 years). That meant a lot of repeat business (I saw SW 25 times in its original run in theaters). You had a chance to get to know a movie -- deeply -- in those bygone days.This movie brought those experiences back to me. Because -- underlying all its trite coverings -- there lurks a movie of irresistible visual details, admirably subtle acting skill, and surprising emotional impact.I told a friend of mine (who also likes movies, not just 'splosions and boobs) that great movies grow more profound with each re-watching; you notice tiny details that you hadn't -- couldn't have! -- noticed before and they change the entire context of the movie...It's just that you had to look past this movie's somewhat hideous exterior to see into its virtuous and beautiful soul. I've now seen this movie over 8 times and turns out, she's actually a beauty, indeed... I'd give it an 8; but gotta subtract 1 star for initial impression.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

So why all the unprofessional hate from the critics??? Yes, the snake was a bit much, but like she said, nobody likes the snakes. I see plenty of character development, at least in the lead actor. He's shown rising and prospering from early age. He's already a fighter and a leader, he has brains, knowledge and his trusty and skillful band, merry or not. Entire organization actually. The movie is about him, like the title says. Lots of great actors even if they don't get enough of screen time, they get their point across. It's obvious characters were long time fighting against evil regime, one way or another, waiting for the legend to come true and then getting carried away in the sheer power if it, or him. And the emotions shown or seen.. There are emotions to be seen alright. When they're hurt, they scream, when they're to die, they smile and accept it with knowledge that the fight goes on without them. I expect we are not used to raw emotions like that? I mean, nobody is depressed or committing suicide or bickering...Well, the main villain looks a bit unhappy.

This movie was pretty bad and I am sad to say it but the worst one ever. It had good effects, but deviates from any semblance of the original concept and bastardizes the plot. It is basically a mash-up of different film-styles loosely based on the King Arthur story. If you are a fan of the story, don't waste your time with this film.

For the first half everything looks like it is a long trailer and afterwards there is only fast action and special effects. There is no story, characters act without motive, reason or explanation.It's to short. With all the fast action there is absolutely no substance to it. It's nice to watch a man rise a sword but it would be nicer to know why he do it. I was raised on action movies but please there was more content in 15 minutes of Conan the Barbarian then there is in this whole production.Nothing new - if you watched Lord of the rings, Game of thrones, Marco Polo (tv series) and you have played any (modern) fantasy based computer game then this production have nothing new for you.Acting. With exclusion of Katie McGrath who played rather good for her short role (she played an naive goose) the acting was virtually non existing. I don't believe it was necessary actors fault, it's just that this production does not give much space to create an believable character.King Arthur a pimp? I know that it may not be the producers intention but it's what I see. How do you call a person that lives in a brothel, handles security, trades in contraband and have lots and lots of gold, while people that he supposedly care for need to sell their bodies on the streets to make a living. If not a pimp then what: a crime lord, mobster? Is that really a material for a good king or even for a good person? Not everything is bad. I find in nice that good mage is a woman (even if the role was played awfully) as I grow really tired of all movies depicting witches as the bad ones.

Guy Richie's version gives this story a edgy version with great street fights and battles and a villian to hate in Jude Law's protrayal of an evil King driven by desire of power. Charlie Hunnam's as the street hustler Arthur is a pleasant and refreshing take on the known character. The only issue I had was that the story felt clunky. The pacing between the character development, story conflict and action was never evenly represented.

629,DirtbagDionysus,"Interesting, but sadly falls short.",4,9 August 2017,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword portrays a modern instalment of the Arthurian legend, in Guy Richie's own words ""Lord of the Rings meets Snatch"". The Kingdom of England is usurped from its true Monarch: the child Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) by his evil uncle Vortigern (Jude Law) killing his brother the King. The orphan Arthur then lives on the streets of Londinium thieving, swindling, and fighting. But he is discovered for being the ""True King"" in a Herod-like way, comes to pull the legendary sword from the stone: Excalibur and has to then perform his destiny to overthrow the tyrannical Vortigern, much to the reluctance of Arthur.In the middle of watching the film I was immediately reminded of the Lion King, which to be perfectly frank is a much better story of a Lion cub being robbed of his birthright by his evil uncle Scar, who enacts an era of tyranny and oppression on the Kingdom which had been so benevolent under the previous administration. Quite frankly the story is the same and done better in the Lion King. Further Jude Law's character closely resembles the evil witch in the Snow White books, perhaps exacerbated by the recent Huntsman series with Charlize Theron playing the evil tyrant interested in the supernatural better than Law. With this considered, however, these are not the main flaws of the film. It is the fact that there is no character development. Each character stands in the film to support Arthur in his quest to convince him of his destiny. Then there is an action sequence where he begins to realise but needs a tad more convincing. It becomes boring and dull after the 3rd time when Arthur can't just accept who he is. This combined with the added exposition every few minutes of ""We'll do that then, aight we can do that, but I don't know? I don't trust that Bill fella."" ""Nah we'll do it this way, etc, etc."" The way it was portrayed as these people planning a job sadly made me fatigued at how dull it could be. Further, the antagonist characters are so black-and-white evil it is ridiculous, Vortigern's salute couldn't be closer to the Nazi salute if it tried. Finally, the Guy Ritchie aspect which plagues the film; introducing cockney slang, Essex accent came off as ""wrong"" in this setting, even though the typical ""posh"" accent seen in Game of Thrones is undeniable not what those in the Medieval world spoke, the whole thing comes across false and honestly pretentious. This has most likely been done to continue to the films theme of the little guy for leader rather than another inbred, aristocrat with nothing in common to the working man. However, it fails in this endeavour. Finally, the presence of Vikings, Samurai, etc is so laughably stupid that it is not even worth commenting on. Of course, it is fantasy, but Guy Richie may have taken it to far. In this, I think Guy Richie comes into play as the leader of many of its failings. People didn't want a King Arthur story to see it as a Guy Richie film, they would have wanted it for the recent rise in medieval-fantasy film and TV (Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Vikings.) But even then, I don't think many people wanted a King Arthur film anyway hence its low performance at the box office. Although this was probably on account of how bad the film was too. Having said that there were some very positive moments in the film, in fact, some very good moments with Jude Law (in his few moments of emotion being excellent) and Astrid Bergès-Frisbey being excellent. In addition to cinematography, although somewhat over-saturated by the excessive amount of CGI looked astonishingly good. Along with the excellent soundtrack.Unfortunately, however, the rest of the film failed to replicate. I do say this in some respect, many people will enjoy this film, in fact, they might love it. Fans of Guy Richie will enjoy the film most likely. I, however, did not. That is not to say I am not a fan of Richie's work; I loved the Man from U.N.C.L.E, Lock Stock, and his take on Sherlock Holmes but in this, I did not.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

I'm a big fan of Guy Ritchie's directing style and I loved seeing him take a stab at this subject. In some ways it reminded me of Knights Tale, which I also enjoyed, having the more modern soundtrack. And as someone else mentioned, the action scenes reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes and the dialogue similar to Snatch. I won't bother with any spoilers, so in my opinion, the action flowed well, the character development of Arthur from clueless, not-wanting-to-be-the-hero dweeb to okay-let's-do-this was decently done and the ending great.

636,Misadventurer,Ties with Transformers: The Last Knight with stepping on Arthurian Lore,1,30 July 2017,"This film was meant to be the first, in a King Arthur series, though due to poor box office returns and abysmal reviews, this is a one-and-done, black mark on the Legend of the British King of Lore. The film takes a major departure from the source material, Disney's animated version, is shockingly accurate at most points to how the original legend goes. Guy Ritchie plays fast and loose with all manner of historical fact and mythology. Ritchie struggles to recapture his early successes by shoddily recreating the quick cuts and asymmetrical storytelling of when Matthew Vaughn was his producer. The story is asinine, Charlie Hunnam does everything he can to show he can act (while handsome and physically fit, his acting isn't up to snuff to carry this movie) - Jude Law attempts to chew the scenery as a baddie with no reason, who has unnamed allies and is handled with much hand-waving. There are a few Game of Thrones cast that show up (Littlefinger and Roose Bolton do everything they can, but the film keeps taking on water) - I tried to stop watching, but steeled myself just to see how bad it gets and, by the very end, all i can say, is i'm glad it was only 2 hours and 6 minutes. rather than the standard 2:30 or longer that most Epic blockbusters tend to be. there is so little to this film, that even with all the montage sequences you'll find yourself scratching your head at the end. save yourself 2 hours or better yet watch Excalibur, or even the Disney Sword in the Stone.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
637,enescantamer,Film was awesome but it has some wrongs,8,26 May 2017,"First off all i liked this movie and satisfied my expectations.Graphics were awesome and director made it good.The final versus were epic i love that scene.When I was watching the film i was stuck on the storyline.If you are a Merlin fan you may not like it because storyline is too further than Merlin and also Merlin was not play in the movie only his names was it.But in the other hand everybody played well their acts.Especially Arthur was the best.I think the film is 8/10 the writer can may better anyways if you are undecided to watch this movie i'll say watch it , you don't lose anything after you watching you may thank me :)",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
638,roadrun374,Impressive indeed,10,14 May 2017,"I thought to go be entertained for a time, and King Arthur looked to fit the bill.I was stunned. I got much more than I ever expected. This is a must see movie, have no doubt. I have to say that every time Jude Law, Djimon Hounsou, or Eric Bana was in the scene, they drown out all other characters. Just great acting on their part. What a pleasure to see. That kind of screen presence is magical. At first, I didn't catch on as to how well cast Astrid Berges-Frisbey was, but it came out as a masterful pick of a superb actor. Nice work to the casting director, good job!In no way do I mean to take away from any of the other actors, all nailed their parts, every single one!Guy Ritchie outdid himself. I enjoyed his technique in Sherlock, but this was even a tad bit of an improvement. The music caught my attention and held it. Just a great job, impressive plus.All in all, I couldn't have been more impressed at such a stunning movie. The story was done well, the casting was spot on, the acting shined, music captured, and the direction should be awarded.Go see this one.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
639,Michael-s-dugan,"Lock, Stock, and Excalibur?",2,28 April 2019,"I grew up a fan of the Arthurian stories and movies. This was a terrible disappointment. The dialog in this movie makes me think Arthur will claim the crown with a clever heist with some plucky mates and snappy slang. It has Guy Ritchie's fingerprints all over it. When does not feel like a bad parody of Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels it feels like a rejected Game of Thrones script with some dance music thrown in.
The story could have been updated by giving us some gritty 8th century realism, instead we get camp.I blame Madonna for ruining Guy Ritchie.Worth a watch when you are sitting at home with your SO on a Saturday night and you need something on Netflix, as long as you have zero expectations.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The story line seems like it's missing some points. It starts in a way than fast brings you in another place passing quickly over some information. And in the end they try to give it to you but on that time you kind of lost the interest to find out what really happened. The end also is too predictable.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The movie was really really good. It was intense, exciting, bonus points for a super attractive lead! Everyones acting was really good, especially Jude Law (who was maybe too convincing) and Charlie Hunnam(?). The little boy called Blue stole every scene he was in. Guy Ritchie did a cracking job, the music and camera angles plus general style of the film made it interesting and quick paced with some witty banter.Did have a couple of general questions, why did building a taller tower mean he had more power? Where was Merlin? Who was Maggie? Was this Mage girl actually Merlin? How did he not remember what happened he was like 8? The three women in the basement, who were they?

But we are talking about a very old story here. And its been told many different ways over the years. Some bad and some good and some excellent. It all comes down to ""did you enjoy it and would you pay again to see more."" I say Absolutely. It is not at all shoddy or poorly made.

Thats apart as far as it goes o and i hate jude law but not in this i thought he was really good. The film lets start from we knowing it would be bad. In one of the first scenes the wife gets killed and then we hear this loud as music that doesn't go. Right then im ready to say its no good.I watched on and every emotional death was met with none and brushed away. David beckham appearing just made it feel cheap. The fight scenes are so fast you cant see nothing. There is parts that are good from what i seen but a lot of the rest near the end i went to sleep for.Some people like these types of films there just not for me",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

If you like something fresh and new, if you're open for that sort of thing, THEN GO AND SEE IT!

I didn't make it through the film, it was torture watching most of it, hoping some miracle would happen and the positive reviews I read would come true. That didn't happen and it's baffling how anyone would give this film more than 2 stars which would be overly generous. Have you ever watched an MTV video spliced with a commercial and a video game? Sort of like that. Flat, cardboard characters (I couldn't have cared less who lived or died other than Jude Law who was the only character that seemed to have an inkling of substance), the CGI was meh, the story was schizophrenic and confusing, there was no legitimate plot development and the script was horrible. I have no idea what this movie was trying to do or for what purpose it was made, but certainly not to entertain anyone on any level. Except maybe teenagers who think crap like this is worth watching.

As an English kid, King Arthur was a large part of my childhood and growing up, all the films and legends etc, right through to now in my old age (lol).This film really has hardly anything AT ALL to do with King Arthur! It has stupid large monsters, snakes, octopus lady (what the hell??), poor acting.. and why do Americans think English all speak like that too.Also since when does the king Arthur legend have knights in it dressed in black with metal face masks and not suits of armour! In this film they look more like something out of 300, the Persians...absolute rubbish.Yes there is Excalibur in it but that is about as far as this piece of Hollywood rubbish gets.Hollywood what were you thinking of! my god, you should be ashamed! If the film was nothing to do with King Arthur then yes it would have been an average film, 5/10. BUT this was supposed to be King Arthur! Hollywood you get 0/10 !

654,bmav,A Rare 10 Star Review: The Biggest Surprise Ever.,10,27 July 2017,"When I saw the trailers for this film, I was unimpressed. I saw a movie that looked low-budget, unremarkable, and not worth my time... Then I went to the theater...After the first scene, I was literally on the edge of my seat and my jaw was on the floor. I was looking back and forth between my family and the screen, confused and speechless. The opening scene was AMAZING, surely the rest of the film cant be this good... Can it? No. The rest was EVEN BETTER. The music, the cinematography, the story, the action, the humor, the twists, the originality that came from one of the most adapted stories of all time, it was unbelievable! It shocked me to the point that my hands were literally in the air and I was whispering ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME??"" to my wife as she laughed at my enthusiasm. The action in this movie was at a level I have never seen before. Guy Ritchie turned it up to 11 to portray the might of Excalibur and the Ferocity of the most stunning villain I have ever seen. Charlie Hunnam's portrayal of Arthur was amazing, inspiring and totally original, and Jude Law was amazing as a complex and totally convincing antagonist. Guy Ritchie's signature was all over this movie in all the best ways, and he gave this film a great amount of character and spirit that was refreshing and revolutionary. Whoever was in charge of advertising for this film should be fired. It was totally undersold and deserves a spot with the greats, which it will sadly never be recognized for. This was the biggest and most pleasant surprise I have ever experienced when seeing a film in theaters. I WILL be purchasing this movie in the most expensive bundle I can find. It has earned my business forever. Go see this film.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

I cannot imagine how anyone could greenlight this script - i have done a lot of drugs but there is no drug strong enough to have made me think this turd had a chance, .

This time is no different. Critics have been pretty negative about this movie. However, I really loved and enjoyed this movie. It didn't drag in spots and kept me interested the whole time. It had great graphics, acting, story line, and enough action to keep me interested as well. I really loved the music too. It wasn't the typical orchestral or symphony music you hear in movies like this. You really have to hear it in theater to understand. I read critic reviews about how they hated how they chopped up the story of Arthur, but I sure enjoyed this version a lot better than previous boring tales and movies about King Arthur.

It was a reason for my disappointing - personage from storytails were not compatipable with real personages of those days.
I think Guy Ritchie felt the same, when he was shooting ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"".It's a story about typical fighter of our days - with flexible mind, little cheater but very open-hearted man. This kind of people become a leader in nowadays.Main character is played by Charles Hunnam which for the most fans will the classical son of anarchy for a long time. And I find a lot of similar things in anarchy and Medieval centuries - Will survive not the strongest person, but the trickiest.I really recommend for all Ritchie's fans this film ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Swords"".",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

662,petrasjanulevicius,King Arthur brexit salvation,6,12 June 2017,"Have you seen King Arthur? I did and I recommend you to watch and I can't stop myself from making a laugh from it.Here is a story about the usual Brits story with a slice of Brexit and England patriotism or what's left of it. There are two brothers, one is a king the other is jealous which usually has black hair while the ""good"" lad has blond hair ( cheers for blond lads) then wait and he gets killed by his brother. The Kings ""bastard"" boy survives, grows up in a brothel, learns how to fight, probably becomes famous because he has the king of the blood in his veins and wears clothes from 21st century H & M shop while everyone around him is looking medievalish~. Story continues, he appears to be ""the one"" and obviously does not want to take the responsibility for ""bringing back the order"", then again the whole country is more than happy to create riots, die for whatever reason, and well just burn the city. Cool. Let's move on. Suddenly the young lad again with blond hair gets a kick in his arse and suddenly with his Bolton or whichever accent becomes the hero who will reclaim its England rightful ""order"", suddenly gets super powers like one of the Marvel heroes but still is a noob comparing to the main Marvel protagonists but hey we are talking about an ordinary unordinary brit young lad that will save your country ( just like a labour party right?) and by all means he will do it in the Brit way - you know, kill, burn, take by force then apologise. Alright, the final boss looks like a mix of Diablo, Witcher or whichever other game, tons of post production, in fact, there is probably more post production than Avatar required but hey you gotta save the England right in a snazzy style.Right at the end, the lad suddenly gets on their knee a Viking messenger even though Vikings were fearless and screwed England for good but not this time. This time it's different.Finished watching the movie? Feeling suddenly patriotic and how fearless England is? Well, that's what they want to make you feel.Well, that's called when the country is so messed up that they need King Arthur story, tons of post production to rise the patriotism in the country.Yeah, the movie special effects are superb but just can't help to laugh how desperate the country is to raise their patriotic morale.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
663,sierraroseschwartz,Lacking,5,19 August 2017,"Firstly, Charlie Hunnam wasn't a great choice for the role of Arthur. He portrayed an Arthur that was tough, buff and a natural leader but that's about all. Eric Bana did more in his fraction of screen time than Charlie did the entire film. Charlie was wooden as others have stated but he seemed like his look and persona would be better suited for a men's fitness magazine - not a noble king. Glaringly absent was the presence of Merlin, who should have been a pivotal character. There was also no love interest. I'm assuming these elements would have been present in sequels but it left this film lacking. Another issue was over reliance on CGI. the final showdown between Arthur and the Jude Law character was lacking emotional impact because he's just fighting this demon creature and it doesn't translate well. It would have been better with a more realistic showdown between the two actual actors. Speaking of realistic - he becomes Thor with the magic sword. He just needs to grab the handle and the bad guys practically dispatch themselves. When you watch a movie like this you want to be transported to another world and the film failed in that respect. Impressive CGI, a leading man with a v-taper, and hackneyed editing does not a great movie make.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
664,fergal-10264,Suspend critical thought before watching - if you can.,2,25 July 2017,I was told to suspend critical thought and just enjoy this for the romp it is.Sorry its so bad i just couldn't do it. This film falls between two genres 1. the historical costume drama and 2. fantasy. It works as neither. It definitely doesn't try in any way to be historically accurate. So why bother at all. The use of the Arturian Legend just seems to make this film a bore because you already know who is going to win. Which makes it harder for the already poor script to create a sense of suspense. The fantasy side of it is pretty pathetic with loads of shots and sequences almost lifted directly from the lord of the rings.This film is recommended to people who like to see famous people dressed up in fancy dress but isn't recommended for anyone looking for intelligent fantasy or historical drama.Charlie Hunnam is there any worse actor who gets cast in such high budget films??? The rest of the cast were good but let down by terrible script and direction.In summary a cross between lord of the rings and peaky blinders that totally fails to do justice to either genre.,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

What I received, however, was a cinematic thrill which kept me enthralled throughout with clever dialogue, fast-paced action, captivating camera shots, and phenomenal acting by an impressive cast. As expected, the story was retold with a fantasy-like vibe oft seen in the likes of ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Narnia"", and ""300"" to name a few examples.

All the actors of course did great, mostly the bad king played by a superb Jude Law.

670,tigertrainer,Sword in the Stone? Pull the other one!,1,24 June 2017,"Arthurian Legends have been rehashed for over 800 years. Originating with French & German Holy Grail related tales they became Classics.I'm always keen to see new interpretations of the Tale. Having watched this latest offering I can only put the high rating from many folk on this site down to them being paid placements by Producer PR machines.In a word this was pathetic. The acting was more ordinary than a Sci Fi Channel Sharkanado spin-off.The CGI made the 1960's BBC Dr Who series seem like Kubrick. As King Crimson once sang - ""Confusion will be my Epitaph"" Guy Ritchie clearly set out to confuse any plot or character development with video disco editing. He actually made the Clash of the Titans remake look good!After LOTR any Movie that uses Mammoth Elephants in the opening scenes should be a Dumbo Alert. No originality, given that Star Wars based their Mech Warrior Machines last century on Giant Elephants. So no kudos to Peter Jackson LOTR - cos they weren't in the book either. Ritchie is off to a cheap CGI Start. Gondor never looked so Londinium like! Pathetic rip off not even an homage!Then we have the weird proposition - that Mordred is the evil Wizard and Vortigern is the brother of Uther. OK - it's fantasy but when I read reviewers who say this is the definitive Arthur tale I cringe. Don't worry about FAKE NEWS - we are abused by Ritchie with FAKE FANTASY HISTORY. The Arthurian Legend revolves around Arthur's fatal flaw - Not Lancelot and Gwen but that he had sex with his sister Morgan Le Faye and fathered Mordred! Sir Thomas Malory would be rolling in his grave! In essence, the entire Arthurian Legend is about deception and to that extent I give Guy Ritchie a 1 for deceiving his viewers with a poor story that doesn't deserve a sequel and by the box office $$$ won't get one!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

672,vicky_lc2001-1,Great Arthurian adaptation ever since Boorman's classic Excalibur,9,21 May 2017,"I just saw King Arthur & I have to say I loved it! I'm into a lot of Arthurian themed films or sword/sandals films & since Boorman's Excalibur, I have never felt that grand epic mythical legendary film/story since then until this new film. & that is what I love about Excalibur - grand, epic, badass, legend, & myth - these are all the things I loved about the underrated Excalibur.  And since that film, every other Arthurian film was made in a more realistic manner, which THE 2004 version is the biggest culprit. It seems people today unless it's straight out fictional, want every single film to be grounded in reality to the point where you make no room for magic, for myths/legends, or for fantasy/fairy tales.  The legend of King Arthur is more than a love story  (First Knight) or some bland realistically themed Roman General (the 2004 version), & of course there's the musical Camelot w/ the great Richard Harris w/c was the very 1st Arthurian film I ever saw but never really cared for (esp Lancelot - ech!). The story of King Arthur is an epic legend from some far away distant ancient land of how a boy rose to become a great King & died in the same grand fashion. It's reminiscent of the many fables & myths in every cultural past/traditions, it's almost biblical even, like Samson, Solomon, or King David. Myths & legends are not realistic stories, they are stories meant to move the mind, the passions, & your imagination, they are there to entertain, to have a moral lesson, to be an example of masculine integrity & honor despite human frailties & faults, & it's sad that people dismiss such vital integral things w/c made the myth & legend of Arthur endure & flourish for that bland & tasteless 2004 version. Boorman's Excalibur remains the best because it embraces our inner childhood, our ancient longings & superstitions, & our wild & expansive imagination that every other version discards until the 2017 version.I honestly was never going to see this 2017 film until it came out on bluray or until it appeared on Netflix. Why? Well, the marketing & ads for this film were not as persistent/as good as many of the Disney flicks. The trailer itself did not recommend the film though there have been other films I loved that had abysmal trailers (The 13th Warrior - another underrated McTiernan film).  I saw the film simply because Chris Stuckman gave it a good review and you know what? I loved it far more than he did and unlike Chris, I see no fault in the plot or the script. In fact, I found it to be quite tight.  I loved how the Mage referenced/asked Arthur ""if he turned away (in one of his visions)"" & that ""we all turn away but that is what separates a man from a king.""  - and we get this catharsis, this closing of the circle when he realizes what that meant in that vital moment and it's one of the most exhilarating things I have ever felt in a film.  Jude Law was fantastic in this & I loved him as a villain.  A hero is only as good as its villain & many films have weak villains, look at the new Star Trek films. Questions on the killings he does but is heart broken to do, the defeat/loss of Excalibur are all answered at the right moment, when it is the most satisfying. The use of the musical score is so effective & used so well & so precisely that it gets your blood pumping, I have never felt that in any ANY other Arthurian film except in Excalibur when O FORTUNA plays. & this film is diff. enough from Excalibur in style, plot, & telling while remaining true to the spirit & epic grandness of Excalibur that it is fresh & exciting! & let's not forget the montages, the MONTAGES! I absolutely loved them! Anyone who says they don't love them in the Rocky films is lying. These montages used in the Rocky series gets your blood fueled, it makes you want to imitate the protagonist, & it remains in our collective consciousness because it is effective & blood inducing. Unfortunately montages today are remnants of the past, of the 80s galore (Rocky films, even Scarface), & are avoided like the plague bec it was seen as excessive & quintessentially 80s. But Ritchie has brought it back here & I revel in it! REVEL! I was grinning stupidly watching this film, esp. in those montages. It takes a lot of guts to do something people have dismissed for almost 30yrs & to bring it back & do it effectively. I firmly believe that King Arthur (2017) will be considered one of the underrated classics, trashed on its release but will be a beloved film as time goes on.  An underrated classic amongst (The Thing 1980, Excalibur, Apocalypto, The 13th Warrior, Dark City, Unbreakable, Empire of the Sun, & Scarface 1983).It is a pity though that this was to be the 1st installment of a 6 series film, 1 I would love to have but I don't think we will ever get that, & that is heartbreaking.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

One may also admire well-done direction, unique music and fantasy style.From the very first minutes of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword a viewer can clearly see that this production is not a usual film. It is packed with heavy action, flashbacks from the main character's past and really good acting, which I didn't quite expected. At first, story may seem confusing, and one can think it doesn't add up, but as the narrative arc develops, you start to understand and appreciate this really well-thought-out direction. Unfortunately, for my taste, there was too much CGI and seeing fast-paced events constantly moving forward with only a few breaks was sometimes a bit weary. Nevertheless, I recommend to watch this certainly interesting motion picture on one's own.Conclusively it is some fresh approach to Arthurian Legends, wrapped up into magic, steel and roguery.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Oh, the gimmicks!",3,12 May 2017,"My wife and I saw this and while she enjoyed it due to the interesting and unique story line, I saw it as a miserable failure due to the constant filming gimmicks used. There was no cohesiveness at all.From the 5 minutes filmed with a Gopro that made me sick, to a scene that could have been in the Matrix, to a fight scene that looked like it belonged in a Korean MMO, and the fact that the entire movie was saddled with CGI that was mediocre at times. There was no ""style"" you could put to this movie except ""cluttered.""One scene didn't actually happen (really, I mean that,) another was ripped out of the Ocean's 11 planning session. At times the movie would randomly fast forward (I mean the playback speed) and slow down, and jump from clip to clip every few seconds. It was enough to be seizure inducing. And if you're looking for any sort of lore or historical accuracy, forget it. It's only about King Arthur because there's sword in a stone that's not actually a stone, so it fails on that as well.All in all I wish I hadn't wasted my money and instead watched it in 3 months when they push it onto TNT or SyFy prime time, as I'm sure it's destined to be.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Unfortunately for this movie, Guy Ritchie over estimated the intelligence of his audience. Average intelligence people got confused with the montages/cut scenes. Therefore, they didn't like it because it made them feel stupid for not understanding it. As an adult who has struggled with ADHD for my whole life, this movie could not have been more perfect.

Excellent VFX that's how it should be in a blockbuster (Or in this case a $175 million movie!!). Fighting Choreography was over the top and so is the camera works. Also little bit above average editing and sound editing.Now comes the worse to worst part. Thing is while I was watching this movie (Not after) I thought, is this the sequel of Warcraft (2016). That movie was not a great film still made lots of many outside of North America.Now the story, I have not read any King Arthur legends, I just knew that only Arthur can wield the Excalibur. So my question is why use a Warcraft story while you can use so many legends for the story.Lastly Charlie Hunman should not carry a Blockbuster. He has not got the Box Office power. I think even David Beckham could carry the movie in any football (Soccer) loving country. Other casts were talented but not for those role.Bottom line is story and casting of lead role made the movie a super flop.

693,madcap7,More Lord of the Rings Than Arthurian Legend,2,28 July 2017,"What has been done with this film is they've made a fantasy film and attached it to the Arthurian Legend. This film was not entertaining, one bit. I really enjoyed Lock Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Sherlock Holmes, and RocknRolla but I didn't like Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, which wasn't as good as the first, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., which was rubbish and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, which is utter rubbish. I watched this without any preconceived perceptions (except it would be a retelling of the King Arthur legend) and I hoped it would be a top notch film. It wasn't, even if it was just simply a fantasy film with no connection to the King Arthur mythology it still wouldn't be worth watching, described as Lord of the Rings meets Snatch is true and it just doesn't work. The setting is, supposedly, Post Roman Britain but the society is more akin to Snatch, it doesn't look or sound right You might as well have the characters ask if anyone wants to go for a cheeky Nando's, or cry ""nice one bruva!"" and it's surprising no one, after a slight ribbing, says ""banter"" after. There is no historical accuracy except for the weapons and clothing in as far as there aren't any assault rifles or trainers. The armour or shield designs aren't anything from European history. With gigantic elephants that are taller than the Statue of Liberty with siege weapons and pyramids on their backs, huge rats, bats, and colossal snakes. If you expected to watch an Arthurian epic retelling the legend that is King Arthur don't watch this film. If you want to watch a film like Clash of the Titans then this film then this is your cup of tea.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

I must admit, I wasn't expecting much, especially when I saw Beckham's cameo in the trailer..

Even on a second viewing (in theaters), I knew there were elements of the story that were just beyond my grasp.Once the movie came out on streaming services, all the pieces of this movie fell in together beautifully. Thanks in large part to English subtitles. Everything from Vortigern's exchange with the whispering Syrens, to Arthur's banter with Jack's Eye (within the first 23 minutes of the movie) was lost in translation on my first two viewings.Outstanding acting all around. Jude Law owns the part of being the heavy Vortigern, nicely complementing the reluctant hero/bad boy Arthur played by Charlie Hunnan.Everything else - action sequences, special effects, costumes and props, musical scores, scenes and backgrounds - were deftly handled by director Guy Ritchie.One of my all-time favorites.

The idea of Arthur being whisked away by his father before his death and raised in a brothel, where he repressed memories of the event is intriguing. The movie is about the process of Arthur accepting his past and who he is, while learning how to control Excalibur. There were several humorous moments in the movie, which added to the attraction. This tale will keep you glued to your seats!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
704,gianburrasca,Not what you expect (in a good way),8,20 May 2017,"I do not understand the critics, their bashing of this movie is so unjustified it casts doubts about their integrity. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is not John Boorman's Excalibur, in today's industry that movie would never be produced, but this is a fun, action-packed movie with a heart and a brain.1) Guy Ritchie reworks heavily the Arthurian legend, so what? To this day there is no evidence King Arthur even existed, and over the centuries the legend has been endlessly reworked and revised. A legend should be judged on its self-consistency alone, Ritchie's movie in its simplicity does not slip in this department.2) The frantic pacing could have easily resulted (see the recent recent Snyder's Batman vs Superman) in two dimensional characters and in a confused plot, instead Ritchie pulls off a level of narrative synthesis which is nothing short of exemplary: watch for instance the sequence following the coming of age of Arthur, from a boy to a man. Fast cutting is to Guy Ritchie what sequence shots where to Orson Welles, a tool to pursue a higher artistic level. The critics that bash this movie for its short cuts are simply out of their depths.3) The comedy relief moments come in the right doses and are well timed, contrary to the latest - critically acclaimed - Disney's Star Gags, or Marvel's Guardians of the Stupidity. Yes the jokes are sometimes subtle and the character never try too hard to make the audience laugh, is that a problem? Only for the dumb and the numb.4) The one-on-one/one-on-many sword fights are epic, I wish there were more of that and less of ""humongous monster wrecks titantic building"" sequences, but that is today's cinema.Kudos to Warner Bros. to give art a chance and to assume the blockbusters' audience has yet some grey matter to spend at the cinema.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

I get it. I would have been bummed had I paid to see this in the theater. But streaming the movie at home for free (or maybe on one of the paid services, I can't remember) - it was great fun.But it felt like I was watching a series or miniseries, rather than a movie.

707,warren-633-445289,Guy Ritchie has hit the nail on the head with this Fantasy film.,10,10 May 2017,"King Arthur: Legend of the SwordI am not a cynical person and I tend to see the good in something, most of the time cynical people will feel the need to crucify an artifact if it disrupts their sensibilities. But it is rare when a film touches someone so deeply that they who seldom type a review to type one.I went into the film expecting an excellent film and it exceeded expectations, from what I saw from the trailer I knew this wasn't going to be another forgettable blockbuster film with no character. The trailer itself had creativity which is lacking in most films today, an appeal, a certain style that offers uniqueness and it's this uniqueness that gives the film significant value.I loved the structure of the storytelling, we are introduced to plenty of characters and somehow the film gets across the feeling that we know each and every character introduced. This is the function of these fast pasted micro stories within the film, you need to be paying attention to keep up. While keeping interest within the main character and his struggles. It can be noted that the film has the lovable rogue trope down to a T.If not paying attention and fully immersing yourself within this film its artistry could be overlooked or the denouement may be an 'ok' or 'I got entertained just as I expected to be' and may be seen as just another big blockbuster film, the fact that it came out one week after GotG would not help this case.The FX are incredible and well put together in a cohesive manner, you will see the famous Guy Ritchie slow-mo action sequences. Incredible zoom in-out and pan across on action sequences much like Assassins Creed. All to communicate to the viewer exactly what is going on and where.I understand there are a thousand different contributing factors that make someone like or dislike a film.I am in a good place within my life and I am a great lover of fantasy, this story captivated me and made me feel empathy toward the characters. The way the story was told was relevant today it was quick and fast paced for today's attention spans. I greatly enjoyed the English slang humour it was quick wit at its best and to see within a fantasy film was a delight. It has shown the fantasy genre in a new light and hopefully inspires other film artists to apply out of the box thinking when creating fantasy films.I can see how people not from the UK would not get the humour and may not fully understand the distinctions between meaning and intention. Everyone will take away something different depending where you are within your life and as to what reason we watch films. You can take away an entertaining fast pasted fantasy film where good triumphs evil. Alternatively, you can take away philosophical means after all that is the single principle of storytelling. For me, it related to the journey of finding yourself and your purpose and most importantly that we all have the strength to become the person we are. Themes of death were prominent, as was loyalty and family.All in all excellent film will watch again.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

If you like his way of filming action, use of music and camera work, this movie will leave you pleasantly surprised.The story leaves a bit to be desired, though that seems to be a pitfall of any myth retelling. The movie makes up for it by having great characters to accompany you through the predictable story. The action pieces and writing are great, and the music is even better.It's important to note that there wasn't a single performance I found underwhelming in the movie. Two definite stand outs are Charlie Hunnam and Jude Law. Both had wonderfully written parts and they both made the most out of them.To conclude, it's an action movie, but one with a soul and characters you care about.

717,edeitsch5,I wish people would read the reviews,10,12 June 2019,I wish this score was judged by those who wrote a review not just hit a star amount. This movie is so stylistically unique it's refreshing from the usual basic slapstick storylines that are constantly being churned out by the Hollywood money machine. I created an IMDB account just to review this title since the average value is far under what it should be. I would rate 9/10 but this average rating needs to be raised. Unique film you won't find anywhere else. I feel bad for Guy Ritchie who obviously had so much more to add but there's only so much screen time you can put into a film especially a newer film that isn't going to draw a crowd as easy as other franchises.,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
718,bazikmarek,Oh man another god awful movie.,2,1 January 2019,"It's hard to find words. The story is flat. It wont immerse you in any kind. It's flashy, fast. But that's it. The future king talks like a ghetto gangster. He has no charisma at all. The actor plays it like ""Can we get over this. I have something in the oven cooking you know."" Where's Merlin? I know from experience that women can be witches. But not in this story. First I thought it is some kind of a youtube fan made movie. But then I realized that the sets are to expensive. And I've seen better fan made movies. It's another Robin Hood, Star Wars, JJ Star trek (this was actually far better in comparison). Common people are you too scared or just too lazy to make a proper epic fantasy drama? In a commercial here it was compared to Lord of the rings. What a joke.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

720,nagaswaroop-yv-71-376605,This is what movie making is all about,10,31 May 2017,"I won't tell you anything about the story, the characters or the Spoilers. All I want to tell you, this is how a movie should be made. The screen play, the back ground music, the cinematography, the locations and the way the director holds you to the edge of your seat till the very end. I've understood that this movie is a box office disaster in the US, thanks to GOT. Honestly, GOT has got Nudity, sex, violence, bloodshed, rage, revenge and drama. This movie has the pace which doesn't get you bored at any given stage. If you're a true movie lover who appreciates good stuff over nonsense, then this is it.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
721,projectile-106-490735,A balanced review,6,2 July 2017,"Let's start with the positives, there is some interesting and bold montage work here. I think this has potential as a modern approach to exposition. I admire the way even some of the more stupendous action is glossed over, or rushed through. From the colour treatment and aesthetic of the film to the imaginative form, giant elephants and mythic qualities, it is very creative and compelling. The action sequences provide plenty of eye candy and spectacle. The first problem with the film is that many of the characters are unlikable. The film starts with action and neglects any attempt to build empathy with the characters. The main character is too arrogant and we never see him show any human weakness. There are elements of the film that are truly brilliant but it is quite unbelievable. If you like game of thrones and are about 13, you will probably love this film. I am personally more interested in a realistic portrayal of what I consider to be historical, rather than just fantastical.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
722,dresposure,Enjoyed it absolutely,8,2 July 2017,Would love to see a sequel to it.The plot and direction highlights the brilliance of Guy Ritchie. Already a big fan of Ritchie. Would love to see more of this. The comic angle was missing though. Channing Tatum is brilliant and so is Jude Law. The special effects were brilliant and so was the cinematography along with soundtrack.,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
723,elracraft,At least you'll laugh out loud at the unintentional humor,5,28 July 2017,"Man, what a stinker! As someone who loves most of Guy Ritchie's movies I gotta say this was terrible. The trailer already made me cringe and it was even worse than I thought it was gonna be. The worst is the editing, skipping back and forth between scenes intermixed. Second is the dialogue, which is so terrible, you'll roll your eyes at the actual jokes, but laugh out loud at whatever they blurt out at any given time. Nothing can make up for the terrible editing and dialogue so I'm gonna end it right here.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
724,essmd,"Great the First Watch, Better each time after!!!",9,9 June 2018,"Having no expectations, this was a great story and action-filled movie the first time watched, but each time viewed it just gets better. Perhaps with the all the time-shifting in the editing, repeated views reveals the brilliance of the storyline told by Guy Ritchie and his team to make this a truly classic interpretation of this historic time in England's past.The acting is superb by all characters, and the CG effects are supporting without overachieving it's purpose.It's in my library it's up there along with Gladiator, Braveheart, Dances with Wolves and others...The beating it took at the box office is an enigma, for the potential for great sequels is not likely",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
725,efeyenibayrak,Forget all the King Arthur related products you have seen,9,6 July 2017,"The King Arthur story, leading by Charlie Hunnam. I was expecting a really dull movie to be honest, specially considering Hunnam's acting style(which contained only 1 gesture). However, Guy Ritchie changed the perspective of the story, made us watch a hero being born, from zero to hero and with his style of editing and dialogues, made it really fun for us to watch. Soundtrack was just wonderful, fit every scene perfectly. Hunnam was at his best, Ritchie's magic fingers have touched him as well and in the end, a great product is before us. Make sure you watch this movie, i guarantee you will enjoy every minute.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
726,dtptfitness,Can't get enough of this movie..,10,24 January 2018,"If you don't like this movie, then you should watch it again because you obviously don't get it. I'll be the first person to admit that it took me quite a long tolime to get around to seeing this film--part of which was my bias to Game of Thrones and not wishing to subject myself to a lesser-done version of.But, as saturated as the medieval fantasy genre may seem, this film does an outstanding job of providing a refreshing rendition of an age-old tale without making you feel like, ""Oh, I've seen this story before and know how it goes.""Keep in mind, that this is a Guy Ritchie film about the most English thing you could probably have with the Knights of the Room Table and King Arthur. Even in a period piece like this, the dialogue packs the same moxy you'd hope to expect. Combined with the delivery done by the outstanding casting and superior visual effects, the entire film does everything it needs to do as the first chapter of an epic movie series (1 of 6) without trying too hard or overdoing it.The soundtrack is phenomenal. The story is so well done.As a GoT fan, I also think the movie does the perfect homage to it. I'd put this film right there next to your classic battle films like: Gladiator, Braveheart, Kingdom of Heaven, Lord of the Rings, and such.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
727,imgivinn,Oh my! That was SO fun!,10,2 November 2021,"The scope, swagger, effects, music/score, cinematography and story were amazing. I cared not at all about the departure King Arthurs of the past. It reminded me of Lord of the Rings at its best, but was substantially darker. It was absolutely a blast to watch. Intense, even a bit awe-inspiring at times. Jude Law was terrific in his awfulness. Please, please let there be a sequel.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
728,cmdavies,It's worth it if you throw away what you know,9,19 April 2019,"Yes, I am a fan of the King Arthur legend and I was therefore naturally worried going into this, especially with a 6.8 IMDB avg score.But I'm glad I watched this. This was just good fun! It was a bit Arthurian legend, mixed with Robin Hood, mixed with Lord of the Rings (giant elephants anyone!), but I enjoy all these tales, so a well done blend kept me happy.Fabulous sharp script and soundtrack, good British humour and a wonderful tale. There is the man, the sword, the Lady of the Lake, and sorcery. A band of merry men... sorry, knights of the round table, and while The Mage was pretty cool, her accent was the only negative for me.Get the popcorn and sit back for some good fun.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

730,cdicke,Great Film with Suspect CGI,8,15 May 2017,"This film has all of the Guy Ritchie tropes. The acting is great, except for a couple of 'english as a second language' moments. The story is lean, but more in a Charlie Hunnam way than a Calista Flockhart way. One scene, that should have been very cool, was rushed to the point of being incomprehensible.Some action scenes are easy to follow while others are jumpy. Nothing ruins action like jump cuts and closeups.The music is phenomenal. If half of the $175 million budget went to the score, it would be a justified expense.Overall, this is a great new take on the Arthur mythology and a must see for action and action-comedy fans.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
731,dfagboyegun,Glad i didn't go see this in the cinema,4,27 June 2017,"I was not in the least bit satisfied at the end of this movie. It all felt so awkward, forced, edgy. The story was bland, characters were meh and the fantasy portion wasn't elaborated on which i disliked. Whoever was in charge of the cinematography did a terrible job regarding the action scenes, you hardly knew what was going on half the time. Don't get me started on all the slow-mo stop motion pretty poorly done.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The story is all over the place no real narrative just a garbled mess that jumps all over the place and cuts in and out of scenes out of nowhere all thrown together in a childishly horrifying manner. I cant believe anyone fronted the money for this movie to happen... My 5 year old nephew could write a better and more complete story... If you still intend on watching this i would suggest doing so highly intoxicated so you arent as aware of the torment you are about to recieve...,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Charlie Hunnam, Astrid Bergès, Jude Law & the rest of this talented cast, I loved Charlie Hunnam (Arthur) & Astrid Bergès (The Mage), and I must mention the perfect soundtrack by Daniel Pemberton. I did not expect the movie to be from the actual Arthur legend, and I don't want it to be, it's an action movie and it delivers, I loved every second of it, and I wish we have more of such gems.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
734,mattcolcombe,For the fun of it,8,24 June 2017,"I like Guy Ritchie's style with his no silly bo**ocks approach. He gets the job done in the end to where a lot of work is condensed into a no-nonsense narrative. The movie has two levels, a purely entertaining one and a deeper one, an often told narrative of a man who rises up to a challenge by overcoming his demons and owning himself. What wraps up this movie well is the soundtrack. Not many movies do I happily sit through the end credits of, but the soundtrack was so good in this film that it had me staying until the cleaners came in.One thing I truly hope and the main reason I'm writing this, is to do whatever small bit I can to push for a sequel. Some characters could've been developed more and, if done right, this movie could be the British Star Wars franchise with a quick wit. It has all the ingredients, hero's journey, magic, archetypes and action with a little epic music on the side (a song with lyrics 1000 years old, come on!) I want more!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

I come to imdb for some sense of whether a movie I'm planning to watch is worth it - but the 5s and 6s on masterpieces like this (and 8s on dubious stuff like the second Suicide Squad) make me think imdb is a big opposites game.What I'm trying to say - thank you, people commenting and reviewing, for setting records straight! And anyone else for wanting to make their own opinion.I think King Arthur is refreshing, gripping, thrilling - just wait for the first time Arthur properly wields Excalibur, goose bumps guaranteed!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

So if you liked Braveheart, Gladiator, and Troy DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.Now if you like SCI-FI movies that try to be funny with cool looking actors that can't act then this movie is for you.Maybe this is for teenagers I don't know, but this was a big fail in my book.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
737,honorheart-77971,Ugh. Nothing redeemable here.,2,5 August 2017,"This movie was awful. The spastic story telling and nerve wracking music was obviously geared toward teenage boys and gaming geeks. Any good acting was quickly degraded by the need of the director to be show how clever he could be rather than offer up a good story line that draws the viewer in with strong, likable well developed characters. I read that this is one of six movies in a franchise. Ugh. I won't be watching any more of these.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
738,pierobaiani,Terrible,3,25 July 2017,I gave it two points for the money that must have went into this.It's terrible. I don't know how anyone could have liked it. One reviewer said (paraphrasing) that people didn't like it because it wasn't true to the story of King Arthur. This is bollox. People don't like this movie because it's terrible.How it has a score over 7 on IMDb is beyond me.,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
739,QuentinBurnham,Guy Ritchie always delivers,8,29 March 2018,"First of all, I gotta say that Ritchie is one of the most underrated directors there's ever been. His Sherlock Holmes movies, The Man from U.N.C.L.E or Snatch? Great movies, if you ask me. I wouldn't call them masterpieces, but they contain lots of fun, rememberable characters and cool action scenes. His films are just fun to watch.And same goes for King Arthur. I was a little bit skeptical when i saw the announcement of this adaptation, since many things can go wrong with movies like this. But then it all came together. Great cast, unbelievable work with camera during action scenes(Kingsman vibe included) and fantastic soundtrack by Daniel Pemberton. And those are just a few positive aspects, because this movie has even more to offer.Don't be distracted by contradictory reviews and just watch it. It might be one of the best movies that Fantasy genre with PG-13 rating has to offer now.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
740,jackbreckner,Deserves more attention than it got.,10,26 March 2018,"I just watched this move after passing it over many times on various movie renting services. I finally watched it last night and was very surprised with how much I enjoyed it. It borrows the name ""King Arthur"" and a couple pillars of that storyline but not much else, and I think that is one of the reasons it got so much hate. I don't understand why some people get so hung up on what they think a movie should be, and can't just enjoy something that may be unexpected. If you have seen any other Guy Ritchie films, and enjoyed them, you will instantly recognize his film making style here with quick cuts, zoom ins, great music, and overall a very fun tone. I do get dizzy in shaky camera sequences as those in Paranormal Activity, but I was completely fine for this film as everything was very smooth. The supporting characters would all be at home in cockney London, and that adds a certain flair to the fantasy setting which departs from archetypes you might typically see. There is extensive use of CGI but it all seemed to fit in with the style of the film as well. I'll say the final battled seemed a bit cheesy but other than that everything made sense to me.Overall if you have been considering this one or are a fan of fantasy at all, I'd highly encourage you to look past the negativity and check it out for yourself, it is highly entertaining.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
741,deenasan,Loved the flick,10,11 June 2017,"I have seen it twice and it was still fun to watch. I hope there are sequels. The scenery is fascinating regardless of whether it is real or CG. The special effects/fight scenes are imaginative, rather unexpected from my perspective. The funny parts are not forced, just funny because being funny at the time is what would be normal...ha, hope that made sense because I am trying not to write any spoiler stuff. There are some plot twists that I didn't see coming and that's always refreshing. I loved all the actors' work in this film.I am so puzzled as to why it didn't do better at the box office. But, I did my part and went to see it twice :) Just go and see it for the fun of it, because that's what summer movies are all about, fun!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

744,doggieluvr-50997,Missfortune led to a return,5,14 August 2017,"Backstory behind my movie experience: Basically I went to borrow the newest King Kong movie and, as it turns out, someone at the store didn't pay close enough attention, like me, and put King Arthur behind a King Kong movie case. Instead of going back, my folks and I decided to give it a shot.We got about 40 minutes in and had to return it. Not only was my father annoyed with the story telling but my mother was too bummed about not seeing King Kong. Also, the disc was starting to bug out for too long for them. Personally, I didn't think it was all that bad. The graphics were great and the characters were well designed However, the story was very confusing and hard to follow. Then, the ""growing-up"" time lapse was very forceful, too fast, and had key elements that could have helped build Arthur's character and the story. After that, when the three men were ""explaining"" what they did to the vikings, the ""comedy"" and speed of the explaining was really annoying and headache inducing. We got to the king talking with Arthur in the jail cell and that's where we ended it. I wouldn't have minded seeing a bit more, but my parents sure couldn't. Pros: The graphics were stellar. The characters were well designed and so was the landscaping. The first fight was very impressive and the music during the battle was perfect. Also, I can't forget..... GIGANTIC ELEPHANTS!!!! Very much a pro in this film for me!Cons: Story was poorly scripted and difficult to follow. Important story telling to build up a character's back story was skipped. And a headache causing scene with men trying to explain themselves ""beating up""(?) some vikings.PS - While I like the idea of him being grown up, it doesn't fit the ""Boy King"" title and he now suddenly doesn't have a wizard for a mentor. Boooo!!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

746,nhgodfre,King Arthur and the Inconsistent jump cuts,3,28 June 2017,"Jeez was this bad. Its been a long time when I had trouble watching a movie because of shitty camera angels and editing. It felt like every 5 Minutes there was a straight 60 Seconds of Trailer Bait that bounces between current time and montage. If you think that this review is pointless watch this hot mess and tell me you can keep up with the camera jumping to a new angel every 6 seconds. Seriously just keep the camera still when its on a low/calm part of the movie no one cares how many angels of a table or fire pit you can get, most people just want to concentrate on what is going on.I can sorta forgive the plot for being something completely different to a King Arthur story but man Leaving out Merlin is a Sin.Also the hell is this ""Breathing Music"" at an hour and ten minutes in?I thought my dog was hyperventilating till I figured it was part of whatever they called music for 5 Minutes.Big Takeaway, don't bother with this movie in theater or at home unless you have some friends to make it bearable.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
747,From_Lethe,Truly epic,10,20 June 2017,"When I saw a trailer of this movie in the cinema a few weeks ago I sat there speechless and with goosebumps already - the whole thing seemed too promising to me: the music coupled with such amazing special effects, Jude Law acting as one of the very main characters, Guy Ritchie being the director of the movie - I had a feeling it'll come out as something incredible.I saw this movie today by pure accident to be honest, I planned on doing it just a bit later in the future, but hell, I'm so glad it happened like that instead. What can I say - I came out dazzled. This movie outgrew my expectations, and outgrew them greatly. I can't name one thing that I don't like about it, really, and that's a new one for me. A perfectly measured portion of humour and seriousness - both shawls remained balanced throughout the whole movie. And oh, the moral that comes at the end is such a brilliant closure. As for me there's no other option than to grace this movie with ten stars and encourage everyone who still doubts if it's worth a try to just go on and watch this masterpiece - pretty much a drive without a clutch, I'm telling you.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

This movie far exceeded my expectations and is absolutely one of my favorites of 2017. Arthur was very true to form for Guy Ritchie with the London underground being the setting. I love the style which was very reminiscent of his earlier work. The cast was amazing, Jude Law was a great villain and Charlie Hunnam an amazing Arthur in a style not seen before. Go see it. You won't regret it.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
749,bodybrian,Excellent use of time-lapse and humor,8,14 May 2017,King Arthur: Legend of the Sword achieves what many in its genre fails to do. To give the hero a memorable and interesting background story without using an hour of screen time.King Arthur's childhood and upbringing is beautifully captured in a quick time-lapse that gives the audience all the information needed and an understanding of how Arthur was shaped. This alone made this movie standout from its peers.The use of humor and great acting is the polish for this movie-gem.

750,dpdone,Entertaining,5,14 May 2017,"There are mixed reviews on this movie and some critics go as far as giving it a 1 star. Even though the plot is predictable one has to say why am I going to the movies. Entertainment and in an nutshell this movie is very entertaining from beginning to end. I liked the way they told the story even though we know what is going to happen. A mixture of drama and with sword fights and a delightful dose of humor, you know a movie is good when you say you can watch that one again. Charlie Hunnan and Jude Law are outstanding in their roles. The Mage played by Astrid Berges is mysterious and at first we are not sure if she is good or evil then the relationship between Charlie and her becomes evident. I have never seen Charlie Hunnan before but am looking forward to seeing him in another action movie. He reminded us of a younger version of Brad Pitt but buffed out. Watch the trailer and if you like the trailer go see the movie . There is some profanity and one F-bomb. which surprised me because I am sure that word did not exist and that was the only negative portion of the movie for me although it was funny.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

It is Guy Ritchies version of the story, and it is awesome! OK, I went in there with the preconceived notion that it was not like the original and I already hated it. I was paying at the line and I was hating this movie already. I only went to see it because my son wanted to see it and he did not see the version I saw from the 80's. I was dogging this movie every chance I could. I was saying things like ""Arthur was not a bad-ass! Why is this guy walking with all that swagger?"" What melted my cold icy heart towards this movie was I saw that it was a Guy Ritchie movie. OK, I love Guy Ritchie movies, I really do, and still I wasn't giving movie a chance, but I decided to accept it and just watch it for what it was, a movie about King Arthur and Excalibur. Am I glad I did, wow this movie was crazy awesome! It's Guy Ritchie's version of King Arthur and Excalibur. I am a fan. If you like Guy Ritchie movies, you will love this one!

That morning I read some of the strongly negative reviews. I decided to keep them to myself as to not undermine anticipation of seeing the movie for my family. The entire movie I waited for it to get bad or fail me in some way. It never did! The movie was captivating, exciting and magnificently filmed in a style that brought you into the picture itself. Everyone loved it, the audience stood up and applauded! My thoughts are what is wrong with the CRITICS! Their pompous, negative and condescending reviews of this movie almost kept me from seeing it on the big screen. The special effects were wonderful. Do the critics no longer feel the pulse of the audiences out there? For example they said The Lobster was a masterpieceif you have seen it you know what I am talking about. I suggest if you are fantasy fans, go see this movie in the theater, do not wait for videoyou will be cheating yourself out of a great film experience.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

He's extremely unconvincing as a skilled swordsman king, that Ritchie used CGI in 70% of the fights (would be better a whole movie in CGI). Also, after he holds Excalibur, he becomes a Goku-like berserk, unskilled though, just swinging the sword frenetically, wooushh woooush, like he was a kid on a kid fight, completely laughable.Arthur Pendragon: aka British Goku, the story of the little boy is told in 5 minutes, spat and vomited in a chronological cut-scenes. Some teaching suffering for him and then, he's shown as a grown Arthur leader of a mafia street boys group, or something like that.The dialog: like Snatch... holy freaking sh*t... a prime masterpiece garbage. Sadly, the original tale of King Arthur is a romantic piece, nevertheless, no one has obligation to follow the original atmosphere of the tale, but this was out of limit of nonsenseness. A disconnected dialog occurs in the middle of the film, lasting like 10 minutes, boring and unfunny... anyway... adds nothing, like everything else, it's just threw up, it is indeed like a storyteller is telling you a story by vomiting it in your face.Characters: everyone is weak as a character, masked with a lot of extremely exaggerated CGI and *pooof* everyone become super saiyan, overpowered and all this crap.The Nemesis: The worst, Mordred is a mage, from India, summons giant elephant mages in Britain (that's insanely imbecile). Plus, Guy Ritchie transformed Voltigern into a Nazi leader with nazi salutation, holy crap... just no, man, that's weak. He sells the soul of someone he loves to a fat squid-medusa-like woman and then becomes The Reaper, like everyone in this movie, a skinny guy becomes something huge instantly.The mages (no Merlin though): just a girl with animal manipulation. She summons giant things too, and like everything else, no answers to questions like why and how. No Merlin, no other mage, just this girl called Mage... no Morgaine Le fay, no Guinevere, no Isolda, no Mourgause, the main female character has no name...Sincerely, I don't know how these people make money, they have to protect themselves on their jobs, because a film like that had to get everyone unemployed by incompetence, the only one that would maintain his job would be the CGI guy.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
754,iurimb,Excellent Proof of great modern cinematography and storytelling,8,21 June 2017,"Compelling and original way to tell an old folklore story (don't know much about the old story) Excellent and original visuals and special effects. Believable and well developed characters and their personalities, strong compelling display of emotions followed by a fantastic array of great actors. If you've never heard much about the legend and I never have , you will probably enjoy this one a lot more. One particular scene jumps to my eyes, the one where Arthur's father carves the sword on his own back , killing himself, which in turn he becomes the stone which holds the sword, very Creative and interesting way of telling this particular detail about the legend. Seeing all those hateful , negative reviews out there makes my eyes bleed, this movie deserves proper recognition and some respect for the people who thought it out and developed it, now I will give it an 8 because I felt like there could still be more in the movie, something else, more Creative and I think the story needs to go deeper and there's other options to explore which is not up to be, but to the creators.

Normally it takes me a while to get drawn and gripped into a movie. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) had me at the playful humor. A humor that is not often seen in movies these days. Artfully thought out and written into the story line. It was not dumb witted nonsense that is often brought out in movies. There are subtle things that they put into the movie, that was the cherry on the cake. If one knows a few things about history and nature, it is easily picked and noticed and adds value to the movie. The special effects were well done and impressive, giving the movie a mind blowing feel to it.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

""How the hell did the mage who can only control animals suddenly make a giant castle sized snake?"" ""Does Eric Bana only take cameos now?"" ""Where da romance yo?"".

It was fresh and engaging and I am glad I chose this movie to watch tonight instead of the GOT season 8 premiere. No way I'd be half as impressed by the cinematics and the storyline.It sickens me that people rave about lazy sequels and factor-farmed superhero movies which are all alike and forgettable, while original creative works such as this don't even make the box office.I'd rather see this story continue than yet another Marvel or Star Wars movie.

Several fights look like early 2010s videogame cut scenes... but that's not the only thing that makes a movie.Between a killer score that blends classical and traditional instruments with a unique modern heaviness, and a decent amount of creativity, you've got yourself a decent film.Does this depiction of Arthur seem a bit like a medieval Macklemore? Yeah. For sure.
It's not my favorite representation of him. But he's at least *different* from all the rest of them.Could he have been a bit more emotional, more forward with his emotions on-screen? Sure. But is that fitting of a kid who grew up in a brothel, on the streets, or in the gutter? Not really.Those people tend to be cynical at best and about as direct as a knife between the 3rd and 4th ribs. They dont have the time or energy to joke around - they just wanna get it done.On top of which, it's not meant to be a big touchy-feely film. It's action and fast-paced the whole time. As someone who isn't big on the legend of King Arthur, I knew enough to stay in the loop.The addition of a mage in the place of Merlin...? Who cares?And to anyone who says that they added a black character to be PC, you're an idiot. Believe it or not, black people have existed longer than your bleached (and mine) and were travelling beyond their ""home continent"" long before your more recent relations did. The sight of a single black man in Europe wouldn't have been unusual. They did have legs, horses, carts, and even boats back then, which made travel much easier over long distances.

This movie touched your heart.

People complaining about large elephants or astraying from the original story line should get a life. The meaning of a film/movie is the existence of powers or imagination that is not possible in real life. If you are still stuck in your childhood aura of the legends you have read as a story then this movie is not for you but if you are craving for something that satisfies your love for fantasy and history at the same time, then it's the best movie ever. While searching for the reason of it's loss in terms of cost clearly shows that American critics and cinemas were biased towards the movie. You can do your own research though. I loved it.

One of the best movies I have seen in many years!! If you do anything this year it's see this outstanding movie!! It had me on the edge of seat and completely captivated me every second of the film. Now what kind of movie can do that!! The explosive action and the amazing scenery was the best I'd ever seen. I loved when Arthur said ""cheers"" in the beginning. It gave me a wee laugh.

772,hillkristen-62899,This was a completely underrated movie!,9,17 July 2020,"I was never a fan of SOA, and honestly barely got through the first season. So, at first this movie didn't really grab my attention. I had heard it was long, and you had to pay attention to it. I, however, have a very short attention span, and it is very rare with a movie can grab my attention like this. There's only a handful of movies this long and soooo unbelievably interesting, which includes titles like The Dark Knight, Good Fellas, and Casino. When I finally decided I was going to try to watch this movie, I wasnt expecting much from it. I quickly realized that I was beyond wrong. I have an odd range of movie and tv genres for a woman, but this movie by far exceeded my expectations. It is one of my favorite handful of movies to watch, and I never get tired of it. With my short attention span, and this movie being able to grab my focus, proves that this movie is extremely underrated. I've seen the lists of the top King Arthur movies, and I never understand why this movie is either not listed or at the end of the list. No, it may not be your typical King Arthur movie, but that's what makes this movie so great. With titles such as Charlie Hunnam, Aiden Gillen, Eric Bana, Jude Law, and so much more, the casting was PERFECT. As I said, I did not care for SOA, and really didnt expect the perfection that came from his performance in this movie. I was so intrigued the whole time with how well his performance was in this movie. I swear, I have easily watched this movie at least 7-10 times, and still enjoy every bit of it. It delivers a little bit of wittiness, and seriousness at the right moments. If you haven't watched this movie, I seriously recommend that you do.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Ritchie is in a league of his own when storytelling. So yes this movie was very good from Rotchies perspective. The plot isnt as horrible, I have seen horrible. At least this one kept me engaged in the movie and wanting to know more. I cant imagine it being easy telling a story with flashbacks but Ritchie does it well.

The story lumbered on stopping each time for a spot of cockney humour. It reminded me of all the banter in a pub between gents. In addition to the cockney humour David Beckham pops up and tries acting which unfortunately not convincing enough. He's better sticking to what he knows best, football and aftershave. The haircuts were to modern and the clothing to Savile Row. Sorry Guy but Sherlock Holmes was better. Sherlock Holmes was entertaining and had a better story. Please no sequels of King Arthur.

The reviewers who give low scores clearly have issues with the producer which is fine, but don't spoil it for the rest of us. I gave it 10 because it entertains on so many levels.

Jude Law is worried about looking so out of place so he kills his wife because (a) he is jealous of her long black hair (b) if he wears his brothers crown it will hide his modern haircut (c) he can look mean moody and evil if he is on the throne all alone and not sharing it with his missus. After an argument with the king he takes over Camelot. To save the prince from being killed Baby Arthur is put in a rowing boat which has no oars but that's okay because it has magical ancient satnav. Ortur programmes the satnav to sail down the Thames to a nice little house with red lanterns where he knows beautiful women live ;) Luckily the beautiful women are washing out their smalls in the Thames when the boat arrives so they grab the luxurious fur blanket but there's a kid inside too! So they take the kid because they are fed up washing clothes in the river and they have a nice cuppa whilst everyone is watching the very boring and predictable montage of the prince growing up.

It's engaging with the perfect pace. Acting was great, story was fulfilling, and the quality (cgi, costumes, sets, etc.) was like if not better than most high budget films. I watched it again and enjoyed it even more picking up on little Easter eggs that I missed the first time. Example, there's a scene where they escape by jumping into a river off a cliff.

779,iwanselway-44180,A film that tries to sacrifice style over substance yet achieves neither,1,12 January 2020,"Akin to another member of English folklore, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword acts a little bit like Robin Hood. It steals your time and money, but instead of giving it to the poor, it gives it to Guy Ritchie - who I'm assuming has began to run out of money from his past successes like Snatch and Lock Stock, thusly this film is born.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a boring, stale, and turgid mess of a film. Not a 'so-bad-it's-good' type film either. The million dollar budget insures that the movie has all the hallmarks of a big blockbuster title; fancy effects and big names. But watch it for yourself and it's mask instantly slips - revealing a confused and convoluted film bound to leave you feeling unsatisfied and angry.Guy Ritchie's telltale style of witty British gangster types and quick-cut comedic dialogue sequences are lost on this film's half-baked historic/fantasy setting. Not even """"acting powerhouses"""" such as """"David Beckham"""" can pull this movie up from the pit of awful to that of mediocre. Never before have I seen a movie so unsure of it's own style.The plot barely exists, and when it does it's as lame as a stray dog. The entire film feels more like a vehicle for Guy Ritchie's new love affair with Charlie Hunnam rather than something that the audience wants to see. Most of the scenes are comprised of Hunnam being a witty, rugged, yet charming street-wise lad cutting about a strange detached version of medieval England. It's as if any one character from any of Guy Ritchie's previous films, or perhaps some kind of hive-mind amalgamation of the lot of them, has gone back in time to be a loveable rogue. It's repetitive, it's boring, it's void of any impact, and unworthy of remembering.Of course, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, and count myself one of the unlucky few who were tricked into seeing it by Guy Ritchie's previous stellar movies. Perhaps it's time we add Ritchie to the growing list of Directors fallen from grace. Time will tell.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The story is as unoriginal with so many cliches you could practically guess the events of the film. The typical rebel protagonist with his sad backstory and natural abilities. The evil power-hungry uncle. I was yawning by the first minutes and stopped watching halfway through. The humor was terrible and corny, I was cringing during most of the ""cool"" dialogue.

Also I appreciated the deep look at how past trauma plagues us in the form of fear. They were really many elements to enjoy in this film and yet for some reason it missed it's mark to be the masterpiece it could've been.

The men and women were equally two dimensional, unlikeable and vomiting lines we have been hearing since the 80s. They even managed to make magic dull. The little flickers of flashbacks and insights are poorly timed and sometimes comical unintentionally, they are like someone tapping you on the shoulder and whispering vital information that the writer forgot to include in the plot, but they're whispering to quick and you end up more confused.So you've got a movie that has nothing but empty cliches for characters, a plot that runs in circles getting nowhere and a style that tries so hard to be a modern adaptation you want to curl up in a ball of cringe and sob ""but...why?!"". Genuinely one of the biggest wastes of time and money in movie history.

786,csohl-85618,Don't miss this one! Definite spoilers ahead.,10,9 September 2020,"I'm definitely no professional movie critic, but I pretty much only watch movies. I've never been one to rely on critical reviews to choose what to watch or add to my collection. This movie is always in my short stack of movies to put in and set to repeat.
I've read reviews criticizing Charlie Hunnam 's haircut, whether the breed of dogs were around in the 6th century, the ethnic variation of the knights, the quality of the seams of the costumes, etc. There are many variations of the Arthurian legend, and frankly, I really enjoyed this one. No one really knows what type of haircut the mythical Arthur had, so I thinks that's pretty irrelevant. English mastiffs have been around for about 2,000 years and who really knows what they looked like in the 6th century. So, again, irrelevant. And well done hand sewn clothing has been around for quite some time also. Go figure. I'm really trying to figure out how any of that impacts this version of the Arthurian legend.
But moving on. I do admit that I was initially puzzled about King Uther losing the final battle with his evil brother Vertegren, since he did, in fact, have the magic infused Ex Caliber. When I finally got it, I felt a little stupid for not picking it up on the first viewing. King Uther did not lose. He protected his son for the future of Britain, (okay, it wasn't called England back then, but again, pretty much irrelevant). And he prevented his evil brother from having access or being able to use the power of the sword. Very relevant.I really wasn't familiar with Charlie Hunnam prior to this movie, but I thought he did a great job with Arthur.Jude Law is one of those actors that is easily recognizable. And yet he isn't. I've seen him in movies where he is wonderfully benevolent, and does it very well. And he seems overwhelmingly evil as Vertegren. And he is. But the anguish he displays as he murders his wife and later his daughter to ensure more power provides a glimpse of the tiny spark of humanity he retains. I really ceased to see him as Jude Law roughly 2 minutes into the movie. He just vanishes and Vertegren takes over. Just amazing.
So yeah, the knights seem to be kind of a mish mash on the surface. But they each bring their experience and talents to the ""table"", adding to the whole mystique of the Knight of the Round Table.
Yes, sometimes the pace is a bit frenetic, but the fight scenes seemed beautifully choreographed with slow motion and stop scenes. I really enjoyed the fight scenes.
On to the score. At times, the music is beautifully haunting. At other times, suspense building. But always evocative.
If you can't tell, I really, really enjoyed this movie. And you don't really need to go to the effort of suspending belief when it's a just a new interpretation of an ancient legend. So no belief required. Just enjoy!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

This story had been adapted to many movies and what else could be said? Well a lot it seems ....
First: the music - Had the movie been a failure I would say buy the soundtrack for it is great.
Second: the story - there was indeed much to tell and the way it was told was really great. Interesting with new angles to the story. Dialogues were simply waow.
Third: the acting - All actors were well picked. It was a pleasure to watch them. Depth of the characters were well displayed and I felt for everyone of them. Especially for Jude Law's villain when he kills in both cases his loved ones. He acts so well and the story is so well put that one feels sorry for his plight...
Fourth: Special effects - they were great, not too much, just what was needed.I watched it 5 times and would so again. Really all were good.That's what a great director, script and cast does to a ""regular"" story, it makes GREAT.Highly recommended.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

But 10/10, you're having a bubble - (incoming football analogy) - it's like knowing Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are 10/10 football players and then millions of people rating some geezer called Simone Zaza as a 10/10.Anything to declare?

Right from the beginning, I knew this wasn't a traditional King Arthur story. When the Guy Richie elements of heist planning with quick cuts and everyone having nicknames, I started to get into it more. But after those moments, the movie didn't follow through with the plans. It all didn't work together. I thought the production was sub-par as well. The movie seemed out of focus a lot, especially during the title credits. Not edited well. Just an all around poorly executed movie.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
803,almrose59,Worth a Look,10,14 May 2017,"This story is one that has been told so many times, so why do it again? But I loved this movie.. The soundtrack is great, the opening of the movie is wonderful and the darkness and special effects as well as the acting and HUMOR were excellent. I have discovered recently that directors really do make a difference to the end results. I have missed seeing Charlie in film. Jude played the bad man very well and David was an excellent bonus!!! I will buy this one to have at home..",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
804,burkemc-1,Misses the mark as a King Arthur tale,2,15 May 2017,"I went to this film with high hopes that it would return to the classic Arthur story line unlike the 2004 King Arthur film that tried to shoehorn the Camelot story into the late Roman Empire Britain.The Trailer was great with lots of action but like so many trailers the story as told in the movie fails utterly to capture the magic of the Arthurian Tale. If you take a step back and ignore the King Arthur story, the movie comes across as a good Sword and Sorcery tale with an Evil Wizard, Giant War Elephants, a Good King who sacrifices all for his family, an Evil King, A sword that mysteriously appears in the harbor, and a noble son who is orphaned and raised on the streets of Londinum. When the evil King begins rounding up males of a certain age to test them by making them try to draw the sword, our hero is revealed and has to escape to the wilderness. He returns to town with the help of a young female wizard, a couple of knights that served his father, a magic sword, and a few of his street rat friends to slay the evil King and regain his rightful place as King. It is only at the very end of the movie that any real references to the traditional Arthur story come up.The special effects and the fight scenes are great but they have a little to much of the slow motion feel that Guy Richie used in his Sherlock Holmes movies.So to sum it up go see the movie if you just want a good sword and sorcery flick but don't expect to see much of the Camelot classic tale.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

808,donebystan,Couldn't bother finishing it,2,11 September 2017,"I love Guy Ritchie, all of his movies. I expected so much of this movie since I saw the trailer. I start the movie and Eric Bana is great, the fx are great. I don't understand everything but hey, it's an action movie not a documentary. Then we see the life of the main character, that's when I start to loose focus. David Beckam shows up and I'm happy and I keep watching until the evil stepking reveals his plans but once the team ""new king"" is formed it starts to get boring. So boring I start playing clash royale and loose a couple of times. 15 minutes have passed and they are still talking, trying to do stuff with the sword, couple of flashbacks and I end it. I will try to watch it again and change my rating, but this movie is not meant to be funny like Snatch or Guy's previous movies, I expected battles and revenge... not that.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
809,indianmale_555,An audio-visually spectacular retelling of ancient legends,8,1 October 2017,"Guy Ritchie is a great filmmaker. His movies are fun, funny, visually intense (even when having no CGI), and the action is great. His presentation of the King Arthur legend has taken creative liberties in 'The Legend of the Sword', but those liberties add to the immersiveness of the experience. If you do not compare the storyline to the original story and just focus on this movie, it is mostly solid.The visuals are beautiful throughout the 2+ hours of the movie. Whether there are obviously computer generated graphics or pure human scuffles, the your attention won't waver from the screen.One of the interesting facets of the movie is the classic Guy Ritchie humour. It's fast and funny. They happen at unexpected moments of the movie. The soundtrack is fitting according to the action.Considering the usual Disneyish fantasy movies from Hollywood, it was cool see King Arthur not needing a love interest to bring some soul and emotion to the movie. The actions, good and bad, that the characters take, and their result, give you the emotional punch you need.I give this movie an 8 on 10 for a fun-packed, above average, and audio-visually entertaining retelling of ancient legends.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

812,clononey,King Arthur Done Right,10,28 May 2017,"Now THAT was King Arthur. I've seen a lot of complaints that this ""modern"" take on King Arthur wasn't done right, wasn't the traditional portrayal, wasn't your father's King Arthur (in a bad way), etc etc. But what Arthur HAS been done ""right""? For a character that's been done over and over, very few of the portrayals are of a King that lives up to his legend. I went into this movie with mixed expectations--on the one hand, critics were saying it sucked. But on the other hand, critics were saying it sucked. And we all know that ""professional"" critics tend to know nothing about fantasy and go into nearly every fantasy movie wanting to hate it. I even read one who said they felt that because Game of Thrones existed, audiences didn't need or desire any other fantasy stories. Uh huh. And because Starbucks exists, people don't need or desire any other coffee. Idiot. I expected the movie at worst to be crude and dumb, at best to be fun and entertaining. I didn't honestly expect to find exhilarating magic and a great script, to find Excalibur done right, to find Arthur done right. In the scads of Arthur films and shows that have been done, very rarely, IMO, has Arthur really been done ""right"". Sean Connery--but even that Camelot story wasn't really traditional given the lack of magic and any and all magical characters. Bradley James was pretty good. I honestly can't think of a single other Arthur I would follow into battle. But THIS is an Arthur I cheered for, I didn't cringe or roll my eyes at, didn't despise (thanks for that Once Upon A Time). This is an Arthur I would follow. Well done, Mr. Ritchie. But maybe next time don't release an action/battle/fantasy blockbuster on Mother's Day weekend.

Snakes like in Harry Potter, magical beings like in Beowolf and we could go on !!

First, I went into this movie thinking, 'Okay, so this chum Ritchie thinks he's going to make a King Arthur movie. Alright. I like Snatch! I like Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels! Let's see what's happening here."" Aside from the hyper-masculinity and the occasional montage of back story happening like story-telling, you're not going to be here for Ritchie. Sorry. Maybe two points for happening to almost be a 'Guy Ritchie' film. Moving on...Second, I figured, ""I like King Arthur! So that's cool! Maybe there's some cool fantasy stuff and Merlin is a pretty chill dude! There's at least going to be interesting character development! I mean it's a Guy Ritchie film after all"" HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Need I remind you, this is only 2 out of 10 a Richie film? YES! I DO! There's absolutely NOT ONE OUNCE OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! (And no Merlin? Really? Really really? Yes really... no Merlin.) Not to mention most of this story is just made up, hyper-masculine, fantasy-world, supernatural nonsense that's more suitable to the cheesy spin-off/mash-up of Lord of the Rings and 300 than a King Arthur movie.

The way they made the movie was different, new and it just made me wanting to go to cinema to see it again (and i am not that kind of a person who goes to cinema to see a movie he has already seen). The movie was also amusing. I liked the Arthur himself and I believe Charlie did great job being Arthur, it just fits him and i cannot imagine another actor playing Arthur.

So sorry, I want to find each one of them in here, come to their house, extend a hand of friendship as a gesture, and a warm hug, then be off on my way.Because way I see it, you have to be completely sad in your life and empty inside to not have enjoyed this film at the very least from an action flick spectacle side of things.Lets cut to the chase.Is it historical? No. Should anyone care? Again, NO!
I don't see anywhere in the process it trying to be a reference to history.And for all the peanuts out there and special snowflakes, the legend of Excalibur is not historical either. Its made up fantasy and folk lore. The actual story of some King Arthur was bland and boring by comparison.People sure like to whine that there are no good films out there in certain genres, then when they finally get some good films they get stuck on some silly complaint which is not even valid most of the time for said films.Its a modern fantasy rendition of a fantasy made up tale, told in a way to give you some twists and turns you would otherwise already know if the story was kept 100% to the original. It is not THE story of Excalibur, nor should it be, and is filled with a wonderful Ritchieness it deserves which in fact made it even better.The pacing was amazing, hardly ever boring, and thanks to such directing was able to say more in less time. I'd expect other directors to have a hard time to capture this rendition in even 2 and a half hours, which would indeed have been boring.The effects where simply wonderful, the story was relatively simple on the one hand, but with enough ""depth"" to it on the other, changing enough to make it new, keeping enough to respect the old.As for a the genre it was clearly aimed at, FANTASY, it done its job superbly and what a shame some people have peanuts for brains and it didn't get the praise it deserved.But Marvel films which are mind numbingly boring get 9/10 and make billions? (And have worse action and story too).On the one hand I am so sad this bombed as a film. It would have been great to see a sequel or if not for that, to have just made a profit. On the other hand, people don't deserve good films it seems. They deserve Transformers and idiocy. Thats all they are good for.8/10 from me. Easy 8/10. Not perfect, some very few things I would change, but everything else was top notch. Especially the quality of the film. Excalibur, the legendary sword of power, has never, ever, ever, been depicted before with such power and relevance to the protagonist (Arthur) and the land/plot.What a great creative rendition.

But therein also lies the weakest spot: wherever the story could really get emotional for the characters, either some kind of eventful action interrupts it before it even started, or some humor is used - as it seems, to circumvent other emotions.The action is well choreographed and has a its own great style - the fights sometimes resembling a scene from one of the Infinity Blade games, including slowdowns and skull- masked brutes. It is brought to the screen in an avalanche of aesthetically pleasing CGI, here and there mixed with quite okay acting performances, most prominently by Charlie Hunnam, but also by Jude Law and Astrid Bèrges-Frisbey.If you like action movies with humor and good timing, and maybe don't care all too much about all the emotions going on with the characters, this is a must-see.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Every important scene came from somewhere else. The escape to the woods smacks of Robin Hood, the gladiator school fight scene is from Gladiator, and worst of all the mage tower is an unabashed ripoff from Lord of the Rings.

The camera showed the history of the future king with a completely new perspective. Dialogues were ridiculous even mentioning them after watching the movie. Music that perfectly complements the story depending on the course of events. Little details through the movie constantly reminding you that you are watching a Guy Ritchie's work.

It was given a 6/10 because it has so much potential with it's great cast, huge budget, and even good music (parts). In an attempt to use fancy film tricks, the fantastic story of King Arthur and Excalibur is lost. They do this thing where there cut from the planning stage to the action, which can be a great thing and is even done well in the movie. BUT THEY DO IT SOMEWHERE AROUND 5 times! It gets annoying and old after doing the same thing over and over. I don't even mind the crazy embellishment of the story and the special effects aren't bad, that is until Charlie Hunnam fights a bunch of people in a matrix-like fight where Neo fights the multiples of the agent with a metal pole after talking to the oracle.

Personally I liked what he has done here, he's used a fresh, stylistic visual language to tell an old legend. He's very much striped outside the usual boundaries in this genre, which some won't like, but those of us open to new and innovative story telling will enjoy.. he's a capable story teller, and the acting is pretty reasonable throughout., I thought it was well cast and Jude Law was especially good as the villain of the story.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Guy Ritchie *sigh*OK let's give him the benefit of the doubt, surely he's grown up enough over the years to tell the story with the integrity it deserves. Surely he wouldn't super impose his cardboard cockney wit into such a legendary tale? Surely...ffs GuyThis is not Snatch or Lock Stock. The dialogue between the characters is embarrassingly cringe worthy, embarrassing because you can sense how Richie must think that this comic book cockney persona is so appealing it must be written into every character. It's not appealing, it's excruciating. The editing stinks of Richie's ego, his idea that every scene must confirm what a fresh director he is, but it's what makes him rotten. Richie's one dimensional characters are essentially the same person, all unrealistically interacting with each other with such painful artificiality. It has some great scenery, some what ruined by the out of place soundtrack, another of Richie's facepalm quirks. CGI's are impressive at times, but nothing Earth shattering. They suffer from the usual distracting weightlessness most other CGI's suffer. All in all a wasted opportunity for the audience and for Richie to show how he's matured as a film maker. And seriously, does Arthur's barber have a set of Whal hair clippers, or are we expected to believe his hair is perfectly manicured into unfitting style with a cut-throat blade?

This movie was great start to finish. Everything from the action scenes to the soundtrack was done very well. I would love it if this movie had further sequels.

But there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, a thrilling, wonderfully executed and thoroughly funny heist/action hybrid told with gusto in an Arthurian setting.And what a setting! One of the things I most love about the Arthurian myth is how it is told and retold in new and ever interesting ways, and how that's now been happening for, oh, 700 years or so. Ritchie expertly blends the familiar and the new, and kept me guessing and wondering, continuing this grand tradition.I want more!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
857,pmsl_23,Utterly common and forgettable...,3,17 July 2017,"Having the privilege of being acquainted with John Boorman's 1981 oeuvre ""Excalibur"" a few years after it was released, in Betamax, all arthurian theme related movies that i've seen thus far fall short in comparison, with the exception of Bresson's ""Lacelot du Lac""; which is perfectly normal given the bar set by Boorman's near to perfection interpretation of this tale. That being said it wasn't with high expectations that I went to see this movie, but whilst I never forgot Boorman's beautiful rendition of the arthurian myth 30 years past, that's not likely going to happen with this new itineration signed by Guy Ritchie. That being said and acknowledging that it's not fair comparing two interpretations that had different sights in sight, the truth is that when we rate something we do it by comparison with our own references; and by the high rating that this movie has it seems that the viewers don't have good examples to compare... While Boorman's romantic, classical, and erudite, borderline academic, ""Excalibur"" is a work of art that transcends time and genres, Guy Ritchie ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" is just an author movie with the stylish pacing, dialog scripting, and such other gimmicks that made him well known in such other ventures like ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"", but that don't work so well in this century old folklore tale as it did on his take of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. But even if we were to forget all the other great references that make this movie bad in comparison, just the movie itself comes short in all other departments: poor editing, bad and confusing script that's just a pastiche of several - all over the place - references (GOT meets Snatch and LOTR, everything but the classics), lack of development of the supporting characters (what did we got know of Astrid Bergès-Frisbey character ""the Mage"", that has a significant role in this movie?), and cheesy action scenes that make the sword prop more relevant in terms of narrative that the man who wields it (on this note just pay attention on the elegant role Excalibur plays on the defeat of Lancelot by Arthur in Boorman's adaptation that just shows what good storytelling is), are just a few examples on the several flaws I identified on this movie, and why I rate it so low. Of course that for those out there that don't know any better, and might prefer Kanye over Bach, this movie will certainly be somewhat entertaining, albeit not as much as other summer blockbusters that came out the same week; and if you feel it was worth your hard earned cash who am I to say otherwise, but even so one should be a bit more demanding about what we pay for and a movie with a production cost of roughly 175M.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

People going into this movie shouldn't be expecting something similar to the King Arthur films they're accustomed to. Guy Ritchie took the King Arthur character that everyone knows and turned him into someone like-able. This is the definitive King Arthur movie for a couple of reasons.The story isn't dense and boring. It focuses on a concise narrative which doesn't spoon feed history or plot details to a viewer. The story is happening through the characters, as it should in any good movie. Camera movement is fresh and provokes adrenaline. It's hard to look away. Something to consider. this is the first movie in a planned MCU like universe. Not a standalone movie.Bottom line - Go see this movie for yourself, if you're someone who loves looking at reviews. You can safely disregard them in this case.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

864,ignacio_tavera,Guy Riichie at his best! ...in the wrong place and time,5,18 May 2017,"Should you watch this film? That depends. If you are a millennial, under, let's say, 34, you will love it; and due to peer pressure, it is a must see. If not, well, unless you are a hardcore Guy Ritchie fan and know what you are in for, this won't deliver. I am a hardcore millennial Guy Ritchie fan.The good. It is quite an exciting ride, it has Ritchie's signature all over the place. From sly dialogue and cunning soliloquies that shower with cleverness, to action packed persecutions and beautifully choreographed combat. Art direction is superb, the movie is visually striking and the CGI and special effects are top notch, even in 3-D, alternating between open and long sceneries and slow-mo close-ups, well placed throughout the installment. Soundtrack is electrifying, simple and raw, adds a lot to the mood and rhythm of the scenes, building the right amount of tension and expectation. The cast is high caliber and performs well when CGI and fast paced editing allow them, so don't expect any award worthy drama. Editing and CGI are trademark of the house, no time is wasted with fast but natural transitions that fit the narrative. Setting and atmosphere are stylish and alluring, resembling Game of Thrones grandiosity, despite the lack of historical accuracy.The bad. The lack of plot. Story is as linear and predictable as you might get during the 2008 Hollywood writers' strike, regardless of the brief moments of tension that build up through Ritchie's own narrative and style. The good guy is good, because uhm he's a good lad, and he has royal blood in his veins so it's his destiny! The bad guy is bad, because he is greedy and envious, so you know he's bad. We have a severe case of 'the chosen one no matter what'. I knew that from the trailer, you know that from the classic Arthurian cycle, but there was no character development nor innovation at all in this telling. There are no real obstacles to overcome, only smoke and mirrors. Now that being said, no matter how good your direction and all the other props are, if the plot is forced with convenient coincidences and Hollywoodesque timing, all you get is a two hour childish consumer product at best. It feels like a Disney princess' movie for guys. It sure was fun, but I am also sure in 10 years this movie will be remembered as Guy Ritchie's weakest link in the chain.That's it. The review is over, so you can skip the next part where I rant a little more about its historical inaccuracy and why, no matter how I knew beforehand how it would turn out, I still was let down. First, I evidently understand that Ritchie intended a freer re-telling, however, key elements of the Arthurian cycle are barely incorporated, there is little Merlin, Morgana, or Lady of the Lake. The script parts so often from the canon that we end up with more of a gang war movie than a medieval romance. Now, this bothers me more than it should, but there is a huge anachronism in the setting and atmosphere that does not seem intended. The tale of King Arthur should be set somewhat between the V and the VIII centuries, where vassal relations with the king had a contractual nature. All that omnipotent tyrant ruler that employs slaves and crudely subdues the free people, is nothing more than an ideological and lazy cliché for the sake of the plot (or its absence thereof) that does not contribute or innovates in any artistic or moral way. Language, manners, architecture, warfare, all is wrong. I know, I know artistic liberties, this is an action-fantasy flick. But it fails to deliver the syncretic and surrealist feeling of similar approaches made by Orson Wells in Macbeth, Zack Snider's 300, or Baz Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet. It does not feel cheap, but it pales as hurried in comparison. Why would you waste your time with apologetic pieces of trash like Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter or Pride and Prejudice and Zombies? This feels more like those, even if I haven't seen them.It also seems critics have been soft with Ritchie because he is a homeboy, he is British. Audience has abided because his previous work is thrilling. But more people would have gone full berserk on any outsider making a similar movie, for instance Zack Snider or Quentin Tarantino would have gotten worse reviews for ignoring the canon or casting non-British actors. Don't get me wrong, I am all in favor of inclusive castings, but the Kung Fu dojo was like Fonzie jumping the shark.All in all, I hope we don't end up with a franchise out of this more like a spin-off of medieval literature. We have Game of Thrones for that matter. And also hope that Guy Ritchie will keep developing his style, rather than awkwardly repeating himself, or forcing his vision where it does not fit, without getting proper advice from an expert consultant.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

It seems as if the director put all of his money in the first half an hour of the movie, and it kinda goes downhill from there. If you like the story of Camelot and King Arthur, then I suggest watching Excalibur(1981), Merlin(1998) the mini series with Sam Neil, or even the cartoon, The Sword in the Stone (1963).

When you say ""Ok, I will buy this story and stay with it till the end"", cause Ritchie has this ability to make this for you, like in his other movies, you will finally buy the story and their characters. But you will also wait for some magical scenes, and when they come it's like you could not enjoy them! The cinematics are too fast, you rationally understands what is happening, of course, but you couldn't enjoy, it's a shame. But you stick with the characters and the story, and waits for THAT scene, you know THAT scene that will do a turnover in the story, Ritchie is preparing it for you, you almost can feel it coming, and then... the movie is over (you will notice the movie is over and the final act it's just for fill some curiosity), you leave the place with some disillusion, you not saw a bad movie, but you not saw a very good one too.Resuming: It's a good movie, with good rhythm, nice scenes, British humor (which I particularly love), some poor character development (not bad in the movie, it's like more of a style adopted by Ritchie) and a new point of view of something so popular.

Too bad computers can't generate a plot.Going in, I thought perhaps the poor reviews were due to the disconnect between the legend of King Arthur and this modern take. Not so. When people say ""there's no plot,"" this is not an exaggeration. There's also no character development of characters that are already flat as a board. The acting is good of course - I wouldn't have seen this if it didn't have some great actors in the roles -- but they have nothing -- worse than nothing! -- to work with. To add insult to injury, Arthur himself is the modern anti-hero that 12-year old boys are drawn to. The fact that he hoarded money is supposed to show us that he has potential for power (ummm, what?). His character is moronic and selfish, and imagining this man being a legendary leader makes my head hurt. Folks, try this exercise: instead of it being a beautifully sculpted blond young man spouting those lines, pretend he's an aging, balding man with an unattractive face and a potbelly. Does the character still shine through? (It's sort of like they took watered down lines that got rejected from Deadpool - a movie I love, btw - and popped them into this script).Don't waste your money. Seriously, you'll regret it. I never write reviews, and this is how angry I am that I wasted money seeing this trash.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
880,antunmod,Unwatchable,2,25 June 2017,"I have created an IMDb account just so I could share my opinion on this movie. I don't know what kind of a movie production this is, but it is just horrible. There are too many cuts, too much loud music, half of the movie looks like a trailer, the jokes are quite bad and it just completely missed the whole point. By a lot. I really wanted to watch it till the end, but I had to stop after an hour to stop wasting my time. I would highly recommend watching something other than this.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

It is something new, something different . Part of the problem people will have with this movie is the casting of Hunam. He is a great actor , trying to make his mark on the big screen . Everyone is all caught up on his role in SoA and just wanna keep him in that bubble. He takes his roles seriously and does a great job at this",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
883,rachelhancock-33325,Not Bad But Could Have Been Better,5,21 May 2017,"My boyfriend and I went to see this movie today. I went in with a lot of excitement. I wasn't completely disappointed, the score, visuals, and the actions scenes were great. But two things really bothered me: how distorted they got the legend and how I didn't know any of the character's names. Now I know that in order to make a movie interesting for modern day you have to change some things in the legend, and that's fine. But killing off my favorite Arthurian character in the first 10 minutes and making him completely different wasn't a good idea. Not to mention they never even introduced: Morgana, Gwen, Lancelot, or Merlin (when they said they would). And those are some of the more interesting characters if you didn't want to just focus on Arthur. Second, half way through my boyfriend led over to me as a character was talking and asked me who he was. This was a character that had been with Arthur from the beginning and we had maybe heard his name one, so by the time he's whole death scene came along I didn't feel anything because I didn't even know his name! My boyfriend would like to add that they waited too long to try and humanize Jude Law with the death of his daughter (whatever her name was, she said it once and then never again). If they wanted people to fill more weird pity towards him they should have shown he's love towards her a lot sooner.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

I didn't really know what to expect, but the fast paced, character- switching dialogue works really well with the way this film depicts King Arthur. This is not a 'by the book' retelling, but because it is done well, it is definitely a welcome change. The story line is choppy at parts, but only because there is little time wasted on the lore you already know and love. The original ideas added to this story are done very very well, both plot-wise and visually. The characters are everything you would expect from Ritchie... He really knows how to construct an engaging bad-ass, while still revealing little about the character. The fight scenes were spectacular! I did not expect to like this flick as much as I do, but those are often the best movies. I am genuinely excited for the next one.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

Otherwise if you enjoyed Guy Ritchie's take on Sherlock Holmes and like fantasy this movie is great.

Guy Ritchie has once again impressed me with his unique storytelling abilities. It was refreshing to watch a re-imagining of a legend rather than a regurgitation of the same old story. I've heard that Guy intended for there to be six of these movies, it would be a shame if the opinion of a bunch of people whose profession it is to critique others while contributing nothing to cinemas themselves buried this series on us. See it, in 3D if you can ... Absolutely worth it.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

The movie has an amateur/indie vibe to it, even though the actors and effects are top of the line. The direction and scenery is pathetic compared to the production quality. I love the fantasy medieval scenes and the setting, but the story ruins it all. It's all black and white, there are things that are irrational and left unexplained ( in my opinion for anyone with average and above intelligence these stand out like trees in a field and just make me shake my head).

I loved this film! It was so much fun to watch from beginning to end and made the story of King Arthur much more interesting! The acting was well done and many of the actors are known for their roles in this fantasy genre. Somebody else stated it is like watching GOT, Lock Stock, and Lord of the Rings rolled all into one film and I'd have to agree with that. Give it a chance, it was really a lot of fun to watch and kept us engaged the entire time.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

I probably would've just changed out the mage. The rest did a great job. I literally can watch this movie over and over again. I wish it would've done better in the box office.

893,crystalrain-29893,"Hugely underrated by critics, this movie deserves better",9,30 May 2017,"So, I don't usually write reviews, but having gone too many so-called critics bashing this movie, I had the need to say my own view. This movie is actually becoming a case, as it has an awful 28% on Rotten Tomatoes against a 80% audience score, and the same here. I saw critics bashing the ENTIRE movie just for the David Beckham cameo... There must be something else between the critics environment and Ritchie... The movie is not perfect, sometimes is too quick, looking like a trailer or a music clip, and probably some CG based action sequences have too much weight into the plot, yes, it's all over the place in some aspects. BUT, and there is a big but, it's a MUCH NEEDED fresh take on the same old story of King Arthur (you may look at it like a Batman Begins version of the well know story). Jude Law is... well, he is perfect for the role. Photography, although CG based sometimes, is brilliant, the soundtrack is epic and modern at the same time. Ritchie's style is there, with his flashbacks, ""he said that - i said that - she said that"" style that give the movie pace and rhythm (maybe too much in some aspects, like I was saying before). But overall is an entertaining movie, that very well deserves a sequel to close a lot of the plot elements left open. I'm giving one point more to counterbalance the ""professional"" critics bias on it that is undeserved.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

It has fun with its own premise, which makes it hyper enjoyable for the audience. There is some great primal folk elements in there for good measure. The reaction from critics almost seems suspicious. They have pretty much killed this one for people, destroying chances of sequels. Hopefully when all that comes out is copy paste Marvel films, they will feel terrible. Film critics, what are they for? Taste setters? How is that possible when they are clearly so out of touch. Its a film that blast's along at a pace. The cinema was roaring with laughter in the many enjoyably non-serious moments. You also get a hilarious cameo from Guy Ritchie, as a confused property owner.

895,nehswarup,A one time watch,7,16 May 2017,"The story of King Arthur and Excalibur has been retold many a times over the years. Like every other director, Guy Ritchie to has tried to bring to life the glory of an era gone by. The story being a in itself is fast paced which ensures that the audience isn't going to fall asleep. The characters are sketchy and could have definitely been explored more. Arthur's reluctance to accepting his destiny is downright annoying and then in the blink of an eye, he's the people's saviour. The tongue in cheek humor falls flat and really wasn't required. The extensive CG work alone could not take the movie forward and more attention should have been paid to other areas. All in all, the movie could have had a lot more scope and I don't suggest it if you've had a long day and want to watch something",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

897,siimlahe,Why all the bad reviews?,10,21 November 2020,"My thoughts:This movie is great, i love the soundtrack it has, i love the acting and i love CGI.
This is one of these movies that utilizes a character from a legend and usually when they remake somekind of a legend movie or such i dont like em, but this one actually is great.
What you find is the Hero Arthur, Magic and character development.
Another thing that i love is that when Arthur and his friends collect the money it gives off like one of these New Yorkish mafia / gang era vibes which is i love for some reason.
Also its not fairytale styled movies that we nowadays see, its more rough, You dont see main character being raised in a brothel in a disney movie do ya.
Charlie Hunnam is a actor i previously only saw on Pacific Rim and i had no clue who he was, but after i did my research on the movie and saw that he is the same actor from Pacific Rim i am glad they gave him a another great movie to do, he does this movie a justice with his amazing acting.
Ive watched this movie now for the 4th-5th time and it never bores me.Rating:Soundtrack: 10/10
Acting: 10/10
Story: 8-9/10
CGI: 8 / 10Conclusion:
As i said before its an amazing movie, unfortunetly due to ratings it will never have 2nd movie eventhough i wish for it.

902,connorashpole,Badass re-imagining of the legend King Arthur,8,5 September 2017,"Yes, this is a ""remake;"" I mean, we all know the Legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. But to me it's more of a re-imagining of the Legend of King Arthur through the eyes of Guy Ritchie. Something I never knew I wanted. But damn has he made this legend into a very compelling film. It's obvious Guy takes pride in the small, seemingly insignificant details and edits throughout a film. He makes a typical, obvious edit of story told by a few of the characters into something enticing you further into the realm of King Arthur. His work in creative narrative through interesting edits is outstanding. I've always been a fan of Ritchie; and for him to solidify his talent in such a hard genre to succeed in amazes me.We all know the basic(basic(basic)) story. But that doesn't matter. Everything else is a gold mine in this film. I'll get past the impeccable editing and directing. The casting was great. Charlie Hunnam is an epic Arthur, not to mention Aidan Gillen, Neil Maskell, Kingsley Ben-Adir playing great roles supporting him at any cost. The supporting characters made this film as much as any. And finally, Djimon Hounsou as Bedivere involved a great performance. As for the mysterious mage played by Astrid Bergès-Frisbey, she impeccably played her part in the story (if only for a little bit longer).If you like innovative cinematography. Or Guy Ritchie (one in the same). Or King Arthur. Give this a viewing. You won't be disappointed.Cons: Jude Law. A protagonist is only as powerful to the audience as the antagonist is. Solid C for Law's performance, I'm a Law fan, but this is ONLY part of the film that felt off (nit-picking).",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

There were certain parts that seemed pointless to me and some oddities, if you may, here and there, but overall it was nice. Jude Law was a delight. Charlie was good, too. The ladies were also a strong point. The actors did a really good job and I also liked how everyone looked the part. Pleasant visuals, although most special effects felt really Zack Snyder-y (I heard that's also this director's style (I'm not into it)).To make the long story short, the film is good.

904,matezajkas,"Good try, but shockingly disappointing.",3,11 February 2018,"I really don't know who or what to thank that i didn't see this movie in the theaters. I never saw this movie until today but i feel like i did like a thousand times. I like Guy Ritchie's works, also i am not really familiar with the arthurian tales, but to compare this pile of nonsense to Lord of the Rings is unbelievably anger inducing.I really don't get why people give this 6+ stars, it could only go up so high if you dismiss all the factors that makes this hunk of crap what it is and you are left with Guy Ritchie's name and the music. Which were the only redeeming qualities. I can only think that, like everywhere, shills walk among us.
Let's get to the story, shall we?Oh boy... even with the limited knowledge i have about the original story and the roughly 2 minute research i made after the movie, i can say with confidence that this is not a remake of any sort. What was wrong with romans? I get it, an other movie where you have to brute force nazi-like imagery to make the bad guy a bad guy because you don't have enough time to write depth, but why change the romans to ninjas with unpractical metal masks? Oh yeah... so deep and original.
All of this reminded me of 300, but at least that movie was entertaining and from beginning to end was fully meant to be fictional and was also out of it's mind. This was a weak attempt to take Snatch and place it in medieval times. And it failed miserably.But again, even if you are now a die hard fan of this movie and find it entertaining, giving it 9-10 stars? You are saying this movie is better than Reservoir dogs, Goodfellas, even Snatch and LotR? If yes and still maintain this opinion, you should consider taking changes in you life and talk to people who are from flesh and bone, they can help.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

907,cwtwicks,Good film with a few things that let it down.,8,21 May 2017,"Maybe my perception of this film was coloured by the fact that I had built it up to much in my own mind. As a massive fan of Guy Ritchie and King Arthur, I could not wait to see this film. I'll start with what I enjoyed most about the film. The soundtrack was amazing and gave it a constant sense of epic-ness. It was well-written, the plot mostly well-paced (a little slow at times) and different from the usual King Arthur stories that are around. The acting was mostly good and the setting was amazing. One of few things that let this down was the Mage's acting, there was almost no emotion in her voice or face when she delivered lines. Most of the cinematography was good but there were a few points where it went way over top, at one point it was so crazy that not only did I not know what was happening but it started to give me a headache. Finally, one of the things that is great about Guy Ritchie is his ability to weave different stories together to create a masterpiece and King Arthur seemed a little to linear, maybe that is why the film seemed to plod at times. Overall, good film and would recommend seeing even if only for the epic soundtrack.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

910,afraccica-82849,This was certainly a Guy Ritchie film,6,28 January 2019,"Dialogue- Ritchie used the dialogue to move the story and provide exposition. One way he does it is by the characters ""telling a story"" to the others and flashbacks lending extra details. He uses a quick editing technique that is reminiscent of movies like Snatch and Lock Stock. I happen to like it, but I think he over used it. The dialogue also pulls you out of the setting because the characters speak colloquially in modern terms and many had nicknames like Flat Nose Mike. It reminded me vaguely of A Knight's Tale.
Spoilers
Story- This movie seemed like a mishmash of Jesus Christ, Moses and Batman. Arthur sees his mom and dad get killed, by his uncle, like Batman. He gets sent off on boat down a river and is raised by a surrogate family, like Moses. He ends up in a far off land, sort of, learns fighting skills, haunted by the deaths of his parents, goes back to where he was born, and helps save his people, like Batman.
Arthur lives a private life before he takes on the responsibility of the sword, what he was born to do.
Vertigern, like King Herrod?, Begins a search of similar aged boys and tests them out on removing the sword from the stone. Similar to the killing all first born sons. Vertigern was trying to ferret out Arthur from his private life.
When Arthur was taken to the executioner stage, one if Vertigern's lackeys starts addressing the crowd saying here is your born King. He taunts Arthur by asking him to prove himself by taking the sword and showing everyone. He did everything but put a crown of thorns on Arthur's head. Very similar to when Jesus was standing trial.Tl:;dr- this movie is incredibly derivative of some well known stories, with some King Arthur stuff mixed in.Music- I really liked it. The song about the knightshade was harrowing and really set the mood for when Arthur set out to kill his uncle and take the throne. A lot of drums and deep bass.Characters- some were fleshed out. Jude Law's Vertigern was pretty solid. He did a good job demonstrating his thirst for power. Charlie Hunnam's Arthur was alright, but his modern portrayal clashed with Law's more traditional portrayal. Arthur's crew were funny and entertaining but you never really got to know any of them well enough. I think GooseFat Bill was the most interesting. The Mage was pretty. And she was pretty one dimensional.All in all it felt like I was watching Snatch set in an Arthurian legend and I was left wondering where was Jason Statham",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

No spoilers you've probably seen those elephants in the trailer. I'd rather have had more time with the cast, some of whom are under-utilised. On the positive side the dialogue crackles with humour, especially in the first third of the film, and the cast is peppered nicely with British character actors, and a certain footballer. Charlie Hunham is great and Jude Law is always watchable, but something is missing - principally a female lead. If I'm being nit-picky I'd add that the writers have made some unusual choices regarding some characters - things that don't exactly fit the mythology - but that is a minor point.

This is definitely NOT a chick flick, but I'm not holding that against it. ;) The occasionally witty dialogue made for some enjoyable lighthearted moments, giving the comic relief a battle-intensive movie needs.

But they seem to love to hate Guy Ritchie. It's almost international sport at this point. If you don't like Ritchie's signature style, the movie probably isn't for you. His mark is all over it, though it's a very different genre for him. It's a fresh take that breathes new life into an old legend. It's perfect for the video game generation. That's not a bad thing. I am a big fan of the Arthurian legend and all the movies and stories that have come before. This version doesn't take away from that. It's different and the Arthur origin story hasn't been done before. He's growing into his role as King. The editing, pace, sharp banter and bromances lighten some of the heavier moments and there are so many great scenes. And I can't say enough about Daniel Pemberton's score. It's a character unto itself and gives the film a medieval, modern, rock-and-roll edge. I was mesmerized and wasn't bored for a second. The film is visually dazzling, and I wanted to know more about these characters. I came into the movie with no expectations, other than I couldn't wait to see Charlie Hunnam on the big screen again. I'm a devoted Sons of Anarchy fan, and it surprises me that he isn't a household name yet. He brings so much to this role. He flat-out looks incredible. He already lights up any screen, but putting on 20 lbs. of muscle makes him look like a super hero. But he also brings depth to the role – not easy to do in a movie full of stars and big-time special effects. He's cocky, charismatic, but also vulnerable. A reluctant hero, who's not sure he's ready or willing to embrace his destiny. I want to know more about his relationship with the Mage, played by Astrid Berges-Frisbey. There's subtle sexual tension between those two, that hints at more. I read that she's supposed to be Guinevere, so I hope they make more movies. Jude Law has so much fun with his role and I liked his mix of swagger and shame. Djimon Hounsou and Aiden Gillen are fantastic, as well as the rest of the cast. You want to hang out with these guys and have a beer and you definitely want them fighting for you. The action scenes are big and over the top, but that's the fun of a Summer movie. It's no secret that Guy made a 3.5 hour Arthur film that he had to cut down to 2 hours. There's more story to be told. But that was the plan for multiple movies. Stupid critics are trying to ruin that. Don't listen to them. And if you want to see more of Charlie's range, check out Lost City of Z.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

We booked tickets to a dogs life and ended up in the wrong cinema but my two boys said to stay ;) We watched the movie totally riveted - action, heroes, bashing smashing and a plot that just kept us wanting more right to the end which we thought was a fantastic spin on the old legend and leaves plenty for a sequel! Absolutely brilliant and my boys said its one their ALL TIME favourites! No idea why it has got such bad reviews.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
923,mpawluk-49479,Very entertaining!,10,13 May 2017,"I can't remember a time I left the theater being this entertained. As far as movies go, with that goal, I believe King Arthur exceed it. Don't listen to the critics, and who wants another serious King Arthur movie anyway? This was a unique spin on the legend. Guy Richie has a true artistic talent. Very enjoyable, looking forward to more movies from him and the King Arthur world in the future.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
924,rajchanchalkhatri,Wasted time and money,2,13 May 2017,The main action part which audience is put waiting for since start of movie lasts no longer. Story was old too. Even Indian's Bahubali was much better. I enjoyed my pop corns more than the movie. They should have some suspense in movie if it's a power-of-throne like movie. From the start I knew what is gonna be in end!!,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
925,francislogullo,Exciting and Entertaining from start to finish,10,14 May 2017,"The true test of a fantastic movie is when you get immersed in it. When the show grabs your attention at the onset and keeps you interested the entire time. Your mind doesn't wander about anything else but whats happening on the silver screen. And that is precisely what this movie does. Loved the beginning with the fantasy action. Immediately developed a dislike for the villain well played by Law. Charlie Hunnam had the presence and moxie to carry the lead role for the first time. Most characters were very well developed and the story line was tight. Really enjoyed the soundtrack too. Entertainment at its finest.Don't let the critics on Rotten Tomatoes fool you. The critic score was 27%, but the audience gave it a 77 %. Sadly the critics only want to give a movie a great rating when there's an oppressed group wronged, and this movie is not that.Here's to hoping there's a King Arthur II - Knights of the Round Table",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
926,elijahaldrich-15214,"If you are a fan of Guy Ritchie, this is a film for you",8,14 May 2017,"The moment I heard that Guy Ritchie was directing a King Arthur film, I was excited. I loved his most recent entries into the Sherlock Holmes films, and Man from U.N.C.L.E. Ritchie's blend of character and dialogue driven humor, his signature cinematography, non-linear editing, and adding on top of that the fantasy element made for a wildly kinetic look and style. I was not disappointed. From the opening scene the cinematography and editing served up Ritchie's style. The sheer energy in every scene is almost breathtaking. Even when slow motion is used, the atmosphere is as taught as a bowstring. All the battles are incredibly exciting, even when at times it is hard to follow what exactly is going on. Pemberton's score complements every scene, adding to the raw British energy that pulsates through the film. At times it felt more like watching a Celtic Rock concert with film accompaniment.The characters are well drawn stereotypes, and the actors all inhabit their respective characters with aplomb. Each character inhabits their own place and allows Hunnam's Arthur to take the spotlight and grow into his character. Jude Law also does terrific as the villain, a man driven by a desire for power at any cost. That said, there are some problems with the film. Some of the editing, due to it being non-linear,(again, this is a GUY RITCHIE film) can be confusing, events happen very quickly, and the film could easily have gone on for another thirty minutes to flesh out some of the world Ritchie created. However, those are my only gripes. It's not a thought provoking experience, there are no mind bending Nolan or Villenueve'isms. Just a simple entertaining story well told that is more of an adrenaline rush that the Fast films could hope to be. My one warning to someone watching would be this: DO NOT GO IN EXPECTING A HISTORICAL FILM! The characters reference everything from kung fu, vikings, characters named George and Blue, to other uses of language that are completely foreign to period films.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
927,creativeinception,Shocked,10,15 May 2017,"I don't care what anyone else says this movie hands down was amazing. I'm even going back to watch it a second time in theaters and that doesn't happen often. Super amazing movie. Great action, great acting and great suspense from beginning to end. I have seen all the older King Arthur movies of the same but they don't wow me like this.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
928,marcushartwell,Great Movie,9,15 May 2017,"Can't stand movie critics, this movie was fantastic. Classic Guy Ritchie mixed with a unique spin on a classic tale. I really love how it wasn't another boring King Arthur story like we got with Richard Gere and Clive Owen. It was full of humor, wit and action. I would highly recommend seeing this movie in the theater. The way the film was shot it needs to be seen on a big screen. My wife is not a super big action junk and she also love it. Getting a lot of bad press, but who cares about that sh*t. Go out and see this movie. I hope we get the 2nd film, the set it up for another one!-MH",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
929,mrkalingart-51950,Stupid movie.,3,16 May 2017,"Yesterday I watched the most stupid movie of the year, it is called: Kind Arthur. Since when were there any Chinese in Medieval England, practicing Kung Fu? And since when were there any black's? It's to stupid to be true. Sir Bedivere was not a negro! Also, there's a scene in which people talk about the slaves coming in. There where no slaves in Medieval Europe. Another thing is someone is called Mike. People in that period did not have any modern names. Last but not least, the story, it is completely ruined. Before named King Arthur he is known as Ward, the squire of young sir Kay, he is not raised in a brothel. King Arthur is guided his whole youth by Merlin; Merlin does not send a female (young girl) for his aid. When getting the sword out of the stone, Arthur does not reject the sword, on the contrary. Everybody bow's down to there knees in awe! Anyway, Guy Ritchie is good in making criminal action movies and even Sherlock Holmes, but he misses the respect and historic knowledge to make this movie. On a scale of 0 to 10 I give it a 3.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
930,amona-61579,"So much potential, yet so far off the mark",3,16 May 2017,"I've never written a review before, or not that I remember, but this one I just HAD to. I was looking forward to watching this, the trailer seemed to promise an epic movie with a lot of action and drama and CGI. But it was an epic fail. I've never been so disappointed in a movie with such great potential. There were so many parts that were rushed and parts that should not have been in there and then the story seemed clipped and I was like WHAT IN THE WORLD is going on? If only they'd slowed down the entire scene where he was being raised as a boy and built more into the character. I still don't understand the uncle being raised with the Madge and then wanting power on his own; and what him killing his wife and daughter for more power? He killed his entire family for power and yet just can't seem to kill King Arthur.By the way, when Jude Law uses the F word, I was sitting there like seriously? They said those kinds of words back then? I mean even the part where King Arthur has to learn to use the sword and goes through the dark forest or whatever the hell... that was so weird and yet it had potential to be AMAZING.All I'll say is, maybe under a different director like Riddley Scott, this movie could have been EPIC. I will say, it was a nice try.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
931,windwalkerfarm,LOVE this movie. Worth the money and time.,9,16 May 2017,"I loved this movie. Would pay to see it again. Fresh take on an ancient story, the action was great and the direction mixed with comedy was outstanding. There is an element of magic that borders on a little odd, but it also draws the viewer in and keeps you watching and wanting more. All the actors were very good and the director made sure nothing lagged on, in other words, he treated the audience like we are intelligent and able to figure out what he is trying to tell us- THANK YOU. Worth the money, go see it.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
932,sanjotk,Excellent Film,10,16 May 2017,"This movie was absolutely entertaining from the very beginning until the end. The methodical element of the movie might have created a conundrum for some critics, but to be honest it creates such a unique and exquisite experience when viewing this folklore in the 22 century as adapted version. The acting was superb, some of the best work I have witnessed from Charlie Hunnam, and Jude Law was definitely the best choice as the villain, outstanding cast. The cinematography is a while other experience all together, the visuals are stunning, which comes as no surprise as the movie did have a large budget, Unfortunately, due to critics not understanding the essential elements of this movie and its purpose, the low ratings will not drive higher profit margins for this film. But if you want to watch something that will engage your attention all throughout, and entertain you in a way you have not been in a while, then watch this movie regardless of what the critics say!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

934,noahisaacs,This movie is ridiculous and no one who wasn't paid could ever come out of this saying it makes sense.,1,17 May 2017,"I don't know what these pre-screening reviewers are smoking or how much they were paid to praise this streaming dumpster fire of a movie. This movie is so hilariously bad I genuinely questioned if the director was serious about this project. From the get go we start en media res and it all goes immediately downhill from there. This movie is filled with bad acting, awkward dialogue pacing, unnecessary montages, odd humour,bad camera work, and 300-esque action movie tropes out the wazoo. The only redeemable actors in this movie are Eric Bana and Jude Law. Everyone else should be ashamed of the work they did in this film. And that DOES include all the Game of Thrones stars this movie tried to use to truck fantasy fans into believing it might be good. The dialogue is either too fast paced to accurately follow, filled with boring monologues that drawl on for eBay and like five minutes, or is riddled with weird long pauses. There is no in between, and it all comes across as awkward and confusing. The training montages add absolutely nothing to the story, especially even Arthur has to learn not once, not twice, not three times, but FOUR TIMES how to use his freaking sword. The film also feels the need to pull some stupid slapstick humor on the audience like they expect us to find it genuinely funny. We Don't. I can't stress it enough how badly it undercuts this train wreck of a movie when we get humor that feels like it was written by a twelve year old. And to wrap it all up, you get lazy, overused camera tricks and action movie tropes like the ""slowing everyone else down while the main actor does some wacky moves that make no sense what-so-ever."" We get it, you saw marvel and Fox pull it off, so you thought you'd give me a whirl. You failed. This trope is tired and unless you're going to make it the coolest thing ever, don't use it. And especially don't use it MORE THAN ONCE! And if you're going to see this movie because you're a fan of Arthurian Legend, save your money. They trash those too. Like all of them. And they don't use any if the big ticket names in Arthurian Legends. Merlin? Guinevere? Gawain? Lancelot? NAH, forget those guys! You can have Goosefat! Or The Mage! Wanna know what their actual names are? Too bad, we won't even bother mentioning it until the very end! Honestly, if you gave this movie a good rating and you WEREN'T paid, you might actually be autistic. You will have to go back to 9th grade English to learn how a basic food story plot ought to be put together and then to reach this streaming pile of wasted money.TL;DR this movie sucks. The pre-screening reviewers lied to you. Save your money and go see Guardians of the galaxy again. It may not be the greatest marvel movie but it's a billion times better tab this burning bag of dog poo.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
935,siskorhodes,disappointing,1,18 May 2017,"had been looking forward to this film, and thought from the trailer it looked as though the Arthur story had finally been given a film to do the legend justice! But i was so very wrong, key characters missing and a very bad story line spoiled the well acted parts from Jude law, Charlie Hunnam who really did play the roles well. to date the only version of this legendary tale to get a good story line and show it as should be is the old time Disney cartoon lol perhaps they should do a live action version of that am sure will be far better than this film.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
936,conrad-11385,Creative but lacks wow factor,3,20 May 2017,"Finally after all the negative reviews, I decided to judge the movie for my self. Also note that I do not have any kind of past knowledge about king Arthur and his sword, so this movie is a complete new one for me. The movie, was a truly creative as far of presentation and sets used. However it seemed to have really lacked the wow factor. There were random jokes/dialogues which were quite difficult to understand. Saying that it's not meant for general public of average English level to understand and appreciate the full context. At time I felt that the movie picked up speed and just as it started to get interesting it would suddenly died down. What actually made me leave my seat after just 1 hour was the profanity used in dialogues were quite the modern times and therefore disconnected the charm of the past and epic historical legend. The sequence of mixing up the near future and present was really unnecessary, and thus created a lot of confusion.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

If you watched a single trailer you were going to know it wasn't meant to be, for its historic or literal accuracy. Its still a bloody amazing movie and I think that while they literally took 2 hours and stuffed it with as much mind breaking awesome material and resulted it being not very coherent at times. This still doesn't change the fact that I found it extremely enjoyable and each scene more dramatic and exciting than the last one.

I'm not sure why I've read reviews that say otherwise. Massive CGI to the point of unbelievable can ruin a movie so it was just enough eye candy to satisfy. And anyone who states there is no story refused to pay attention to the dialog in order to realize there was in fact one start to finish. Regarding the dark filters or colors used was obviously intentional giving a sense of the gloomy burden Arthur feels throughout this story.....it's not a comic book movie; just stop with the crazy comparisons to the like, if you want vibrant colors go see Power Rangers. If you didn't laugh enough, you might want to check your sense of humor or just ""follow along"" or you'll miss the punchline. I've seen several remakes in the last few decades & I really enjoyed the twist of the non-traditional King Arthur story-line with some elements that were retained. The only reason I gave it 8 stars is maybe a cheesy line or two in the climactic scene when it needed less words.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

953,dlgadpi,Excellent adventure movie with a new possibility of what Camelot rose out of,10,2 June 2017,"*May address key plot points**I saw this movie on opening weekend and didn't see in 3-D. I am a huge fan of Arthurian legends and I believe that each one I have seen on film and stage bring a new and unique possible views of Camelot. At the heart of all stories is Arthur and Excalibur. And some Magi's, Merlin, the mage. I also find Charlie Hunnam an excellent actor and feel he is often underrated. The CGI is fabulous. The scenes when you see Arthur and Excalibur together are magnificent. No there is no strong female knight or damsel in distress. This is focusing on Arthur leaning who he is, who he can count on to be by his side and learning what he and the great sword can do. I don't believe there needs to be a female role and was happy that some token female is not thrown in the mix to add what would have been an awkward and misplaced character or irrelevant token romance.Bottle line, great story and legend of Arthur, the knights of the roundtable and Excalibur. CGI is incredible. I feel the cast was excellent in casting and they each made you feel as if you were right there. I will be purchasing it for my movie library.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
954,yumimomoko,The Great Legend of King Arthur,9,4 June 2017,"The critics on this website and others have I think unfairly rated this movie. Here are some reasons why King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is actually a good movie and you should see it:1-The cinematography is incredible. 2- The special effect are also incredible. The CGI is used smartly in this movie, and its blend with miniatures and live action works perfectly. 3- Daniel Pemberton did a phenomenal job with the soundtrack. Each piece has its place and carries the action as well as creating a symbiosis with the visuals. 4- Several of the wisest, most powerful, and most important characters are people of color. There is representation in this movie, and not discrimination or references are made to a character's skin color except for one small joke in the movie. (Which is funny because it is a true fact.) 5- One out of the top three most powerful characters in the entire film is female and is not demeaned at all by others on her side for being female. 6- Shows the main villain of the film actually showing grief and powerful feelings toward his own family. It creates a three dimensional villain that the audience can relate to, and Jude Law also gave a fantastic performance as the evil king Voltigern. 7- All pieces of lore about Excalibur and the story is explained, nothing is left to speculation about how the sword ends up where it does. YES things have been changed from the original story, but in this movie all the changes are explain and accepted as facts, which for me was all that I needed to go along with it.This is a modern, high action interpretation of King Arthur's legend that lives to the expectation, because past the image of a mainstream blockbuster movie is actually touches on very important issues such as prostitution, PTSD, the responsibilities of a leadership roles and sacrifices.Please give this movie a change to amaze you.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
955,brendon_h,Complete mess of a film,2,7 June 2017,"Really disappointing overall. There doesn't seem to be a consistent cinematographic language, it's sort of like Lord of the Rings meets Never Back Down meets 300 meets Harry Potter. The historical elements (that one expects and wants when seeing a historical action film) are also a complete mess. The legend of King Arthur is set around 5th - 6th century where Roman occupation has more or less vanished and the country is being taken over by Saxons and yet the film has a whole segment on Vikings? (that's like 400 years too early) and everyone is dressed in costumes from the Tudor Court of the 15th Century? but then there's a crumbling Colosseum in London too? and there's also Kung Foo? and the famed London bridge with buildings along it from the 17th century somehow built in classical style rather than tudor? and Giant Elephants bigger than Camelot Castle, which also looks like the Twin Tower's from Lord of the Rings.

958,brookedotstanley,F*cking Dope <3,10,12 June 2017,"i am in love with this film - the camera-work, editing, score, action, feminist themes and overall re-imagining of the story of King Arthur.

959,vanitybeloved,King Arthur a must watch,8,17 June 2017,"King Arthur is a Warner bros. film picture directed by Guy Ritchie considered to be a legend of the sword. King Arthur is an awesome movie to watch the theme is played out as the history of the legend of the sword being unraveled throughout scenes, and by the time you get the full understanding of the story line, it's being revealed before your eyes. King Arthur is played by Charlie Hunnam from the series Sons of Anarchy also known by others as the next up and coming Brad Pitt. I kind of felt like the character of Arthur was a little off even his clothing seemed to be current fashion and distressed, so I was confused because the movies time line seemed to be those of ancient days in England.Arthur is a child who loses his identity through his father's death by the hands of his uncle Vortigern and goes on to be raised in a brothel becoming a handsome, loud, belligerent, and street smart yet a morally indwelt brave young man with a gangsta Robin Hood feel. His destiny then begins to unravel and be revealed to him by the power of the sword and its timing My thematic ideas of the movie are the battle of good versus evil, the light verses darkness, along with the law of karma being played out on Vortigern. The movie provided great graphics including those of 3-D where Arthur is revealed as the blood line of the king and manages to pull the sword from the stone with two hands. The lighting was dark throughout the movie I think the film re-visited Arthurs child hood lost in the form of nightmares too many times leaving a feeling of aggravation of thinking it meant something more than what it was, but also played the role of a motif.Other motifs were the sword itself in remembrance of the legend and the crown and the king Arthurs father as the image of power and heritage. I believe the movies ending resulted as a upcoming sequels to take place.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
960,karlsword,One of the best movies I have EVER seen.,10,30 June 2017,"This film keeps it REAL! The film is packed with brilliant storytelling. It begs for the observers attention, and if you let yourself watch this movie with the attention it deserves, the actors, scenes, settings and music will bind you like a spell. I am somewhat saddened that this movie doesn't seem to appeal to everyone, but neither does travel to Mars, so appealing to the great masses is hardly a mark of quality or greatness these days. I'd consider this among the upper echelon of storytelling and films. For anyone interested in the global phenomenon of prophecies where good and evil clashes, and weapons of divine forces comes to those who are worthy to stand up to the forces of evil, this well known legend of Excalibur is retold with great entertainment and intensity.Guy Ritchie, thank you for this film, and all of those who helped and inspired to this work. For this, I salute you.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
961,arvidschwenk,A movie with nothing to say,3,7 April 2021,"All in all, this movie left me feeling empty and energetically low, with not a moment of inspiration, true laughter or lifting up the spirit. It's basically an exercise in style and in this, it does a fairly good job.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
962,dukez-67365,King Arthur becomes Jason Borne,1,2 July 2017,"The story-line is OK. It gives a new twist on the sword. But trying to make the dialogue like an episode of the fast and furious just makes it totally unbelievable. Guy Richie should never direct anything that predates the year 2010. And special effects, while attracting those unable to think and understand a good plot, just couldn't make this dismal movie any better. The jittery camera sequences and music where an attempt to create intensity and I get it. But all they did was make you dizzy and I half expected Jason Borne to drop in via parachute and kill all the bad guys. For those in the biz, if you want to make an excellent movie about King Arthur, I recommend you read Jack Whyte's Camulod series and make something along those lines. Just score it with appropriate music and good solid dialogue and leave the special effects on the hard drive. Because I guarantee this movie won't be remember for anything other than its fast track to the bargain bin.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
963,rafalloveu,Top 3 in my life.,10,2 July 2017,"Just an opinion of a stranger. No doubt one of the best films i have ever seen. Pure pleasure to watch.

Looks like i need one more line of text so there you go.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
964,zz_liza,Better than professionally reviewed,9,6 July 2017,You have to watch it to believe it. I guess the professionally reviewed posts were based on some checklist criteria and this one surpasses the typical historic storytelling movies hence didn't make the cut for technical papers. No way that this movie is to be listed in the 'worst movie ever' list. Period.,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
965,krobinsonkr,Weird,4,27 November 2020,"This movie is as psychotic as the trailer depicts. The movement is breakneck. The graphics are like watching a trailer for assassin's creed.

966,alirakha,Best Movie ever that flopped so hard,9,10 July 2017,"I watched this movie on May 2017 and it was amazing , from the very beginning till the end , injecting this fantasy to King Arthur story took it to a new dimension. I liked the editing , score and directing , everything was more than fine . not a single bit boring .When i knew it flopped so bad i watched it again , i thought i might have missed something , still it was amazing ...It is a pity that there won't be a sequel",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
967,genesisdatasol,I don't think critics like to be entertained. Great Movie!,9,11 July 2017,"In all honesty, I've watched this movie 3 separate times and I'm still trying to find what the critics don't like about it. Maybe they are going for more of a Shakespeare feel, which I didn't care for in Excalibur. This is an action movie that just happens to be about King Arthur... You know, like Christian Bale's original Batman was more about the character that was developed in movie, than the huge personality associated with the name. I don't know, I guess I kind of like it that way. The action was way above par, the humor was good, but no ""Merlin""? That was about the strangest twist about the movie or maybe they were setting that meeting up for a sequel. All of the other things aside, Jude Law as twisted, demonic bad guy is really what made this movie for me.Blame the studio for pushing back the release date and ultimately landing it right around the same time Guardians of the Galaxy came out... That was not a wise move....All in all, this one was worth the time.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
968,amoslsinc,sigh....,7,11 July 2017,"damn man i really wanted to like this. I love Charlie and to be fair he was GREAT in it. It's kinda like a Deadpool meets Sherlock Holmes (the Robert downey version) meets King Arthur meets Jax lol. And I loved how he played Arthur. So there's that. But man let me just say right off I""m sorry cuz I'm an Actor and I hate to say this about any actor especially a female but the girl that played the Mage ruined the entire movie for me. She was just terrible and I can't even pin point if it was her acting or how she was directed or how she CHOSE to play the role but man alive it was horrible. She showed a range of about one and a half emotions throughout the movie. Dead and slightly less dead. Yikes. That being said - I loved so many things about this movie. It had so much potential but then it just fell flat. Especially the end I mean wth was that about LOL. So fake. Jude, Djimon, Eric and Aidan were AWESOME. Made the movie (with Charlie of course). Neil Maskell was also excellent. Quite likable oh and Kingsley also great great great. The story was different which I liked but I feel like it was disjointed i parts and you were just sitting there like wtf. how did we get here. Also the music and costumes stood out at times (NOT in a good way). And there was one big fight scene where I literally SAW the actor thrust a sword in between someone's arm and side under the pit like the used to in the old 1950's movies. I almost expected to see a big red cloth used as the blood lol. But sigh. I'd still say watch it cuz it has some great moments but maybe a different director or editor next time.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
969,rydeckiharps,Absolutely brilliant!!!,10,12 July 2017,"I cannot understand why this movie received so many bad reviews??? Perhaps it was the lack of ability to truly understand or experience any of it? What a film maker you are, and what a film you made... The interpretation into modern times, the acting direction, the editing, the thought put into the entire theme of King Arthur... Wow. We're amazed and transfixed, awesome. Cheers to all involved, and... thank you.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
970,ringadingdongbell,Disappointing,2,13 July 2017,"The guy that brought us ""It's a deal, its a steal, it's sale of the f***in century"" has gone downhill in my estimation. Poor writing, leaving the audience with indifference for both our hero and the dreaded 'Vortigern'. One line stands out above the rest of the shambles: ""It's a table...you sit at it"" - as the other knights joke about it being a dance-floor.This film fits well in the 'Transformers' genre - lots of special affects and action, but don't expect more than that. Fight scenes are repetitive and drawn out. Imagine a mix of LOTR scenes and atmosphere, mixed with surly cockneys and Northerners. Could have been so much more.It's gonna take a lot of Merlin's magic to make the clearly planned sequel comes close to the quality of Excalibur (1981).",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
971,lisa_hoseason,Worth a watch :),9,19 May 2017,If you want none stop action from start to finish then this is definitely a film for you. The characters are likable with lots of familiar faces throughout. Loved the special effects and the soundtrack is brilliant as it matches the style of filming (it's one that I'll be adding to my collection).It's a real shame people slated this film before it's proper release.... pop to your local cinema and judge for yourself and I think you will be pleasantly surprised!,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

974,aidailyana,The Soundtrack is Amazing!,8,3 August 2017,"I think this movie has an excellent list of soundtracks. It suits the purpose of giving an enhancement of emotion to the audience. It gives me goosebumps! It's rather a mixed of ancient melody with a hint of contemporary modernized rhythm that makes it memorable. I did find the plot is a bit hasty. It does not really well-developed. And I found the character Mage is just a pretty face. The actress's articulation is somewhat annoying with her humble facial expression. Not quite the best of casting. The rest of the actors give an plausible performance especially Law, Bana and Hunnam.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
975,bryanlighton,"Story is fine, the movie doesn't hold it up though.",5,7 August 2017,"This movie has a decent adaptation of the story of King Arthur. However anything interesting that may have happened is blazed over with ridiculous jump cut scenes meant to fast forward through time periods and assault you with amazing visuals that you almost get to see, which might have been something to look at. The entire focus of the movie seems not to be on the story but rather on Guy Richie and his pretty face and swag which doesn't seem to ever fit or seem believable. There are some good action scenes and battles that do keep the movie watchable.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

How did Uther fight his grandson Mordred when Mordred's father (Arthur) was still a toddler? Where is Morgan le Fay (Arthur's half sister)? This might have been an OK movie had they not tried to tie it to the legend (not myth) of King Arthur.As a movie about Arthur, it falls way short.

984,aurorafoote,A Really Great Movie With Wasted Potential,9,26 August 2017,"This movie had a lot of potential, and it was great overall, but the pacing spoiled some of its effect; it was difficult to keep up with the events, the characters, and their motivations. Where events would make sense chronologically, there were details cut out and used later as flashbacks instead of just telling the story as it went- the timeline jumps all over itself, particularly in the beginning. there was also a diverse cast of characters, each with their own personalities and motivations. Most of them are well-fleshed out, complex individuals. However, some of their stories are never rightfully explained. What's the beef between Goosefat and the Earl of Mercia? Why was the Mage, specifically, sent to help Arthur? Why did Kung-Fu George start a fight club in the old bathhouse? What does the resistance DO, other than getting Arthur to be king?While all the characters are lovable and distinct, some of them aren't given time to show their relationships to the main characters, thus weakening their impact on the plot. significant examples of this are Back Lack, who isn't actually given a lot of interaction with Arthur, and Vortigern's daughter Catia, who isn't even shown to have a loving relationship with her father. All of the characters had strong personalities, and felt like true individuals, but how they connected to each other sometimes fell flat.After watching it the second time, the plot line made a lot more sense. After watching it the third time? Even more so. every time after that, I noticed new details that made sense to the overall story. It took six times before I realized the connection between the bracelet Arthur picked up in the Darklands and the Mage's own bracelet; but it makes their interaction afterwards make so much more sense. It's unfortunate so much of this was lost to pacing issues; because the care put into some of the background details really did impress me.This movie was, altogether, a masterpiece. The CGI was incredibly realistic. The humour was sharp, witty, and never out of place. The characters were realistic. There were no out-of-place action scenes. The main character is relatable despite being so fantastical. The cinematography is amazing, it's altogether a beautiful movie.I would definitely recommend watching it. I already brought all of my friends to watch it with me. I've seen it 11 times so far. 11 times. That's about 22 hours of my time. and I was delighted to spend every second of it watching King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

If you know the legends of Camelot or you don't you should watch this movie prepared to enjoy a good story with Kings, Magic, heroes, villains, epic sword fights, even some cheeky humor. What you should not expect is to find a noble pageantry of folk lore. This is a great story of good triumphing over evil. Not sentimental but the the type of story that will take you for a great ride. Have only one expectation; to be entertained. Watching this movie was like 'seeing' the story any warrior could have told over a camp's fire. Just enjoy it, just go with it......Keep in mind that the legends of King Arthur are just that; legends. Every story teller through out time has retold legends in their own way. Guy Ritchie is a story teller and damn good at crafting his stories into visual form. Put away your memories of the story tellers that came before and let this one tell you his version.

990,MelissaCwater,I can't praise this enough,10,11 November 2017,"This is honestly my new favorite movie, which is impressive because the rival films on my list are incredible. I don't want to add spoilers, so I will only say the only initial reservations I had were at the intro scene. I considered the factor of the ""larger than life"" magical element to it to be a bit ridiculous, but after getting into the story and understanding more about it, I can honestly say that I have no complaints. It's amazing from story, to cinematography, to editing style, and among many other things, to humor. I actually was so impressed and engrossed that for the first time in my life I watched a movie 3 times within 24 hours. I rarely go out and buy a DVD/Blu-ray rather than having an electronic file, but I just had to have a physical copy. Some of what I loved was ironically what was criticized, such as the no romance aspect. It was pure grit in story-line and really let me get to know Arthur, rather than getting to know a leading lady and how he would fetch the moon in the sky for her. The characters were more than likable and relatable. I never realized how overdone the whole born to be a hero and save the world bullshit was until I watched this and came to find the lack of this element to be refreshing. It's so much easier to fathom someone who like the most of us, didn't have such a great start and had to really fight to get to who he would become. I more than hope to see the future installments of this film that it was meant to have and am crossing my fingers to one day see an extended cut with all the scenes intact, as a 3 plus hour version of this film actually appeals to me.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

I was skeptical at first watching this movie, however I was shocking surprised by how well the movie was. Firstly Charlie Hunnam does an amazing job acting out his role as noble yet humble Arthur, Jude Law is great yet I found his acting slightly under maybe because for once he's playing a bad guy which is not an ideal role. The action scenes are great, storyline is on point and very easy to understand for those watching that can't comprehend it. This movie was amazingly great I wish there was more exposure to it, more advertising for it, I truly feel if Guy Ritchie had actually promoted this movie more it would've been a huge blockbuster. I truly hope they make a sequel perhaps name it King Arthur & The Knights Table. I can't get enough of any movie or TV show Charlie Hunnam stars in he truly makes them a success.

The story of Arthur told in action rather than fairy tale.The special effects are top-notch. I was mesmerized by them. The creature of the lake was quite creepy and menacing with all those tentacles. The Hawk looked so real you can almost touch it and feel the powerful gusts of wind from it's wing-strokes. There were so many fantastic scenes augmented with CGI but they all seemed as real as any I've ever seen.The stunts were state of the art and they were plentiful. Hats off to the stunt guys and the choreographer. I always look forward to great stunts and this movie had them in spades!The actors all seemed to click with each other. Charlie Hunnam played his part to perfection as did Jude Law. But Eric Bana was at his best and I only wish he had been given more screen time. The entire cast hit every note and every queue with precision. The boys were in sync like a Swiss watch.The comedy woven into every aspect of the script was nothing less than phenomenal as I've come to expect in Guy Ritchie films. If his name is on the marque I'll be in the queue with all the millions of other Ritchie fans.,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
994,alexander-66973,"Quite an enjoyable fantasy flick, all in all",9,14 December 2017,"Important notice first: despite the title, this is NOT a movie about the classic legend of King Arthur.So if you go and watch this movie expecting to see that sort of story, you will be sorely disappointed.What is it instead: a trashy and (at least to me) quite entertaining yarn that is loosely based on motifs from the original Arthurian legend, with a considerable amount of more modern fantasy themes thrown in for good measure. Basically, the scriptwriters borrowed a couple of ideas from Arthurian legend, and then ran with them into generic Celtic fairy-tale territory. A long way.And they do that with a certain amount of style, and in an offbeat way. I watched this film on a long-haul flight, not expecting it to be any good whatsoever: 10 hours on a plane, and as this was my return flight, I had already watched all the obviously decent movies in the on-board entertainment system. And the first 5 minutes of this film are actually sort of awful, what with the over the top computer graphics effects (giant magical war elephants attacking Camelot? seriously?), and the ham-fisted action scenes that start it all off.But it really gets to be a lot better (and I really mean a LOT better) as the movie goes on. Jude Law delivers a captivating performance as the evil king, and for me the real star of the movie is actually The Mage - the sorceress embodied by Astrid Bergès-Frisbey. She comes across as one of the more convincingly creepy depictions of a magician that I have seen in any movie, probably because the director opted to show her magical work in a very low-key way (only her eyes change in those moments). King Arthur himself, and his rabble of loyal supporters from the gutters of Londinium, are also quite entertaining in their own way.A bonus point is that the ""bad guys"" (the henchmen of the evil king) are not portrayed in an entirely black and white fashion, either - some of them actually have a certain amount of character and morals. One more pitfall of typical ""good vs. bad movies"" avoided.Conclusion: high art this movie obviously ain't. But if you are looking for an enjoyable fairy-tale that is easy on the brain, and which delivers solid characterisations of various fairy-tale archetypes, good visuals, a plot that has surprisingly few holes in it for a modern movie, and quite good music - look no further. 9/10 for being exactly the sort of thing a fairy-tale movie should be (and for not taking itself too seriously, either).",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
995,elduderino-75799,It still sucks as an action movie,1,23 December 2017,"I mean, I wasn't expecting this to be an epic, much less historically accurate or even have anything to do with the legend. So they want to have some politically correct black and asian knights of the round table to cater for annoying SJWs so they're not accused of 'whitewashing' in a freaking arthurian legend? I don't care, fuck it, just give me some badass kung fu shots and I won't give a damn. I'm all for cheesy action movies. They're like porn: nobody gives a shit about plot or context as long as there's an excuse for great shots. *Still*, this piece of shit movie couldn't even manage to deliver good action shots. They suck so much, the CGI is dreadful, blurry, messy... it's like a low-budget fantasy Matrix. So many cuts to hide their shortcomings. The creatures are just oversized bad CGI animals and... oh, god, the dialogue sucks so much, even for action movies. Jude Law and Aidan Gillen are probably regretting doing it.

997,alvarezfive,Uninspired,2,4 April 2021,"The takeaway from the film is its focused on its own style rather than the characters and story that made the legend so popular, it is a different take but not done well, Its feels like it was made somewhat cheaply though with a large budget. Odd choices throughout and the in your face style just doesn't work for this piece in time.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
998,sam_i_am-19594,Loved the new look,10,1 January 2018,"The only problem i had was there was so much adventure packed into the 2 hour window. The acting was superb and I loved the new look of the movie I thought it was an inventive take on an otherwise, at this point in time, tired legend. Don't get me wrong I love the legend of King Arthur, but it's ridiculous that the ratings are so low just because people can't be open to a new way of telling the story. Anyway I strongly suggest watching this movie. There is no sex and very few swear words plus lots of action and best of all good triumphing of evil and the teaching that responsibility cannot be shirked. Put away your preconceived notions and the idea of 'that's not how the story of king Arthur goes' and watch an awesome new take on a great legend.
I hope there will be a sequel but.......judging from the other reviews......I won't hold my breathe",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
999,keegs-42801,Some user reviewers.....,9,3 January 2018,"Don't do reviews. But this film. As per Ritchie and the trailers is exactly what is expected. Witty and fast paced. Watch it, it's good.What really makes this film worthwhile is reading some of the user reviews. Jesus. Have you ever read such pompous, stuck up ramblings of people desperate to be taken seriously.It's a film. It is funny and the action is good.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1000,julissabenavente,Great movie,10,5 January 2018,Great actors and production. The legend told from another angle keeps you engaged from the beginning to the end,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1001,dirk_olsen,Best Movie,10,17 August 2018,"This is the best movie I have seen in a very long time. Even The Dark Knight didn't have as strong an effect on me as this movie. This movie is an epic so the more epic one can make the area they are watching it the better the movie will feel. I highly recommend watching it in a theater type setting with a good sound system and a large screen. It is fantasy, it doesn't push ideology, it can be viewed in a shallow surface type way, on can delve into it getting deep with symbolism and subtext. All in all a great movie.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1002,petreusadina,Top of my list,10,5 December 2018,I dont know what is going on with the rating for this movie but im very dissapointed i cant see the sequel. I keep replaying it cause its my favorite. wish they could give it another chance.,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

1004,jancearya,"Do watch this Movie with an open mind, u wont regret it..!!",10,21 July 2020,"The ratings and review of this movie are not upto the mark, I wonder what the audience was expecting from this movie. This movie have every thing, well except romance. I thouroughly enjoy this movie every time i watch and i have lost count, trust me.The way the story is told is very peculiar. The story jumps forward and the gap is filled with bits and pieces of the discussion among the characters. Its amazing how the plot moves forward. Once u go through it with patience, you will love it. The music is mind blowing.Charlie hunnam played the character well. And kudos to Jude Law.
Its a well written screen play.Do watch it, its definitely not a waste of time...",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1005,kbtvan,"The more I watch, the better it gets",9,9 March 2019,"In my humble opinion... After seeing this movie 3 times, I finally figured it out...it is a graphic novel onscreen. If you get that, nothing more needs to be said.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1006,andreabailey-91878,Fantastic film,10,2 February 2018,It's a Guy Ritchie film .... excellent in its diversity. Thoroughly enjoyed it. The cinematography was quirky and radical . I really don't know what anyone other than the historical die hard had to complain about. 10 out of 10,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1007,privateeroglu,Guy Ritchie - Please make us King Arthur 2,10,7 February 2018,"Please Guy Ritchie make us King Arthur 2 with Charlie Hunnam.

1010,shreyyadav,Awfully good and surprising,10,19 February 2018,"Looks like this movie has formed a much higher benchmark for action movies. Astonishing screenplay. Soundtracks fit the scene like bread with butter. One of the best movies, in this genre. Hats off to director. 
Highly recommended for adrenaline junkies.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1011,weaverjosh-08205,Amazing!!,10,1 February 2020,All the negative reviews are so off! This movie is brilliant and has the best music throughout the movie. Very great movie!,King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1012,sauerrobert,Pathetic attempt to make money with close to no effort,1,5 March 2018,"A vertiginous mix of London hustle charme à la Guy Richie, Robin Hood romanticism and Rome is somehow in London, which is strange because the tower of Babel plays a pivotal role. The story has holes everywhere, it hops from action event to action event, whatever is in between is negligible. We know the concept, for many people it works. BUT the action scenes are complete CGI bullshit. Animations are completely overused to cover up for a massive lack of choreography and creativity. The pattern is like this: closeup to our hero, who's staring with glassy eyes, in thoughts. Cut. His street-smart pals, armed with English accent, deliver a few punchlines. Our hero wakes up, has a better punchline and cut - action scene. Blurry CGI, the only thing you see is the protagonist's face and either blue (his sword) or red (his bad uncles fire magic) striae. So all in all I would happily pay the charge again to get those two hours of my life back.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1013,darib-88732,5 stars because Michael McElhatton,5,21 June 2020,"The only reason why I give this movie 5 stars is bc Michael McElhatton, I love him but the movie sucks!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1014,deebsdea,Fast paced and a very clever background score,9,24 March 2018,"I don't care if the plot is old, but the way it's presented was mind blowing coupled with clever background score. I really don't get why the movie didn't do well. I hope there will be sequels to it as planned",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1015,daemusin,"For those expecting a ""historical"" film, you're all wrong.",10,5 May 2018,"I've been reading lots of reviews stating that they were expecting a historical film, you wouldn't even handle it. What did you expect? A bunch of medieval people speaking Celtic? Do you even know how old is the story of king Arthur? Not to mention that it's not even a British tale, there are numerous version and the most famous is Chretien de Troyes, a French guy. Saying that the film sucks because it's not historical is like saying that all the Shakespearian plays that are not filmed in Elizabethan clothes are frauds. It's a beautiful film with an amazing sound and it took my breath away from the beginning to the end.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1016,tomcogswell,I think the negative reviewers have come to the wrong page...,10,6 December 2019,"Simply put, its was lock stock meets swordfighting and a bit of magic. Lock stock was awesome, and as GoT showed, a bit of magic and swords (if done well) are too. What's not to like?If you go into a Guy Ritchie film expecting anything other than Guy Ritchie....well, more fool you.Also, the story of King Arthur is a myth. There is very little historical evidence that bears any resemblance to the various incarnations of the story that we know today. Why would you assume a film (i.e. pure fantasy) telling a mythical story (again, pure fantasy), should need to be historically accurate?Its was a great film, a good story, told in Guy Ritchie's inimitable style.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword

1018,hamptoncomesalive,Ignore the bad reviews and watch!,8,27 May 2018,"There is a reason that ebert and imdb both have bad ratings for this movie, yet Google says 90% of users liked the movie! It's just like with food critics, anything they (the critics) don't like is usually good!",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1019,nmesomambakwe,Films are about imagination,9,6 June 2018,"I really liked the film. Lots of good acting. A beautiful story line . Not a very realistic king author movie but i don't believe it was made to be so. They give their own version of Camelot totally different from Camelot.
No morgana, merlin, modred and the other whole bunch of the knights of the round table. Just another version and i believe it should be judged as such. I absolutely loved the movie. The effects were beautiful too",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1020,jiminikiz,Great plot development and camera work with an Amazing take on the King Arthur tale,9,8 June 2017,"I was really surprised at how well so many scenes of this movie were shot. The fight scenes definitely left me blown away, especially at the end. I loved the sped up flashbacks and the narration of how to execute a plan, that element of scene making was really impressive.Not trying to spoil anything, but my absolute favorite part of the movie was the fact that Excalibur was depicted as being made of ""Damascus"" looking steel, a metal that for centuries was considered legendary in sword crafting within our real world. Kind of like the ""Valyrian"" steel from Game of Thrones, which is full of ripples when smelted into a sword. I really enjoyed the ""powers"" that Excalibur gives to Arthur when we wields the weapon itself; makes him almost hilariously powerful.Since this is planned to be a series of movies, I imagine the plot development and the deepness in which character story lines are delved into will be improved. Not to say that this first movie did a terrible job in anyway, but I feel like there is only so much one can put into a single/first movie, especially considering that it is packing so much action within.Overall, great movie. Not sure how someone would not at least enjoy the amazing action scenes. None of the crappy ""camera-man-with-a- seizure"" crap that many swordplay movies seem to use.Also, Charlie Hunnam is a bad ass, in general. But we all know that ;)",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1021,zaltanna,Why didn't this make more money,8,22 August 2018,"I didn't see this in theaters and I'm sorry I didn't. It was a great film. Highly underrated. The story was different and fresh, which is great when you have such an old story. The cast was diverse and talented. And the special effects were great. I see where the bulk of the money was spent. True it isn't the same old story but that's the point. While is doubt there will be a sequel, which was teased at the end, I would love it if there was.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
1022,ninnavinna,Best Movie I Have Ever Watched!,10,30 September 2018,"I am shocked to learn that I film so brilliant is considered a failure amongst critics. You could have a PHD^infinity and you could never convinced of the magnificience of this movie. 
Every single actor performed at full capacity, the jokes are funny, the soundtrack is insane.
The story is incredibly enticing, I really do not have more to say besides that I am obsessed with this move and of course mad because supposedly it was supposed to be a 6-movie sequel, now that is it. I really don't get it.",King Arthur - Legend of the Sword
