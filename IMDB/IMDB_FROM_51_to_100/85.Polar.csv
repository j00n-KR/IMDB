0,Leofwine_draca,The style counts for a lot,6,27 January 2019,"There seems to be a craze for assassin movies at the moment and Netflix's POLAR is the latest instalment in this overworked sub-genre. It's a comic book adaptation that's as gratuitously explicit, offensive and violent as it gets, so an obvious inspiration here is the kind of craziness we saw in DEADPOOL. The film even cocks a snook or two at JOHN WICK over the course of its running time. The plot is a familiar one, but this is undoubtedly a case of style over substance with lots of colourful cinematography and outrageous moments. It's one of the most violent films I've seen in a while, with extremely bloody shoot-outs and assassinations throughout; it's also light-hearted despite the explicit murder and torture taking place. Mads Mikkelsen is superb as the cliched-but-cool taciturn assassin, and the underrated Katheryn Winnick (VIKINGS) is pretty cool as his antagonist. Unfortunately some of the supporting actors go so over the top as to be completely annoying (I'm talking about you, Matt Lucas) although they'd argue that's all in the comic book spirit. In the end, there's nothing here you haven't seen before, but the cinematography and style is fresh enough to give it enough energy to be worth a watch.",Polar
1,SnoopyStyle,outrageous comic book movie,5,5 February 2019,"Duncan Vizla (Mads Mikkelsen) is close to retirement as a working class assassin. He befriends troubled neighbor Camille (Vanessa Hudgens) in their remote community. He is due to receive millions in payout by his employer Mr. Blut (Matt Lucas). What he doesn't know is that Blut has been sending out his assassination team to murder all of his retiring killers to avoid the pension payouts. Blut's right hand man Vivian (Katheryn Winnick) lures Vizla to an ambush in Belarus.This is trying very hard to be an outrageous comic book movie. I don't mind it although Matt Lucas is more silly than threatening. It's not that he's funny either. The best part is the confrontation between Vizla and the kill team. It's the thrilling climax of the movie. The later action is not quite as compelling. I don't care about Blut and Vivian only slightly more. I only really love the team of killers. Once they're dead, the movie loses some of its punch. It's one movie where I wouldn't mind if it ends sooner. Vizla could vow revenge against Blut for the sequel who could send another team of killers. As it stands, the movie slowly fades with a few cool moves like Vizla waving his lazer fingers. The movie needs a better Blut if it wants me to be invested in his death.",Polar
2,claudio_carvalho,Near Retirement,6,23 February 2019,"The efficient hitman Duncan Vizla (Mads Mikkelsen) will retire in a couple of days and will receive an eight-million dollars pension from the organization where he works as retirement plan. However his employer Blut (Matt Lucas) decides to double-cross Duncan to save the amount despite the advice of his assistant Vivian (Katheryn Winnick) to pay the pension to him. Duncan moves to an isolated cabin in Montana and befriends his only neighbor Camille (Vanessa Hudgens), a shy young woman. Meanwhile Vivian hires Duncan for one last job to kill the assassins of the retired hitman Michael Green, but with the intention of killing Duncan. However he kills the gang and returns to his house. Blut decides to send a team of assassins to kill Duncan at home. Will they succeed?""Polar"" is an action thriller with a violent and brutal story of double-cross and revenge. The plot uses many clichés but anyway is entertaining with Mads Mikkelsen performing a very tough assassin seeking revenge. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Polar""",Polar
3,nogodnomasters,Try not to be scared.,8,28 January 2019,"Duncan Vizla (Mads Mikkelsen) is employed by Damocles Enterprises based out of Washington D.C. He has a great retirement program and is about to score $8 million if he lives two more weeks. Duncan is a hitman. The company is being sold, but has too much debt on the books. Blut (Matt Lucas) who owns the company has been clearing the debt by retiring retired agents, and those about to retire.

4,classicsoncall,"""But sometimes the killer's in your head.""",7,7 May 2020,"Highly stylized and ultra-violent, this will mostly appeal to fans of the 'Deadpool' style of over the top action and unrestricted mayhem. Not to be unexpected, as this this is also based on a comic book creation from Dark Horse Entertainment. I liked the original premise of the story until I began thinking about it a little bit, because there's a fundamental flaw in Blut's (Matt Lucas) business model. You see, if his plan is to exterminate retiring employees in order to avoid paying their termination pension, then why would any of his other assassins on the payroll hang around for the same eventual treatment? Kind of a self defeating business plan, don't you think?And anyway, what self respecting assassin joins an organization like Damocles to look for work anyway? If you're as talented as Léon,The Professional, the work automatically finds you wherever you are. Be that as it may, Mads Mikkelsen turns in an exemplary performance as Duncan Vizla, assassin extraordinaire who figures out his plight and decides to turn the tables on his employer and army of hired killers. I won't go into how impossible the entire scenario becomes regarding Blut's torture and Duncan's 'good as new' offensive strategy on the fourth day, because that's not what a movie like this is all about. If you're here, it's because of the wild action and mindless bloodletting. Personally, I got more of a kick out of Duncan's 'show and tell' with the grade school class, fascinated by the customs associated with dead people.The sub plot with Camille (Vanessa Hudgens) seemed a little off to me as well. It's never made clear how and why she came to live almost right next door to Duncan in Triple Oak, Montana. The intermediary who sent her the two hundred thousand dollar annual payments presumably kept Duncan's identity a secret, so how would her search for the man who killed her family in a case of mistaken identity bring her to such a remote town? In the grand scheme of things it's a rhetorical question, but it's stuff like that I think about.Well, have fun with this one. You'll be immediately impressed with the gorgeous cinematography and exceptionally colorful palette applied to virtually every filming location. It's almost too bright for an assassin flick, though most of the relentless action and violent kills occur at night and in the darkened tunnels of the Blut mansion. Be aware though of those flashback scenes of Duncan's prior hit jobs, they have the potential of being vertigo inducing.",Polar
5,CinemaSerf,A bit of a vanity project for someone...,5,1 May 2020,"Very much a vehicle for Mads Mikkelsen (who also exec. produced it) as an old hit man who finds himself in danger as his old boss decides to bump him off so as to ... wait for it... claim his pension! Look not for depth of character nor a thought-provoking script; this has the look and feel of a violent video game transferred to the screen. The supporting cast really don't deliver much - two really bad performances from Matt Lucas and Katheryn Winnick and one mediocre one from the good looking, but dreadfully insipid Vanessa Hudgens leave the star well and truly out on his own.... There is plenty of action, and it isn't dull, but it's pretty shallow stuff that leaves little to remember it by afterwards.",Polar
6,Wizard-8,"Uneven first half, better second half",6,26 January 2019,"When I sat down to watch this movie after Netflix recommended to me, I admit that I didn't know what kind of tone I was going to get, though I assumed it would be a constant tone. However, the first half of the movie was so uneven that I almost stopped watching. The first half can't seem to decide what kind of movie it is supposed to be. Sometimes it's a standard serious action movie, but sometimes it's a really dark and black goofy exercise. The two extremes don't really mix too well, and the result is that in this first half, the tone of the movie feels just wrong. The violence feels too harsh next to the humor, and the humor feels kind of depraved next to the violence. The second half of the movie is much better, because it mostly plays out in one basic tone, a revenge actioner. This half of the movie is pretty well done, and had the whole movie been like that, we would probably have had a clear winner. But as it is, you have to sit through a really uneven first 50 or so minutes before the movie finds its groove. I was never bored at any moment, I admit, so that's why I'm giving the movie a marginal thumbs-up. If you are prepared to forgive the movie for its uneven first half, it's probably worth a look.",Polar
7,trashgang,"absurd, another Netflix surprise",8,11 February 2019,"If you are into hard action flicks then this is your thing but you have to take the absurdness with it. If you like the Punisher series then watch it without hesitation.Face it, what the main character has to stand through normally you are death but hey, if you can stand things that can't be seen in real life then you will like this. It's absurd and brutal. And the story isn't that bad after all. Perfect casting, clichés all over, really, another Netflix surprise for me.Be advised, it has a lot of blood and gratuitous nudity.

8,deloudelouvain,Mads Mikkelsen is the man.,7,14 May 2019,"There are good and bad things in Polar but overall the positive things outwheighs the negative things. The action is way over the top with a hero (played brilliantly by Mads Mikkelsen) facing twenty or more ennemies at the same time and still winning, it's sometimes a bit annoying but that's what you get with these kind of movies so it's best to not pay too much attention to that kind of details. Matt Lucas (from Little Brittain) should stick with things he's best at, short humoristic sketches, as to me he's the weakest link in Polar. His evil character has no credibility at all when played by him. Mads Mikkelsen is by far the best actor in this movie. His character was perfect for him, introvert and stone cold, the face fits the character. The action scenes, even though exaggerated, are entertaining and bloody, the cinematography is surprisingly good with very good unique shots at times. All in all Polar is an entertaining movie especially in this genre.",Polar
9,siderite,A bunch of cliches bundled together,4,6 May 2019,"Imagine John Wick part 26 and you get this. It's lame, boring, doesn't add up and seems to serve no purpose than to serve gore and violence. And truthfully, that's boring, too. Hard R? I've seen French kids movies that are more brutal. And the cast... what were they doing there? Mads Mikkelsen? The annoying robot from Doctor Who? Lagertha? The Master from The Strain (no makeup, though), Richard freaking Dreyfuss looking so old you believe him when he says he is dying? It felt like one of those Russian movies that buy a few American actors to front something done with lots of money and no talent or passion and expected only to make e profit. No soul, just a eurogangster Hollywood clone.Let me be unambiguous: this is not one of those ""OK, they tried and it didn't work"" movies. It's something that no one expected to work except as a trap for gullible viewers who believe bought magazine ad reviews. It's so bad that getting drunk will not make it funny. It's so bad that the few good scenes feel so out of place you suspect it's some kind of parody with a deeper sense that you can't grasp yet. It's so bad you can't believe you are watching it and you just have to watch it to the end to make sure it isn't all a setup for an after credit scene that points to the real movie. It's so bad you will consider scanning your brain for computer viruses after watching it.Don't watch it. Shame, Mads! I had higher expectations from you.",Polar
10,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Stylish and slick, but a bit overwhelming",7,28 January 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDuncan Vizla (Mads Mikkelsen) was one of the top assassins in the business, but has now become reclusive, and lives a quiet life in isolation. However, recently there have been a spate of killings of other former top guns for hire, and it seems he may be next. It all links to his former employers, headed by the flamboyant Blut (Matt Lucas), who have a policy of removing former killers once they turn fifty. Meanwhile, he befriends Camille (Vanessa Hudgens), a young woman who may hold more keys to his past than he imagines.Once we've strapped ourselves in for the long and bumpy ride that is Polar, we open with a pleasant poolside location, with bright sunny weather and hot girls and cocaine on tap, Earth, Wind and Fire's September playing in the background, only for it all to be shattered by a group of paid killers turning up (along with one of the girls) and a brutal killing sets a totally different tone. But it's just one of many leaps and jumps in Jonas Akerlund's hard hitting but uneven action thriller.It jumps on the modern trend of fusing cool, stylish, flashy visuals and credits with blood splattered, brutal violence, which is pretty unflinching and full on throughout. It certainly reminds you of Tarantino, and indeed the plot itself is more-or-less directly lifted from his Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2 films. But what it can't shy away from is the conflicting tones of this and the more heartfelt, gentle moments in the film, where Vizla bears his soul and connects with Camille, which makes it feel like two different films.Cast wise, Mikkelsen certainly has effective presence as the dark, moody, gruffly spoken hitman, although this is at odds with the film's more humourous elements, and Hudgens is good as the gently embittered Camille, whilst Little Britain's Lucas makes a surprising appearance as the chief villain, although his camp English persona and equally genteel secretary feel like they belong in a film with more of a fantasy element to it.But while the violence and style catch your eye, at just under two hours, it's an overlong film, telling a cliched story that doesn't have enough gravitas to last the length, while also struggling with an uneven tone that knocks your senses about more than all the shooting and bloodletting on display. ***",Polar
11,bowmanblue,Colourful comic carnage,7,1 February 2019,"Even since Liam Neeson put down his pipe and slippers and started wiping out scores of henchmen at least a third of his age (ala 'Taken') there's been a bit of a trend in Hollywood action films to cast an older hero in the lead. I've seen films where Sean Penn and Nicholas Cage basically follow in Neeson's footsteps and now it looks like it's the turn of Mads Mikkelsen to pick a gun or twenty and go on a murderous rampage of revenge.The story isn't anything new. He's a hitman who gets doublecrossed by is own side and now a team of hitmen is hunting our hitman. Apparently, it's based on a Dark Horse comic and I haven't read that, so I can't say how closely it sticks to the source material, but it certainly does its best to make itself LOOK like a comic book. Seriously, I don't know exactly how they've done it, but it must have something to do with exposing certain colours and using filter-trickery. Anyway, the film is soooo colourful. The director deliberately highlights plenty of primary colours to make it look like a 'living comic book.' Pretty cool really!And, just like so many comic books, it's totally over the top. You really will have to suspend your disbelief and appreciate that nothing is really going to be particularly 'realistic' here. The blood is over the top, the character design is over the top and the gore is very over the top. In fact, it might be worth noting that there's a few scenes of quite graphic torture and you may need a strong stomach to get through them!Mikkelsen has to protect the compulsory damsel in distress, played by a (practically unrecognisable!) Vanessa Hudgens (in fact, I didn't even know it was her until I saw her name in the end credits!). While the head villain is played by British comedy actor Matt Lucas, who's clearly enjoying himself as a 'Little Britain' style villain.There's plenty of great (and, as I've said, over the top) action and my favourite scene was the one with the 'green lasers.' You'll have to watch it to see what I mean, but it reminded me of the 'best' scene from Arnie's 'Eraser' film. There's a team of cool badguy assassins who are on Mikkelsen's case and I would have liked to see more of them really.It is quite a long film and maybe it could have been edited down here and there, plus there are about two scenes where I really did have to suspend my disbelief a little too much to get through it (both involved scores of totally incompetent henchmen being totally unable to hit Mikkelsen even when they have many clear shots on him). However, those are just minor gripes. Overall, 'Polar' is a lot of fun and even makes me want to see what the comics are like. Great fun, just sit back, put your brain 'on hold' and enjoy (especially if you're a fan of other similar movies like 'Shoot 'em Up' and the 'Crank' series).",Polar
12,tabuno,Starts Strong But Descends Into More of the Mundane Sameness,7,31 January 2019,"Warning spoilers. Overall, this movie starts well but eventually descends into a more mundane finish with a sort of interesting twist that seven so still felt unfinished.This Netflix production of the assassin genre presents a youthful, techno-film (with a distant resemblance initially to some of the art work from last year's Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse). This film then commingles with a more sedate, independent movie cinematography. In some ways this movie is a sadistic, serio-comedic, over-the-top dramatization to shock audiences into a sort of mesmerized state of fetish rapture. However, for other audience members, this movie might just come across as a raw, immoral mess of juvenile hyperactive crap. Then at the same time the more tender, slow-paced reflective element that supposedly dominated the film a lot of the movie while the techno-fireworks became at first more of an interlude to keep the pace of the movie going to sustain some captivated interest in the movie for those who liked hyper-energetic action. Though the more sedate thread of this movie isn't without its own gory flashbacks that at times is used for a weird humorous sort of shock effect. The addition of a giftt that can also be lethal is also a bit incongruous to a more likely relationship scenario (though such a present could be deduced as a consistent part of the movie where the audience is forced to take the deeper mental leap of logic regarding the earlier scenes of fear which the script could have made some effort to clear up in a more compelling dramatic way on film). Taken together, the humorous flashback and gift scenes results in losing some of movie's the more intriguing and appealing authentic tone. However, the time and how the female neighbor's story is revealed is very well executed. Then the use of the mother and her son in another earlier scene introduced a new creative and innovative level of qualitative emotive, ripping tension to the assassin film genre.It is when both storylines in this movie that the resulting collision attempts to create a more dynamic third look to the movie, except it seems to become an almost too incredible beginning scene that wasn't sufficiently forecast to the audience. It's as if the scriptwriter didn't even know how to explain away this scene except just to make it into some spontaneous thrilling action scene. Nevertheless, by the middle section of the movie, a sweet desire for revenge is amplified by the audience's highly motivated need for retribution of sicko assassins and how it is resolved would probably be encouraged by a loud cheerleading squad of audience participants. Conveniently, as well as the trailers reveal, this movie extends itself to the typical kidnapping rescue scenario (Taken, 2008). Then there is the overly quick, uninspiring, unconvincing takedown of our leading character, especially considering how supposedly astute he has been and supposed to be. A lot of the second half of the movie is a sort of cruel repeat of the first part of the movie with the addition including many brief shots of intensive, gross amounts of physical torture, suffering, and mayhem along with scenes of induced involuntary drug addiction leading up to another predictable crescendo of action and retribution. The ensuring physical battles don't quite have the elegance nor the finesse as Hitman: Agent 47 (2015), Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) or The Bourne Identity (2002), especially some of them shot in the mostly dark dungeon of sorts like of how the fight scenes in the over-rated The Dark Knight (2008) were photographed. Some of the scenes even become more like repetitive, unconvincing video game combat and martial art kill shots where you the character seemingly almost never dies. By the end, the movie has lost its originality and the hoped for amazing twist just seems to be a cute afterthought that seems to go nowhere, except for the unlikely sequel.Other similar movies include The Prince (2014) especially with Bruce Willis in his antagonist role; Tokyo Tribe (2014) for its sadistic stylized Japanese gang violence; Dune (1984) for its evil Baron Harkonen. Also V for Vendetta (2005) is another nicely stylized, polished movie about revenge on a huge scale. Interestingly, this movie also has an echo of the ultimately lone hero from the sci fi movie Oblivion (2013) and Hanna (2011) about an adolescent female assassin.",Polar
13,Platypuschow,Polar: Stylish but shallow,6,29 January 2019,"I can confidently say I wouldn't have watched this had it not been a recommendation. I don't like action films and I don't like Mads Mikkelsen so it was doomed to fail from the start.As the credits rolled I was immediately impressed however by the cinematography. It's not just how stylish it all was, it's the alarmingly competent use of color. The whole movie looks fantastic and that I certainly didn't expect.Furthermore Mikkelsen was great, this is the first movie I've enjoyed him in. The rest of cast also delivered with Hudgens once against demonstrating that she is a competent little actress and putting High School Musical (2006) behind her.Matt Lucas however as the villain in a serious Hollywood action film? That I didn't see coming and I'm very torn over it. Sure he did a great job, but it's still Matt Lucas he still looked out of place and in that getup all I could think of was Little Britain's ""Only gay in the village"" character.It tells the story of a soon to be retired assassin who finds himself a target of his own organization. Therefore we're talking high octane action, gore and rather offensively silly over the top gun play/fight sequences that you certainly need to leave your brain at the door for.So decent cast, great looking, suitably scored, so why the little over average rating? Well for a start it's still a mindless action film, it's still far from original and all the style and gloss can only take it so far. Furthermore there is a sequence involving a dog in the early moments of the film that was senseless, unforgivable and just shouldn't have been. For me one single scene can damage a film and for Polar that was such a scene.A competent action film that would have had 7/10 if it weren't for that one stupid moment.The Good:Impressive castVery stylishThe setting is beautifulExcellent use of colorThe Bad:Immediate minus a point for one of the awful opening scenesStill just a dumb action flick",Polar

Let's face it, this is not the type of film you can recommend to anyone, and definitely is an acquired taste.Let's go with the positive notes first. The cinematography is absolutely STUNNING. The settings are great, and the photography is amazing! Note the interesting use of color in the film, especially bright yellow. I'd actually like to know the director's reason behind accentuating yellow. For a film with such a dark theme, it had a very bright look. The visuals are fantastic. Mads Mikkelsen is sensational as the antagonist/protagonist. He reminded me so much of Logan Marshall-Green in 'Upgrade'.The film is extremely gory and brutal, though, but I suppose one should rather view it as satire, as it is done in a very satirical manner. Both satirical and sick, actually. Although 'Polar' is filmed like a comedy, it is a very, serious film. It also offers a shocking twist I never saw coming.In general, this film is just WOW, WOW, WOW!! I've never seen anything like it before, thus making it a truly unique film.

16,cruise01,"Stylish, violent, and pure stupid humor.",3,14 February 2019,"Polar (1.5 out of 5 stars).Polar is a cheesy neo-noir action film that tries to be stylistic with its direction and action. But the end result is it being really cheesy and terrible. The films plot is a boring one about an assassin coming close to retirement Duncan (Mads Mikkelsen) were his agency decides to tie up loose ends by setting him up to be killed. Duncan befriends his neighbor Camille (Vanessa Hudgens) were she is estranged and distant about her past but is obsessed on trying to get to know Duncan.The film's direction is horrible. It tries playing for cheesy laughs, tries to get stylistic with its violence, and being flashy with its annoying characters. None of it is entertaining. The opening scene with Johnny Knoxville playing a retired assassin who is being hunted by a rogue group that has their own signature look. The dialogue is stupid and cheesy. It is not even funny. Plus the gratuitous nudity felt like the director was obsessed in capturing those shots.The plot was dull. The villain played by Matt Lucas was annoying and boring.

But he gets asked to do one more job. That's a story we have seen a trillion times before. What's different about this one?The good: excellent acting performance by Mads Mikkelsen as an old hit man. There is more good to be found in a playful direction style, with excessive violence, which is still impressive to watch, however repulsive and cheap it is simultaneously.Any bad? It is not really funny, but it is not seriously dramatic either. It's only made to shock the viewer with graphic violence. The supporting actors are NOT credible and rather mediocre, at best. Mat Lucas is definitely miscast. That's a real disappointment.There is more wrong: the story is a formula, which has been told many times before, no real surprises there.

22,southdavid,Bye Polar !,2,29 January 2019,"Editing decisions and tonal problems undermine any good work that Mads Mikkelsen is doing.Mikkelsen is Duncan Vizla, a hitman whose agency turn on him as his 50th birthday is approaching in order to save paying him the extensive pension that he's accrued over the years. Though Vizla is haunted by dreams from an earlier hit that didn't go as planned, he's not willing to go quietly into the night and attempts to turn the tables on the gang of younger assassins that are sent to retire him permanently.There's almost two films at play within ""Polar"". One, whilst never making it to the realms of ""Good"", is an acceptable, if derivative assassin story that see's Mikkelsen retreat to his isolated cabin, interact a little with his neighbour and await the time his would be killers launch their assault. It borrows liberally from other Assassin stories, particularly ""John Wick"" (at whose expense an early parody falls flat) and ""Leon"" as he establishes a non-standard relationship with a younger woman (this time played by Vanessa Hudgens). There is enough in all of this aspect of the film to make you care about the pair a little, they at least feel like real people, admittedly though where one of them has a very unusual job. When the film works at all (which isn't very often) it's when it leans into these aspects.Unfortunately, anything good there is undermined, vomited on and the buried in concrete by the other half of the movie. A witless, childish mess of colours, noises and actions that's principle demonstrated by the villains of the film. A hopelessly miscast, Matt Lucas is the films lead villain. His character a collection of sexual threats, odd perversions and a complete incapacity to think through a plan. Though given nothing to work with, he is, frankly, awful and is fortunately that more people won't see his Razzie worthy turn to have it be a contender next year. The rest of his gang of assassins is also a lowlight. Logically, the team should have a series of different skills but here they appear to have got their roles based solely on looking unusual. They, and the cavalcade of drug addicts, snuff film makers and morbidly obese characters they interact with are, I think, supposed to be funny and edgy. They are not, they are eye-rollingly awful.The potential that was present in ""Polar"" is squandered entirely by this desire to be quirky or offbeat.

Violence here is quite intense to the point where you would just grit your teeth. The film is not subtle when it comes to anything here, If you are easily offended then you should probably avoid this.Mads Mikkelsen gives a pretty good performance has a contract killer, and it's clear has you first see him that his job is starting to wear on him, and wants to retire, but when the action comes in he does deliver. Some of the side villains look like rejects from a Quentin Tarantino film, don't get me wrong they are okay. Matt Lucas really dials up his role has a evil crime boss, but you enjoy hating him cause of it. Vanessa Hudgens is okay, not giving too much. Action scenes are pretty good.",Polar
24,alindsay-al,A Poor generic action film that does nothing new,3,26 January 2019,"This film has just hit Netflix and I decided to give it a watch. The Premise of this film sees a group of mercenaries go after a retiring hitman for a huge price. Mads Mikkelsen is the lead in this film and I thought he did a great job, it is a slightly different performance then I would usually expect from him. He sells the dangerous hitman really well and absolutley nails the action scenes to help add some legitimacy to this film. The supporting cast is really poor, Vanessa Hudgens is in this film and she has a poor character in this film, she tries but just the material given to her character just really doesn't work. Matt Lucas plays a mad villain in this film and I just couldn't take his character seriously at all which contradicted the overall tone of the film. The rest of he cast offered absolutley notjing to the film and could have been played by anybody. The story is very generic and bland but fit the overall tone of the film until the last 15 minutes which in my opinion completley ruined this film for me and made this film feel really stupid. The script for this film is incredibly generic and doesn't add anything unique to it to make it stand out from the other films in this genre. The style of this film have some cool action scenes in it especially one in an underground hallway which is great to watch. But the pacing of the film is just off and makes the first 45 minutes feel like a waste of time. Overall this film is really poor and isn't worth a watch at all.",Polar
25,iquine,Is a Pox on Society,3,8 October 2019,"(Flash Review)This can be quickly summed up as just a bunch of vapid killing by a gaggle of idiots ordered by an immature cry baby to kill an crafty veteran hitman.The movie is frankly immature with loads of ruthless blood splattering as the 'younger' hired guns coldly take out everyone in their path as they hunt down a veteran hitman approaching retirement. Their objective is to assassinate retired hitmen so the organizer of the agency (I guess?) doesn't have to pay out their retirement savings/pension. Not a surprise that this particular hitman has some tricks still up his sleeve and not a surprise at who will be left standing at the end. This 'movie' is modern, colorful, gory and serves zero purpose for existing. The killings aren't even creative or memorable; they are just vile. The only thing partially saving this is the twist toward the end.",Polar
26,sauravjoshi85,Promising start and disappointing End,5,23 January 2021,"Polar is an action thriller movie directed by Jonas Akerlund and stars Mads Mikkelsen, Vanessa Hudgens, Katheryn Winnick and Matt Lucas.Despite of the 'all time reliable' Mikkelsen and a superb start and the viewers expecting another slam-bang action thriller with lots of violence and blood but as soon as the movie progresses it falls and gets into the category of another mediocre revenge movie.The plot of the movie is predictable with a script we have seen in many other revenge movie with Mikkelsen the only Savior of this mess. The movie lacks the important ingredients of an action thriller movie should have and hence disappoints.Acting apart from Mikkelsen is largely disappointing. Matt Lucas who portrays the character of the ruthless employee Mr. Blunt looks ineffective in most of the time and it seems that he was trying too much to maintain the standard set by Mikkelsen. Both females were also average with Winnick having the edge.Screenplay of the movie gets predictable soon after the start of the movie and despite of fast paced action scenes couldn't keep the movie binded. Cinematography and background music should be appreciated. Climax also has nothing to offer and most of the viewers would now have had guessed the ending.Overall despite of an impressive and reliable Mads Mikkelsen the movie largely disappoints due to its cliche plot and mediocre direction.P.S. The movie is very very violent with lots of disturbing scenes which can shake few viewers. Discretion is advised.",Polar
27,TdSmth5,Surprisingly entertaining,7,18 September 2021,"A bunch of goofs are about to kill some rich guy somewhere in his mansion. Why it takes 5 people to kill some completely unprotected guy who knows. Then we meet Vizla, another killer part of this outfit called Damocles. He's taking care of some business with his accountant. Vivian who sort of manages the killers gives Vizla his...yes...his ""One Last Job"" (TM) before retirement. He ""reluctantly"" agrees of course, travels to Belarus and nearly gets himself killed because the whole thing was actually a setup. Back in the US, Vizla goes home to his Montana cabin where does...basically nothing. He has nightmarish flashbacks of killing some people in a car. There's a girl living conveniently by herself next door who is beyond traumatized. Eventually...finally...they start talking and he helps her out with stuff.We meet the boss of Damocles, some nasty fellow named Blut. In order to avoid paying retirement he's having all his soon-to-retire employees whacked by the goofs. Why the goofs/Vivian don't wonder about their own predicament who knows. So now he has Vivian order the goofs to go after VIzla who has hidden his tracks well. They have a hard time finding him but eventually make it to Montana where they attack him, but he's too good and saves himself. That forces goofs to kidnap the neighbor Camille somehow knowing that Vizla will go after her. Which he does and that gets him captures and tortured by Blut. Still he manages to escape and now has to again try to rescue Camille, take out Vivian, Blut, and his army of goons. Eventually we learn what's up with the flashbacks and learn a secret about Camille.There's plenty of delightful violence and even some nudity. The story works well. Acting is very good throughout. Ruby O. Fee is lovely and Katheryn Winnick steals the show as always. Cinematography is nice and colorful when it comes to Damocles and awful and colorless in the Vizla scenes.

While it's true that many of the characters are whacky, and the leads are far more conformist in terms of what we've come to appreciate in assassin fare, so to speak, the miracle of this movie is that it still works. Somehow the world created is edgy and dangerous, really entertaining. The photography helped, wonderful shots of snow-bound rural landscapes and here and there a keen eye for beauty. There was a bizarre originality to the victims as well. The editing got the audience to the point quickly, refreshing. The key to this movie, I think, is that we just haven't seen anything like this style before, or at least, an evolution to this style. The plot is not wickedly original, but it is original enough, and anyone into modern action is going to love Polar. Why was it called Polar? No idea. Loved it anyway.",Polar

Nearly every other aspect of the film is almost perfectly tuned and judged. So WTH happened with the role (and performance) of the lead villain?Even if you can overlook the lazy, scenery chewing performance and unforgivably lazy acting choices made by the actor playing ""Blut"", the dynamics of the role make no sense. How can a buffoon like this possibly be in charge of a world-wide cadre of mercenary assassins? I know, it's intimated that he inherited the company from his daddy, and I get the ""entitled rich kid"" vibes, but you can't tell me that the people he supposedly bosses around wouldn't have flattened him like a cockroach and taken over within the first month of his reign. You MIGHT be able to make it work in a comic, but it sure doesn't work here.Edit out ""Blut""s footage and replace it with the same actor playing the role like Bond villain ""Blofeld"" (and allow his character to leak just a *little* bit of cheerful sadism), and ""Polar"" would have been damned near perfect.

Equally disturbing is the number of people here on IMDB who have praised it and given it a high rating or tried to justify it as a ""comic book on film."" My 5 is more than it deserves. Yet the production values, the far out characters and the effects are excellent. Hollywood continues to glorify extreme violence while lamenting almost daily mass shootings.

44,kjproulx,Over-Stylized,2,29 January 2019,"It's one thing to have a film that ends up being style over substance, but when your entire movie pretty much hinges on people moving that aspect and nothing else, it's doomed to fail from the start. Polar is one of Netflix's most recently released feature films and from every piece of marketing I saw for this movie, I was genuinely excited. From the crazy visual style to the fact that Mads Mikkelsen was the leading man, I found myself counting the days until the release of Polar. Sadly, not only is this movie a disappointment as a whole, but it's so pretentious in terms of filmmaking that I was disgusted throughout the majority of my viewing experience. There are many factors that went into having me despise this film so much. Don't get me wrong in thinking that I enjoy ripping on films I don't enjoy, because it's quite the contrary. I like to find the good in films, no matter how bad they are, so when I speak of a film this poorly, you should know that I mean every word.After years of being an assassin, Duncan finds himself needing to get back in the game, just as he's about to retire. This trope has been used many times and it still used very well throughout some films, so this isn't what bothered me all that much. A Newer, young group forces him back into war and to say there's a lot of bloodshed would be an understatement. This is a film about violence, violence, and more violence, with not much substance in between. Aside from a relationship he forms with his neighbour (played by Vanessa Hudgens), this is one of the most one-note characters I've seen in a film in a while.As I already stated, it's not that I find violence offensive when it comes to movies because I enjoy a great bloody action sequence as much as the next person, but there was no point to it here. From pointless beheadings to needless torture scenes, to an overall visual style that the editors must have been impressed with for reasons that are unknown, I found myself wondering how this film saw the light of day. On top of these elements, the film is very choppily put together, but I fear that was probably in the director's vision, given his past work.Having only worked on one film that I've seen (Spun), Jonas Åkerlund has had a long career in the music video industry since then. Winning multiple awards for his direction in that regard, I think he can forgive the negative feedback that I'm sure he'll be receiving by many more than me for this one. Going from a dramatic moment between two characters to an over-saturated room with gothic music playing and quick flashes of random violence made me feel like I was watching a music video that had been randomly placed in the middle of a film. That was actually the style of the entire movie though, as instances like this occurred quite often.In the end, I admire when a film tries to go for it in ways that usually aren't shown to mainstream audiences, but when that's all the movie has to offer, it falls flat on its face for me. It's more disappointing to see a film try so hard to be good, rather than just be an average one. For that reason alone (although the year is still young), I'll probably be mentioning this film within the conversation for worst films of 2019. As I said, I admire the devotion of the filmmakers here, but it really didn't work for me at all. I'd recommend staying far away from this one.",Polar

48,MrDHWong,Misses the mark in every way an action thriller should,3,18 April 2019,"Polar is an action thriller based on the webcomic ""Polar: Came From the Cold"" by Víctor Santos. Starring Mads Mikkelsen in the lead role, it is a poorly-edited, bone-squelching mess of a film that not even its reliable top billed actor can save.Duncan Vizla (Mads Mikkelsen), once the world's most deadly hitman, is preparing for retirement as he approaches the age of 50. Upon finding out a new group of assassins are after him, Duncan postpones his retirement to ready himself for the impending onslaught.As gratuitous as it is violent, Polar misses the mark in every way an action thriller should. In good films of this genre, like the John Wick series, the violence is stylised and doesn't feel glorified, but in this film it only feels like an edgy attempt at shock value. The film's choppy editing, wavering tone, and poor moments of comic relief make it difficult to take in the atmosphere of certain scenes. For example - in one scene a morbidly obese man is graphically shot dead and shortly afterwards his dead body makes the sound of farting and diarrhoea. Rather than elicit a laugh, it just makes the scene feel awkwardly juvenile. In addition to this, every supporting character, apart from Vanessa Hudgens, was woefully underdeveloped, likely so they could be used as bullet fodder for the film's protagonist. Mad Mikkelsen does his best as the deadly hitman Duncan Vizla but even he can't save the film from all of its obvious flaws. While there are some nice scenes between him and Vanessa Hudgens' character, these don't happen until near the very end and don't feel earned. Also, Little Britain's Matt Lucas is terribly miscast as the film's main antagonist, hamming it up in every scene and never once feeling like a serious threat. This is another Netflix original to avoid if one values their time.I rate it 3/10",Polar

The plot is unremarkable, you've seen it dozens of times before, but the violent antics of Duncan (Mads M) and the Suicide Squad-like kill team are just shocking. Vanessa Hudgens attempts to ditch her cute-ness with a gritty drama role but it works about as well as dressing a kitten in a cowboy hat, still cute, sorry, so that's a casting miss and if you dwell on it too much can ruin the otherwise dark, violent vibe throughout.

Of course, Mads as one of the finest actors, portraying a layered character. The movie came as a surprise and I had a pleasant experience watching the movie . It's well written, executed and acted piece of cinema. The action sequences are well executed. Overall a very pleasant watch.What did not work:
I would have expected the protagonist to be more hateful than he is portrayed. Of course, he is not a typical psychopath we see in movies. Maybe a bit more of impulsive and guthless portrayal with the added screen time. Also, the movie shows too much coincidence with the female character; she being the girl who survived and also girl with the traumatic past. Just saying.

But the fact remain that as a movie, this feel so much like a John Wick clone its insane. You even have a joke at the beginning wich must be a nod to John Wick. Now that does not mean its a bad thing...I actually enjoyed the movie but it does have some flaws. First of all Mads Mikkelsen is great in the role of the soon to be retired Hitmen. The action scenes where plenty and pretty brutal. The main problem with the movie tough is the antagonists. Im guessing it comes from the graphic novel/comic book roots, and maybe this is the idea they wanted to show, but the vilains end up being so cartoonish and ridiculous at times that it definately drag down the movie.While John Wick did create its own world that seem far fetch from reality, it made it so interesting and a bit mysterious, you always wanted to know more about it. While in Polar, i didn't really cared that much about the assassin's organization and focussed more on the main character.In the end, i enjoyed this tale and the movie definately let things open for a potential sequel that i am interested to see for sure.

60,stevenrotherforth,A one eyed king in the land of the blind!,6,3 February 2019,"PolarPolar is yet another Netflix release to involve a credible Hollywood star.
After the success of Bright with Will Smith and Birdbox starring Sandra Bullock, Netflix seems to be on a roll.
Here they dabble in the action genre with a stylised clone of John Wick.
Polar is actually based on a Dark Horse Comic book series but it is undeniable that this movie shares common plot similarities with the Keanu Reeves action masterpiece.
Polar is no where near as good.
This movie adaptation of the comic stars the solid performer Mads Mikkelsen.
He is easily the best thing about this over the top action movie.
Not to say that the rest of the film isn't enjoyable but it does play heavy on the theatrics.
Mikklesen's character is a super duper assassin/hitman only days away from retirement.
He's due a rather tasty pension pot but the company he works for don't want him to cash out.
Matt Lucas plays the rather hammy company boss who doesn't want to pay him the owed eight million Mikklesen's character is due.
Lucas is often irritating making for a good villain.
When his comeuppance is due it is all the more satisfying.
A gang of young blood assassins are hired to stop Duncan (Mikklesen) reaching his fiftieth birthday.
What ensues is a action splatterfest that isn't original but is well executed.
Gore, sex and violence are abundant so it's not a movie for those who frequent the Hallmark channel.Jonas Akerlund's film is good looking movie.
Cinematography and editing are sharp.
The use of HDR is wonderful. Colours burst from the screen with over saturation making this one of Netflix's best 4K HDR presentations.
Usually over saturated colours are offensive but here it gives the film a comic book feel.
Also available with Dolby Atmos sound, Polar is a great workout for your Home Cinema set up.
Sure height speakers could have been better utilised but remember this is streaming content not 4K Blu-ray.
Polar isn't going to linger in the memory banks for very long but whilst it does it's one of Netflix's better offerings.

61,p-jonsson,Strange mix of thriller and comedy,8,28 January 2019,"This is a bit of a strange movie. Part of it feels like a pretty good, dark and gritty thriller, part of it feels like a wannabe Tarantino movie and part of it feels like a comedy. Overall I would classify it as a B-movie but a pretty good B-movie. As strange as the movie is I have to say that I liked it.I kind of watched this movie on a whim. It popped up on my Netflix home screen and I kind of liked the blurb. A type of story that I like. Then I saw that Mads Mikkelsen played the lead role and this sold me on it. I quite like Mads Mikkelsen in these kind of roles.The movie starts off in a fairly normal way for this kind of movie. You know, some assassinations, introduction of the hero, the bad guys, the even badder guys and all that. It is fairly clear already from the start that there will be blood splatter. That it would reach the levels it did towards the end of the movie was a bit of a surprise though.I did like Mads Mikkelsen in his role as Duncan, the somewhat brooding and grim assassin starting his retirement. But then I'm not really surprised. It's a perfect role for him. The rest of the actors, well let's just say that their acting was for the most part forgettable. Maybe with the exception of Matt Lucas as Blut. But then, his role was so comical and wacky so one wonders if it required acting skills or just a good dose of insanity (or some chemical products).The blurb states that he is deemed a liability. Well, that is not exactly the truth actually. It is more that his overly wacky boss is trying to screw him. This is where it starts to get into comedy land. Already in the first couple of scenes it is clear that this guy is a nut job. Then he let's loose his assassins and at that point the movie escalates in a orgy of blood, violence and comedy.I cannot really make up my mind if it would have been a better movie if the violence would have been less comical or not. With the comedy this movie becomes a bit unusual and sticks out. Without it it would risk becoming just another thirteen on a dozen assassin thrillers. Also, as comical as it is, it is fairly well done.Anyway, there is of course a pretty dramatic and violent fight as the movie draws to a close. I quite liked that one. There is also a little twist that I actually did not see coming at the end.Overall, it was a fun movie to watch.",Polar

I can understand why today's 'sensitives' in media might find it off-putting. There is a definite lack of subtle humor in the media-sphere these days. So, think dark comedy. Think the remarkable Mad Mads naked. Think of Matt Lucas as the sissy monster. Think of that sexy Viking amazon, Katheryn Winnick as the coolest of hit pimps. Think of a goofy villain posse whose arrogance is slapstick. Take a deep breath and relax. You'll enjoy the ride. This isn't Shakespeare. It's a comic book.

I feel like this movie will one of those movies that I enjoyed very much and the majority will nitpick at, and that's completely fine. I totally wasn't expecting what I'd call a twist, not completely sure if others will feel the same way, near the end of the movie. And the acting in that scene, after the twist was revealed, was fantastic. From both Mads Mikkelsen and Vanessa Hudgens. Especially hers. I was a bit surprised on how different she looks in real life as opposed to her appearance in the movie. She looks like a completely different person compared to her character. I actually think how she looked in the movie was more attractive than she is in real life, not that she isn't attractive outside of this movie.

68,jamiedarlow-37510,Frustratingly close to being really good,5,28 March 2020,"Tarnished by an uncomfortably poor first half. Duncan Vizla (Mads Mikkelson) is a highly trained assassin, the best of the best, who is looking forward to a long retirement. In the last two weeks of work life, he is called upon one last job and targeted by his former boss. I absolutely loved Director Jonas Akerlund's Small Apartments which was darkly brilliant with an amazing cast. I've been looking forward to Polar and Lord Of Chaos this year as these are both with him at the helm and there are definately shades of awesomeness here. The whole experience is let down by the first hour having pacing problems despite outrageous events happening on screen and a very distinct visual style (the title sequences are cool!). But underneath all the style is little substance. The low point is a needlessly gratuitous sex scene that, although undoubtedly erotic, just feels all of a sudden like you're watching porn and doesn't add anything to the story at all. Almost exactly half way through, the plot thickens and gets a bit juicier. After a purposefully harsh and brutal torture sequence, Duncan goes on a rampage which is probably the most exciting scene in the film; really intense and edge of your seat action, all the while without any soundtrack making it all the more impactful. I think the standout performance is Vanessa Hudgens as Camille, Duncan's neighbour with a bad history. It's a really sensitive portrayal of someone shattered by the harsh realities and abuse suffered in her past and I thought the relationship between her and Duncan reached really engaging territory in the final 10 minutes, making for a pretty impressive ending. There's also a certain amount of fun to be had for gore enthusiasts in the later stages. Other than that, the rest of the film just feels in bad taste and nasty; particularly the first half which was hard to sit through",Polar
69,DeBBss,A Lot of Minor Issues,5,19 October 2020,"Polar is quite an average hitman movie. It shares a lot of similarities when comparing it to the other movies of this genre. Polar actually surprised me; I originally thought that Polar would be a terrible movie, but it definitely held its own. There are several issues that I do have with Polar, mainly the characters and the story.First off, the antagonists are pretty bad. There's a mercenary team that's strange to say the least. The mercs lack in intimidation, they take nothing seriously and act like a bunch of goofy comic book characters; and their way of executing targets was poorly done. Blut is the main antagonist, and he just so happens to be the least intimidating character. The guy looks like he'd rather go 12 rounds with Dunkin' Donuts instead of 4 rounds with Duncan Vizla. I guess his character is supposed to be quirky, but he just looks like a jelly filled donut.The story is so average that it gets to the point where it's mediocre. We've seen a similar plot, like with John Wick; where you have a retired hitman going back in to finish something. The pacing is a little on the weak side. It gets very inconsistent near the end of film. But I do have to mention that the overall execution of the plot is pretty good.Polar is an okay movie in my opinion. It nails a lot of great things, but the characters and story isn't all that great. No one was intimidating, except Duncan Vizla. The story was average, but with a lot of minor issues. Overall, it's a great watch if you don't want to take the film too seriously.",Polar

First impression was that it seems to be stuck in that late nineties, early 2000's era of film making of in your face scenes, skimpily dressed, attractive women and action galore. It's not ashamed of what it is, it's not ashamed to cast good looking women and it's not ashamed to bring on the violence. Mads Mikkelson is perfect in this film, Kathryn Winnick and Ruby Fee are a joy to watch, the only negative was Matt Lucas. I seriously thought this guy was a last minute pickup from Starbucks. He was just awful. Turns out he has a long career in writing film, which maybe he should have stuck to. He just can't act. HIs performance reminded me of something you would see in middle school. I'm not sure if he was owed a favor or the director didn't want to work with him, but it was bad compared to everyone else's performance.I'd give this movie some awards but the Academy is too stuffy to do that, unfortunately. Many of the actors in this film were way better than actors who've won Best Actor before in movies.Definitely watch.",Polar
72,WalkdenEntertainment,Not your normal comic superhero...,3,24 March 2019,"A brilliant assassin, Duncan (Mads Mikkelsen), is just two weeks away from retirement. Duncan naturally accepts one last mission because he is the best of the best. During his newest mission, Duncan becomes a liability for the very company he works for. Duncan will now need to take matters to the next level as he is targeted by a younger group of assassins who all desire the high priced bounty on his head.For those who are not aware, Polar is in fact based on a well known comic book.To see actor Mads Mikkelsen star as a lead character based on a comic book is just awesome to witness, but I'm also not surprised given the actor's resume and work in previous films. I also compliment the film's style when it comes to the brainless action sequences.All other characters (including the main villain) that surround our lead, are extremely disappointing and some of the most ridiculous characters I have seen for some time. From our opening scene alone, I felt this film to be rather silly as characters just talk absolute nonsense.Polar as a plot is also nothing new- a professional hitman who suddenly becomes hunted down by his own group. Not to mention the hit squad who are on the hunt for Duncan are also painful to watch. I personally feel this film will be best enjoyed by true fans of the comic book series.Watching Polar I had hopes, wanting to see something so enjoyable that I would be excited to research the comic book, wanting to know more about Duncan and his world, but at the end of the credits, I had zero interest or desire to know more.Overall, Polar is a disappointing film. It's clear that fans of the comic book series will enjoy it the most but those seeking something new and exciting will only find ridiculous characters and a plot we have seen before. Mads Mikkelsen and the action are the best and only enjoyable element of this film. The rest of film is a complete mess with scenes that drag on and are utterly disappointing.

83,scb_coldsteel,A boring and unexpired action comedy that throws style over substance,3,3 March 2019,"So I watched Polar on Netflix. I haven't heard great things about the movie, but I love Mads Mikkelsen as an actor. Plus how could a gory action comedy about an aging hitman be bad? It turns out pretty easily because this was not a good movie in any regard.The movies plot follows the soon-to-retire hitman black Kaiser as he attempts to separate himself from the world of killing. He meets a nice girl at a small town volunteers at a local library. Of course the organization that employed him wants him dead so the movie explodes into a violent and sex filled murder rampage. Sounds familiar right?It's a very simple plot that we have seen a hundred times before. Of course that is just one of the many problems with the film. The film is a complete and utter lack of originality in any regard. The film is as predictable as humanly possible and filled with regurgitated tropes and cliches. Every single character had zero development and were nothing but cardboard cutout villains. Every major plot point seemed to be stolen from better genre films. A lack of originality doesn't mean a movie can't be fun however. Unfortunately there was still nothing fun about the execution or characterizations in the film.The execution of the film was laughably bad. Not in a fun way, but in a bad what were they thinking kind of way. The movie tried to be hyper violent and hyper-sexualized in a cool and edgy way that I'm sure a twelve year old would appreciate. Unfortunately anyone with a developed brain will quickly get bored of the the uninteresting and unnecessarily stylized aspects of the film.The movie just wanted to be so edgy and cool. The director threw every provocative scene at the audience just because, but it still was absolutely boring. It was like a terrible music video directed by a middle schooler with ADHD. Nothing really happened for a reason, it was just because everything tried to be so stylized. Of course it was all so forced it just came across as juvenile and boring.That being the films biggest sin. I can look past a lot of things as long as I'm being entertained, but Polar is boring, very very boring. It almost makes me mad that a film with such a fun premise would be so uninspired. How can you make an action movie with such poorly designed action scenes? How can you try to be funny when the jokes were juvenile and lowbrow? How can you try and be interesting when everything was predictable? It was all just so poorly done and boring.Speaking of uninspired the film doesn't have actors beside Mads Mikkelsen, it has stand-ins with terrible dialogue just waiting to be killed. Mikkelsen does his best with some absolutely terrible writing, but there is nothing he can do to save this movie. Also it makes me sad that Richard Dreyfuss had to be in this movie. Someone please hire that man for some actual work again.So was there anything I liked about Polar you may ask? I normally write a films strengths first, but Polar just didn't have any. This was just not a good movie. It was boring, predictable, cliche, and all around poorly made. Sure I can see a child liking this kind of uninspired drivel, but hey they should not be watching this kind of film in the first place. I don't care how old you are a bad movie is a bad movie.As you can tell I didn't like Polar. It failed pretty much every objective measurement of a well-made film. Hell I love fun poorly made films and this wasn't that either. It was uninspired and boring on every level. Bad Netflix, a 2.5 out of 10.",Polar

Yes the film is over the top. Yes it has lots of T and A. Yes it has loads of violence
In fact it's all of the above and it's done brilliantly.
This little note, so everyone pay attention, please. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was going to another John Wick, which I love by the way, but it's not. There was a film out in 2003 there was a film called Shoot Em Up with Clive Owen. A fantastic film by the way, Polar is in that vein. So if you like those films then you will love this film, I did.

86,PCT1970,Mikkelsen Is Polarizing,7,10 May 2019,"From the opening scene I knew I had viewed this style of direction before. I was right, as I have seen Akerlund's, ""Spun"" which is pronounced. That is a substantial film, but this film is much better if you enjoy the action genre. The basic premise has been seen before. I can go back as far as 1972's ""The Mechanic"". The direction, screenplay, cinematography and editing are considerable. The soundtrack is superb. As far as acting, Mikkelsen carries the entire film. Every other performance is over the top, but they sort of have to be. The entire plot is over the top and unrealistic, but that's what makes this film so much fun. It needs to be viewed for what it is. The film is action packed, graphic, violent, gritty, gory, intense, funny with a dash of Neo-noir. It is what should be expected when you have a lone seasoned assassin seeking retirement having to fend off a slew of younger less cunning, but more violent assassins looking to take their senior out per order of the head honcho. The plot has a little bit of a surprise ending, but if you've seen this type of film before, you can almost see it coming. As far as examining or scrutinizing the film there is the obvious insufficient retirement plans which many Americans suffer from. There is the cliche out with the old and in with the new in corporate America to save a buck for upper management, but in this viewer's opinion the film isn't meant to be probing. All in all Akerlund delivers the goods and helms one of the better films in this genre. Enjoy it for what it is intended to be which is an ultraviolent, exuberant, full throttle, bombastic, blazing blast.",Polar

88,RogerBorg,Sublime and ridiculous in equal measure,5,9 August 2020,"There are three separate films going on here.The first, and the best, features the always compelling Mads Mikkelsen; Katheryn Winnick's hypnotic eyes; and a shockingly committed performance from Vanessa Hudgens who brings some remarkable emotional substance to her role. It's worth watching for these three.Then there's the chaos-rampage of the assassin team, part Natural Born Killers, part Suicide Squad. All very well done and murderously jolly, but with a very different tone to Mikkelsen's grimmer scenes. Still, it's possible to enjoy the combination.The action sequences are solid, there's the now obligatory corridor fight, and all the minor roles are well cast and make the most of their scenes. So far, so good.But then there's Matt Lucas. Oh dear, Matt Lucas. The most awful mis-casting since Eddie Izzard in Mystery Men, and Lucas appears to think he's playing the villain in a superhero film here as well. There's no getting away from it, he's awful, is dressed like a clown (not the scary kind), has no presence, no range or nuance, and cuts a ridiculous figure without the hint of menace or malevolence that might have given the role some credibility.I just have no idea what happened here with the casting, script and most importantly the direction.What I do know is that Milkkelsen and Hudgens were superb, and Lucas was an unwatcheably campy ham-beast who came clear to wrecking the entire production, and he should never be cast in anything again outside of Christmas pantomime.On balance, I did enjoy the whole, but only because it was solidly bookended by Mikkelsen: Lucas didn't quite manage to sink the entire film, but he had a damn good try at it.",Polar

It should be noted that opionions are, of course, subjective and should be taken with a grain of salt. What I find sad is that people note elements of the film as being poorly done (eg acting, camera work, cinematography etc) and therefore did not like the movie, but to these eyes, there is very little about this film that is anything less than extremely well done, including the acting (and choice of actors playing the characters) which is extremely well done; cinematography is stunning, especially on the location shots; editing and post (including sound & foley) is on par with any blockbuster released these days...very impressive; pace is fabulous and basically grabs you by the short-n-curlies from the minute the lights dim until AFTER the credits (hint). Make no mistake...this is an action film, and action is what the viewer gets. I simply cannot fathom what it is that viewers who posted poor reviews expected, or wanted to see. There are, indeed, a couple of eccentric characters for which the actors' delivery might appear as ""over the top,"" and while they weren't necessarily realistic characters, the delivery was exactly as it should have been.All I can imagine is that the poor reviews are due to the improbable, impossible, and unrealistic aspects of certain elements and occurrences in the film. If that is the case, it's a bummer for those folks, as not every flick must be rooted in reality. When watching this, do yourself a favor and take the film at face value. Don't attempt to overexplain, poke holes, or continually quip how ""that could never happen,"" or it likely won't be an enjoyable experience. If you are able to take what you're given and simply ENJOY the movie for what it is, it's one blazer of an action flick!As with most of my reviews, I won't provide details on the synopsis and/or offer spoilers, but will speak to the content:
I noted and expressed opinion on production in the above paragraphs, but would add that this is, IMHO, Åkerlund's best film project to date. Without spoiling any important contents, one of the ideas I appreciated the most is that the protagonist does not have some sad back-story of love or family-lost...he just does it for the job. No sappy flashbacks of people running toward each other through fields of shin-high flowers, or other sub-motive for what he does. He just does it. Though, it is a little more involved than that.action is high grade, with substantial violence throughout the film. I would not say the gore content is high, as while there are a few gnarly scenes, it's mostly standard action blood, guns, knives, explosions, etc. BUT...there are some pretty cool and creative ""things"" you will see. If you want a fast paced action flick with a solid dose of violence (without a ton of gore) this is right up your alley.there are a few spots containing nudity (if I remember correctly), which is always a plus. They are not wasted or needless, however, and fit in with what occurs around them.plenty of profanity, though not overboard by any means.All in all, if you are a fan of the director, enjoy quality action films, or just like a good dose of violence & adventure, this film is for you. Just go in to it accepting that not everything you see must be 100% rooted in reality. If you can do that, this is well worth your time and I would even venture to say that you might want to watch it multiple times.",Polar
93,MoistMovies,was genuinely surprised how much i enjoyed this film,8,26 January 2019,"Mads is my favorite actor working today, so i've seen most of his films.
And being a schlock fan of some comic films, and knowing this was bease on a graphic novel. I went in with similar expectations.This is not a comic book films at all. Sure it takes some elements from shoot em' up and other films that segment their films by using large fonts to point out characters and scenes. But this one had way more heart than any other i had seen.A few comical type characters couldve been toned down a tad, and that wouldve created a more indepth feel of immersion for me. But i understand why the director chose that style since this is a graphic novel and they wanted to remind the audience of such.The villian is the weakest point, but still didnt take away from my enjoyment of the film.The acting by mads is perfect as all ways. He doesnt bruce willis it at all, even in non high budget films. And that makes me respect the man even more. From his highest budget films, to films that many high profile actors would read the lines and do nothing else. He is always consistently a professionally great actor. A rare breed, truly.If you go in, not expecting the next citizen kane, this will be truly entertaining. The type where some plot holes dont really matter, and that the stroy being told works, if you shut your over critical thoughts off a little bit.",Polar

Somewhat reminiscent of the classic flick ""The Professional"", this is a way over-the-top look at depravity that is carried well by the lead protagonist somehow maintaining his humanity through it all.",Polar

97,dcobbimdb,Unique in it's own way,7,15 February 2019,"I really liked certain parts, others just okay, and yet others almost made me turn it off. However I was entertained throughout, which for me is the biggest measuring stick for how good a movie is. Basically it's John Wick, Sin City, and Die Hard all rolled into one, with Starship Troopers type humorFar as acting & characters, I'm not really familiar with Mads, other than noticing he was the bad guy in Dr. Strange, where I thought he was just okay, here though I thought he was great and perfectly cast. I've only seen Vanessa in High School Musical (yeah, I know...), so very different role for her here and she was decent given her recluse character. Sindy was obviously some nice eye candy, but the other villains were more or less unlikable & forgettable. Especially the boss villain, OMG I was hoping one of his own goons would wack him as he was so annoying and IMO the biggest weakness in this movie by far. I like eccentric bad guys that you love to hate, this fat slob was just idiotic and so painful to watch and sit through his scenes. No idea what they were trying for, but it certainly failed for me and had he been given more screen time would have completely killed the movie.Far as flow, it was hit and miss but always entertaining. On the one hand it's hysterical you get introduced to the main character as he's getting a rectal exam, and the movie takes itself serious at times, and then it does a total shift to the goon squad, and their blundering idiot boss. I like action, grit and gore, but the torture scenes were a bit much for me and on par with the 2011 film Unthinkable, which was a great movie, but poorly timed...Overall I liked the film and while I typically don't like sequels unless it's organic and how the story was originally designed, in this case I liked how it ended and would certainly tune in if they ever make a part 2",Polar

poor Expressions. Like when he killed the Mexican. The fat guy didn't convince me that he was in pain. Watch the scene you'll know why. 😂 or maybe its just me but most of the expressions didn't convince me.2nd thing is:
The ending. Or specifically what's happened after he saved the girl. I hated the fact that the unappreciative bit** didn't at least thank him.
At least appreciate him risking his freaking life for your ugly face😒.Final thing is:

108,joker-4,Crazy film perfect for a Tuesday night,7,15 August 2019,"A good action movie is like a classic meat-and-potatoes meal; standard fare that although might be seasoned differently is both filling and unsurprising. Occasionally a genre-breaking film will surprise everyone and pop open a bottle of Malbec to serve with a little filet mignon. Usually? The plot, situation, even the action itself, is as recycled as a hot dog washed down with a Coors Light. Forgettable. Ordinary. Monotonous. Then there is Polar.The film is Irish-carbomb crazy; chopped meat that's charbroiled yet still pink-on-the-inside, along with plenty of extra cheese.The film's plot is insanely generic. Older hitman seeks retirement but his boss won't let him go. In fact, said boss, a maniacal Matt Lucas who was given free reign of Elton John's wardrobe circa 1987, would much rather see Duncan (Mads Mikklesen) dead than pay him his owed bank. A squad of diverse goons head out in hopes of retiring Duncan in cleverly ridiculous ways only to discover - shock - that old Duncan is more wily than initially estimated. Silliness ensues.The slick camera-work and kinetic editing is an over-the-top, ADD-infused assault. Think Tony Scott helming John Wick. Adapted from a Dark Horse graphic novel and directed by Jonas Åkerlund, Polar looks like a full-length Rammstein music video, albeit scored by Deadmau5, and comes complete with Instagram-worthy title cards.The film is soaked with annoying characters, absurd situations (Richard Dreyfuss on karaoke, anyone?), and a devilish weapon-fetish. Duncan, however, hi-jacks the film with his heart of plated gold, a desire for a pet, and the smooth handling of an axe.Every plot point was slashed to bits with a dull sword. Betrayals were telegraphed as subtlety as a missile strike. And the ending was as secure as an A-Team mission. Through all that, Polar is deep-fried fun that makes an otherwise-forgettable Tuesday night slightly more memorable.If only there were an explanation of the film's title...",Polar

Ok, that's enough for praising the looks, let's check what is under the hood of this ride.The problem is that every ""cool"" modern movie wants to resemble a comic book, however, it gets too shabby over time and the 2019 clock shows that it's too late. Further into the show we see less text intervention and get the taste of vapid story of a retiring killer. There is an outcry to such a blunt plot by an attempt to spice it up with adding an eccentric boss but he just doesn't fit into the picture. Through all that exorbitant amount of unnecessary gore and sex you can see some neat prospects of good action but everything gets immediately chopped by untold stories and grotesque behavior of the characters.I would like to find something really great about the picture but I've got only three perks: Mads Mikkelsen, fetus of a nice background narration and a pinch of quality fights.

Basically the theme of the whole movie is Duncan/Mads Mikkelsen is awesome and everyone else is sloppy and reckless. The director obviously was a pretty big fan of Mads and this is sort of Mads shot at the lead role, and I thought he really kicked ass as the lead man. While watching this movie I kept thinking that when the Bond franchise decided to go with Daniel Craig, Mads Mikkelsen must have been in the running and I would go as far as to predict that he was the runner-up in which he was awarded the villain role in Casino Royale, and I sense a James Bond chip on his shoulder as he plays this character Duncan Visla who is basically the Michael Jordan of assassins. Something about his acting in this movie tells me he wanted to play James Bond and would have done a pretty great job of it.

123,seige-hound,"Decent mix of John Wick and Red, not as good as either.",4,30 January 2019,"Probably the best way I can describe this movie is a mixture of John Wick and RED, however I would argue it doesn't quite match up to either of those. Not to say the film is a bad action flick at all, but personally I felt the tone was all over the place.Like the two films I mentioned, Polar is about an older, rugged assassin who is targeted by a secret service he used to work for. I like this genre in general, the super-assassin who is able to overcome any adversity, and while he does make mistakes, he overcomes them with sheer willpower. However, one thing that irks me about this film in particular is how the villains SEVERELY underestimate the main character.This is something John Wick knows well. EVERYONE in JW's universe knows who he is and what he is capable of, which is why the villain in John Wick is somewhat sympathetic. He knows that his arrogant son made a mistake that put the entire organization in danger, but he seeks to protect his son anyway. That's a good motivation, and makes for a great antagonist.The antagonist in Polar is a bumbling idiot who is somehow in charge of this massive organization of master assassins, develops this scheme to avoid paying his retirees severance by killing them before their retiring age (which is 50 for some reason) and at multiple times severely underestimates the abilities of the man he's fighting. It's pathetic, really, and doesn't make me care much about the story or the characters, or the main conflict.Like RED, the film also shows a romantic infatuation that develops between the main character and a younger woman he meets, who then becomes involved in the plot. However, RED's female lead acts as a foil to the main character, sharing great chemistry with the main character and sharing several comedic scenes, which doesn't happen at all really in Polar.Not to say the film doesn't at all attempt to be humorous. The antics of the secondary antagonists, a group of young assassins who are assigned early in the film to kill the main character, have several 'comedic' scenes, and by comedy, I mean scenes where they torture and kill random civilians in gory detail while laughing and screaming. This film, after all, has a serious tonal issue, and it seems to think all violence, save for against the main character, is funny. This might work for 13 year olds, but I'm past that for the most part.Overall, this film is fine. Nothing really special, and there are better action movies, but if you want to watch some mindless violence, this would be a good choice.",Polar

First and foremost, this is a terrible movie, not one ounce of anything redeeming including script, producing, or acting. The entire production seems like something a High School freshman would do, amateur in every sense of the word. Regarding what some call an action movie, if you find no story to hang your hat on and scene after scene of people getting killed and tortured the main elements of an action film than here's where we must part ways. I would rank this film in the genre of the slasher type movies, but unlike a typical slasher movie, this mindless trite is so violent and actually disturbing that to watch this crap instantly makes you dumber.

The plot was good and leaned towards a twist that was revealed perfectly at the end. The action was well paced and brutal and the comedy was dark and well delivered. IMDB giving it low ratings is just disgraceful. Vanessa Hudgens actually made herself look sort of plain-Jane and mormonish but underneath it all she's a total beaut.

I often like these types of movies. Everything is just so poorly delivered here. So many things are not necessary and bring no satisfaction whatsoever. Many of the action scenes are so staged that they might as well have put puppets in as the main characters opponents. And the attempts at some humor are downright pathetic.

154,CaptRon-2,Ridiculous movie and written by non-accountants,2,28 January 2019,"I can't say enough bad about this movie, especially with a couple of well-known names attached to it. Before I start to rip it though, I want to say how sad for Richard Dreyfus, if anyone know where his Go Fund Me account is setup, let me know and I will donate so he never has to be another movie like this.SPOILERS AHEAD (the move is a spoiler of time):The premise is a company that does personal protection and assassinations globally. It is a privately held company through multiple generations. It has a matching pension account (very important plot point), and a clause that assassins retire at age 50 (again a very important point to this meaningless movie).As you might have guessed, assassin retires, assassin gets assassinated. Strangely, none of the other assassins make the connection that their co-workers all die right as they reach retirement. They also all seem to be blissfully unaware that a clause in their pension plan state that if they should die without a beneficiary, the company will receive the benefits (again, sadly, another important plot point).The whole plot of this movie is that the owner is selling the company and has identified a $29M liability that he wants to turn into an asset. The prospective buyers even ask about the odd accounting and he flat out tells them he is going to kill the retirees (not a disclosure I would recommend on anyone's annual report). Thus we focus on the lead character, 14 days from retirement and about to receive $8M in retirement. The company owner doesn't want to be out the money but he is treating the entire plan as if it is his money he is losing. Remember, the company only matched half the max contribution so it reality, the company only participated in ~ $1.75 million dollars, the rest came from the employee who has been investing the full amount for 20 years and had great returns (according to the accountant). The show's writers want you to think that the payout is all company money.Let's have some fun with the numbers:
1. The pension is paid all an once! Why I have no idea but the tax liability would be enormous.
2. A large international company with it's own army is focused on saving $29M in the company pension plan. The buyers should see red flags everywhere
3. The liability and the asset are not the same. The company didn't put $8M into the plan, just a small fraction of (as stated above). Assuming everyone did the same, the company's exposure over 20 years was approx. 30 percent. The rest came from employees and market investments.
4. While $8M is a lot of money, it pales compared to their salaries. The last job paid $2M and we know our lead character has been working 20 years and been to 99 countries. If we assume that a regular job only paid 10 percent of that, $200k and only 1 assassination per country, that would be $19,800,000 over his career.As for the rest of the movie, it is just stupid. A girl the assassin spared comes back to kill him but decides to spare him because he chopped her firewood and gave her college money.Main character is captured, tortured and denied food and water for 4 days but is able to break free and kill a trained army of ~100 guards.All women have sex before killing people...I guess that is how the writers see women, how sad.Female character is kidnapped and given so much heroin that even Keith Richards would say no. Days later she is perfectly fine.The lead villain is about as scary as the Stay Puff Marsh-mellow Man (and looks like him too).The police do not exist in this movie. You can shoot people, blow things up, and drive at insane speeds and nary a cop to be found. The only place the police show up is in Russia - Go Russian Police lolBad Netflix, bad",Polar

Sometimes garish, other times solemn, this would be a typical B grade action film with any other actor in the lead role. However, Mikkelsen exudes a steely menace throughout, always a good quality to have when portraying a highly skilled assassin. A gunfight in the snow and a mass brawl in a tunnel are the action highlights, but too much of the rest of the film is directed in a basic and humdrum manner. Mikkelsen is fast becoming one of my favourite actors; here, he strides through the proceedings like a Scandinavian Clint Eastwood, not talking much but making his actions speak louder than words. It's time he had a much better movie to his name.",Polar

The characters have a lot of unique style, but I felt they were too much over-the-top and didn't translate well in this movie. You could argue that they are polar-opposites to the protagonist, who is more grounded, but I didn't think it worked. If the action/comedy had much of the same amount of comic book style then I might feel differently, but as-is they don't mix well (imagine the next Bond film with a flamboyant street pimp as the villain, it detracts from the overall concept).I also agree that the editing needed some work, and a sizable chunk could've been cut to make it tighter.

I really enjoyed Mads Mikkelsen's stoic performance, which made for a bunch of weirdly humorous scenes. As stated above, the soundtrack by Deadmau5 was also quite decent and accentuated the more serious scenes very well.With that said, the tone of this movie was extremely inconsistent, fluctuating between serious and desaturated looking scenes and dazzling shots of some exaggerated characters killing people. The editing felt immature as well and the main story was just mind-bogglingly dumb: His boss wants to kill Mads in order not to have to pay him his pension and risks the expensive lives of all his other agents while doing so - who could have seen this coming anyway, working for an agency called ""Damocles""?While a lot of reviewers have stated obvious similarities to JOHN WICK, the film reminded me way more of those trashy and crazy violent movies from the early 2000s like CRANK, SMOKIN' ACES or GAMER.

173,smithpaulusmc,Fun For (Not) The Whole Family,6,11 February 2019,"Over the last decade, directors and producers have elected comic books and graphic novels as the lifeblood and source material for an increasing number of cult classic and blockbusters. Disney and Marvel joined forces to produce the Marvel Cinematic Universe while DC struggled to pull in even half as many sales. Filmmakers we might call ""indie"" have gotten in on the action too. Director Jonas Åkerlund opted to adapt Victor Santos's 2012 webcomic Polar as a Netflix original film bearing the same name.The plot follows Kaiser Black (Mads Mikkelsen), the world's deadliest assassin as he retires from his life of mischief. Due to a clause in his contract stating that, should he die before his retirement age, all of his money would be returned to his employer Blut (Matt Lucas). The concept promised daring pursuits and mind boggling conspiracy, but instead, we received a blood gurgling murderfest with no real moral lesson or lasting impression. However, that does not mean each of Kaiser Black's kills aren't entertaining. They simply feel like dollar menu adaptations of John Wick and Scott Pilgrim.Mikkelsen shines remarkably through the flick's cold and eary surface. Vanessa Hudgens' character Camille is entirely unremarkable, giving speeches that feel more like middle school stage monologues than quality acting. The most irksome character is the film's antagonist Blut. He appears so entirely despicable and grotesque that the audience cannot identify with him even for a moment. We are not supposed to love him, but we should at least understand him.If Polar were removed from an Oscar judges scrutiny and handed to the American teenager, he would note only how much he enjoyed it. That is because at face value, Polar delights the eyes and the ears. Its colors are vivid and dynamic while its overall sound, produced by deadmau5, is mesmerizing. There are moments of genuine emotion nestled between the pulpy noir frames. This film should not be judged for its merits, but for its ability to remove you from planet Earth for two hours.

175,LBarlane24,Atomic Blond + Smokin Aces = THIS,2,28 May 2019,"Directed by the same jackass who directed Spun, Polar is a (supposed) Neo-noir action film that stars Mads Mikkelsen, Vanessa Hudgens, Kathryne Winnick and (a miscast) Matt Lucas.Now how do I start this off? So there's this guy, Duncan, who is apparently a retiring assassin. He meets Camile, a young woman, at a convenience store of some sort. Meanwhile, a gang of other assassins are, I guess, hired by this other guy, a criminal mastermind (who makes Oswald Cobblepot look like the Mountain from GOT) along with some femme fatale. Yeah, it's as boring as it sounds.ACTING - Let my start by saying that three of the actors (that of course being Mikkelson, Hudgens, and Winnick) look beyond bored every two seconds; they looked even more bored than I was. Not only that, Mikkelson and Hudgens have little to no chemistry.WRITING - Oh boy, where do I begin? First off, I've not read the graphical this film is based on, but surely the writing in it is ten times better than this. The two leads are two dimensional, the villains are caricatures, and the supporting characters are, well, just extras, nothing more.DIRECTION - I will be honest and say that it is not the worst I've ever seen, but it is still pretty bad. What can I say about the editing or than it sucks? It should go without saying that this film lacks a consistent tone, sometimes its melodramatic, other times it's an over the top action flick. I should also mentioned the gratuitous sex scenes in this. The opening scene features a chick exiting a pool and ... you could probably figure out the rest. Another scene features the main character in bed with, I guess, a widowed Russian mother, and it's as explicit as you can imagine. Yet another scene features the main character having sex with one of the assassins (specifically the chick in the opening), and it's even more explicit than the other two; yeah, the actress was basically there for no reason other than to serve as eye candy.VERDICT - This is a bad film, not just because it doesn't have an identity, but also because it has no worth while quality; I drank at least three cups of coffee just to stay awake. It has T&A alright, but it's purely just to distract us from the boring plot. Unless you have the IQ of a 13-year-old, this film is in no way worth your time, and I give it a solid D.",Polar

Overall I was very very surprised how much I enjoyed this film. Kept putting it off...I mean it has Vanessa Hudgens in it? How good a ""hitman"" movie can it be with her in it right??? She kills it in this role. Obviously a very talented actress. She was powerful and strong and her character was probably the focal point of the entire movie.",Polar

Really?Polar is the sort of degenerate filth that could only be produced by a dying culture at the end of empire, with a screenplay that could have been written by Caligula, or gleefully commissioned by him at any rate.Of course, the real source of inspiration for this black hole of soul-sucking moral nihilism masquerading as 'camp' is the modern-day internet porn industry, which has mainstreamed the eroticization of sadistic violence against women and made misogyny 'cool' again - made it 'normal' for an already exploitative sex-scene to (literally) climax with the woman being shot to death by an automatic weapon.I saw a review of Polar the other day that called people who complained about this sort of thing ""preachy"" and said the movie was ""boyish fun"". Actually think about that for a minute. Think about the fact that you live in a world where someone objecting to the equation of male sexual climax with murder as ""boyish fun"" is considered ""preachy"" or ""uptight"". Then think about your daughter, or your sisters, growing up in this world. Think about your sons, for that matter, actual little boys.

It's a good balance.Then there's the weird, never ending, early nineties skin flick part of this that just...isn't required? There's just no need for the outfits, the nudity, or the sex - things I am not in the slightest bit opposed to, mind, but which seem like a pitch to an audience that stopped existing decades ago. The director also seems wholly disgusted by his villain being kind of overweight, and takes pains to try and ensure we, the audience, are as well. It's the effort to gross out that detracts, not Matt Lucas (Blut).There's just an incredible amount of crap slathered over a shoot'em up redemption story that I think a lot of folk, and certainly I, could have done without. Hopefully, Mads tries his hand at this kind of role again - he and Vanessa Hudgens were terrific together, and the quieter story they were involved in would have made a much better skeleton to build the movie around. It's on Netflix, so all you'll be spending is time, I guess it might be worth some of yours?

The guy (Duncan) in Polar gets stabbed and shot a lot more times than John wick yet is still kicking everyone's ass. A sniper is shooting at his cabin then 5 seconds later Duncan is above the sniper with a gun. It does not make it a very good action movie. The main guy organizing the assassinations is a fat ugly weirdo who acts extremely feminine and he's always putting lotion on his hands.

Mads Mikkelsen does his absolutely best with this trash script and direction, and he basically keeps the movie from becoming a total trainwreck. Had this movie focused on a singular tone or style, it would have been much better, but you go from scenes of body mutilation to goofy fat crime-boss and I'm just like ""Is this supposed to be funny?

There are also a bunch of lackeys to the crime boss who are introduced as a kind of rogues gallery but they barely factor into the movie to the point where you wonder if their scenes were cut.

213,ultimatenexus,Oddball Mishmash of Ideas that Have All Been Used Before,6,26 January 2019,"The second I saw the trailer on Netflix and realized that Mads Mikkelsen was a retired assassin, I was instantly on board. Mikkelsen is a treasure, and I'll watch anything that has him in a starring role (thus promising that he won't be disgustingly underused like he was TWICE in 2017, in Rogue One and Dr. Strange).Watching this movie is like watching Mads Mikkelsen on the home set of the Hannibal series as he slices ideas and dices genre cliches and blends them all in a juicer into a colourful, blood-tinged cocktail with the delicate finesse of a chef. Unsurprisingly, Mikkelsen is the best thing about this movie.The assassins goof around, yell, do drugs, have sex, and act like entitled rich kids who I guess we're supposed to find funny. And then there's Mikkelsen--he's the straight man in this weird yet basic film that constantly shifts tones between colourful and trendy to muted and gritty. The irony here is that the funniest moments are all from him.Sometimes, the cinematography is gorgeous to look at. Other times, it looks like an unpleasant, rainbow-y candy-coloured glob of chewed bubblegum. The assassins and the big boss man are all obnoxious, snarky, and in serious need of a new fashion trend--they all looked like they stepped out of a sex shop with anything and everything that was bright yellow, pink, orange, or purple.The villain himself is a disappointment--they say an action hero is only as good as the villain he's at odds against. Here, Mikkelsen, a calm, regretful, reserved old man battles a cartoonish egomaniac and his army of loudmouthed decadent fools. Somewhere in this clash of two very different worlds, there is a good joke to be told. Sometimes, yes, the joke was funny, and most of the time, the film overall was pretty entertaining despite its out-of-place juvenile humour.Ex-Disney Princess Vanessa Hudgens surprised me, though. She made a very convincing performance as Mikkelsen's troubled, depressed neighbour, although in the final half of the film she doesn't get much to work with.The action scenes are stylish, gory, brutal as hell. A couple of times I laughed at the absurd, creative deaths Mikkelsen's character dished out. THey're filmed and edited well, and like the film itself, they're not bad, though not great, either.There is no other way for me to describe Polar except to crack a bad pun and say that it is a polarizing film. It lives up to its title. I can't say I can be disappointed by that. Well played.",Polar

Mads shoulders his role as expected, but not more than adequately. I haven't seen Vanessa Hudgens in anything else, but she doesn't impress here, though she doesn't have much to work with. Åkerlund really needed to get something else out of her performance as she faces Mads dim acting.

Can it push what's been done previously out further than expected and do it with style and verve?The answer here is a resounding yes. The movie is very entertaining but quite masculine to the point that I don't imagine many women will enjoy it with the possible exception of being able to see Mikkelsen's naked butt.This movie is a bit like John Wick tries the outdoors. The villains are wonderfully evil and the ladies involved are all hypnotic to look at. The action scenes are as well planned and executed as any other well produced movie.

But Jonas Åkerlund is no Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie, or even a Chad Stahelski. You'll probably remember the first two, maybe Stahelski will go on to make enough of a name for himself as well, but Jonas Åkerlund will have to make something actually worth watching to deserve being remembered for feature films instead of music videos.The style of Nicolas Winding Refn is so cool because it's wrapped around something truly dark and gritty or menacing. The violence in Tarantino's movies is palatable because it is an accessory in great story-telling with unparalleled dialog. The twists in Guy Ritchie's successes work because you're invested in the setting and the characters. And Stahelski gets a script by Derek Kolstad to work with, who understands what is needed to embed an anti-hero like John Wick, without getting in the way of hyper-stylized action. Polar has none of that, it's all 6/10 form without substance.Which is not to say it's not well-made and it has its moments. But the terrible casting, the complete lack of a plot worth caring about and the genericity of the action scenes ruin enough of it not to want to recommend it.

Wrap colorful corporate headhunter characters with their exciting, exotic and dangerous jobs around kinky combo of at moments altruistic professional brilliant-as-ever Mads Mikkelsen and you'll get the idea. All is packed in perfect modern production with adequate sets, music, kinky details and effects...
This movie based upon a graphic novel gives us extravagant antagonists - vivid villains from the global underground top murder elite syndicate in search and rush to kill the best of them who just went to retirement. Story is a bit thin but delivers a potent plot.
Thanks to its simplicity, the way is paved for the perfect fast-tempo drama and scenario (always in challenging environments/locations) and finally a chain of set-ups for the mind-blowing culmination. But in a very exciting manner it prolongs the climax and goes on; stretching and broadening the viewer's insight. When one would say it's a usually perfect moment for finish - it goes on (hurray for the writer!)
So, the movie is full-on action contemporary with interesting unexpected and colorful twists with specially ugly and wicked type of murdering psyches of all of them. But I mentioned how protagonists ugly/harsh toughness is in a funny way confronted with emotive softness inside.
In the end, being contemporary fast and thick with action, it makes ""tough-guy oldie pearls"" like Commando or Rambo feel ancient.",Polar

What saves it from one star is the ecxellent performanceof Mads Mikkelsen",Polar

237,mike_moor,"Dark but enjoyable, interesting and funny",8,21 September 2019,"This is a story of a lone wolf doing things his way. A character mired in mystery. A no kind of nonsense guy. The kind that usually makes the ladies weak in the knees. The lead actor in this movie is really interesting, a really bad guy but in all of this he still has some tender humanity left in him. This all blends together seamlessly into an interesting story. If you like a good action flick this movie will deliver, but keep in mind that it is a dark movie with brutal, savage scenes which may not be for everybody.The humour in this movie is quirky and sometimes downright bizarre. A very dark movie but it has its funny moments. The absurdity of the humour creates an interesting narrative not found in many other movies and is refreshing if you compare it to the many humdrum block busters they release constantly. None of the actors are trying to be funny with quirky lines and creepy jokes, and yet some of its whacky characters are very funny and enjoyable to watch.A great, refreshing action flick and something out of the ordinary.",Polar

241,jdowney-57-371157,This is Dark Horse Comics,7,28 July 2019,"Underlying the flaws of this movie are the restrictions forced on it by the genre. This is a Dark Horse Comic movie, so the villains are Comic Book villains. And the story is a comic book story, somewhat predictable and with a twist at the end.A hitman has a contract out on him. Pretty standard. He deals with it. There is a ton of violence. There is a 'love interest' in the story sense of that word, that makes him vulnerable.They style of the movie is surreal cuts/graphics/colors that match up with the cartoonish badguys. That contrasts with Mads playing the kind of stoic subdued anti-hero that he is so good at. So you get a bit of a mash up here with a Tim Burton set of enemies, a John Wick level reach the boss gamer sensibility and a dramatic thriller.The structure suffers with the boss level approach. The best set of bad dudes that you are setup to expect a lot from go down too soon. The end of level boss is mostly hot air.Other reviews are correct, this movie could have gone all out and made Duncan (Mads) as surreal as everyone else and just gone with it. Or it could have rewritten the comic book to make the baddies more realistic. Either way you would have had something pretty good.I usually like Vanessa Hudgens but she overplays it here as a scared little girl.
Katheryn Winnick makes a great cynical mobster chick and wish she had had a meatier role in the story. The rest of the baddies team are a diverse bunch of stereotypes who look good but don't get to shine. Matt Lucas (The Big Boss, named Blut) does not bother me, he plays the role the way it is meant to be played, way over the top.This is a good cast in a stylish attempt that is somewhat hampered by the material and structure of the film, which is too long. I will give it a 7 because it is over 6.",Polar

247,charliegeeza,"A messy, confused, frustrating experience",4,29 January 2019,"I struggled to finish watching this film. The casting varies from excellent to absurd. None of the bad guys worked aside from Katheryn Winnick (of Vikings fame). Especially unfunny and terribly cast is Matt Lucas who just detracts from every scene he appears in, there was nothing humourous about his character or his grotesqueness and his believability as some criminal mastermind never gets off the floor.I know the film is striving to have a comedic tone but the subtler humour offered by Mads Mikkelsen set against his rather dark and serious character is much more effective than the buffoonery that the other side of the story generally offer up.Mikkelsen and Vanessa Hudgens put in strong performances and when the film focuses on them their story and characters are compelling. Winnick lights up the rather trashy counterpiece scenes, and the transitions between the scenes are as jarring as they are in your face so that further disrupts the enjoyment.I honestly feel you could remove the footage of bad guys except for Winnick up until they collide with the protagonist (Mikkelsen) and the film would have been better for it. The goofiness and stupidity, the bright colours and bad acting offered nothing than an annoyance.",Polar

That strong face and long meaningful looks he gives are so intense. I kind of like the quirk of this movie but it was overdone and became cartoonish, especially with Matt Lucas (aka Tweedledee/Tweedledum). They should've cast somebody that had more of a psychopathic killer look to him/her to actually have any real threat behind this character. The villain (Martin Csokas aka Quinn) in the first season of Into the Badlands would've been great in this role. Or even something like Pollyanna McIntosh's character Angel as she was portrayed in the first season of Hap and Leonard. Oh well. I still enjoyed every scene with Mads Wick/Bourne/Mikkelsen.",Polar
250,TreasureHunterGirl,Mads & Vanessa Saved This Movie,5,21 May 2019,"Watching Polar was like watching two movies at once. There was the boring, lame movie starring a band of generic villains and then the good, interesting movie starring Mads Mikkelsen and Vanessa Hudgens.I get that it's based on a comic book and that the filmmakers tried to stylise it to match that, but the problem was that they just didn't execute it very well. I don't have anything against this type of movie. In fact, Sin City is one of my favourite movies, and it nailed the comic book stylisation. The problem with this movie was it wasn't cohesive. The two parts just didn't mesh well.
The thread that followed the assassins was so lame. They barely had characters. They were just annoying and boring. Their actions at times made no sense. They knew what the guy they were looking for looked like so why did they go around killing and torturing his tenants who'd most likely never laid eyes on him?!It's a real shame because Mads and Vanessa had good characters. They acted well and were interesting to watch. The twist at the end was really good. I didn't expect that at all. Even the sets and locations in this part of the movie were better. It's so bizarre.The final showdown with Matt Lucas' character was so disappointing. After all the pointless violence in the rest of the movie why didn't we get to actually see the main villain's death? The one death that actually meant something.Admittedly, after all the things wrong with this movie the ending was a decent payoff. It turned it from a movie I was really starting to hate to one I thought was okay.",Polar
251,torroutedipz,Will be waiting for Polar Vol. 2,8,27 January 2019,"Was it realistic...no, most action movies aren't. Was it entertaining...absolutely! For all the 1&2 star reviews all I can ask is ""what did you think you were about to watch?"". Clearly if you're posting reviews I would assume you read them as well, and look at cast line ups. When I sat down to decide which, usually mediocre at best, Netflix or Amazon movie I would watch, this popped up as new. I read the Netflix synopsis and thought it would be ok, but wasn't sure if I was in the mood for an action flick that was too dramatic. Then I looked on IMDb and saw how the cast was laid out, and it was obviously going not going to be that type of movie when I saw the assassins would be a group of hot females. It had very high violence and sexual ratings so I figured ""sure, I can do this."". The movie immediately gave me a Kill Bill type vibe, and that is pretty much the type of movie it is. For those who didn't pick up on this before the movie from the ratings or within the first few minutes, your lack of perception is on you. The quality and acting alone is worth a 5, but I found it nicely paced and entertaining, with an unexpected twist (I thought for sure Camille would be his daughter) so I give it a solid 7/8. There's nothing I can point out as being ""wrong"" with the movie. It is as advertised; an over the top action movie with violence and sex, and it makes for a great watch. If this isn't the type of movie you want to watch, then don't watch it. Don't watch it and rate it 1 star while complaining of the action and violence, you've been forewarned.",Polar
252,cheeftanz,Solid Netflix two hours ...,8,25 January 2019,"I thought the actors were fantastic, almost all of them. Vanessa Hudgens would be the outlier... she was miscast.Yes, the editing was sloppy, and many of the scenes were too long... specifically the long torture tribute which was just bizarre and reeked of stupidity.However, even with all the missed potential, there was always enough going on to keep us interested. Wonderful costumes, beautiful sets, sumblime photography and beautifully arranged scenes were just a few of the nuggets, we ever have a cameo from Richard Dreyfuss!If you are not squeamish, and violence is no problem I would recommend this movie ... absolutely not acceptable for my mom or the kids ...",Polar
253,hereinmycar,Ignore the critical reviews,6,25 January 2019,"Ok, let's get the negative things about this film out of the way.Firstly, Matt Lucas as a psychopathic boss of a bunch of assassins? No, no no! It really doesn't work, even if you can see what the casting crew were trying to achieve.Secondly, there is a lot of blood and gore that's unnecessary. However, this is a film about assassins! So it's hardly likely to be flowers and romance.Finally, the efforts to make this some kind of hybrid John Wick/Suicide Squad movie just doesn't quite work. It falls somewhere in between, which is god knows where!It's not as bad as the critics make out. After all, these are the same critics who loved Star Wars The Last Jedi! I think Mads plays the lead role well and there are some other good performers in there too. Richard Dreyfuss pops up in one scene, which was random!The cutting isn't great and it does crash around a bit, which is distracting. But the atmosphere is almost there and the cinematography is almost there too.And that's what I'd probably say about the whole film.....almost there.

This movie almost feels like a combination of 2 styles, one serious old school style of mads, and a comic book graphic style of the other assassins trying to kill him.

Hudgens wasn't bad, she seems to slowly be growing as an actress but she just didn't have the requisite charisma to match Mikkelsen's assassin who was reminiscent of Jean Reno in The Professional. Part of this was the fault of the script, but I wish her role lived up to his.At any rate, ignore the critical reviews if you like that era and genre. If you are offended by comic book violence or any of the films I mentioned, then I'd steer clear of this one.Make a sequel Netflix!",Polar

298,gsurveil1,Netflixs John Wick,9,1 February 2019,"To say that ""Polar"" is Netflixs version of John Wick is not a fair statement. Polar, like Wick, is based on a graphic novel about a retired assassin "" The Black Keiser"", excellently portrayed by the great Mads Mikkelsen. I won't spoil you with the details, but, I will say while waiting on JW3, Polar is perfect to fill that void of emptiness, you know, murder, violence and good old gun battles! I'm not saying it's on Wick's level (4-5 years to create and training). This was at least closer to it than atomic blonde. Mads is a straight badass and always has been, go check out The Salvation, Age of Uprising, Pusher and the badass, Valhalla Rising! Damn I got goosebumps on that last one. To say his work speaks for itself and for Netflix to pick him as the main character of this action film. Vanessa Hudgens does rather well at portraying the introverted neighbor. This is an action packed wild ride with crazy quirky characters and assassins. Again, this is why Netflix continues to dominate the streaming world and gives Hollywood studios bad dreams when they try to sleep. Polar isn't perfect, but it's far better than what any other medium has to offer.! So check it out and thank the gods we have Netflix!",Polar

308,RageQuitLeigh,Has a bit of everything,7,6 February 2021,"Polar is a graphic novel adaptation that provides a little bit of everything. Action set pieces, gun fights, graphic torture, sex, over the top characters, interesting casting and some hilarious moments.Mads Mikkelsen stars and excels in a highly entertaining action movie centering around an aging hitman in the final weeks before retirement. If he reaches retirement age he is due a pension payment of 8 million dollars and his employer is adamant that will not happen.The obvious comparison of this movie is John Wick, but Polar has a very different style and over the course of three movie theres a lot more depth to the Wick movies in terms of the world they live in. I find the best way to compare this movie is a combination of a Liam Neeson action movie (the protagonist and core story), Guy Ritchie's gansgter movies (direction and editing style) and your typical superhero movie (for the lacklustre minions and over the top super villain).The most questionable element of the movie is the casting of comedy actor Matt Lucas in the villain role. In my opinion he provides an entertaining and over the top performance to the character., which sits well with the overall movie, that being said it does feel fairly cartooney but it does work. I can imagine a different casting, would have provided a fairly drastic tonal shift of the whole film which may not have been an improvement.Ultimately Polar is a highly enjoyable movie that looks and and sounds great with action of all kinds.",Polar

Characters had no depth whatsoever, the plot was ridiculous even for the silliest of comics. Vanessa Hudgens can't cat to save her life, and Mads Mikkelsen, who is usually fantastic, was painful to watch. I can only hope he accepted to be part of this mess because he had lost a bet or something.

310,judicmr,Greatness Overcome by Stupid,6,31 January 2019,"First, I kinda liked the humor, creative cinematography, most of the acting, the action, and basic storyline. But there are a lot of parts that make no sense except to amp up the graphic nudity or violence. One example is the ""A-team"" deploying a girl to have sex with the intended hit, but she has to move out of the way so the sniper in perfect position can shoot. Another is the addict who's supposedly a drug ""expert"". The snowflake ""A-team"" characters are unbelievable and largely unnecessary. The repeated killings of all the occupants of every house gets repetitive, and could have been handled in a funnier way by just showing the first, and tallying the rest. As it was, it just desensitized the audience to the rest of the movie. The crazy/wimpy bad guy surrounded by an overly loyal army. Why do I need the ""A-team"", when I have those guys?

These movies I like to call Tarentino wannabes. The 90s started this style and it looks like it's having a renaissance ( probably because all the 90s kids have grown up and a new generation ignorant to the style is buying movie tickets) but it's been done before and better before.
I guess a lot of people who watch this type of movie are high anyways. So it will probably get like a 6 or 7 rating here, when it really doesn't deserve it.
It's vapid.
Simple enough action film with no depth and no heart or soul. Just flash. Just really trying hard to be stylish flash.
It's just not enough anymore.
Our barre for film has been raised way too high and while this would have broken some barriers in the 80s, it presents nothing new or original now. Even the plot has been done over and over and much much better. The Professional, anyone?

The basic thrust of the film is perceivable to anyone who watches action movies at all. You'll see things coming from a long way off. There are some neat twists, and some, ""Oh...? Oh, okay...!"" moments (ones where you say, ""Ah, so THAT is how we get to there!), and a lot of moments where you just smile and say ""Guh-bye!"" to someone. What I really liked, though, is how all the loops closed.Forget what the critics say. I liked this movie. Over the top? Ridiculous? Sindy's got amazing tits? Yep, that and more!

I have to admit, much to my guilt, I sat through it because thisnotwithanding because of Mads Mikkelsen: one of the greatest actors around today.
Also I was quite taken aback but in the end, despite it's excessive blood spattering and torture and over the top graphics (probably because it's from a comic) I watched it entirely.

Madsen waltzes through this film, as much as Keanu Reeves did in John Wick. Matt Lucas as Blut is pretty much an evil Elton John baddie or crazed Little Britain character.

Some of the scenes were very well shot.Wasn't sure about Matt Lucas really, but he faired well I guess.

357,c7flat13,Started ok... (Spoiler alert),3,25 January 2019,"I love mads mikkelsen. He's one of my favorite actors since valhalla rising. He is an intense understated actor and I enjoy his performances. So when I saw Johnny Knoxville in the opening scene I thought ok maybe that's clever. I followed along despite the camp hoping for a good story and some entertaining action. But at 23 minutes when the plot line is laid out I was done. First the idea that a world class Hitman as serious as mads worked for the pasty unconvincingly dangerous mr blunt was a disappointment. And second, the idea this mr blunt would decide to double cross his agents to keep from paying their retirement was just amateur. The idea a man supposedly as powerful and wealthy as a mr blunt who hires squads of the best hitmen in the world decides he's too cheap to pay on his retirement plan is just moronic. And leaves so many gaps a semi would fit through it. Do the other hitmen helping him set up mads character realize they won't get their retirement? After presumably years working for dopey Mr blunt these retiring hitmen had no clue he was dumb enough to try something like this? I mean the whole plot is tedious. And then the constant jump from dramatic shots of intense mads mikkelsen to the campy awkward scenes with the other characters is jarring and annoying. Would have been better as a drama with mads and his neighbor. Whoever read this script and decided it was worth the paper needs a new career.",Polar

361,bbr00ks,Above Avg for Netflix,5,31 January 2019,Mads is always entertaining to watch but this movies tries to hard to hip. (Spoilers) I have no idea if it's true to the Comic or not but it is over-the-top in terms of style. Think Gotham on steroids and with a hard R rating - with Mads as a grown up Batman. It's hyper violent but done in a comic style. The bad guys here are a bunch of clowns (yes almost dressed like clowns too) who blast their way across the country without regards to collateral damage in pursuit of Mads. They each have their specialty but the viewer mostly just can't wait for them to be killed. The whole crime syndicate comes off like a bunch of murderous fashion designers. The movie has some nice stylistic touches but overall the good work by an aging Mads can't elevate this above an average action flick.,Polar

Don't expect a thought provoking narrative, or multi-dimensional characters. It's just a really fun action movie. Cool fight scenes against black and white characters. The bad guys are really bad so it feels awesome when the good guy finally gets them. It has over-the-top violence, nudity, and some dark humor. It's like watching an action flick from the 80's. I really like the over saturation of the colors and the flamboyant characters. It's similar to Sin City in how they tried to keep the comic book feel in the movie.The main character is a pretty bada$$ killer and the movie makes you hate the ""bad guys"" just enough that you're rooting for the main character the whole time.It was a fun movie to watch, no need to hang on to every word or worry about missing a line.

Over the top violence, reminded me of the Paul Giamatti, Clive Owen pic Shoot 'Em Up; again, it was cartoonish. Vanessa Hudgens has some acting chops, her several monologues were real, believable.

Fine acting by all the actors and actresses plus a reasonably good twist at the end. What I applaud most is that, for once (in my not-that-vast movie-watching experience anyway) the bad guys who work for the main villain actually realise that there is no point in fighting the invincible hero and sensibly stepped aside to avoid risking their own life.

379,C.J.-4,An eclectic mishmash of characters!,7,25 January 2019,"Wow - I don't know what to make of this film - it's like nothing I've ever seen before. I'm just not sure if that's good or bad yet - let me think about it for a few weeks. It's actually one of those films you need to process.I can't fault the acting - Mads Mikkelsen delivers his characteristic and reliable screen presence, Vanessa Hudgens gives a truly remarkable performance filled with torment and emotion and Matt Lucas creates a quite unique larger-than-life very-yellow bad-guy. From the supporting actors who butcher their way through most of the remaining cast and the cameos of Johnny Knoxville and Richard Drefuss (great to see again)... the acting is near-perfect. Special mention to Katheryn Winnick as Lucas' side-kick and the only one on his team with a brain!However, the problem I have is the eclectic mix of characters doing their own thing. At one end you have Hudgens giving an extremely dramatic performance (kudos to the actress who has shown a remarkable ability for both comedy and drama). Then, at the other end, you have Matt Lucas and his merry band of killers giving a near-comedic performance. Only Mikkelsen really bridges the two as an action hero who doesn't really seem to fit either but grounds and binds everything. The film is listed as 'action-crime' but should have included 'pseudo-comedy'.Don't get me wrong. This may actually become a cult film but... one has to ask if the actors filming their scenes knew what the other actors were doing. If they had, they may have delivered their performances differently. The director Jonas Åkerlund did well with this movie - especially the action sequences - given that his career is predominantly music-based videos and documentaries.
Only you can decide about this cinematic experience for yourself. You'll either love it or hate it. I don't think there's much middle ground!",Polar
380,OzoFriendly,Bipolar,4,10 February 2019,"I love comics and i've enjoyed a lot of blood-drenched and sexually outrageous series. While I'll commend any effort to translate the better comics to film (Saga, Transmetropolitan, 100 Bullets anyone?), I think you have to be careful to restrain the urge to render every frame as vividly and as viscerally as they appear in the comic.My problem with 'Polar' is that translating the characters and story worked well enough: Mads and Vanessa did a pretty good job and the screenplay wasn't too shabby.Unfortunately, the lurid cinematography, OTT violence and discomforting, exploitative sexuality broke too far from the source material and quickly became an unpleasant distraction from the narrative.After Chan-wook Park's brilliant 'Old Boy', Hollywood evidently rediscovered its taste for ageing superdudes. From the 'Book of Eli' and the 'Expendables'.x to 'John Wick' and the 'Equalizer', there's a lot of fun to be had watching veterans kick disrespectful yoof squarely and mercilessly in the nads.Maybe Mads, who also EP'd the movie, thought he'd look as good as Denzel and Keanu with an implacable glower and bazillion scars. Unfortunately his stony gravitas, such as it is, is shot to bits by Åkerlund's misfiring attempt to follow in Matt Vaughn's somewhat softer footsteps.'Polar' is really quite a bad movie, but if you've a thirst for gratuitous violence, arbitrary execution and white girls with big boobs and a phat asses who serve no purpose other than to show you said boobs and asses, then you'll probably enjoy it quite a bit.For everyone else, I'd recommend giving it a miss.",Polar

And then you have Mads Mikkelsen and 'The Black Kaiser', say what ya want about Mads, but he gets the job done in movies, doesn't matter what his role is, he makes you believe it.Honestly when I saw the trailer I was like 'Yea this is gonna be great!' and then when it started and all the 'Smokin' Aces' type intros to the characters I was like 'Mehhh....' but thirty minutes in it really picks up, and its a wild ride after that.

Mads Mikkelsen does a great job in presenting a subdued hitman who is hunted by something he did.
Vanessa Hudgens also does a great job with her character. There is a revelation in the movie that she plays really well.
Story is good.Cons:
Supporting characters are not terrible. They feel like they exist in a different movie all together.
The dialogues are fine for the most but horrible in some scenes.
Pacing is inconsistent.
The main antagonist is a shell of a character.All in all: Its a weird movie with at least two actors doing well. Story is solid but its supporting characters are horrible. The tone of the movie is what hurts the movie the most. Watch it for Mads and Vanessa.",Polar

The 3 or 4 major show down fight scenes were gory, yet magical in the fashion of the fight scenes in the Bar and Church in The Kingsman . I was surprised about the purpose of him and the dog, a scene that could have been eliminated . I wonder why Camille was living next door to the man who killed her family and knew him , yet did not fear him. He had no clue she was his charity which is also strange but cute. The relationship between the actors was outstanding and that Sindi was a sexy assassin each of her scenes.

It had the potential, but the main Villain ruined it for me. It went from stylish to camp so quickly I got lost in what I was supposed to be watching. There were a few nice touches. Felt Hudgens' character coming through nicely at times and she really created a character with depth and purpose. MM looks every bit the part, but unfortunately, wasn't given a villain, or a group of villains, that would make his character's skill stand out - or even just make him seem believable.There are a few, ""What happened to that character?"" moments. But I haven't read the source material, so who knows what would've happened in the sequel? (I would love to MM given another chance at this character).It was all over the place, but there were a few nice touches, and VH and MM did what they could with what they were given.

413,chizzckh-67456,A two sided film which is neither one thing or another,6,4 February 2019,"I was excited when I learnt of this film.I heard comparisons to films such as John Wick plus I am a big fan of Mads Mikkelsen. Thats to name a few good reasons why I wanted to watch this film.I love my gun play action movies, I have no problem with over the top violence if done in the right way and it adds to a film. I think the film does tick these boxes.Where it fell down for me is it tries to be serious, with Mads exuding the aging assassin who has seen it all and done some terrible things. You want to know more about him as a character and the organisation he works for but you never really get to delve into that.Then you have the second side of the film with the comic book characters who are all meant to be plausible hitmen, unfortunately they just aren't. To a certain extent I kind of can live with these types of characters in the film but where it goes way above the line is Matt Lucas character - Its just too far North to hold any credibility as the main bad guy, its verging on painful.There are plenty of films that do the whacky hitman types like Smokin Aces and the 7 Psychopaths well and then you have the likes of John Wick at the other end of the scale which is brutal but remains mainly serious.This film tries to be somewhere in the middle of the above but fails to hit anywhere near the heights.Its ok, not terrible but not as good as some have lauded it in my opinion.What I do think is Mads would also make an excellent John Wick (type).Worth a watch certainly but I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed as the end credits went up.",Polar

The average rating is 6.3 as of review, while John Wick's 3 Parabellum has a 7.5Unfortunately the primary reasons being that Keanu Reeves has a large fan base that worship him, I like his movies, will always be a favorite especially the Matrix. But his John Wick movies after part 1 were lackluster, part 3 especially so. No story, just senseless killing with an immortal Wick.What about this movie? It's amazingly well made, at first when I started laughing I made fun of the movie and had low expectations but boy was I blown away. The actor picked to play the old retired assassin is very convincing, gritty and professional in his manner, the story at first looks so-so but when it picks up speed and at the very finale manages to wrench you heart and pull a few heart strings, the killing is there, lots of it, and its done in a believable smooth manner not with pencils like in John Wick.

The film is exactly what it should be: over the top comic book action played out by an eclectic mix of actors. It's brazen about it and doesn't shy away from being cruel yet comic at the same time. There's gore galore and some fairly inventive kills with a few sprees piling up the body count. Mads plays it straight and is always good value in the anti-hero role. It's like John Wick with an injection of Jackass.....it turned out this movie was pretty fun when the actions going and a good watch, you don't need to think to much just enjoy the ride.

Even some of the violence could have been used to make a real movie but the moments that COULD have been something more powerful were presented in a childish giddy comical enjoyment of death for death's sake that was constantly goofy and trying to be funny for no reason.Honestly the most enjoyable thing here was Mads and Vanessa's acting. The two of them really did a stellar job. That being said, their parts almost felt like I was watching an entirely different movie that accidentally got remixed into some mindless gorefest.

I haven't read the graphic novel but I think it's possible to visualise the illustration from the aesthetics of the film. Mads Mikkelson is excellent as the charismatic assassin and very athletic for his age!

This is not the worst movie ever made, but it adds absolutely nothing new or exciting to the genre, it's so ""meh"".The story is practically non-existent and uninsteresting; Our anti-hero is about to retire. Their contractors want him dead, so they can keep his money. That's it. There's a subplot involving Vanessa Hudgens' character, which goes nowhere. The characters are paper thin, including the protagonist, played by ht under-used Mads Mikkelsen; we know absolutely nothing about him, he has no charisma, no personality, we only know that he is good at killing and that he is some sort of John Wick-like legend. Vanessa Hudgens' performance is good but she is also given very little to work with. Tne rest of the characters are just annoying ""whacky"" and ""crazy"" evil villains.I was hoping for, at least, some good action, but the movie even fails to provide that. We do get a great amount of graphic violence and a couple of okay-ish action scenes, but i just could not care any less about what happenned to our protagonist.

Mads is definitely a great actor, the next big thing for sure and is now one of my favorites. The serious assassin role suits him superbly well, he did a great job with the ""serious dude meaning business"" act.

453,sirwulfrick,Felt like I watched 2 different films.,6,11 March 2021,"After watching Polar I felt like I'd watched two different films that had been spliced together. One film was a fantastic watch about a retired assassin who gradually develops feelings for a woman with whom he has a much deeper connection than he first realises. This half of Polar was a fantastic film! Mads Mikkelsen very ably portreys the serious, retired assassin who just wants a quiet life but whos past is catching up with him. The acting was genuinely excellent and the chemistry between Mikkelsen's assassin and the woman played by Vanessa Hudgens. Their developing relationship made for great viewing and the plot twist at the end was genuinely surprising.That half of the film is legitimately a 9/10, so good is the acting and script writing.Then there's the other half of the film - the team of assassins sent after the protagonist to kill him and therefore save his former employer a pile of money. This half of the film was a disasterous shambles. The ""team"" of assassins were entirely incompetent, totally unbelievable and the scenes in which they try to find Mikkelsen's character are filled with pointless levels of excessive blood and gore. I have no issue with violence in films, where it serves a purpose. Here it served no purpose whatsoever. In very sharp contrast to the brooding, threatening assassin played by Mikkelsen the team sent after him come across as a bunch of needlessly violent incompetent clowns.I fully understand that the director was attempting to faithfully follow the plot and themes of a graphic novel, but that does not necessarily make for a good film. Polar could have been an entirely stand-alone film all about the relationship and dynamics between the retired assassin and the woman for whom he develops a growing emotional connection. With Mads Mikkelsen and Vanessa Hudgens that would have made for an *amazing* film. The rest of the utter crap included here was utterly forgettable with the notable exception of the surprisingly impressive portreyal of the psychopathic antagonist by Matt Lucas.One half of this film I would happily watch over and over again.

This one goes straight to the so ridiculous I kind of liked it category. Surely the director and cast are taking the piss??Starring Mads Mikkelsen as an ageing assassin approaching retirement where your employer kills you to avoid paying your superannuation. Yes, that's the storyline.This movie has it all, crazy over the top villains, super inept guards, snapping bones, exploding heads, torture and long monologues. Why not just kill him? No, you have to make him suffer just long enough for him to escape and seek revenge on your ass!Excellent cast including Lagertha from Vikings, Richard Dreyfuss and the bald dude from Little Britain. Very tongue in cheek performances and it's hard to take them too seriously. Little Britain dude is playing so far from type it's hilarious.20 years ago, this would have been my favourite movie.

475,lavo-01940,Need a second chance (spoliers alert) !,10,23 May 2020,"It was very entertaining !I was sadly impressed by the bad reviews this little gem got, therefore, I stand up and insist, this film needs a second chance.As being both a Pulp reader and French, I must point out ""Polar"" means ""Roman Noir"" and the film does manage to answer my initial expectation, especially thanks to its witty dark humour, as we see a karaoke display of Earth, Wind and Fire's ""September"", just after the first kill! As well as, Rusty's accidental death was sadly hilarious (or hilariously sad, depending on how you view it), thus making clear, this was going to hold up, once I started watching.Most of the negatives reviews point out the young assassins group as annoying, but I think that was the point, thus making it more enjoyable when the protagonist takes them, one by one, as they felt very united as a team, and thus, they went down as such.However, the villainous Blut (perfectly played by Matt Lucas) was indeed very over-the-top, maybe as part of this dark-comedy aspect... but! Too bad he didn't get a more fitting over-the-top demise.Talking about the leads, both Mads Mikkelsen (as Duncan) and Katheryn Winnick (as Vivian) do an excellent job, as both of them carry the movie, whenever we see them individually or interacting together (mostly via mobile-phone), as they have excellent chemistry between, making their relationship very believable, as you understand from the get-go, they mutually respect each other, despite finding themselves on opposites sides, thus making their final confrontation, very sour (I loved how the first and last time we saw them together, were the only moments they were in front of each other, making their relationship even more dramatic).Vanessa Hudgens (as Camille) does an ok job, which is promising as the twist comes at the end; although, here comes what I consider the only weaker point of the film: if they wanted to be a true ""Polar"" (roman noir), the main character should have succumbed to his protegee's vengeance, making the perfect swift into darker territory... but instead, we got a sequel-bait hinting, almost turning Duncan and Camille, into Leon and Matilda from the ""The Professional"".Overall, the film delivered what I expected, pure enjoyment. Of course, don't try to expect deep philosophy, otherwise, you might end up missing what this film's really about!I'll go with 10/10 (even with the heavily flawed ending) as I truly believe, this film needs a second change.",Polar
476,Syncourt,"""Polar"" has no idea what it wants to be",5,28 January 2019,"Let's face it, we're all here because of Mads Mikkelsen; my score reflects the fact that Mads is the main redeeming feature of this film.I wanted to like this film, I really did. Most are claiming it contains action scenes better than John Wick with a similar storyline while featuring Mads!? Sign me up! Those dreams were quickly crushed with the opening scene and each subsequent scene was just beating a dead horse. Don't get me wrong, the action sequences are better than most, but it definitely does not reside in the same vicinity as John Wick or Daredevil.While Polar's action scenes definitely increased its overall score, its characters , atmosphere, and plot - more more specifically, the lack of - destroyed any hope of redemption. The characters ranges from serious professionalism to absurd caricatures which leaves you flabbergasted and wonder how these...things can be considered the best assassins. The atmosphere switches from serious in one to ridiculously corny in the next (all thanks to the terrible character choices made by the director). Make up your mind Jonas, choose whether you want John Wick seriousness or Adam West Batman's cartoony style, but not both!All-in-all, watchable, but barely just.",Polar

And a few great little scenes that develop the side-plots and characters well. Certainly not a 19/100, as Metacritic purport. I guess it didn't satisfy the agendas of the paid critics. (And if that's the case, it's too its merit.)It's a well-casted production, with Mads Mickelson playing the 'still-waters-run-deep' role - that we come to expect of him - without hitch. While Matt Lucas plays the villain brilliantly, in his own inimitable way, too!

488,umarsonic,"A case of style over substance although that style was no filler, all killer.",7,25 January 2019,"Polar is an interesting, heart pounding and intense movie with a great Mads Mikkelsen performance. The action in the movie was awesome to say the least and the gore wasn't just throwaway it actually added to the overall movie. However, the pacing was inconsistent as was the overall tone of the movie. The villains were treated poorly in my opinion meaning that the time used to introduce them and to show us their path leading upto their targets was wasted and the confrontation between our main characters took place a long time before the ending. Also, the movie tried to pull of a surprise at the end but it didn't work in my opinion as I saw it coming but that's not necessarily a negative. The movie was good but could've been great if it had strong villains and a bit more technicality in regards to pace, tone and direction however, the cinematography is beautiful in this movie and keeping all these aspects in mind I'll give it a 7/10 or a ""B-"".",Polar

Theyre on point in this movie, and the few(waay to few considering the ending, without spoiling) scenes they share are great. Well, great is a strong word but consider the incredibly lazy writing, the fact that they manged to find a core of truth there says alot about their acting chops.All in all it seems this lazy, poorly written, directed and edited movie tries to be two thing at once.

The plot was essentially nonsense, but that's really not why you should be watching this movie. About halfway through I started to notice the soundtrack. Like everything else about the film, it didn't quite fit, but in my opinion it was the best part of it.
Ultimately, the film has entertainment value and I enjoyed it. I wouldn't watch it a second time and will have forgotten about it a year from now.

Mads Mikkleson is excellent in this and his character would have been terrific in something realistic. A lost chance at creating a really good genre piece. Watch for a nod to Leon, The Professional.Just skip this and watch Charlie Varrick, the Killer Elite, The Outfit, Prime Cut, or any other of those older, now over-looked movies.

IT IS NOT MEANT TO. The strength of this movie is that it is exactly what it claims to be, a comic-book movie with all the silliness, gore and over the top characters that it needs. Some plot point are questionable, like the sum of money which is quite small or how Kathryn Winnicks character supports her boss even though she will retire in the future as well. Because even though I understood the whole thing as a quick fix to get the needed money, it must make her question how save her retirement plan really is. However, these points take nothing from the enjoyment of this fun movie.Judging this movie based on what it does not attempt to achieve is like reviewing Thor ragnarök based on its qualities without respecting that they attempted to make a Marvel movie more of a comic-book movie rather than a superhero movie. Because the Hela plot that is the driving force of the movie sucks and is not well made, but it success at what it attempts to do. Polar is the same, it only does it much much better.//
When it comes to grading a movie it is always difficult to present a holistic grade, especially since I might present a truly Great movie with the same score as a cheesy horror flick which objectively is less good.

It tries too hard to be edgy; he has a dog like John Wick and in trying to turn the genre on its head, he kills it himself. This, and when the henchmen for once abandon their doomed boss are the only breaths of fresh air in the film. The action scenes are all nonsensicle, taking stormtrooper aim to a whole new level and the evil villains to new realms of caricature, being repulsive, cocky, stupid and edgily evil with no real motive. It fails misserably. Breif backstory is squashed into the plot trying to make the audience care a bit more for the characters but at the end of the day we really don't. If you're looking for a fun action film to have fun with, look somewhere else, even transformers is better than this steaming pile of manure, at least the action scenes in that are a good laugh.

He plays the role of the nearly unbeatable agent incredibly well, despite the character having barely any dialogue, he is still charming to the audience. Vanessa H does a complete turn from her usual roles to play someone who's traumatised by her past. The cast is varied and one could say, random. But add the ridiculous action scenes, the amazing soundtrack and the odd cast and you have an extravagant modern movie with an odd sense of humor and a good two hours of decent entertainment.It does suffer from lasting too long and it doesn't shy away from cliches, but I had good fun watching this.

519,Buzwardo,Wickian Winter Wonderland,8,26 January 2019,"My initial thought as the film opened was ""oh great, they are trying to ride the coattails of the John Wick franchise."" I mean there was even a dog owned by the protagonist, albeit one who finds the Golden Bridge quickly and via a twist.As the movie unfolded, however, I did find myself growing more intrigued. Though I'm not sure how the director and/or editor accomplished it, the highly unlikely and stylized characters never quite pushed past my willingness to suspend disbelief until I found myself sucked into the story. Effective use of flashbacks helped this, as well as Mikkelsen's stoic and understated performance and effective fight choreography that somehow walked the fine line between gritty realism and B movie violence.There is a protracted torture scene that went on far too long for my tastes and to an extent I felt was gratuitous where advancing the plot was concerned, and too be sure our over the top primary bad bad guys, as opposed to the good bad guy Mikkelsen plays, are costumed and act in an over the top manner that is almost Batman-esque, or perhaps Dick Tracy-esque, evoking a casual sadism that also came close to exceeding my threshold for it, though I suppose the cartoon quality of much of that over the top mayhem allowed it to grate less, particularly when opposed by Mikkelsen's intensely introspective character.Bottom line I dropped a star due to the very unpleasant torture scene, but otherwise find myself surprised I enjoyed the movie so much, feeling it deserves a place alongside other brutal, comedic, action films like Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and indeed can coexist with the Wick franchise without treading too terribly on its toes.",Polar

But that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The humor added a playful feel to that violence that I couldnt get enough of. This movie was right up my ally. I look forward to a sequel and in the meantime, im sure I'll watch this film again.",Polar

We loved it, great, over the top gore and action, and Mads does a good job of portraying the retiring assasin.Will you like it?

Give it a miss. I'm not a Matt Lucas fan and casting a well known cheap comic in a dramatic roll almost never works but I still found his performance fascinating dispite this and watching charactors inevitable demise was a bit of a treat. I give it 8/10 because it isn't the best movie I have ever seen. It is far from the worst.

This is a see and forget movie, you eat some popcorn, having fun time seeing lots of blood, revenge , headshots, brainmass , blood, revenge, torture.... and so on.
It hard times, cost a lot to be the big boss, hire potential hitmans, and especially paying them pension for early retirement, and so on. Then better kill them all before they retire...
Of course there are no surprises in this movie at all. So if you like setting your brain on standby, and just want to kill some time... it's an okay movie and very enjoyable. Lots of terrible, bloody humor.
There are some pendants to the crazyness in some of Tarantino's movies, but it'll NEVER come close to any of his spectacular scenes.
The act from Mads Mikkelsen is supurb. He has a damm good face. You know for sure from the start that nothing will happen him...or, lets say almost.

OKay disqualify me because I am of a more mature age, but my hearing is great and my ENT also says so, after repeated tests, so back to the film; if I cannot hear the dialogue I cannot get into the story and then I lose interest.

Vanessa Hudgen's performance and appearance is very mediocre. She's a 30 year old actress who looks 42. She seems to channel an inner Adrien from Rocky.

596,aeternusmalum-80663,Polar Falls Flat,4,18 February 2019,"I had low expectations when starting this movie. It definitely had some flavor and style, but not even half way through the movie, you start to wonder how ridiculously stupid the big bad ""Hitman Squad"" can really be? Upon introduction, they made them seem super professional and dangerous but the next time we see them together, they're careless and sloppy. As the movie goes on, they fall apart more and more and then all of a sudden, they learned how to plan again, I guess?? And Venessa Hudgens letting this man teach school children knowing he killed her parents, why did that happen? Does the very presence of The Black Kaiser just confuse the enemies from remembering how to fire their guns at him until they're dead? I think John Wick's story and production has made me have VERY high expectations from any movie involving assassin's and hitmen with guns. The fight scenes were way too shakey and quick to process what the hell was happening and how it happened. It just doesn't do a very good job at much, the comedy was right up my alley but other than that, the movie just doesn't do anything for me.",Polar

First half is pretty much just an intro to the background and the circumstances of the setting, intertwined with bursts of some over the top violence. Second half is pretty much just one rampage with a short break for torture.
Only thing I would have really liked to see if the ""hallway fight"" taking a page out of Oldboy and filming the entire thing from the side.

606,aj-21622,Disappointed!,2,15 April 2020,"Mads Mikkelsen is a great actor but even he couldn't save this movie, this movie sucks, the story is weak, most of the cast are bad actors, nudity and sex scenes feels forced and unnecessarily long, the villains especially the main villain is one of the worst, most boring villain ever, and again the story is too weak, this movie was a waste of my time.",Polar
607,Artylo,Thrilling and Ultraviolent Neo-Noir At Its Finest,8,4 March 2020,"As a fan of Mads Mikkelsen's work, I was instantly drawn to this gritty neo-noir film, which cover depicted a drenched and snow-soaked Mads with gray hair and an eyepatch, looking suspiciously a lot like Big Boss from the Metal Gear series, which by now you should know is near and dear to my heart. Upon watching the trailer out of curiosity, I found that this was going to by one of those films over which the word ultraviolence was pasted in big bold and blood-red letters. I was instantly hooked and I anticipated the release with glee.Upon viewing it however, I can't help but wonder whether I think Jonas Akerlund's Polar is simply a lower budget attempt to emulate the success of the John Wick franchise, by melding it stylistically with the Dark Horse graphic novel Polar: Came from the Cold, or a great, straight to the point action film, that is enveloped in Tarantino-esque storytelling, gratuitous violence and beautiful cinematography. In the end, I believe it is a bit of both. The parallels that can be drawn between Polar and John Wick are clear as day, as both their plots revolve around a retired assassin being forced back into action; however, the difference is that in John Wick's universe, there was some semblance of cleanliness and professionalism to assassination, a sort of class act per se. In Polar's world, however, assassination is this act of gratuitous bloodshed, where everyone but the main character seems to believe killing the target to be secondary to killing each and every innocent bystander on the way to the target itself.Mads Mikkelsen plays Duncan Vizla, referred to as The Black Kaiser throughout the film; a renowned and ruthless assassin, who I couldn't help but see is a somewhat different manifestation of Mikkelsen's other role as Hannibal Lecter, sharing the same sensibilities of professionalism and showmanship in murder. His persona is built as this scarred, yet carefree veteran in his field, who seems to inspire awe in all of his peers. The only somewhat sane character in the film - Vivian, repeatedly warns that people ought to ""not %*$*@ with him"" (which, ironically, every second woman featured in the film seems to do or has done previously), shining a light on his dangerous nature, much like the stories about John Wick and his infamous pencil, that are constantly retold throughout that film's dialogue. And yet he is this kooky old man, who inflates balloons and hangs cardboard ""Happy Birthday!"" letters above his fireplace, chops and sorts his neighbor Camilla's firewood, has difficulty picking what brand of sweets to buy at the shop and accidentally shoots the dog after being woken from his PTSD-infested dreams, only to replace it with a goldfish, as well as going to a local school to show kids knife tricks and pictures of sun-dried bodies, and presents Camilla with a goddamn gun as a heartwarming gift. I'd go as far to say that he is lovable in a twisted and endearing way.On a side note, after he shot his dog after the first shown occurrence of said dreams, I had this expectation that as a man who always sleeps with a gun in his pocket, he'd continue to perform the same accidental ballistics after every subsequent dream. To my immediate shock, the next time he decided to doze off was in a passenger plane. I was just bracing for that inevitable moment where some innocent bystander was about to bite the bullet, but for better or worse it never happened.The overall visual presentation of the film is probably its strongest asset. I can't speak to the accuracy of the recreation of scenes from the graphic novel, but there is a distinguishable picturesque quality to every frame in the film. Even throughout the marketing material, one can see the clear comic-book-esque symmetry. The color grading is a whole topic on its own. Scenes with Duncan are show in this very high-contrast low saturated gray, while most scenes featuring the supporting cast feature this very vivid neon saturation where the colors pop and sometimes bleed into each other, showing this clear contrast between the old and grizzled Kaiser and the newer younger blood out to get him. The only thing that has any color to it in Duncan's life is perhaps those dreams he keeps having, which are bathed in saturated dark reds and a lot of glitchy, distorted visuals. Even the typography used throughout the film shared that iconic VHS displacement. The addition of gothic lettering among the brief flashes of titling is very stylistic in referencing the Germanic origins of Duncan's nickname - him being The Black Kaiser. The layers of effects however made it almost impossible to read the text in the split second it is shown on screen, which left me waiting for character's names to appear in dialogue, so that I can confirm that what I read was right. The cinematography is usually amazing, each shot being framed and lighted in a way that only a graphic novel could entail. However, the film features a lot of fish-eyed lensed drone photography which clearly differs in quality to the cinema-grade cameras used for the rest of the film, leaving it looking amateurish at some of the key points in the plot.Another aspect of the visuals, which some may find refreshing in the current politically safe age of cinema, while others can find it to be incredibly jarring and distracting, is the generous displays of gratuitous intercourse featured liberally throughout the runtime of the film. It seems that each and every character in Polar's universe has slept with each other, or is yet to do so. The difference with other graphic novel adaptation, Sin City, which by any other mean can be cited as a direct influence on this film's style, can be drawn in a sense that even in a city filled with vices, there was this tasteful approach to the taboo, often being purely implied. Polar on the other hand has no such restraint and appears to flaunt it at every opportune moment, which I found to be garish and unnecessary, as it provided nothing to the film's substance.One of the best aspects of Polar is dedmau5's amazing soundtrack. With heavy lingering synth melodies and energetic electronic beats, it creates an amazing atmosphere of tension and serenity, especially in scenes of intense drama. The tracks that stood out the most on my first viewing were ""somb"", which was used in the serene and calm opening to the film, followed by ""cabin""; with its very nostalgically charged synth, rhythmic drums and haunting baseline, introducing us to Duncan. ""chill"" features a very tense and unnerving piano tune, signaling that not all is right as a sign of what is to come. On the more action-packed side however, the heavy hitters are ""midas heel"", ""main"" and ""nosedive"", each used in some of the most visually intense bloodbaths you will ever see, pumping with adrenaline and keeping you on edge with heavy electronic beats and whining synths. And none of that youth dubstep malarkey, that one could expect - dedmau5 provides an honest to god EDM soundtrack with his staple melodic progressions and no-nonsense sound, mixed to perfection.
The last point of contention I could think of is probably the ending. In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I would describe it as initially surprising, but well hinted at throughout the film on second inspection. One could see it as an attempt to generate a sequel, though I am not familiar enough with the original graphic novel to say what that could entail.Overall, I believe that Polar is a fantastic film, that wears its inspirations on its sleeve and creates an ultraviolent romp of revenge and drama, filled with all the staples of a gritty neo-noir setting, featuring larger than life humans, able to withstand a lot of punishment, but dish out a lot as well. Even though that some aspects of its plot seem unnecessary, along with the purely visual bloating, I'd say it is worth it to sit down and watch through, but probably not with your parents, especially if you are a fan of Mads Mikkelsen or films like Kill Bill, Sin City and John Wick. I'd go as far as to say that if you enjoy video games like Hotline Miami, this can definitely be a nice intro into that type of cinema.",Polar
608,markottoh-98639,Quirky / Assassin Film,8,26 January 2019,"I really didn't expect to like this with a 6.5 critic rating.However, within a few minutes of watching, I found myself chuckling at the odd and playful style they took with the film, somewhat reminding me of a videogame.It's enjoyable and I think worth a watch and a decent action film.",Polar
609,lex_mac,John Wick coked up with an Insta filter,7,23 February 2019,"Full disclosure: I like comic book movies.Whilst they can be predictable everyone knows that's not why we are watching them... It's for the action and the showcase of over the top characters.Mads plays his lead role to a T and comes off as quite likeable for an assassin. Trying to get pets and such adds a nice touch of dark humour and a knowing nod and wink to 'John Wick'.I found this a solid watch and seemed to borrow a lot of style from Robert Rodriguez in it's over the top scenes but with a slightly more modern feel.At no point did I go ""Whoa what the hell happened there!"" but it did make me smile throughout. This is not a movie that will change the world but it's good enough that I'd watch a second one.",Polar
610,Veldusi,Nonconforming adaptation of the comic,7,27 January 2019,"Say, you would watch two videos simultaneously. The one showing Little Brittain with it's outlandish characters and the other showing the Netflix Hannibal series. Say your brain would merge these two totally different worlds together in one monkey crazy movie. That's Polar for you.And I liked it. Or didn't. I'm not sure. To be honest, I don't think I feel the need to decide. It is what it is. Quirky and out of place. But that's fine with me.In short, the movie is about Duncan Vizla, a soon to be retired hitman, who is targeted by his greedy boss so he doesn't have to pay out. Matters become complicated and messy when Duncan refuses to be killed. He also has to face the consequences of a past mistake.There wasn't anything wrong with the production values. But It was clear from the beginning that Polar wouldn't play by the rules of movie genres. That it would adapt the freestyle form of the comic book it is based upon. This was underlined by the typical visual comedy (red balloon f.i.), the use of text overlays, and the frequent quick jumps to contrasting frames. This does not mean that the movie didn't take itself seriously. It just ignored misplaced preconceptions.I think this is something most of the critics weren't prepared to acknowledge as such, which might explain the low ratings.Albeit not as stylish as comic book adaptions like Sin City, it certainly wasn't ugly in my opinion. Also, Sin City had its fair share of cheesy moments too, heck even the Tarantino films the critics love to refer to (why?), so why judge Polar differently.Neither do I share theit negative sentiments towards the display of sex, gore and overall gritty demeanor, as it was directly related to the comic. You may or may not like the comic book, but don't hold that against the movie.Nonetheless, the main weakness of the movie is that it requires the viewer to adjust to the sharp contrast between the protagonists and antagonists. On the hand you have the emotionally suppressed duo Duncan and Camille (Mads Mikkelsen, Vanessa Hudgens), and on the other hand you have the borderline frenzy of Blut (Matt Lucas) and his henchmen. At times this contrast is too strong to make sense of the story's proceedings. One would get the feeling as if both parties lived in their own universe, reluctantly or eagerly crossing over, only to be held down by the strange laws of logic on the other plane of existence. For me, all it did was adding an extra layer of comedic effect - not sure if that's what director Jonas Åkerlund envisioned.In conclusion: a genre-jumping adaptation of a brutal comic book that might or might not appeal to your expectations and taste.",Polar

Main actors did top notch work and you could really get into the whole gritty world of organised crime and hitman life. Story was interesting and with a good twist. Not something hollywood does, pretty refreshing.

The ways in which Black Kaiser deals with numerous enemies are very diverse - fans of films such as ""John Wick"" will not be disappointed.
Polar ""is not just an action movie about assassins, it is a comic book with all its conventions, practically fantasy - I recall the absolute indestructibility of the main character.
The European 'style of the picture is remarkable - although the American film is officially shot in Canada, the German company Constantin Film is involved in the production,The director and cameraman are Swedes, and a Danish actor plays the leading role.

He is badass and he gets his job done with epic finishers and moves. The plot is not so great but it's not bad for an action movie .The other actors could have been better but the action,directing and Mads performance saves the film.

I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to movies, and I always try to highlight the pros, if there are any. Yup, if there are any. This movie doesn't have a single pro. It starts as a trash-comedic movie, and the more it goes, the pretentious it becomes. Lot of useless characters, lot of unbelievable situations, in a movie that cannot decide if it wants to be serious or funny. As a result, it just becomes annoying. A wannabe John Wick movie, which fails miserably at everything it tries to accomplish. I should probably just rate this 2/10, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, maybe there is something good about this movie that I missed.

He is not only believable while doing the John Wick-style action scenes but, unlike Keanu Reeves, he can actually deliver in the drama department (it's a shame they did not chose him for the new ""The Witcher"" series since he was practically born for the character of Geralt of Rivia).
The main problem of this movie is that all the other characters , especially the main antagonist, are so far-fetched and cheesy that it looks like a cheap B-movie when they are in the scene. They are so ridiculous and Matt Lucas acting and character is so over-the-top that it completely ruins the movie. Even if they had decided to go with the stereotypical Russian mob boss antagonist, the movie would have been 1000 times better.
Imagine ""The Bourne Identity"" but with a bunch of clowns and villains from a children's movie chasing the main protagonist instead of CIA agents, and you will know exactly what this movie is.",Polar

First off,- although the plot and scenario were somewhat cheesy and seemed like it shouldn't be a movie plot,- but the movie is just a movie adaptation of a comic book,- so it isn't really possible to make everything in the movie like the comic. Also the movie isn't really supposed to make you cry or give you some deep feelings,- so don't give it a bad rating because its 'bland' its just an action movie its just supposed to make you stay on the edge of your seat.

I love to get my brain as far away from my current reality as possible and escape the pressures of life. This film does the job.I am happy I made the effort to watch the entire film. I think it was well worth my time in the end. I also think that all the haters rating this film with poor remarks simply were expecting something else. Sad... Too bad.Curious though. I thought the closing shot with Duncan Vizla and Camille on the porch of the cabin was very cool. In one shot without cutting the camera started at a close frame in a tight shot and then zoomed out to show a view of the entire forest.Can anyone tell me how that might have been done?

733,SimplySapphic,A Fast Paced Romp,8,26 January 2019,"--------(Somewhat) Short and sweet----------You cannot sit here and compare this to John Wick or similar titles, that isn't fair and isn't at all congruent when you take theme, adaption and overall tone of the films in comparison.I think the best part of this film is that it had a really good ending that I didn't see coming, and that's rare for me, and an anti hero we can root for. It isn't meant to be funny, it isn't meant to be heartwarming- this is a tale about a man struggling to find his place in a world that no longer wants him and one he doesn't feel he quite fits into it.This movie is quirky, it's a (online) comic book adaption, after all. I enjoyed the way they filmed the action sequences and you really get a feel for Mad's character worth when it comes to the field he's leaving: assassin, and why people are rightly terrified of him.There's a few places this film falls short: the villains. They're not convincing and have a very cardboard cut out and paper thin reason for vengeance...but it is easy to hate the villain when it comes to one thing most of us despise: greed. This is easily the cheesiest part, but again, they fit the comic book formula- brightly colored, 2 dimensional, and plastic.Is this an absolutely amazing film, no- but is it a fun romp (if you can endure the sexual scenes), yes. It isn't meant to be anything but a romp, to expect otherwise and you will be let down- but you can't expect to compare this movie to other films that have nothing in comparison other than guns, violence, and a dog. And how many movies have that? A lot. Give the film a chance, it's simply put: a fast paced romp. (I look forward to a sequel, if there is one.)",Polar

737,philorth-56228,Not worth the time,1,26 January 2019,"I don't give up on films and did see it to the end but wished I hadn't. Kept thinking it would get better but it just got worse. In the first few minute the scene is set with an execution of a retired assassin which is like some comedy caper. The victim dying with an erection that deflates with his last breath. Really!,
,Then for some reason, very distastefully, our newly retired asssasin, who is trying to hide from the same company's hit squad, acquires a dog off the street. Why, it served no purpose in the story line and was hardly going to end well. He means well though but shoots the poor little thing within minutes while experiencing a nightmare. It was only innocently licking his shoe for goodness sake! A John Wick take off. It was distasteful in that film as well.
Gradually assassins are introduced, god help what their mothers thought of them. Count Dracula must have been their father!
The amount of violence is ridiculous and numbs the brain after a bit.
As for the arch villain! Mr Blobby in a Yellow suit, crazy hair and a red birthmark. I can never take Matt Lucas seriously at the best of times so there was some serious casting issues here for me!
I am a big fan of Mads Mikkelson and he is the films only saving grace. His brooding menace is what kept me watching.
The story / script is lazy and the direction jumps all over the place. Am not sure f it's supposed to be a serious film or a violent comedy but know it left me wishing I could get that time back that I had wasted watching it b",Polar
738,johnlake-40999,Mad Mads,4,5 February 2019,"Yes, it's a comic book film, and for that I can excuse the gory comic book violence. The trailer lets you know what you're in for.My arguments against it are essentially moral ones, so if you're not interested, stop reading here.First, the female characters. It's become a producer's cliche to equate strong women with their propensity for cold hearted violence and indiscriminate sexuality. Such characters are often said by some guy in the movie to have balls. No one uses the phrase in Polar but the implication that strong women equals masculine women is all over this movie like flies on a cow pat.And nowhere more so than in the ridiculous sex scene between Vizla (Made Mikkelson) and Sindy (Ruby O. Fee). Their sexual gymnastics - between a man in his fifties and a girl barely out of her teens - were at once laughable and sad. I was actually relieved when their antics were put a stop to by another prolonged burst of ultraviolence.But the saddest thing is to see an actor of Mikkelson's calibre and cachet attach himself to such a project. OK, he's done violence, torture and revenge before, notably in Valhalla Rising and The Salvation. But they were films with heart. The only thing at the heart of Polar is a stiff finger saying f*** you.Mikkelson has graced film and TV classics like Casino Royale, A Royal Affair, The Hunt and Hannibal.

What a disgrace these actors and their roles are to the original A-Team, how dare these joke of screen writers compare this circus to them?The closest thing this movie achieved in the sense of humor was when the poor dog was shot and that says it all about the creativity of the people sitting and writing this utter dog excrement of a movie. Every moment while this distasteful joke of an A-Team appeared on the screen was a cringe moment for everyone watching, bad written lines, forced nudity and sexualization of situations that call for none of that makes the soul scream in horror.Evalina- ""You pay me for sex, my private life can not be bought"" Duncan- ""How much""; later on you see that this hooker of an excuse that is supposed to be the moral superiority in this movie has sold her private life and thinks nothing off what she had said earlier, but when she finds out Duncan has given her dirty money she suddenly is set back by it. Guess what, she takes the money anyway. How can you even make this up?The editing of the scenes is horrible in all aspects, the flashing lights, the neon bright city names etc. is an epileptics nightmare. Those who say that this movie is simply another kind of Kill Bill or Machete are paid shills and nothing more because those movies had good actors, good editing, great lines that makes perfect sense, now this is another of those Netflix flicks that have been released simply to make money off a good actors face (Mads Mikkelsen).I must say after all of this that Vanessa Hudgens really is improving her acting skills, going from playing a drunk hooker in Spring Breakers to a angst filled heroin junkie in Polar is really showing where her career is going.Utter garbage, nothing more, nothing less.",Polar

Then again, I like Mads Mikkelson and will follow his stuff, he is still the best the whole flic has to offer. but he is too good and too for ""I was young and needed the money"" stuff, like that movie.

809,briatore-flavio,Most viewers just don't get it,10,5 January 2020,"This is a rarely well done masterpiece of filming in almost every way. There are a very few things I'd love to see done differently, but overall it is what it is, a gem mistaken for a piece of glass.It's essentially a European film although that might escape the viewers and that leads to misplaced expectations, which results in poor review scores. But it is wonderful, truly refreshing, more artistic and with more substance than most films nowadays. The characters are pushed to the artistic maximum, but with consistence; the violence is graphic and abundant, but for the right reasons; the sex and nudity is genuine, albeit halfway muted; the twists are ingenious, but too much for the average viewer.It's an adaptation of a comic series, and a great one, but not everything is drawn to you, so the abundant fine nuances are missed by most, obviously. For example, there is a mention of a British film having subtitles and people being grateful for that. That's Polar itself making joke of the people who would misunderstand Polar.I suggest you try and understand it without the ""subtitles"", open your mind, open your eyes and not miss out on the treasure this film is.",Polar

829,darcy-hartwick,Great,10,16 June 2019,"Shocked to see so many bad reviews. I had low expectations of this and was amazed at how entertaining the film was. The violence is so over the top as to be comedic, and the sexuality is largely the same (not obvious in the first Sindy scene but not long after it becomes evident - the violence and the sex are meant to be cartoonish - laugh at it or ignore it). The black kaiser is cool but still interesting as opposed to something like one dimensional John wick. A lot of the movie doesn't make sense until it does with the revelations at the end about his neighbour. The villain is baron Harkonnen style but still so cartoonish that you're sure this man will die by the end.That's it in a nutshell, if you can't enjoy the cartoonish sex and violence splashed against the weird moments of realism and then the surprise twist I guess you might think it sucks but for me this was an absolute treat. I did not see the end twist coming at all and when it hits it really clears up a bit the ""why does this killer seem to now have a conscience?""",Polar

Its a special genre the cartoonish action scenes but it is not over the top. It is not anything like Sin City. The storyline is ok, simple but ok and the end has an exciting twist.

But there are some awesome things about this movie that take place and may warrant a second shot for a sequel. The story line is a little convoluted by just saying he's some assassin that was the best and got old. Also it doesn't really showcase any elite types of killing on his end. They get jumbled up in the story with this black chick in Detroit who's holding an arsenal for him and then she's there for two minutes and gone.

The support cast in this movie is atrocious with some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The dialogue is painful, the voice over work cheap to say the least!
Matt Lucas who is normally hilarious and can act is absolutely cringe worthy in this. His merry gang of idiotic assasins are even worst! Don't get me started on the costume design in this movie... someone needs to be fired!
The pace of this movie is slower than a 3 toed sloth and the very 90's movie tits and ass scenes are so obviously just thrown in to try and get young males to watch this movie... mind you the assasins chick has a lovely bunch of coconuts!

854,gevorkbagdasarov,Big Solid B movie. Mads is the Boss,8,26 January 2019,"The problem with reviewers, and so called critics. They give a movie 1/10. That is not fair at all.
Just alone the cinematography and and mood this movie was going for is at least 4/10.If u want an honest short review no spoilers
Continue.Picture quality and style: 9/10Colors and saturation is on point. Very good quality. it is shot with a great angels.
Sometimes it has avit too much of the closeups. And it breaks 180 ruel from time to time. But all in all very good quality. The style they are going for is Kill bill + john Wick+ man on fire + Meal gear solid.
What i mostly did not like is shaky feeling the camera creates.
If u like any of this movies u will like this one.
Story and Editing: 7/10
If u want to know what the story is about. Watch the movie or the trailer.
The Story is simple. Easy to understand. Just like John Wick. But unlike JW this one fails at creating a captivating world. It had the potential to do that, but if it did everyone will say it is a JW wannabe movie. So it is a hard spot to be in for the movie. it is only in its simplicity that the story is like JW.
By the end of the movie u feel like this movie could have gone a bit longer. U will not be bored that is for sure
Editing is ok. not that great at times. But mostly doable. It cuts to closeups alot and from time to time keeps the cut 2-3 secunds longer. Even then the editing does a good job most if the time. It even edits the cut humorously and fun way.Characters: 6/10Where Mads exels at his character. The antagonists fail big time.
Mads character is deep, he is quite. U feel his pain and like him alot.
The Antagonist is very generic. Very unlikble and lucks a motivation. The biggest con of this movie is the main villain.
However by the end of the movie u feel u have to see the end just to get pleasure how villain gets killed.
This movie has only 2 great actors unfortunately.Where JW has Smart characters all around. This movie has only 2 very smart character among the dumb supporting characters.
Sound: 10/10Sound ia fantastic. The gun shots sound amazing. Propa to the sound engineer and designers.Music: 4/10Music does the job but forgettable. as soon as the movie ends u wont remmeber how it sounds.The final verdict and Entertainment value: 8/10Even if it has alot that bugs this movie down. All in all this is a great time with friends. I was entertained from start too finish. The only big issue i have is the main villian. The rest was nitpics. This movie is abit inferior to JW but still holds his own.I also love the Metal gear inspiration and references. They are suddle but you can tell that the games had big influce on the style and feel of the movie. Overall a great movie",Polar

So. I dislike comics, dislike all films based on comics, games and so on. Because they never have any plot and idea for thinking. But this one has it! It has a nice idea. Not because of the traumated girl (I hate it, if she couldn't live with 200 thousand dollars per year and do something kind - her life is useless, it would be great if after she said ""I couldn't live"" he should treat her life and re-ask maybe now she will be able or kill her. Really it's so annoying all these cry-babies.), not because of ""human face"" of killer, but in this film are some great details, which never are in other ""serious"" films. Here are mocked cliche of such plots. The evil-woman says all road - ""pay him, don't try to kill him"" it's great, because all your stupid ""serious"" films haven't even one person with brains who can give such advice. Really. Also, he killed his dog. It's great. Because all your new films are always about dogs are more important than people. But they aren't! He is hell killer, guys. It's a logical film, this film don't make you do facepalm. All actions are thoughtful. All heroes have their own motivations. It's rare film. Maybe it's so rare, that you, butthead critics, forgot what it means. Game of thrones, Harry Potter, Avatar, Star wars, Marvel-crap - have so many damned logical fails! Polar hasn't.

For me it was a great action-dark-comic movie. I liked the ridiculous villains, ridiculous death scenes. I was expecting a serious movie like John Wick, but it wasn't, and I'm glad it wasn't. The eliment of fun and colourfulness kept the pace, for me. John wick actually felt slow at times to me when I watched it.

The violent and clever shooting/fighting scenes were very original and gory. The sadistic torture scene was not like anything else I've watched before especially with the eyeball.
But after being chased and hunted the entire movie for the sole reason of the company that he worked for was too stingy to pay him, the ending was soooo dissatisfying.
The entire movie has as much gore as the climax in most movies but when they came to making the ending here they end it with an OFF THe SCREEN BEHEADING????? Are you frikin kidding me????",Polar

Very good movie in my opinion, the violence and gore makes you cringe up in your seat. The suspense in this movie was fantastic, and the plot was really pretty good. Yes it's kind of a unrealistic action movie but that made me like it even more. If you can't handle gore this is absolutely not the movie for you.

Polar starts out feeling like a few different movies, because the shooting style changes frequently. Some seems are wacky, some are dark comedy, and others are completely original action. It took me about half the movie to settle in, but once you do, you will see some of the best actions sequences ever filmed. Real ground breaking, gritty, sexy and super smart filmmaking. I have been a fan of Mads Mikkelsen since Headhunters and he has some scenes in this that are the best of his career. I left the film wondering if director Jonas Akerlund should pic a style and stick to it or if I should recognize his style was intentional and innovative and I should get to with the program. I think I am going to get with the program.",Polar

923,ryoshade,What you see is what you get,7,30 January 2019,"Polar is entertaining and well-paced. It has some kick-ass over the top action sequences and a charismatic lead in Mads. It's not without flaws: it features awful villains, some weak acting & cringe dialogue. Nevertheless, it's a pretty good time if you like classic action movies.However, there's one thing you can be sure of: this movie is getting destroyed by critics not because of its flaws regarding the craftmanship of film, but mainly for the fact that they consider it sexist & not progressive enough; indeed, it features nudity, sex and it isn't pollitically correct nor does it want to.While John Wick is probably a superior movie in every way, you can bet money that if it featured these supposedly undesirable elements critics would bash it just like they did with Polar. Just like they'll sing the praises to The Last Jedi for the opposite reason: that movie is beyond terrible, but they agree with its perceived ""theme"". Therefore it's ""good"".This is why audience reviews are becoming more and more useful: they might be less knowledgeable, but they're more honest.",Polar

Funny and aesthetically good, I'd say.",Polar
927,blundell-54222,"Not perfect, but far better than the critical reviews..",8,25 January 2019,"Quite a poor critical reception, but having just watched it myself I can't help that many of the reviews have missed the point of this violent slice of entertainment. While for the most part what they say IS true (clunky dialogue, silly, poorly paced), they could also add slick, humourous and stylish to that list. The corridor scene - a highlight in the trailer misses the mark and would have benefitted with better choreography but was enjoyable all the same. The Female characters, empowered one minute, gratuitously undressed the next, don't make sense other than to advance the plot and pleasure the men. It did feel a lot like the graphic novel in parts though and contrary to what I've read elsewhere Mads Mikkelsen's understated, world weary portrayal is brilliant, even if Hudgens is underused (as are are most of the supporting cast). Style over substance? Maybe. But as a ultra violent comic book popcorn flick I think it works pretty well, and whether it happens or not I'd love to see the sequel it sets up in the closing scenes. I'd say watch it yourself and form your own opinion.",Polar
928,ericricchezza,Action can't compensate for the characters or their acting,5,27 January 2019,"As other reviews have stated, this is a B-movie that is supposed to focus on the action but it's hard to get behind Duncan or hate the enemies because their acting is sub-par here. Some have equated this to an older version of John Wick who is just trying to retire and collect his pension. Sure, fine, I can see that.However, the comically inane bad guys take me out of the mood. Mr. Blut and the men/women in black discussing debt payments was so funny to me because it felt so out of place even 10/15 minutes into the movie. There is also a scene where a large man gets crucified to a wall, and has two nails put in his genitals. Then, Duncan takes a drill and puts a hole in his forehead. The man BARELY screams at all! Shock and adrenaline be damned, you're going to feel some sort of pain when a drill is going into your forehead.Overall, the action sequences were good. But the budget that went into this movie feels wasted on bad character acting, odd pacing, stylistic editing that confuses the viewer tonally, and other cliches with the villains pulls us out of the moment.I would have rather have watched this movie as ""older John Wick"" with more action than dialogue. I mean, John Wick's plot in the first movie was someone killed his dog and he went scorched earth on the whole system. THAT was enjoyable, this is meh at best.",Polar

Yes, it's all you would expect it to be. Gory and violent. After all, this is what attracted you. No?
But it's very well shot, (excuse the pun!) and the lack of dialogue in some places had me chuckling, because it was the classic case of less is more. And it balanced itself nicely.
The characters are tongue in cheek but do deliver never the less. There were some great contributions from the hitman and her, which made this film and bought it down to a level which wasn't so hard to believe.

I have a very simple way to rate a movie - how many scenes I do remember from it. I've watched block busters, Oscar nominated movies and movies from famous directors without remembering single scene. Maybe critics see more than a muggle like me but I doubt it.
This movie I remember from the beginning to the very end.
Mads MIkkelsen does a great job creating the character of an assassin about to retire. I like the contrast with the young assassins and the twisted boss. You can compare it with Wick or Snake but Vizla is neither of them. He is awesome.

977,cespinozavillanueva-42639,Both brazen and subtle and definitely completely misunderstood.,10,13 October 2021,"Remember the Mechanic? He had PTSD. So does our professional contract killer . The Black Kaiser suffers from classic PTSD. He cant sleep and barely can function socially because of a particular flashback that he can't get out of his mind. I am shocked that this completely went by the wayside for the critics. The movie has outrageous parts that are meant to make us think. Who are the the reall vile people here? Observing ridiculous and outlandish scenes should provoke the viewer to ask themselves what are these scenes trying to sarcastically force us to view about society? If a killing must be done is there some professionalism minimally required? Is the A Team, the new young very messy contract killers , the best or is a retiring killer, The Black Kaiser the true professional? Sure there is lots of blood letting but wasnt it very clear the contract killer, The Black Kaiser was not going to let anyone or anything stop him from making justice happen? The fierce determination to right a wrong without flinching is what our namby pamby PC youth need to adhere to today. Even the remnents of the evil opposition, realizing the inevitable unstoppable force of the Black Kaisers determination to carry out justice bailed out , politely stepping out of the way to allow justice to be done. I hope there is a sequel because with what shameful acts my country has recently committed by abandoning Americans in Afganistan, we could use some unstoppable forces for justice. Like the spectacular movie the Unforgiven the lines between good and evil blur and the viewer may suddenly feel their perception change when we realize suprising truths. There are no spoilers here. Just remember when you see what you may believe to be gratuitous acts , ask yourself what does campy sarcasim, sex and violence mean?",Polar

I love Mads Mikkelsen so I knew I had to watch this film, but I wasn't expecting it to be this much fun! Thoroughly enjoyed it, had a good laugh at the long sex scene that twisted everyone's panties in a bunch as I had a feeling how it's gonna end. Also used to Matt's acting in British movies and television so didn't find him distracting, found his character to be a disgusting pig, perfect big boss villain to hate.

991,tonybau,"Different, but good.",8,27 January 2019,"I'd like to start off by saying that I feel as if the general hate towards this film is outrageous to me, sure it has a different style and a mediocre plot but that surely doesn't make it a bad movie. In this action thriller we get to see Mads Mikkelsen take on the role of a retired assassin, The Black Kaiser, who has younger assassins trying to kill him before he gains his retirement funds of $8,000,000.Now to me that's a pretty simple plot, nothing extraordinary but compelling enough, what really took my attention is the idea of Duncan's sort of redemption, because as much as this movie preys on the good ol' John Wick style revenge story, it's ultimately about redemption because of the aspect of his neighbor Camille, whom he's trying to save, most likely because he's killed so many innocent people (we catch glimpses of this in his nightmare scenes) because that was his job, but he's retired now and wants to make a change.Onto the action sequences, in my opinion they were spectacular in nature, a old gruff and tough badass just tearing through terrified goons, I especially loved the sequence where Duncan has turrets and takes out dozens of goobs, all I can say is if your looking for a film with good action sequences, this is it.On to my critiques, and I have a few;
for me I feel as if the movie has excessive nudity at times but this is only in the first 40 minutes I'd say so it's not a problem but the real problem comes in the various awkward scenes scattered throughout the film, now some of them are called for but the majority aren't like for example in the beginning when Duncan is getting a prostate exam, that is NOT something we have to see but that's just me. The arc for the antagonist played by Matt Lucas was not very compelling as it could have been.A few extra things I noticed and liked was the idea that Duncan was continually trying to find a hobby and kept failing, as well as his wit I found his sarcastic tones to be quite attuned to his overall character, as well as his regret.
For Camille I like how in the film you see the horror in her eyes when she sees Duncan, the person that was responsible for her familys death.Overall, I feel as if this is a better movie than people are willing to admit, it has good structure and great action sequences
In my opinion this is worth watching.",Polar
992,stehorgan,Polar,6,27 January 2019,"Polar feels like a movie trying be a Tarantino movie. Similar style of pace with slow, slow build up scenes that lack the content a Tarantino script would bring. But succeed in the action scenes with over the top enjoyable violence.

993,seebhom,Rating applies to last 56 minutes 47 seconds,8,27 January 2019,"As a previous reviewer noted, Polar appears to be shot as two different movies. The first half is very hammed up with ott costumes and American Pie humour, the first victim's erection and the obese man farting as he dies. However the worst part is Matt Lucas trying to play a super villain. I honestly thought that it was supposed to be a comedy and I'd been fooled by the trailers.My advice, scroll straight through to 56:47 and enjoy a well shot and choreographed shooter with Mads being excellent as the hardened hitman trying to survive his retirement.",Polar

1007,mbecker-25414,Gave me a headache,1,29 January 2019,"This movie was so bad I had to make an account just to give it a bad review. I don't recommend watching it. First off a majority of what the characters do makes no sense and it begins from the opening scene. Why did they wait to kill him when the sniper could've shot him right away, there was no need to have everyone else. Yes it introduces the characters but it was terribly done and forced. In fact it's this way with all of the skills. For instance why tf are they trying to choke the fat dude to death when they just blew the other people's heads off right away. There's no planning to the script. The accountant they interrogate, his files weren't even locked when they broke in, they asked the dudes name and he told them what it was filed under, they could've just stole them right off the bat. Again, forced, poorly done scenes. This movie takes itself too seriously to be one of those so bad it's good movies and the writing and acting isn't good enough for it to be a good movie. Plus the way the characters act they can't be taken seriously, are forgettable, and look incredibly stupid as well, except for the guy they're hinting down, can't even remember his name that's how bad this movie is, but whenever I see him I just see a ""discount John Wick"".",Polar

With a leading actor like Mads Mikkelsen I could be forgiven for having high expectations.Polar was an incredibly disappointing movie. With gratuitous raunchiness, low-brow humour, and incredibly long sex scenes that felt like they went on pointlessly for hours, I couldn't wait for it to be over. In fact, I walked away from it while my roommate finished it.Above all this, the scene transitions are like an insult to the eyes. This movie frequently jumps between greyed out and emotionally-driven scenes that attempt to add some life and humanity to the protagonist with Windows Movie Maker-esque slideshow transitions into scenes that are brightly lit, colorful and are full of raunchy humour and excessive violence.While the protagonist has some redeemability, the antagonists are a group of boring cliches that try too hard to be Suicide Squad.While the final 30 minutes of the movie might be incredibly predictable there are some action scenes worthy of a John Wick lookalike that made sitting through Polar slightly worth it.

If you're able to get past that, this film is a very rewarding watch. It will not bore you, and although the plot is relatively simple and straightforward it still twists enough that it captivates the viewer. Plenty of gruesome content for those who enjoy that. Hudgens character was a little shaky at times, but nothing major. I think people who are fans of Jonas Åkerlund will eat this movie like dinner, those who prefer a more structured and classical approach to storytelling and action could struggle to get into it.I will say I had not even recognized Hudgens in her role here, whether that was intentional or just a result of her lack of spotlight acting as of late I do not know. I didn't even realize it was her until.Solid 8.",Polar
