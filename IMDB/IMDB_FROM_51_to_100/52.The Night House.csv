0,nogodnomasters,There's Nothing,5,4 September 2021,"Beth (Rebecca Hall) is a high school teacher whose husband Owen (Evan Jonigkeit) recently shot himself. She has nightmares and there are signs of a haunting. She confides in friends who tell her to let things alone. Owen was a designer and builder. He was into Caedroia, the Celtic belief of making mazes to confuse evil demons. Beth discovers pictures of women on Owen's phone, all who look like Beth.This is a mystery with limit clues that is explained in the end. I liked the idea, but they best part of the film is all the action Owen did. I think it might have worked better if the film took place with his suicide at the end.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",The Night House
1,paul_haakonsen,Slow paced attempt at a supernatural thriller...,4,30 October 2021,"I was recommended to sit down and watch the 2020 thriller ""The Night House"", from writers Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowski, by one of my friends, so of course I did so. Actually, I would have gotten around to watching it regardless, as it is a horror/thriller that I hadn't already seen.And I must admit that I was entering the movie with some expectations, as he had praised the movie fairly highly. And from what he told me, it definitely sounded like ""The Night House"" was a good movie.But I have to say that director David Bruckner just didn't manage to deliver a movie that was as wholesome of a movie experience to me as it apparently was to my friend. Sure, ""The Night House"" was watchable, but the storyline just fell short of being all that interesting. And the fact that it was a rather uneventful movie really didn't help to convince me and win me over.Perhaps I am jaded from a life-long expose to horror movies, because I didn't find ""The Night House"" to be remotely scary or particularly thrilling. It was a walk through the park to sit through this movie. And since there weren't anything scary or any jump scares, then I was finding myself lulled into a slight trance, as the movie just trotted on and on.The acting performances in ""The Night House"" were adequate. Now, this was a movie with a very small cast list, so there was a bit more pressure on the shoulders for the actors and actresses to deliver good performance. And with the limitations from the script, then I will say that they did adequate jobs.I found ""The Night House"" to be somewhat disappointing, especially after my friend had sold the movie as being a solid thriller and one with a very exciting plot twist. Somehow I am left wondering if we had actually watched two different movies.My rating of ""The Night House"" lands on a generous four out of ten stars. This movie came and went without much of a lasting impression for me, and it is certainly not a movie that I will be watching for a second time. Nor is it a movie that I would recommend horror or thriller fans to rush out and sit down to watch.",The Night House
2,BandSAboutMovies,Decent ghost story,6,26 October 2021,"The Night House may not be perfect, but it takes some chances and has a nice puzzle at its heart that makes sense the further you go into the movie. It fits nearly into that sub-genre of a genre, the giallo where a woman is either gaslighting herself, being gaslit or going slowly insane (for more, see Footprints on the Moon, The Perfume of the Lady in Black, The Psychic and Lizard In a Woman's Skin).It also would work well within the seventies style of film - Let's Scare Jessica to Death is a high mark, but it shoots for it - where things happen slowly and then the end races you through the conclusion. Once the puzzle box is opened, things get wild in a hurry.I first took notice of Rebecca Hall in Christine, a movie I didn't like but loved her in it. She anchors this movie and makes it work, often through the sheer determination of her commitment to the activities around her. Sure, she's dealing with the suicide death of her husband, but she's also pushing against the ridiculousness of it all, such as students pushing for better grades and fellow teachers wanting to know details but too ashamed to ask. Some of it becomes humor to her. And yet, so much more of it is horror, as a mirror house seems to exist in the woods by her home.Her husband's phone keeps texting and calling her. Music randomly blares. Dreams are filled with his image and voice. And when she finds his phone, she finds pictures of women who are not her, but look exactly like she does.The sound design is incredible. The editing is perfect. The effects and the way they work hand-in-hand with the cinematography is what others films should aspire to. And the plotting and the maze it leads you down can be forgiven when it loses its way sometimes, because unlike the glut of Blumhouse dreck, this movie will not overly explain itself to you. And that ending, as the two houses come together and time gets played backward? Wow.The more I think about this movie, the more I like it. I'm used to being let down by endings and modern horror falling apart by the end. This one hits the landing and effortlessly brings in a very human story of grief without hammering home its point and remembering that at heart, this is a horror movie, and horror movies are supposed to scare us, not just preach at us.Director David Bruckner is going to be making the new Hellraiser and if this is any indication, that movie is going to be interesting.",The Night House
3,oscaralbert,In New York they call anything that floats a . . .,7,23 August 2021,". . . ""barge."" If you read the closing credits of THE NIGHT HOUSE carefully, you'll notice that a ""barge captain"" is listed. No such character is seen in this movie, because he's an invisible demon named ""Nothing"" who goes around strangling aging brunettes and then leaving their corpses in the cellars of cabins built illegally in New York state parks. This is pretty much the entire plot of THE NIGHT HOUSE. (In the other 49 American states, NIGHT's ""barge"" would be called a rowboat, as in ""Row-row-row your boat gently down your dream . . .

4,george.schmidt,Hall is remarkable in this excellent modern ghost story.,8,17 September 2021,"THE NIGHT HOUSE (2021) *** Rebecca Hall, Sarah Goldberg, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Evan Jonigkeit, Stacy Martin. Compelling supernatural drama about a recently widowed woman (Hall in a remarkable performance) who begins to question her sanity when she begins to make discoveries of her late husband's past as well as their home which seems to house a sinister presence. Well directed by David Bruckner with just the amount of dread and genuine jolts thanks also to a shrewd screenplay by Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowsk. The pin-pricking score by Ben Lovett & handsomely shot cinematography by Elisha Christian makes all the difference in this modern day ghost story.",The Night House
5,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Rather underwhelming.,6,7 November 2021,"'The Night House (2020)' is, frankly, just a bit uninteresting. It isn't exactly boring, per se, but it certainly isn't all that compelling, either. It's, essentially, saved by a handful of effective and somewhat distinct sequences, alongside a confident central performance and some solid cinematography. The mystery at the movie's core is occasionally intriguing, but its answers - and some of the steps taken to reveal them - are generally disappointing. The ending, in particular, is rather anticlimactic. To be honest, it doesn't really finish anything off, even though it does reveal most of the narrative's secrets. This doesn't feel as though it was done on purpose; it's almost the opposite of something like the thematically resonant cliffhanger that finishes off 'Halloween (1978)', for example. There are some inventive visuals and some intriguing ideas, don't get me wrong. It's intermittently entertaining. Ultimately, though, it's just a bit underwhelming. There isn't really a proper theme and none of it is actually scary. It's a decent effort, but not much more. 6/10.",The Night House
6,A_Different_Drummer,creepy and well done,7,15 October 2021,"First there is Hall who, until now, has been punching below her weight class and finally gets to show she can carry a film. A tight script, nicely directed. And some genuinely scary scenes.",The Night House
7,ops-52535,if youre in a state of....,8,5 October 2021,"Grief, or any other stages off mental imbalance , then take a big breath and consider if youre strong enough at all to devour the frights of loss that unfold in this psychologicalsy drama called the night house. Its a dark , sad and strong story about being victimized due to suicide.The acting done by rebecca hall is pretty significant, and reading through my register of actresses that ive n in my mind , i cant find anyone that can replace her on the deeds of acting the wway she does. Do also consider that ms hall aint one of my favs, and that should be an insignia of quality if you ask me...its a story about grief after a suicide of close realations, a husband, that had no signs whatsoever to do so., the plot shows us the estranged wife searching for clue and symptoms on why. Its told in a vast amount of flashbacks, and utterly vivid nightmares that becomes so realistic at moments, and so scary to encounter, that my life as a fly on the wall got the eyes wide shut, prefering to watcth the corner of the screen jusst to avoid the scary moments that are to unfold.The dream sequences and the knots and tackles to make the strings of thread into a solid rope of a story are just ammazing, the score helps a lot, and the play of light , shadow andd reflection is superb. Its like a near death experience in your dreams, and deep long wandering in paralell universes and shadowlands that may exciste or not. A parapsychologist couldve made a 6 hour documentary just analysing the para-lelles that occuurs in this thrillerdrama.Aamazing it is, and many thoughts struck my ever so cronical depressive state of mind whiile viewing like the subject of afterlife, ghosts, parallel universe and mirror worlds. Therefore i recommend this flick pointing back to the start of this review, it might be heavy for some. The grumpy old man though might take a float in the boat without any oars whatsoever.",The Night House

Rebecca Hall's character deals with the aftermath of her husband's suicide and is haunted with mysteries throughout. David Bruckner directed a crafty well done version of what tremendous loss is like. I absolutely loved the presence of unknown entity whenever it happens especially the epilogue is so good!

9,Thanos_Alfie,Amazing Rebecca Hall...,6,10 October 2021,"""The Night House"" is a mystery Mystery - Horror movie in which we watch a widow trying to continue her life after the loss of his husband. Soon she starts finding out some disturbing secrets about her husband that will change her world for ever.I liked this movie because it had a very interesting plot and it combined very well mystery with horror. The interpretation of Rebecca Hall who played as Beth was simply outstanding and she made the difference. The direction which was made by David Bruckner was also very good and he presented very well his main character, her feelings and what she has been through. Finally, I have to say that ""The Night House"" is a nice, interesting horror movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will be amazed both by the interpretation of Rebecca Hall and by the interesting and mysterious plot.",The Night House
10,Tweetienator,Enter the Night,7,9 October 2021,"Rebecca Hall is a fine actress and many times she gets roles in movies with a special twist and atmosphere: The Prestige, The Awakening, The Gift, Dorian Gray, Transcendence to name a few. The Night House lines in well in her oeuvre: a mix of mystery, thriller and a slight piece of occult horror. Remarkable, besides Rebecca's performance, are the sometimes beautiful shots that compose the scenes. Last words: the told story is suspenseful enough to keep one's interest, the production fine, the cast rock solid - recommended if you enjoy movies like The Awakening, The Hole in the Ground, The Attic, Mama, Vivarium and so on, just don't expect any action or gore.",The Night House
11,Fella_shibby,108 mins of boredom to reveal 'nothing'.,3,17 October 2021,"U dont come to watch a horror or a thriller movie for the lead actor's performance.The movie basically starts off like What lies Beneath but with a lousy climax, it is also lifted from various other psychological movies where they take solid amount of time, show the lead actress at peril throughout while nothing happens to her and then they end with a so called happy ending.There is a scene where the lead actress discovers lots of dead bodies but rather than calling 911 or trying to flee, the lead actress calls her best friend n later head for the shower.",The Night House
12,jtindahouse,Hall is great in a complex and layered horror film that can still scare,8,10 September 2021,"After an extremely poorly timed lock-down in my country days before 'The Night House' - one of my most anticipated films of the year - was due to come out, I finally got the chance to see it yesterday. Getting overly excited for an upcoming film is rarely a good omen. I find that films like 'Midsommar', where the reality actually lives up to the hype, are rare. 'The Night House' was still an excellent film, but it wasn't quite the masterpiece I had been hoping for.Rebecca Hall is very good in this film. She has a very complex and demanding role and she nails almost every scene. She is basically asked to carry the entire film on her own too. None of the other roles are overly significant and are more just there to guide her journey along.There are some decent scares in this film including one that got my heart racing. The film isn't a conventional horror in any sense. It isn't looking to make you jump every chance it gets. But when it does have one of those scenes it does it very well.It plays into the story somewhat, but there are some misleading dream sequences that I thought were a little cheap and a film this classy didn't need them. It's a small bugbear though. I had a very good time with 'The Night House' and even if it wasn't quite as good as I'd hoped I'd still highly recommend it.",The Night House
13,stevendbeard,"Good, Bad & Confusing",5,22 August 2021,"I saw ""The Night House"", starring Rebecca Hall-Godzilla vs. Kong, Iron Man 3; Sarah Goldberg-Barry_tv, The Dark Knight Rises; Evan Jonigkeit-Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, X_Men:Days of Future Past and Vondie Curtis_Hall-Daredevil_tv, Broken Arrow.This is a good and a bad one. It's good because of the actors-Rebecca, in particular-but bad because of the story. It's just a tad on the confusing side. Rebecca & Evan are a married couple that, from all appearances, seem to be a happy couple of 14 years that live in a secluded lake front property that Evan built. One night, Evan takes their row boat out on the lake and commits suicide. As Rebecca tries to find out what went wrong, she discovers that Evan had secrets. Rebecca also starts hearing noises and seeing a mysterious shadowy figure-Evan, maybe?-haunting their house. Sometimes, she will see a figure and then wake up-was it all a dream? She also discovers blue prints to a reverse house-their house, but everything is backwards-and even finds the house across the lake and it contains a strange looking voodoo doll. It doesn't help when she confides in her best friend Sarah, who thinks she is just distraught over everything or her neighbor Vondie, who might know more than he is letting on to. Then, there are some pictures of other women that Rebecca finds on Evan's phone-I guess he didn't realize that women will look at men's phones-and they all the girls look suspiciously like her. Like I said, it just gets a little confusing.It's rated ""R"" for violence, disturbing images, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you really want to see it, I guess it would be alright, as a rental.",The Night House
14,robfollower,Rebecca Hall Mesmerizes In A Chilling Horror Outing,9,2 September 2021,"I found out about this film through its movie poster mini-billboard that was on display in the movie house I frequent . I took a photo of it many months before the film was released . The aesthetics of the art work immediately drew me to anticipate this art-house horror. I was not disappointing !Rebecca Hall is tremendous in David Bruckner's tense, twisty cerebral , thought-provoking psychological horror thriller. In The Night House, her impassioned dedication to her craft is on full display. The script affords Rebecca a rich and resonant role, and Hall takes full advantage of this opportunity, delivering what very well may be one of the most memorable female performances in recent horror history. Yes she is that good. I will be seeking out every role she has done.The film follows Beth (Hall), a teacher who was recently widowed after her husband Owen (Evan Jonigkeit) died by suicide. Although sudden solitude can bring about nightmares and uneasiness in its own right, Beth, who suffered with her own crippling depression when her husband was still alive, is convinced that her terrifying dreams and the strange sounds that she hears during her waking hours are not simply due to imagination. As she sifts through her deceased loved one's possessions and discovers clues about his possible secret life, she realizes that there is something more than grief waiting for her in the optical illusions that lie around every corner of the home.The new horror movie The Night House is an unsettling blend of ghost story and psychological terror - the kind of film that leaves audiences wondering what the ending really means. While some jumps are featured here and there ,and are usually effective in their own right ; most of The Night House is designed to unsettle and disturb. The cinematography lends it self to the brooding and malevolent atmosphere splendidly .At the helm by future (Hellraiser) reboot director David Bruckner, is definitely much more in line with a horror movie taking a more cerebral approach, building its scares up slowly, and going for creeping out the viewer over startling them. I think Bruckner is a promising up and comer.The filmmaker puts a formidable visual game of mirrors into practice, which fits beautifully with the story's unsettling conclusion. Enhanced by Rebecca Hall's gripping central performance, The Night House offers atmospheric horror that engages intellectually as well as emotionally. First class horror cinema . 8.5 /10.",The Night House

17,drownnnsoda,Existential drama meets supernatural horror,7,10 October 2021,"""The Night House"" follows a widowed teacher (Rebecca Hall) whose husband has recently committed suicide. Alone in the home he built for them, she soon becomes convinced that his ghost is haunting her, and perhaps something else.This effort from David Bruckner is stylish and fairly compelling, even where it treads waters that have been played out many times in the genre (grieving spouse, possibly haunted by their deceased loved one--not exactly a new concept). Other elements here recall 2004's ""Gothika"" and 2001's ""What Lies Beneath,"" both films to which ""The Night House"" owes much credit. Despite the familiar set-up here, ""The Night House"" is very effective for the most part, replete with quiet scares and a few jolt-out-of-your-seat moments.The first hour or so of the film is very compelling, and a large part of why likely has more to do with Rebecca Hall's performance than it does with the writing. The film moves forward at an even-keel pace, but unfortunately the payoff does not quite fully work--the very nature of what is happening is rendered in such a way that it at times feels obfuscated, toeing the line between an existentialist meditation and a demonic possession film--and somehow remaining committed to both.All in all, this is an entertaining crossbreed of drama and horror, but by the end, the waters feel too familiar and the payoff not quite worth it. Hall's performance holds it together, and the film is highly watchable nonetheless. A worthy genre effort, but not a groundbreaking one (and perhaps it need not be). 7/10.",The Night House
18,Pairic,And He Built A Crooked House,8,24 August 2021,"The Night House: A Haunted House Tale which strays into Folk Horror territory at times. Beth (Rebecca Hall) has lost her husband Owen, he suddenly committed suicide, no warning signs. Now strange events occur in the lakefront house that Owen built in Upstate New York. Noises, knocking, music centre turning itself on, nightmares. She also learns that Owen was keeping secrets from her. There is a hidden unfinished house in the woods, the plans for their house contain strange notations and occult references. Beth's attempts to solve these mysteries sets her on a path to a confrontation with dark forces. The woods by day and night present a brooding presence in this film, they almost seem to be capable of pushing people into the lake; so it's no surprise when Beth has a vision/dream of running women leaping into the water. Only a coupe of jump shocks as most of the horror here is psychological but the attacks by an invisible entity adds to the fear/tension, as do the grim discoveries made by Beth.

20,masonfisk,GOOD ATMOSPHERE...NOT MUCH ELSE...!,5,1 September 2021,"A current haunted house flick in release starring Rebecca Hall. Hall is in mourning having lost her husband due to his self-inflicted gun involved suicide. Coming from seemingly nowhere, Hall, a teacher, now has to piece her life back together (staying civil w/her fellow co-workers, deciding to whether or not sell the house her hubby built from scratch) as things start to happen in the home (the stereo turns on & noises which sound like footsteps plague her at night & she even receives a phone call from her husband, etc.). As she can do nothing but investigate the circumstances we find out from her neighbor, played by Vondie Curtis-Hall (no relation!), her hubby was stepping out on her, strangely w/women who resembled her,& that he was constructing a sister house across the lake from their own which when she finally goes over to see for herself, a grisly discovery is made. As the last third of the film plays out, where usually a film starts giving us the whys & hows, the film starts serving answers which don't add up; is it a ghost, an inverted world similar to our own, possession? None of the conclusions are satisfying & we're left w/a pain about the temples where we rubbed our fingers across during the movie's runtime.

22,rgkarim,A Leading Lady Brings Lots of Thought And Appreciation For A Realistic Thriller,8,20 August 2021,"LIKES:Great Acting:
The movie focuses a lot on a character centric plot and challenging the psyche of our main character Beth. For such a heavy focus on characters, that means a good acting set of skills required and I think the cast did and exquisite job of bringing their characters to life. Vondie Curtis-Hall does well in his role as the concerned neighbor, nothing too over the top or a masterpiece, but certainly a good chemistry for the time he is on screen. Goldberg as the best friend has her elements as well, and I liked the more serious conversations of that friend trying to snap the main character out of her potential psychosis to get her back on track. It's really Rebecca Hall though who gets the most shout outs given she is practically a one woman show. Hall has to do a lot of acting and reacting with herself, and I'm impressed in the levels of human emotion she pulls out in her time on screen. Drunk stupors and rage over the guilt of her loss, has that balance between forlorn and animalistic carnage that felt very realistic. Her ability to get lost in the fog of depression and piecing the clues together to try and overcome the said grief that plagues her. And of course the pure terror she gets in the potential of being haunted was a smashing success for this reviewer. Hall's acting is the keystone to much of the mood of the movie and I was very happy to have a strong lead play the central roleCreepy Atmosphere:
What worked for the horror element of this movie is just how realistic the haunting feels compared to so many of the other films in the genre. Beth's journey is not in some desolate town, a dank cave, or abandoned warehouse that she stupidly tried to conquer. No, the film is in her home, and that element of safety is quickly compromised as we watch the paranormal activity subtly climb in and challenge her comfort in this very dark time. The slight noise changes, the hint of something in the dark, and those familiar signs are brilliantly carved out to push your creep factor up, perhaps to the point of wanting to sleep with a light on when you get home. The realistic approach certainly keeps that element going and you just wonder what the next blanket will be ripped away during the course of the film.The Presentation:
What also helps add to that element of horror is the presentation this movie leans heavily on. If you read the premise, you'll see that The Night House is all about challenging the psyche of our leading lady, as every time the horror elements happen she wakes up and wonders if it is a dream. Psychological thrillers can do this element brilliantly under the right direction and I think Bruckner succeeds in keeping you guessing if it's real or not. Rather than doing it to the level to mess with your mind and distract you from the other story elements, they keep the challenge under control allowing you to still dive into the other elements of the story and the mystery beneath it. Speaking of which....The Mystery/Layering Elements:
The Night House has an interesting mystery that is ever evolving, always baiting you further to uncover the truth between the opening events of the movie. Every act of the movie gives you a little more insight into the mystery, but wrapping it up in the psych component mentioned above. As the truth starts to come to light, the feeling of the movie continues to change as you determine what is really plaguing Beth's life and is it real. The film gets a nod to the curvy story it's telling, with leads helping guide one way and then changing to be a twist that feels very much like a decent drama book. I liked the tale's teases that were never too diverting or out of whack to screw up the pacing and focus of the tale, so well done there.Meaning/Deeper level:
That artistic feeling is indeed still baked into the movie, but not to the point of consuming the entire film and getting rid of the elements that make horrors entertaining. Beth's journey may indeed one part happening in the real world, but it's also a nice dive into how people face the darker fathoms of life. The doubt, the searching, focusing on what is next while battling the past and what is missing is a deeper dive into human pieces that again works into the subconsciousness of the story without getting in the way. So well done.DISLIKES:Somewhat Predictable: Though there are ""twists"" thrown in, the tale is rather a straightforward shot that you can flesh out rather quickly. Horror elements struggle in the unique aspect given the volume and time the genre has existed, so don't expect the levels of mind blown that Hereditary did.The Pace is Slow and A Bit Boring:
I think the category speaks for itself, but this is a movie that does not necessarily move in a style that will keep most people awake at night. Fans of the horror movie where there is a victim every 10 minutes are not going to enjoy this film, nor will the audience looking for jump scares or a monster appearing frequently like something from the Syfy channel. The Night House has a pacing that again feels much like a book, working to build the moment and character up, while setting the scenes up for a truly challenging experience. And though it accomplishes this well, I think a few more elements of the other horror movies could have been included to keep the pace up and give us some excitement instead of just slogging through like we had. Not the worst pace by far, but just something to tweak in the future.Uncomfortable, but Not Truly Scary:
The movie is not the scariest piece to come to the Big Screen, and did not leave my mind reeling in fright/shock at what came. Fans of this film are again going to be subjected to more story than scares and I can't say this movie's ending really had me on the edge of my seat. When the truth finally reveals itself, you'll appreciate the characters more than the scary element, which was a bit underwhelming given all the potential it had. Though the atmosphere is creepy and kept in theme with the movie, I do have to say I would have liked a little more pizazz in the final revelation and the divisive ending it may bring to the audience.The VERDICT:
The Night House succeeds in many levels as being an alternative approach to the horror movie genre. A fantastic central lead is the true backbone of the movie and Hall's performance and nearly one woman act gets a high round of applause from this reviewer. The tale itself is stacked in more details and layered with elements that together form an engaging mystery, a bit of a thriller/drama, with some horror undertones, something I very much enjoyed in my time with this film. Take in the creepy atmosphere alongside the presentation of real vs. Not real and you again get a combination that only further elevates the movie. However, there are still some edges to have shaved, primarily the fact the movie's scare factor is not that impressive and the pacing feels a bit slower given the potential they tried to build up. As the truth is revealed, it takes a bit more of the psychological side that fits with the tale, but does not leave your mind blown or scarred in the process. Sure , you might sleep a little better at night, but that wow factor was missing for me in the long run, especially with the potentially ambiguous ending. Still the film gets some nods for quality and points for not taking too long to tell this deeper tale. My scores are:Horror/Thriller: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.0.",The Night House
23,vengeance20,"Good, But...!",5,20 August 2021,"I've never heard of this film, nor have I seen trailers for it, but I went to see this due to it being a horror. Obviously.The film follows a woman who recently having lost her husband is bereaved & trying to get over her loss. However, supernatural occurrences & said clues start to unravel a dark & surprising revelation to her husbands said suicide.I found the film to be good, but slow in pacing & story telling which was at most... annoying! At 1 hour & 41 minutes, it's way too long for such a simple revelation which could've been said sooner & of course got to the damn point!! Moreover, the ending still leaves us with more questions than answers, like for example, what was this spirit that attached itself to this woman's husband & why did it want her dead!? Like why & what!? The film drags on & on only giving little hints here & there & that's the thanks we get!?The jump/scares, visuals & sinister undertones were good, but the pacing & runtime, never mind the slow story telling & dumbarse ending with more questions than answers is what let's the film down!Overall, it's alright, but honestly, it's not that great...!5/10.",The Night House

25,arungeorge13,"If you enjoy ""atmosphere"" in horror movies, then this one's for you! [+68%]",7,9 October 2021,"I will mostly remember The Night House for Rebecca Hall's excellent performance as a widow trying to unfurl her dead husband's secrets. Not only does she successfully drive the film to its twisted supernatural finale, but she also makes us root for her. The details are revealed in a slow-burn fashion with just the right amount of jump-scares. The Night House is also a film that looks visually rich and boasts a solid soundscape. The final act borders on the frenetic and is a bit rushed compared to the rest of the film, but it still feels like a major storm has rushed past.It wouldn't be wrong to remark that David Bruckner pays more attention to evoking tension than fixing it. Multiple questions pop up towards the end, and they're mostly answered in a hurried but convincing way. As the film revolves around an inexplicable suicide, it tries to bait the viewer with various tangents at different junctures cleverly - some clichés are neatly subverted. Bruckner creates an atmosphere that's equal parts creepy and mysterious, using close-up shots of Hall to scintillating effect. The way he characterizes and captures Death is impressive. The Night House is one of the more engaging atmospheric horror flicks of the year, no doubt!",The Night House

The movie will also make
You jump which it did for me as it was quite the experience in the theater.Rebecca Hall's performance in the movie is strong that shows how underrated she is as a actress she delivers a strong performance in the movie that you get really interested as the story goes on.The music works out very good as well as you can fwel the vibes of the movie. The setting is very scary and that you never know what comes next.Night House has become one of my favorite movies and one I am glad I saw in theaters.You will not be disappointed.

I like the second half because it becomes very bleak in such a poetic way and it somehow reminded me of Blackcoat's Daughter.Her friend got in the water to rescue her from the boat and they got on the dock and I was like ok this is good anyway and she said ""you're safe now"" and then I got she just did it. Back when she was a teenager, she had a car accident and died and when she passed away, she brought something back with her which later on possessed her husband somehow and it wanted Beth back and asked her husband to send her away. He sacrificed many women in his makeshift cabin the the forest (Beth discovered the bodies under the floorboard) and with the help of an eerie statue (a Babylonian myth?) he tried to get rid of that (nothingness?) but it didn't work and he shot himself in the head on the boat to make her safe but it didn't go away and took her on the boat, as well.There is this moment when she has one of those dreams and she opened her front door just as she woke up on the couch by the door and that moment somehow gave me the creeps. Later on that duality in the film kept being used with the double moon ( red moon with the nothingness and the white moon), when her friend is shouting at her when she's on the boat on the red side with a gun in her hands and I really liked this concept.",The Night House

32,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Supernatural horror film,6,9 October 2021,"Supernatural horror film with psychological and paranormal elements to it. It's a feminist horror film that asks ""How well do you know your husband?"" This film digs deep into a woman's instinctual intuition. Do you really know him girl? Uh huh? (Fingersnap) 😂Beth, the main character in the story is a widow and a school teacher mourning her late hubby, Owen, who committed suicide. I am not giving out anything that hasn't already been provided in the film's description.After experiencing some paranormal phenomena inside the big empty home her hubby built, she begins looking into her late husbands personal belongings and begins to question whether she really knew him as well as she thought. Did he have a second life she didn't know about?The three other men in the film talk down to Beth in a condescending manner. Gary at the restaurant with his arrogant questions. The malevolent entity that haunts the home is male grim reaper . Then Mel, the elderly black man. Mel ""minds"" that Beth crossed over to the other side of the lake on public owned county land. He questions her sanity and offers to make her a sammwich. Educated Beth is like pthhh, no thank you Mel; i can make my own.She uncovers horrid things about her late hubby. In the end, it is the other female that comes to her rescue and snaps Beth out of the same fate as Owen. Very little story time is devoted to the hubby she mourns.The film isn't terrible. I think it deserves a 6/10 because it does have tension and atmosphere. It just doesn't have a good story. It uses ambiguous CGI that blend human forms with architectural elements like. If you are familiar with Rubin Vase, its the type of art you see two different things depending on your perspective .I think females will like this sappy horror film much more than males would (betas excluded) because it pulls at the heart strings and challenges them to know whether they really know their partners.It's just a forgettable film.",The Night House
33,bob-the-movie-man,This one really creeped me out.,8,23 August 2021,"Positives:
Of the different movie genres, comedy and horror are probably the ones that polarise opinion the most. One person's meat is another's fowl. But I have to say that this movie officially creeped me out. I was extremely tense for just about the whole 107 minute running time. Much of this is down to Rebecca Hall, who is just SUPERB in this. She brilliantly portrays a woman on the edge, her impassive character breaking every so often into an ""everything's fine"" sarcastic smile. I know that the Academy tend not to nominate actors for Oscars for 'frivolous' films, but this genuinely, to me, felt like an Oscar-nomination-worthy performance.I've talked before in my blog about the overuse of 'jump scares' in horror films and the law of diminishing returns. This film doles them out very sparingly indeed. There are two notable ones (one spoiled by the trailer!) but - man - the first of these had me levitating off the seat!The script is very vague indeed about where you end up in this movie. (I've tried to do a synopsis of what I *think* happened in a ""Sp0iler section"" in my blog). The script deliciously muddies the waters between dreams and reality; sanity and madness; sobriety and drunkenness; with the real-life Madelyn (Stacy Martin) bringing you up short at times with an ""oh - so that bit must by reality then""!Negatives:
The ending. I'm not sure how I wanted it to end. But it felt wholly anti-climactic.Summary Thoughts on ""The Night House"": London-born Rebecca Hall seems to have a ""leisurely"" output as an actress, but she really deserves more prominence in the industry. (If you've not seen it yet, watch her outstanding performance in ""Christine"" as another proof point). Here she magnificently holds the movie together.Effective horror films for me are those on the tense psychological side rather than the mindless slasher variety. This point was well made by Tom Shone in his review in ""The Sunday Times"", describing it as a ""middle-aged kind of horror movie!"". ""The Night House"" delivered those mental chills for me in spades. There is actually very little gore in this one. But it certainly had me thinking about it when I woke up in the middle of the night last night. Was that a noise downstairs??If you like your scary films, then this one is highly recommended.(For my full graphical review, please check out onemannsmovies on the web, Facebook and Tiktok.

34,kuarinofu,Surpassed my expectations,8,10 October 2021,"The Night House is a solid psychological thriller with some occult horror elements.It has a lot of things going on but surprisingly enough almost every element of it is well-executed. The writing, the action, the direction overall, really shows that the film had a lot of care put into it. Even pacing-wise in the end it felt like so many things have happened, but it was only around 90-minute long.I'll keep it brief - I was pleasantly surprised and I can surely recommend this film. I really wanted to give it a 9, but 8 will do, for now, I'll revisit it later to check how well it holds up.",The Night House
35,Movi3DO,Babadook vibe,7,22 August 2021,"Now we are off to a horror. After her husband shot himself, Beth tried to grief while a demonic entity harassed her in her house.This movie was dark, literally. I would say more than half of the runtime took place in pitch dark and I could barely see anything on the screen. This worked most of the time, but still there were scenes that were impossible to see.The pacing was incredibly slow. I would be lying if I said that I was awake the whole time. However, this slow pace did work in creating a creepy and atmospheric horror. It's shocking but the jump scares here were actually effective and came outta no where. Also, the great acting from Rebecca Hall definitely elevated the horror and carried the movie. She was extremely sarcastic at times, rightfully so, but then delivered very well during the horror scenes.The theme of the movie reminds me of The Babadook, which dealt with grief and depression. Both movies used similar metaphors for griefs. Although I still preferred the Babadook's smart and scary usage of the entity, this movie created more mystery and had a great lingering final shot.Overall, despite some issues, it's still a good drama that used horror elements in a smart way. 7.5/10.",The Night House

The audience leaves confused about what happened, why it happened, or even how it happened. ""Nothing"" suspended Beth in the position like the statue she found? But he couldn't kill her??

The cinematography is gloomy and together with the art direction they achieve a great haunting atmosphere. The music score is low-key but gloomy.

38,johannes2000-1,"Effective ghost story, especially the first half.",7,21 September 2021,"For the first hour of the movie I was very much intrigued by this slowly but effectively unfolding story, getting more and more bewildered, just like main character Beth, by the weird and scary goings-on. The photography is great, and beside a nice sinister atmosphere, there are multiple jump-scares to keep you on the edge of your chair. Rebecca Hall carries the whole movie admirably, she's totally convincing, first as the grieved and forlorn widow of a husband that out of the blue committed suicide, subsequently as the exasperated woman who thinks she's losing her mind. She's not trying to win our sympathy with her aggrieved and angry behavior and her heavy drinking, but you do team up with her when her world turns upside down on her.Unfortunately in the last half hour, when you expect that all loose ends finally will come together, the story went totally overboard, every other new thing that Beth finds out about her husband only made the narrative get more and more incomprehensible, and at last the weirdness and confusion escalated into a conclusion that was really too mind-boggling, at least for my simple brain.But maybe expecting some logic in a supernatural ghost story is a bit naive anyway.",The Night House

With a promise (according to the trailer) of having two opposite houses and doppelgangers galore none of it fully materializes which was a monster disappointment to me.Rebecca Hall plays a schoolteacher who has recently lost her husband to a tragic moment. Then the more she dives into her husband's history the more he discovers his darker nature.Part crime drama and part haunted house this movie is quite baffling. For instance she claims to have died for 4 minutes in an auto accident years before. And all she experienced was a void. Instead the embodiment of death takes over her husband to become a serial killer? Sounds about right. Well...I really believe there was a better version of this story. And so many missed moments of creepiness could've transpired by identical houses but having a bizarre version. Oh well. Ms. Hall is great as always. And great to see Vondie Curtis in a film again.What is this movie really saying? Most will walk away wondering.",The Night House

43,sweidman-28016,Rewarding in Filmmaking and Acting,8,30 August 2021,"""You were right. There is nothing. Nothing is after you. You're safe now.""Reeling from the unexpected death of her husband, a woman is left alone in the lakeside home he built for her. She tries as best she can to keep it together, but disturbing visions of a presence in the house beckons her with a ghostly allure. Soon after, she begins digging into her husband's belongings, yearning for answers and deciphering a mystery she's determined to unravel. The Night House may seem like something superficial on the outside, but what entails is a detailed story of grief and searching for answers. Director David Bruckner has given us scares in the movie The Ritual and segments from V/H/S and Southbound. From the strait, there was no question of whether or not the direction would land. Even from the trailer, there's a good showcase of atmosphere. That's one thing I just loved about the movie. Constantly, it feels like something could snap in the dream-like feel of it all. Rebecca Hall's Beth grieves from the loss of her husband in an unusual way where we're not just figuring out the story, but also her. Hall is absolutely wonderful and it's one of her best performance, if not the best, to date. All around the acting is good, and it's one of those horror movies where you need good acting to tell the story.The story has a little trouble with its flow every once in a while. The length could've been trimmed and have ideas left out to help with the experience. Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowski wrote a compelling mystery-thriller with Super Dark Times before this, and it might be one of the most overlooked indies within the past few years. Now that they've had time, they've gone to something bigger and essentially deeper. It's trying to tackle the case of grief along with building a compelling mystery. I almost feel like grief is handled better. So many questions are left unanswered until the end, and even at the end some aren't answered at all. Those who are taking the movie quite literally won't find solace by the end, but once the metaphor and symbolism clicks, it's pretty interesting what they did there. One of the key aspects is that of the house. It's basically it's own character and sets the mood of the location. You never know what might be around the corner or what isn't. There are some really cool visual choices they could do with it. Even the sound design is great as well. Many of the scenes are quiet and have characters talking or taking everything in, and some scares are enhanced by the changing of sounds. There are only a few jump scares, one I think was handled really well, but once again, it's mostly based on atmosphere. Mainly, I'm impressed with The Night House. It will for sure divide audiences and many will leave unsatisfied, I think. But with patience and looking for the right story to follow, you will find the watch rewarding.",The Night House

Good film but it's strange there wasn't a back story on the husband's victims. This guy murdered three local women in a small town and apparently no one was looking for them. Even when the girls are found the police are never called. It would of been realistic if a detective was attached to the story.

director: David Bruckner
starring: Rebecca Hall, Sarah Goldberg, Vondie Curtis Hall, Evan JonigKeit, Stacy Martin etcA widow begins to uncover her recently deceased husband's disturbing secrets. The night house was very good and a pleasant surprise.My first few positives would be the cinematography, character background and connecting with the main character. As well as the tense tone and building of tension and the Jumpscares. The film was visually fantastic. The setting of the house was perfect for this movie and provided an excellent tone and visual appeal. But the use of fog and the fascinating use of red was a fantastic and creative element to the film that was amazing to look at. I also thought the character background was great. The film went into a great amount of detail into the main characters past and her relationship with her husband, she seemed genuinely happy and because of this attention to detail it made it so much easier to connect with her as a character. The film did such an excellent job at focusing on its main character and making you sympathise with her situation and understand what she was going through. It was well written and hit good emotional beats. The film did such a good job at building its tension throughout and delivering a very tense tone. Playing on the fear of the unknown excellently, and the scenes slowly got more and more intense and frightening increasing the fear and tension for the main character. The tone and atmosphere were the main focus and I loved that. The Jump scares were also excellent but never overused. They were very sudden and excellently timed to really startle you. This wasn't the main focus which I loved, and they were unpredictable.I only had a few negatives for the film. The pacing in the first act was fairly bland with a lack of set up. Some overly awkward dialogue. And the tension and high concept was inconsistent. The film did take a while to get going. With some very slow pacing in the beginning without any form of horror introduced for a little while, also with a lack of set up, with a series of normal day to day scenes and just photos of her ex without any full explanation or development into the next act of the film. Some of the dialogue was overly awkward as well. I think it was for the most part intentional showing how people react with alcohol to a death. But some of the dialogue that the characters were saying was very blunt and awkward to watch and was slightly too awkward and for me didn't come across too well. Finally, I felt like the films high concept and tension was slightly inconsistent throughout. The tension that the film built strongly did stop and start on a fair number of occasions making the pacing clunky in places. And the high concept of the film didn't really kick in fully until the third act making parts of the second and first act seem more simplistic then perhaps was intended.My final positives would be the excellent sound design and performances. The deep themes portrayed. The interesting concept and strong supporting cast. As well as an inventive final act with some strong twists. The sound design was used very effectively here. With the creaking of footsteps or certain situations repeated with the same sound really created a more intense and mysterious atmosphere. The performance from Rebecca Hall was also very strong. Her performance was moving, powerful and authentic and I think she deserves a lot of work from this. The high concept of the film was fascinating. Having a house that looks exactly the same to the house the main character was living in and having woman that looker exactly like her was a great concept for a horror and was executed really well. The film also handled some deep themes cleverly. The themes of grief and how people cope with it as well as people's perceptions and ideas on death and life after death were told through imagery and dialogue and it was a unique and excellent element to the film. The Night house also had a very strong supporting cast. Sarah Goldberg and Vondie Curtis Hall were brilliant here. Their performances were strong, their characters likeable and they had a purpose to the plot. The twist in the final act was very creative and unexpected. Having the man Beth was seeing not actually be her husband but a visual representation of nothing which was what was viewed as life after death was a deep and fascinating twist that led to a very inventive final act. The visual style and creativity as well as the powerful imagery and intensity of the final act really stuck with me and was unique and powerfully done.Overall, despite not executing its deep concept to its full potential. The Night house is an intense and fascinating horror. That manages to connect intellectually and emotionally. Whilst also delivering tension and atmosphere that was excellently executed. With a fantastic lead performance from Rebecca Hall.Overall rating 81/100.",The Night House

52,movieman6-413-929510,The dark trauma of the loss of a loved one and its possible consequences.,6,18 September 2021,"The Night House is a new horror thriller directed by David Bruckner, the director of The Ritual.The film is about the widow Beth (Rebecca Hall), who goes through difficult times after the loss of her husband. When she later learns about his secret sides, she realizes that maybe he wasn't as innocent as she first thought.This film responds well to how someone can go through life after the loss of a loved one and what the consequences can be. The main character of this film isolates herself more and uses alcohol a lot. People who are concerned about her try to help her, but they don't always know the best way to do it. Especially not when she says she sees strange things, but has had a bottle of alcohol for this. The characters, like the viewer, are not sure whether something really supernatural is happening or whether it is just the result of her drinking.The director knows how to question you as a viewer so well, which keeps you interested in the film and continues to follow the main character with what she discovers next or what will happen to her. Director David Bruckner has worked more on horror films for this film and the Ritual, where he partly directed and wrote the films together with others. After the Ritual and this film, he does show that he has become better as a director at directing and writing horror films. In the future, he has to work on a good elaboration of the film for his new planned horror films, because that is missing with this film. So if you don't pay close attention, you won't fully understand the ending of this movie.Rebecca Hall also manages to carry the film as the lead actress, who is traumatized by her loss and alcohol use. Because of her acting, you as a viewer also remain in doubt about what is really going on, until you only get answers later in the film. Sarah Goldberg and Vondie Curtis-Hall also come across as people who try to help the main character in her hard times, but also remain a bit insecure about her and her stories due to her drinking.",The Night House

But it didn't quite go far enough with some elements, and too far on some other character-building elements that I think it could have left out.We spend too much time with Hall's character, and not enough time with the mysterious elements of the story.Having said that, there are no glaring plot-holes, the dialogue rings true, and the setting is interesting enough. I enjoyed that they spent a good amount of time on script and story building, but I felt like it didn't go quite far enough. I wanted to see more of the background of the supernatural elements, as well as some of what the husband was getting up to, which was more interesting than what the wife was getting into.The supernatural elements were filmed very well, and done in an original way that is not often seen on screen.

She find it hard to move on and fall in a state of depression, begins to experience strange occurrences&visions and starts to investigate that something might possibly be wrong with this house, and it's something else might be here with here. This is a horror that's a little bit different then some might be used to. Alot of the drive of the movie is in the dialogue and the scares a more of a supporting factor. While the cast is small they each manages to give a good performance especially Rebeca hall. She gives this feeling that unpredictability as she swaps from being depressed to the next second being manic and laughing. As she becomes more obsessed with her husband what he might've been doing. A fair amount of the scares work well, they feel Just in the right place and don't overuse jump scares some nicely shot angles. The lake and landscape look nice. The best way to describe the overall tone of the movie, it like John carpenters the fog, it relies primarily on its atmosphere rather then it action. There are things that happen in the movie before the finale. Just don't expect jumpscares and loud noises the whole film. There's honestly like one dumb scene in the movie and it involves her findings something instead of call the police she call her find instead.

56,darkreignn,The horror of grief combined with the fear of the unknown,9,22 August 2021,"The stunningly gorgeous Rebecca Hall plays front and center in ""The Night House,"" giving a performance so good that you already know she'll get snubbed by the Academy Awards solely because that performance was given in a horror film. However, is horror even the correct classification for this movie? Both yes and no. You see, Rebecca Hall is so sensational in this movie in portraying grief that ""The Night House"" works best when it is going for straight drama. And luckily, for a majority of the time, it is.Following Rebecca Hall as Beth, a woman who has recently experienced the death of her husband, ""The Night House"" is, first and foremost, a story of loss. Everyone copes differently when their loved one dies, and in the case of Beth, she copes by drinking copious amounts of alcohol and rummaging through her dead husband's belongings. In a lesser film, this could've bordered on parody, but Rebecca Hall treats her role with such dedication that you'll believe everything she does; she gives a naturalistic performance that doesn't feel heavy handed or showy, which is rare for a horror film. And watching Beth undergo this experience is more riveting than it had any right to be. From late night meetings with the bottle to hang out sessions with friends that turn into suicide note readings, Rebecca Hall plays her part to perfection. Even when there is no horror happening, it will be easy to get engaged in the pure drama of watching a woman trying to get over the death of her beloved.What makes ""The Night House"" so good is its drama, and luckily, even when the horror rears its head, the drama of grief is always present. And that makes the horror all the more potent, and terrifying. I found this film to be consistently unsettling, not due to jump scares (which it does have, in moderation) but because of its persistent sense of dread. As Rebecca Halls explores her deceased husband's belongings and discovers disturbing secrets about his past, the tension and the mystery continues to build until you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat, just waiting for the next revelation. Why does Beth hear strange sounds at night, and sleepwalk when she previously did no such thing? Why does she find mysterious blueprints that her husband had drawn up, and books that point toward bizarre, occult beliefs? The movie reveals its mysteries little by little, and as the suspense mounts so does the terror.""The Night House"" isn't in a rush to scare you; in reality you may not believe in the afterlife, or in ghosts, but because the film takes a slow and steady approach to its horror, by the time all the supernatural shenanigans that the trailer teased finally happens, it's all the more believable because of how serious the tone, and the performances, are. Instead of a more stylistic supernatural scare fest, a la something like ""Insidious,"" this movie opts in for minimalistic frights - this is something I appreciated, as less truly was more in this case.There are also some very interesting concepts introduced in this movie, especially if you are a fan of the occult. However, the true glue that held this movie together was Rebecca Hall's fantastic performance, and the movie is truly worth a watch because of her. In the spirit of ""Hereditary"" and ""Midsommar,"" ""The Night House"" shows the horror of grief and builds upon it with the fear of the unknown. And coupled with a masterful main performance, this is one of the creepiest, most unsettling films I've seen in a long time. If this movie is showing in a theatre near you, I highly recommend watching it on the big screen; I don't think you'll regret it.",The Night House

Frankly I kept waiting for her to report this but she never did! Protecting hubby or writer laziness?I dislike open endings.

I get so worried when highly anticipated horror movies, like this one, eventually do come out because more often than not I am left disappointed. However with The Night House, I found myself consistently terrified the last 2/3 of the film. The cinematography, the atmosphere, the sense of dread. But it doesn't stop there, you actually get to find out what is happening and why. Such an original tale on grief, life, death, friendship and of course love. The beginning of the last act leaves you thinking you know what happened but just wait, it's a much more profound and terrifying concept. Rebecca Hall was amazing in here and prior to this I was on the fence with her, but this film was hers and she was so great! Most horror film fans will probably like this for its originality and execution!",The Night House

63,Mivas_Greece,What is after death? This film tries to answer this question with mystery and horror in a unique way. The best mystery film of the year!,7,17 October 2021,"Mystery / metaphysical horror movie. A young woman who recently lost her husband who, without any indication, suddenly committed suicide, is trying to understand why she did it. Searching for his past, he gradually discovers that there were many things he did not know, but most importantly, there was something dark that is now haunting her. Excellent direction along with good music, plenty of mystery and suspense from beginning to end and constant agony, watching the protagonist gradually unravel the mystery of the unknown past until she discovers what is this darkness that follows her. A special presentation of the idea that confuses the viewer until he understands what does not leave her. Without constant terror, it has continuous suspense and enough plot, in a good balance, so that it does not get boring. This film is a typical example of how a simplistic central idea, if presented in an elaborate way can give something very special and unique. What is after death? Watch this movie to find out.

When things do start to happen there isn't enough explaining because the lead actress is always by herself and thus has no one to talk to to explain the situation to the viewer.On the other hand, they try to make up for this with mood that can only really be created by building a sense of vulnerability. Yeah, more vulnerability its that ancient recipe that we have been through over and over.All things considered the characters have nothing going for them. Deadpan, bland, rude and pretentious. Skip the first 40mins, there is no content there and as soon as the moody bits end just jump ahead 5mins each time. One word rating: Unremarkable.",The Night House

67,manuelasaez,"It fails at everything it tries to do, but it tries really hard!",4,10 October 2021,"Good-The best thing I can say about this movie is that the acting is mostly on point. I have almost no complaints there.Bad-The movie is just not a good thriller, it's not a weak mystery and utterly and pathetically fails as a horror film. It's trying to be a scary version of Ghost and it just does nothing note-worthy to be worth anyone's time. In the end, you are left unsatisfied, bewildered and (if you're like me) tired of these ""horror"" films that sell one movie with the trailer and present the audience with something else entirely different when the actual film is watched.That's my main problem with everything surrounding this movie. The advertising was just not honest. There was nothing scary about this movie. Creepy, yes. Unsettling? Maybe. But scary? You'd have to be a college girl whose tastes range in the ""The Notebook"", & ""The Twilight Saga"" of movie tastes to find this even remotely spooky. That being said, I could have excused weak horror if the rest of the plot and script was coherent, and it just wasn't.It wants to be a ghost story, then a ""my husband is a serial killer"", then it starts doing a weird ""The Entity"" thing that just made me lose patience. Seriously, I was going to turn it off at the hour and 30 minute mark, and I wish I had. The ending was uninspired, limp-wristed and demonstrates everything that's wrong with American films these days.Please sped your time with better movies, people. South Korea, Spain and France are making great strides in impressive cinema. Stop wasting your time with this drivel made for bored housewives with bad taste.",The Night House

She is not that good looking and has a somewhat abrasive personality. She talks and looks and talks and looks...that's all she does.So most of the time the story is meandering slowly with the traditional and expected jump scares and for a film that at the beginning seems to be a ghost story we are offered with the also usual and traditional signs and indications that there is a presence in the house.Up until the resolution it is bland, unremarkable and tedious.",The Night House

74,theredsky,The Night House Review,8,3 September 2021,"I didn't go into this with high expectations but I was very impressed with what I saw. This is the kind of horror I wish we would get more of. Some effective and creative jumpscares with interesting stories, characters and a lot of unsettling themes. This film deals with issues like suicide, depression, and mental illness and I think it makes use of them very efficiently to make you feel sympathetic and scared at the same time. There is a lot of ambiguity about what the monster is but in the end it's nothing and I don't mean there is nothing there but it deals with the idea that nothing is something. It sounds confusing but it makes sense with the film. I've never been a big fan of jumpscares but I think it's super effective most of the time here. Most crappy horror film jumpscares get you for a second but you forget about them after they happened and this didn't happen here. The scares stuck with me long after I saw them. David Bruckner's directoral style helps give the film a sense if uneasiness and I think it works brilliantly for this story. Rebecca Hall gave a career best here. Her performance is pretty fantastic at points and her character is the best part of the movie. She feels relatable while having a fun personality that feels realistic. The film's use of color and lighting at points also helps this uneasy atmosphere and the cinematography was super effective at some of these scares. I would highly recommend checking this out. It's one of the more unique and interesting horror films I have seen in a while.",The Night House

76,chi_town_fed,Fake Reviews As Usual,4,6 October 2021,"I don't know about you, but when I see a high rating that contains headlines such as ""Masterpiece!"" for obviously flawed films I automatically consider deducting stars to offset the blatantly false reviews.Does anyone without a specific disability or a medical condition such as a stroke walk around everywhere with their mouth gaped open? I don't. I also do not see anyone else doing so. No. I am not ridiculing wonderful people who happen to have a disability or suffered a stroke.What bothers me the most is a movie with so much wasted potential. This movie could have been intense and extremely captivating. But writers and producers today are just out to make a quick buck. This film could have been memorable leaving the audience craving to see it again or craving a sequel. Instead, it makes a lemon out of a lemon.The lead, in my opinion, lacks the presence to carry the film, especially a poorly plotted one. She does better as a supporting cast member, or at best, a costar. Her only hope of being a successful lead is to be put in a phenomenally written film that will carry her to that next level. Some people just lack the presence or the acting ability to be the lead, male and female alike.You might watch this film out of curiosity. In the end you will feel cheated, mainly because you know in your gut this film had major potential if the right people produced it. I don't see how you cut the film into this final cut, view it and say ""That's a wrap."" versus ""Where did we go astray and how do we fix it?""",The Night House

85,chris_rowe-881-168820,Really engaging performance,8,9 September 2021,"I don't understand some of the criticism of this film, it's like people have no imagination anymore, if you were possessed or harassed by death wanting you to kill your lover and you don't want to the longer it goes on you'd go crazy.You'd look at ways to trick them, ways to by yourself time, ways to satisfy them without doing it and also dark arts No doubt, this is all stuff he does yet people are acting like that needs elaborating on, if your tired stressed and being haunted your not going to tell people especially your gf so you get desperate, that equals careless which explains literally everything, he tried to build an identical house and get a girl as close as possible, pictures for comparison and he forgot to delete them due to stress no doubt, it all makes perfect sense.The leads performance was awesome and really carried the film, it was a late viewing after I watched the new marvel film and this was way more engrossing. It was nicely paced, interesting. A lot of his stuff is maybe left up to interpretation or imagination but clearly that's risky as people get angry if every minutiae isn't explained to them.The only fair criticism I've seen is the ending, although it made sense it was lacklustre, it was convincing that it was over or she was on the mend, the shadow on the boat indicates he's still there. The rest of the cast served their purpose but didn't add much but just added depth in moments to get extra details.Also I guess the girls honesty and help is unbelievable based on what the average human would do but some people are just victims of lies themselves and or don't like dishonesty so whilst a stretch it's not unbelievable as if you liked someone and you find out their dead you'd wanna talk about it and Beth is her only link to him.Overall a film I'd hint heard of or seen advertised but really liked it .

I love a good horror/thriller so when I saw the trailer for this I was obviously interested, the trailer had me hooked instantly and really peaked my interest so I had to watch this film. I went in with the usual thriller expectations of basic story with okay scares. But no, this movie is insane! I don't get scared easily but when I say I was terrified watching this film I mean it. The plot is so good and has you guessing what is happening over and over again, I couldn't put my finger on what was going on until it was explained near the end and I love that. Too many films these days have predictable plots and it really ruins the film, but The Night House is so original and so unique with its story telling that it is just impossible to guess what is truly going on and that is also the best bit, the film is so ambiguous that realistically the whole thing could have just been an illusion, it's amazing! Rebecca Hall is unreal in this also, she is practically in every single scene in the movie and she's plays the character so well and shows her emotions amazingly and that is so key to this movie, I really enjoyed her in this role and I'm so glad she had a hand in the production of the movie too because she clearly had a good influence on this film.

The movie doesn't want you to to feel horror but want to make you sense them as the female protagonist and make you feel in her perception of viewing things which was good.

The acting ability of the lead actress and the amazingly creepy atmosphere alone was enough to carry this film throughout most of its running time.I understand the film's subject matter of grief and tremendous loss, which it portrayed very well for most of the film's duration. But unless I'm missing something, it seems like the filmmakers didn't know how to properly end it and just came up with a rushed solution that literally brings the rest of the film down with it. It's really a shame because this film had such great potential. I haven't felt this let down by a movie in quite a while.

Some of the scares were nice and the film didn't depend too much on the jump scares.I'm torn on the story. Part of me thought it was good, but the other part felt it wasn't so much. I went on the lower end because the ending kind of sucked. (I won't go deeper than that for fear of spoiling it).While the acting wasn't great it didn't suck either. Rebecca Hall brought the emotions of a distraught woman to life in such a way that I felt empathy for her.The runtime was a bit weird for me. Although the film didn't feel like it was two hours long it did at the same time. Perhaps that feeling is due to the fact that the tension build-up was slow, but once it got going time was irrelevant.Overall, a not so bad psychological thriller with a runtime that felt long, but didn't. I wouldn't discourage anyone from going to see it, but I would say go in with an open-mind and low expectations in the hopes of enjoying the film more. Honestly, there were promising parts that ended up letting me down and that's why I gave it a mid-range score.That's all for now, enjoy the show!",The Night House

The mysteries and twists surroundings her husband suicide is very interesting. It's a good drama regardless, there are definitely some scary scene but not over the top. But the one thing that really bothers me is the ending. It's extremely cheesy and a really bad ex machina. I wonder what goes through the writer's mind when writing the ending.

98,FixedYourEnding,No-spoiler review,7,1 November 2021,"The lead actress, Rebecca Hall, is great in these kind of movies (do I dare to say Shelley Duvall in ""The Shining""?) and she does not disappoint in this one as the intelligent, but disturbed widow. This is a non-spoiler review and there is a lot to spoil in this one, so enough to say that if you like suspenseful thrillers with slow pacing this might be a good movie for you to watch.Some of the scenery (dream scenes) are impressive and character buildup is realistic and creditable, so you do feel something for the characters. The movie is eerie and dark, gives you an uncomfortable feeling throughout, but I did not find it especially scary.There were, however, a couple things that could have been done better. Especially in the 2nd half of the movie the pace could have been faster as the audience is starting to get an idea of what really is going on, it could also have a more lasting-effect at the ending.

I can say I was not bored at all but the climax was not up to standard with the rest of the movie. The intrigue is there and you will have no idea where the film is headed but referencing what Stallone said about film is basically ""you have to have and ending in mind and the rest is easy"". The ending here just feels dull although cryptic and disturbing, it leaves too much to be desired which brings this film down a lot. Also, the whole reversal thing almost feels unnecessary, I thought it would be like Tenet or Upside Down or even Malignant only instead of the person it was the world. However, that concept seems to be more about symbolism and doesn't really add much to the story IMO. These negatives seem small too but they affected the movie enough that I was ultimately left unsatisfied.6.5/10.",The Night House
105,realalexrice,Solid,7,21 September 2021,"Another great reasoning for the phrase to not take anything in horror literally as it's very rewarding to see this as the allegory for losing someone to suicide that it is. It can be taken literally and Owen's murders can be real, but it works better as the embodiment of lust literally being killed by him. Even as Beth is constantly told by Claire, she should stop digging into his life because everyone has secrets. All she found that could be verified were the photos of the women on his phone that looked similar to her, which really is what started her snowballing descent towards the end. I don't think so much attention would be called to the fact that everyone has secrets and it's best to leave it be if it wasn't somewhat significant. In addition to that, Beth is constantly drinking, leaving the option open that in her drunken state the plot of the movie occurred as some sort of coping hallucination. Thinking this premise is predictable and has been done before is possible but it does discount the fact that Rebecca Hall does portray someone going through it in such an honest way that she is worth seeing the movie for, and there's some pretty effective scary moments to top off the subtext and atmospheric cinematography.",The Night House

127,afrocut,Split down the middle,6,23 August 2021,"There's a real disconnect between the two scenarios playing throughout ""The Night House"" that really will leave its unsatisfying ending up to the individual viewers taste. On one side of the film director David Brucker, director of the very similarly toned ""The Ritual"", wants you to feel that this is a metaphor for grief, depression and loss. A tone that I rather enjoy in Horror movies, even if it's become to common these days, but Horror movies have always reflected the times in which they were made and what's more scary these days than reality. Unfortunately that leaves the other half of the movie with a straightforward horror narrative tone. This tone, about literal and figurative demons, clashes with every thing we are shown. This leads you to question the story as being from the view point of an unreliable narrator. As some one much wiser than me once said ""You can't have your cake and eat it too"". You have to pick a lane and the movie never seems to. This is made more hard to swallow as you watch lead actress, Rebecca Hall, pick and choose varying stages of anger and sarcasm at random. This only seems to further shift the tone. At one moment she is finding a possible disturbing Secret of her husband's and then lovingly holding him as if to pretend the last scene hadn't happened. This isn't to say she is bad, in contrary, she is doing most of the films heavy lifting and some scenes are fantastic examples of acting. There's also some great use of sound, location and visual effects scattered throughout the film that really add to its creepy vibe and unique imagery. There's enough here to find it interesting , just not enough to find it great .",The Night House

Supposedly knowing this, her husband goes off killing women that look identically to his wife as payment or sacrifice to the grim reaper. Maybe because he couldn't continue killing women he commits suicide.The story plays out like a mystery rather than a horror movie. She finds all these clues he's left behind in his belongings.

This is a beautiful and good movie about nothing and about a woman called Beth (Rebecca Hall), who is dealing with the death of her husband Owen (Evan Jonigkeit), who shot himself with a handgun on a boat in the middle of a lake, which they have under their house.At the beginning the movie introduces us to his story in which we will meet closer with the main protagonist Beth. Movie will take us slowly but intensively through the plot, which is fantastic and very original. This horror movie has very colorful color grading, and that is unseen for the horror genre, because many horrors have dark and sometimes weird color grading. The color grading makes the movie more lively and interesting. Most horror movies have one big problem. The big problem is the high amount of jumpscares when someone will from out of nowhere run to the main character with a random loud sound. This movie does not have this problem with jumpscares and that is much appreciated. Director and writers delivered a horror movie with a small amount of jumpscares and with a dense horror atmosphere. Writers delivered in a very good way very good character development. Actors have a very good performance in their roles.

If so why didn't she call the cops right away?The ending didn't ruin it for me like it did others, but I can see why it was frustrating.

138,benmundie,Please Nominate Rebecca Hall for an Oscar!!,7,31 August 2021,"'The Night House' is a low budget horror film from director David Bruckner who is proven in the genre. Starring Rebecca Hall as a grieving widow who begins to uncover disturbing secrets about her deceased husband.The film is held together by Hall's acting, her portrayal of a grieving woman, sliding in and out of reality is Oscar worthy. Accompanied by the deep themes, her performance adds a realistic element to a film with a plot filled with supernatural material. She is able to take an average, sometimes subpar, screenplay and produce a spectacular portrayal. The supporting cast are also very credible, Sarah Golding and Vondie Curtis-Hall both have great performances that keep the audience guessing as to their characters intentions within the story.The cinematography along with the integration of it into the story is groundbreaking. Most of the shots are beautiful and expertly accompanies the fantastic acting on display, especially in the third act where the film utilises some red settings that contrast the dark colour palette that was previously visible throughout the film. The sound design is also a big achievement and aids the scares and horror aspects of this film. They use sound to both frighten audiences and instil a feeling of anxiousness and build suspense which eventually pays off with some creative and terrifying moments.However, I don't think this film is without its flaws. The runtime for me is just too long with too many scenes that could be cut without any impact on the main plot. Despite a very strong second act, I felt, during the third act, the story took a very long time to achieve the payoff from the key plot points. As mentioned previously, aspects of the script were mediocre meaning that some moments felt unnecessary and out of place.Overall, this was an enjoyable film with plenty of scares and some career defining performances.

142,The_nibs,"Good suspense, bad ending",5,7 October 2021,"This review is for people who either have seen the movie or don't care to and want the gist.A formerly depressed protagonist has just lost her husband to suicide. She continues to live in their shared home and witnesses paranormal activity (or maybe it's just a dream, who knows). She has a very dreary view on life and death because she once clinically died for four minutes and felt ""nothing"" which depressed her terribly. She believes her depression made her husband depressed and caused his suicide. Later she determines he has lead a secret life sleeping with women who look like her, in a house he built to look like the reverse of their's. Weird. Then later still, she determines he has murdered those women. In a fit of despair she begs the ghost she believes to be her husband to come to her and comfort her in her time of need (one would imagine this is the last thing anyone would actually want... He was murdering women who looked like the protagonist after all... So yeah, that's different). The ghost actually turns out to be a demonic entity which was the ""nothing"" that the protagonist faced when she clinically died. It is massively butthurt that she survived, even though it's apparently been years or something since the accident. It decides to possess the protagonist's husband in a bid to get her killed so that the Nothing can reclaim her. The husband tricks the Nothing by killing women that look like his wife in the reverse house. Apparently the Nothing is stupid and couldn't tell the difference between houses or women, even after like twenty women are killed. Eventually the husband kills himself to protect his wife... But the Nothing gains control over her anyways and convinces her to almost kill herself.Think for a moment: The Nothing manages to possess her, beat her to an inch of her life and, not force her, but almost convince her to kill herself.So the Nothing literally didn't need the husband AT ALL.The actress was great and the suspense was good, until the story became terribly flawed and stupid. I would've preferred she discovered his double life was really weird and creepy and leave it at that. I honestly thought she was going to find the house with corpses and one victim left alive, and that the house would be booby trapped, or like some intricate maze, filled with puzzles, where she has to rescue the last victim. But no, we got this. As soon as ghosts entered the equation I knew it was downhill from therein.

If you smashed What Lies Beneath into Invisible Man and slathered in a topping of Insidious, you'd be close.But, it's not all praise, and the big ding on this movie, as others have noted, is the ending.Unlike some, I don't mind unresolved plot points if the conclusion is satisfying or at least justified. I don't mind asking questions after the fact, but the payoff here just didn't cut it. The movie was good throughout and deserved a better send off. The last act was interesting, but didn't deliver on the pacing and mood of the previous acts. The real sins here were in the final scenes, where things stumble awkwardly into credits.It feels as though the director didn't have a final scene, and tried to sum it up in the simplest, easiest possible way, which left me wanting more, and not in a good sense. It wasn't a sequel grab or a surprise plot twist, per se, just a McDonald's ending on an otherwise artisan film.Still, I don't regret the ticket price or the ride. A good movie which teetered on the edge of great a few times but mostly stayed good until it landed in a slightly more meh category.",The Night House
148,choiseburgerz,Solid Creepy Mystery Thriller,10,12 October 2021,"I've been waiting for this movie for several months now and it was well worth the wait. Rebecca Hall is perfect for this role and made the film complete. It's not often enough we get a ghost flick that is original and mysterious and doesn't rely on jumpscares. The creepyness of this film is presented in a way I've never seen before and it's definitely far from on-the-nose, and it worked magnificently.Some of the ""hints"" may seem like they're being too blatant and that you can tell what's coming from far away, but I was surprised that this wasn't the case. The overall story or cause for the mystery doesn't seem impossible either.I really loved this movie. The tangible characters and story are what make it great. And on top of that it's actually scary. Very refreshing to have a high quality ghost film that isn't cheesy or redundant.",The Night House

Basically it sets up the suspense from the get go, making you constantly ponder where this sad tale will go, it has potential.... And still good so far then when it reveals it's true sinister plot lurking in the darkness with Kate playing detective to gain closure for herself, and really pulled me into it at its climax, and just kinda let's you hang on in limbo, really feeling for the character and what's she witnessing constantly till finally... I will leave it there but check this film out if you ain't sure cause I was and I'm glad I did. It's not gory, not even violent really, but it's the current and next unknowns that fill you with anticipation constantly that make it a god d film. Also the cinematography was great especially with the Gothic architecture and such. All in all worth a watch. I rate it a 7.",The Night House

Rebecca Hall is a big reason as to why the film works. Most of the screen time is placed on her and she is able to effectively portray a widow who is slowly losing her mind as she continues to live in the lake house where her husband committed suicide. The film also has around 4-6 legitimate jump scares, but the reason the film works is that it creates a constant ominous feel throughout the whole movie. Additionally, there also may be some plot confusion when watching the film and at times I wasn't able to fully understand what was going on, but absolutely all questions are answered once you get to the credits so please keep that in mind. Overall, I hope whoever's reading this review gives it a chance because this film deserves more success than you're generic cheap jump scare movie.Rating: 8/10.",The Night House

It's more like a terrible super slow paced boring drama that eventually ends with a cheer from any audience patient enough to actually sit through it. Awful!!! From start to finish! Rebecca Hall is unbelievably overrated but Hollywood loves her so we should too. Personally I hate her overacting face. Now I loved The Town and The Prestige but both movies would have been waaaaay better had her part been replaced by another actress! Oh yeah... and this movie is garbage!!!!!!!

Ok so this is not your typical haunted house flick and at points gets really confusing and makes you second guess what you think is going on which happened to me, by the end i genuinely didnt get it and was going to rate this a 3/10, but then i read a review that explained what was going on, so i watched it again, im now glad i read the review and watched again because it made so much more sense and im guessing that some of the low ratings are for the same reasons that ive explained.So if you are confused by this movie give it another look but dont give it a low rating just because you dont understand it.Ok so the acting, atmosphere, sense of dread, direction, eerieness were all on point, its not at all scarey but i dont think its meant to be, i think its more of a moive that wants to make you think like that shadow out of the corner of your eye, was it there or not or that noise in your house, is it just the house or not.All in all id give this movie a go and make sure you pay attention to all the details, 1 clue i will give is that the nothing wants her back.Solid 9/10 from me.",The Night House
162,jovejovejupiter,Creepy Horror and Suspense,8,7 September 2021,"The movie had a good creepy soundtrack which added atmosphere - always a big thing for me in horror films. Also the cinematography and visual settings were nice. Rebecca Hall and the one other younger woman in the film were really nice to look at on the big screen.The concept and main antagonist were actually pretty fresh - not something I can recall seeing in any other horror film. There is a bit of a twist near the end which genuinely caught me off guard. Also you have to pay close attention to some of the minor conversations as there is some hidden exposition going on which will leave you confused if you miss it. There were a few cheap jump scares thrown in which were fun but a bit disappointing that this film had to resort to that. The ending was also anticlimactic as others have noted.Overall really solid horror film, much better than most of the generic stuff these days.

166,jeromebasque,"We've All Seen This Type Of Movie. But This Does It The Best, So Far.",7,7 October 2021,"So we all have seen movies like What Lies Beneath, Lake House, and other movies that deal with a couple whose partner they lost. They are grieving and their life is empty. For some reason these usually take place by a lake or at a lake house. I'm not sure why, but I digress. This was a very cerebral thriller/mystery/pseudo-horror. There were paranormal things that happened, but nothing that is horrifying. Strictly speaking, I choose not to call this a horror movie, as I think any person who was told that it's a mystery/thriller would come out and think exactly that. They wouldn't say it's a horror.The story and cast were above average. Not groundbreaking, but better than most movies that come out these days. There was no forced PC, woke, BS, which is a breath of fresh air in and of itself. I hesitate to say it was a good setting, because as the title says, we have all seen these movies before. What I do think the creator of this did was use a clichéd setting and make a better movie than those that preceded it using that same setting.SPOILER ALERT:Now, I will explain what I think it is pretty clear, but most people are not understanding, and that is the plot and the whys and whats of the movie. The main character's husband commits suicide. She is of course grief stricken. As the movie progresses she begins to feel a presence and experiences weird dreams. Waking dreams almost. So she starts to dig into her husband's past. She finds odd books and a weird voodoo doll. As well as a house he was building. Unbeknownst to her. As she is flipping through these books you can clearly read what the doll is and basically what the husband is trying to do based off what the doll is used for. Couple that with the weird architecture and its purpose and it all becomes clear. There is a dark entity that has plagued his wife ever since she almost died. I say almost because when one says they died and ""saw nothing"", are you really dead? Because you are thinking. You remember. If there was truly nothing, you wouldn't be thinking or recollect that. His wife explains at one point that he was the one that kept her together. She was the one that had dark thoughts and dealt with what sounded like depression, although I don't think she ever says that word. So from my perspective, he embarks on a mission to rid her of this darkness for good. He looks up ways to do it. He finds a way. The way he chooses to take away her pain is to trick the entity with false sacrifices. Reversed architecture. Ways to trick the spirit/entity/whatever you want to call it. So he builds this house that is used specifically for that. He brings women there and tricks the entity by thinking he is using them as a sacrifice. Now here is where I branch off into two directions. One, is that he starts to actually kill the women, as we saw dead bodies under the floor that his wife found, although what she saw throughout the movie at multiple points were either illusions or tricks by the dark entity. The entity even tricks her into thinking it is her husband until the end. It wanted her. Her husband couldn't take it killing these women and the guilt he accrued from it any longer and finally ended it by killing himself. My other theory is that this entity, who has proved to be insidious and a deceiving, makes her believe her husband is this serial killer and that he was an awful person. He does this to break her down to the point where she finally gives herself away to him at the end by killinger herself. The dialogue with her and it in the bow points towards this being the more concrete theory. Now, of course I could be wrong. It could be a mix of both. But I'm pretty sure I'm in the ballpark and would be surprised if I'm not.This movie takes a certain amount of intelligence and attention to understand and hardly anyone has that these days. I'm pleasantly surprised to see a good rating for a ""horror"" movie. I just hope people understand it better and are rating it higher for the right reasons. Again, this is not a simple movie. I'd suggest people that don't understand it, or what I suggest it's about, to watch it again and pause at the parts where she is reading the books. Read the sentences on screen in the books, and not just the underlined ones. Underneath it all this movie deals with ancient rituals and magic.I'm happy to finally be able to write a positive review about something, and to also jump into the story of the movie and pontificate about it in a good way.I don't have many negatives about this movie except for the parts where she is being touched and attacked by the invisible being. I always think anything like that looks off and just kind of brings me out of the movie. Luckily it was only a very small part in this and didn't deplete anything from the movie as a whole for me.",The Night House
167,imbarrand,Truly creepy,10,30 October 2021,Horror movie of the year. Some very clever creepy moments. The story is fleshed out at a perfect pace. You can't rush the reveal and they don't. Rebecca Hall is fantastic in the lead role. Broken by unspeakable grief and then thrown into a complex mystery. Soundtrack is really decent. Supporting cast are very good also. The ending is quite brilliant. Me and my girlfriend had a long chat about what it all means. You can judge for yourselves. Its not all explained too you like a child. It treats you with respect that you can think for yourself. A movie that treats you like an intelligent person. Highly highly recommend this to anyone that wants a great psychological horror experience.,The Night House

But that's not saying much either.What had the potential to be a truly good horror film turned back to tiresome clichés and recycled denouements, including an abhorrent ending reminiscent of just about a thousand other ""horror"" films.What happened to the whole voodoo thing? Sitting at the theater I just knew there would be some mention of voodoo, don't ask me how. When she subsequently discovers the voodoo sculpture in an abandoned house, then hears confirmation from her neighbor, I thought to myself, a smile escaping from my lips, ""Now this is getting good!"" I was wrong. It went all downhill from there. The film went from strange identity thriller to feel-bad-for-the-husband-and-watch-the-wife-overcome-evil bore. Yay, the wife wasn't ""tricked"" - Who cares???This could've been a brilliant film akin to The Double, Enemy, or a plethora of similar films exploring double identity. But it wasn't.

The dialogue and actions from our main character Beth are true to form. She is completely raw, making jokes, throwing her husband's death in people's faces to purposely create discomfort. As someone who has lost a love member to suicide, this is what it was like. I keep seeing reviews say the story was predictable or it was more eerie than scary. Honestly I don't believe this is a horror film. This is a story of a woman's loss and how her mind is trying to process the grief. The night house is not real. None of it is real, the ""spirit"" even tells her it is a dream. Everything she witnesses is her brain desperately trying to put the pieces together to the puzzle of why her husband chose to end his life.

185,mackcrocker,My thoughts,8,25 August 2021,This is my review of The Night House and my firsts impression is that this movie is very deep and also very weird. It starts off a little slow but it picks up a half hour into it. First off I loved all the camera angles and drone shot. I love the scenic shots as well. It had a very creepy atmosphere which made the movie very tense and off putting. The acting was great and I felt everything she was going through. I went into this film knowing nothing and that made it a lot more enjoyable. There were so many twists I would come up with my own theory on how it would end but it kept throwing me curve balls. The ending really ties everything up besides some plot threads that never really get resolved. Overall I really enjoyed this movie I'm going to have to watch it again to see all the clues and all the little hints about what happens at the end. I highly recommend you see this in the theaters. It will have you seeing things in the dark at night that's how creepy this movie is. I give The Night House a 8.5/10.,The Night House
186,HorrorFilmHellion,Worthy to put your phone down for the full running time,8,6 October 2021,"I went into this one knowing nothing about it.. which is a formula I practice more and more when possible. Modern trailers pretty much show you every thing good about a movie, and in a lot of cases, spoils it with idealistic instant gratification. It sets you up for what to expect, and the mind is now prepared and resistant to variation from expectation . This one was more intense and frightening than I was thinking it would be, which caught me a little off guard late at night, in a dark house with the surround sound up high. There is thought-provoking craft in the story, (maybe also even a little purposely vague) to prevent the predictability from square one.. I was engaged and felt there was quite a bit of gothic, or architectural atmospheric intensity that I found thrilling. Rebecca Hall sold this well, and I always find her facial expressions and body language is where it needs to be to provide natural plausibility in her interactions; great work!This was a great film- intense and creepy and only minor disappointments due to a red herring or two. On the other hand, the craft for this story is that posthumous discovery was a significant part of telling it. Some intentional misdirection is not completely unjustified here.

The acting was on point, the mystery was great, and the great reveal wasn't just a huge exposition dump (like in Lights Out for example), instead it was being revealed over the entire third act in a slower, steadier pace which I like. But the ending....!!!SPOILERS!!!The ending was very disappointing, your typical happy ending. I'm no filmmaker but even so in the last 10 minutes I've seen several opportunities where it could've ended. For example when the protagonist is stuck on a boat, gun in hand and Nothing persuading her to shoot herself it could've just ended in an open ending with her pointing the gun at herself (or show her shooting herself right before her friend had the chance to save her). Or why not just have it absolutely vague and open where it would end at the moment where the protagonist was looking up at the two moons for the first time?

From start to finish I was at the edge of my seat mesmerised by Rebacca Halls performance as though her emotions were my own. Well that shouldn't come as surprise as the story is a relatable one about grief and how we as humans deal with it.It's a tale as old as time however the way the story was told was excellent and unique. It follows Beth as she struggles with the loss of her husband but even more with her own beliefs of the afterlife.We watch her go through various stages of grief as she tries to drink her sorrows away slowly letting her pain consume her all the while bargaining with the entity she believes to be her husband. We watch as the nothing she believes is waiting for us at the end become something and finally she can accept her loss and keep going.It was beautifully written and the horror elements were really good, the scares didn't feel cheap.9/10 definitely a must watch.",The Night House

This movie is proof that you absolutely cannot trust the ratings on here. This film is ridiculous, for much of it you may not even be sure what's going on. I won't even bother with spoilers or the premise because it is so preposterous it's not worth mentioning. Suffice to say it's dark, dreary and not at all scary unless the odd jump scare and loud noises qualify. Also everyone is on about the lead Rebecca Hall. I found her annoying and not particularly attractive which was a huge problem for me since most of the film involves staring at her face and watching her reactions to the bumps and noises.As I state in the title this movie is noteworthy in that it is one of the worst cinematic experiences I've ever had. I really contemplated walking out and was just about to when it mercifully ended. I was pissed to be honest that I had waisted my time and money on it.

Oscar-worthy performance without a doubt. The 2nd half felt a bit rushed with some blatant exposition that I thought could have been more subtle in keeping with the tone established is the 1st half. And I wish the occult angle had been better developed, but that's a personal preference - that stuff fascinates me. But it may not matter to a lot of viewers. I actually really like the ambiguity of the ending - purely a psychological downward spiral or genuine supernatural story? I'm not sure there's an answer, and I'm OK with that. The entire movie is metaphor stacked on metaphor, and the themes of grief, depression, and seemingly bizarre coping mechanisms are true to life and feel 100% authentic (again - Rebecca Hall. DAMN). The small supporting cast is excellent, and the cinematography is simply spectacular. I love the twists. I stayed on edge the entire time - you think it's going in one direction, then NO. Sharp turn into something else. Several times. I wouldn't attempt to nail down the ending in any concrete way, and I'm not sure I should. That's the power of this film. Obviously, I HIGHLY recommend, and I think everyone will come away with something different. If you've ever dealt with grief, depression, and existential angst (and haven't we all at some point in our lives?), this movie will definitely strike a chord. Oh - and for us horror fans, Night House definitely delivers. Creepy, surreal atmosphere that builds and builds with a few well-crafted jump scares along the way (and not the cheap, predictable kind). I need to re-watch and delve a little deeper.

""You are right. There is nothing. Nothing is after you. You are safe now.""Note means: There is really that ""nothing-ness"" that you experienced when you died (i.e. The SoD) and it is after you. But now you are safe because I die, so there will be no channel existing between SoD and you (it's like saying ""I will not harm you"").But unfortunately that channel is established since Beth discovers and touches the voodoo doll, although she remains a non-believer-type (you can see that during the conversation she has with Madelyne in Beth's house).SoD now can interact with her physically (touch her) and has all the potential needed to make her kill herself.Beth tricks SoD once again in the boat and does not kill herself.But SoD is there and we know as the movie ends that SoD will do anything till it gets Beth's life.Hope that is clear for people who did not understand some points in the movie.",The Night House

207,boerelul-261-104555,"Not bad, but simply doesn't make any sense",1,26 August 2021,"Please don't read the following if you don't want a major plot spoiler.-Acting good, unsatisfactory ending.-It was difficult to understand what was going on, but in essence what happens is as follows:
-at young age the main character is involved in an accident and was supposed to die, but lives to tell the story. In her 4 minutes of clinically being dead she experiences Nothing. Nothing appears to be a demon or so and decides it's payback time. She was married 15 years and I presume she must have had boyfriends before that time as well, so Nothing takes his time trying to kill her off.-Her husband at one stage is becoming aware of Nothing and in order to distract Nothing husband seeks out lookalikes of his wife and kills these lookalikes in a mirror-copy of the house he partially has constructed on the other side of the lake. During that time no one has ever stumbled upon the development, which must have taken some time and effort to get the cellar, foundations and construction going. She however finds the site in no time, whilst her neighbour walking his dog nearby has never come accross it.-Husband in other words now has become a serial killer, judging by the many lookalikes the main character sees in her visions and the amount of corpses stashed under the floorboards of the copy house. This element in the film is totally overlooked and I can't possibly believe she hasn't seen photos of the victims/missing women, which look so much like her, nor that anybody is talking about this or that searches in the woods around the lakes have taken place. The neighbour confirms that husband was seen with a lookalike woman. The young lookalike lady from the bookstore confirms she was at the copy-house with him and he tried to strangle her, but in the end let her go. No one thinking best to talk to the police. -In order to finally trying to shake off Nothing, husband shoots himself in the head on a little boat in the middle of the lake.-The film then starts with her arriving home after the funeral, but it's unclear how long that is after the suidice of her husband. What was Nothing doing all that time, nothing? Then Nothing starts to harrass her but (as is usual in films like this) in stages and every time a little bit more to the point that she is hovering above the floor and she is being thrown against a wall with a mirror, so he must have some power, but still doesn't kill her, no he is trying to persuade her to kill herself with the same gun that was used by her husband and was returned (presumably loaded?) by the police. Her good friend thwarts Nothing's attempt and the main character wakes up from her trance and the film ends.-What if they lived in a small flat, would husband have rented another flat accross the road? Why makes Nothing such a deal about the whole thing. There must be hundreds of men/women who survive serious crashes and be in a similar situation as the main character was.-All 'n' all I left the cinema disappointed. I would have favoured a less supernatural explanation. I hope Nothing won't return for a sequel.",The Night House

218,patricktday,"Contrived, confused, conspicuous",5,5 September 2021,"The Night House (directed by David Bruckner) is a trite and largely contrived ""horror""/ thriller movie whose somewhat unique concepts fall flat as they are surrounded by cheap jump scares and a predictable investigative plot that is blatantly non-sensical.One of the film's greatest feats is its ability to establish itself quickly. It does this with a degree of subtlety: at the beginning we hear a hushed conversation about a loss and immediately the movie is intriguing.However, this great feat is immediately ruined moments later when the same point is re-established again and again without any subtlety at all. We see a cliche sequence of Beth (who is so forgettable that I had to google her name shortly after viewing this movie) looking over old videotapes of her dead husband, a trope that is very tired at this point. While the first scene left me hopeful for a unique experience, the following ones (such as this) prove this film to be everything but.The movie gets even worse, somehow, at exploring Beth's grief shortly after. Beth is a teacher, although this job is entirely incidental and contributes nothing to the movie other than setting up a single scene with a child's mother for the sole purpose of informing the audience that Beth's husband committed suicide. Although this encounter is meant to act like a ""breaking point"" for the character, we aren't shown enough prior to this moment for it to feel natural. Furthermore, while a line or two about the husband may have been understandable, after all, the writers have to lighten their expository load, Beth instead depicts the entire tale for this stranger (and the audience) and the moment immediately tarnishes any provocative core it had simply by being poorly written and largely contrived. There are several moments like this in the movie, where the protagonist is given the ""trait"" of oversharing to excuse poor writing rather than for any strong characterisation. The film is incapable of discussing mature topics naturally, and each time it wants to explore grief an underwhelming scenario is invented for that sole purpose rather than any dialogue developing naturally - the subject doesn't feel like an intelligent deliberation of grief, it never feels fluid or cohesive; merely tacked-on and uninspired.Similarly, half of the film's cast exists to be exploited for a lack of writing talent. A great example of which is the bar sequence, where an entire group of friends is materialised for Beth in order to pry more exposition about the husband's suicide out of the script. This is the most offensive example of this, as the questions these ""people"" ask are not even in the same realm as the word ""normal"", and the protagonist is once again justified by the writers as someone who ""overshares"" in order to supply this readily available exposition. This group is never seen again and this is their purpose in its entirety - expository dialogue. Hooray.There is another character, an endearing yet slightly ""off"" old man who lives across the lake who exists for a similar purpose, although his is even less tangible. It's fairly indiscernible whether he exists only as a red herring to arouse the viewer's suspicion or a way to further Beth's lacklustre investigation, as he doesn't do a great job fulfilling either role. Regardless, he lacks an identity, doesn't service the movie in any major way, is nearly pointless and yet another example of an obvious need for greater writing talent within the film's script.This character isn't the only red herring, though, there are several: in one scene Beth looks through her husband's diaries and finds blueprints, alongside books on mazes accompanied by several scrawling of these mazes. None of these elements - which at first seem imperative - go anywhere at all. The maze books and drawings pop up several times throughout the movie and yet there is never any correlation to the actual plot. The books themselves link to a character the husband knew, but these could have been any books - why specifically develop this obsession with mazes, show numerous scribbles of them separate from the books, and then provide no payoff to this prevalent theme? The blueprints also provide nothing to the film, like the books, and exist to make the film seem more intriguing than it ends up being. They don't move the plot forward at all. The blueprints are for both the house the movie is named after as well as a hidden shack with bodies under the floorboards. The latter blueprints maybe could have been interesting, since it sort of leads somewhere, but the reason that the protagonist searches for this murder-shack is completely disconnected from the prints, as she sees it in a dream and decides to look for it thereafter. The former prints, however, are wholly pointless. So it begs the question, what's the point? Like a lot of this movie, there isn't one. These promising concepts are solely to divert attention and theorisation away from the obvious plot the movie eventually falls into.Arguably the main plot device that gets the ball rolling are the pictures of women found on the husband's phone and computer. This doesn't make sense, though. It's revealed late in the film that the husband was being tormented by death itself, referred to as ""nothing"" within the movie, and that he killed people that looked like protagonist to fool death into thinking they were Beth, who death wants. So, if the husband hates killing and literally shot himself to prevent causing further harm to others and it was tearing him apart emotionally, why relish in it, snapping sly photographs of the victims and never deleting them? He gains nothing from taking these pictures and it doesn't suit his character. Even if he felt the photos were necessary for some reason, why would he keep them after the women inevitably went missing? It's illogical and nonsensical, keeping these photos around like a present for the police to find. You could say that in some profound way, he was conflicted and deep down, wanted to be caught, but let's be honest - the movie isn't that high brow.When it comes to the lead character herself, it's tragic that her character revolves entirely around the man, her husband, and that she lacks any memorable identity outside of a relationship with him whatsoever. Her husband - despite the audience never seeing him (in the flesh) and him being a literal corpse - is given the more compelling character arc, which is both something to be impressed and repulsed by.The acting is also decent, Rebecca Hall does a good job with a poor script in that you can see some of the characters tics develop as the film ensues. She can also get very emotional at any given moment, a feat which would serve her well if the script could at all be taken seriously. Unfortunately, it cannot, so her acting is in vein, akin to any attempt at ""horror"" within this movie.The movie's idea of a fright is to jump scare the audience with extremely loud, repellent music or sharp audio cues which only made my ears recoil in fear rather than anything else. Although there are some extremely well shot segments which make creative use of environments towards the end, and the reveal of who has been speaking to the protagonist is somewhat worthwhile on paper, it feels sort of gimmicky and underdeveloped, it's at least a decent concept - which is scarce in this movie - but even these concepts fall flat at this movie's delivery.The Night House could have been a good movie, had it capitalised on the several red herrings it placed throughout its narrative, evolving these clues into actual relevancy, or if it made better use of any of its useless characters. However, since it is so abominably contrived, sloppily written and downright forgettable, the movie's mild potential in concept wanes into complete mediocrity upon execution.",The Night House

Personally, I found this to be one of the scariest horror films I've seen. The tension, atmosphere, and sound design is unexpected and eerie, serving as a refreshing deviation from the kinds of Conjuring-esque jumpscares that have become formulaic in the past decade (no disrespect to the Conjuring, but there have been a lot of imitators and sequels that perpetuate the same jumpscare formula)The thing I loved most about the film was the creative use of architecture and space to create horror. In this sense, it feels like an intensification of the 'spatial horror' seen in The Shining and some Argento films. It's a great use of the medium of film combined with architecture, which is used skillfully to accentuate the themes of 'nothingness' within the narrative.I won't give away plot spoilers because I think it's something to simply experience, but I will provide a quote from Karl Barth that, at least in my initial interpretation, decently captures the theme of the film. (Don't worry. The reference to the Devil is not a spoiler).""[...] the infinite menace of nothingness that is opposed to God himself. It is the menace that, for the creatures, carries with it not only a passing danger, a destruction of secondary importance, a momentary corruption, but total fall, ultimate extinction. [...] In it there is nothing good, nothing that can be of any use to us. [...] It is without hope. There is an intolerable, unendurable evil that in no way competes with the good. This threat exists; it manifests its presence. [...] This absolute evil imposes itself upon creation in the form that we all recognize, namely, sin and death. It appears in the illegitimate dominion, incomprehensible and inexplicable, of the one whom the Scriptures call the Devil."" (Barth, Prayer, 60)",The Night House

Maybe back in 2012 with Sinister. Too many directors these days think that loud jump scares qualify as horror. And while this movie has one or two of those, it doesn't need them. I usually finish my soda 5 minutes into any movie. When the credits rolled on this one, I realized I hadn't touched it. It's tense, it's ominous, and you don't know if any of the characters are safe. Both the ""shadow figures turning to look at her"" and the ""wrestling with the invisible man"" stuff was maybe a tad overused. But since you don't know what exactly you're looking at, it's not monotonous. I enjoy the main character for being one of those rare ""I'm so beyond scared that I'm angry"" types. Too many people in horror movies hide and tremble. I appreciate the ones who run toward the strange noises, challenging their tormentor to just get it over with.

228,Sir_Ulrich_Von_Lichtenstein,Ignore the negative reviews (and watch it in a cinema if you can),9,25 September 2021,"Coming from David Bruckner's ""The Ritual"", which I felt was a rather successful and unique take on the creepy-cult-the-woods angle, I felt that ""The Night House"" could potentially at least be either as good or better, and I wasn't disappointed.It has a lot to offer. Suspense, mystery, intrigue, jump-scares (and not of the typical variety) and, amongst others, the kind of bleak horror and dread that resembles moments in Ari Aster's ""Hereditary"", albeit mild in comparison.Perhaps a better example might be Robert Zemeckis's ""What Lies Beneath"", both in theme and atmosphere, although ""The Night House"" is more arthouse and less ""Hollywood"". In other words, not as ""Mickey Mouse"".Come to think of it, certain scenes in the third act even had similar mechanisms and occurrences to Leigh Whannell's ""The Invisible Man"". There might even be more resemblances to that film here than in the aforementioned pieces.At the end of the day, this film is told well, shot well, builds even better and gives you enough information to speculate by yourself without giving it away outright. Some of the other reviewers seem to possess above average skills of deduction as they imply that ""The Night House"" is very predictable and obvious. I don't agree and feel that it is more than worth a watch.In that same vein, some other reviews state that the ending is anticlimactic or disappointing. Again, I would say while not epic, it still concludes well and leaves the protagonist with substantial resolve while suggesting that the threat is likely still present, but that by then she at least knows what/who she's dealing with.It's certainly not your standard jump-scares-and-ghosts trope fest and, depending on one's tolerance, should stay with you well after watching it.",The Night House
229,sophiec35,Eh,4,14 September 2021,Went to see this movie with my boyfriend and he immediately decided he hated it. I tried not to jump to a conclusion and give it a chance. Acting was good and they had some creepy scenes. I'd use the word creepy to describe this movie rather than a horror. The husband also pissed me off. His character just wasn't great. The overall concept of the whole movie was way too complex and just blah. Could have been a lot better if they stuck with a simpler plot and focused more on the scary scenes rather than this confusing storyline that left you wondering what you just watched.,The Night House

231,jordanhaney-89041,Unlike any horror film I've seen in a long time.,8,24 August 2021,"This film is not reliant on jump scares, or gore, and doesn't attempt to be overtly terrifying. This film is different. It relies on camera tricks and illusions to present an entity unlike any I have ever seen before on film.This film is not slow, and every scene feels essential. It builds a sense of despair and dread that escalates over the course of the film. It asks question upon question until the fitting end. I predicted the film's ending by the last 15 minutes, but I was hoping that it would end the way I predicted.What's smart is that this movie presents a metaphor, but does it in a way where the plot isn't challenged and you're not questioning weather the whole film was just a metaphor. You ask questions throughout the film but it doesn't leave you with more questions than answers.The lead actress is fantastic, and you can feel her grief and emotion. I never once said ""that's stupid. I would do this instead"", which is something that always happens at least once in horror films.If you don't mind a horror film that's not heavy on jump scares and is more focused on character and emotion then you should at least find it worthwhile and be able to admire it's uniqueness and execution.",The Night House

It was so atmospheric in the way the horror was presented. It played with visuals as well in a way I've never seen done. I will say this is a movie you need to pay attention to. It's a lot of layers and symbolism. However it keeps you so invested it's hard to miss a thing. I was just on the edge of my seat the entire time waiting for what was next. There were so many different theories I came up with while watching it that the ending was gripping. This movie was a metaphor for grief and the role depression plays in our lives. However, it kept you guessing. You never knew what was real and what was just a delusion.",The Night House

236,olciak-12949,This is actually not so bad movie,7,29 October 2021,"I was kinda positively surprised after watching it. I really like mysterious vibe, and dark picture, also the acting of the main actress is quite pleasing, I don't recognize her that much from many different productions, not that I recall, although I do think that she was a little bit one note. I find this whole aftermath behind her husband's suicide and how ""Nothing"" was playing tricks on her mind very interesting. Unfortunately, in my opinion the action is moving rather slow and is just a little bit boring sometimes. For such a long movie the plot is quite short, the movies is unnecessary dragged out. Dialogues aren't actually that much impressive, and there is no variety if it comes to the characters.The final scene could be handled out a little bit better, but I guess I just like to be picky if it comes to the final scenes. So far it's kinda obvious that ""Nothing"" is some sort of the demon but it's not said straight. I also don't like the fact the ending leaves a lot of guestions behind. Why? Why all of this? Why ""Nothing"" wanted her dead? Why he wanted her husband to kill her instead of trying to get her on his own? And if he was so determined to kill her, how is it possible that he actually really let himself to be fooled by the husband giving him all those innocent girls souls? Isn't that a little bit naive for a demon?All in all I still consider this production quite decent, however, I would not watch it again🤷",The Night House

Overall she was kind of sarcastic. I get that she's mourning and all, but something about her character I didn't like. The idea of the reverse house was interesting too, but didn't go anywhere. What was the point of the reverse floor plans? Why couldn't the husband carry on his plans in any old house?In the end, worth a watch, but don't expect fast pacing or a clear conclusion.

264,gasp_neo,Emotional Horror worth checking out,7,9 November 2021,"As with ""The Ritual"", David Bruckner's ""The Night House"" plays a lot with the idea of a mixture of time and space.The plot is simple - Beth (played by Rebecca Hall) is holed up in her lake house after her husband takes his own life under mysterious circumstances. In addition, she sees visions of her deceased husband, who supposedly tries to contact her.As with Mike Flanagan's films, ""The Night House"" focuses more on drama, while the horror elements stand as a metaphor for grief and the fear of death.Particularly impressive here is the play of perspective, with the protagonist standing in space and the arrangement of space creating the impression of an entity. The aforementioned aspect of space and time is also interesting, even if it seems more like a stylistic device than it does to really contribute to the story.The last act was a bit far-fetched for me, and the moment the abstract gets a personification, I lost the connection a bit.

I found it quite scary in parts and I have to confess it has some of the best jump scenes I have seen in a long time which Bruckner executes with skill and a clear understanding of what makes jump scares so unpopular with audiences. I am a big fan of Bruckner's work and loved the double reveal cleverly woven into the storyline that I personally didn't see coming! The wide expansive score that wouldn't be out of place in a sci-fi movie complements and punctuates the story perfectly. As you can probably guess I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this for a prime spot on your horror watch schedule.,The Night House

274,lunascura-2,"Kudos to Hall, the rest falls short",4,26 August 2021,"I'll start by advising, for those who haven't watched yet, that the film contains content about suicide, guns, violence against women, and abuse of alcohol.Most notably, Rebecca Hall delivers a great performance and demonstrates that she is a very talented actress. Her portrayal of a woman processing the suicide of her husband is remarkable, and if you're a fan of horror that explores the darker realities of the human experience, there is something here for you.The Night House is rife with shadowy corners, gaping black windows, impenetrable fog, and anxious turns around dark corners. On its own, the lake house setting is sufficiently unsettling with swaths of glass windows and doors that are sterile in daylight and, in darkness, threaten to reflect something horrible. The filmmakers take this a step further by embellishing the environment with Escher-inspired CGI manipulation. Most of the special effects are generically creepy but try too hard to be clever and really aren't necessary.If you are not a fan of jump scares, be warned that The Night House uses them with excessive volume. I stuffed my fingers in my ears during one scene because the volume was absurdly loud to the point of physical discomfort.The Night House attempts to capitalize on a pile of tropes from all over the horror flick spectrum. Old fashioned jump-scare horror. Wall knocking ghosts lurking in dark corners. Occult symbols. Uncomfortable examinations of human grief... Love hallucinatory dream sequences? This one has you covered. There are even moments that appeal to lovers of murder mystery sleuthing. The Night House has a little bit of everything.But therein lies its biggest flaw. It tries to be everything to everyone and, in doing so, spends far too long trying but not really succeeding to pull together something satisfying. This is one of those films that leaves you wondering what the hell just happened, and it's not entirely clear, as the credits roll, what was and was not real or even what the screenwriters want you to take away.This film tried to do too much and took far too long to do it, leaving me tired and a little bored with still an hour of screen time remaining. I love character development and a slow dramatic build, and I don't mind flicks that leave room for interpretation, but The Night House could benefit from more judicious editing of not just the footage but also the script. As is, its pace is glacial at times AND the ending fails to deliver on all the promises made leading up to it.If the filmmakers just intended to assemble spare horror film parts into a ""good enough"" summer flick that sells tickets, then I guess they did their job. I'm a fan of many of the themes (and tropes) they tried to stitch together but the end result is full of holes.Not that the flick is all bad. The cinematography is visually interesting and there are a few unexpected moments that work well and are appropriately unsettling (to avoid spoilers I'll just note the ""fence jumping scene"" as one of my faves and leave it at that). The brevity and abruptness of these moments stand out against the more heavy handed indulgences of the rest of the film.I'm giving it a 4 out of 10 since the cinematography was visually interesting and the lead's performance was noteworthy. Rebecca Hall carries this film and without her it would have been as empty as the windows of her character's lakeside home.",The Night House

Striking the audience ears with very loud screeching sound after complete silence - this is not a jump-scary, this is stupidity and amateur. And there are several such scenes, by the end of the movie it really starts to annoy.Second - this is not a thriller. Main heroine starts some sort of investigation after her husband's suicide and... It leads to nothing. All that intrigue shown in the trailer is gone right after the visit to the bookstore. During this investigation we don't receive any updates about the other house, about the victims of her husband, Owen, or at least about their current house that was promised to have secrets. A lot of intrigue about nothing leading nowhere.P. S. Be aware you'll have to listen to 'very interesting' dialogues with pauses for 10 minutes.",The Night House

282,AustinMorgan776,Chilling and unforgettable,9,25 August 2021,"Wow. I rarely ever get scared since I'm so desensitized to horror nowadays, but this film genuinely creeped me out. I'm kind of in shock as I'm writing this, because I honestly haven't seen a recent horror film in years that has been THIS good.Rebecca Hall truly carried this film, and without her it wouldn't be what it is: a truly unforgettable experience. From the chilling atmosphere, to the unsettling imagery, and compelling story, I literally found myself not wanting this movie to end. Although it's a slow burn, I never felt bored because this film trusts its audience instead of spoon feeding information to the viewer, which I really appreciated.There is also so much emphasis on the stigmatization of how someone should behave while they're grieving. I really felt for Beth's character and I wanted to hug her the entire movie. I cannot say enough about how raw Rebecca Hall's performance was. She really gave this role her all, and she deserves an Oscar for it.Even though I saw the major ""twist"" coming from the trailers alone, I didn't suspect it to go where it did. I'm still pondering the whole concept that was revealed. So if anything, I think this movie would be even better after multiple viewings.",The Night House

But it let's itself down when the invisible man makes a 2nd appearance. Its making us see the mental health is important and that we can escape the darkness of depression. We have ppl around us. And there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Which is all very important. But I don't want to watch a public information video.

287,saucyrmd-79151,Rebecca Hall Amazes While Story Fizzles,7,6 September 2021,"First off, this isn't a 1/10. Please review movies responsibly.Rebecca Hall is absolutely brilliant and the cinematography is superb at times. I was genuinely frightened and some of the 'horror' sequences were top tier. I'm glad I experienced the film but I'll most likely never watch it again.The supporting cast was pretty mediocre and I'm with a lot of people that the ending left a lot to be desired.",The Night House
288,riemerbusiness,"Thrilling and chilling, but ultimately confusing",4,17 August 2021,"""The Night House"" is a thrilling and absurdly suspenseful horror film led strong by Rebecca Hall's outstanding performance as a darkly humorous widow, but it ultimately misses the mark. The movie's plot involves a woman who begins to experience odd occurrences after the death of her husband. She investigates into what she's seeing and every night she experiences visions of replica homes, mistresses, and a shadowy figure haunting her. Hall's performance is incredibly enjoyable and it honestly anchors the film for me. The movie constantly makes you think, and explains nothing to the viewer, whereas lies the issue. I had absolutely no idea what was going on, and this is coming from a guy who thought ""Inception"" was simplistic. I could see that director David Bruckner knew exactly what he wanted to do, but in this moviegoer's opinion, I don't believe he knew how to execute it quite right. The plot points of the film felt heavily disjointed and I couldn't quite connect the dots at any one point. At the end of the film, I expected about 30 more minutes of screen time. Nothing felt wrapped up. Eventually while walking out of the theater, I asked some fellow moviegoers to explain to me what I have just watched, and through their limited (but more vast) understanding of the movie, they explained the plot which still left holes for me but gave me a basic grasp on what was an overly symbolic and far reaching story. I had a good time and I enjoyed the experience, but if I feel like I have to be in the writers room to understand a movie, it simply doesn't work.",The Night House

291,mergeta,Generational Horror Film,10,6 May 2021,"I was lucky enough to see this when it premiered in Jan. 2020 in Sundance. I lived in Utah at the time and have always been a huge film fan especially horror. I saw five films at Sundance that year , all horror at their midnight section of films and none of them or anything I saw that year was scarier than the night house. Less is more , and the plot is really what stool out for me. If you love films like hereditary and it follows this is the next best of decade film for you. It's very dark in plot and goes to a rough place but man, is the ride full of scares that will leave you thinking about what happened to her husband and what happens when we die a year later. The film should get credit for how it's use of sound re-invents the jump scare , anything more would be giving away too much . Go see it in July and keep your lights on at night for weeks !",The Night House
292,horrorcrazy-48345,Subtle and original. Loved it!,9,29 October 2021,"The Night House is slow burning, very atmospheric and goes in some wonderfully unexpected directions. The whole film is shot beautifully and Rebecca Hall's performance is thoroughly gripping and convincing throughout. Don't have this on in the background, turn the lights off and get involved. If you're after quick, gory thrills and spills you'll be disappointed but if you want to feel unnerved and be caught off guard then The Night House comes highly recommended! The screenwriters are apparently working on the upcoming new Hellraiser film and while The Night House couldn't be further from Pinhead and the Cenobites, it definitely bodes well for an intelligent and well done 'reboot'.",The Night House

Those who expect ghost stories and hauted houses and demons and exorcism will be kind of disappointed. This was one of the best and profound movies I've seen in the last 10 years.It makes you think. Rebecca Hall is awesome and she is really believable. The movie has a twist and it's not what it appears to be. Really surprising at the end. And it was a really good ending. If it wold have stuck with a classical horror/ghost story ending it would have been a bad film. But the story is really good. The ""spooky"" moments are not that spooky as some might say. It was a very good dosage of suspense/mystery/thriller/philosophical elements. I was about to skip the movie at cinema because of the comments here. But I took the chance and I was glad that I did.

She tries to recover from the suicide of her lover by seeking through the nature that surrounds her and, suddenly, she falls into an existential crisis that can be portrayed in many different ways.I took this movie very seriously and I think that everybody that suffered from depression can understand how beautiful and human this movie is from the part where she understands that everybody around her feels nothing of what she really is going through in that particular moment.Personally I recommend this movie to everybody.If you want a nice and genuine thrill than it's ok for me but honestly, if you really want to enjoy this movie try to see it as a romantic picture of a fallen dream made by a young woman.

I liked the ending very very much but the thing is that my point of view in explaining what happened and the identity of the presence or the entity is rather different from what I see in the reviews...
I think that her near death experience was the corner stone for what happened after ...and that entity is ""death"" himself which considered that he owns her after her NDE and he refused the idea that she escaped from him .... So he hunts her husband to force him to kill her to regain what he owns , but the husband refuses and turned into a sort of a serial killer that kills girls that look like her to cheat or compensate death but that doesn't work and he is still hunted by death .... Until a point he loses it and decides to commit a suicide .... Then the entity "" death "" decides to hunt her personally to make her kill her self .... That's how I explained the end

311,Anax_Klown,You got it aaaaall wrong,8,8 November 2021,"This is my first review ever after tons and tons of films I've watched. Not because The Night House shocked me or was my any means perfect, but because by reading most reviews I noticed a big misunderstanding I'd like to clarify.The Night House IS NOT A FREAKING GHOST STORY and it's unfair to be refered as one. It is an existential horror flick, a homage to Sigmund Freud's Todestrieb theory, a film about the struggles of depression, a film which only people with dark thoughts will instantly ""get"" it.I'm not gonna praise Hall's excellent acting or analyze the plot thoroughly. I wanna say that I was confused too for a moment due to the ambiguous nature of the script. Was the presence of Nothing ""real"" or it was just about a depressed and schizophrenic person who tried to ""rationalize"" her grief combined with her husband being a cold bloody murderer? Was the Void omnipresent since her near death experience or it was all in her head?The answer comes if you ""decode"" Owens death note. The duality of the note and the fact that it was written in capitalized letters was pretty clever. ""NOTHING IS AFTER YOU"" can be transleted as ""nothing is after you"", like noone is after you, but if it was written like ""Nothing is after you"" it would have been much more clearer. So, Owen knew. He knew... Nothing! He met It, he tried to cheat It, he tried to distract It, but in the end he succumbed to the vast nothingness of Death, reminding us, just like Beth, that once you ""touch"" Death's cold hand you will always carry him with you.
