0,Leofwine_draca,Grisly black comedy with unforgettable scenes,8,17 March 2015,"A controversial adaptation of the controversial Brett Easton Ellis novel, this is actually a brilliantly conceived movie that sheds new life on the disturbed world of the serial killer – and as such may be the most innovative ""psycho"" movie since, well, PSYCHO! Filmly embedded in a hilariously '80s setting, this is both a thriller and a biting satire of the decade, with tons of subtle comedy and lashings of black humour to make the grisly subject matter a lot easier to digest.It's a wonderfully shot movie with plenty of memorable scenes, such as the infamous chainsaw murder, or the bit where Jared Leto gets an axe in the face. The movie works so well thanks to the strong acting which really makes it entertaining. Christian Bale is outstanding, a wonderful and scary and believable performance as a emotionless psychopath who realises that his own murderous inclinations are evil but is unable to do anything about it. His performance never falters for a moment.Similarly, the supporting cast of quirky characters are excellent – Reese Witherspoon's dumb-as-nails bitch; Samantha Mathis's junkie; Willem Dafoe's weirdo detective, plus a vivid array of minor roles. Although the movie is violent and pretty disgusting in places, it remains watchable and entertaining throughout thanks to the quirkily playful script and Bale's engaging performance. Definitely worth a look!",American Psycho
1,SnoopyStyle,unable to care,5,31 October 2014,"It's the 1980's. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a privileged 27 year old Wall Street investment banker working for his father. He's a master of the universe type living in a pristine apartment. Jean (Chloë Sevigny) is his suffering secretary. Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon) is his annoying fiancée. He's sure that she's having an affair with Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux) while he himself is having an affair with her best friend Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). On top of his materialistic vapid daily existence, he has bloodthirsty nights that gets more and more out of control.Director Mary Harron is doing a slightly surreal horror slash comedy. The major problem is that I don't really care about anybody or anything in this movie. There are some witty moments like the business card oneupmanship scene. However I just couldn't bother with the annoying boorish selfish character. At some point, the movie started to bore me. He's not funny and the movie isn't really that funny either. It's not scary as a horror. There is no tension since I don't about him or his victims. I just can't make myself care about this movie.",American Psycho
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Shocking perhaps, but ultimately not memorable at all",4,31 March 2017,"I think it is safe to say that almost everybody over the age of 25 has at least heard of the film ""American Psycho"" and so so many have also seen it I am sure. I myself have not until today, so I was certainly curious how this one would turn out. The film runs for slightly under 100 minutes (including credits) and was made back in 2000, so not too long anymore until it has its 20th anniversary. This is the most known work for most of the people involved in the making here, especially director Mary Harron, who is also one of the two writers who adapted the Bret Easton Ellis novel. And even with Bale having the Batman movies in his body of work and an Oscar for a boxing movie, there are still many people who think his turn as Patrick Bateman is still his career-defining role. The character's name said something even to me without having seen this film.But I must say that ultimately I was very disappointed. Bale is an actor who always gives it his everything and the result is that sometimes he is just tremendously good, but on other occasions he is also off the mark and slightly on the hammy side and there were moments like that in ""American Psycho"" too, for example in the one shot with all the blood splatter that reminded me the television show ""Dexter"". Anyway, I still think he elevated the material overall here and is one of the better components. The film itself is a mess in terms of the script at times especially. I think the best moments were probably all the ones in Bateman's apartment and I am not just talking about the bloody murder sequences, but also the conversations. Bateman seems like a cold-blooded killer at times, but then you also feel that it is inside him and that he tries to fight it even, for example when he tries to protect his assistant from the beast that he is. And even if he killed several male characters, especially early on, he is a complete misogynist and I am not somebody who uses this term lightly. Just remember the ""head on a stick"" quote or so. That even shocked the other bankers at his table.Anyway, people who like Bale will probably enjoy this film more than usual. I personally also like Witherspoon, Dafoe and Leto for example and I felt that this trio was so underused and wasted in here. Of course, you can make a point that it is all about Bateman, but still. Dafoe's character is the best example. He seems to smell something is wrong with our ""hero"" here, but it's not about arresting Bateman, not even after the confession and the best example is how the film ends. The very last shot. I will not go into detail about this one any more. You will know what I mean when you see it. Anyway, overall very little is really memorable here apart from Bale's performance perhaps and the general subject. But there are hundreds (maybe thousands) of other films about serial killers out there that aren't worse to be honest. And these do not get 1% of the attention that this one here is getting. After watching this one, I can see why critics do not like it as much as general audiences. I think ""American Psycho"" is a really overseen movie (does that word exist? the opposite of underseen) and also very overrated. If you are among the very few who haven't seen it yet, I suggest you keep it that way. You really aren't missing too much.",American Psycho
3,claudio_carvalho,Dellusion or Real?,7,14 September 2017,"In New York, the narcissist investment banker Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) works in the bank of his fiancée's father and usually has dinner with his shallow coworkers at fashionable and expensive restaurants. Bateman worships notorious serial-killers, such as Ed Gein or Ted Bundy, and he is a psychopath. When his co-worker Paul Allen (Jared Leto) shows a business card of better quality than his, Bateman plots to kill him using the name of another colleague. He murders Paul with an ax and tapes a message in his answering machine telling that Paul is travelling to London. Soon the private detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) investigates Paul's disappearance and interviews Bateman. Then Bateman hires two prostitutes to spend the night with him doing kinky sex and he tortures the women. Bateman tries to kill a homosexual co-worker; murders a model; and tries to kill his own secretary. Who will stop his crime spree?""American Psycho"" is an ambiguous, dark and dramatic thriller about a sick yuppie that cannot control his death wish. The viewer never knows whether Patrick Bateman really kills the persons or is delusional with a perverted mind. The black humor and the mystery of the last scenes creates the doubt in the viewer. My vote is seven.Title (Beazil): ""Psicopata Americano"" (""American Psycho"")",American Psycho
4,kosmasp,Behind the Mask,9,13 September 2010,"While I haven't read the book and it clearly is playing in another era, than it was filmed, this still has quite something to say about our society. While I'm pretty sure this was also in the book, the really weak follow-up to this, showed us that even with a great source material, you don't have a guarantee that the movie will be great. In this case and with Christian Bale on great form (maybe only his part in the Mechanists overshadows this performance to date, end of 2010), with a very quirky and darkly funny script.While everyone is talking about the ending, this is exactly what the filmmaker wanted us to do. And I love it, because it adds another layer/level to the whole movie. Which is just great. And in case you haven't read the book either, this is not for the faint hearted. Be advised that this does deliberately offend and provoke. You may not like what you see. Actually it would be a big surprise if you really liked the characters at all. But that's the point. Which could also work as a downfall for the movie. But it is handled with great care by the director.",American Psycho
5,classicsoncall,"""I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.""",8,26 August 2012,"I've been letting my thoughts for this film percolate now for about twenty four hours, so before any more time goes by I'll try to get it all down here. I thought there was something up with the picture when Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) and his cronies were comparing business cards for the first time. I got the impression that it was all a sham, that none of them were actually Vice Presidents of Pierce and Pierce, and that they were actually role playing the position of executives in anticipation of an eventual promotion. Bateman himself never seemed to do any work, other than having his secretary line up his appointments to meet associates or clients so he could spend additional time not working some more.The bigger tip off that this was possibly all just an imaginary story was the 'Feed me a stray cat' scene. By this time it was pretty well established that Bateman was unhinged, but the question is, to what degree. Did he really engage in those prior killing sprees or did he just imagine it? Or a third possibility, was he envisioning what it would be like to go completely berserk if all bets were off and he could completely get away with it. By the time the story's over, I think you'd have to be open to all these various interpretations, because in the 'real' world, you wouldn't have a realtor showing an apartment where bodies hung in the closet just days before.Going in, I had some trepidation when the DVD opened to a menu screen suggesting a splatter flick, and if I'm not mistaken, an image of a chain saw somewhere along the way. I've seen a couple of slasher/gore films in my time, and though I'm not that squeamish (any more), that kind of stuff does nothing for me. So anticipating a chain saw scene, I could only groan at the impossibility of the physics involved in poor Jean (Chloe Sevigny) taking a direct bull's eye hit like that at the bottom of the staircase. Just one more suggestion that this wasn't really happening.And what of Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe)? What happened to him? Was this Bateman's guilt becoming manifest, either because of an actual murder or because of his own malicious thoughts? Generally I get really upset about movies like this because they tamper with one's ability to follow a coherent story and come to a reliable conclusion about what happened in it. But then again, it's got the word 'Psycho' in the title, so I guess all bets are off. Personally, twenty five dollars for a couple of drinks at a trendy New York City night club is about as psycho as I'll ever get.",American Psycho
6,gavin6942,Dark Commentary on 80s Wall Street Culture,9,16 April 2007,"Patrick Bateman is a heartless man with no concern for those around him. Serial killer... or capitalist? This film explains there might not be much difference and perhaps shows us why serial killers in the 1980s were more celebrated than any time before or since in popular culture.This is not a film for everyone. Some (like myself) will love every little aspect, while others might be turned off my the sex and violence... or just be really confused by the style (the directing is weird, but actually pretty straight-forward once you've read the book). I suppose that is to be expected. Even those looking for a horror film might be let down, as that isn't the real focus here.The cast of this film is amazing. Willem Defoe needs no introduction. Chloe Sevigny (one of my favorites), Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon (not my favorite but good for her role) and Gwen Turner. Even Samantha Mathis shows up. But, of course, stealing the show is Christian Bale.Bale was the perfect choice to play Bateman and I'm glad director Mary Harron would settle for no one else (turning down Ed Norton, who gets compared to Bale but remains inferior). Bale is able to be any character he wants (comapre this to ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"" and especially ""The Machinist"" and see if there's any of the same characters here). As Bateman, he is perfectly self-absorbed and also maniacally distant. The little dance during the Huey Lewis scene (one I have heard he added himself) remains for me one of the two key scenes (the other involving a chainsaw).Besides the great acting (the real reason to watch this), the music is very noteworthy. The book does a fine job of elaborating on the music of the 1980s, and I think they incorporated that well here (throwing it in to death scenes rather than as solo pieces adds an interesting twist). This film, along with the gentlemen I go to the tavern with, really got me into Huey Lewis and Phil Collins. Which is really wonderful. Not so much on the Robert Palmer or Whitney Houston...I guess I should also compliment them on the tasteful way (read: artistic) the sex and violence was done. Ax wounds, chainsaws and bite marks... threesomes and science-knows-what done with a coat hangar. But the vast majority is shot from such angles that it's almost all left to the imagination: you think you see more than you really do.Clearly, I really want you to see this film. It's possibly Bale's best, or at least the one that pushed him into the spotlight. He steals the show. You won't like it if you don't like horror, but the title is ""American Psycho"" and the cover has a man with a knife, so you know what you're getting yourself into. Grab some popcorn and a Cherry Coke Zero and kick your feet up. Enjoy!",American Psycho
7,lee_eisenberg,a searing indictment of '80s yuppies,6,16 June 2005,"""Wall Street"" showed America's billionaires as worthless human beings, but ""American Psycho"" goes one step further: it tells of a Gordon Gekko-type who is actually a murderer. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is quite possibly the most despicable kind of person imaginable. For starters, he's as vain as can be: only twenty-seven years old, he is already using excluding mask. He has gotten a job in his daddy's firm and spends all day listening to CDs while his secretary does his work for him. Whenever he and his equally despicable buddies (or is that ""cronies""?) get together, they brag about their business cards. When Patrick sees that his friend Paul has a ""better"" business card, that's the end of Paul. It ends up that Patrick just kills almost anyone.""American Psycho"" is really a slam on the whole stock broker culture. But it seems that such people deserve to get slammed.",American Psycho
8,jboothmillard,American Psycho,7,15 June 2005,"I first saw this film during my time in college, I maybe saw it a couple of times after that, but years later I could only remember the obvious bits and pieces, and I knew I needed to get a better opinion on it, so I was glad to watch it again. Basically, set in 1987, in New York, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a successful, wealthy twenty-seven-year-old Wall Street investment banker. His life revolves around trendy restaurants, with a circle of wealthy and shallow associates, most of them he hates. He also keeps up appearances for his fiancée Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon), whilst having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). He has a morning routine of exercises and beautification products, a designer wardrobe and an expensive apartment with matching furniture. He also loves pop and rock music, he has a collection and a scholarly knowledge of his favourite artists, including Huey Lewis and the News, Genesis, and Phil Collins. Bateman and his associates flaunt their business cards in a display of vanity. When associate Paul Allen (Jared Leto) produces a superior business card, Bateman angrily murders a homeless man (Reg E. Cathey) and his dog. At a Christmas party, Bateman is mistaken by Allen as another co-worker. Bateman gets Allen drunk and brings him back to his apartment. While playing ""Hip to Be Square"", and talking about the song, Bateman murders Allen with a mirror-polished axe. He disposes of the body, then enters Allen's apartment to pack clothes and make it appear that he has gone to London. Bateman is later question by private detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) about Allen's disappearance. Bateman takes two prostitutes, who he names Christie (Cara Seymour) and Sabrina (Krista Sutton), to his apartment and talks about the band Genesis. After they have sex, Bateman brings out coat hangers he uses for bodily harm. They later leave his apartment evidently bloodied and mistreated. Bateman tries to kill colleague Luis Carruthers (Matt Ross), after seeing his new business card, but in the restroom, Luis mistakes his attempt as a sexual advance and declares his attraction for Bateman, who flees in disgust. After Bateman murders a model, and keeps her head in his refrigerator, he invites his secretary Jean (Chloë Sevigny) to dinner, suggesting she meet him at his apartment for drinks. While talking, Bateman holds a nail gun to the back of her head, this murder is interrupted by a call from Evelyn on the answering machine, and he asks Jean to leave. Kimball meets Bateman for lunch and tells him he is not under suspicion in Allen's disappearance. When Kimball interviews Bateman again, but tells him that a colleague has spotted Paul Allen in London. Bateman is relieved by the news but confused and begins to doubt himself. Bateman invites Christie and his acquaintance Elizabeth (Guinevere Turner) to Allen's apartment for sex. After killing Elizabeth, Christie runs, discovering multiple female corpses on the way out. A naked Bateman chases her and drops a chainsaw on her as she flees down a staircase, killing her. Finally growing tired of Evelyn, Bateman breaks off his engagement with her. That night, as he uses an ATM, he sees a cat, and the ATM displays the text ""feed me a stray cat"". He is about to shoot the cat, when a woman sees him, so he shoots her. Police arrive at the scene and chase him, but he shoots and kills four cops. He enters an office building and kills a security guard and a janitor. In an office, Bateman uses the phone to call his lawyer Harold Carnes (Stephen Bogaert) and breaks down as he leaves a message on the answering machine confessing his many murders and the horrific things he has done with the countless bodies, including cannibalism. The following morning, Bateman visits Allen's apartment, expecting to clean up Allen's remains, but it is empty and up for sale. The realtor confronts him and cryptically tells him that the apartment does not belong to Paul Allen, before ordering him to leave. While Bateman goes with colleagues for lunch, a horrified Jean finds detailed drawings of murder and mutilation in Bateman's office journal. Bateman sees Carnes at the restaurant and mentions the phone message he left. Carnes mistakes Bateman for another colleague and laughs off the phone confession as a joke. Bateman desperately explains who he is and again confesses the murders, but Carnes rebukes it as impossible, as he recently had dinner with Allen in London. A confused and exhausted Bateman returns to his friends. Left with the possibility that no one knows he is a murderer, or that he simply hallucinated the various killings, Bateman realises that he will escape the punishment he feels he deserves, and that his confession has ""meant nothing"". Also starring Mulholland Drive's Justin Theroux as Timothy Bryce, Josh Lucas as Craig McDermott, and Bill Sage as David Van Patten. Bale gives a brilliant performance with an impeccable American accent as the good-looking executive with a dangerous personal life, the 80s era costumes and backgrounds are convincing, and the murders are both brutal and darkly funny, the ending can have different interpretations for viewers, but overall, it is a most worthwhile satirical black comedy horror. Very good!",American Psycho
9,rmax304823,"If It's a Joke, It Got By Me.",3,14 May 2007,"I didn't read the novel, only reviews of the novel, but I'm not sure that makes too much difference. A movie more or less stands on its own two feet. Or else it pretty much drops as dead as this one does.It has two very good features: (1) the performances, especially Christian Bale's as the homicidal loony, and (2) the art direction. You've never seen such opulence, spare and shiny and sterile.The problems lie with the script. It takes us through the days in the life of Patrick, who begins his mornings with some kind of horrifying bikini wax all over his face, then lounges around his office competing for nasty cracks with the rest of the boys, and ends up with mayhem of a particularly gory sort. I couldn't put the climactic reveal through any kind of step-down transducer that made sense. You mean ""it was all a dream""? I didn't find the blood sickening but found the characters and their values to be enough to gag a maggot -- excepting the winsome Chloe Sevigny and Willem DaFoe's affably ironic detective. The rest of them were about as appalling as the characters in ""Bonfire of the Vanities."" Who wants to sit through such a parade of narcissism for two hours? Don't we get enough of that from Washington? And this thing has been described as a comic/horror film. The phrase lends new meaning to the word ""comic"". What the hell is funny about it? Listening to Bateman's spiels about how deeply profound 1980s rock was? Is that funny? Or waltzing around in a plastic raincoat while preparing to chop a colleague into bits? Is THAT somehow amusing? Well. I'm kind of thinking it over and, yeah, I guess there is one comic element to the film. It's that it was taken seriously.There's a moral lesson here though. Please take this down. Yes, it will be on the exam. A slasher movie doesn't become a good feature film just because you've spent a lot of money on it and based it on a best-selling novel. Now pardon me while I go slit a vein.",American Psycho
10,Tweekums,An amusing satire about a psychotic yuppie,8,5 September 2008,"When I first watched this I wasn't sure what to expect as I recalled the fuss when the book was first published, thankfully the film wasn't too gory. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that it was more than just another serial killer film, as well as that it was a very funny satire about '80s Yuppies.Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a self obsessed twenty seven year old who works on Wall Street. He and his colleagues are obsessed with having the best items and dining at the trendiest places. In an early scene Patrick and his colleagues compare business cards and he is mortified when one of the others has one which is more tasteful than his, even though they all look virtually identical. Strangely this seems to bother him far more than the fact that people routinely mistake him for other people. He uses this anonymity to invite out a fellow stock broker then murders him with an axe while calmly explaining how he thinks the band Genesis improved under Phil Collins influence. As the film progresses his psychosis deepens and he starts killing more and more people including a homeless man, a model and a prostitute he calls Christie.It is never one hundred percent certain that he is in fact killing people or if he is just delusional, I used to believe the latter but on later viewings think how he was getting away with his crimes was part of the satire, I liked that there are hints at both possibilities.Christian Bale's acting in this was superb, he seemed far more chilling than most movie serial killers in that while he is clearly insane he is also no different from those around him on the outside. I also thought Chloë Sevigny acted well as Patrick's secretary, possibly the only really normal person in the film.",American Psycho
11,BA_Harrison,"Businessman Bateman makes a killing, both at work and at home.",9,6 July 2010,"Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a wealthy, good-looking Wall Street businessman with his own office, a pretty PA (Chloë Sevigny), an attractive fiancé (Reese Witherspoon), a desirable Manhattan apartment, and a fine collection of sharp implements and power tools, perfect for hacking up hookers and ridding himself of pesky professional competition.American Psycho, based on the controversial cult novel by Bret Easton Ellis, is a razor-sharp satire of the yuppie lifestyle that will forever be associated with the late '80s, an era when success was often measured by how much money you earned, who you knew, what suit you wore, and which restaurants you could get reservations at.Bale's narcissistic Bateman epitomises the yuppie stereotype—self-obsessed, materialistic, power hungry, and predatory, his life is dedicated to feeling superior to all those around him, no doubt because that, secretly, he knows that he is devoid of genuine worth: his position in the company is shared by several indentikit employees (so alike that there are frequent cases of mistaken identity); his fiancé is having an affair (but then so is he); and the only person who truly likes him (apart from himself) is his secretary, who he stupidly deems unworthy of his magnificence. Deep down, he's a very insecure and confused individual.To compensate for his shallow existence, Bateman extends his lack of empathy and ruthlessness much further than most: he not only humiliates and dominates all around him, both at work and at play, but he also kills!Both the book and film have been accused of being overly violent and misogynistic, and it is true that many scenes are extremely disturbing and very gory, with extreme brutality frequently dished out casually by an emotionally disconnected Bateman; but not only is American Psycho a very unsettling affair, it is also a very funny one (particularly for those with an extremely dark sense of humour), with hilarious satirical displays of oneupmanship between the high-rolling yuppies, amusing deadpan critiques of popular music as Bateman casually prepares for more bloody mayhem, and towards the end, several scenes of sheer unbridled lunacy (try keeping a straight face as Bateman attempts to feed a cat to an ATM).In the film's closing chaotic moments, events become very confusing, with a crazed Bateman finally revealing all to his lawyer over the phone; the very next day, however, we learn that the lawyer has not only taken Bateman's confession to be a sick joke, but also seems to believe him to be someone else entirely. At face value, this all seems terribly unlikely, but it does adhere nicely to the reoccurring theme of lack of individuality; it is also a deliberate ploy by director Mary Harron to allow her audience to come to their own conclusions about Bateman's predicament. Is he free to carry on killing or has all that we have witnessed only occurred in Bateman's unhinged mind? Hell, by the closing credits, we aren't even sure if Bateman is actually who he thinks he is.Usually, I don't like ambiguous endings that much, but in such a demented, twisted, schizophrenic movie, it seems like the only satisfactory way to finish.",American Psycho
12,dbdumonteil,John Cale imitates Herrmann.,4,6 September 2003,"I have always admired John Cale, as a former Velvet Underground member and as a solo artist.Here he gives us his Hermann act ,and much of the score recalls the strident brilliance of ""Psycho"" ,notably during the scene Bale joins the gay golden boy in the bathroom .Of course,it does not match Bernard Herrmann's magnum opus,but anyway who could surpass him?MINOR SPOILER As for the movie,it's a pretty disappointing menu:Bale overplays and we've already seen that,much better,with Jack Nicholson.His character is obnoxious ,a spoilt child (don't we learn he was born silver spoon in hand,his father owning the company for which he ""works""?).There's the obligatory coup de théâtre (à la ""the sixth sense"" or ""fight club"" ) :it's not what you thought it was .I begin to get tired of these ""unexpected"" endings.Dafoe,the beest actor of the movie is wasted  with his part of an almost colomboesque detective.",American Psycho
13,Quinoa1984,One of the Best films of the year,10,15 April 2000,"American Psycho is a terrific film.  I got a lot more than I expected from a horror film.  It turns out to be a satire about a narcasistic businessman who has a hobby for killing.  I wathced as Christian Bale gave his best performance yet, and I realized his vanity in the film was enough to be a psycho.  I guess the killings justify the means.  Still, the way I saw his life made me feel a little bit better because he is a maniac in a tie (what other killer would talk about Sting, Whitney Houston or Huey Louis and the News before ending their life-span).  Still, his antics are mesmerizing, entertaining, and sometimes even humorous (in a demented way).  One of the best of the year.  A++",American Psycho
14,wes-connors,Simply Irresistible,7,3 January 2010,"Impossibly vain and hot-bodied Christian Bale (as Patrick Bateman) enjoys looking good, eating in fine Manhattan-area restaurants, and blondes coming in pairs. His yuppie world is shattered when cute colleague Jared Leto (as Paul Allen) shows off a better business card, and an ability to score Friday evening reservations at ""Dorsia"". So, meanwhile, or coincidently, Mr. Bale's homicidal tendencies veer out of control. Previously, Bale killed a random night-time pick-up; now a rampant blood-lusting ""American Psycho"", Bale begins to kill almost anything that moves This bizarre satire on 1980s serial killers, musical tastes, and Reaganomics was based on a more gruesome (than even this ""Unrated Cut"" film) novel by Bret Easton Ellis. The level of gore aside, director Mary Harron's ""American Psycho"" is very different, in tone; and, that's entirely acceptable. It's stranger on film to see Bale getting away with so much mayhem - and his aim with a chainsaw is to die for - but, the film's flaw, in my opinion, is that the story ""twist"" (the questionable reality concerning Bateman's crimes) is not possible according to what you see on screen.Mainly, this is due to very strong performances by a couple of women in the cast. It's impossible, for example, to consider pining secretary Chloe Sevigny (as Jean) operating in the protagonist's psyche solely - this is painfully obvious when she sits at his desk, and looks through his doodles. The ""point-of-view"" is clearly off the mark. Prostitute Sara Seymour (as ""Christie"") is another registering such a strong characterization. These lovely, vulnerable performances are too hip for the room. Others in the cast operate in the killer's world. Bale's lead is excellent.******* American Psycho (1/21/00) Mary Harron ~ Christian Bale, Chloe Sevigny, Sara Seymour, Guinevere Turner",American Psycho
15,Coventry,Still crazy (and overrated) after all these years...,6,7 December 2020,"Up until a week ago, when someone asked my opinion on ""American Psycho"", I would tell them it was a boring and preposterous film. But that was mainly because I only saw it once, when it got released in 2000, and I was too young (or too dumb, or too eager to exclusively see violent carnage) to capture the true essence of Easton Ellis' novel/screenplay. Urgent time for a re-watch, I'd say! Twenty years later, ""American Psycho"" is still a bonkers film with over-the-top satire, excessive violence and an outrageous performance from Christian Bale. And yet, I still don't like it that much. Some sequences are brilliantly absurd, like when the egocentric yuppies practically orgasm over their own personalized business cards, but the majority of the film is just plain absurd; - period. Also, and be honest, who seriously cares about the frustrations of yuppie scum from the 80s? The film is at least ten years overdue. I read somewhere that Brett Easton Ellis envisioned a film version of his novel in the early nineties already, set immediately after the decade of the so-called ""young upwardly-mobile professionals"" of Wall Street. That would have made more sense, probably. Bale demonstrates that he's a fantastic actor, for sure. The film also features a long list of uber-talented supportive cast members (Dafoe, Witherspoon, Sevigny, Leto, Theroux, ...) but they are all quite redundant, since the plot exclusively revolves around Patrick Bateman. Brilliant soundtrack, too, but - again - overdue.",American Psycho

17,sunwarrior13,An Underrated Masterpiece,9,18 September 2012,"American Psycho is a cult psychological thriller and satirical film directed by Mary Harron based on Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the title. It stars Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Justin Theroux, Bill Sage, Chloë Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, and Samantha Mathis. The film focuses on Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman, whose mental instability and blood lust lead him to serial killing.Patrick Bateman, the son of a wealthy Wall Street financier, is pursuing his own lucrative career with his father's firm. Bateman is the prototypical yuppie, obsessed with success, fashion, and style. He is also a serial killer who murders, rapes, and mutilates both strangers and acquaintances without provocation or reason. Donald Kimble, a police detective, questions Bateman about the disappearance of Paul Allen, whom Patrick murdered several days earlier. As Kimble stays on Bateman's trail, Bateman's mask of studied, distant cool begins to fall apart. This satire cleverly equates materialism, narcissism, misogyny, and classicism with homicide, but you may laugh at the protagonist that you won't be able to hear yourself laughing with him.But nevertheless,Bale nails Bateman with a sublimely dead-eyed and deadpan performance.Also,it captures the 80's era when the events of this film happened.Overall,it is an underrated masterpiece.",American Psycho

19,Theo Robertson,Another Movie Trying To Be Too Clever,5,26 January 2005,"I'd heard a lot about the original novel though I'd never read it , possibly because it sounded like product placement with the anti hero giving long winded descriptions of what beauty products he uses and what designer suits he wears . This is translated into the start of the movie as Patrick Bateman washes , shaves , ex foliates and dresses in brand names . There's two problems with this , firstly that it holds up the main plot of a violent serial killer bumping people off and secondly it doesn't connect with people like me who didn't spend a massive fortune on expensive brand products in the 1980s Did you know this story was set in 1980s New York ? Oh yes you notice things like mobile phones the size of the brick , smoking in bars , and really crap music by Phil Collins and Huey Lewis And The News , but for much of the running time you totally forget what decade the story is set . Did anyone notice giant shoulder pads or hair like exotic plants ? , y'know fashion statements from the 80s some people don't like to talk about today . All these things seem to be missing as if director Mary Harron has only included 80s icons when the screenplay specifically referred to them . Watch WALL STREET just before you watch this and you'll instantly notice that one movie was obviously filmed during the 1980s while the other one obviously wasn't But the major problem with AP is that it tries far too hard to be clever . Despite the slow start once Patrick Bateman ( Played by Christian Bale doing a mean Jim Carrey impersonation ) starts bumping off people he doesn't like my attention was held except for a couple of details . When Bateman drags the body of Paul Allen through a busy concourse he leaves a trail of blood which nobody notices . That's detail number one while detail number two is when he chases the prostitute through his apartment block without again nobody noticing he kills her in an unlikely sequence by throwing the chainsaw over a flight of stairs . This got me thinking as to how no one notices his slaughter of innocents . I mean it's obvious the cops are onto him and yet no one notices the mounting death toll . Could it be that he's imagining it all ? By letting the cat out of the bag too soon with these two sequences from Mary Herron I was able to work out by the time he blows up a couple of NYPD patrol cars that Bateman's frustration in life is causing him to be deluded well before the final scenes . Did I say this movie was trying to be too clever ? Maybe I should say too confusing because it insinuates that Patrick Bateman is Paul Allen , or is a figment of Paul Allen's imagination . Duh. Whatever . Considering the very overrated FIGHT CLUB which came out round about the same time has a similar plot twist at the end AP's positives are dimmed even further by comparison Five out of ten",American Psycho

The book was bad to begin with...why try to film it?  The plot is thin and stretched out to 105 minutes and the point is made early on in the film...and then there's no where to go!  There was nothing well new or exciting in this film.  What kept it interesting was the direction and the acting.  Mary Harron is one a hell of a director--she gets inside her characters' heads and lets us know all about them visually.  The acting is superb--especially Bale.  He's playing a sociopath and a serial killer, but he makes you understand and (believe it or not) actually care for the guy!  Everybody else is great too, but Bale is just incredible.  So, good job all around, but there's no way this could ever be a good movie.  Still, it's worth seeing for the direction and acting.  Hopefully, this will bring bigger and better things for Bale.",American Psycho
21,LeonLouisRicci,The Undiagnosed Psychopaths,9,3 February 2013,"The modern fictional serial killer Patrick Bateman might easily have said..."" They will look back with interest and say that I gave birth to the 21st century"". This, of course, is a bastardization of the well known quote from real-life psycho Jack the Ripper. It is pertinent here because it was a brilliant concept of Novelist Ellis that the real blood-letters and psychopaths were not the usually profiled, although Patrick Bateman does say ""I'm a child of divorce, give me a break"".But that is a doubtful creation of the empty, soulless materialism and ""cremation of care"" mindset that befits and thus spawned these greedy Wall Street monsters. Witness the recent financial meltdown. If that isn't a reality based on the metaphor of the Novel and the Film, then you just don't get it. But the American people got it in the form of taxpayer bailouts, unemployment and a sluggish economy.The Movie is an artsy, slick, sombre, but ""playful and mysterious dish"" of dark humor, insanity, and the instability of the insatiable yuppie in-crowd. For these American Dream killers there is so much detachment that even the names of people that work closely together are interchanged and forgotten. It is to this point that our modern manifestation of ""success"" loses his grasp on reality and fails to know who or what is going on.The last third is purposely ambiguous and for that it has a necessary unsettling and unresolved feel. A sense that...even our President can be delusional while appearing to be in command...""A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.""

22,poolandrews,"""I think my mask of sanity is about to slip."" Didn't do much for me.",5,17 June 2007,"American Psycho is set in New York where Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) the Vice President of a Wall Street banking firm enjoys a hugely successful life with a beautiful apartment, loads of money, the best clothes, the finest food & all the luxuries anyone could ever want. However under the calm & calculating exterior Patrick has psychological problems as he has a violent blood-lust which he satisfies by killing people he has contempt for & he also likes perverted sex sessions with prostitutes (then again who wouldn't?). His latest victim Paul Allen (Jared Leto) is missed & his fiancé hires private detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) to find him, will Patrick be exposed as the homicidal maniac that he is or can he get away with it...This American Canadian co-production was co-written & directed by Mary Harron & I have to say that I didn't think that much of it despite it's reputation. The social satire laden script by Harron & Guinevere Turner who played Elisabeth the high class prostitute in the film was based on the controversial novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis & I just don't 'get' it's appeal or why anyone would particularly want to sit down & watch it, overall I think it's quite a dull & repetitive film with some nice dialogue & a few decent scenes which save it from total banality. Some of Bateman's monologues along with the amusing yet pointless speeches about the merits of 80's pop groups & the style of people's business cards are pretty funny at times if trivial & if your looking for some sex & nudity then American Psycho might do it for you. I was expecting more in the horror department if I'm honest, there's barely a drop of blood in it & certainly nothing graphic, pretty much all of the character's are very unlikeable & one dimensional with Willem Dafoe's cop getting about three scenes before he is completely dropped & I also thought it was boring with pretty much the same thing happening scene after scene. I wasn't impressed by the ambiguous ending either which tries to be clever but I just found it frustrating as it never clarifies if it was all in Bateman's imagination. Personally I didn't think it was anything to write home about but there does seem to be a lot of people out there who like it, so maybe I just went into it with the wrong expectations & quite simply it's just not for me.Director Harron does OK, there's a nice elegance to the way this is shot with nice camera slick moves. The film nails the whole 80's yuppie thing very well as these unlikeable people spend money like water, care for nothing or no one but themselves & have beautiful apartments for which I'm very jealous. I found myself becoming bored with all the yuppie satire going on & again it just felt very repetitive. I wouldn't say there's anything scary here or even particularly that violent although there are a couple of fairly strong sex scenes.With a supposed budget of about $8,000,000 this looks nice enough with sleek & stylish cinematography but what does that matter when the film did so little for me? Set in New York it was actually mostly filmed in Ontario in Canada. The acting is OK, I don't really know if I liked Christian Bale's performance or not. Willem Dafoe is utterly wasted in a nothing part.American Psycho is trying to be a complex dark thriller which wants to say something about 80's upper class society in New York, I'm sorry but weren't the 80's like 20 years ago? I'm sure there are many out there who like or even love this film & I'm proud to say right here & now that I'm not one of them, average at best & an irrelevant bore at worst. Followed by the straight-to-video American Psycho 2: All American Girl (2002) which has no connection to this at all apart from a vague Patrick Bateman reference.",American Psycho

25,Boba_Fett1138,"The fabulous, insane Patrick Bateman.",9,30 November 2010,"This is one very well done movie, that got greatly directed and acted out by its impressive cast.It's not really a movie that follows a clear main story but it instead gives us a view in the head of a young, successful and handsome guy, who seemingly has it all but behind his human mask actually is being an emotionless, murderous psychopath, who starts executing his weird fantasies during the nights. He more and more starts loosing it and looses both his grip on reality and the ability to keep himself and his urges under control. In all honesty, the best serial killer movies are all like this and instead of picking a real storyline it focuses more on the madness and its main character.It's a pleasantly directed movie, that picks a more light approach, rather than an heavy serious one and it takes us into the insane world and mind of the main character. The movie doesn't ever really become an odd or eccentric one but it still does a very good job at capturing the right mood and atmosphere.But it's also really definitely true that the movie and its characters work out due to the acting. Christian Bale is really perfect and quite amazing that this guy still hasn't been nominated for an Oscar, considering all of the great roles he has played over the last couple of years, this movie of course included. He's perfectly obsessive, cocky and charming and he was for a huge part responsible for me liking this movie as much as i did. But the movie also really has an impressive supporting cast list. It aren't really the names that are know by the big audience but it are names that are always respected and liked by the experts. Not to sound nit-picky but I wasn't as pleased with the casting of some of the female roles. Not because they're not great actors but more because of their very plain looks. The character of Bateman is supposed to be surrounded, admired and chased after by the most beautiful women and I'm sorry but most women in this movie just aren't that impressive looking. Perhaps it's due to the fact that this is a movie that got directed by a female, so she might not have had such an eye for it as a man would had. But this is about really the only thing that slightly bothered me about this movie, which should tell you something about how great it is.It's really a movie that I liked watching because of how beautifully insane it all got done.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",American Psycho
26,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Portrait of a serial killer,6,6 February 2004,"This movie is very strange. It's about a stock broker who's a serial killer at night. It's also about the social life of stock brokers, in the late 80's. The main character, Patrick Bateman, constantly excuses himself out of any situation that he doesn't completely control, and is, as all the other stock brokers in the movie, incredibly vain. He's cold and possesses no emotions at all. At the end of the movie, there is a weird twist, that turns everything that has happened up to that point around; apparently, none of it actually happened, and was all a part of Bateman's overactive psychotic imagination. On the other hand, maybe it isn't. There are a lot of different theories, but it all boils down to two possibilities; either everything happened, and no one cares, everyone is indifferent to the fact that the main character has killed an unbelievable amount of people, or none of it happened, but was just something that Bateman imagined, thought about, fantasized about. I can't decide which to believe, as there is evidence to support both theories. The movie is very weird; I've seen it four times, and I still don't really understand it. Whether it's because I'm too ignorant to understand it, or the fault lies on the director, for making it too strange, I don't know. 6/10",American Psycho

Filmmaker Mary Harron attempts the impossible: adapting, with co-scribe Turner, Bret Easton Ellis' controversial blood-drenched satirical 1991 novel with surprising success. Instead of relying on the ghastly acts as the focal point in diluting the gore factor (the audience must fill in the blanks for each act not unlike the original 'Psycho') she instead makes Patrick Bateman – Jack The Ripper in Armani - (Bale in a mesmerizing, darkly funny turn) a hypnotically scary 'merger and acquisitions' (or is that 'murder and executions'?)

Dare I compare him to 'A Clockwork Orange's Alex? Sure, he's just as maladjusted but not so much at blaming society, although the film does underscore throughout the absurdities of class warfare and contemporary thrillseeking (extreme sports being who has the better looking business card) forsaking identity, which is the key point here even if it means splitting a skull with an axe every now and then.

28,view_and_review,Some Information Missing,6,28 December 2020,"""Are we really in the head of a homicidal maniac?"" is what I was thinking while watching this movie. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) was fastidiously neat, religious about his morning cleaning and exercise routine, and very knowledgeable about his 80's music. The life he was leading-- working in downtown, making good money, going to lunch and dinner at chic places-- was all shallow and mundane. Emotionally he had nothing but rage and indifference. He was almost an invisible man. His fiance didn't listen to him, he was frequently called by the wrong name, and he moved about almost unnoticed. In other words, he had all the markers of a serial killer and serially kill he did. He moved about with frequent narrations to himself which kept us apprised on what he was thinking or feeling, yet it seemed as though something was missing. I think some crucial information was missing at the end which could've helped greatly with understanding --my understanding anyway.",American Psycho

He identifies himself through business cards while pulling away from humanity. He ignores his fiancé, disregards his secretary, and his apartment is strewn with bodies. Director Mary Harron is stylish particularly during a sequence where Bateman pursues a prostitute through corridors while hoisting a chainsaw. Confusing at times yet observant character study. Bale struggles to maintain his sanity as everyday life eludes him and grim images become a difficult battle of reality and fantasy until we are unsure his future. Willem Dafoe plays a cop investigating a disappearance and he hints too close to the facts during questioning.

30,Wuchakk,"The opposite of ""Deathwish""",6,7 October 2012,"""American Psycho"" (2000) didn't look like a promising film for me. On the surface, the plot is essentially the reverse of ""Deathwish."" In ""Deathwish"" a respectable citizen in New York City forsakes the law to secretly kill criminal scumbags in the name of justice; in ""American Psycho"" a scumbag in New York City masquerades as a respectable citizen while secretly murdering innocent people.I didn't think I'd like this film because the main character is, well, an American psycho (Christian Bale), which means it's impossible to care about him or root for him. In fact, pretty much the only people in the film that you might care about or root for are the psycho's secretary, Jean, and the detective (Willem Dafoe).So the film starts off with a strike against it, but then I found myself getting into the story, meaning I was entertained, and that's the name of the game in cinema.I also got the joke. ""American Psycho"" is not a serious horror movie or drama; it's a black comedy or satire. As such, it's impossible to take seriously and be scared; and there are quite a few amusing or laugh-out-loud scenes (like the head in the fridge).Thankfully, ""American Psycho"" has meaning beyond the surface. It's a commentary on the emptiness of America's materialistic, irreligious modern culture. Our innate moral compass has been lost with the passing of spiritual faith as we desperately search for meaning in secularism, materialism, pompous titles and the outward images of success, which generally leaves us looking good, but spiritually bereft. Life becomes virtually meaningless beyond the mechanics of the grind and everything that goes into it. People become mere objects to compete with or fulfill selfish desires. Etcetera. ***SPOILER ALERT*** And then the final act strongly hints that none of the murders are real; it's all in his mind and he's going deeper into insanity.***END SPOILER***I don't know if it's because of Bale's subsequent fame as the Batman or what, but ""American Psycho"" has become a popular cult film since its poor performance at the box office in 2000.This is a hard R-rated film, so stay away if you're not in the mood for heaps of violence, gore, nudity, sex and cussing.The runs 102 minutes and was shot in Toronto and New York City.GRADE: B- or C+",American Psycho
31,gradyharp,'Darkness very darkness is sectional' - Gertrude Stein,10,19 May 2012,"American PSYCHO, 12 years after its release as a film, retains its power as a very dark human comedy. Based on the popular Bret Easton Ellis novel and adapted for the screen by Guinevere Turner and director Mary Harron it has the effect on the surface of being a brutally disgusting horror story but if the viewer stops there the point of the tale is missed. This is a parody on human behavior pushed to extremes and one of the main reason if works so immensely well is the fine performance by Christian Bale as the title character.Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an obsessive compulsive, style driven, ego maniacal successful wealthy Wall Street figure, working for this father's company. The film wisely dwells on the manner in which Patrick starts every day - doing abdominal crunches and weight lifting (the resulting boy Bale built is stunning eye candy!), every lotion and potion he puts on his face to keep his youthful appearance, dressing in the most expensive clothes and concentrating on reservations in the most expensive and exclusive restaurants for lunches and dinners with his associates (Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage). Critical of even the appearance of the outfits and shoes of his secretary (Chloë Sevigny) and polished like a gleaming Tiffany diamond, he is as shallow as those around him in the 'look at me' 1980s. He is dating a would-be fiancée (Reese Witherspoon) but pays little attention to her. Instead, at night Patrick murders people: he picks up hookers, kills them and mutilates them, hiding them in plastic bags like so much discarded clothing. He also murders street people for no reason and then begins a killing spree that reveals how completely psychotic he is, pretending to be a person he has already killed (Josh Lucas). The only law enforcement person on the scene (Willem Dafoe) but so little that he can be overlooked.American PSYCHO is a film that packs a wallop and Christian Bale gives a bravura performance.

It's just exuberant, hilarious, gripping and spot-on. I'm very vocal in my dislike of Christian Bale's acting style - it feels way too old fashioned to me (if he had been acting in the '50s and '60s, he'd definitely be among the best actors of his time, but nowadays, it just comes off as ridiculously methody), but American Psycho is pitched as a cartoon, and he fits in well. Most of the set-pieces are tremendous, most notably his axe murder set to Huey Lewis' ""Hip to Be Square"". I love every time he goes into the super-long descriptions of the music and artists he's listening to. The problem is, after the climactic sequence, the film takes the kind of twist that was all too prominent between the late '90s and today. Suffice it to say, it's not much more interesting than, ""It was all just a dream"". It flops to the floor like a dead fish and then ends.

And this is one of my favorite things about this movie. The costuming, set dressing and locations all come together to create a believable high-end '80s world. There's genuine atmosphere here, especially with the steamy nighttime streets. It's remarkable because the movie was filmed in Toronto. They did an incredible job with the look of this movie.The other genius move is the casting of Christin Bale as Patrick Bateman. Hes become an accomplished actor in the last 15 years, without a doubt, but this is still my favorite performance. Bateman's such an empty shell, a societal poser spewing PR blurbs, and Bale infuses him with a manic energy, balancing it with the ever-slipping sanity. His environment is full of the self-absorbed yuppie culture (no one knows anybody else) and his psychosis beautifully satirizes the self-absorbed culture where status rules. There's so much more personality here than the character had on the page.But in the end, it's a terrific black comedy. The dialogue's chock-full of memorable one-liners (we're talking ""Lebowski"" levels here; even if you haven't see the movie, you've heard the quotes), the songs are great, and when all is said and done, it's just a thoroughly entertaining movie.9/10",American Psycho

Now with memory of both rather faded, another look. It is a hard film to 'like' as the events and characters all seem to be horrible. And I mean the obsession with getting reservations for crazy restaurants serving crazy foods covered with scribbled sauces. The obsession for clothes and even personal cards and the variations of colour and embossing. All this is terrible enough never mind the grim killings and the increasingly confusing happenings as we begin to doubt what is being presented to us. Is Bale being evasive or is there something else going on, or not going on, more to the point? On balance and with the benefit of distance from those mad Wall Street days, this takes on the air of a decent satire of the times, when human life itself seemed less important than some statement suit or signature dish. And then the are the drugs. In truth its a wonder with all the money sloshing around and all the drugs being consumed that more people didn't get really, really confused as to what was real and what wasn't.

Set in 1980's New York City you have Bale as wall street and power hungry yuppie Patrick Bateman who's at the top of his game he has a nice apartment, nice clothes, and plenty of lady friends. And also he's a pop culture quoting champ of the current times and 80's music. Yet behind it all deep down he's a psychopath who murders, it doesn't matter if it's strangers or people he knows. This really showed a side of a Ted Bundy type a good outward appearance, but a demon on the inside. Plus this film really captured the 80's scene well by the way it showed the hairstyles, clubs, drugs, and it was well evidenced as it played some of the better hit songs from the 1980's.

It was originally slated for circulation in 1990, but Random House pulled out of distribution, fearing backlash. It was later released as part of a Vintage Series, and quickly sold over 250,000 copies, becoming one of the most popular (and, to some, important) literary works of our time.In the movie, Welsh actor Christian Bale portrays Bateman gleefully tongue-in-cheek, whether it's confessing to manslaughter over the phone (""I just had to kill a lot of people!"") or dancing to Huey Lewis and the News' ""Fore"" album before hitting an associate over the head with an axe.Patrick is a troubled guy. On the surface, he appears to be normal - he's a Wall Street broker with a secretary, an expensive apartment suite, his own limo and a fancy business card. But on the inside, he's a monster - complete with an insatiable blood lust and lack of empathy for fellow human beings. (If he can indeed be classified as one.) As a film and a novel, ""American Psycho"" is an attack on the absurdities of the '80s yuppie era - sometimes the satire isn't very subtle, in fact it's often made very clear, but I liked it. Because the movie is so eccentric and over-the-top, and Bale is so loony and maniacal, the satire needs to be equally strong - and it is. Whether it's business men drooling over each other's fetishistic business cards or Patrick discussing the nuances of modern pop music before killing more victims, ""American Psycho"" hits strong and hard - this is a great, overwhelming cinematic and visual experience. It cannot be condemned for being unsubtle - it never was.The performances are wonderful. Bale is superb as Bateman, totally embodying the character. As a man bewildered by his environment, and wanting only desperately to fit in, Bateman listens to Genesis and ""Hip to Be Square""; finally we have proof that too much Phil Collins and Huey Lewis will turn you into the next Ed Gein.Perhaps some fans of the novel will dislike Bale's performance (at times, it almost seems comical, such as when he murders his coworker Paul Allen, played by Jared Leto). But I thought it was the perfect mix of introspection, self-hatred, outer-loathing, lust, conformity and schizophrenia. Bale manages to capture all of this perfectly, and by the end of the film, I could not imagine anyone else in the role.Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon all have co-starring roles, but at the end of the day it is Bale who really drives this film home - he's the reason it's worth seeing, and in part the reason it exceeds beyond the typical restraints of its genre.Since its release, many critics have accused ""American Psycho"" of being a watered-down version of the book, being both ""politically correct"" and ""lacking satire."" However, I don't recall the last time I saw a man beat a dog to death with the heel of his shoe in a mainstream motion picture. Or chase after a prostitute completely naked, wielding a bloodied chainsaw. Or hold a gun to a cat's head and threaten to feed it to an ATM machine.In fact, when ""American Psycho"" was previewed before the Motion Picture Association of America, they gave it an NC-17 rating - not for its violence, as one might expect, but rather for its threesome scene between Patrick and two prostitutes.Director Mary Harron cut footage from the film and finally managed to achieve an R-rating, but on a new ""Uncut Killer Collector's Edition"" DVD, you can see the film as it was intended to be seen - and it's a real fine treat. Now excuse me, I have to go return some videotapes.",American Psycho
41,Rainey-Dawn,Hated It With A Passion,1,15 November 2020,I'm usually a fan of comedy-horrors bu this film I couldn't stomach - hated it. It is nothing more than a lame sex film with bits of murder thrown in. I never laughed once - never heard a funny line. I'm sorry I like Christian Bale but this one is not my cup of tea.1/10,American Psycho
42,Red-Barracuda,Brilliant adaption of a very transgressive novel,10,16 January 2017,"I remember when the novel American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis was first released. It caused huge amounts of controversy on account of its scenes of extreme violence which were considered to be very misogynistic. So much so, that someone even worked out that an anagram of the author's name was 'to sell be nastier'! I ended up reading the book myself and it is true that the acts of violence get progressively more and more extreme and grim, they are disturbing for sure. But it was also equally true that this was a highly satirical work of the blackest comedy.The film version came along after quite a long genesis and naturally it got people wondering how such a book could possibly be made without being banned in almost every territory on Earth. As it turned out, the film version was a very clever interpretation of the novel which wisely understood that it could not possibly depict the violent excesses of the novel in their undiluted form but instead deftly finds ways to get around this. The ultimate result in my view is one of the few examples where the movie matches up to the novel.Set in the late 80's Manhattan the film centres on Patrick Bateman, who by day is a narcissistic Wall Street yuppie who is obsessed with success, fashion and expensive restaurants, and who by night is a serial killer. By focusing on this character the story is perfectly positioned to become a satire of 80's America and the greed and selfishness that is synonymous with certain subcultures of that era. Bale himself is emotionally sterile, he has lots of money, an expensive apartment and a beautiful fiancé but he is utterly shallow and devoid of taste. Some of the funniest scenes focus on these aspects of his character such as when he hilariously offers up his opinions on his favourite music, giving detailed, yet inane, analysis on the very mainstream 80's acts Phil Collins, Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis and the News. In another brilliant, telling scene Bateman and several of his peers compare business cards; as Bateman eyes each, practically identical, card you can sense his discomfort that his card might not be 'the best'. This scene is presented like it's a highly suspenseful revelation from a thriller and is played completely straight. That's what makes it so funny because it is negligible subjects such as the font of a business card that truly are the things of paramount importance in the world of Bateman and his cronies.It has to be said here that Christian Bale in the title role is nothing short of a revelation. It's one of my all-time favourite performances from any actor and it really showcases what a brilliant talent he is; he completely nails this character in a way that honestly feels like it could not have been improved by anyone else. Much credit also must go to director Mary Harron who has taken on a pretty challenging project in trying to adapt such a novel. There is no question in my mind that she has succeeded better than could ever have been expected. The film has to tone things down for sure but it still contains some pretty disturbing scenes nevertheless; but the focus is more squarely on the satirical elements of the story and those are explored very well indeed. In the final analysis, I would recommend both reading the book and watching the movie, as both are very high calibre examples of their type.",American Psycho
43,sddavis63,"What Was That, Anyway?",4,10 March 2001,"I don't know quite what to do with this movie. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a young, Wall Street powerbroker type who, in his spare time, enjoys critiquing albums, kinky sex and murder - and not necessarily in that order! Bale - the only actor in the movie of any significance - is actually rather good in the part, as he shows Bateman descending farther and farther into insanity, finally reaching out for help but not being able to find anyone who believes him. He goes a little overboard at times, but then again that's in keeping with the character.My basic problem with the movie was that I didn't think it ever decided where it wanted to go. It's publicized as a thriller, and as a thriller it's absolutely awful. I first thought that it might be a serious attempt to construct a psychological profile of a serial killer. Forget that. There's no serious attempt to do anything in this movie. It doesn't work too well as a straight thriller either, for one simple reason: there's nothing particularly frightening about it! It simply contains the normal slasher-type violence you would expect in this genre, and, of course, grotesquely mutilated bodies pop up in the most unexpected places - except that, because we've seen these types of movies before, we expect them to pop up! But, on the other hand, maybe this could be looked at as one of those ""thrillers"" that's so bad it's actually funny. (Or, maybe it's actually intended to be a black comedy. If so, it's not too bad.) And, at times, it really is funny! Let's just say that I spent far more time laughing than I did perched on the edge of my seat!Aside from Bale's performance (and I'm still not sure if he put on a great comedic performance or a lousy dramatic performance) the supporting cast was mediocre. Willem Dafoe had little to do in the role of Donald Kimball, a police detective who seems to be suspicious of Bateman as he investigates one of the murders, but then seems to do little to follow up on his suspicions except take Bateman out to lunch. The best performance of the weak supporting cast was probably that of Cara Seymour as the prostitute Christie, who becomes a participant in Bateman's kinky games.So, again, what to do with this? Maybe just forget it and ""return the video?"" (You have to have seen the movie to understand that reference.) Or maybe that's too harsh. I mean, it isn't terrible; it's just not very good. The combination of a lousy thriller and a not-so-bad comedy (and, I might add, that either way it falls apart with what I thought was a terribly weak ending) gives this a rating of 4/10.",American Psycho

45,ElMaruecan82,"The dark side of vain masculinity, unveiled by Mary Harron ...",8,9 March 2020,"I was 27 with high enough a salary to be a chain-dater, taking girls to the same expensive restaurants, especially one with the best panoramic view on Casablanca. My face became familiar to the waiters and they did a good job pretending it was my first ""visit"". I could bring girls regardless of any intentions to build a relationship; what mattered was the status. Two evenings could cost me a tenth of my salary but it was worth it. And that's the degree of vanity to which I could relate to Patrick Bateman, 26, embodying that point of a man's life where the more he eats, the hungrier he gets.""American Psycho"" is set in the 80s but things haven't changed much; in the 2010s, we could all have a nice girlfriend and yet keep on lusting on that sexy profile on Facebook. Maybe the late twenties is an age where the manly ego roars too loudly to listen to reason, maybe there are so many possibilities that we're more likely to make decisions lingering on fantasies rather than reality, moreover in a time where sex is trivialized by porn and violence by pop-culture, which ""American Psycho"" shows (as opposite of ""tells"").The film, adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's novel and directed by Mary Harron, is about that state of vanity driven to its more extreme and disturbing form. Here is Bateman's existential dilemma: should he surrender to the comfort of conformism at the risk of becoming a mediocrity (in his own terms) or acting free in the name of a supra-individuality that puts him above everyone else? The film is set during the Reagan-era and centers on arrogant yuppies who measure success by their capability to get the best tables, the most exotic meals and fulfill any kind of sexual fantasy. And Patrick Bateman is the most troubled of them: he's attractive, articulate but his moments of social adequacy are punctuated with anxiety driven by jealous rage.But the weirdest aspect is less in his behavior than the way it keeps getting unnoticed. It's very telling that the final line of the film is ""That confession meant nothing"". Many movies tend to use violence to make a specific comment against society, channeling ""Taxi Driver"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"" (there's even a scene that echoes Kubrick's film where Bateman confronts a homeless man) but in ""American Psycho"", violence says more about the perpetrator and the environment that can't perceive him as the degenerate man he is. It's not about the vanity of men who reached the top but the way they are seen as perfectly compatible with civilization although they're acting below animals, it's like a more cynical version of ""Being There"" with Peter Sellers.""American Psycho"" can also be regarded as an alternative to ""Fight Club"". In Fincher's film, men compensated the vacuity of their lives by uniting and draining their energy from their survival instinct, with a collective voice, and rejecting capitalism because it rejected humans in the first place. Harron's perspective shows men who exist individually, but whose existence are lead at the expenses of a social conscience, or any conception of love or family. It's all about consumption, competition, buying, eating, trading, a world where even women are treated like products whether prostitutes or strippers or disposable fiancées. These men didn't fight the system but embraced it, men being wolves to men.Patrick Bateman took it a bit too literally: anyone above him is a dead man, anyone who admires or loves his Alpha aura might get away, someone with no goal whatsoever, no philosophy of life, deserves to be killed. Destruction is what connects both ""Fight Club"" and ""American Psycho"" but if in the former, the mayhem was supposed to build a new order, the message was still contradicted by its homoerotic undertones and its constant gaze on Brad Pitt's beautiful abs. The film was tantalizing our voyeuristic tendencies. We get the same gaze on Bale, when he's taking a shower and narrates his cosmetic morning routine, but it's devoid of passion, it's cold and soulless and his naked body is often associated to scenes of horror that connects between the two worlds of fantasy: violence and nudity. It's just as if the real motive of the 'Fight Club' was to create a sense of belonging, to build a collective male body instead of restoring justice.Mary Harron deconstructs the myth of masculinity through the portrayal of many metrosexual men as self-important and gossipy as the Beverly Hills housewives. Bateman has everything: a steady and gratifying job, a huge apartment in New York, a beautiful fiancée (Reese Witherspoon) and yet he's devoured by a constant urge to destroy whatever can spoil this feeling of perfection, even someone whose business card looks better. The film blends toward horror and comedy with rather gruesome episodes, but there's never any attenuating circumstance, Bateman has no moral alibi. He was raised by pop-culture, Reagan, and considers killing something as casual as ordering a hamburger.It might be the extreme point from which we understand the inconceivable: why would someone who'd accept that thousands of people die from a transaction accept to be ethical? Why would someone who's at the top of the human pyramid, decides to have casual sex with an average Jane or accepts marital commitment? Why would he indulge to normal behavior? That's the point, the higher climb as a man and the looser will be your sense of moral, (look at the Weinstein or Epstein scandals) and maybe Bateman, whether he commits the actual crimes or dream of them, is the embodiment of both masculinity and capitalism dark side.And Bale's extraordinary performance is crucial because he never tries to make his character sympathetic when he confronts us to our potential for degeneracy and hypocrisy. ""American Psycho"" is an underrated 2000s film, oddly prophetic, revealing new depths at each viewing.",American Psycho
46,paul2001sw-1,American Why-co?,5,8 June 2003,"What keeps us from doing evil?  A capacity for empathy, hopefully, plus our subconscious belief (ingrained by, among other things, our habitual shortage of money) that you simply can't do anything you want.  As neither of these attitudes characterise the yuppie, the idea that such a person could become a psychopathic killer is quite a good one.  Nonetheless, ""American Psycho"", based on exactly this premise, is not really a successful film. 
There are two linked reasons for this.  Firstly, the idea that the yuppie is as inhuman as the murderer is introduced at the outset, a position so extreme there is no onward journey that can be made.  Secondly, the killer's actions are a response to his life in general, rather than to particular stimuli, hence there's no plot in the conventional sense.  Christian Bale does a good job playing a man with no soul, but there's nothing new to learn once the concept is grasped.  The emphasis on the 1980s settings also serves to dull the film's satirical intent, de-stressing its own relevance to us, today.Brett Easton Ellis can certainly write, but this is not a great adaptation of his famous book.  For a really disturbing and suspenseful look at the world of American business, try Neil La Bute's ""In the company of men"".",American Psycho
47,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A psychological and ambiguous piece that's as uncomfortable as it is satirical.,7,3 May 2018,"'American Psycho (2000)' is an interesting and unsettling film that is never as straightforward as it initially seems to be. It's almost frustrating in its determination to not provide answers in the way in which you expect it to, though this is ultimately one of its core strengths. It's often an uncomfortable experience, using its comedy more as a tool to make you squirm rather than laugh out loud. The 'funniest' stuff is actually the smart underlayer of satire that roots the picture in a knowing world of its own. The plastic smiles of self-important businessmen are there to be examined on a much deeper and slyer level than you'd perhaps expect, before they're carved off with a chainsaw, that is. The feature trusts its audience to not only form their own interpretation of the plot's events but to also understand that it isn't as superficial as it may perhaps seem, that it doesn't align itself with its psychopathic protagonist even if it never directly challenges his actions. It's quite bold, in a way. It's also anchored by a fantastic central performance from Bale, who puts everything he has into playing his utterly unlikable character. Ultimately, the thing is ambiguous, challenging, smart and self-assured. It's compelling and unsettling in almost equal measure. 7/10.",American Psycho
48,bowmanblue,Bale's finest hour,10,3 November 2014,"Yes, many enjoyed Christian Bale's (excellent) turn as Bruce Wayne in Nolan's Batman trilogy. However, there are few occasions where an actor shines so bright that it becomes impossible to see anyone else ever playing the role. In this case... yuppie, eighties serial killer 'Patrick Bateman.' 'American Psycho' started off life as a book (which I strongly recommend you read if you enjoyed the film) and sat around in filmic-limbo for years before it finally made its way to the big screen. The book was one of those titles where die-hard fans argued so hard that it was 'impossible' to make into a film that no studio dared go that extra mile and attempt it.Now, the end result is certainly different to the book. The book had numerous complex points and sub-plots which would have stretched the film out for hours. However, just because the film skips vast areas, doesn't mean it doesn't hit the nail on the head. What you're left with is a 'summarised' version of the film (and a very good one).Patrick Bateman is the titular 'American Psycho' who works on Wall Street in the eighties and leads a double life as a high-flying businessman and a complete nut-job who, by his own admission like to 'dissect women.' And he does just that.Feminists have given many labels to this film which indicate that it's misogynistic and demeaning to women. They may have a point here and there. Bateman (along with his cronies) regularly objectify women and are basically only after one thing (two in Bateman's case, as he also likes to murder his dates). However, we're never shown that this is some sort of example for men to adhere to. We only tolerate Bateman's madness because he entertains us. The only thing that equals his brutality is his charm (as, apparently, is a trait of many a convicted killer/psychopath) and he, like Bale who performs him, is a joy to watch.There isn't as much gore as you may expect (certainly the book is a million times more graphic) and much of the violence is left up to the viewers' imagination (what did he do with that coat hanger after all?), so gore-hounds beware – if you're just looking for the 'red stuff,' you may be left feeling short-changed.Fan of Bale will probably already have seen it. It's certainly a vehicle for him to keep on his C.V. It never claims to be nice and you're going to have to be into 'serial killer' type movies to get something out of it. Just – whatever you do – don't watch the sequel (or feed me a stray cat).",American Psycho

51,secondtake,The originality and craziness almost compensate for the awkwardness throughout,7,29 July 2012,"American Psycho (2000)This isn't quite a dark comedy, not a satire of psycho slasher movies, and not a straight up suspense crime flick, either. Or is it all these things?It might depend on your sense of humor. If you try to take it seriously, which you shouldn't (the first clue is in the credits when the dripping blood turns out to be a red sauce for a fancy meal), you'll end up mystified and unhappy. If you find this funny, if Christian Bale in this pre-Batman demanding role is really wry and comic for you, you'll love it. Most of the time. I was somewhere in the middle. Bale is playing a caricature--the overly rich and conceited playboy businessman in the Reagan 80s. But he plays too often the caricature directly rather than letting it come through the performance organically. Sometimes this is fine, or even great, but it puts a little strain on other scenes. (The women I know who saw it or have seen it don't think this matters so much because he's really hot, and really naked, in lots of it. And it's directed by a woman, Canadian Mary Harron who cut her teeth, not surprisingly, with the artsy ""Who Shot Andy Warhol."")The plot is important and clever, and hard to talk about because there are some key twists, the twists becoming really huge by the end. Appropriately. Because above all this is camp. It's hammy without being slapstick. It works best, in a weird example, with the recurring fascination with the business cards among this group of young pampered business jerks. Jealousies over the color of the paper and the quality of the type lead to, well, some unrestrained behavior.The movie is sometimes bloody for sure, but most of the blood is so gratuitous it isn't quite disturbing. The main character is insane as the title implies--more than you realize at first--and the people around him don't always see him for what he is. Or do they? Or do we?There are a lot of movie tricks here. Scenes shift reality, or echoes from one situation visually resemble another, and in that sense it's a smartly made. But it also manipulates too openly for anyone trying to actually enter the movie. And ""entering' the movie is a mistake. It's all show, and once you realize it's a farce and the characters don't really matter because they don't really exist (it's just a movie, the movie insists), once you realize that you're going to enjoy it more, but also realize it's a capped off experience. It only goes so far.By the end I wanted it to end. It's an odd, affected, curious, and almost period-defining movie.

I was judging American Psycho as a horror film. Which it certainly is NOT. It's about (as the film constantly says) a complete [loser]. He's no friends. Unable to communicate on any level with anyone of his superficial, yuppie colleagues (some of which don't even know his name), takes far, far too much pride in his appearance and has way, way to much love for his material possessions.

It's really only Huey Lewis and the News that prevents him from doing so.American Psycho is full scenes that are tough to watch. You'll be watching them through the gaps between your fingers. How can you not squirm as Patrick Bateman looks in the mirror smiling, flexing his muscles, while having sex with a call girl? Or taking the whole business card thing WAY too seriously? Other times the film is just laugh out loud hilarious. Bateman tells Willem Dafoe's detective he would love to help him with his case but he has a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable. Come on! Cliff Huxtable??? Or how about the scene in the Men's Room when Patrick attempts to strangle the gay guy?Don't watch this as a horror film. It's a comic, drama-tragedy. Patrick Bateman is a disaster waiting to happen. And his inability to stay connected to the world around him is a wicked delight. Though his world of slick, cocaine-snorting, superficial, Wall Street yuppies of 80s credibility is not really the thing anyone would want to be connected to. Maybe he's better off as a psycho with no pals.The DVD has a great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and a loud, well produced Dolby 5.1 soundtrack.

Save his greed and bloodlust, he is a robot.Harron tones down the violence to a lesser degree - although it is no less gruesome; the scene where Bateman, nude and bloody, chases a hooker with a chainsaw is an edge-of-the-seater - and emphasizes the story's taking place in the ""Me Decade"" with appropriate song and fashion that add to one's enjoyment of the film.Despite a lame ""Is Patrick really nutso?"" twist that hurts the movie, the point is not lost here, and Harron has a solid sophomore hit on her hands.Bale shines as Bateman, making us thank God the powers that be did not go with Leonardo DiCaprio as they at one point hoped to. Whether he's stiff, menacing, dryly sarcastic, tortured or over the edge psychotic, Bale is mesmerizing. If there's any justice in the world, Patrick Bateman will be a career maker.Too bad the supporting actors don't fare as well. With the exception of Matt Ross, who steals his scenes as a homosexual co-worker of Bateman's in a memorable bathroom confrontation, all other actors are window dressing. Witherspoon's role is written so blandly anybody could have played it, while Sevigny is incredible annoying as her characer moons over Patrick.

Wealthy, amazingly good-looking, powerful, cultured enough to make valuable points about the artists he likes and he's engaged with a rich and beautiful woman. There's only one thing on his way to achieve perfection: he kills people. Maybe that's what makes him feel complete within himself. But then again what's he doing with his life? Is he really doing the things he thinks he's doing?""American Psycho"" pulls plenty of tricks to convey its message on how thin the line between sanity and insanity really is, and there's so much to take into account that one does not fully understands the movie in just one view. It looks something simple to be solved but it's just the other way around. The more you see it the more you realize how shaky everything is, nothing and no one is reliable. Speaking of reliable, Bateman (played by a flawless Christian Bale) isn't much of a trusty character, but not in the sense he fools people, pretending to be nice to later murder them. It's more that he's so over the top in some of his actions and reactions that he's completely unbelievable, specially when things start to turn upside down for him, he doesn't get credit for his acts. But is he really there? No one seems to be listening to what's he saying. How much of Bateman's murders are real or just imagination or maybe fantasies of his twisted persona? If they're real what's the pleasure in killing people? There's madness, hysteria, ecstasy, laughs whenever he's slaying and brutalizing his victims, frequently preceded of long opinions on the musicians he listens to. But there's no true enjoyment afterwards. We can't see that on his face or some sense of gain in getting rid of his victims, merely people of whom he just needs to make them disappear, such as a business acquaintance he truly dislikes (played by Jared Leto) or a poor homeless. If he feels something we'll never know, he hides deep down inside.Bale is such a good actor for this part that comes as a shock to know that he wasn't the first choice for the role. Thankfully, many obstacles in the way of making it made it possible to him take this role which people said to him ""It will kill your career!"". It turns out to be not only one of his most notorious roles but also the one that reinvented him to Hollywood, a completely 180 degree turn up of his most recognizable role to that date as Jim in ""Empire of the Sun"". The character he plays here is vain, brutal, calculist, deeply impressed by the mass culture of the period he lives but completely apathetic and careless on the people of and out of his circle. He exteriorizes many expressions but down in the core we know he can't feel anything. That's why he does what he does (if he ever did). To make a relevant comparison, the performance of the actor and his character reminded of Eric Packer, played by Robert Pattinson in ""Cosmopolis"", one of the most debated films of the last years. Hard to reach a good consensus on it because his character resembles a lot Patrick Bateman but the performance of the actor leaves us confused, there's difference in the situations he lives and the one he faces through the whole journey. Of all the film adaptations based on Bret Easton Ellis novels this is truly the greatest one. Mary Harron made a hard effort in making this looks like the 1980's (""The Informers"" is so poor in this aspect), quite a nostalgic time travel in between musics and references, a truthful portrayal of the yuppie generation as never shown before in so many details, yet it reveals so much about every vain and blind generations that came after in the 1990's and the 2000's. Perhaps that's the reason why people identifies with this movie so much, even after years of its release. Harron also got it right with the casting - Willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas, Chlöe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Justin Theroux, Matt Ross, Guinevere Turner (who also wrote the script) all in positive performances. Disturbingly funny, the movie and its main character are powerfully iconic just as Alex DeLarge in ""A Clockwork Orange"", both easily misinterpreted by a vast majority of its viewers. Bateman's tirades are priceless whether discussing Huey Lewis & The News musical qualities before killing one of his victims or his repeated line about having to return some videotapes. Like he says ""he's just a happy camper!"" 10/10",American Psycho

I could tell that this performance of him it could be one of his best, and one of those would make us expect even more from him.""American Psycho"" has to do with a wealthy New York businessman who brings to the surface an another person, a psychopathic.

61,Dr_Coulardeau,What's cooking in the financial Hell's Kitchen,10,18 December 2020,"Watch that film a second or a third time and enjoy the impossible meaning of it. The character is brilliant, cruel, inhuman, vicious, and perverse. He is a metaphor for the financial world of today: those who have the power of money can do all they want, including killing anyone who has the only shortcoming of being there at hand when they shouldn't have been. Jealousy is the basic feeling and envy is the basic passion.At the same time, this character and the film are a metaphor for the illusion this financial world is. The illusion that the world is their property, though it is not. They are ranting and raving about it but the world goes on revolving on its axis and evolving into its own future that has nothing to do with what these finance people want or would like it to be. The world has its own history, and no one has the power to kill all those who do not fit, to reject them forever, and to negate thousands of years of multifarious human struggle for collective freedom and progress.This character, though he may have killed no one, is a criminal nevertheless because his mind is bent onto killing all those who do not accept his absolute domination. This character is a tyrant, a dictator, a perverted serial killer of the mind, and though he may not be using Weapons of Mass Destruction or even simple pistols and knives, he is using another Weapon of Mass Perversion: finance. With the power of finance, one can kill millions by starving them to death or locking them out of human progress, at least the human progress that money can bring which is a soulless material luxury and nothing else.The film brings us a question that we cannot answer: what can stop these financial killers and keep them under restraint and control? The film does not want to answer this question, and the book behind did not try to do it either. History will answer the question within a couple of decades if we are lucky or more if we do not have any luck at all, but history will eventually and relentlessly answer the question and bring these financial feudal barons under the law of human progress. I do not think the character is psychotic.In fact, he is completely schizophrenic and he cannot survive in this world if he is not. That is also a lesson that comes out of these images: one needs a personal life to survive and that personal life must not in any way be invaded by the financial circus. There is only one way out of this dilemma: to escape to the farthest and deepest desert in the world, which would mean suicide, or to join a human society in which money does not exist, which would mean going back to even before the Stone Age. Careful, you may have some nightmares after watching this film.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",American Psycho
62,Floated2,One of a Kind Thriller,7,19 July 2015,"American Psycho (2000) starring Christain Bale in one of his more prolific performances shows the true struggles are early greatness or his career. Bale portrays Patrick Bateman very well. He captures both the dashing confidence of Bateman's outer self and the nervous insecurity of the inner man. The wheels of Bateman's mind always seem to be turning, whether he's checking himself in the mirror or feeling stress about being found out.Although it doesn't appear some way or within the outer complex, the production design is also very good. Gideon Food, clothes, furnishings, even early-model cell phones, all have the aura of excess and indulgence about them that is called for in this movie. American Psycho can still to the modern day be recognized as a great piece of film making. As a rewatch 09/28/19' American Psycho remains a quality thriller.",American Psycho
63,filipemanuelneto,One of the best films in Christian Bale's career.,7,8 February 2017,"This film is based on a book I never read and talks about the life of Patrick Bateman, a successful New York stockbroker who lives for appearances because of his exacerbated materialism. He loves appearances, personified on his perfect face, on his business card, in his home and ostentatious way of life. However, he feels that something is missing, and that he can not be complete with just that. Then he begins to kill and maim all those he can (prostitutes, beggars, people he hates) in order to extricate the contempt he feels for others and feel a more intense emotion. Thus, this film becomes a huge criticism of the world of appearances in which we live, and in which a monster only needs to look beautiful and successful to be well accepted by our society. However, its such an implicit criticism that many people focus on the crimes and ignored the philosophical reflection around the character. Christian Bale was huge in the lead role, and his strong and impressive acting is undoubtedly one of the main reasons to watch this movie. He is definitely to be congratulated, having made in this film one of the strongest roles in his career. The rest of the cast gives the actor a strong foundation for him to grow and shine. In spite of all this, it is a hard-to-watch movie, with very crude and violent images of murders and mutilations. Some consideration is needed before watching, which includes taking all the minors out of the room.",American Psycho

Having a great job at the firm of Pierce and Pierce Mergers and Acquisitions with all the perks that goes along with it, including custom made business cards, Bateman's dark side soon take over as he ends up insane In him feeling that he's not quite up to the job.That's when a co-worker Paul Allen, Jared Leto, at the firm got the coveted Fisher Account that Bateman felt was to go to him. Getting Allen good and drunk at a local Wall Street watering hole Bateman invited him up to his pad where he ended up hacking the drunk Allen to pieces and dumping his body parts wrapped in garbage bags in a number of neighbor trash dumpsters. In him, for the time being, getting away with murder has Bateman soon go over the top in in his crime spree. That in him abusing and murdering a number of hookers as well as civilians and even police to prove his new found powers in getting away with his crimes.The fact is that Bateman is not what he thinks he is and it seems that he's living in some kind of fantasy world where nothing in it is what seems to be in real life. Not a likable person in the first place Bateman gets no support from those, fellow Masters of the Univers, he associates with who are in many ways as rotten and back-stabbing as he is.

68,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A dense and bizarre psychological thriller,7,29 September 2008,"Welcome to the mind of Patrick Bateman: Wall Street broker, fine diner, playboy, oh and serial killer extroadinare. Bateman claims only part of himself is based in humanity and similarly, only part of this film is based on reason or sanity.""American Psycho"" is easily one of the top five most deranged films of all time. Those with a taste for the bizarre and an interest in the abstraction of realism will find it great, those who prefer movies grounded in, well, something, will at the very least be amused by the perverse nature of the plot and Bateman's psychotic character.Christian Bale does some pretty great work with Bateman, giving us a very dissociative identity look to the clearly insane killer, showing him as very cold and crafty while also emotional and irrational. His character jumps all over the place and Bale really has the look and skills to play all those kinds of characters.I have to say that while I like Mary Harron's visual choices with the film, overall I don't know if we got deep enough into the meddle that is this plot and the cavernous mind of Bateman. The thin line between reality/imagination, sanity/insanity is very clear, but the social commentary is sort of overshadowed by the film's taste for the absurd. I definitely think there's richness, but there is a lot of thickness too.I suppose if you come at this film with a more abstract perspective than a desire to sort things out and make sense of them, you'll find more things to enjoy about the film other than Bateman's philosophical conversations about sellout recording artists while he indulges in one fantasy or another. It's strange, and while strange is good, strange also needs to be handled a bit more thoughtfully than in ""Psycho.""",American Psycho

70,Anonymous_Maxine,A dark look at the subconscious mind of the typical American male.,8,10 September 2002,"American Psycho seems to be concerned with what it is that Americans really think about, and puts forth a rather disturbing assertion. This movie reminds me of an old video I saw of Jim Carrey back when he was a stand-up comedian. I think this was even before his Saturday Night Live days. He was talking about how we all have these weird, violent urges many times a day, but luckily we all have that voice of reason in our heads that tells us not to act on these urges (`Ah-ah-ah, turning the car into oncoming traffic  is counterproductive!!'). Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman is a guy who has those normal urges, just like any normal American, but lacks the voice of reason. He acts on his urges, and basically becomes what any of us would become if we did the same thing. Sure, I'm kind of going out on a limb to say that any normal American would turn into the murderous monster that Patrick Bateman is, but there is definitely an element of truth to that. If everyone acted on their urges, the world would be a nightmarish place. The movie starts out by introducing Bateman as a typical young businessman in the tradition of the guys in Boiler Room. Completely obsessed with money, superficiality, a dizzying array of skin creams and ointments, reservations at the trendiest restaurants in town, the goofy names for the colors of his business cards, etc. You know, things that normal people don't care about. But of course, Patrick Bateman is not a normal guy. These are all things that reflect the heavy undercurrent of sexual symbolism. This film is packed with references to the insecurity of the typical male about his sexuality, and Bateman acts all of these things out in every way from the kind of business card that he has to the kinds of people that he kills and how he kills them. Not a pretty idea, but the film definitely has something to say. This is not just some frivolous exercise in sex and violence and murder and rape, the movie has a message to deliver and it knows how to get some attention.American Beauty had a million things to say, not the least of which had to do with modern American society's obsession with superficiality and skin-deep beauty. American Psycho has some similar things to say, most of them much darker than anything in American Beauty (which had some pretty dark stuff in it!), but not delivered in quite the same stunningly skilled and complex package. American Psycho is a masculine film about American males and directed by a woman, which is just as well because a male director may have been a little insecure about portraying a deeper level of male consciousness in such a brutally accurate manner.",American Psycho
71,videorama-759-859391,One man's self destruction of a tipped mind,8,11 December 2013,"American Psycho is not the film you expect it to be when judging it by it's cover. It's one psychologically jarring experience, a study of one man's struggle who must conform to fit in, and even then he doesn't get respect. Patrick Bateman is the psychologically disturbed, and successful executive who's mind has slowly tipped, into carrying cruel acts of murder on numerous people, strangers, workmates, etc. Though we are to question, whether it's fantasy or reality, the corrupt and sick thoughts, violently imagined images of an unbalanced mind. This is Bale's movie, 'his trying to keep his mind together, and not slipping into murderous urges moments', scary and totally believable, despite all the other good performances, from a great assemblage of actors. They fit the roles completely, although Witherspoon as Bale's fiancée, got on my nerves, overacting the s..t out of her, almost mirroring her real self, off screen I guess. I almost wanted to take an axe to her. Although we identity with Bale's character, and feel a smidgen sorry for him, we detest him, especially with me, being a dog lover. AP has class, and is entertaining as from the interaction of characters, but also on the grounds of being different. Yes... and it's bloody, the Jared Leto scene, with him being chopped up by axe at the murderous hand of Bateman, the standout one. It has humour, too, thanks to some of it's female cast, who really deliver (Sevingy and Mathias). In the end, AP, will have you pondering as to the fantasy and reality element of the film. The gaunt Dafoe adds spark, as a detective, probably, slightly envious of Bateman, who's investigating the disappearance of one of Bateman's colleague. I must say it before finishing tis review- Leto is one of the most impressive actors I've ever seen it for my life. I've heard the book's better, but honestly I wouldn't touch it with a nine foot pole. And if you're smart, you'd leave AP 2 where it belongs- on the video shelf.",American Psycho
72,Vartiainen,Psychotic charisma,7,13 June 2013,"A film everyone knows to at least exist. A film that is said to capture the ugly underbelly of modern society, of modern America. And, in a way, it does just that. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a horrible human being. He's man obsessed with style, fashion, appearances, pop culture, sex and looking good in front of the crowds, a flawed human being that we all want to be. We all want to be him because he's rich, successful, extremely good looking and sexually active. He's everything we are told to be and everything we want to be, in our darkest dreams.This is a brutally honest film. It's very direct, very straight to the point and it has a clear message: modern society is obsessed and its obsession is not productive. This single point is supported by a clear vision from the director, an amazing acting talent from Bale and a story that has no wasted motions, no wasted scenes. It's all a single, flawless trip through a flawed wasteland that is a modern day utopia.A lot has been written about the ending. Some say it's just perfect, some that it's hard to understand, some that it could have been better, some that it ruins the whole film and some that it's the single flaw in a perfect film. I tend to think that the whole film is about the aimlessness of modern day society, about the meaninglessness of living in a society this obsessed with appearances. So why shouldn't the ending be just as meaningless? Still, it's a pretty jarring ending that will alienate at least half of the viewers, which is never a good thing. It could have been better, in my opinion.This is a fascinating film. It's brutal, it's stylistic, it's honest, it's confusing, it's slick, it's jarring, it's an experience worth having.",American Psycho
73,Vartiainen,Look into a dark psyche,7,24 January 2020,"American Psycho, based on a novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis, is a story of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), an investment banker on the Wall Street, whose life revolves around a few things. Looking good, one-upping his coworkers and listening to music. Only, he does all of these things in the most destructive, psychotic and capitalistic way possible. The movie is nothing if not a look into the psyche of a seriously disturbed man, who also happens to stand in for the rottenness of modern society.Most of the good things in the film can be summed up in two words: Christian Bale. One of the defining roles of his career, and the man absolutely nails the outwardly pleasant high-lifer, who nonetheless has the eyes of a dead man. Whenever he smiles it sends shivers down your spine because even though it looks alright, there's something messed up behind it. And then there are those scenes where his inner psycho comes out to play. Freaky stuff.Not that the other aspect of film making are lacking. It's a well-shot, well-acted, well-made film all around. But it's really Bale's performance that elevates this above the crowd. Well, that and the themes explored, but there are other films that have dealt with similar issues equally well, if not better.A movie well worth a watch.

You have to stay on the ball and thinking throughout and that's not really what those kind of people like to be do. So I can see it losing a few fans there. Secondly for the people who do like to combine intelligence with gore, it may have taken the intelligence thing it has going a bit far, thus confusing people. No doubt there will be those people in the middle who it was just right for and that's great. But the question that must be asked is, is there a high enough percentage of those people? Personally, I was unsatisfied at the end. But it's the type of movie that if you took 5 people who'd just seen the movie, sat them down and asked them what they thought, they'd probably all give you a different opinion.

79,freemantle_uk,"A violence, surreal film",8,24 January 2010,"American Psycho was based on a successful novel, which led to being a film with a cult following. It is the most successful film of Mary Harron's career, and Christian Bale's first lead role as an adult actor.Patrick Bateman (Christain Bale), is a very rich, successful 27-year-old man working for a major Wall Street investment company. He lives in a nice apartment in the Big Apple, physically very fit, hansom, has a organized routine, and is completely insane. He lives the high live of an executive, fancy restaurants, beautiful women, recreational drugs, etc... There is an even darker side to his world, involving affairs, prostitution and of course very violence murder. His blood lust starts to increase and can't content himself. He murders tramps and prostitutes, he suffers from extreme anger and envy. He murders Paul Allen (Jared Leto), another successful young man: his disappearance is investigated Detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe). Patrick's mind starts to decline.This film is more surreal then I expected. It reminded very much of A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, both classics, but looking at the upper end of society, not the working class. It does show a man who mind does break down and his looking for an identity in a hollow world. It is a satire of the high-powered 80s New York. It has a strange dark humour in places that works.Of course this film has a great cast. This is the film that made Bale's adult career. He has a great performance as a psychopath and shows his talent. I particularly enjoyed the scene when he murders Paul Allen where he was like Jim Carrey. Jared Leto only has a small role but is good as he normally is. So was Cara Seymour as a prostitute who is brought into Patrick's corrupted world.Harron directs a very violence, but this isn't torture porn like Hostel or the Saw films. There is reason behind it, and she only shows what she has to. She shows that she has a competent hand behind the camera and a decent art-house director. She handles the mix between reality and fantasy, leaving the film to be very ambiguous.A decent watch.",American Psycho
80,strong-122-478885,How The American Psycho Became The American Schmuckhole,1,13 May 2014,"My-oh-my! What a winning team! Feminist writer/director Mary Harron (who's F-N clueless about hardcore horror) and schlep-actor Christian Bale (who's F-N clueless. Period) Wow! What a winning team! By putting these 2 mental-midgets together for the making of American Psycho it resulted in a potentially promising horror movie getting reduced to its absolute candy-assed worst. (Well, hey, what the hell did I expect?) Some years ago I had actually read Ellis's novel (this film is based upon that story). And, I'm tellin' ya, even though the book wasn't much to rave about, at least it did deliver a substantially horrific punch.But, as expected, director Harron didn't do the book even the slightest bit of justice with it her snivelling screen-play, nor with her half-assed direction.With Ellis's book the total focus of the story was on the graphically-detailed descriptions of mutilation and dismemberment. And, believe me, his story was downright hideous in its detail.But, on the other hand, under Harron's direction, this F-N clueless bimbo completely sanitized the story's gore to the point of almost eliminating it right out of the story. And, this, in my opinion, was a big no-no.Harron literally reduced the ghastly-cruel American Psycho character to the level of being an disinfected American Namby-Pamby boy. And, this really sucked, big-time.This film didn't come anywhere near to generating the same gruesome horror that the book did. And, it should have been right on par with it.And, speaking about gross miscasting. It certainly didn't help matters, at all, that Christian Bale was the one chosen to play the title character, Patrick Bateman.Ha! What a pathetic joke Bale was in his part. His performance (as usual) was totally forgettable. He was nothing but a big, dreary bore who, under Harron's incompetent direction, came across as being some sort of a dimwit stand-up comic whose high-point in the story came about when he gave himself a facial.(Spare me!) On top of the terrible dialogue, the shallow characters, and the endless scenes involving expensive dinners in chic restaurants (ho-hum!), this picture (much to my annoyance) turned into one, long commercial, blatantly selling its 1980s, pop music soundtrack.A good part of American Psycho's story was dominated by one tired, old pop song after another.

81,ebiros2,Best psycho killer movie,7,21 December 2005,"Of all the psycho killer movies I've seen, this one tops the list. The best part is the dead pan acting by Christian Bale who portrays Patrick Bateman. He acts like he's a normal person, but it's clear that he's ""not there"" and thinking about psychotic things that's coming into his mind every minute. On the surface he's a successful yuppie bachelor who has everything one can wish for - a good job, high pay, good social life, and a successful career. The scariness of this movie is the contrast of this good life to the total mess that's going on inside his head. In the end a detective comes around looking for him for suspicion of killing his friend Paul Allen. He makes excuse that he heard Paul Allen say he's going to London while he knows he killed him. But then another friend says he saw Paul Allen in London. At this point Bateman's mind is so messed up that it's not clear anymore if he actually killed a person, or just killed him in his fantasy, and the fact that police is after him is no longer an issue because his mind is already in a far worse place than any prison. Based on a novel by Bret Easton Ellis, American Psycho is a great story because the contrast between the yuppie career of Patrick Bateman and his craziness is so far apart. If anyone has a choice between becoming a psycho killer or a successful businessman, no one will choose the psycho killer. But in Bateman's case, his insanity is so strong that despite his good position, he can't help keep on killing. The story portrays the double sided character of Bateman well, and Christian Bale does a fantastic job playing the character. A movie worth seeing.",American Psycho
82,ackstasis,"""I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.""",7,29 November 2007,"I'd be lying if I didn't admit that Bret Easton Ellis' novel, ""American Psycho,"" completely sickened me. It's a fascinating dark satire, but mostly for all the wrong reasons, with chapters of indescribably graphic sexual content and violence. If Ellis was aiming to receive a strong emotional response with his novel, then he certainly succeeded. I most definitely didn't enjoy it  in fact, I felt so uncomfortably filthy that I could hardly get to sleep  but he certainly knows which buttons to push. Thus, it was with some trepidation that I approached Mary Harron's 2000 film adaptation, which starred an up-and-coming Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, a murderous psychopath who finds himself caught up in the rampant materialism of the 1980s and early 1990s. Thankfully, and I say this with the greatest relief imaginable, the intense violence of the novel was toned down considerably for its translation to the screen, and, despite some weak direction in various scenes, Christian Bale's performance is positively awesome.To look at him, you would never have guessed that Patrick Bateman was a disturbed serial killer. He is 27 years of age, handsome, intelligent, impeccably-stylish and holds a high-paying job at the respected Wall Street investment firm of Pierce & Pierce. He tries everything within his power to fit into society, but cannot suppress his distaste towards it, erupting into nightly sprees of blood-lust, during which he tortures and murders women and others who evoke his revulsion. Though we are not offered any concrete explanations for Bateman's psychosis, these acts of incredible violence appear to act as a distraction from the frustrating monotony of his 1980s yuppie lifestyle, and as a means of overcoming the intense feelings of inadequacy he harbours among his peers. Though Bateman candidly speaks of his horrific crimes on more than one occasion, the people around him are seemingly so absorbed in their chaotic, materialist lives that they hardly acknowledge his presence. In a stark indictment of American life, society is so busy comparing business cards, booking restaurant reservations, using recreational drugs and discussing fashion trivia that nobody even notices when one unhinged mad-man slaughters dozens of innocent people.Less than a decade ago, Christian Bale was pretty much an unknown, having starred in a few notable films {such as Steven Spielberg's 'Empire of the Sun (1987)'}, but nothing that would make him a household name. After a string of actors  Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio  showed a passing interest in the film's main role, the opportunity fell to Bale, who delivers an absolutely extraordinary performance, portraying the infamous Patrick Bateman as cool, calm and collected character on the surface. However, to the scenes of violence, he brings a frenzied intensity to the role that is both disturbing and darkly amusing. Bateman's cocky lectures on 1980s pop music, prior to each of his killing sprees, are delivered with relish. It's perhaps a good thing that the film's director, Mary Harron, was a female, otherwise much of 'American Psycho' might easily have been misconstrued as sexist. In actual fact, the film always stops short of glorifying its gruesome protagonist, following his exploits with obvious disapproval and repulsion.Now we come to the most fascinating question posed by the film: how much of what Bateman does may we accept as reality? In the novel, Bret Easton Ellis cleverly keeps the answer to this completely ambiguous, offering scattered hints that support each of the possibilities. In media interviews, director Mary Harron has stated that she had always intended for Bateman's murders to be completely real, though I think that this is where her direction was a bit weak; I'll wager that almost everybody who hasn't read the book finished the film with the belief that Bateman had imagined all the killings. The final scene, in which Harold Carnes (Stephen Bogaert) claims to have recently had dinner with one of Bateman's victims, Paul Allen (Jared Leto), was handled quite well, since we already know that, throughout the film, it is commonplace for characters to mistake each other for somebody else {indeed, at the start of that very conversation, Carnes refers to Bateman as ""Davis""}. The scene of which I am not quite so enthusiastic is Bateman's revisit to Paul Allen's residence, where he finds a perfectly-clean apartment and a real estate agent. In the novel, it was written in a way that made the reader wonder ""why has the real estate company covered up the horrific murders?"" In the film, we're left without any doubt that Bateman is delusional.",American Psycho
83,dee.reid,Serial killers in business attire,10,29 March 2007,"""American Psycho"" is a difficult film to review because one, it's never clear whether or not the events in the film are real, or are just a figment of Patrick Bateman's (Christian Bale) warped imagination. It's deliberately never stated and is something that is best left up to the viewer to decide. The Bret Easton Ellis novel from which this film is based, caused a stir upon its 1991 publishing, which satirized yuppie culture, Reaganomics-gone-amok, and crass materialism during the 1980s.As it would turn out, Bateman, a successful Wall Street investment banker, finally decides to give into an insatiable blood-lust that begins with the cold-blooded murder of a homeless man, followed by a colleague (Jared Leto), and an assortment of call girls and prostitutes. Why Bateman does these horrific things without provocation, purpose or explanation, is all part of the film's bizarre appeal and is not just for shock value.Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich in ""Scream"") rhetorically asked why did Hannibal Lecter eat people? Why did Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers slash up promiscuous teenagers in their respective film series? So why does Patrick Bateman butcher prostitutes in his apartment? Maybe because he's a pretty sick guy? Who knows. All this can be debated for hours on end in a criminal behavior class (for which I'm reviewing this as part of an assignment) about Bateman's motivations.Bateman does not fit the profile of any known serial murderer before him. He's educated, wealthy, respected by his co-workers, and has a well-preserved body to kill for (no pun intended). So why does he one night, out of the blue, decide to chop a guy's face in two with an ax? Nobody knows, but my theory is that he just does it for because he has an unquenchable blood-lust that he suddenly feels the impulse to give into. To the world at large, however, he retains his businessman persona. To his fiancée (Reese Witherspoon), he's an all right if not somewhat shallow guy to want to be engaged to. He's also very sensible: he's often the one to straighten out his colleagues when they make a**es of themselves in public by making racially insensitive remarks.""American Psycho"" takes a shockingly funny and horrific look at Bateman's twisted reality, all without the safety of a net. Director Mary Harron looks at the Wall Street world of male bravado, closet homosexuality, materialism, and masculinity without a single flinch. (Is there anything more blatantly homo-erotic than comparing the print on business cards?) When we look at this world, we wonder: Did the '80s really look like this? Did an insane Wall Street investment banker go on a naked rampage, chasing a hooker out of his apartment with a chainsaw?Perhaps they did (I was too young to remember), but Ellis certainly remembered, and caught considerable flak from it. That Bateman is able to wonder why his murder spree goes unpunished, why he can't inflict his inner pain onto an uncaring world and why a detective named Kimball (Willem Dafoe) doesn't think to ask him harder questions about his nocturnal activities, all escape him, and us. ""American Psycho"" is a confusing, funny, and oft-shocking expose of a world that is best forgotten in history, but will still be nonetheless fascinating to criminal justice and psychology majors until the end of time.10/10",American Psycho
84,meeza,Cut Classic!,10,6 November 2000,"I am being serious or should I say serial when i say that `American Psycho' will be one of the best films of the year. Oh my christ! I almost forgot- It also has one of the best acting performances of the year from Christian Bale. This dark, but yet, brilliant film is about an 80's yuppie who moonlights as a disturbed serial killer. Bale's star-breaking performance should ring bells to oscar voters when they decide the best actor nominees. Director Mary Harron's  unique style of craftsmanship was right-on. Also, you will not hear a more creative screenplay in a film this year  especially in the scenes when Bale's character is describing his version of 80's musicians societal insights as he is nonchalantly murdering and seducing his preys. The `hip to be square' scene is one of the best of the year- so spread the news. Hopefully, I have said enough to have `psyched' you up to go watch this flawless film. ***** Excellent",American Psycho
85,drqshadow-reviews,"One Part Chilling Character Piece, Two Parts Absurdly-Effective Black Comedy",8,10 March 2018,"Psychopathy in the super yuppie 1980s financial district, where a wolf in sheep's clothing runs rampant through the sea of fake grins and phony networking events. Christian Bale really made his name as a leading man in the role of Patrick Bateman, a move that looks bold and prescient in hindsight as many warned it would be career suicide. He's the motor behind this story, on-screen for basically the duration, and able to balance scenes of dark, black humor with later episodes that require him to come completely unhinged. The first hour is unspeakably funny, engulfing us in Bateman's daily ritual and knee-jerk lust for violence, in the masks he wears to pass muster and the hopelessly superficial assholes he hangs around with. It's absolutely loaded with classic scenes and quotable lines, like ""Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?"", ""Don't just stare at it, eat it"" and ""My god, it's even got a watermark"" and I could joyfully revisit any one of those snippets at the drop of a hat. Every time we start to think it's okay to cheer the serial killer, though, he pulls a blood-chilling stunt that makes us question our own judgment. As the film unfolds, he grows increasingly sloppy, desperately chasing the dragon until he's in so deep that there seems to be no escape. The climax is a big tonal swing, and though it flirts with the idea of a wild twist at the very end, a lot is left to the viewer and I don't think it completely arrives where it means to. Still, it's a relentlessly entertaining movie that toys with a broad range of emotions and gives us one of the decade's most memorable performances. I could watch this just about any time.",American Psycho
86,MBunge,Mesmerizing satire on the 1980s,8,8 September 2010,"American Psycho is a movie that casts the 1980s as a vacuous, amoral, materialistic, nihilistic, degrading and degraded era of American lifebut it tries not to be too judgmental about it. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) works at a major New York financial firm doing whatever it is well-dressed men do as such places. Bateman is utterly self-absorbed and obsessed with his appearance and is jealous of anyone more socially successful than he is. He's cheating on his fiancée and knows she's cheating on him. He hangs around with three businessman friends who only talk about getting high, getting lucky and getting into the trendiest New York hot spots. Oh, and Patrick Bateman is also an insane serial killer. Now, given that, you might expect American Psycho to be some sort of thriller where Patrick Bateman is the villain and we watch him systematically slaughter people in ironically appropriate ways until one of his intended victims or some cop finally put an end to him. This movie, however, is about as far from that as you can get. It's not a thriller. The killings are random and without any greater significance. There is no heroic victim, and Patrick Bateman isn't really a villain. This film is actually a social commentary, punctuated with moments of crazed violence and an ending that wants to leave you with more questions than answers. As social commentary it doesn't have a very dynamic plot and how much you enjoy it depends a great deal on whether you get the point it's trying to make and agree with it. But if you do both of those things, this is an almost hypnotically disturbing film that keeps you on edge until the very last moment. Christian Bale does a very fine job with an unusually difficult character to play. Patrick Bateman is all surface. There's no internal life or self-awareness to him. He also happens to be very evil. But he's the main character in this story and we see and hear and experience the world mostly through his point of view. It's hard to spend that much time with that intrinsically limited a character and not get sick and tired of them. Bale manages to hold your attention and emotional involvement all the way through, and not just through his inherent charisma. He lets you feel sorry for Bateman as a man who is desperate for satisfaction in his life but cannot achieve it and doesn't even really know what it would be. Bateman has no conscience but Bale makes you feel that he as an actor might have one, giving the audience something to connect with. The social commentary in American Psycho comes from our observing Bateman in his natural environment and noticing that the rich New York City crowd he runs with isn't that different from him. Indeed, the film forces you to wonder why they all aren't out butchering people left and right and suggests that Bateman is just more honest about what he is while the others never stop to think about it. I n a world of yuppie scum, the serial killer is the only one with any real spiritual integrity. This is a very well directed film. Haron crafts scenes of berserk violence with an almost dreamlike serenity. She not only makes us understand the social hierarchy and status competition that these financial sharks pour into their business cards, but she also makes us see how completely arbitrary and nonsensical it is at the same time. American Psycho does have one of those ""twist"" endings. You know, where the stuff you just spend and hour and 40 minutes watching turns out not to be what it appeared. But while many of those kind of endings ruin a film by making everything you see meaningless, American Psycho gets it right. Instead of just rendering everything before it invalid, this twist ending gives it all a different interpretation. What happened may not have happened but it still meant something. American Psycho is a movie with a sedate, intellectual veneer about a world where veneer is all that really exists. It wants you to think about thatbut it's not interested in telling you what to think. It asks you to substitute your judgment into the story and make of it what you will. So, if you're interested less is something that will entertain you and more in something will make you ponder, try this film.",American Psycho
87,Lechuguilla,Gleefully Subversive,9,12 September 2011,"Highly satirical in tone, ""American Psycho"" punches Wall Street in the gut, and does so better than any other film I have seen about that odious institution. The story, set in 1987, ostensibly focuses on a 27 year-old exec named Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), who works in a Manhattan high-rise, for a company in the corporate ""mergers and acquisitions"" industry. He hobnobs with the chic and trendy. And his personality fits right in with that crowd: amoral, shallow, deceitful, condescending, selfish, sneering, and slick. But in his off-hours he commits blatant acts of violence. Patrick Bateman is a psychotic Gordon Gekko.Yet, the script implies no back-story for Bateman or motivation for his antisocial behavior. Thinly veiled behind the obvious plot line is the film's subversive message. This Wall Street jerk is not a person so much as an analytical construct, an idea, representative of financial violence that lies beneath the veneer of material power and success that Wall Street prides itself on. Because Bateman exhibits overt physical violence, there's no way that viewers can look up to him as a role model like they can theoretically look up to Oliver Stone's Gekko. As such, ""American Psycho"" surpasses ""Wall Street"" (1987) in thematic potency.The dialogue even says as much. In voice-over, Bateman tells us: ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me."" And Patrick's ""confession"" at the end is the confession of modern Wall Street.The film's non-script technical quality is quite good. Cinematography, editing, costumes, prod design, art design, sound effects, and acting are all high quality. The semi-classical music in the opening credits provides clever irony. But I didn't care for the 1980s songs, though they are representative of that era.The humorous, tongue-in-cheek tone prevents the film from being perceived as a too heavy-handed cinematic lecture. Instead, the film infers ""black comedy"", adroitly mixing the usually discordant genres of horror with social commentary.In the Patrick Bateman character, ""American Psycho"" accurately describes the Wall Street mentality of the 1980s. That mentality has become blatantly more intense since then. As such, the film continues to be relevant and probably will remain so for a long time to come.",American Psycho
88,dwpollar,Dark comedy that is worthwhile...,6,13 April 2009,"1st watched 3/9/2009 – 6 out of 10 (Dir-Mary Harron): Dark comedy that is worthwhile but loses it's thunder in the last ½ hour due to the filmmakers turning us in strange directions. The film is basically about a 80's yuppie who has a secret obsession to kill while spouting off reviews of popular 80's music. Christian Bale is wonderful in the twisted role of a VP for a wall street firm who knows how to say all the right things and has the right acquaintances but can't stand it when one of his comrades has a better business card than his. This jeolousy and overly-perfect perspective leads him to kill those who he thinks deserves nothing and anyone who might get in the way of his own ego. He loses his ability to be cool around all this after a detective starts asking him questions about the disappearance of a colleague that he killed. At this point in the movie the dark comedy tries to take a direction towards whether or not Bale's character will make a mistake and be caught. This is where, in my opinion, the movie goes downhill. His ""don't care about anyone"" mentality is challenged but is never really taken anywhere. The way the movie ends also doesn't make sense and we're left with a good movie that could have been much better. The movie is unique in it's dry attempt to make fun of this yuppie generation and Bale's portrayal lifts the movie above mediocrity but the lack of a good conclusion lessons the films impact. Still, it's a movie to watch and enjoy for the most part.",American Psycho
89,noralee,"very funny, very visually appealing and horrific commentary on the '80's",7,12 December 2005,"Seeing ""American Psycho"" right after ""High Fidelity"" is like going through a fun-house mirror, as it's a warped, caustic view of many of the same issues ""HF"" deals with humorously and with humanity. The monologues on pop music are disarmingly similar, but here they are just foreplay for uncontrollable hate and blood lust as a way to try to poke through them for feeling, as if it's ripping through Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love"" video for blood.I have no idea about what the original book is like, but this is a ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" of the single '80's set. One weakness is that we don't actually see the interchangeable yuppies work so we don't see the testosterone rush at work that is so frightening in ""Boiler Room"" and would have added more tension and maybe even explanation here, where all we hear is that ""Mergers & Acquisitions"" is synonymous for the lead character to ""murders and executions."" They are all so interchangeable (shades of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" taking over Jude Law's character) that I was really not sure of what is real or fantasy when others keep saying that he must be mistaken about murdering a co-worker when they met with him.The lead character, played beautifully narcissistically by Christian Bale, is equally murdering men and women here, so the misogyny charges filed against the book don't apply here, and he's equally unfeeling to both. But as he breaks down, the irony is that he's not unfeeling about his crimes--the rest of the people around him are.It's a very funny, very visually appealing and horrific commentary.(originally written 4/15/2000)",American Psycho
90,davispittman,A delve into madness,7,3 September 2017,"American Psycho (2000) really is all about Christian Bale's descent into complete madness. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a very handsome 27 year old business man who has an extremely dark, sadistic side to him that nobody knows about. The plot revolves around Bateman and this dark side of himself, and what the horrible consequences are. One thing is for damn sure, this is not a flowery happy film, it's a dark film that isn't for everyone. It's a crime film but it also has some satire to it as well. There are other well known actors involved too. Justin Theroux, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, and Josh Lucas. Lucas and Theroux play Batemans jackass colleagues. They aren't deep characters, they're just kind of the stereotypical chauvinistic privileged jerks. The other characters in the movie aren't really focused on though, this is Bale's movie, it's all about him. I will say that Bale's performance is very good, it's skillful and I don't think anyone could have played it like he did. I think this is a good film, not an excellent one. I didn't really care the satirical aspect of the movie, didn't appeal to me. The main thing I enjoyed was Bale's acting. I suggest it if it's your kind of movie, but it's not highly suggested.

The story is well executed, and by far well written with a tight sense of atmosphere and direction that perfectly builds on suspense and tension in more interesting ways than one.

I had some theories, but it really took listening to others thoughts as well as those who have read the book for me to think I finally get everything. The synopsis is a wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), hides his alternative psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonist fantasies.As it states, we follow Patrick who we never actually see do any work. He is engaged to marry Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon), but he doesn't love her. He actually has no emotion, as he states himself. He admits to really just going through the motions of trying to be human, but aside from flesh, blood and looking that way, he doesn't feel emotion aside from disgust and greed.He has a close group of friends of Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux), who Bale believes is sleeping with his fiancé. They also hang out the most together, doing a lot of drinking and drugs. There's also Craig McDermott (Josh Lucas) as well as David Van Patten (Bill Sage). They all work together at the same firm. Another guy they work with is Luis Carruthers (Matt Ross). He is odd and he is engaged to marry Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). She is having an affair with Patrick though. This group of people goes out to eat all the time at fancy restaurants, drink and do drugs, living a rich lifestyle, but all of them are out of touch with reality. The four men who hang out together are sexist and definitely pretentious.Patrick tells us he's losing the mask of sanity. What doesn't help is his encounters with Paul Allen (Jared Leto). The first is that we get an odd measuring of ego by comparing business cards. Patrick then goes out to dinner with Paul, but he thinks that Patrick is actually someone else the whole time. It takes a dark turn when Patrick kills him with an ax.This brings him into contact with Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe), a detective who is looking into the disappearance of Paul. Patrick is becoming more and more unhinged and has less control over his actions. The issue becomes though, who is Patrick Bateman and are what we seeing real or just in the mind of a psychopath?As I've said now that I've seen this film a few times, I can see some interesting things that this film is addressing. The first is I've heard some people contend this is not a horror film. I most definitely feel that this falls into that category. We first have a psychopath that is on the edge of sanity that is going around killing people. Not all of this is done on screen, but it just has that dark feel about it. Seeing Patrick as he slips into madness is really something that is enjoyable.From here I want to shift to the interesting idea that all of these male characters are pretty much the same person. Of course, they're not. We can see that each one of them is different, but none of them really have an identity. This last viewing was in the theater with my girlfriend and she pointed out that they all look the same. They all want to do the same exact things and it is really just showing they are a stereotype of these people from the 1980's and really have no personal thing to set them apart.That moves to the point where since they're all so similar, no one can tell each other apart. Of course Patrick, Timothy, Craig and David all know each other, but Paul thinks that Patrick is someone else. Patrick talks to his lawyer at the end and thinks he's someone else and even thinks he went out to dinner with Paul. To take it farther, they're all sleeping with each other's fiancés and none of them seem to care about that either. They're just maintaining a lifestyle that they think they should. The final thing about them is that they're horribly pretentious as well as misogynistic.I want to shift to this to the acting and going to have just a paragraph here dedicated to Bale. His performance here is unreal. I like that he does so well at showing at first how much of a sociopath that Patrick is. It is a lot like watching the show Dexter that came out after this, in that they both know they're really just doing what they can to get by. Seeing Patrick as the more he kills, the more he loses control. But in the end, we don't know if what he's done actually happened or not. I'm going to have a spoiler section at the bottom as to what I think happens here.As for the rest of the acting, I think that Theroux, Lucas and Sage are all solid. They do well at pretty much mirroring each other which I dug. Chloë Sevigny has an interesting role as Jean, Patrick's secretary. She is attracted to him, which is fitting since she's into men who are available and just wants to be part of this world. Witherspoon and Mathias are also mirrors of each other which works. I have to a lot of credit to Dafoe, he's so good here. I love that his scenes were filmed with three different expressions of Kimball thinking Patrick didn't, thinking he's innocent and one of just not knowing, then just splicing them in to just make Patrick seem that unnerved when trying to read him. Ross, Leto and the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed.That will shift me to the pacing of this film, which I think is good. It has a run time of around 100 minutes and to be honest, it doesn't feel like it. We just move through this descent into madness as it gets worse and worse. Seeing that no one around him really knows him makes it that much worse. Much like his descent, his acts of violence get progressively more aggressive as well. I really dig the ending and the implications of everything that we get there. It is both terrifying and kind of sickening as well.The effects are really good. This isn't necessarily a gory film as a lot of what happens is off screen. What we do get though is blood that looks pretty real. We get to see some bodies, but only for a glimpse which works. The tension is built through seeing the build up and just how Patrick has no real touch with reality. It is shot very well to convey this also.The last thing to cover here would the soundtrack. I love that Patrick is a connoisseur of music from the era. It seems out of place with the things that he's into, but he has dissected it in such a way that it is surgical. How he describes these songs before he commits violent acts is wonderful in bringing not only horror, but dread as well. I think that the score fits for what they needed for sure.Now with that said, the more I see this film, the more I appreciate it. There's such a great character study of someone who seems to have it all, but has no touch with reality. Bale's acting in bringing Patrick to life is wonderful. He's accompanied by a solid cast as well. It is paced in a way where I don't find it boring and the ending is just great. The effects are really good, even though we necessarily don't get a lot. The soundtrack fits for what was needed. This is a film that really does benefit from multiple watches to really piece together everything that we are seeing here. This definitely a film I find to be great for sure. I would recommend to horror and non-horror fans alike to give this one a viewing for sure.My Rating: 10 out of 10SPOILERS:Now what do I think happened. I think that Patrick murdered Paul as well as some of the other girls that he brought home including Christie (Cara Seymour) as well as Elizabeth (Guinevere Turner). I do believe the homeless man we see early on was murdered as well. Kimball is coming around to investigate the murder. I think though that the rampage Patrick goes on late in the film isn't really happening. He thinks he kills all those people, but he's just panicking and ends up back at his office. What works in his favor is that no one really knows anyone else, so his lawyer really does think he's someone else much like Paul thought he was someone else. I do think there really are murders is when they're showing Paul's apartment, the lady there has a look of dread and tells him to leave. Since it is an expensive place, they're covering it up as well. Patrick is going to get away with it for now since no one really knows who he is, including himself.",American Psycho
102,Samiam3,Deadly movie,8,24 July 2009,"I have not read the novel, but I couldn't care less, American Psycho is a pretty sensational picture horror picture. The whole thing is seductive and weird, sexually twisted and extreme, but strangely intelligent. You can interpret this film many ways, but I guarantee you'll come away with something from watching one unstable man played brilliantly by Christian Bale, who is the most interesting fictional killer since Hannibal Lector. This is not a fun slice and dice picture, so do not go into this expecting a Friday the 13th or a Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Like Alfred Hitchcock's 'regular' Psycho, this is deep, thought provoking horror.",American Psycho

104,davidmvining,Nothing,8,28 April 2021,"""No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.""Well, I guess we're done here, then. There's nothing to talk about it seems since nothing in the movie means anything.I start with a poor attempt at a joke to highlight the difficulty of talking about this movie at all. It's easy enough to talk about the pitch-black humor centered around Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman and his murderous impulses, but what do you do with a main character that intentional eschews any attempt at meaning? Well, therein lies the ultimate point about pointlessness.Patrick Bateman is a yuppie in 1980s New York City who works in Mergers and Acquisitions for a large banking firm, but he never does a lick of work. Instead of working, he watches television in his office, doodles in his scheduling book, and has lunch. Inside his office he's a loaf who contributes nothing, but outside of it he's on a mad quest for status symbols. His apartment is expensive. Engaged to a woman he cares nothing for since he only cares about symbols, he has a regular affair with one of his friends' fiancée. He works hard to keep his skin healthy and his body in tip top shape. He wears the best suits, and he's particularly proud of his business cards.This is one of the most famous scenes in 90s independent film, Bateman comparing his new business card with those of the men he works with. It's an extremely funny scene as we watch Bateman steadily lose his composure in probably Christian Bale's finest acting moment. Each card he sees after his own makes his feel less impressive. They all essentially look the same with small differences in font, card stock, and coloring, but for a man obsessed with status symbols, those differences mean everything to him. By the end, in his mind, after being completely outshone by three others he can barely hold himself up. His efforts at status have failed.The other aspect of Bateman's personality is that he has a strong bloodlust. When he sees Paul Allen's card and how it trounces his, Bateman takes it personally. When Allen confuses him for someone else, Bateman takes the opportunity to get Allen drunk, take him back to his apartment, play some of Huey Lewis' music for him (with a lecture taken directly from a review he read since he couldn't analyze music on his own, most likely), and kill Allen with an axe.The rest of the movie is Bateman fending off a police lieutenant with questions about Allen's disappearance while settling into his bloodlust through both people he knows and those he doesn't, mostly women. He hires prostitutes and beats them. He takes his secretary out for a date and almost fires a nail gun into the back of her head, only stopping as she earnestly reveals herself and her desires for life (the only person in the whole movie to talk so openly and genuinely) and at the call of fiancée. He brings one of the prostitutes back to sleep with a female friend of his, and then he murders them both (the prostitute gets a chainsaw through the abdomen he throws down a stairwell and hits her perfectly with).This stuff is wildly uncomfortable with Bale giving an intense performance (pretty much his only acting gear), but it's also filled with that pitch-black comedy. It's funniest near the beginning, partially due to the shock factor of Bale looking so nice and acting so nastily, as the movie progresses it gets harder to take.However, the movie ends curiously. Bateman tries to confess his murders to his lawyer over the phone, leaving a message. When he sees the lawyer the next day, the lawyer calls him by the wrong name, insists that Patrick Bateman is too boring to do such things, and Paul Allen is alive and well. Did Patrick do anything? Were his actions just the daydreams of a bored executive who did nothing all day? Is he so completely confusable with his peers (like their nearly identical business cards) that he really could just get away with it all? Does all of this really mean nothing as Bateman says while a video of Reagan giving a speech about Iran-Contra plays in the background? This is obviously a comment on the 80s somehow, and the yuppie culture that developed. This could be a companion piece to The Wolf of Wall Street, about men who descended on New York to take part in the economic boom of the period but ended up contributing nothing, becoming amoral leeches neck deep in different kinds of decadence and depravity. Patrick Bateman is unconnected from anything but the desire to become the most of his group.Did any of it happen? It's not the central point of the film, but I actually lean towards no. Bateman is a delusional psychopath with no ability to affect anything. He's trapped in a world where he can only change the smallest of things that don't matter, like the font on his business card. He's angry at his inability to do anything and also still completely powerless.What makes the movie, though, is its sense of humor and outrageousness. Outrageousness alone gets old, but mixed with that black humor and it gains a certain shelf life where even decades after its release, American Psycho can still entertain.",American Psycho
105,Amyth47,I have to return some videotapes. (Or Netflix and...Kill?),9,24 December 2019,"My Rating : 9/10Christian Bale is PERFECT as Patrick Bateman.Set in the 1980s, the book follows the story of a 27-year-old Harvard graduate named Patrick Bateman, who goes on a killing spree and murders ""twenty, maybe forty people.""'American Psycho' is anything you want it to be; glossy and superficial, or deep and meaningful. The question is : Do you look at things from the same narrow angle as Patrick Bateman does? If so, then the movie is not for you...The film looks to examine our own distorted points of view or detachments from reality. Like Patrick Bateman, we may be trapped craving the approval of others and denying ourselves the ability to distinguish fantasies from our reality. People are obsessed with how the others perceive them likewise in American Psycho Bateman achieves no catharsis, he's trapped in his own personal hell because he requires the recognition of the other yuppies to confirm his identity as a murderer. The irony is that Bateman's real crimes may as well be fantasy. The lack of acknowledging his reality drives Bateman further into madness and existential despair. It's about yuppie culture, the melding of identity, and the craving to stand out from a superficial homogenized society.This is a great movie. Look for the subtext under the dialogue.Highest Recommendation.",American Psycho
106,RainDogJr,Psycho Groupie Cocaine Crazy,9,26 July 2008,"I have just crossed with this DVD; for me American Psycho was one of those films that you know about its existence and you know that probably will be for your taste but you never watch it. Of course now I'm glad I finally watched this film. Anyway, it has a character that goes to an extreme and that deliver amusing situations from a ""world"" where a presentation card is amazingly relevant for the satisfaction of a person. The film moves really fast so it is impossible not to be attached to it with its many unique situations: at a point is absolute unique and also hilarious to hear the words that Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) express about his favourite music with such seriousness. In this character Bale is simply terrific, probably his best work to date, and the support cast is full of familiar faces: Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Justin Theroux and Chloë Sevigny and all making great performances.In short, American Psycho is a very recommendable film and it is very easy to enjoy.

107,framptonhollis,Brilliant,9,14 December 2015,"""American Psycho"" is one of the absolute greatest films that I've seen recently. It includes almost all of my favorite things that can be included in a film. There's a good soundtrack, dark comedy, satire, disturbing dramatic elements, and some EXCELLENT performances.While I, of course, love the direction, script, dialogue, etc., Christian Bale's performance may be the absolute highlight of the film. At times, he's really hilarious (in a very odd way), and, at others, he is terrifying. There's some scenes that come across really chilling,solely because of his amazing and threatening performance. This is, without a doubt, the greatest Bale performance of all time. Sure, his performance as Batman is more popular, but, come on! Here, he manages to perfectly capture the film's tone using hilarity and horror, while with Batman he just makes that annoying, weird voice. Sure, Batman has to hide the fact that he's actually Bruce Wayne, but could you choose a better, less silly and over the top voice?All Batman rants aside, this is one truly excellent film that really impressed me on every possible level.",American Psycho
108,nycritic,Who is Patrick Bateman?,10,3 June 2007,"There is an interesting moment during an early part of Mary Harron's controversial black horror comedy American PSYCHO that truly defines who Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is, even when hints are dropped here and there that not even Bateman himself knows who he is. As he goes through his ritual of self-pampering in the name of 'taking care of himself' much in the way cosmetic ads tells us to do, he removes an exfoliating mask from his face in a surprisingly slow way, pausing midway, as he looks at his reflection in the mirror. The camera does not flinch. What we get, for a good five to ten seconds, is the reptilian glare of a monster, a man so repulsive, so unwatchable, that he would make an excellent place as a Stephen King villain -- the Dark Man himself.However, there is nothing 'dark' about Bateman. He lives in an ultra-swanky New York apartment, all white, an ode of minimalism at its finest. He dresses himself in the finest of fabrics (the book goes to extreme detail of describing just how much of a cult of the fashion-conscious Bateman and his peers are; indeed, all of them seem to dress and look the same and are often confused for one another), he works out obsessively, he admires how he looks, and he covets. Boy, he covets! It's only implied at first, but once the mention of getting that plum reservation at Dorsia -- the Newest Place to Dine At According to the Dining Bible That is Zagat Survey -- falls on the lap of a fellow co-worker, Paul Allen (Owen in the book), Batemen goes bonkers. Literally. (And that's not even going into how he reacts when he loses in the competition of who would have the best business card.) So. Paul Allen comes to his apartment to hang out and he winds out in the wrong end of Patrick Bateman's impossibly pristine, silver axe. The scene in itself is one of the most surreal, wickedly funny, and stomach churning I've ever seen. How Mary Harron constructs it: by having Bateman doing the moonwalk over a Huey Lewis song from 1987, ""Hip to be Square"" as he recited the importance about this song in pop culture while wearing a raincoat of sorts covering the length of his suit. It's disengaging, it's completely out of whack, but it's there, and it's neatly made movie history with its balls-out temerity and I love it. More so because a woman has directed it, and women aren't always given this chance to be this dark, this perverse.American PSYCHO is visceral, though it tones it down a tad from the book -- in Bret Easton Ellis' outrageous story Patrick does even more unspeakable things to ex-girlfriend Bethany and late in the novel, to a boy and even then it's still squeamishly funny, while impossibly de Sadean. Guinevere Turner maintains the novel's essence to its core, and by also adhering to the novel's ambiguity -- since we never truly know what exactly happened, what did not, and there is the question of who Patrick Bateman really is -- she creates a wicked examination of reality versus the surreal, integrity versus collapse, the American values versus complete decadence. Oscar Wilde would probably love this story, would he be alive now: this is his own ""Picture of Dorian Grey"" taken to its furthest limits.",American Psycho
109,raulfaust,Strangely odd,5,14 August 2011,"""American Psycho"" isn't a clichéd thriller involving a serial killer as always-- at least. This film has a weird story about a man obsessed with his body who kills lots of people, getting away with murder very strangely. For instance, there are cops and cops in front of him shooting him but they miss all the shots, while he just shoots twice or three times and the police cars explode out of nowhere. His name is Patrick Bateman and he proves to be a very annoying man, talking and talking about the most irritating things on earth. And Christian Bale isn't that good in this character; when he cried, I thought it was the character acting to fool people, but actually, it's the actor himself acting lame. Not to mention the irritating conversations about restaurants and reservations.The good thing about this film is the fact that it's oddly very entertaining; aside that, it shows no originality, surprise or strong performances, but spending 102 minutes in this isn't a total waste of time.",American Psycho

111,PredragReviews,"""I have to return some videotapes""",9,25 June 2016,"An adaptation of a novel of the same name, American Psycho stars an excellent Christian Bale as the strutting, Narcissistic corporate high-flyer Patrick Bateman (a nod to Norman Bates?), in a mind-numbingly artificial and greed-obsessed mid 80's. His colleagues and acquaintances (and, indeed, Patrick himself, as he admits in the beginning) are completely hollow, devoid of any emotion and concerned only with prestige enhancing finery like business cards and restaurant reservations. The film oozes eighties cool: the suits, the hair, the music, the clubs, the apartments, the dresses, the dinners and of course the money. Harron and Guinevere Turner's script is crisp, frightening and funny. Although the film is Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) brutal, they skilfully reared it in compared to the source material. The script's quality pulls you in so many conflicting directions: are we supposed to laugh or hide behind our popcorn? Is this happening or not? And the odd feeling of do we want Patrick to get caught or not? ""American Psycho"" gets pretty much everything right: music by John Cale will have you singing the pop songs days later; duel visuals by cinematographer Andrzej Sekula shows grim New York streets of the homeless, against the decadence of Wall Street, which keeps in harmony with the film's conflicting theme; Isis Mussenden's costume design is detail perfect, rather than hamming it up with Dallas-like shoulder pads, Mussenden clothes the cast with sophistication and taste; and let's not forget a career launching performance from the always great Bale as Patrick: that glazed stare, privileged accent, creaseless shirt and flawless physique says more about the character than hours of exposition ever could. Bale's performance is outstanding. He shows all the characteristics of a serial killer (obsessive neatness, ridiculous over-articulation and a pedantic hyper-analysis of everything from business cards to Phil Collins albums) but in an incredibly subtle and underplayed way, as befits someone who is trying to keep this in check. The supporting cast is also spectacular; Jared Leto plays an arrogant, ultimately doomed colleague, Chloe Sevigny is Bateman's shy secretary and the only one person who seems to 'get' him. Reese Witherspoon makes brief but brilliant appearances as his fiancé. Bateman's murder sprees are much more amusing than they are disturbing (watch out for him running around naked wielding a chainsaw) and provide a few good laughs, as does his obsession with looking good. Any movie that can have the killer taking time to exfoliate and make it work is a winner in my book! The story is highly original; I won't deny that I was completely lost in the last 5 minutes of the film but it's so entertaining I didn't even mind. This is a top quality film made even better by superb acting and directing.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",American Psycho

114,philip_vanderveken,"The story has its imperfections, but Bale made me forget about that",7,20 July 2005,"Of course I already had heard of this movie before, but it took me until today to finally give it a try. I knew that this was a movie about a serial killer and in my opinion there is no movie with such a subject that reaches the high standard that once has been set by ""The Silence of the Lambs"". But it was my brother who told me that I shouldn't hesitate. He's an absolute fan of this movie and he was convinced that I would like it too.During the day time Patrick Bateman appears to be a normal young man working on wall street at his father's company. But he has a dark secret. At night he turns into a homicidal maniac who likes to kill for fun. He doesn't really need a reason to murder, but it always helps when he is extremely envious of for instance his fellow co-workers. But he also murders out of pure hatred or complete insanity. Gradually his insanity increases, making him kill more than 20 people, ranging from models to homeless people, co-workers, friends, and anyone else who stands in his way. The only person that seems to be save for him is his secretary Jean, although she too almost becomes one of his victims. But is all this actually true, has it really all happened or is it just a product of his imagination, a psychotic delusion. No-one really knows, certainly not Patrick Bateman...I guess there are two ways of seeing this movie. You can either see it as a pure slasher movie full of gore or you can see it as a satirical thriller that tries to show how empty and shallow society can be. I prefer the second opinion, as it is clear to me that Patrick Bateman may well be a typical yuppie from the eighties, but still feels relevant today. Murders still happen and many people still don't seem to care all that much about it, as there are always enough people who will never be missed by anyone.In the end, this certainly isn't a perfect movie. There are just too many imperfections in the story for that. It's for instance a bit slow and sometimes you don't really have the feeling that the movie is telling anything that you haven't seen a few minutes earlier. But it's thanks to the wonderful performance of Christian Bale that I'm willing to forget about that. What he did with the role of Bateman can't really be improved by any other actor. He's absolutely stunning in his role and was by far the best actor in this movie, even though the others did a good job too. It's thanks to Bale's performance that I liked this movie and that's the reason why I give this movie a rating in between 7/10 and 7.5/10.",American Psycho
115,moviewizguy,Unrated Cut Review,8,18 August 2007,"Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated and intelligent. He is twenty-seven and living his own American dream. He works by day on Wall Street, earning a fortune to complement the one he was born with. At night he descends into madness, as he experiments with fear and violence.I was really in a ""not wanting to watch this movie"" mood, before watching this movie. I really was worried because I didn't know what to expect. Will it be really bloody and has a lot of violence? Well, surprisingly, the film is more or a dark comedy than a horror.The kills were not squeamish. Yeah, they were kind of violent, but not in a crude way. They were played like a satire so you really do not feel mad or disgusted by any content of this movie (expect maybe for some random sex scenes).What I didn't like about this film was the uneven pacing. Sometimes the movie passes really fast and sometimes it halts for a slow scene. It wasn't a huge deal, though. Christian Bale's performance is really different from what I've seen from other films of his. It may be in a good or bad way. I don't know. It was just plain weird.I'm a bit iffy with this film. It was decent and sometimes just plain horror fun. It wasn't anything spectacular and the pacing was uneven.

I don't mean this as an insult to 'Bret Easton Ellis' work, he simply had to use this intense attention to detail to deliver us the character of Bateman. So i for one was very pleased to find that this was carried over to film successfully (apart from the glaring omission of the violence and gore).Mary Harron, bravely chose to leave these scenes to suggestion, running the risk of reprisal from critics everywhere.Did Mary Harron chose correctly? I say absolutely yes! Given the relatively low budget of the film, the complexity of the story and the characters and the difficulty in displaying such harrowing and sick sexual and murderous visuals, 'American Psycho' could have quite easily become a very disjointed slasher movie, and thankfully it doesn't.Instead 'American Psycho' is a wonderfully satirical look at Yuppie life in the 80's, and the idea of living the dream at the expense of the soul. Christian Bale captures the character of Bateman with perfection, and he takes us on the decent into madness with him.Overall this is a faithful translation to the big screen, which is in many ways more entertaining than the book. My thanks to Mary Harron and Christian Bale for this achievement.8/10",American Psycho
118,DeeNine-2,The original Norman Bates was a pussycat,6,23 December 2006,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Relatively speaking, that is.This is an interesting, if a bit over the top, portrait of a psychopath gone bananas. Presented in white, white, and more white so that the red, red, red of the blood will be all the more contrasting, this approach coincides with the ultra, ultra sophistication of the Harvard and Yale grads working on Wall Street who are so, so very venal and superficial. This is a slasher film that will appeal equally to heartlanders on a date night, and to those blue coasters who need a little titillation.(And then suddenly Bateman takes over my review): Yeah, RIGHT. Who cares.Personally, I don't usually watch slasher films, being above that kind of stuff, but this is stylishly done--and I do like style in my blood splattering. Where director Mary Herron screws up is in not realizing that only an idiot sociopath would be so stupid and self-destructive as to so carelessly kill so many people. If there is one thing a sociopath never wants to do is to bring pain upon himself. Don't you think, considering the ending, that Bateman is going to be caught? Huh? (Resuming control of my review and droning on): ...although the terms ""sociopath"" and ""psychopath"" are often used interchangeably, there is a clear tendency for ""psychopath"" to be reserved for violent sociopaths. Another reason ""psychopath"" is correct is because this is a postmodern update of the classic Hitchcock slasher movie Psycho (1960) starring...(Again taking over): Shut up. Who cares who it starred? The point here is that this film--we're talking about MY film-- is a TOTALLY INACCURATE portrait of a true psycho--I mean sociopath. We don't make ourselves so vulnerable to the Criminal Justice System. We are NOT intent on self-destruction. Believe me if I ever decide to get my jollies by slashing someone up, I will make absolutely sure I can get away with it. Only low IQ psychos like Scott Peterson get caught. And, by the way, what is with this chainsaw business? I mean he tosses it down the stairwell so that it crashes on the floor from how many stories above, and it still works so he can use it on ""Christie""? Give me a break.Oh. You think that it hit her while still running, huh? Ha, ha, ha! Nice shot, dude.(Again resuming control): ..notice too that the ending allows for a sequel, yet has all the trappings of an ending. We know that he is going to be caught and yet...(Coming back out of the screen...): We know nothing. The cops are stupid. Nobody will believe...(Shoving him back in...): ...the emphasis on the conspicuous consumption of expensive food and wine, drugs, cigars, the indulgence of any kind of animal pleasure is, on one level a statement about our society--well, Wall Street society--but on another level is part of the usual Hollywood seduction of the audience. This is the fast lane. Wouldn't you like to live in the fast lane for a bit, but of course come back (after they run the credits) to your own way of life? Isn't this the essence of escape? Go to the movies, rent a DVD, kick up your feet and escape for awhile, and maybe there will be a catharsis, as the Greek tragedians intended. And when you turn off the set and go to bed you realize that nothing in your life is so extreme and nothing in your life is really that far gone, and yet you have experienced vicariously an extreme emotion, and as a bonus you can feel superior to those Ivy League sickos.In truth this is a slightly tongue in cheek slasher/serial killer flick. It's a satire of sorts. It is as slick as slick can be, thoroughly engrossing with fine acting from especially Christian Bale who plays Bateman. The direction is as tight as a well-strung banjo, the script nearly hypnotic in its seductive power, the New York ultra hip sets eye-widening as seeing the Taj Mahal while the sidebar-like satirical commentary, which (on a third level) parodies the genre, is very funny. Best joke: they're in the restroom of a fancy eating establishment and doing some lines and the guy in the next stall gets a little uptight because they're loud and screams out, ""Will you keep it down. I'm trying to do drugs!"" Also funny is how Bateman says what he really thinks and nobody takes him seriously, and how he slips up from time to time and nobody notices.Incidentally, Reese Witherspoon has a minor part as exactly the kind of clueless woman who might very well marry a psychopath. I liked this touch because I have known a few non-violent sociopaths and I often wondered if their spouses had a clue. Clearly Reese's character did not.Also excellent in support was Chloe Sevigny as Jean, Bateman's adoring (but also clueless) secretary. The idea here is that women are so bowled over by Bateman's alpha male credentials that they can't see the real person. The only character to really realize who Bateman was (and she ended up listening to that knowledge a little late) was the streetwalker. Well, Jean gets the picture finally as she peruses Bateman's graphic notebook. (By the way, somebody got paid to draw all the stuff in it. I wonder who that was. Was there a mention in the credits, something like, sick psycho doodlings by...?) Finally: real life irony. The character that Bale played in a movie immediately before this one was Jesus of Nazareth in a TV drama called Mary, Mother of Jesus (1999). As Casey Stengel used to say, you could look it up.",American Psycho
119,saadgkhan,An Open Ended Cult Classic,8,13 August 2012,"American Psycho– CATCH IT (A-) American Psycho is a cult phenomena and I have been hearing about this movie since its release but somehow never been able to watch it until now. The American Psycho revolves around a wealthy New York investment banking executive hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he escalates deeper into his illogical, gratuitous fantasies. American Psycho goes deep into the mind of human psychology and deals with the pressure of society to be perfect. The direction and writing of the movie is spectacular and it's brilliant to see that it's directed by a woman. That's why the all sexual and killing parts are more ecstatic than gross. Don't take me wrong defiantly killing someone with chainsaw is gross but it's not shot chainsaw massacre sort of gross. The movie is great till the final act where it leaves you tangling between what's real and what's not. Christian Bale is super as American Psycho caught between living perfect life and his darkest desires. There is sense of believe in everything he does and this whole attire, his physique was close to perfection. Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas and Jared Leto were good their parts but on the whole it was a one man show. American Psycho is a cult classic and if you like movies with open ending. Watch it!",American Psycho
120,sme_no_densetsu,Cutting 80's satire,8,24 September 2009,"Mary Harron's ""American Psycho"" is an adaptation of the infamous book by Bret Easton Ellis. As a film it's tough to categorize. It's part horror flick, part crime thriller, part drama and part satire. It's a bit of a tough sell since those interested in blood & guts aren't likely to grasp the film's thematic underpinnings while those interested in delving beneath the surface may be turned off by the film's violence.The meat of the flick lies in the script. A reading of the novel would probably improve comprehension for some but I've never read it and I understand it just fine. For all of its outward appearances as a slasher flick, the film is actually an astute commentary on conformity in the slick business world of the 1980's. The film employs touches of black humour while also functioning as a compelling thriller.The cast includes Christian Bale in one of his best performances to date. For me, this role, along with his part in ""Velvet Goldmine"" a couple of years earlier, made him a notable young actor in my eyes. The cast also includes some other noteworthy names like Chloë Sevigny, Jared Leto & Willem Dafoe. As I see it, the only weak link is Reese Witherspoon, who just strikes me as out of place.Mary Harron's direction fits the subject matter well. Much of the film has a sleek, polished look which fits Patrick Bateman's character to a tee. The film's score nicely complements the visuals and a handful of inspired soundtrack choices help to establish the film's satirical bent.In the end, ""American Psycho"" is definitely not a film for everyone. I recommend it if you're not particularly bothered by screen violence and you appreciate stories with depth and a satirical tone.",American Psycho
121,Howlin Wolf,The majority of those who complain probably haven't read the book...,8,12 April 2002,"... because with ""American Psycho"", Mary Harron and her screen writing partner have delivered the most faithful adaptation it would be possible to release without getting the film banned or revolting audiences so much that no one comes to see it. It would be IMPOSSIBLE to take some of the most extreme sequences from the book and commit them to film. What the movie instead does is to give us an insight into the stunningly fragile and insecure mind of Patrick Bateman, and to speculate whether his unstable nature would REALLY lead him to perpetrate vile acts, or whether he just fantasises about doing so.I think it matters little in the context of this film whether Bateman's exploits are actually based in reality, because whether they are or they aren't, Bateman is still left in the grip of paranoia, brought on by the shallowness of the society that is around him. Bateman is less of a 'psycho' than a vessel for all the selfish evils of society to corrupt, and a sensible audience is more likely to be left reeling at how he has been turned into a 'robot', than by the discreet amounts of gore that do feature in the movie.""American Psycho"" is fascinating to watch because Bateman is such a complex character. We feel revulsion at his violent tendencies, amused by his complete superficiality, and pity at his crumbling sanity. In order to evoke such diverse feelings from one performance, we need a superb actor. Bale's performance is right on the money. Never does HIS mask slip as does that of Patrick Bateman. He is completely believable in all his emotions.There is NOTHING in the film that is not true to the book (although there are bits in the book that are not true to the film) Both the reading and watching experiences are valuable and rewarding ones, but what they share with each other is that while they're exploring somebody else's mental state, they are also probing that of their audience. Can we see the funny side in the fact that these murders were committed for very trivial reasons?Can we ridicule someone with the knowledge that he is also a fantastically dangerous person? The film and book are constantly pushing boundaries, and if you don't fight that, but instead surrender to it, they will take you to many interesting places. Don't be afraid to give in to your emotions and laugh when you see something funny, because the movie shows us what emotional repression has done to someone like Patrick.Kudos to Mary Harron for tackling a seriously difficult project and turning it into one of the cleverest movies of recent years. ""American Psycho"" is anything you want it to be; glossy and superficial, or deep and meaningful. The question is: Do you look at things from the same narrow angle as Patrick Bateman does? If so, then the movie is not for you...",American Psycho
122,michaeltrivedi,Perfection,8,24 September 2019,"Could cinema get any better than this movie? Definitely one of my all time favorites, though I might be aging through it.The movie tells the story of a young investment banker with a seemingly perfect existence. However, to escape his mundane life, he turns to murdering innocent victims to get his fill and satisfy himself even more. From bums on the street to hookers, this man cannot get his fill of murder. And yet, society seems unaffected by his killings. Though it's obvious, no one ever thinks to suspect a thing. His life merely goes on, and no one would be any wiser.American Psycho is great filmmaking. It borders the line of horror, and tells you just what the upper class is capable of.8 Stars (Sorry for my poor review, but this movie is great!!!!!)",American Psycho
123,Screen_Blitz,Edgy black comedy is both entertaining and shocking,9,15 December 2015,"Mary Herron energizes Bret Easton Ellis's controversial novel with an intelligent script and powerful direction in this violent, thought-provoking black comedy that will leave audiences shocked to the core. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a wealthy Wall Street investor living in the luxury apartments of New York City. During the day, Bateman is hard-working employee at the Wall Street industry with a loving fiancée Eveyln Williams (played by Reese Witherspoon), but is secretly in love with another blondie named Jean (played by Chloe Sevigny). When his friends and co-workers do not is that Bateman is hiding a dark and fatal secret when, at night, he lives with a life as a sadistic serial killer; murdering his fellow mates one by one. As his vicious body count steadily rises, he soon becomes increasingly insane and finds himself questioning reality and those around him. Actor Jared Leto makes a fantastic appearance as one of Bateman's close friends, and William Dafoe plays a New York detective who is assigned the case of the murders that rise from Patrick Bateman's hostility. This is not your average serial killer flick. Instead of doing what most slasher-horror films do, centering on victims being slaughtered by one by one by a vicious psychopath, this revolves around the serial killer himself and how it murdering affects him psychologically. However, this film is not a horror film. Instead, it is a dark comedy that uses philosophical elements and some horror elements to create a chilling, thought-provoking story, and a captivating, but harrowing main character. Christian Bale takes on a risky role as the main character Patrick Bateman, a serial killer who sports a similar characteristic of Norman Bates from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. This vicious mentality is demonstrated in the scenes where he invites a friend over to his luxurious apartment, and treats them to classic 80s pops songs by artists like Phil Collins, Huey, Lewis, and Whitney Houston and gives them a smart talk about the before ending their life in a gruesome manner. In other scenes, and his dialogue in these scenes help portray the character's cruel sense of humor. Christian Bale is just fearless in this role, and his performance is stunning, probably one of the best performances he has given in his career. My only flaw with the film is the twist ending which is supposed to shock audiences, but only ends being more confusing than it needs to be.American Psycho is a pretty captivating film, and a worthy adaption of Bret Easton Ellis's novel. It is very spine-chilling, very funny, and quite thought-provoking. I only recommend this movie to viewers 17 and over due to the graphic violence and sexuality that is present throughout.",American Psycho
124,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,The queerest 'horror' movie I've ever seen.,7,27 January 2017,"**Extra Spoiler Warning** It's hard to describe American Psycho exactly... it's just as psychotic as the main character Patrick Bateman would have you believe. This film is an 80s nostalgia piece, a comedy-horror, a psychological film and the film that shot Christian Bale into Hollywood stardom pre-Batman Begins era. Bale's performance is great in this thing; he's a knockout, but it's unfortunate that the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Then again, maybe that's the whole point of the story.Adapting a book is hard. I never read the book American Psycho, but I can tell that a lot of the satirical nature of the book would have been incredibly difficult to capture on film. It does a nice satire of American capitalist life and we can sort of see why Bateman turns out the way he is. The thing that really sells this movie is Bale's performance as Bateman, which I think is probably one of the best performances in the last quarter-century of cinema. The story though? It's implied that it's all COMPLETELY in his head.I thought it was fun, but it was quite easily the weirdest film I've ever seen. I've seen quirky films before like Bran Nue Dae and Rock & Rule, and those films had simpler concepts to explore. American Psycho on the other hand is a story about a man trying to find his 'super-ego' in a world that he's grown sick and tired of. He f###s girls to Phil Collins music, kills a colleague while listening to Huey Lewis and The News' Hip to be Square; and he kills one of his female colleagues by DROPPING AN ACTIVE CHAINSAW down a staircase.If you want a film that is oddly colourful yet has the gruesomeness of slasher films, have characters look like they were ripped out of Dr Seuss stories whilst seeing its main character on killing sprees played to pop-music of the 80s, then this is the movie for you. Also, it is unusually funny, like humorous funny. I'm not kidding.This is probably what smoking LSD feels like for a serial killer.",American Psycho
125,dunmore_ego,Exotic Psychotic,7,25 April 2008,"About a yuppie serial killer who finds he is slowly going insane, not from killing people, but from the BOREDOM of doing so. This comedy is not just black - it's black with sprinkles on top and a human head on a spike.From the hilariously disturbing Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same name (screenstoried by Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner, directed by Harron), *American Psycho* defines a new angle on the internal world of serial killers. Our Hero is Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, ripped like a suspension bridge cable), a VP of his company, a 1980's uber-executive, whom we never see do any actual office work, narrating his obsessive-compulsive behaviors; petulant, trivial, rich, ensconced in yuppie consumerism; in a loveless, close-to-tears-of-exasperation relationship with his empty-skulled girlfriend (Reese Witherspoon), who is oblivious to his ambivalence and neuroses. He's also a serial killer. Bateman's life is an endless succession of vapidity  exec friends who speak and never listen, women who speak only as prelude to bonking, fake parties, fake emotions, plastic girlfriends, all status and wardrobe and petty gossip. Every time he needs to exit an unsavory social situation, his excuse ""I have to return some videotapes"" is taken without question because no one is listening; when he is loading a body bag into the back of a taxi, a fellow exec catches him, only to marvel at the excellent ""overnight bag"" It is no surprise that Bateman's only grasp on ""reality"" is the solid hack of his axe on someone's skull. When Bateman narrates an album review or describes pedantic rituals, his voice takes on the clinical detachment of an outside observer. And in that persona, his murders take place  observing himself as he is committing them. We feel the incongruous juxtaposition of personalities as he puts on a Whitney Houston CD and starts proselytizing on the philosophies of *The Greatest Love of All* as a prelude to killing two girls. And the black humor shines when he tells his secretary (Chloë Sevigny) during a date, ""You'd better go or I might hurt you,"" she thinking that he refers to the discomfort of office relationships, while he means it LITERALLY. Surprisingly, the two FEMALE film-makers retain verbatim Ellis' misogynistic Truth about women with ""good personalities,"" voiced at a Boys Sitdown by Josh Lucas: ""There are no girls with great personalities. A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard-body, who'll satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep her goddam mouth shut....""With all the *CSI*s and *Law and Order*s abounding on our inculcating airwaves, one gets the impression that most murders are eventually solved. But *American Psycho* leaves us with the reality that there must be thousands of unsolved murders perpetrated by people like Bateman  murders that we will never hear of because they are so graphic; that would never air on *Cops* for fear of making the steroid bull-stars of that show look as impotent as we know they are. Though a detective (Willem Dafoe) passively questions Bateman on suspected missing persons (that he has eighty-sixed), the reality is that if someone in Bateman's VP position WERE a serial killer, the kid gloves would stay on; were he indicted, the charges would be harder to stick; were he convicted, his sentence would be commuted. This is how a money-based society treats its moneyed criminals. It takes more brains, organization and creativity to be a serial killer than a cop. We are made privy to prosaic details when Bateman kills Paul Allen (Jared Leto); putting newspapers down to sop up the carnage when he chops him up, meticulously cleaning his fingerprints, packing a suitcase for the victim to make it look like he has gone on a trip, changing the message on the victim's answering machine, body bags, skulking skills, alibis, lying to the police so convincingly it's quite a task, and we almost admire Bateman for these forward-thinking skills, but then, maybe it's that same skill set that *all* vice presidents possess. We've always known you need to be pretty morally bankrupt yet a decisive mover-shaker, to attain executive corner offices. With its plastic, pastel-tie soundtrack (featuring Phil Collins, Huey Lewis, Robert Palmer, et al), *American Psycho* captures the era when cellphones were the size of cereal boxes, also conveying the ultra-upper-class hedonism and juvenility of these spoiled-riche business-boys (Bateman is vexed when a colleague's eggshell-colored business card is better than his; simply devastated when another colleague's card has a watermark); and reminds us of the blasé sexism once accepted in the office (""Don't wear that outfit again - and wear high heels"")  but the movie never quite captures the disturbing horror or unbridled carnage of the Ellis novel.Two reasons: Firstly, the book is the most violent story you will ever puke your guts out over - I especially remember the scene where Bateman grinds a circle saw into a woman's face and marvels at her teeth splattering outwards  and there's only so much disturbing gore the gutless, hypocritical MPAA will allow onto the screen at one sitting; secondly, the movie has been screenstoried and directed by women. Yes, it's a sexist comment  directly criticizing the fact that the female sex is trying to convey the male sex's point of view. And that can't be done  not by the most intelligent woman, not by transgenders, not even by Richard Simmons. Women cannot possibly fathom the sexual intent of *normal* red-blooded men, let alone the perverse sexual depravedness of a serial killer. How graphic, how ""sexually realistic,"" how authentic can the movie possibly be with these two hampering aspects? The most extreme this movie gets is showing a naked Bateman, covered in blood, chasing a hooker through his apartment complex with a roaring chainsawand we've all done *that* before",American Psycho
126,capkronos,"Toned down from the novel, but the satire is still intact.",7,7 May 2003,"Bret Easton Ellis' novel was thought to be unfilmable, but it's great someone tried, and pulled no punches about it. Sure, some of the more sick and tasteless scenes were omitted, but the tone and biting satire of the piece remains, and that is what's important.Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a 1980s Wall Street tycoon in NYC who has it all...and he KNOWS it--good looks, a nice body, loads of money, a penthouse apartment and a rich bitch fiancée (Reese Witherspoon). He's also a psycho suffering from the shallowness, prejudice and personal anonymity in his upscale lifestyle who can't control his homicidal tendencies.This film is initially an assault on yuppiedom and 1980s conservatism (with perfect music score by John Cale and appropriately sunny pop tunes), and although this doesn't necessarily have enough satiric stabs for a feature length movie, it's compulsively watchable nonetheless. In a world of platinum cards, Valentino suits, decadent nightclubs, A-list restaurants and exaggeratedly vapid characters, it's pretty outrageous seeing Bale (who's terrific) stab a bum (""Get a goddamn job!""), axe a coworker, aim a nail gun at the back of his meek secretaries head and, covered in blood, chasing a hooker down a hallway with a chainsaw. He also quotes Ed Gein, watches Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (and porn tapes), and listens to Ronald Reagan lie on national TV about Iran Contra.Like Harron's I SHOT ANDY WARHOL, the movie, no matter how out-there it gets, is grounded by the extremely passionate, uncompromising beliefs of the protagonist. Harron co-scripted with Guinevere Turner (who also appears as a victim). On a side note, the amusing raincoat/murder scene may have actually been borrowed from the film Hollywood CHAINSAW HOOKERS!",American Psycho
127,oneguyrambling,Worth a look if only for Bale's full-on performance.,5,8 June 2011,"American Psycho owes more to the 80s than the Wedding Singer, if it was set in the present day it would likely still see some acclaim due to Christian Bale's intense gonzo performance and achieve notoriety due to the scenes of sudden graphic violence, but it is the 80s setting that separates it from the pack.Christian Bale is Patrick Bateman, a handsome, privileged man with a great job (that he never seems to do), a beautiful fiancé played by Reese Witherspoon (whom he despises) and an immaculate home furnished with only the best and most stylish.Patrick spends hours in the home gym, on tanning beds and in the bathroom using a vast array of creams, gels and treatments that even metrosexuals might think ""too much"", he seems the perfect catch, an ideal employee and a great friend – aside from one thing oh all right heaps of things – he's the f*cking titular psycho after all! In this Gordon Gekko era America where Boy George is still deemed supercool everything is a p*ssing contest, colleagues aim to get the best tables at the most exclusive restaurants not for the food but the satisfaction of subtly letting the fact slip to others just for their expression, suggesting the wrong restaurant is perhaps worse than death. In most cases when they actually get to the restaurant their inner cynic won't allow them to enjoy the food anyway.My favourite line in the film is when someone says ""I'm not hungry but I'd like to have reservations someplace"", this pretty accurately describes the level most of the characters in American Psycho inhabit.Everything is like this, the desire for more and better is everywhere: the hottest partner, the nicest apartment in the best spot with the best view, even new business cards that seem exactly the same as the ones next to them are thrown down like gauntlets to be scrutinized and rated with envy and embarrassment – especially if one made the mistake of choosing the off-white over the ivory-white! Each conversation is full of similar one-upmanship, vacuous banal bragging and specious empty statements. At one point Patrick keeps his dinner companions transfixed with line after pandering line about world peace and fairness to others, and far from the eye-rolling treatment that he would rightfully deserve he is congratulated for his obviousness.Each day is eight or nine hours of sitting in an office not working followed by the inevitable dilemma of where to go to be seen.Unfortunately aside from being a fairly superficial human being Patrick also battles inner demons, demons that sit on each shoulder and suggest that he do horrible things to random people, things involving axes, chainsaws, agony and dismemberment.Patrick constantly battles these voices though he fears is fighting a losing battle as his rising hatred and disgust at the state of society requires some form of action. He attempts to keep a grip even though at times it seems the only reasonable course of action is terrible violence and the slaughter of those beneath him. Given the fact that no-one seems to actually pay attention to others at times Patrick casually describes his homicidal thoughts and acts, but these horrific words fall on deaf ears tacked on to vacant heads.Eventually Naughty Patrick starts winning the battle for booking Patrick's day to day activities, something ""normal"" society should be wary of. Let's just say if Patrick starts expounding on the merits of a particular musician or band – just run for the door.The film doesn't have an extremely high body count but some of the visuals are very graphic and shown in some detail. The elaborate façade that Patrick has created once a colleague goes missing and the investigation lead by Detective Donald Kimble (Willem Dafoe) repeatedly circles back to him. The stress Patrick feels in these casual questionings is palpable, as is the sweat that almost immediately forms on his brow as he searches for an excuse to close the Q&A session. It seems the only sane and grounded person around Patrick is his wide eyed and perhaps a little naïve personal assistant Jean (Chloe Sevigny), and eventually Patrick decides to throw her a bone and ask her out for dinner To say more would be unfair, American Psycho isn't so much a horror film as it is a statement of how society has started drowning in its own apathy – at least according to the film – the film sees Patrick take whatever actions necessary to maintain his tenuous connection with sanity and release his frustrations. When a situation gets too stressful for him his go-to exit line is always the same ""I have got to return some videotapes.I found it odd that this film was directed by a woman, given that in general women are treated as mere objects of conquest or lust – when the credits rolled 90% of women aren't even granted last names – I'd think about it more but I need to return some videotapes Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. A film defined by the 80s, I found the ending to be disappointing, but in reality the film itself only sporadically held my interest. Worth a look if only for Bale's full-on performance.",American Psycho

Though the movie released some 10 years back but I got the opportunity to watch it now thanks to growing popularity of Christian Bale. I kept on hearing about the movie turning him into a popular star even before The Machinist and Batman Begin and I was not surprised a bit. The actor gets into the character of Patrick Bateman so effortlessly that it is difficult to identify any other actor playing that part. He is horrifying as a serial killer , he is masculine and handsome as a playboy flirting with women , he is innocent when he confesses to himself doing wrong stuff. It is the character that you feel weird , funny, angry and yet sympathizing for his mental illness. The climax is something similar to Inception where the director questions the audience that what is the conclusion. Direction is crunchy adding taste to the film every time new scene turns up. The movie has some disturbing scenes like where Bateman stabs the beggar and kills his dog by stamping on it , the scene where he narrates the feelings coming out of Phil Collin's song while two prostitutes are lying over each other and making out etc. This is certainly not for the weak-hearted audience. Screenplay is engaging , art direction is good along with superb dialogues. Christian Bale is the show-stopper. I have become a fan of this great actor after the movie.

On reflection, I've realised that it's a very successful mix of all three. It made me laugh, it creeped me out, and it has enough violence and gore to rival most horror movies.It's also an excellent character study that gives us an insight into the mind and thoughts of a psychopath.

135,film-critic,You're so vain. You probably think this film is about you.,10,26 March 2007,"Who is Patrick Bateman? A valid question for those reading this review. One must wonder if he is the socially elite of the New York business world, the prime example of an obsessive compulsive, or the face of evil itself with an endless expense account and an unquenched need to kill  kill  and kill again. Just like the illusive Tootsie-Roll Pop, the world may never know. Bret Easton Ellis penned him, director Mary Harron gave him the paved road, while Christian Bale gave us the face, the mannerisms, and the world of the unknown Bateman. For those unfamiliar, Bateman is a new sort of serial killer. Not quite the BTK or Bundy, but the terror certainly ranges from within. Living in a posh apartment, eating at the fanciest of restaurants, and enjoying all the pleasures of 1980s New York, Bateman struggles with himself and the need to kill time and time again. His victims, mostly prostitutes and business cohorts, suffer the worst (far worse in the book) punishments alive either from ax, nail gun, hanger, or the ever popular chainsaw. Pulling from pop culture, dark obsessions, and eerily our own desires, Bateman shows no conscious, no compassion, no rational thought for these crimes, he just kills and kills and kills.Where this film takes a different element than you a-typical slasher film or horror genre is that midway through you begin to question the sanity of our anti-hero. Events transpire that catch both Bateman as well as the viewers off-guard. The biggest question is Paul Allen. The phenomenally understated Jared Leto delivers a mirror performance to Bale's as another suit in the business world. Due to accounts and business cards, Bateman dissolves the friendship  yet, everyone continues to see Allen walking the streets and having lunch with him. Even the detective hired for the case, one Donald Kimball (played by Willem Dafoe) seems to prove otherwise. Yet, something nags at our belief. This is only confirmed with an ending that will make you stop, rewind, and watch again. Questing everything from the mouth of Bateman, as well as his surroundings. Slasher film? Um, this reviewer would rather place it into the genre of self-discovery. There was a film entitled ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" that attempts to understand the meaning of life, but for me, ""American Psycho"" can do it like no other.For anyone looking for that film that contains an amazing score, an ensemble of known actors giving us performances of a lifetime, and direction that both mimics and mocks the lifestyle in New York during the 80s  than ""American Psycho"" is the film for you. For me, I don't understand why it isn't further a staple of the film community. Christian Bale could not have been a better choice for the face of Bateman, his ability to transform himself into the character was outstanding. His character wasn't over the top, nor was it Bale being a character  he was Patrick Bateman. What is it with Bale  there hasn't been one underscored performance yet. ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"", ""Velvet Goldmine"", and the ""Machinist"" are all within my top films of all time. ""American Psycho"" ranks above them all. Scenes, for me, that stand out are (2) major ones. The first, which proves that Mary Harron was the perfect choice to direct and that her decision to cast Jared Leto was directly on target is the scene with Leto and Bale as he prepares the ax and explains the lyrical juxtaposition of Huey Lewis. The language, the motions, and the choreography of the scene remains in my eyes, one of the strongest in cinema history. The second scene, while less cinematically inclined, is that of Bale running naked through the halls of his apartment, dawning only his tennis shoes (naked to the bone), with chain a-blazin' as he chases one of the escaping prostitutes. Again, maybe not the best in history, but a scene that constantly makes me laugh, shiver in terror, and remain in awe of the skill known as Christian Bale.I would go so far as to say that this is a flawless film, though I must admit, the only issue that I have trouble with is the ever lacking bonus features on this disc. I have the original version released and it only has a handful of extras which are not anything to overly write about, but what ergs me is the ever lacking audio commentary that would have been great to hear about this story. Perhaps it would have included a bit more about the ending, less fog surrounding it, but not to worry  there is a newer version, the ""Uncut Killer's Collector's Edition"" that should remedy all of these missing elements.Overall, ""American Psycho"" ranks among one of my favorite films of all time. While my list constantly grows, this remain a constant. I cannot speak any higher of Bale, or of Harron's direction which continues to impress me during each viewing. The music is what stood out in my eyes. There is a scene where someone laughs half-heartedly at a comment made by Bateman about liking Whitney Houston. I loved his interpretation of a Phil Collins song. It was these small elements that all came together perfectly for this film. ""American Psycho"" is a look within the business soul. As I watched this film, I thought of it as an extension to the ""Wall Street"" arm, could Gordon Gekko be Patrick's father? The insanity of New York, the pressures of working in a constantly obliterating corporate world, the standards of humanity  all blend together just far enough to make you question the existence of the man sitting next to you. For anyone who has ever worked for Corporate America  this is the film for you.Now, I gotta go return some videos.Grade: ***** out of *****",American Psycho
136,kevin c,HIP TO BE SQUARE,5,2 May 2000,"The first hour of this film is very good. Bale manages to make Bateman both amusing, repulsive and boring. In steering away from the violence and concentrating on the excesses and faults of the 1980s, therein lies the film's problem. It begins to get a bit repetitive. Notwithstanding it's good in comparison to some of the competition, and the ending perfectly concludes what we've learnt about Bateman.",American Psycho
137,suite92,Great visuals undone by script and direction as well as inconsistent sound capture and editing.,5,12 September 2016,"The protagonist talks directly to the viewer. This is bovine scatology. The entire film is about a delusional protagonist, so nothing is to be trusted in the plot lines, such as they are. Just because some action is depicted on the screen does not mean that it happened outside the sour operations of this afflicted mind. One might as well be suffering through Walter Mitty, except that the lead has bloody fantasies instead of Mitty's pleasant ones.So, since nothing of the exposition is to be trusted, what is the point of this vile mess?As one navigates through this maze of false threads, that is the central question. The hideous ending casts everything even deeper in doubt. The film is reminiscent of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) which was heaped with praise since Terry Gilliam directed it. That does not change the fact that after watching the film, one wonders whether Depp's character did any of the actions shown on screen. In American Psycho, the disappointment was much stronger because the production values were so much higher. Whereas FLiLV looked sleazy, AP looked exquisite; interspersed with the shock segments, that is. I expected some sort of value for having suffered through the recurring horrific images, the type one expects from a slasher film or a mild gore-fest, but done by someone like Hitchcock.If American Psycho is considered as a collage, bits of the film were good for witty conversation or for commentary on the 1980s and the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent. The collage as a whole, though, is just an incoherent collection of high quality materials badly assembled. The last two minutes were almost interesting, but the rest of the film did not support the message. The effect as a whole is doubled: who cares? It is all delusion and of no point at all.",American Psycho
138,ElijahCSkuggs,"In comparison to the book, this is rated G",8,21 August 2008,"So I've seen this movie a couple times, and after some recommendations, I decided to read the book.I don't want to turn this into a book review, but let's just say that if you're interested in something a little more graphic, a little more dark, and a little more in depth  check out the book. Immediately. And when I say ""a little more,"" that means a crap load more. It's also a lot funnier than the movie.But as far as the flick goes, it's also not too shabby. Not shabby at all.It has a nice visual style, solid directing, good pacing, and a performance from Christian Bale  especially in the last 15 minutes or so  that is simply awesome. His work is reason enough to see it alone. And I'm no Bale-kisser either. He's just damn good in this.So aside from the acting, there's some blood, some sex, some nudity, some Huey Lewis and the News, and a few hilarious scenes that make you shake your head.As much as they suck when you have to deal with them, snobs are funny, and this movie demonstrates just that. And throws in a few psychotic murders to boot.Watch the movie (rated R) and read the book (you can't rate that stuff).",American Psycho
139,jaredmobarak,I was returning some videotapesAmerican Psycho,10,2 August 2008,"Oh, the 1980's, such happy times. Excess in full force, younger upstart yuppies making money that they could only imagine as children while doing as little work as possible. When did going to lunch, out to dinner at restaurants booked for months in advance, and vying for the biggest ego constitute an occupation worth six figures? Only in America. Bret Easton Ellis' novel was looked upon as very demeaning to women in its portrayal of these masochistic males using their girls as trophies and toys, so who better to adapt and direct a feature of American Psycho than a woman such as Mary Harron. Her film version is a satire on society's fall to materialism and conformity, showing how along with the money and power comes a way of life that is unavoidable. Our lead, Patrick Bateman at one point tells his girlfriend that he is trying to fit in. He is catering to the image of masculinity and success despite his urges to break free into his own lifestyle of gratuitous sex and violence. He says early on that Patrick Bateman doesn't exist, he is an empty face hiding the darkness underneath, the scheming and desire to live on the fringe of society and be able to get away with it amongst the self-absorbed snobs running around blind to anything but themselves.The story hinges on the devolution of humanity for Bateman as the vapid existence he lives becomes too much to handle. Everything in his world is superficial, from his girlfriend, to his lithium-using mistress, to his meaningless job and his need to look and live better than his peers. One of the best scenes comes from a comparison of business cards and whose is more subtly beautiful due to the whiteness of stock and uniqueness of font. Each card is identical to the layperson, but to these men, obsessed with appearances, they couldn't be more different and inferior. It is such a cookie-cutter lifestyle that no one even knows whom each other is. They will call ""friends"" by the wrong name and then proceed to talk about how much of a reject the person they are actually speaking to is, unknowing they are insulting them to their face. It is one thing to allow the mistakes to happen, it's another to revel in it and pretend to be that other person, because really, what is the difference? Both wear the same suits, have an affinity for the same glasses, and get their hair cut at the same salon.Because of this duality in identity, Bateman is given a carte blanche to live out his dark fantasies at night. If people think he is someone else when he is raping and murdering people, he is able to live without risk of being caught. Heck, he doesn't even need an alibi because his friends are 100% positive he was out with them the night he was committing heinous crimes. Between the drugs and carbon copy personas, no one knows who they are let alone who they are with. Therefore, Bateman can do whatever he wants, and does. He lives in his own world, waxing pontifically about asinine drivel before going in for the kill.I don't think anyone could have pulled this role off besides Christian Bale. His demeanor is so likable that no one would think twice about feeling safe with him. As a model he meets and later dispatches says, ""there is something good about you."" Even when in rage, he retains his smile and jovial attitude, praising Phil Collins' talent for bringing Genesis out of their arty funk and Whitney Houston for four of the greatest songs ever written on her album appropriately titled Whitney Houston. The way his delivery makes the most benign topics jump out at you is amazing and when the blood splatters onto his face, you can't help but laugh through the carnage. No other film will make you see the humor in serial killing for sport. All Bateman does is what we fantasize about everyday, breaking free from the monotony and acting on our impulses to punish the stupid and the weak. As he tells a homeless man before killing him, ""why don't you get a job?"" It's the man's negative attitude and laziness that prevents him from succeeding in life. This is a time of self-pride and preservation, albeit an excess of said pride, that allows everyone to look at themselves as God. Even a diatribe about the troubles in South Africa and the US with poverty comes off as staged and humorous. Not because Bateman feels these subject are more relevant than Sri Lanka, but because he really doesn't care about any of it.Shot beautifully with many static frames focusing on the person's face in action rather than the activity happening around them, American Psycho is gorgeous to behold. The stark sanitation of everything: clean apartments, pristine bodies, and impeccable dressing style counters lovely with the chaos that Bateman brings from his bloodlust.It is Leto's disappearance that lends to the fact of whether what we see actually happens. Did Bateman kill him and continue with his atrocities afterwards or did Leto really go to London, where people had lunch with him, and the murder was just imagination? No one can ever really know since no character ever knows whom it is they are talking to. Perhaps those who saw Leto really saw others who pretended to be him mistakenly, or maybe he was there still alive and breathing. This is the confusion with insanity and chaos, one can't tell the difference between truth and fiction; the line blurs to infinity. American Psycho could be a tale of the psyche or a story of murderous rage left unchecked, it's really up to you to decide.",American Psycho
140,dglink,"Fascinating, Ambiguous Film Echoes Hitchcock and Lynch",9,26 September 2005,"In a world where appearances are everything and a man's status is determined by the typography, watermark, and paper quality of his business cards, lurks an empty shell of man, who is either falling deeper into madness or satisfying his intense blood lust through a series of brutal murders. Such is the ambiguity of this fascinating film that it easily stands up to repeated viewing if only to explore what is real and what is illusion. Patrick Bateman, who is a distant relative of Norman Bates in more than name, is a loner surrounded by people with whom he never relates. Although he does not hide from the world like Norman did, Patrick's icy facade, which has been conditioned and pomaded into a mask of normality, shields him from the world as effectively as the remote motel hid Norman. With his mask in place, Patrick Bateman intermingles in a world of interchangeable people, who vie with each other for social position through table reservations at trendy restaurants, the quality of a hair cut, or the fabric of a custom-tailored suit. Money flows from toil-less occupations in a New York milieu, where, as Gordon Gecko in ""Wall Street"" so aptly summed up, ""greed is good."" The Reagan era on steroids, although Bateman's peers comment negatively on the president as they watch him try to explain away the Iran-Contra scandal during a televised speech. The young men's remarks about lying are ironic, when their own lives of sham and deceit are considered.But, under the glistening surfaces, like the depths explored by David Lynch in ""Blue Velvet,"" the being who is known as Patrick Bateman lives another life, possibly in his deteriorating mind or possibly in dark back alleys and designer apartments or possibly in both simultaneously. Simply put, Patrick does not like women, and he does not like rivals, and he is eager to dispense with both through his adept use of gleaming stainless-steel axes or state-of-the-art nail shooters. While Norman Bates had deep-seated problems with sex and evidently did not have physical relations with women, Patrick does have sex with women, who are often paid. Patrick's women become debased objects that he abuses, while he admires his own physique in the mirror. Even in the most intimate act of sex, Patrick does not relate with anyone other than himself. However, unlike Norman Bates, Patrick Bateman does not have a mother complex, in fact, he does not seem to have a mother or any family at all. He is a being with no past, no relationships, and no soul. The role is difficult, and Christian Bale as Bateman is outstanding. The perfection of his looks and physique make him physically ideal for the part. But his performance is more than surface sheen, and Bale disarms the viewer as he slowly escalates from a cool emotionless young professional into a psychotic as the character descends further into his own perverted delusions or manic blood lust. Bale's is a performance as ambiguous as the film.The direction by Mary Harron is excellent as well. Harron wisely focuses on the satire inherent in the screenplay and downplays the violence, which is more often suggested than illustrated. Apparently, she has studied Hitchcock and knows that what the audience imagines can be far more powerful than what they actually see. ""American Psycho"" is a stimulating work that can provide fuel for heated discussion about what actually does or does not occur. Does the violence exist only in the pornographically violent doodles in Patrick's office agenda or did an unseen protector clean up the evidence of his series of murders? Or both? Like Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" the film swirls downward like dark water into a drain as Bateman is sucked further into madness, which eventually consumes his entire world and draws the viewer in with him.",American Psycho
141,Stampsfightclub,Brilliant Bale delivers in socially expectant drama,10,23 August 2009,"Patrick Bateman (Bale) lives and works on Wall Street, projecting an image of perfection in his busy schedule, but at night, he descends into his own experiments and fantasises.Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman in this Mary Hannon picture and with his sophisticated approach to the needy and greedy protagonist, do we viewers dive into a world where social class is everything to be successful.As the film gets under way we see the central character describe himself as an intelligent being, a man who knows what and who he likes and aims to keep it that way. Starting at a posh restaurant with his colleagues discussing the local works trends and social gossip do we get a picture of what working on Wall Street is like.American Psycho is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's novel, and the author has clearly a colourful picture on the minds of the highly prestigious workmen in America. This screenplay is marvellous, owing to the fact that Bale's character is so well thought out; a protagonist to envy and to identify with. His work is tame; his colleagues are infuriating whilst his fiancée annoys the living daylights out of him. But he continues down the same path owing to the fact he must project an important image; an image of power and success. The attitude of Bateman is quite remarkable. His self loving success driven mindset is staggering, and the Dark Knight actor is frankly remarkable in this role Many films of course look at social class workings or stereotypes. From the significant upbringing and destiny surrounding Eddie Murphy in Trading Places to the way strangers and criminals look at Sidney Poitier's cop in In the Heat of the Night but with this 2000 release, you get a significant feeling that the way you walk and talk generally affects you persona and your presentation to others, which arguably decides the fate of this film.Bateman's constant conformity to the general high standards of Wall Street leave him wanting more and when he is at home watching porn, experimenting with face products or doing his exercise regimes, he descends into a world of madness, and this is where the film drives into exciting mystery.After Paul Allen shows him a business card and forgets his name once too often, Bateman introduces him to his axe, and after this arguably frightening sequence, the character base is set and the expectancy to see Bateman's next move is anticipation of the highest degree.Honestly even as the caped crusader Bale has never been more impressive. His depiction of this character is completely accurate and interesting. He derives from a standard of madness and makes it fascinating psychologically whilst oddly, surprisingly comic at various points. The character is a joy; a privilege to watch and observe and the madness may give Hamlet a run for his money. A must watch for the sheer brilliance of the character development and Bale's performance.",American Psycho

I cant really explain what the story is because i really didnt understand it, but i did like the underlining theme of the film which is the 1980's  and the greed that went on in wall street. The materialistic views of the yuppies and their female friends are very funny in the film and if that it what the film was solely about i would have enjoyed it but the had a story in there somewhere about a seriel killer, which to me didnt make sense and spoilt it. Perhaps if i watch it again i will understand it more but somehow i dont think so.

The characters seem cartoonish, and impossibly venal and corrupted. Is this really the culture of America's big investment banks and its running dogs? After this year's corporate scandals, maybe ""American Psycho"" would be an improvement.Politics and sociology aside, ""American Psycho"" is an uneven film. The acting is superb and Christian Bale's portrayal of the sociopathic young banker, Patrick Bateman, drips cold menace even while ordering dinner. The first two-thirds of the movie are very effective, walking a narrow line between horror and satire. But during the final third, the film changes direction, loses focus, and doesn't finish well. I'm conflicted whether to recommend this movie. The film is graphically violent and misogynistic (and as a consequence, disturbing). If you can handle rough films, you might give it a try. But in my opinion, ""American Psycho"" is a near miss.",American Psycho
144,stamper,Emh..........well..........eh.........WHAT THE HELL was that?,6,4 December 2000,"I do not quite know what the hell I saw the other night, watching this film, which is about a yuppie in the eighties who's got it all. He's got a good job in which he needs to do nothing, for his father owns the firm; he's got money; friends; a beautiful girlfriend plus he looks rather well. But somehow all of that has gotten into his mind and seriously screwed him up. He is just emotionless, greedy and narcissistic. That is about everything this film is about, it is a movie about the lifestyle of an eighties yuppie. There is not much more to it, because the film lacks excitement, graphic display of Bateman's deeds and explanation. I think the latter can be obtained by watching the film for the second time, but for the rest, you'll probably have to read the book. What killed' this movie though was it's lack of excitement (fear of Bateman or even thrills when you start wondering what he is up to next). This film is no classic at all, though I think it could have been, if Stanley Kubrick had directed it (even in the same way), for it reminds me a hell of a lot of A Clockwork Orange and because everything Kubrick made is regarded as a masterpiece (although I often do not get why). Without having read the book I can advise you, read it first and then, maybe watch this movie, for the special think about this story could not even be screwed up by the director, whereas the rest could be. Anyway the movie was pretty vague and somewhere between good and bad, which means it was somewhere between a 4 and a 8, so averaging those two grades this one gets a

145,The_Movie_Cat,"Errrrr.... can I have my money back, please?",6,26 April 2000,"That's what I would have said if I hadn't won free tickets. Even then I was half-tempted.American Psycho is a movie above average in execution but ultimately hollow with an anti-climatic ending the like of which I've never seen before. Obviously this is a no-spoiler zone so I can't reveal it, but suffice it to say that rather than the reality-shifting conceit that turns great films (such as Fight Club or Jacob's Ladder) into arguably greater ones,  turns this one into a thorough waste of time and effort.Can it be true that this film has already generated controversy? Surely not? Surely in the 21st century we're all used to disembodied heads and chainsaw massacres by now? And if all the right-wing lobbies that complain about sex and violence in movies spend their whole time watching the stuff in order to complain about it, then how come they're not converted into our very own Patrick Batemans? The film actually raises this point itself, with Bateman (Christian Bale), watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre while exercising.This being England, we got to see a version 4 minutes longer than its U.S. counterpart, as it included senses of lesbianism. It sometimes bothers me that the world is still full of such reactionism that such things can fall foul of censorship. What bothers me more is that films which usually attract such controversy as this usually have the saving grace of being actually quite good - A Clockwork Orange being a notable success in that field. American Psycho, meanwhile, is a fairly average movie, with gory violence that neither shocks nor compels, and a vaguely witty narrative that can be seen as satirical by the same sort of people that think Scream is cleverly ironic.Bale plays a psychotic with some interesting characteristics. He's anally retentive and talks his victims through the critical plusses of MOR 80s pop-rock. He's also pro-racial equality, yet homophobic and narcissistic. Some of these conflicting character traits are interesting, and Bale does well becoming a semi-monotone serial killer while managing to maintain a level of charisma.I must make a confession, tantamount to heresy - I haven't read the very popular book on which the film is based. But I see that factor as largely irrelevant; the film should stand on it's own merits, exist without it's source text. So I cannot judge whether it represents the visual ideology of the novel, or whether it betrays its concept. What I do know of the film is that while it does have some flimsy barbs about the nature of consumerism and pitiless American culture, it is ultimately shallow and without meaning.The cast are all great, the direction is good without being ostentatious and the dialogue is fresh without ever - quite - getting too silly. What it lacks is a core, or purpose. And when the final twist ending comes along, it defies all that went before it and makes you realise that you've sat through a film as pumped-up, self-serving and internally vacant as it's central character.",American Psycho

This is a very deeply serious portrayal of a competitive business man with aggressive violent actions. He is completely self absorbed. He does have insight: ""There is nothing there.""

During the day, he is an almost perfect male, working at his father's company and hanging out with his buddies, while during the night, he satisfies his gruesome pleasures and lust for blood by killing random people.As the movie progresses, his thirst begins to grow so it becomes increasingly hard to control himself in the presence of other people. Almost any motif is good enough to kill so he thoroughly plans his every move until one day when the situation gets truly out of control so a real massacre is about to occur. The finale is truly one of the most idiotic I have ever seen but I will not spoil it in case you really want to see this film. Christian Bale is a great actor and he plays his role with style but unfortunately for me, this is one of those movies I cannot enjoy due to its senseless murdering and its course of events which ultimately lead to an abrupt ending without consequences.This movie is all about brutal violence, sex and social envy, so if you're into this type of movies, this is for you.

151,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,To the point,8,26 December 2006,"Patrick Bateman has everything: money, good looks, health, nice apartment, and an easy going high paying job. Beneath this business school success story, however, lies a dark man who knows and even acknowledges that he has everything, but wants more...Since this is an adaptation you can see this movie as too different things: as an adaptation of the novel, or as just a movie if you haven't read the novel. As a movie it is well done, especially with Bale's frightening performance as the callous Bateman, and it is that with the general ambition that went into the project that overshadows the film's obvious limitations. And there are quite a few of them. I have never read the book, but have heard about it enough to see that the film is aesthetically way below the scope of the novel. The locations and sets simply just barely manage to cut it. However the film is a success due its tone.The themes, metaphors, and idea of the book presented in such a way that you get the feeling that yes, the filmmakers know the source material, like the source material and put in an honest effort to get it translated to the screen. After all, it is the themes and ideas that matter more than the actual physical look of the film. ""Apocalypse Now"" looks nothing like Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" - different time period, different locations, etc... - but the fundamental themes of the novel (the stuff that matters most) are there and it is a great movie based off of a great book. With ""American Psycho"" fans can delight in the adaptation as also being faithful in the aesthetic sense.However, fans should also be ready to forgive. Think about it, would any major studio release a movie with a seriously f***ed up lead character like Bateman? Author Bret Easton Ellis was himself shot down by publishers before he got his book out, so this isn't mainstream thought and metaphor here. It is un-PC, hard to swallow, but daring in it's ambitions and that is what makes the film good. --- 8/10Rated R for strong violent content and sex",American Psycho

The only problem is now that is the kind of image that I have of him as a real person. A cold-hearted selfish b*stard.It is also very true to life. How these playboy millionaires get away with everything that they do. Even murder. The film sets forth an image that is both intriguing and terrifying. It almost gets you in the mood to harm people. Thank god that I didn't. His character is similar to his later character that he portrays in SHAFT. He kills his victims out of rage and anguish. All in all, the film is a good insight to the types of living conditions that we have today. Rich kid kills someone and just gets away with it because he is rich. That blows!

The film is about an executive who fantacizes about having affairs with and killing women with blond hair. The killings are gruesome ones reminiscent of slasher films. I remember there to be far much more gore than there was an artistic psychological aspect. All in all, this film was fairly disturbing and it is not the sort of film that you can expect to enjoy.

157,Ben_Cheshire,"One of the darkest, most cynical movies ever made - but maybe not for the reasons you think.",8,19 April 2004,"I think this movie deserves to be controversial, but not for the reasons it has. I don't believe it is in any way irresponsible filmmaking - never did i feel the filmmakers were endorsing the behaviour of Patrick Bateman and the society he was a part of (1987 New York Yuppie) - if anything, they too strongly hint to the audience that they are satirising this materialistic world through turning character into charicature. In fact, this movie gives new viciousness to the word ""satire.""It is a fascinating movie - absolutely compelling, in fact. Its cartoon-like characters are marvellous to watch, and often it is very funny, though we are constantly reminded that the jokes are at the expense of these obnoxious characters, who in turn are sending up an entire way of life now referred to as ""the excesses of the 80's."" But through this very specific period-grounding of the film (1987, constantly reinforced through the soundtrack and the fashion victims...badum, ching!) the movie creates a very dark picture of human nature in general, and warns against letting society become like this again, where material worth and surface value are all that matter.At one point Bateman's girlfriend says to him, ""We have to talk."" He replies: ""You look gorgeous, there's nothing to talk about."" This precice bit of dialogue encapsulates the lack of real human interaction in this society. No two characters properly have a conversation in this movie - everyone is constantly performing a monologue at someone else, to satisfy their own whims.The director described the movie as having dual stories: Bateman's group of ""friends"" and business associates provide social satire of this vacuous society, and the other story follows the misadventures of Patrick Bateman, Serial Killer by Night. This part of the movie is really no different to any other crime movie, where we follow the criminal. Certainly not as controversial as i had heard, because the filmmakers are constantly trying to make a point.(spoilers... what i think that point is...)These two stories are not totally independent, they very much serve each other. The central point of Bateman's being a serial killer is a very dark demonstration of what one does if one loses all contact with other human beings. If you only care about surfaces, and not about anything deeper, then there's no reason not to go out and slaughter people, if this satisfies you. In this way, Bateman is enabled by the society around him (which encourages the worship of surfaces). This is perfectly presented in the final scene of the movie, which may seem not very climactic action-wise, because it is mainly a climax of the unification of these two story lines. No-one will listen to Bateman when he tries to confess his crimes. No-one will hear him, because everyone only cares about themselves and surfaces. The irony of Bateman's uncontrollably going out and killing people at whim is that this then becomes a secret for him, something deep and real, that, perhaps for the first time, he feels emotion over. It is something that goes beyond the usual ""where should we make a reservation"" or ""check out my new business card"" chit-chat that is the level this people live on. So when he tries to tell his lawyer this, the lawyer suddenly pretends not to know him.(spoilers still!)Identity is a big thing for Patrick Bateman, which explores the issue: if the physical/material is all that matters in this society, what is a human being? At the beginning Bateman tells us he has all the physical attributes of a human being, but on the inside, there's nothing, just an empty shell. This is why Bateman's mentioning ""the inside"" again in the final scene is significant. Ghostly visual references to Bateman only being an empty shell abound: Bateman's face is constantly shown hidden, distorted through translucent glass.(end spoilers)I think its a movie to see. I saw it again, and liked it a whole heap more the second time. The more you see it, the more of its satire you pick up (not that its subtle, but you laugh at it more).",American Psycho

159,ofpsmith,"""This is not an exit.""",9,23 September 2019,"In New York, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a wealthy, young and handsome yuppie executive who is exceedingly vapid and vain, professes socially attractive beliefs that he doesn't believe in, generally dislikes his peers, is generally disliked by his peers, is regarded as lazy and a waste by those outside his social circle, dates an equally vapid and vain woman, and cheats on her with his peers' spouses (who are, of course, as vapid and vain as they are.) Patrick belongs to a subculture of wealthy, young and handsome yuppie executives, who are exceedingly vapid and vain, profess socially attractive beliefs that they don't believe in, generally dislike their peers, are generally disliked by their peers, are regarded as lazy and as wastes by those outside their social circle, date equally vapid and vain women, and cheat on them with their peers' spouses (who are, of course, as vapid and vain as they are.) They are all the same, so much so that they call each other by the wrong name. These wasters go to New York's finest clubs and restaurants every night, dabbling in expensive clothing, food, hair product, and cocaine. They discuss music and fashion advice. They waste away the hard earned fortunes of their parents without actually doing much work themselves. Nevertheless, they are all aware of one thing; they're better than you. Patrick however, is slightly different, and markets himself in a particular way. First of all he may be aware of how superficial and ridiculous this subculture is (though this does not change his participation in it.) And secondly, he may or may not be a serial killer. Perhaps desperate to find individuality in a world lacking it or perhaps severely ill, Patrick makes himself different from those around him by killing people. Anybody. Coworkers (especially if they make him insecure), the homeless, women off the street, security guards, anyone. Sometimes the motive is clear. Other times it's completely random. The movie and novel are told from his perspective so it's completely possible that he's imaging all of this and that it's not actually happening. The movie sometimes doesn't follow its own logic but this is all part of the appeal. I've heard people claim American Psycho to be a horror film. Certainly it has those kinds of elements but I'd call it more of a dark comedy. It has a dark, satirical comic edge to it. It's not for the faint of heart but generally speaking it's one to watch.",American Psycho
160,oneloveall,Admirable combination of laughs and fears,7,10 May 2007,"Impressive adaptation of the brutal satire detailing early 90's yuppie excess, Bret Easton Ellis's controversial novel comes to sparkling life with equal measures of hilarity and depravity. In ripping the often referenced book for a cinematic reincarnation, director Mary Harron certainly had her work cut out for her. Substituting some of the unbearably graphic images which would fester inside readers heads for a more suggestive style, Harmon brilliantly recreates this hard-edged satire for the silver screen with very few discrepancies.Thriving off of the psychotically committed effort from lead Christian Bale, American Psycho might not be as bluntly effective as some of it's harsher passages would beckon, but nonetheless remains one of modern Hollywood's most brilliant and scorching satires on the materialistic excess plaguing the late 80's early 90's for many ambitious Americans. It is that memorable time period that is captured so convincingly amidst Bateman's psychotic urges that makes the film larger then it's subject. Many will classify American Psycho as a horror film on the warped mindset behind a serial killer, though it becomes clear by film's end that a sharply cutting comedic commentary on those highly egotistical years play more of a role in describing what makes this violent and sadistic man tick then expected.In turn, American Psycho becomes a glorious dark comedy, even if a little repetitious, whilst Bale continues to terrify audiences with his disturbingly perfect portrait. It is a character definitely prone to caricature, completely convincing in the rare evil silences we witness when Bales becomes engulfed in his struggling darkness, which viewers will, upon further viewings, analyze further due to an ambiguous ending. Though short of the character study masterpiece I had ideally hoped for, the film will remain a nihilistic joy with stinging psychological sentiment for years to come.",American Psycho

162,RJBurke1942,Beware of what you wish for  you might just get it!,8,12 December 2007,"This is a finely constructed allegory for all that is dark and horrible about the excesses of modernity, as epitomized by a yuppie stockbroker, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) as he descends into his insanity.You see, Patrick doesn't exist in reality: he only exists, in the minds of others, as a cardboard cutout  much like his exquisite business card that doesn't quite cut it when compared to his friends'  who occupies a vacuous space in his vacuous office where he goes through the vacuous motions of doing vacuous business in a vacuous world...And, all the while, Patrick's frustrations, doubts, self-loathing and contempt for the world all mix together in his mind to produce the only outlet he can generate: supreme anger at a system that must be cleansed, and violently.So, he goes on a secret killing spree  removing office competitors, prostitutes, drunks, deadbeats, ex-lovers and whoever else takes his fancy. Precisely clinical in his office at work, at the bar with his friends, or at dinner with his fiancée or lover, Patrick executes  the very operative word  all those dregs of society with the same dispassionate disdain that he holds for the world in general.Bale is simply superb in this role, one that must have been very difficult to portray; little wonder that he was nominated for a good number of awards (he won a Best Actor award). Kudos (and awards!) also goes to the scriptwriters, Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner, for a clever and witty narrative. I've not read the book, but now I think I should, despite all the bad press from long ago.Yes, this is a horror story; but the horror is not in the violence that, for the most part and when compared to other films, is muted. The real horror is that which occurs in Patrick's psyche, as he tries to sort out the fictions of the real world from the reality of his fictional and insane world. Hence, as a viewer, it's often difficult to sort out those things also...which is perhaps the major sub-text of this story when applied to the world in which we all live, whatever our worlds are. Sure, the story is over-the-top, but it's a satire as well as an allegorical tour-de-force; so, treat it as such.It's not for every body, that's for sure, and certainly not for adolescents. As adults, however, we should all welcome a narrative such as this, to allow our own mind to dwell upon the issues raised, which are many as well as varied. For example, how often have I said to somebody, in jest: ""Don't do that, or I'll kill you""? This story examines that type of behavioral idea - with a vengeance.The production is slick, as it should be on Wall Street, glitzy restaurants and sumptuous surrounds; the supporting cast is equal to Bale's performance, but there's no doubt he dominates, as he should in this role; and it was great to listen to some good oldies from Phil Collins and others.Highly recommended for adults who aren't afraid to look within this narrative...and perhaps within themselves.",American Psycho
163,Christian_Dimartino,Christian Bale is marvelous here. His best performance.,10,25 July 2011,"Christian Bale is one of the best actors of our time, and he really showed it back in 2000 with his underrated performance in American Psycho. American Psycho, in my opinion, is his best performance. With every film he does, he always tries very hard, and you can tell with his performance in this film.Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a wall street worker who cares too much about appearance and not really about anyone else. But secretly, he is a sociopath that murders a ton of people, including hookers and co-workers.Thats basically the movie. It may not sound like a lot, but oh yes it is. The scenes with the murder are the most engaging. American Psycho is non stop entertaining, and its Bale who holds out interest.Never before have I seen a more disturbed maniac than Patrick Bateman. Bale brings the life into this psycho, and you can't take your eyes off of him. Though he's such a horrible person, I liked him, and its hard to like a sociopath. But when Christian Bale is that sociopath, its hard not to.Bale is the heart and soul of American psycho. Besides him, you won't be able to take your eyes off of it, and there is some dark humor here that takes off.

164,Movie-12,A great visual and psychological achievement. Christian Bale delivers a knock-out performance. **** (out of four),10,7 October 2001,"AMERICAN PSYCHO / (2000) **** (out of four)Patrick Bateman: I think my mask of sanity is about to slip. ---""American Psycho""	The average filmmaker would turn ""American Psycho"" into an exploitative slasher flick, but Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have adapted the controversial novel by Bret Easton Ellis into something unique and intriguing, a brilliant, thought-provoking social commentary thriller.Readers criticized the decade old novel because of its graphic violence, but that doesn't cause Turner and Harron to give into the controversial material. I have never read the book, but after watching ""American Psycho,"" I intend to. It's a scathing, rare film that probes our imagination and beliefs while experimenting with true psychological terror. It often makes startling switches between scenes of dark comedy and sequences that portray unsettling, graphic images. Director Mary Harron says in the film's press notes that she wanted all but one of the violent sequences to be disturbing. The amount of blood and violence here is certainly extreme, but considering the nature of the beast, not overly abundant. The film calculates every single act of violence, therefore, the victims are seldom random characters, but people we care about, which is why the scenes are so timely and effective.
The best description of the film's main character, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) comes from Christopher Lehmann-Houpt of The New York Times. ""Patrick Bateman lives in a morally flat world in which clothes have more value than skin, objects are worth more than bones, and the human soul is something to be sought with knives and hatchets and drills.""
Both leading actors in ""American Psycho"" have previously portrayed Jesus Christ, Willem Dafoe in ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" and Christian Bale in ""Mary, Mother of Jesus."" Talk about versatility. It's probably not a coincidence that Christian Bale was the initial actor of preference for Mary Harron. If an actor can display such a fascinating performance as Jesus Christ, he's more than capable of playing a psychotic serial killer because he already knows the other side of the moral spectrum.
Through the strong central character, ""American Psycho"" suggests several themes about the 1980's, including society's obsession with outer perfection, conformity, the rising threshold of material fetishism, and the strong desire of stimulation by drugs, sex, money, and power. Patrick Bateman isn't given a back story, however, and the movie doesn't offer his personal history. Bateman has no inside emotions. He reacts by inner impulse alone. He seeks gratification through the sex and drugs, but also by engaging in the homicidal behavior.    ""You could describe American Psycho' as a film about perfect surfaces and what might be lurking beneath,"" says Mary Harron. ""Inside, Bateman might want it all to stop, but for him it's a compulsion. He's like the serial killer in M, who says: You have a choice, but I can't help what I am.'""""American Psycho"" initially earned an NC-17 rating, not because of the violence but because of the graphic sexual content. The director's cut is available on videocassette and DVD, which shows the film's three-way sex scene in more disturbing, yet innovative, detail. That's a good thing, if you're not a sensitive viewer, because this film is all about details. The production design, the cinematography, the visual effects, the engaging soundtrack, the quirks each actor masterfully incorporates with their character, and every other aspect of the film is flush in detail.
This is a movie that requires more than one viewing, to experience the surreal visual arena, and to justify what we think actually happened. Perplexingly, the film's conclusion puts the events into question. Did Bateman really kill these people, or did he just really want to? The answers don't come easy, but this is a movie that begs us to look closer",American Psycho

166,alice liddell,Pretty much as you'd expect.,3,7 June 2000,"If you were to make a satire of the American 80s, that infamous, hollow, bombastic, ultra-materialist, cruel decade, how would you do it?  Would you have a male hero, in this decade of Rambo, Arnie and Gordon Gekko, where even women wanted to be men?  Would you fetishise minimalism - elaborately tiny meals; shiny apartments with hardly any furniture etc. - to emphasise the spiritual emptiness of the decade?  Would you foreground the most ghastly, soulless, manufactured music to demonstrate the assembly-line reduction of emotions?  Would you mock the obsession with restaurants, big suits, vanity products, the mimicking of a 20s aristocracy sieved of all Gatsbyesque romance; where new, utility products don't make life easier, but serve to alienate you further from you 'loved' ones, your peers, your surroundings?  Would you show how, beneath the civilised sheen, the most barbaric ritual rites retain (and I'm not just talking about the serial killing)?  Would your hero be so obsessed with appearance, image (lots of mirrors and reflections), fitting in, that he would cease to be himself, that he would be alienated from himself, that he would become a literal double of himself with nothing inside?  Would you show the abuse of marginal figures such as the homeless?  Would you compare all this to the obscenities of the Reagan era?Sounds easy, doesn't it?  And that, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, is the problem with AMERICAN PSYCHO - it goes for the easy option every time.  It is no excuse to argue that the film is thin and superficial, that its satire is far too broad, because so was the decade.  By making this American psycho so ridiculous, so harmlessly, buffoonishly camp; by making the kind of emasculated satirical swipes a Republican might enjoy; only evades the true moral decadence of the era.The device of suggesting that everything that Bateman does is a mere projection of his fantasies, in the way the whole decade was a paralysing projection of materialist fantasies, goes back at least as far as LAURA, but whereas that classic tried to deconstruct the image of the police detective, and the very real authority invested in him, Bateman is just a dork, as everyone says.  He is too silly to be scary, his social position isn't adequately delineated to make him powerful.This in itself is satirical - what DOES Bateman do to make so much money? Is he really daddy's boy, or just another wannabe vice-president among dozens?  Why does he pick his particular victims?  In Paul Allen's case it's clear enough, immature envy.  But why prostitutes and the homeless (echoes of Bunuel, Kubrick, Ferrera)?  Because they refuse to conform to the glorious 80s ethic, they don't want to fit in like he does, they give the lie to his era's self-confidence?  Because they exist on the margin, as he would truly like to?  But he is as 'unproductive' and marginal as they are. Donald Kimball is set up as some kind of doppelganger (the film seems very indebted to Poe; or is this a nod to 80s academic theory?), but this kind of disintegrates as the plot breaks down, presumably to mirror its protagonists increasing madness.The style is as anonymous as its subject - again, correspondence between form and content isn't really enough; CLAIRE DOLAN has shown how the evocation of a soulless environment can be made critically meaningful. The lack of budget deadens the impact of the action hero climax.  If the film has a saving grace, it is the performance of Christian Bale, effecting, for some reason, an excellent impression of Jim Carrey, doing what he can to wring laughs from the predictable material (the BEN-HUR-like threesome is hilarious).  I watched DRILLER KILLER after this, a real American psycho whose trauma is rooted in an emotional crisis Bateman can never have because he is, as he says, a cipher.",American Psycho

I was aware of this movie for a while but avoided it because I thought the acting would be dry. However, I finally sat down to watch it and was blown away. Its strongest pillar is none other than Mr. Bale. Trust me; you've never seen him like this. His character is sadistic, redefines cruel and is a true sociopath, and yet you can't turn away. Bale also adds dabbles of what seem to be regret within it all and it leaves one wondering; what will Patrick Bateman's next move be?It also offers the great performances of William Dafoe, and others. Taking place during the 80s, one can't help but feel Bale's character was driven to this sick path due to some feeling of social isolation. The 80s here are depicted as an era of the ""fast times'. A growing gap between the rich and poor (reminiscent of Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street""), people's ever growing affinity with drugs and of course the music that was there but also wasn't. In his meticulous mind, he appears to be the only one who seems to actually be paying attention to what he's hearing. Strangely idealistic and yet without direction, it's one of the strangest characters you'll ever see on screen.Bold, sickening and just exhilarating, check out ""American Psycho"".",American Psycho
168,FlickJunkie-2,A Directorial Hack Job,4,9 September 2000,"Not having read the book, I will take this film on its own merits. `American Psycho' is a satirical horror film that had greater potential than was realized.  Mary Harron's adaptation and direction seems to be the problem.  Part of the story was a lampoon of the excessive materialism of the 1980's, focusing particularly on the yuppie lifestyle.  That should have served as the background for the character study.  However, Harron pushed it to the foreground and exaggerated the portrayals of yuppie superficiality and arrogance to the point where it became sophomoric.  She then pounded on the point until it was threadbare.The film would have benefited from more development of Bateman's tortured inner self rather than this obsession with his and his friends' way of life. The story presented an opportunity for a fresh approach to the horror genre.  Most horror films are presented from the perspective of the victims, whereas this story was from the killer's perspective.  In addition, since it was a first person narrative, we had an opportunity to look inside the killer's head.  Though some of that was done, too much of the introspection focused on his thoughts about his lifestyle and not enough on his feelings about the people he was killing or the acts themselves.Another problem is that the killings were sloppily done.  In most cases it is inconceivable that he wouldn't have been immediately apprehended based on all the forensic evidence he was leaving behind.  This is the director's way of giving us a not so subtle push as to how to interpret the ending.  If the killings were masterfully planned and executed, the ending would have been much more perplexing and effective.  The acting by Bale was excellent.  Though I didn't agree with Harron's vision of Bateman as the poster child for yuppie conceit and tawdriness, Christian Bale played the caricature to the hilt.  He was more pompous and supercilious than your typical Roman Emperor.  The scene depicting his emotional disintegration was terrifically done and very intense.Overall, the way the story was presented created an air of incredulity about all the characters and their behavior, which took the effectiveness out of the psychological angle.  That left us with a mindless horror flick with only mediocre effects.  Despite some excellent acting, I rated this film a 4/10.  A directorial hack job marred a good story concept.  Since it failed miserably at the box office, the film's best hope is that it becomes a cult classic in rental.  It is kitsch enough for that to be a distinct possibility.",American Psycho

170,moviesleuth2,Provocative satire of the 80's,7,5 December 2009,"I watched this movie a few years ago and although I respected it, I didn't care for it because it was so superficial. I watched it again, realizing what it was trying to do. This time I liked it a lot better.Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a Wall Street wizard, living the dream life. He's young, successful, and good looking. But everything is not right with Patrick. He is incapable of any emotion ""except greed and disgust."" He sees himself as a facade (""I am simply not there""). But while living the good life by day, he is a serial killer by night.For anyone who follows the politics of movie making, ""American Psycho"" is one of the more notorious. It's yet another example of the MPAA's prudishness getting in the way of film-making. The film was given an NC-17 rating until director Mary Harron was forced to cut a scene where Bateman is having a threesome with two prostitutes. Never mind that it is extremely revealing about his character, nor the fact that they left all of the bloody violence untouched. It's a sex-scene, which is a no-no for the MPAA (none of its members, apparently, have cable television, because if they did, they would notice that there are more explicit sex scenes on weekly TV shows).But that shouldn't detract from the quality of the film (the unrated DVD has been out for a few years, so there's no need to accept the MPAA's neo-conservative version). The film is well-acted, and often darkly humorous.Christian Bale burst onto the A list after his dynamite performance as Bateman. His cool, smooth voice belies his capacity for violence. Yet Bateman can change moods instantaneously, and Bale is adept at switching moods at will, even only for a few seconds. The other cast members (Josh Lucas, Justin Theroux, Reese Witherspoon, and so on) are great as his friends and co-workers (or fiancée, as Witherspoon is), who are so superficial and self-centered that they don't know, or care, about Bale's extracurricular activities (and it's not as if he's THAT discreet about it). Samantha Mathis is good as is drugged-out mistress, and Willem Dafoe is solid as the private detective who may or may not be onto Bale.Mary Harron knows and understands the material. It's a thriller, but also a dark comedy. The humor isn't in your face, but if you really think about it, these characters are completely ridiculous. She's not afraid to show violence, but she also knows that she's not making a slasher movie.Maybe it's because I'm not a child of the 80's, but I didn't get all the humor. I got the satire about being superficial, but the serial killer aspect eluded me. Still, it's enjoyable enough to recommend.",American Psycho

I watched the whole movie and I say it was a good film with lots and lots of twists and turns. You would never expect stuff to happen, well I at least didnt know when those prostitutes died. It was very weird how he put body parts in his kitchen. As soon as I found that he kiled people, I would've tried to kill him. He kind of reminds me of Jack the Ripper. Christian Bale played so cool as the mass murderer. He was perfect for the role and dig into his music like Phil Collins. He always described things before he killed his victims. I really liked this movie and it was enjoyable and incredibly spooky!8/10",American Psycho
173,Antagonisten,Well worth watching,7,20 March 2005,"American Psycho really struck a chord with me when i first saw it at the theater when it came out in 2000. And after seeing it a couple of times more on DVD i can say that the fascination still lives.I wouldn't call myself a fan of the Brett Easton Ellis book that this movie is based on. While i felt the book did have it's points, i was put off by the overly crude descriptions of violence. While i understood the points Ellis' was trying to make i thought it was excessive and not at all to my tastes. Also the book became somewhat tedious in it's descriptions of pop culture and 1980's phenomena.The movie however i feel has removed much of what put me off with the book. The brutal violence and gore is toned down (but still present enough to get the point through i think) and the references to 1980's culture are more easily and quickly done in the format of a movie. In this way i felt the satire was more pure and focused in the movie, of course many people are likely to think that the experience is diluted because much of the extreme aspects are gone. I do not, however, share this view.The first aspect of the movie that strongly appealed to me was Christian Bale. He's just perfect as the well-cut, rich, successful and utterly insane yuppie Patrick Bateman. The casting overall is excellent, but i must say Bale stands out as something of a sensation.I have seen a lot of discussion on many different message boards about whether the murders in this movie were real, or if they were just a figment of Batemans imagination. My return question is immediately: does it matter? Bret Easton Ellis was on to something when he wrote his book, and that point is further refined here. In a world where every man just cares for himself, and nobody cares about anyone else, it's possible to get away with almost anything. For instance ripping a company apart leaving thousands without a job, or maybe even murder... The idea of the psychopath being allowed to do whatever he pleases without punishment, be it physical or economical harm. To me the concept is what's interesting, not whether he did it or not. The fact that he had fantasies about doing it is enough, the only thing really stopping him was his own inhibitions. Getting away with it was the least of the problems for one who was so inclined.I think that American Psycho will appeal to many people for many different reasons. Some people will see it as plain comedy, others will recognize it more for what it is. I found it interesting and well worth watching, no matter if you have read the book or not. I rate it 7/10.",American Psycho
174,apryla-58795,"""I'm in Murders & Executions""",10,26 August 2018,"Wow! Just wow! I have seen this movie 3 times since it's release. The first time I saw it I was largely shocked, disturbed, disgusted and wishing I could unsee it. BUT I also was blown away by Christian Bale's performance. Now...I have seen the videos and I've heard the rumors about him being difficult to work with etc...but you have to give credit where it's due - he was absolutely brilliant & amazing in this role. If you have not seen this film you truly have to experience it. I don't condone the goriness or the pornographic material or the extreme violence but viewing it is almost like a study of two things. First of all if for nothing else it's a master acting class. Secondly it's to see an actor perform the role of a lifetime in general but also to see the best performance I believe of Christian Bale's career. I haven't seen all of his films but I've seen most of them and I have to say that even though he is a great actor I don't think any of his other roles come close to this one. I would even go so far as to say that I think it's probably one of the best if not the best performance I've ever seen from any actor ever in all the films I've seen and I've seen a lot. Here is why I think that. He took what I think is possibly one of the most difficult characters to portray and he 1000% nailed it. I think Patrick Bateman would be one of the most difficult characters to portray due to that fact that not only did CB have to commit to this role physically (which is no small thing) he had to find some way to completely get inside the mind of a psychopath and portray that. This role was an extreme challenge because the Patrick Bateman character was acting himself so as to not give away that he was a psychopath. He knew that to be accepted in society he had to act. He was not being his true self so everything about him was an outward act. So not only did Christian Bale have to act like Patrick Bateman - he had to act like an idea of what Patrick Bateman thought he should act like! That is some serious material to master.The murder scenes are really where you see the truly brilliant talent. It's so terrifyingly unsettling because he kills his victims so violently yet the scene is juxtaposed with extremely over the top humor all while listening to popular upbeat music while it's happening. That is so much for the mind to take in. It's almost like your mind is overloaded and you can't deal with it. But as weird as it sounds it's beautiful to behold.I didn't think I'd ever watch it again but I did so several years later out of curiousity just to see if my reactions to it had changed...Nope! Still the same. And then several years after that viewing I watched it for a 3rd time the other night when my husband decided to watch it again because he hadn't seen it in years either and was curious to see what he thought after all that time had gone by. My reaction-about the same but yet with an even deeper appreciation of Christian Bale's performance.I had forgotten about all the other actors who were in it. They did well in their roles as well.This is one of the films that the more you watch it the more you pick up or notice. The one liners are great ""I've got to return some videotapes!"" ""Have a holly jolly Christmas."" So funny! Plus there's other things that you pick up that you didn't notice in previous viewings such as - this time around I noticed that when Christian Bale's character goes to chase that hooker down the hallway he's completely naked yet he found time to put on tennis shoes before he started chasing her. I never noticed that before. Just imagining him putting on his tennis shoes before he goes to kill her it's just ridiculous! It is so funny to me and I completely missed that the last two times I watched it. It's just one more small detail that shows you inside the character's mind.I'm not one who gets into violence or the exploitation of women and oddly enough I can't even say I liked the film. But I can appreciate a great performance and while I could have done without a lot of those scenes they aren't just gratuitous. They really were necessary to portray this character.I would highly recommend this film.",American Psycho
175,ronakkotian,"Quotable, memorable and perfectly executed",10,6 August 2021,"When I think of Christian Bale's performances, two come to mind: Bruce Wayne in The Dark Knight Trilogy and Patrick Bateman in American Psycho.American Psycho follows Patrick Bateman, a wealthy businessman in the 1980's that hides his alter ego from the people he knows during the day and enjoys his murderous tendencies at night.Easily one of my favourite films of all time, American Psycho is a film I won't ever get tired of. To be clear, American Psycho isn't meant to be viewed as a serious thriller but rather a dark comedy. The film does such an excellent job introducing us to Bateman's persona as we really learn how narcissistic and superficial of a person he really is. It leaves great hints into the violent thoughts he has at the start and slowly descends into the chaos in a way that feels organic. Not only that, the film provides us with very clever commentary on the self-adulation of businessmen during the simplest of scenes such as a group of them discussing business cards. The direction, sound design and acting all combined tells us all about Bateman and his co-workers. Mary Harron directed this story with immense skill. She balances the violence with enough comedy that somehow makes it hilarious rather than disturbing and the script, filled with memorable sequences and quotable lines, attribute to that tone.The creation of the 80's is also an aspect I admire. From the visual representation of New York City to the monologues on music from Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins and Whitney Houston, all of this meshes to create an accurate representation of that time period. When it comes to performances, Christian Bale steals the show. One of his best performances to date, Bale's portrayal of Patrick Bateman is brilliant on so many levels. With the tone he uses for certain lines to reveal the character's narcissism to the deep, dark and piercing effect he creates once he goes about violent tendencies, Bale's acting is top-notch. Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto are also great in their short roles.American Psycho is a unique character study that works incredibly due to the synergy between Mary Harron's direction, the script and Christian Bale's powerhouse of a performance. It's a beautifully constructed piece of work that will remain as one of my favourite films of all time.",American Psycho
176,garethcrook,Magnificent.,9,31 May 2020,"If I'm honest, I'm only here for Huey Lewis. Just kidding... although I do love Huey Lewis. I do love this film too though. It's a rare occasion where I like the film as much as it's source, maybe even more than. Easton Ellis' book is a masterpiece, even more gruesome than what's committed to screen here, but what it doesn't have is Christian Bale. He's on fire here, my favourite performance (he's also great in The Machinist and Le Mans 66). Here though, as Patrick Bateman, the meticulous psychopathic yuppie, he's magnificent. Bateman is cinematic gold, good looking, successful, intelligent and articulate. He's also a stone cold, calculating killer. For an 80s yuppie, that most loathsome of sets, he's oddly captivating, every bit the anti-hero. Narrating as he goes, Bale's voice sounding unnervingly like Easton Ellis... or maybe Easton Ellis sounds like Bale?... or Bateman! Anyway, perhaps it's the world in which he operates and it's depiction that makes this work so well. Hyper-stylised restaurants with pretentious names, minimal apartment layouts, the obsessing over business cards and Bateman's desire to fit in, but his competitiveness not allowing him to do so. This all provides a sleek clean surface for Bateman to cover in blood with devastating effect. He's annoyingly likeable... until he kills a homeless man and his dog. However on the flip side, minutes later, it's Huey time! Gleaming Axe, transparent raincoat and the idiot Jared Leto lured back to Bateman's apartment. Paul Allen (Leto) you see has upset Bateman. He has a better haircut, can get reservations at in vogue restaurant Dorsia, even has a better business card and mistakes him for someone else, as do several others. He's in trouble and it's not long until he's hacked to pieces as 'Hip to be Square' blasts out. This though might be his undoing as private detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe) is drafted in to find Allen and harass Bateman. He knows something's up, that unmistakable smile meeting Bateman's pouting frown, but their exchanges are more awkward than anything else. It's an odd film, no one is likeable to any degree, sexist Wall Street morons, drugged up socialites. Everyone is vile. There's very little thread to it either, aside Bateman's insecurities. Even the persistent detective feels like a nuisance sub plot to the killing spree. Ultimately it's Bateman's slip into more and more extreme and sadistic behaviour that drives this, with the sight of him running naked and blood splattered through the hallway with a chainsaw and him sweating profusely in designer suits as the minutes pass by being the more notable events. Bateman knows he's coming apart, but his lack of emotions confuse him. As he slides further it's difficult to get a grip if events are real or part of his deepening psychosis. It's chilling in it's pointlessness, but fantastic and makes me want to pick up the book again, but first... I have to return some videotapes.",American Psycho
177,bregund,As empty as the era it ridicules,2,23 February 2003,"This review contains spoilers.This movie doesn't know what it wants to be.  It's too serious to be a black comedy, too gruesome to be a comedy, too funny to be a drama, too narrow-mined to be satirical, and too broad to be a character study.  In short, American Psycho takes the middle road so often that the end result is a weak, ineffectual film that promises more than it delivers.Just in case you don't know that this film takes place in greed-driven 1980s (oh right, like the 1990s internet explosion had nothing to do with greed), gigantic cordless phones, 1980s music, power suits, whitewashed Malibu walls, and odd menu choices like `sea urchin ceviche' are jammed into your senses.  With all of these blatant era-placement devices, you just know that during the writing of the script someone must have quipped about `instant culture immersion via baseball bat.'  I'm surprised they didn't stick a Neiman poster on the wall.  By the way, why aren't any of the women actors wearing those huge shoulder pads that were so popular in the 1980s? 
Christian Bale, as the yuppie Patrick Bateman, is pretty good in this otherwise vapid film.  The men are broadly-painted cliches of the typical 1980s ivy-league archetype:  snotty and oily-haired, with mannerisms akin to those of car salesmen or insurance agents, engaged in a culture of their own that we as viewers are supposed to ridicule, not just because it is the 1980s but because they were born priveleged, have nicknames like `Biff', and will someday die not in a smelly hospital but in the comfort of their own home on a four-hundred-year-old poster bed attended to by a private nurse.Several things don't make sense:  when the prostitute ran screaming down the hall, pounding on doors, why didn't any of the residents open their doors? Why don't we ever see Bateman doing any work instead of just listening to music or going to lunch?  How could you kill someone with a nail gun?  And just what happened at the end, was Paul Allen alive or dead?  I don't understand this film at all.This film is as pretty and sterile as Patrick Bateman's condo, and, like much of the 1980s, offers little substance.",American Psycho

Bale's portrayal of a fascinating character is great, and the whole role is very memorable, among his finest in my opinion. The movie is an interesting take on society and ""normality"" and so close to the truth it's kinda scary.. Great as just a fun (black)comedy, but if you look more closely it can be so much more!",American Psycho
179,SKG-2,Biting yet chilling satire,8,20 April 2000,"WARNING: SOME SPOILERS AHEADI first read Ellis' novel a year ago.  While much of it was overwritten, particularly the gore parts, within it was a biting yet chilling satire, from the concentration of what Patrick wore to what he listened to(the record reviews, written with the same depth as one might expect a review of The Who's TOMMY would have, are hysterical), which exposed an entire empty sub-culture.  I'm glad director and co-writer(with Guinevere Turner, who also plays one of Patrick's victims) Mary Harron found that satire in her film, while playing down the gore(though the murders still retain their kick).  One could argue some of it is so 80's it's passe, but then again, given the way a new generation of people are driven to success at any cost, maybe it's not just the 80's.Bale does a good job of capturing Patrick, being both funny and terrifying, often at the same time, and yet showing that the person he most terrifies is himself.  The other actors are all good, particularly Chloe Sevigny as Patrick's secretary, and makes it believable that she's the one person he would spare.  A couple of points on what people have written; if the other characters seem shallow, that's partly because that's how Patrick sees them. Also, I don't think we're supposed to think he imagined it all; I think his friends just don't believe a serial killer may be in their midst(which is why Harron keeps Ellis' last line ""THIS IS NOT AN EXIT"" on the door behind Patrick).",American Psycho
180,dfle3,Fortunately not as horrific as the novel extract I read,6,19 June 2008,"Many years ago I read an extract in The Age newspaper of Bret Easton-Ellis' novel ""American psycho"". Didn't even manage to real all of it-I found it so absolutely vile I stopped reading it and knew that I would never read that book (the extract was the literary equivalent of coming across those photos from SBS TV autopsy shows in The Age-God knows why The Age feels that a TV guide needs shots of actual autopsies-again and again). The book then and now, presumably, requires it to be wrapped in a plain brown paper bag for taking away after purchase (as it's rated R).Anyway, the other night a commercial network here in Australia screened this movie around midnight. I PVR'd it and watched it soon afterwards. I'm assuming that it wasn't different to the cinema release.The plot: Christian Baile plays Patrick Bateman, a corporate high-flyer in the 1980's (with a touch of the Jim Carreys about him)- a time of corporate piracy and excess. He's about to get married, or so his girlfriend thinks and the petty jealousies at work fill him with such rage that he becomes quite the nasty psycho killer (Quest que cest?). This is the kind of slasher movie which has more in common with Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" than Carpenter's ""Halloween""-i.e. you get a fleshed out portrait of the murderer and not some automotan killing machine. As in those movies, it isn't really a gore-fest, though one or two scenes in it are not very pleasant-to do with dismemberment.Apparently the novel was a biting satire of the excess of the times.That does come across in this movie, though I wonder if the book itself says more about the rivalry between artists (Easton Ellis) and the corporate world he seems to despise-in other words, perhaps the sickness of the novel says more about artists as a class than supposedly bad corporate raiders.There are a couple of telling scenes in this movie where others precisely pigeon-hole Bateman and you know they've nailed his character.Bateman is a very odd character-stylised and amusing at times.",American Psycho
181,AKS-6,Clever adaptation of Ellis's novel,6,4 June 2000,"""American Psycho"" is a very clever adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's cult novel. There are very gruesome murders in the film, but you never get to see them which I am grateful for. The Patrick Bateman of this film (brilliantly portrayed by Christian Bale) is not the Bateman I imagined while reading the book, I don't know why, but the Bateman I saw before me was more cool and distanced. However, I like this Bateman better (as a character in a film/book, not as a personality) and Bale really brings something special to the part. Truly a great performance. Other than that, prepare to laugh a lot while watching the film. It's a satire and it's *very* funny. For example, Bateman's monologues about music before he kills and some very funny scenes involving business cards et cetera et cetera. However, it isn't a masterpiece and while it's a good film I still feel there's something missing. I don't know what, though, but I'll have to give ""American Psycho"" a 6 out of 10 = good.",American Psycho
182,estreet-eva,Ambiguity doesn't equal cleverness,4,1 September 2015,"American Psycho stars a Brit and is filmed largely in Toronto with much of the music provided by Englishmen (exclude for Huey Lewis who's golden retriever countenance and cheerfulness couldn't be much more American). Title aside the film based on the overrated novel plays out the idle fantasies of an unseen office-dwelling narrator named Patrick Bateman who imagines himself really, really, really, really, ridiculously good looking (as Derek Zoolander might say), wealthy without actually having to do any work, and with his greatest challenge securing reservations at popular NYC restaurants of the time. He also fantasizes about extreme sex and violence scenarios recording them in a notebook in his office. The book and movie try to leave this ambiguous mistaking having a definite ending for cleverness. Of course, others have their own interpretation of events but ultimately the movie is not sufficiently interesting to argue about. While it does handily provide an critique of 80's yuppie culture, that wealthy entitled lifestyle has always existed in prosperous Western cultures; in the 80's it just had a name. In short, for as much ink and outrage spilled about the film, you would think it would actually be more thought-provoking.",American Psycho

And the music, used in the background was great. After seeing this movie in the comfort of my home I can only say that it is a very confused movie. I didn't quite get it. The main reason why I liked it was Christian Bale, who could definitely pass for an American. With honors! But the ending of the movie is sort of disappointing and the movie altogether is short.

If you thought so, you got it all wrong and probably won't enjoy it as much as if you look at it as a comedy, which it is.A lot of this film and book was likely inspired by Vampire's Kiss, which has a lot of similarities. A guy whose reality isn't reality at all, or is it? Someone slowly losing their mind, or are they?Bale admitted to studying Nick Cage's performance in Vampire's Kiss and you can see why.

186,Flagrant-Baronessa,A brilliant modern day Gatsby,8,25 July 2006,"Novel adaptation ""American Psycho"" is a fiercely comical, graphic, dark, and relevant satire directing blunt social criticism toward the perverse materialism in America in the 1980s, the soullessness of rich people and the lack of individualism among an entire generation of yuppies. Think it's too much to take? It isn't, as the film balances its dark themes with huge doses of well-placed comedy. We follow Patrick Bateman, superbly acted by Christian Bale, as a well-to-do Wall Street worker, Harvard graduate and killer sociopath at night.Director Mary Harron has bravely steered American Psycho away from a slasher horror path and zooms in more on the psyche of Patrick Bateman and his hatred for other people which for the most part is covered in a mask of sanity but which sometimes slips out and results in gory killing sprees in his apartment.American Psycho is an elegantly crafted thriller, making great use of high-praised art, vulgar fashion trends, refined decoration, luxurious food and expensive New York living -- all to illustrate the materialism of our time. This makes Patrick Bateman something of a modern day Gatsby, but with a morbid twist and complete lack of morals. This is a modern masterpiece, if faintly flawed -- mostly because it does not leave much feeling. The entire film is very detached since we follow a cruel, emotionless anti-hero and pointing to the hollowness of an entire generation, the film itself becomes a bit hollow.8/10",American Psycho

I only watched about 1/2 this movie before I shut it off because I was falling asleep. Patrick Bateman is such an idiot, he tries to be all sophisticated yet evil at the same time, but he fails miserably. He's trying to copy Hannibal Lecter but sucking at it. You could tell from the start that he's evil, he says it about 50 times. And he always says ""Im gonna kill you"". Thats really subtle. He does NOT have the style of killing that Hannibal Lecter does either, Lecter kills people in unique, interesting, and sneaky ways. Bateman does it so blatantly. His first victim is a homeless guy and his dog. He sits there and taunts a homeless guy, then stabs him. Then his dog barks at him so he stomps the poor thing to death. What kind of wuss is he? Can he not fight someone face-to-face? His second victim is a co-worker. But, he gets him drunk first. Then covers the furniture and carpet of his house and invites him over. They talk for 10 minutes then he hits him while off guard with an axe. I could tell for 10 minutes that he was going to kill him, hes not sneaky at all. Then...I guess I dozed off.

192,avik-basu1889,The man behind the mask !!!,9,2 June 2015,"It is very difficult to pinpoint the genre that American Psycho belongs to. It can be called a horror film, a psychological thriller, a social commentary, a strange character study, a film- noir thriller,a black comedy,etc. But no matter what you call it, it certainly is one thing and that is disturbing. Christian Bale takes off the facial masque at the beginning of the film and what follows is utterly disturbing and gruesome.The film is based on the novel of the same name written by Bret Easton Ellis and it is set in the 1980s. The primary theme of the storyline is to underline in an exaggerated way how some people belonging to the elite upper class of society get driven by greed, lust for power, materialism and uncontrolled ambition to the point where they almost lose their humanity completely. In order to justify and validate the impression that they want others to have of them and they have of themselves, they go to absolutely disturbing lengths and violate other people. But all this wouldn't have worked had the film not been a great character study and had the film not involved a fascinating performance by Christian Bale playing the role of Patrick Bateman. We see that Bateman is not only trying to hide his true self from others but also from his own self. Thus in order to convince himself that he is better than others and not inferior in any way and also to hide his true nature from himself, Bateman treats others in the most disturbing manner possible.This is without a doubt, one of the best performances in Christian Bale's career. He manages to expertly portray both sides of the character of Bateman. He is on one hand extremely suave and debonair looking, but on the other hand also manages to bring the requisite amount of violence and ruthlessness in his performances. His facial expressions change very quickly and viciously all the time to accentuate the fact that his character is always pretending to be one thing or the other in front of everyone else. Some of his screams and gestures in the film will make the sensitive viewers have nightmares.The film has a very dreamy look and feel about it in a noirish sense. The director Mary Harron manages to conjure black comedy in the midst of all the madness for which the adapted screenplay and original novel also have to be admired. She also manages to end the film in a very artistically ambiguous manner. She asks the viewer to make his/her mind up about what really happened and leaves the door open for multiple interpretations. American Psycho is a socially relevant film as well as a disturbing character study. The direction is very good and the central performance is fascinating. This is the kind of film that continues to linger in your thoughts after it ends and is extremely conducive for retrospective analysis.",American Psycho

Bale played his part to perfection and is truly a career highlight for him. To some odd degree, you root for him. He is not a good person but with the restraint he shows it displays a little bit of human inside of him giving more depth to him that people usually give him credit for. Honestly, I feel Bale should have won an Oscar for his performance but that may just be me. The plot is so simple yet also enthralling and gripping. It delivers so many conflicting ideas; you want the cops you catch him yet you also want him to escape. The ending is also great although a tad bit confusing. You learn something new with every watch.Bad: I know their job is to support Bale but the characters surrounding Bale aren't interesting and just feel useless and their acting is sub- par. The more slow and boring parts, such as the drugs, can drag and feel like a time waster. Not to say I hated them all, I enjoyed the meeting with the pointles private detective and the humorous exchange of business cards.

195,paulcreeden,Movie or audience?,7,21 April 2000,"I think ""American Psycho"" will succeed because repeat viewers will go to the film to watch premier viewers for their reactions to the shocks, ranging from loud and clear racism, sexism, homophobia and oozing violence. This is a phenomenon familiar to fans of the ""Halloween"" genre. My showing began with a young 20-something couple walking out after the characters made some nasty remarks about a Jewish colleague.

They might have needed resuscitation if they had stayed.)Actually, after observing the many under-30's at the showing I attended, I understood that the dark humor about 1980's Manhattan was wasted on them. They seemed to react to the graphic violence, but they did not laugh at all. Perhaps these times are too similar for them to those in the film?I lived in Manhattan during the period of the movie. I was frequently embarrassed by my own lonely laughter during the film. I was getting Ted Bundy looks myself after a while. It was worth the humiliation. I really did enjoy most of it.As a film, however, it seemed to get sloppy at its end. Without revealing any details, I would say that the film seemed to lose it edgy pace and meticulous style in its last ten or fifteen minutes. I will recommend the film very carefully to certain friends.",American Psycho
196,Rammstein-2,My mind goes blank (spoiler warning!),5,30 May 2000,"I didn't feel anything when I saw this film. The book made me disgusted, furious, had me laughing and nodding in consent with the clever insights into the idiotic life of Patrick Bateman. This film had nothing of it, and it although it was a good movie, it's far from being anything more than average.I won't say that I miss the endless torture-scenes of the book, it was clear right away that those were not possible to show to ANY extent. The mere suggestion of them and the notebook that Jean flips through near the end are enough to make one understand just how sick this person is. And Bates' performance is just excellent, perfect - he masters this role like none other. Just look at him phoning his lawyer: ""I just have to kill a lot of people!"" Brilliant.But the blandness of this film is on another level: the director just fails to convey the sentiment of total detachment that Bateman feels. He interacts with people, talks to them and even feels something for them, as in the case of his girlfriend, whom he dumps so that he won't harm her. All this is okay, for he wouldn't pass for a normal human being if he didn't. He leads two lives. His ""normal"" life is okay, well portrayed, and the moments where his second life, that of the blood-thirsty maniac, tries to grab hold of his sanity, are well made.But there is still something missing. And I can't really tell what. All I can say is that this film didn't make me feel what I thought I would feel: these people exist. There are people like Bateman, surely - but the film makes him unique.So go see it, for all that it matters. But I'd much rather read the book.",American Psycho
197,cat_ranchero,Excellence from Bale...,8,3 March 2013,"First off, Christian Bale is totally excellent in this part; because I've seen all the Batman films before seeing this, it came as a bit of a culture shock to see him in this particular role. But he carries it off brilliantly! I love the way his character's narration overlay's the images and the musical references are worked in so well. It's a really well made film too with a pretentious cuisine and big chunky telephones taking us back to the 80's. Having not read the book I did find some of it a little hard to follow, but I'll add it to the reading list and give this one another look afterwards. Definitely worth a look though, if just for Bale's performance.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",American Psycho

The story is known...a great businessman Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) lives a double life : at office he's the arrogant businessman who cares about the design of his visitcards but outside he is a serial killer (prostitutes are his fave targets) and his life that is dominated by designers and extreme care for the way you look like, but he also is addicted to pornmovies and yuppiemusic (before he starts killing someone, he first reviews a cd...all yuppiemusic like Whitney Houston, Genesis and Huey Lewis And The News). We all know our Patrick Batemans in our world (perhaps your manager huh?) and Christian Bale plays his role in a perfect way, you just hate him from the early start and you just hope he'll be caught as soon as possible, perhaps it's jealousy. The film itself is filmed like the decors Bateman lives in, all pretty cold and no real depth (the kind of yuppies who pretend to be it while their life is just one bulb), never that violent (except the images afterwards) and tons of sex...and for oldies like us, great songs from the eighties!

205,fciocca,"A movie ahead of its time, with a meaningful and really deep message, that applies very well to modern society.",8,18 September 2021,"Due to the recent rise of popularity on the internet of ""American Psycho"", I decided to finally watch it, and I was pleasantly surprised. I was not expecting such a deep and realistic depiction of our modern society. For sure this movie was ahead of its time, and it took years before getting noticed.First of all I had to approach this film with the right mentality: I needed to go beyond what I was watching on screen and understand the message underneath all this apparent nonsensical and over the top violence. Bateman is the pure representation of a person that, despite being already successful and lucky, wants more. As he says he wants ""to fit in"" in a world where clearly does not belong. He started to feel envy and hate for colleagues that achieved more than him. This will quickly escalate in a burst of violence that will cause several victims. This is exactly the metaphor of what is happening nowadays with people chasing success, never satisfied by their goals. The killings are just an allegory: more and more people, estraniate themselves from reality, and they become mad, they are not able to separate what is real and concrete, from what is pure delusion. This is exactly what happens to Patrick Bateman, in his attempt to reach perfection. This kind of destructive mentality has so many bad effects on the character, that in the end he becomes crazy and starts to merge reality with ideas in his head. He feels bad about the whole situation, and I think that the detective represents the guilt of feeling this way towards other people.Christian Bale as always delivered an amazing and compelling interpretation. He managed to depict the fall into madness of Bateman. The guy was clearly dedicated to the role and he always has control over the scene. He managed to be creepy and funny at the same time. He gave life to a very interesting character that deserves to be studied deeply. Happy to see Willem Defoe, even if it was just for a few scenes. The cast is composed of good actors such as Matt Ross, Jared Leto and Bill Sage, who had a pretty decent acting career, with a handful of successful movies and TV shows in their curriculum.It is not an easy watch. There are in fact many graphic scenes, nothing too strong in my opinion, but some people may feel uncomfortable. Some dialogues would never happen if this movie was made today. There is misogyny, hate speech towards other people and animal violence. So, approach with discretion. I wish more commercial movies would push boundaries in this way nowadays and be shocking. Using violence in a smart way, and not just for the sake of being gruesome.",American Psycho
206,XxEthanHuntxX,A Perfect Screen Adaptation,9,18 August 2020,"A masterful adaptation of words to cinema by Mary Harron, this is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's 1991 novel that was set in the 1980s. Though at the time it was called sexist filth by some. Christian Bale's performance is brutally riveting, playing a man disconnected from reality, thats established subtly from the start through Bateman's skewed priorities, like valentino suits, thick business cards and dinner reservations. Defined by consumerism living in the language of ads and driven forward by consumption. And his point of view does not define objective reality, this is represented by his inflated ego, his psychosis and many other mental illnesses - presumably his narcissistic and borderline behaviour. The film is basically a black comedy, and a critique of male behaviour.There is many scenes that points towards that - it was all in Bateman's head. But in fact its meant to be ambiguous and the film isn't about that question, and not about murder either for that matter. American Psycho is about yuppie culture, the melding of identity and the craving to stand out from such a superficial homogenized society.Patrick Bateman tries like the rest to fit in, but lives a double life as a killer, but he's not the killer he think's he is. As he goes insane he cant distinguish fantasy from reality. His over the top chainsaw killings, may be an aestheticised elaboration on partial truths. Ultimately the film doesn't care, the bigger point of the movie's absurdity is that within his society Bateman is not the psycho at all, he's just one more normal guy amidst a horde of uncaring detached from reality secretly discontented American psychos.",American Psycho
207,smakawhat,"U care for no one in this film, and that's the idea",7,14 October 2000,"Bale plays ""Patrick Bateman"", an upbeat all-with-it corporate business man working in Wall Street in the mid late 80's.  Being the son of the companies owner, he is pretty much in a cushy position, high paid, surrounded by other yuppies, goes to upscale restaurants, spends time in his high scale Manhattan apartments, and shmoozes with all his other same yuppie friends.  The only difference between him and all the others, is that Patrick is a serial killer.There's one thing I can say about villains in movies, we all secretly want them to win.  Bale in the yuppie peak of the 80's is surrounded by fakes, and jerkoffs, and other sick kind, so Bale fits right in.  Since he is a serial killer, he has no emotions NONE, and he blends in so easily with all his normal yuppie compatriots.  This is what makes this film unique, in that it's more of a statement on what the era was like than on Bale's horrible obsessions.Bale's acting is amazing in this role, playing such a complicated character. The murder scenes are filled with such tension, and the idea of chopping someone up into pieces whiles doing a soliloquy of why Huey Lewis's songs and music is so influential (which Bale's does as he usual waxes nostagicaly about 80's music while he's about to pounce on his victims) was just unreal.Interesting twist in the end as well.  However, there is only one interesting character in this film and everyone else is pretty plastic and uninteresting.  But I suppose that's the idea, thus making us feel no sympathy for any of these yuppie scums.Rating 7 out of 10",American Psycho

I guess if you are powerful, at least in this movie, you can get out of about any trouble.A really dark movie. Its strange, funny, and interesting all at the same time.

209,PeterRoeder,Fairly good adaptation,7,30 November 2009,"I just saw this yesterday. I think Christian Bale is a great actor also in Equilibrium and Batman, and he really does a good job playing Patrick Bateman. Anyway, having also recently read the book, I don't think it did a fair job to the book. Anyway, that is impossible. It is like the adaptation of Watchmen. Simply impossible, so why even try? Nevertheless, both the Watchmen movie and the American Psycho movie has turned out to be rather interesting. A weak aspect of the American Psycho movie was that some of the interesting dialogue was cut out. For example, Ted Bundy's name is mentioned in the book but left out in the movie. It would have been powerful to hear Ted Bundy's name spoken out in the movie, since the Bateman character is incredibly much inspired by Ted Bundy's story. Actually, it is amazing what a genius Breat Easton Ellis is. He is like a living Dostoyevski. His psychological insight into the Bateman character is incredible, and naturally this is impossible to bring to the big screen.",American Psycho

211,Silverzero,"Clever, witty sub-slasher which explores the perils of obsession, fantasy and reality.",10,30 August 2002,"American Psycho is an excellent adaption of an excellent book. It really couldn't be better. It doesn't try to be a comedy but some of the scenes manage to be very funny. (The Paul Allen murder scene is a riot.)Christian Bale's portrayal of a self-obsessed, jealous, competitive man, Patrick Bateman, is excellent and Oscar worthy. Willem Dafoe could have been used more but does well for his small part and it's a change to see him playing a good guy. It's good to see Jared Leto break away from teen-movies onto more serious roles and is terrific as the intelligent, but stupid Paul Allen. Chloe Sevigny gives a very humane performance as Bateman's secretary, Jean. Reese Witherspoon is disappointing as the bitchy character (which she always plays) Evelyn. That concludes the acting.The most unexpected thing about the film is the way it toned down on the books violence and capitalised on the books humour. Many of the lines that the characters deliver are effortlessly amusing. Bateman seems to always say, `I have to return some video-tapes' to get out of a sticky situation. `We saw a musical. O Africa Brave Africa It was a riot'. `I'm trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape, but my fiancée Evelyn keeps buzzing in my ear'. The way it pokes fun at wealthy snobs (Stash, even though he was a mute, was hilarious). I liked the way Bateman waffled on about Huey Lewis and The News before decapitating someone. Or Whitney Houston while 2 lesbians make out like there's no tomorrow. Watch out for the scene with the business cards.The film has a very confusing ending, which isn't exactly justified.

It is outrageously entertaining and an excellent film. Not as true to the book as one may expect, but if it was it would probably be banned.

1. Christian Bale (Patrick Bateman) delivers a great performance.
2. The humour, though slightly ridiculous in nature, never feels distracting and it always lands.
3. The costume design, although largely simple, is perfectly elegant and encapsulates the wealthy back-drop nicely.
4. Willem Dafoe (Donald Kimball), Jared Leto (Paul Allen), and Justin Theroux (Timothy Bryce) give stellar side performances.
5. The score does a fantastic job at adding to the comedy moments, whilst also cementing the gritty scenes.
6. The violence is brutal, impactful, and highly memorable - especially the scene involving Paul Allen, or the naked chainsaw run.
7. Patrick Bateman's slow descent into madness is both captivating, and mostly well-done.
8. The subtle critique of the rich and their lifestyles is never overpowering, as well as being deftly handled.Cons:
1. The decline into insanity for Patrick Bateman feels a little rushed, and could have been examined more in-depth.",American Psycho
214,Jacques98,"Eh, whatever, let me go get some pizza. Did you do the laundry?",1,2 November 2008,"If there is a single movie that suffuses as the poster-child for the countless ""What was the point of that?"" movies, it's American Psycho. It's not necessary bad, it's just boring and pointless. It's the kind of movie that will leave the average person thinking about their laundry when the credits roll rather than the movie itself. In other blunter words, the movie is wholesale forgettable from opening to closing. If you know anything about real-life serial killers, or have seen any other cliché serial killer movie, you've seen this. Hundreds of times.It opens up just like every other first-person narrative movie, and some lines even made me wonder if they were copied directly from Fight Club. Regardless of when the two original novels were written, I think this just proves the insane unoriginality of both.Speaking of unoriginality, American Psycho is nothing but one long, bloated serial killer cliché with nothing to differentiate it from the countless others just like it. The main character is a mix of Hannibal Lector and your average no-name B-movie serial killer. He does exactly what every other serial killer ever does: kill, have sex, and kill having sex. He's a dull cliché with legs. (And a butt, if you want me to mention the constant immature use of rear nudity that has no point but to make the 13-year-old girls horny.) There is no real plot, just, as I said, kill and have sex, and that's the ""brilliant, masterful"" plotting that everyone is speaking of. Kill, sex, kill, sexI think we know what sells in America. That's why American Psycho is just so safe. It's a safe idea that has been used hundreds of timeskill, sexand was destine to get great reviews because it plays so safe. I think we've learned by now that safe movies get the critic's good scores, and safe movies sell. Am I really the only one who gets it? American Psycho is a movie for safe pansies who's idea of a ""brilliant, masterful"" plot is: kill, sex, kill.But with all the killing, I was left wondering: where is all this gore everyone is speaking of? How is this gory? Every single kill is off-screen. I've seen low-budget 60's horror movies that show more gore on screen. There isn't a single moment of brutality. There is less blood on screen than your average TV show. Did I mention this movie plays it all 100% safe? If everything I just mentioned wasn't bad enough, let me move on to the boring factor. The entire run time is a long, drawn-out talking scene. It goes from one conversation scene to another, with less action than your average drama. Maybe that's because, no matter what you want to believe, American Psycho is a drama. It isn't a horror moviejust the idea of typing that makes me laughand it isn't an action movie. It's just a cliché, dull drama.The only good I can manage to scrounger up: - Bale knows how to act. - The chainsaw scene was interesting.Now, back to the bad for my conclusion. American Psycho is a safe, boring, cliché drama and nothing more. It has some humor, but it's all humor you've heard before. There is no intellectual meaning, unlike what some seem to think, and it isn't entertaining. It's so forgettable the exact thing I thought when the credits came on screen was: ""I need to order some pizza . . ."" and didn't even remember I watched it until I sat down to write this review the next morning. There are countless movies out there exactly like this, and I sometimes wonder if I'm the only person alive who even gets that there actually ARE interesting, entertaining, original movies out there to watch. Why did I waste my time on American Psycho? 0/10",American Psycho

216,luke-a-mcgowan,A masterpiece for Mary Herron and Christian Bale,10,4 February 2016,"There aren't many movies this bizarre that I would consider masterpieces, but Mary Herron's American Psycho (yes, a woman directed this!) deserves no lesser title. It would be disrespectful to the hugely talented women behind the camera to say that the film is all about Christian Bale, but he deserves a huge amount of its praise. Bateman is a flat-out psychopath but never feels overacted. Bale is completely at home in Bateman's skin, whether he is displaying gross levels of narcissism, ranting like a maniac or just walking around bearing a grim scowl. The accent that Bale chooses for Bateman is inspired; generic and mellow yet bubbling with madness. The way a smile slides straight from Bateman's face conveys that he does indeed only feel disgust and greed. He's wildly funny and yet greatly horrifying. The perfect anti-hero.American Psycho is so much more than a well-acted black comedy, and that is thanks to the incredible direction of Mary Herron (who has done nothing of note since and has so much to offer!) along with the script she co-wrote with Guinevere Taylor adapted from the Bret Easton Ellis book. American Psycho is a commentary on corporate America, where everyone is the same and no one stands out but everyone seems to think that they do. This is best seen in the business card scene, as well as a less famous and openly funny scene in which men are all doing cocaine in the toilet cubicles and yet shouting at each other for bothering their private business. Characters note slight differences from each other that are not objectively apparent to audience members whilst flat out ignoring similarities. Bateman's instructions to really listen to the music ""It's Hip to Be Square"" are just as much for the audience - the world says that it is great to be uninteresting and fit in.The script adds more layers in commentary on what rich people are like. Devilishly scripted scenes such as corporate idiots trying to sound smart talking about world issues - ""don't you know about Sri Lanka? The Sikhs are killing like a tonne of Israelis over there"" - are as much a commentary as that listed above. Bateman and the other corporates are constantly trying to impress people with their connections, ability to book last minute restaurants, and social status. The casting of Reese Witherspoon as Bateman's glamorous fiancé whom he utterly despises contributes perfectly to this aspect of the film, a stark contrast to the unglamorous Chloe Sevigny and Cara Seymour.Many can get through the first viewing of American Psycho and be pleasantly entertained by wacky and hilarious moments. But the loose grip on reality is what might turn some off. The last 20 minutes is almost impossible to follow unless you have decided on an interpretation. I interpret the film as being fantasies in Bateman's head, all the murders simply being doodles on his compendium (as he is never seen actually doing work). Mary Herron's brilliant direction never favours one interpretation over the other, rather she shades the film from every angle (see the splicing of Willem Dafoe's suspicious scenes with his friendly scenes, representing Bateman's lack of connection to reality).American Psycho is sheer brilliance. It is daring and not enough film are like this. A wildly funny what-is-happening black comedy on the surface, Psycho has so many layers and mysteries that it not only warrants repeat viewings, it deserves them.",American Psycho
217,bazookamouth-221-898097,Christian Bale acting masterclass,8,19 September 2018,"A brief adaptation of the book is a comic turn, and partly because the serial killer has become one of the cinema's stock characters this past decade. Bateman was clearly named to echo America's most famous movie psycho, Norman Bates, but the characters he most resembles are those more recent sociopathic figures fleeing from or attracted to the upper middle-class high life played by Edward Norton in Fight Club, Jude Law and Matt Damon in The Talented Mr Ripley, and Kevin Spacey in American Beauty.

As some of the most memorable lines that a psychopath could ever utter.

223,noahgibbobaker,Not exactly what it seems.,8,10 September 2020,"To me, american psycho is not about murder, it is about the superficial culture of wall street in the 1980's. I think this message is still relevant today as wall street is still as materialistic and superficial as ever.I think Bateman's identity is purposefully left ambiguous as everyone on wall street just blends together, they all want the same thing, to be a stereotypical successful man. This lack of individuality is something Bateman doesn't want to be a part of, he wants to be seen as a killer, he wants to be seen as anything other than everyone else. Patrick hates the void of personality on wall street on some level but ultimately still indulges in it. He uses women only for pleasure and nothing else, he always tells people about his material belongings, sometimes complete strangers and is just like the people who surround him.I believe that scenes when Bateman murder are hallucinations, he uses a chainsaw that nobody seems to hear and then drops it onto someone from the top to a staircase to kill them. He also uses a gun with perfect accuracy without any training and makes two police cars explode with it. I believe that Bateman is actually Davis. Bateman is Davis' desperate attempt to separate himself from yuppie culture, but by doing this he, eventually, is unable to determine fantasy from reality.Even though I think Patrick Bateman is a hilusination I still think american psycho is a great character study of him. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is extremely realistically and respectfully depicted along with narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. I love the way this film puts you in the head of such a confused and dangerous person. I think that too many filmmakers more recently are scared of doing something that questions the viewers' morales and makes them actually think about what they are seeing.Most of problems lie with the technical elements. I thought the cinematography was good but nothing to write home, in fact I thought most of the technical elements were not very special. Some of my issue could be down to this film being made in 2000, for example the greenscreen, when used, wasn't great.American psycho is one of the best films of the 2000's. Go see it.",American Psycho
224,Cedric_Catsuits,Rubbish,1,21 August 2013,"Utter rubbish. Confusing and dreary. Bale's performance is so OTT I couldn't figure out if he is trying to be funny, or just ridicule the story. I had no idea what was going on, or who any of the characters were.Mostly the movie is boring and nothing happens, and when something does happen it seems to be thrown in willy-nilly to change the pace. It's disjointed and muddled and for the most part mind-numbingly dull.Frankly I'm shocked at how bad it is, considering the number of established performers. If ever there was a movie that shows the difference in mentality between actors and normal people, this is it.

226,tburke85,American Psycho A Twisted Well Made Thriller,8,5 June 2009,"American Psycho is a twisted very well made thriller with a knock out performance by Christian Bale from Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Prestige, and most recently Terminator Salvation. The rest of the cast including William Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chloe Sevigny, Josh Lucas, Samantha Mathis, and Reese Witherspoon in a small role turn in good performances but it's Bale who stands out amongst them. I won't say anything about the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet except that American Psycho is a thriller with some touches of dark humor powered by a great performance by Christian Bale as a wealthy New York banking executive with a taste for homicidal activities. The movie is definitely weird and different but in a good way. Director Mary Harron does a good job of bringing this film to the big screen and doing justice to the book. Well done. The film does contain strong violence, some graphic sex scenes, drug use, and strong language so parents should be warned before watching this with their kids. Overall American Psycho was much better that expected and most of that is because of the fantastic performance by Christian Bale who continues to show Hollywood why he's one of Hollywoods best actors. If you're in the mood to watch a good movie that's entertaining, different, and with some dark humor you can't go wrong with American Psycho. It's one movie among many that will not disappoint.",American Psycho

228,Aly200,An Interesting Look into the Dark Side of Yuppie Culture,7,7 February 2017,"Based on the controversial bestselling novel by Bret Easton Ellis, this terrifying film remains a constantly debated masterpiece of early 21st century cinema. A notable first for the film's success being directed by a woman and secondly for the intense and insane performance by Christian Bale as the titular psycho, it is sometimes difficult to remember why the film has a bit of a cult following.There is so much to say about the bravado performance of Christian Bale in the pivotal role of Patrick Bateman, an arrogant and unstable Wall Street broker, but also difficult to describe the insanity that ensues. While A- list star Leonardo DiCaprio was the first choice for the part, the actor passed on the dark subject matter and the previously fired (the filmmakers weren't convinced that the little known Christian was right for the part) Bale was called back to take over the role he had lost out on. Channeling charisma equivalent to acting superstar Tom Cruise (Bale and other crew members stated in interviews that he did model his look for Bateman on the A-list star) while masking a wicked secret, Bale keeps himself restrained as much as possible until the madness suddenly erupts like a volcano. Take for instance the infamous ax murder to the song 'Hip to Be Square' by Huey Lewis and the News, where Bale is as calm and friendly as can be until he unleashes his hatred for Jared Leto's Paul Allen in a gleefully maniacal rage and hacks the character to death. The madness only escalates as Bale's Bateman falls even further into insanity, but is he really a homicidal maniac or is he a delusional madman?The film boasts a stellar supporting cast of players who all play unique parts within the narrative. Aforementioned future Oscar winner Jared Leto is Paul Allen, a fellow broker and the first victim of Bateman's wickedness to harm his fellow man, Samantha Mathis as an ill-fated friend of Bateman's, Willem Dafoe as a FBI man who is looking into the fate of Leto's Paul Allen, Chloe Sevigny as Patrick's compassionate secretary who finds out what a monster Bateman might be and future Oscar winning actress Reese Witherspoon is Bateman's clueless and wealth-obsessed fiancé. Under the careful direction of Mary Harron, the film maintains an ambiguity that is needed for the narrative. We see everything through Patrick Bateman's eyes, which provides us with an unreliable narrator. Given that we do see his heinous crimes as he commits them, we are inclined to believe that Patrick has been telling us the truth, but when the film's ending hits we the audience are thrown for a loop. Was everything real, did the murders actually or was it the confessions of a mentally unstable lunatic? The question is left unanswered and lingering in our minds after the credits roll. The movie does eliminate some of the book's more horrific elements like the implication of cannibalism and some of the on-screen violence is also toned down, but still maintains terror and gruesome content without being too nauseating. There is also some disturbing scenes of sexual content mixed with violence which is deeply unsettling. This is not a film for the sensitive viewers. Don't watch if you have a weak stomach or dislike a black comedy horror picture.",American Psycho
229,zmaturin,Psych-o-liscious!,10,3 May 2000,"[This review has a few minor spoilers]I'll admit it: I'm a sucker for any movie with chainsaw. Be it Ash or Leatherface, give the lead a buzz saw to chase down their adversaries, and I'm happy. That's why it was so great to see Patrick Bateman, this movie's titular psycho, running down a hallway, naked, chasing a screaming woman and clutching a roaring chainsaw.Patrick also watches ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" while working out, executes people while discussing the finer points of Phil Collins, and will kill anyone with a nicer business card than his. In short, he's the best horror character in years, which is why it's sad that this movie shies away from true horror, because I thought it was near perfect.Well, that's not true- I didn't like the ending (although it leaves the door open for a sequel, which I would be in favor of) and some parts are a little slow, but overall this movie is an excellent look at what it's like to loose one's mind. The whole 1980s setting attempts to make this movie into a parody of the greedy ""me""-decade, but what really shined through for me is Bateman's ever-growing fear and hatred of people, a feeling I'm sure more than one viewer will associate with, which will make it all the more disturbing when Bateman turns murderer.Christian Bale is beyond perfect as the homicidal maniac who fits in with his upper crust friends and coworkers so well that he becomes invisible. The supporting cast is adequate, but all seem subdued and ""turned down"" compared to Bale's tour-de-force performance.",American Psycho

It's extremely well done, has a pretty clever script, some fantastic performances (hello, Christian Bale), and, what make the movie some awesome ambiguity that makes you think a lot after see it, because it has so many layers that is impossible to understand right away.All the issues that I had with the movie falls apart when I reach the conclusion that at least the majority of the thing does not happened, at least, not in that way that we saw in the movie, and this is fantastic, I thought about it, after saw the film, and I remembered some pieces of advices that the story give to us in order to say that this isn't necessarily true. The movie is fascinating, at the same time that it talks about the Psychos and all that these people thing, and feel (or not feel), it talks also about the ""american way of life"" the yuppie culture, and how much some people (or everyone) are everyday becoming more and more empty, apathetic, almost ""robots"" from the system. And I'm certainly that if I think more about it, I will find more and more symbolism.The tension in some moments really got me, I was apprehensive in many scenes, the soundtrack really helps it.In short, American Psycho is a smart and fascinating film, that tells a story that not everyone wants to talk about it.9,5/10",American Psycho

American Psycho is such a scary and disturbing film in many ways. It is one of those films that just ignores the Hollywood idea of having a nice rounded out ending that leaves no room for thought. American Psycho is just nothing like that, you will think one heck of a lot. Christen Bales performance is just amazing, he gives one of the best performances in years, he is just phenomenal. The other performances by actors like William Dafoe and Reese Witherspoon are also fine. The film is also admirably directed and written with great dialogue and characters. The visual effects are also great, everything looks real and is just amazing.

233,harrylosborne,"Quiet, understated brilliance in Bale's (re)breakout role",8,8 April 2019,"American Psycho is a genre-defining piece, if only for its quotability and warped outlook on the modern USA. Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) is the ultimate pseudo-horror character: precise, meticulous and superficially perfect. However, below this exterior, Bateman shows a twisted mind obsessed with murder and torture, a profile he struggles to hide throughout his everyday life. As the film progresses, the mannerisms of Bateman begin to make more and more sense - always calculated and disguised, but verging on being discovered for who he truly is.Bateman's interactions with his closest ""friends"" are the most fascinating to watch, as he pretends to buy into the high life of Manhattan purely to maintain his social image. Talking to his fiancee Evelyn (Reece Witherspoon) seems like an actual chore to Bateman, from which his only real reprieve is 80s music. Ultimately, you don't watch the film for the violence and the brief scenes of madness, but for the tightrope Bateman walks in living an everyday, affluent life.Overall, American Psycho is a cultish classic, but still offers a brilliant story of insanity through an antagonist's eyes, whilst being instantly memorable.",American Psycho
234,Mitch-38,A Perfect Allegory of American Greed & Mentality,9,21 December 2001,"*Caution-Some potential spoilers ahead* Rarely has a motion picture aimed to capture the essence of its subject, and succeed so well. Christian Bale in AMERICAN PYSCHO nails this one to the wall, if you'll pardon the expression.
The main focus is the opulent, orgiastic greed of the 1980's, although it could be any real place in present time, as well. Bale portrays Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street broker on the verge of going insane. Bateman's world of picture-perfect world of defoliating skin creams and two o'clock tanning appointments; hides the facade of a man who is not there, nothing, except for his continuing spiral into the abyss.The reality of his world, which really comes down to one-upsmanship among his cronies and his social circle; who don't listen or care about each other, anyway. The nothingness of it grows to the point Bateman cannot return, with hellish consequences for those unfortunate to be in his path.

235,GeoPierpont,Harken Back to the Olden Days of BlockBuster,7,22 March 2016,"If you ever coveted a copy of ""Dress for Success"" as your personal Bible or were captivated by a critical analysis of Whitney Houston or Huey Lewis's artistic efforts, this is a definitive moment captured on celluloid.Christian Bale of ""Little Women"" fame ascends a slight departure from the loving, kind, gentle soul but retains that ""I Want to Fit In!"" at any cost mentality in this role. I hailed all those many stereotypes, defiled in every scene and found the character hilarious.Yes, he felt trapped and subjected to lower life forms while comparing watermarks on business cards and the ability to obtain the rare reservation at the latest Phenom restaurant. Who wouldn't lose their mind in this shallow, chasing shadows, meaningless existence? Here, we have an exceptionally sensitive and caring soul who just cannot bear one more moment of the herd mentality and cracks under pressure.This was a divine commercial for Men's beauty products and regimen to achieve the look of perfection and charm. Such an erudite perspective of a clandestine approach to coping in the material world. Albeit, an unusual take that leaves one gasping for air, but perhaps for naught.An additional viewing to appropriately review this title is required, but taking chances never did anyone much harm hence, this effort. I found the direction remarkable and parlayed many layers of complexity beyond shallow characters. The color schemes, pacing, scene caressing and framing compiled the true stars of this show.High recommend for Christian fans, he is absolutely gorgeous, stunning, beautiful and full of promise. Jared Leto has an infinitesimal role yet memorable. Prepare for fantasy blood and gore and the pen-ultimate career of ""Murders and Executions"".",American Psycho
236,Brogan,Being A Serial Killer.,7,17 April 2000,"Patrick Bateman is a Wall Street yuppie who has a nice apartment, nice clothes, healthy body, a beautiful girlfriend, and a great paying executive job.  However, all is not normal for Patrick, you see, beneath those high quality assests, there's a monster that lives deep in Patrick's soul.  That monster is vicious and evil, it's the evil side that controls Patrick when he's upset and angry.  And then all hell breaks loose, blood is shed, and Patrick continues with his daily life. That is the premise behind the new Mary Harron film, AMERICAN PSYCHO. Patrick (Christian Bale) A everyday man, who is indeed successful, wealthy, and part of the elite society in the late 1980's.  But he releases his anger by taking care of his problems, which would include disembody a woman's head, chop a fellow co-worker into little pieces, and other horrific things.       PSYCHO is a intelligent satire of the late 1980's, where we were serious about the lifestyle, songs, and attitude that is protrayed in the film back in 1987.  Now we just laugh and are in disbelief on the way we acted and the music we listened to.  PSYCHO shows the strong conservative image that most Americans were living during Regan's power.  But it's the brilliant inside look at what one of these conservative's would be like if we took a look inside their life.      I was really looking forward to PSYCHO, I was hoping that it would be like a look inside the mind of a madman like Hannibal Lecter, or Travis Bickle.  But it's different, it doesn't really tell the viewer why Patrick kills.  Instead, it shows Patrick's daily life-style, which includes putting on tons of different beauty oils, excersising regularly, and tanning. But it shows that the psychos in our world are not the kind that live in the dark in urban American and have special kinds of moths with a skull on it.  No, it shows that the serial killer is not only the person that you know, but your best friend! The acting by Christian Bale is outstanding, he did quite a job by dropping his Limey accent for a pure Yank accent.  I love his speeches on certain 80's music, including Hewey Lewis, Phill Collins, and Whitney Houston.  The support is also good, Willem Dafoe is also good as a investigator looking for a missing person that Patrick might have killed.  Chloe Sevigny is also very good as the Patrick's administrative assistant who has a crush on Patrick.  And Reese Witherspoon is a typical snobby and stuck-up socialite who cares more about what will the wedding look like than the actual marriage. Mary Harron does a great job adapting the horrific novel (although I haven't read it yet), but with the story and pacing, it appears that she got the real reason to why we should watch this movie.  What I also enjoyed is the trickery that Harron uses in this film.  When the viewer thinks that they are seeing something, it's something totally different.  I always love it when a film director messes with the viewer's mind. Overall, I really did enjoy AMERICAN PSYCHO, but it does have it's bad points.  At times the movie goes from a fast pace to a bit slower.  And some of the character's are not explained fully in detail.  But those are just the side dishes compare to the rest of the film. But when you have a film where you have businessmen compare business card's to show their masculinity, it's sad but funny.  It's just a cruel way to show that while others care about their appearence, others are releasing their anger and taking out on others, with their blood.  This film is not really for the faint of heart.  It's not that gross, but it does leave a lot to the imagination, which is more gross. **** (out of five)",American Psycho

239,Christopher_Reid,"A twisted, bizarre and gory thriller",7,5 November 2020,"The weird thing about American Psycho is why anyone would create or watch such a movie (or book) in the first place. It's about a murderous psychopath with practically no redeeming qualities. Surely we should be repulsed and not want to see another second. But it's fascinating. It's obviously not meant to be taken literally. It works on a more abstract level.Like other movies around the turn of the 21st century - The Matrix, Office Space, Fight Club (all 1999) - American Psycho has a prominent theme of nihilism, especially in relation to consumerism and dull office work. That was in the zeitgeist at the time - a feeling of meaningless to many people's lives. Bates is like a manifestation of those feelings. Life is too dull. Only through killing, torturing and other depraved acts can he feel something. We may not turn to those things but the themes can resonate with us. It's like a dark fantasy.That's the other way it works. Many of us ask ""what if"". We'd never kill someone... but what if we did? Would we get away with it? There's something thrilling about seeing a main character commit murder and then have beads of sweat run down his temple as a detective asks him questions. We can't tell if Willem Dafoe has worked it out, in part because the director apparently got Dafoe to do multiple takes for every scene, some where he's suspicious, others where he's not, and then edited them together. It's not exactly deep or all that clever, but it creates a lot of tension and uncertainty.You keep watching, wondering where this is all going. What is this even about? The director is apparently a feminist so maybe it's about toxic masculinity or something. But women can be just as crazy, so this isn't really a male thing. Perhaps it's more about vanity and the kind of greedy people who end up succeeding on Wall Street. But again, that's more of a cliche than a reality. Successful business people often have to be personable and many of them are modest in their dress and belongings (super-rich directors like Spielberg and Lucas often wear jeans, for example).The end is a bit disappointing. It basically leads nowhere and leaves us confused as to whether the events are real or not. Did he imagine the murders or did they happen? How can the detective not work it out, especially if there are tens of missing bodies? Why would such an insane and distraught confession be brushed off as a joke? One sequence appears to be clearly dreamt where Bates somehow blows up a police car with a gun (looking at the gun as confused as we are) and shoots several random people with various witnesses.There's no punchline unfortunately. It's oddly engaging. There's quite a bit of attention to random details, like business cards and trivia about hit albums. Bale's performance is committed - he doesn't seem to care what people think about him, only about giving a good performance. His mastery over his own body and persona are clear here. There are themes of obsession and nihilism. But these pieces don't quite fit together. Ultimately, it's not realistic, nor does it convey some profound truth. It's just a gruesome thriller which draws you in and has a bit of food for thought.",American Psycho
240,RockPortReview,Dead on satire of the 80's blended in to horror/comedy!,10,6 February 2010,"American Psycho 02/02/2010American Psycho is based on the insanely gory and controversial book by Brett Easton Ellis. The author has had several of his books made into movies such as ""Less than Zero"", ""Rules of Attraction"", and 2009's ""The Informers"". American Psycho is a book some thought to be unfilmable, but writer and director Mary Harron brought the vile character of Patrick Bateman to life in movie that is more of a dark comedy than your average horror movie.Harron was also able to get such name actors as Reese Witherspoon, Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto. Not to mention Christian Bale, a largely unknown actor at the time, who landing the role of Patrick. Although Bale has been acting since the late 80's in such films as ""Newsies"" and ""Swing Kids"", it wasn't until ""Psycho"" that he really started to appear on people's radar. His performance was nothing short of spectacular. If you really want to see a shocking comparison of his work, watch ""The Machinist"" and ""Batman Begins"" back to back. Bale is a man fiercely loyal and committed to his craft.Set in the late 1980's New York financial district, American Psycho is a vicious satire on 80's materialism and extreme narcissism. Patrick Bateman is an investment banker for Pierce & Pierce, where everybody looks the same and it's all about how big your ego is. In an early scene we see Patrick, in his high rise apartment, go though his morning routine and in a voice over he says, ""There is an idea of a Patrick Batemen, but I'm simply not there"" If there is any emotion Patrick shows its greed and disgust. When his nightly blood lust starts to take over and he states ""my mask of sanity is about to slip."" He is sent over the edge by a business card. All the guys are showing off their new cards when colleague Paul Allen sends Patrick into a panic with a card that is better than his. This cannot stand and Paul eventually gets and axe to the face.To fill out the 80's vibe there is a lot of hit music played and talked about during some of most important scenes in the film. Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins and Whitney Houston to name a few.Reese Witherspoon has a small part as Evelyn, Patrick's so-called girlfriend, who is always badgering him to get married. Patrick really couldn't care less about her and is only going out with her to ""fit in"". Besides he has a mistress named Courtney. Jean his secretary is the most down to earth and ""real"" person in the film and in Patrick's life. Jean agrees to dinner with him, but at his apartment he can't go through with killing her and tells her to leave. Although when it comes to prostitutes he has no problem killing them. In one of the most insanely crazy scenes I've ever seen, Patrick fully nude and covered in blood chases a prostitute through his apartment building with a chainsaw. Bale completely inhabits this role and is totally insane. The final third of the film shows that Patrick has completely lost it and bears his soul to his lawyer's answering machine. What happens the next morning really drives home the themes of the film. The novel is extremely explicit in the violence and gore, while the film mostly leaves it to your imagination. The real horror comes from the character of Patrick Bateman, who seems to channel Hannibal Lecter in some scenes. There was an absolutely dreadful sequel made in 2002. It didn't have any of the cast and crew from the original and is just pure trash. The original film made my list for best films of the decade for the 2000's and continues to be one of my personal favorite films.",American Psycho

Also, I was unsure of whether or not the main character was actually killing people or just imagining it. His name is Patrick Bateman - probably - but some doubt is supposed to be planted about that as well. But his secretary calls him by that name and other people seem to recognize him.

242,rhinocerosfive-1,it is the privilege of the self-important to debate trivia,8,28 January 2009,"My friend Dmitry thinks that Mary Harron is prejudiced against the male characters. Also Dmitry hates ""it was all a dream"" stories, of which he considers ""American Psycho"" one. He thinks the movie fails as tragedy and comedy, because there are no consequences for Patrick Bateman.Here's part of his letter to me regarding this film:""what's the point of the story? is it about a shark among sharks who has a touch of humanity which makes him hate himself and disagree with the world he lives in - then what's the sacrifice? or the tragedy? he leaves his fiancé and makes the false confession but it's not enough, dramatically. ed norton confesses to the police. then shoots himself in the mouth. that's sacrifice. the point of ""American Psycho"", i guess, is that he has no way to redeem himself and that's the tragedy. that would be fine if not for all the murders. and again, if they are in his head and he thinks they are real then he is not merely having a nervous breakdown (which he never really has) but he is psychotic and that's never dealt with. ""Following is a response I wrote him in 2007: Bateman is psychotic, which is all that is dealt with, in my opinion. Start with the title. And the fact that everything he does is nuts. Even his friends kind of think he's weird, and they're barely awake enough to recognize him. He is Tantalus, staring at his own reflection and failing to grasp it until he goes mad with coveting himself.The joke of this story, I think, is a man trying desperately to have a tragedy, or a comedy, or any kind of a dramatic life, but he's just a doofus who happens to be very rich. He's Bruce Wayne without a good idea in his head. He's unable to really have, for instance, a sense of accomplishment, or a need unfulfilled, or a sense of loss, or values, really - since he's at the very, very top of Olympus, having achieved the top 2% of the planet in terms of resources (women and $100 plates and blow and limousines), he should be able to be happy. BUT THERE IS NO DRAMA IN HAVING EVERYTHING. So that's the comic premise: he can't have a tragedy, and he is driven mad by the attempt. The tragedy would be ""A Clockwork Orange"", a man so blasé and jaded that he follows the baser impulses of popular culture because it really doesn't matter what he does since society's such wreckage anyway, and whose real tragedy is that he actually can fulfill himself and be happy by doing evil, a more cynical sensibility than I think is found in ""American Psycho"".At this point, I think there are two valid ways to look at what constitutes the story.One is that he hasn't really committed these murders which should be horrific but aren't, and that he's having a nervous breakdown from trying so hard to transgress and being so impotent that his sex fantasies have become indistinguishable in his retarded mind from his real life. His fantasies, also, are not enough to make his life interesting; fantasies never are; and he is just an empty Lord & Taylor bag that a homeless man is using for a pillow. His friends see this, aren't interested enough to pity him, or, worse, think his confession is just a joke that they don't really get, so they kind of laugh along until their feelings are hurt. In trying to suffer punishment he only receives minor scorn. He is such a failure, a cipher, that even his crimes don't really exist. This is an okay interpretation, but less interesting than: The other way you could look at it, which is that he's so desperate for passion and fulfillment that, like Hercules, he really did commit these crimes, but that AGAIN THERE ARE ZERO CONSEQUENCES. When he confesses and nobody believes him, and even when his friends offer evidence to the contrary, that's just because they're as stupid as he is, and that they mistook him for someone else and also mistook his victim for someone else and they're all interchangeable anyway, and that it's just too much trouble for these people even to help the detective find the murderer, since nobody really liked Paul Allen in the first place. Anyway they're all self-absorbed and inattentive to really important details, not like ""which restaurant shall we go to,"" which is a minor detail that's very important to them, but big details like ""who am I talking to?"" I think this is the funnier interpretation, and I think that the movie ends on enough of an ambiguous note to allow for it.It is an imperfect film. It has great performances, many great scenes, a few very nice recurring themes, and many flaws. The disappearing detective is as you point out a problem. There is contempt in the lens, which I agree is to no one's advantage. I think we should see the guys hanging out more, see more of what pathetic losers they are, or more of how he's more or less screwed up than they. There is too much time spent with the character alone. To really get Travis Bickle's alienation, we don't only show him alone in his apartment playing G. Gordon and writing cryptic messages to himself. We show him at the movies.But man, Christian Bale on the phone, talking to that answering machine. So beautiful. We are capable of so much, we humans.

He grooms himself with skin lotions, and likes to look his best. But he is not satisfied, because he likes to kill people. An old tramp, prostitutes, and a fellow worker(or does he?) The film is laden with little clues, and the ending makes you think. Bateman can't hide his guilt, but nobody seems interested that he kills people. It is a satire on the eighties, including some good music from that decade, Bateman giving us some info on his favorite artists of the time. There are not many graphic scenes, but one where Bateman is running after a hooker in his apartment with a chainsaw stands out. Christian Bale is perfect as Bateman, suave and softly spoken, and believable as the deranged killer. It's also darkly amusing. One to watch.",American Psycho
244,datorsiers2,When you have it all.,9,30 November 2014,"American Psycho is a unique movie, since it can not be fully explained and understood. Christian Bale is just awesome in this movie as he keeps a cool head for the most of the movie and the his commenting on music is just hilarious. The movie really shows what a person can become when they have it all, Patrick Bateman had it all, a well-paid job, an expensive apartment, a good looking girl, all the drugs he wanted, which eventually led him to being insane, in his insanity he thought he was killing people, that can be understood from the parts where he walks around the town and blows up police cars and still gets completely unnoticed, the incident with a cat just tops it and viewers can sort of understand that none of the killings really took place, since Patrick had gone insane. This was not meant to be a slasher movie by any means, if anyone wants to see dozens of killings this is not really a movie to see then, this movie is more about understanding the story of a crazy psychopath, who has it all, but still is envious of every little thing, somebody else has,which leads to him killing everybody in his mind for his own amusement.",American Psycho

The movie is visually stunning and contains moments of brilliance but for many of its 98 minutes it's bullshit in the finest pop art tradition. Perhaps some insightful frustrated alpha males can see more but most will come away wondering what it was all about.6/10 worth watching",American Psycho

I thought the whole thing was just a silly, sick attempt at filmmaking.  But a couple of weeks ago, it was on cable and I watched it again and realized how great it is.  The ending really confused me the first time, but then i realized that the fiasco in the end didn't really happen.  This is a good film, and its VERY funny.  Christian Bale is phenomenal as Patrick Bateman, and it is not hard to see yourself in his shoes, no matter where you work.",American Psycho
247,Tiger_Mark,Is this really happening?,10,16 August 2001,"What a brilliant film! I read the book and had serious questions over whether it could be pulled off on the big screen, but it sure was. The key to this movie was the casting of Patrick Bateman. I had heard that the role was first offered to Leonardo DiCaprio. Thank God, he turned it down! Christain Bale is just superb in the role.The story revolves around a trader working Wall Street during the mid 1980's. He is your typical ""yuppie"" of the 1980's, totally consumed with himself and style. However, this yuppie is also on the fringes of insanity. How insane he is, you don't know, because he is the narrator. In fact, one of the great things about this film, is that you don't know what is real or what is playing out in the imagination of Patrick Bateman.Many films have tried to capture the essence of the 1980's, few have done it. This movie achieves that and then some. It show what a truly pretensious, greedy and hollow decade it was. It was the decade of Reagan. People are so wrapped up in themselves, that they fail to see the danger that surrounds them and in fact might kill them. Great filmmaking, **** out of ****.",American Psycho
248,patryk-czekaj,Devil inside,8,27 April 2012,"In order to start the review I shall mention that this is truly one of my favorite movies. A personal top 10 list perhaps. I watched it several times and every time I found another moment or scene that made me fall in love once more. That is why I wasn't really able to find any flaws in American Psycho, the gripping tale of a Wall Street yuppie, who turns into a ruthless murderer at night. But that you probably already know. What you may not know is that the amount of blood and gore is on a totally different level that in the book. So if you think that this movie is controversial I advise you to read Bret Easton Ellis' masterpiece. Believe me, you won't regret it. The deep insight into the character's mind and much more brutal descriptions of all sorts of tortures make the movie only a enjoyable complement.This is really the best delusional satire on the Wall Street boom of the 1980's and the presence of a distinct yuppie culture. Every one of the high-positioned businessmen cares only about his looks, bank account and the most expensive food and clothes. Oh, and definitely has no soul whatsoever. No emotional needs. Just look at Bateman. He kills innocent people in order to satisfy his strangest desires and achieve fulfillment. Yet with every killing his cravings become stronger and stronger. He is detached from this world, a true sociopath. But how many of you didn't even once think about killing someone, simply because he did something frustrating? Maybe Patrick is the only one, who is able to present (in a most radical way) his dissatisfaction with humanity and our horrible world. On a totally unrelated topic - how awesome is Christian Bale's as Patrick Bateman? He fits perfectly, with his handsome face, elegance, style, manner of speaking. It's like he was born for that role (and probably for one more - Bat(e)man - notice that this isn't a coincidence). I would also like to mention that the fact that glitz and glamor of Oscar-related greatness passed by American Psycho is a good thing. The movie went on to become one of the most thrilling indie horrors of all time and Bale, being an icon to many, was able to go on working on other great projects without the omnipresent burden of awards.Finally, I would strongly recommend that you watch American Psycho only after reading the book. Then you will be able to appreciate the pure genius of the movie's atmosphere and Bale's acting. It will put a new perspective on your perception of his character. Because, after all, American Psycho is a deeply psychological tale that will keep you focused until the very last minute.",American Psycho
249,Horrorible_Horror_Films,I liked it until the chainsaw,4,1 March 2007,"I have not read the novel yet, but knowing the novel by reputation I was interested in seeing the film. It was interesting, nailed the 1980s rich, wall street thing really well. But this movie really went downhill when he ran after the hooker he hired with a chainsaw. How the hell would no one in his apartment building hear him?? And how the hell can he expertly project the chainsaw to fly down a few flights of stairs after the girl?? No one hears any of this noise, or suspects him of anything? Nothing is explained. Its at this point this film jumps the shark, and his inner narrations start to get to me in how annoying as hell he sounds. Apparently from the chainsaw seen onward it deviates strongly from the book - I watched this with someone how has read the novel a couple of times. So its, a good film for the first part then gets really stupid, and ends up sucking. 4/10 is generous.",American Psycho
250,Semisonic,A Clockwork Orange of the noughties,8,31 July 2015,"It's the 80's outside, and it looks like Patrick Bateman is living a true American dream: a job of an investment banker, a pitch-perfect physical shape, a pack of high-status jock friends and a hot fiancée. But is he really? Because behind this mask of success there are real demons, skeletons in the closet and heads in the freezer.To some adepts of Stanley Kubrick, even comparing their beloved masterpiece to anything else would be a sacrilege. But those films are indeed strangely similar. Even though the former bathes in a cosmopolitan decadence and preaches about a conflict between a citizen and a state, while the latter is more about an American mission of the world's guardian and a conflict between a person and a society. But both of these films choose a very peculiar means of delivering their messages - a sheer and unobscured violence, gore and sexual narcissism.To be honest, A Clockwork Orange didn't work for me. Partly because it lost most of its shocking charge over the decades, and the scenes that must've been extra provocative in the 70's are now nothing too special. But it's not just that. The main character of the movie was always just a part of a bigger system, something he might have loathed but at the same time would've been helpless and even pointless without, like a fish without water. Which makes the overall drama less intense and more like a sketch from a regular ""homo homini lupus est"" life.In American Psycho however, the drama resides within a single man, in his life and (or maybe it would be better to say ""or"") in his head. Patrick Bateman tries his hardest pretending to be a normal fish, but he's already suffocating in the poisonous pond of his life, and nothing, even the drastic measures, can help him truly embrace it and feel fulfilled.Maybe this concept works better because, unlike a bizarre and rather dystopian world of A Clockwork Orange nobody could imagine living in, American Psycho shows us a very believable image of an American upper class citizen's life. So believable that Patrick Bateman could easily be neighbors with Bud Fox from Wall Street. Which only makes it even more shocking to see how different are the things those seemingly similar people do behind the closed doors of their vast apartments.One could not talk about this film and not mention Christian Bale's performance. We all know him as a versatile actor capable of doing extraordinary things to make a bang out of his roles, and if you doubt that then simply look up that pic with a chart of weight changes he made himself go through in order to fit into his roles. Yet this time it's not just the weight. It's that unabated self-adoration and self-loathing. Separately those things had been done a million times, and i could probably recall Philip Seymour Hoffman being natural doing each of them for various roles, but i have yet to see a better display of a character showing them both at the same time. Still, such brilliance has its drawbacks. Because, even cast along with such heavyweights as Willem Dafoe and Reese Witherspoon, Bale simply outshines everyone else, effectively making this film mostly a single actor's performance. What is worse though is that the rest of the cast don't even seem to care to make their presence on screen memorable or at least noticeable.Despite being set in the time of Reagan's presidency, American Psycho is obviously a child of late 90's and early noughties. I'm trying hard to remember when the movies started showing this mental shift from glorifying success and making it an apex of human desires and dreams to despising this glorification and rejecting the vanity it brings and symbolizes. Maybe it was Fight Club that pioneered this niche, in which case its cult status gets another reason to exist. But while Fight Club uses mental illness as a main ingredient for an action thriller where the protagonist does break the system he hates so much, here in American Psycho we are ultimately left clueless whether these breakouts of insanity really took place. What if they didn't - and all this was just a sick cry for help from a soul forever trapped in the cage society put it in? Or maybe they did - and the society simply didn't care, busy with its everyday routine. Wouldn't it be even worse?",American Psycho
251,ab-2,"One weird, though-provoking horror/thriller",8,25 July 2001,"American Psycho is a horror/thriller and is one hell of a good film that made me think. The movie focuses around the life of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) who when he is not cutting up and prostitutes, is instead doing his job on wall-street. American Psycho I thought was pretty different than any other horror, thriller, slasher,. etc. movies. This movie is really all of them put together in one good movie. When you watch this movie you think if these murders that Bateman is commiting are real or just his own imagination, his own fantasy. If they are real you wonder how does he just seem to get away with it. This movie has some impressive acting by both Christian Bale and Willem Dafoe. I reconmend this movie if your the kind of person who likes ""thinking"" movies. If your not well maybe you will not like it as much.10/10",American Psycho
252,ab-2,Not really a horror movie,8,10 December 2001,"American Psycho is really not a scary movie. I orignaly had a comment praising this film highly, well I change my mind. People, try to ignore that comment. I thought about this movie for a while and while the movie makes you wonder whether the people he kills are really murders or not, it doesn't scare the viewer. Yes the movie is at times thrilling, but not scary. Movies like The Evil Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre make you scream and hide in under your blanket. This movie didn't make me. I would personally not recommend this movie to horror fanatics because it is not horror really. If you want real horror, watch The Evil Dead and its sequels.8/10",American Psycho
253,arthera09,not quite there,6,8 March 2008,"This movie had great vision and some really good ideas, but it just did not pull it off. This movie is filled with great little moments, but as a whole it did come together. Christian Bale was brilliant and there was nothing wrong with him, but the rest of the movie was not there. The opening scene was awesome, but almost too cliché. They did explore the decent into madness very well. The violence was not over the top which was nice, but I think if they should more of the murders it would have been better in the end. Not that they needed to actually show the blood or gore, but to add show him killing people. The whole police aspect of the movie was not put together well and I did not feel at any point that he was a threat. They could have done without it or they could have expanded on it. As it stood it did not work for me. For me I don't think that there was that much confusion on the ending. I do no think he killed Jared Leto's character, but did end up killing people, but because he was crazy he was not able to keep things straight in his head. The best scene was the opening scene followed by his sex scene where he was flexing. I also loved the dialog of about the music. It felt as if it read right our a review (as it was supposed to) and just added to the fact that he was not human capable of normal human emotion. Overall not a great movie, but Christian Bale saved it from being even lower for me. There were great ideas and maybe in someone else's hands it could have been a masterpiece.",American Psycho
254,jay4stein79-1,Sussudio,10,19 March 2006,"There are at least ten reasons why you should watch this wonderful, macabre movie:10) Justin Theroux is in the movie and he went to Bennington. So did Bret Easton Ellis, who you undoubtedly know wrote the book this movie is based on, but they didn't attend at the same time. That's okay though because I just like that a Bennington alumnus starred in a film based on a book by another alumnus. That and I think Theroux can be talented when working with a decent director, as he does here. 9) They kill Jared Leto's character. Any movie that does that gets at least an additional two stars. It can make a mediocre movie into something I would describe as ""a good way to spend two hours"" (Panic Room, I'm looking at you). 8) The book is pretty much unreadable, to me, and not because of its gore (though there's some rough stuff there); it's just boring and the pages and pages and pages about Huey Lewis really aren't that fascinating to anyone other than BEE. 7) The obligatory defusing of misogyny: It was made by a woman! The Patrick Bateman character kills women (grusomely)! So it's okay! I'm not sure I buy that line of reasoning. Frankly, the violence against women here is appropriate because, duh, we're not supposed to like Patrick Bateman. We're supposed to see him as a product of his deluded times. We're supposed to understand that he's either become unhinged as a result of contemporary impersonality or he's a monster because of that impersonality. 6) Willem Defoe's performance as an inept version of Columbo (who was inept enough as it was) is brilliant. 5) The film is delirious, completely. It moves fast and, in a lot of ways, seems as insane as its anti-protagonist. However, it never feels that it's out of control; you know all the time that the filmmakers know how crazy, absurd, and darkly funny the material and performances are. It's almost like some gruesome, EC comic from the 1950s. That's a compliment. 4) Reese Witherspoon3) Remember how I complained about pages upon pages in the book that expound upon the virtues of Phil Collins and Huey Lewis? Here they work because their shorter and, frankly, they're visual jokes, ultimately. Who knew it was funnier to actually watch a deranged psychopath go after someone with an ax while discussing Sussudio?2) Christian Bale proves yet again that he needs more work. I'm glad he's getting more of it now, but I think those of us that saw this and Velvet Goldmine were wondering why we weren't seeing more of him. 1) It's just a very very good movie that many people will find enjoyable. Unless they dislike bloodshed, in which case they should stay away.",American Psycho
255,skrstenansky,Masterpiece,10,12 October 2021,"A true psychological masterpiece. This movie goes into the daily life of Patrick Bateman, a normal working man despite the fact that he is psycho. It follows him and his fantasies throughout his different interactions through life, it does a good job at showing insanity and is very confusing at times. The casting of Christian Bale is absolutely perfect and could not have been done better. A very well done and unique and amazing masterpiece of a movie.",American Psycho
256,Torgo_Approves,A video tape you'll never want to return!,10,15 January 2007,"Christian Bale proves why he's the best actor of his generation, and one of the greatest in film history, as he dominates every single scene of this blood-splattered, sadistically hilarious, strongly and bluntly satirical, well polished and freakishly enjoyable work of comic art from one-hit-wonder Mary Harron. This is Bale's best performance, and most likely the one he'll be remembered for; I'm positive that long after the mega-hype for Batman Begins has died down, people will still be quoting the charming sociopath Patrick Bateman in their daily conversations.We follow Mr. Bateman (successful, rich stockbroker at day, narcissistic, cold-blooded psychopath at night) through his repetitive, meaningless life - meeting friends at expensive restaurants, cheating on his fiancée, comparing business cards, unsuccessfully trying to get reservations at Dorcia's, watching the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, quoting Ted Bundy for laughs, having a slightly better haircut than Markus Halberstram - as his mask of sanity slips further and further down his chiseled face. No matter how good he looks, no matter how rich and pumped he gets, no matter how many girls he bones, he just cannot find pleasure in his life. There is only one thing left to do to get that adrenaline rush: chop your friends up with axes, chainsaws, and power drills! The movie is very violent, although not in the pornographically gratuitous way that the Saw- or Hostel-type films are violent: we never really see anyone take an axe to the head and the actual acts of violence are left to our imagination. It is also not a movie to show to your grandmother (no matter how much of a sadist she might be) since it features some graphic sex scenes (nothing above soft-core level, though). Neither sex nor violence is the movie's main focus, however: this is a pitch-black comedy which is revoltingly, side-splittingly funny if you ""get"" its type of humour. The comedy stems mostly from the absurdity of the uber-shallow characters and their stuffed egos. Almost every conversation is absolutely hilarious and you'll find yourself quoting the film for the rest of your life. It truly sticks with you.The acting is superb with Bale outdoing everyone even as the supporting cast delivers solid performances left and right. The supporting actors definitely know how to make the dialogue comical and I'd love to see more of Justin Theroux (Timothy Bryce) and Matt Ross (Luis Carruthers). Jared Leto is spectacular as always, providing one of the film's most memorable scenes (and most hilarious quotes) in a small but important supporting role. An underused Willem Dafoe also makes a very eerie guest appearance as the scariest police detective of all time.The direction is also marvelous. Mary Harron successfully melds exhilarating segments of music with high tension, comedy, and scenes which are a little of both. The final result is nothing short of a masterpiece. I still can't find a flaw with it.I haven't read the novel by Bret Easton Ellis (yeah, yeah, I know, I suck...) and cannot compare, but if it's anywhere near as good as this film I really have to seek it out. The film, on its own, is in my opinion one of the best ever made, and one of the most sadly overlooked. Trust me, you'll never listen to Phil Collins or Huey Lewis and the News the same way again. Simply put? American Psycho rocks, period. It's a playful, but mysterious little movie. You'll love it.",American Psycho
257,danielll_rs,"Sick, bitter, sarcastic, weird, brilliant- one of the best and most underrated films of 2000",8,11 March 2001,"AMERICAN PSYCHO (2000) ***1/2 Directed by Mary Harron. Starring: Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny, Cara Seymour, Samantha Mathis, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon.While writing Christian Bale's name above, I almost confused myself and wrote Patrick Bateman, the name of his character in AMERICAN PSYCHO. This is the kind of reaction that Bale, once the boy in the tragic EMPIRE OF THE SUN, causes in the audience- he fits perfectly Patrick Bateman, the Wall Street yuppie who starts killing people at night for no apparent reason. A pity that Mary Harron's film, based on Breat Easton Ellis' polemic and successful book, was so overlooked and underrated. It became known for the wrong reason: a scene of menage-a-trois that had to be cut in order to avoid the NC-17 rating (BTW, the scene wasn't cut here in Brazil!!!!!!) and the extreme violence. Some people called AMERICAN PSYCHO a pointless satire, or a satire about nothing. They aren't totally wrong: it is about the ""sweet nothing"" of the '80s, the age of yuppies, who had much money and not much else.Mary Harron prints a weird style into AMERICAN PSYCHO, a kind of cross between David Lynch, David Fincher and herself- what can be seen in I SHOT ANDY WARHOL, her very interesting film debut. I haven't read Breat Easton Ellis' book, but I guess Mary, as a director and a screenwriter, did a good job, avoiding the extreme violence, but showing it stylized. The characters have a great development and the situations keep our attention from start to finish. It's awesome when Patrick talks about music before killing his next victim, when he and his friends compare his cards and all his observations about that stupid age and how he tried to escape from that, even being part of it. His lines are sarcastic, ironic.Patrick Bateman is not the usual main character of a film, so it would be difficult to play him. But Christian Bale perfectly shows how ambiguous and hard to understand Patrick is. We hate him and love him at the same time. I loved his performance! The supporting actors are also great, even in small roles. Willem Dafoe is detective Donald Kimball, who has some strange dialogues with Patrick. Chloe Sevigny is great as his secretary Jean, maybe the only innocent person in a nest of snakes. Cara Seymour is Christie, a melancholic prostitute who keeps going to his flat- I voted for her on the IMDb poll which asked: ""From the movies of 2000 I felt most sorry for..."". BTW, she is in my favorite scene, the weirdest of the whole film, right after the second menage-a-trois scene (the ""yuppie"" written on the wall, the bodies, so cool!), mixing very black humor and tension. Jared Leto is Paul Allen, the first victim we see being killed. Samantha Mathis is Courtney, Bateman's drug addict lover. And Reese Witherspoon is Evelyn Williams, Bateman's annoying fiancé- I wanted more of her.On its last third, AMERICAN PSYCHO shows the truth beyond it, resulting in an ambiguous, thought-provoking finale, which stays with us for many days. It proves that AMERICAN PSYCHO is a delightful film to watch, but not in a good way. It's a wicked, sick, bitter, sarcastic, weird, brilliant satire, a triumph of black humor, with many memorable moments. It's an admirable, audacious portrait of the yuppie age, taking the love and the hate to that era to the last consequences. Expect surprises like in a sort of magic show. Love it or hate it, you won't leave the movies indifferent. And someday they wanted to put Leonardo DiCaprio as Patrick Bateman...I saw the menage-a-trois scene in the movies, you didn't...!!!",American Psycho
258,dataconflossmoor,Just How Eighties Are You?,10,19 October 2007,"Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman who is a stockbroker, a successful stockbroker, in the eighties!! What does that mean? The sky was the limit!! BMW's and $180.00 bottles of wine were everyday tokens of a very leveraged period of economic expansion!! The titillating taste of raw capitalism made Patrick Bateman morally oblivious to the lethal consequences of his reckless actions!! It was all about chic restaurants that were approved by the New York Times, and, sexual proclivities which satiated Bateman's immediate hedonistic desires!! No, he was not telling a six year old kid who was looking at a plate full of mixed vegetables to ""Don't just stare at it, eat it"" .. You'll have to watch the movie!!Here are the ground rules to the 1980's, be a smashing success in the stock market, and, as a result, be a serial killer!! Makes sense to me!! These self centered obsessions now materialized as a 24/7 preoccupation for Patrick Bateman.. His callous fruition had no tolerance for the mundane, was this illogical? For the real world, yes, for Bateman, of course not!! This film gives the movie audience an enticing invitation to the irrational thought patterns of Patrick Bateman.. I took them up on it, and indulged the entire film with a sort of heinous empathy for Christian Bale's character. I totally understood that he was the American psycho who had an intensely high testosterone level which was motivated by an exhilarating avariciousness!! The rationale being, ""I work out"" ""I make $250,000.00 a year"", I am always seen at the right places, and last, but certainly not least, ""I live in New York""... Do all of these things make me better? YES!!!.. SO NOW!!! My favorite hobby is being a very creative and utterly unmitigated assassin!!!The eighties were great times, the ""greed is good"" philosophy was predominant, everyone was incredibly self centered, (I'm just being honest!!) It became a competitive instance of which people were better at it!!! Sort of like now, only today, it is a concept that is not all that new to us!! The film ""American Psycho"" translates to unscrupulous chicanery being the end result of a nauseating arrogance... All of us are human, we fall prey to personal motives and pecuniary fixations, it is just a matter of which people have the proper credentials to implement these desires the most expeditiously!! The 1980's YUPPIE tenet perennially professed the concept of ""Take the term Wall Street Mogul seriously, or, be bludgeoned to death!!!"" They were kidding, but, only a little!!!The movie ""American Psycho"" is extremely well written, and evokes an exaggerated camaraderie with the prosperity of the eighties!! Christian Bale's acting performance in this movie is one of the best performances I have ever seen!! His perceived superiority was his convoluted form of amelioration!! Think about it this way, people can raise a family on less than $40,000.00 a year, but, they find a cuss word offensive? The same might hold true in the case of Patrick Bateman's covert vindication for his antics of absolute depravity and blatant disregard for human life!! How do these two statements correlate? They are directly related to the proverbial perception of hoof beats meaning zebras and not horses!!! I for one got caught up in the moment, and NO!! I am not seeing a shrink!!! Only because I cannot afford one, I am unemployed!!!""American Psycho"" gets five stars and a perfect ten!!! I love films that make you look in the mirror!! Without question!! Your dark side is alive and well, ultimately, you must make the volatile decision as to what extent this insidious monster prevails!!!

It is a depiction, a fantasy if you will, of the life of modern man and his place in society.Nothing is enough.

By killing your opponents. By eating your sexual partners. By destroying everyone around you.'American Psycho' retains the balance between this psychotic state, a chilling thriller and a very funny movie.The scenes that show Patrick playing music for his guests are absolutely hilarious, as he comments very seriously on records by artists such as Whitney Houston, Phil Collins and Huey Lewis & the News. The funny thing is that he chooses the most commercial or sold out records of these artists, to explain how much better they are compared to their previous, more artistic work. Another message of the state of the receivers of commercial art.You can analyze 'American Psycho' for hours. It can be perceived both as a deep and a fun movie.

Bale plays the renowned Patrick Bateman but is cast in a much different setting - corporate America. While not given any background as to his psychotic break, Bateman appears to us initially through his stream-of-consciousness, in which we get to hear what is going on inside his head. By day Bateman is the son a corporate mogul, but by night he is fueled by his insatiable carnal and murderous cravings. The corporate world in which he lives in is portrayed as being grossly decadent, full of nothing but materialism and foolish pride. But Bale's intense desire to maintain appearances and be the perfect facade or image of what people are looking for, make him all the more dangerous. Underneath the surface, his hold on reality begins to slip away. His introverted nature cares only for his pride as he competes against his coworkers and fulfills his sexual ego in his relations with several whores. When he loses touch with reality and the consequences of his actions, the blood begins to flow.""American Psycho"" is a unique look at how people have different sides to their personality, some of which are scarily schizophrenic.

But to the trained eye, it's a masterpiece that has so much to say and buries it deep beneath the surface, so only the most skillful diggers can find its true meaning.I am in love with American Psycho, because even if most people won't admit it, Patrick Bateman is essentially an extreme version of our weirdest, deepest thoughts and emotions, and Christian Bale delivers an iconic performance that will live on for all eternity.Like I said, buried deep beneath the surface is an extremely clever satire with so much social commentary on the shallow yuppie America and of our weirdest thoughts.American Psycho is an amazing movie.",American Psycho
263,perica-43151,Classic masterpiece,10,27 June 2018,"This movie is a masterpiece, and it is so underrated. So many quotable moments, true perfect cult piece. Violence is measured, much milder than in the book, which is improved on. It shows the true side of Wall Street morality, of all the little Eichmanns that lived and still live in Manhattan. Dark comedy genius, with classic shiny ax scene perfectly in tune with ""Hip to be Square"" music, that Weird Al and Huey Lewis parodied in perfect meta homage. This movie works on so many levels, and although it was hated by the corporate elite and their paid hypocrite critics, time has shown that this movie is going to last. This is Wolf of Wall Street on steroids, wrapped in metaphysical, if murderous, clothing.",American Psycho
264,dhaufrect-1,"""American Psycho"" is a thrilling thriller.",8,6 May 2015,"American Psycho"" is a thrilling film currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. It is directed by Mary Harron. And it is written by Bret Easton Ellis with the screenplay by Mary Harron. Set in the 1980s, the book follows the story of a 27-year-old Harvard graduate named Patrick Bateman, who goes on a killing spree and murders ""twenty, maybe forty people."" It was originally slated for circulation in 1990, but Random House pulled out of distribution, fearing backlash. It was later released as part of a Vintage Series, and quickly sold over 250,000 copies, becoming one of the most popular (and, to some, important) literary works of our time. In the movie, Welsh actor Christian Bale portrays Bateman gleefully tongue-in-cheek, whether it's confessing to manslaughter over the phone (""I just had to kill a lot of people!"") or dancing to Huey Lewis and the News' ""Fore"" album before hitting an associate over the head with an ax. Patrick is a troubled guy. On the surface, he appears to be normal – he's a Wall Street broker with a secretary, an expensive apartment suite, his own limo and a fancy business card. But on the inside, he's a monster – complete with an insatiable blood lust and lack of empathy for fellow human beings. (If he can indeed be classified as one.) As a film and a novel, ""American Psycho"" is an attack on the absurdities of the '80s yuppie era – sometimes the satire isn't very subtle, in fact it's often made very clear, but I liked it. Because the movie is so eccentric and over-the-top, and Bale is so loony and maniacal, the satire needs to be equally strong – and it is. Whether it's business men drooling over each other's fetishistic business cards or Patrick discussing the nuances of modern pop music before killing more victims, ""American Psycho"" hits strong and hard – this is a great, overwhelming cinematic and visual experience. It cannot be condemned for being unsubtle – it never was. The performances are wonderful. Bale is superb as Bateman, totally embodying the character. As a man bewildered by his environment, and wanting only desperately to fit in, Bateman listens to Genesis and ""Hip to Be Square""; finally we have proof that too much Phil Collins and Huey Lewis will turn you into the next Ed Gein. Perhaps some fans of the novel will dislike Bale's performance (at times, it almost seems comical, such as when he murders his coworker Paul Allen, played by Jared Leto). But I thought it was the perfect mix of introspection, self-hatred, outer-loathing, lust, conformity and schizophrenia. Bale manages to capture all of this perfectly, and by the end of the film, I could not imagine anyone else in the role. Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon all have co- starring roles, but at the end of the day it is Bale who really drives this film home – he's the reason it's worth seeing, and in part the reason it exceeds beyond the typical restraints of its genre.",American Psycho
265,Starbuck-13,Unnecessary brutality,4,30 October 2000,"I'm still a little bit unsure about what exactly this movie wants to express.Does it simply want to shock us with the evil which ""lurks inside the hearts of men"" (to quote ""The Shadow"")?Does it want to show the inner demons of a mentally departed, totally insane man?Does it want to portray the incredible fact that in a faceless society, murder goes unpunished?To be true, the last suggestion seems a little bit hard to swallow. Neither do I believe that even superficial Yuppies are so unable to tell apart the faces of their colleagues (having myself an extremely well memory of faces, this strikes me as even more impossible), nor do I believe that such a murder spree would not be noticed by anybody. Of course, the story does not want to portray the whole murder spree realistically - it wants to speak to us in metaphorical ways and you know what? It fails.The movie left me confused in the end and disgusted in the middle. I believe that there is enough brutality in this world, it does not need films like this or ""Natural born killers"" or any others which portray serial killers.Though the movie was sometimes good, especially in the first 30 minutes showing life and decadence of Bateman, it turned into a piece of gore the longer it took.The actors did great jobs - especially Christian Bale, whose face became a mask of insanity - but still, it failed to deliver a decent message.",American Psycho
266,toqtaqiya2,A dark and violent satire of America in the 1980s.,7,10 August 2010,"American Psycho the novel remains a controversial piece of literature. Though now it's considered to be a modern classic. American Psycho the film turns out to be much less controversial. That's because just about all the coarse language, sex and torture scenes weren't included. Instead director Mary Harron smartly focused on the novel's black comedy and character study. Christian Bale is fantastic in the lead role. Just watch his confession on the phone at the end of the film for proof. The looks he gives, the way he talks and moves, and his appearance are very good. In my opinion he's not quite the ideal Patrick Bateman but he comes very close. The murder chapters in the novel gave it an edge, made it more memorable. The exclusion of most of these murders from the film made the cinematic endeavour tamed in comparison. Let's face it, what's shown in the film isn't anything new for cinema. There are films that are much more disturbing and bloody than American Psycho. In any case the murders would have been hard and costly to film if they were included. With the film's minor budget and the controversy surrounding the novel these scenes weren't attempted. What surprised me most, however, was that fitting actors were cast in the supporting roles. They looked and acted the way they were supposed to. Reese Witherspoon played the role of Evelyn Williams. Very nice. Harron's direction turns out to be good as well. Most novel to film adaptations are junk, but here the results are quite good. Thankfully, Bateman's 1980s music reviews (Genesis, Whitney Houston, Huey Lewis & The News) were incorporated into a few scenes. Not in their entirety obviously but some of the best parts are there. The film's comedy is very fine. The story's horror elements are what's best though. Bateman has many characteristics of 1980s society and modern society in general. That's what makes him so important; he just represents the extremes of what people think and how they act nowadays. Even if they don't like to admit it many people resemble Bateman in some way. The soundtrack is, for the most part, upbeat. Cinematographer Andrzej Sekula captured the New York scenery that was necessary. It's not an ideal-looking film set in the 1980s but it's not bad. American Psycho the film is not a bad companion piece to the novel. It's an intellectual horror film; one of the best horror films of the last decade in fact. I recommend it.",American Psycho

Christian Bale is superb in this movie, and there's not words enough to can explain to anyone at the IMDb boards how great he actually is here. The movie delivers full on madness killing sprees, and the closer to the ending credits roll you come the more psychotic both Bale's character 'Patrick Bateman' and the movie as whole will get.

269,joshi_3592,"""No Introduction Necessary""",10,8 January 2010,"Well I'll do it anyway: Patrick Bateman is an average businessman. He has his suck-up friends, his so-called fiancé, and an expensive apartment. He is in good shape, he's healthy except for the use of cocaine, and is on a diet. He hates it when somebody has an more expensive or more exclusive version of whatever it is that he has. He loves Phil Collins music. He brings prostitutes to his home. He kills homeless people. He kills the people he hates. He performs violent experiments with women. He IS the American Psycho.This movie went way beyond my expectations. This not a slasher film, although it has the same characteristics. It's about a man living in a shallow life. A life where a man is only worth the sum of his possessions. A life where the exterior and the suit is more important than your personality. And Patrick Bateman handles it in an unusual way. If you have seen the trailer you've seen him with knifes and chainsaws, etc. but this is not all that is to this movie. yes, it is violent and not for the faint of hearth, but it was a lot less gory than I thought. Then again this is a psychological thriller and in many ways that can be almost as scary.Patrick Bateman: ""I have all the characteristics of a human being: blood, flesh, skin, hair; but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside of me and I don't know why. My nightly bloodlust has overflown into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip"". If you're a person who understands complicated films, and you've just read this quote, don't tell me you're not intrigued. Believe me this movie will blow your mind. And just wait 'till the ending, it's amazing.This movie is a 10/10 in my book. If you can handle it, watch it, this is a must see film. And a severely underrated film.",American Psycho
270,Morejambo54,Comedy?!,6,23 November 2020,"Now, this isn't a bad movie per say. It's just odd. It has its moments, most made by Christian Bale who I loved in this role. The pacing was kind of everywhere especially when it sped up right at the end to reveal the big twist, which I actually did like. The ending was definitely the strongest point of the movie, the start was a bit dull but it was necessary for the plot, it just could have been done in a different way. 6/10 because of the ending and how Christian Bale is perfect for this deluded character, I also found that his performance was funny at a lot of moments, that might just be me though.",American Psycho
271,haydenluz,American Psycho,10,11 April 2020,"Mary Harron's depiction of Bret Easton Ellis novel, American Psycho, is a true, original MASTERPIECE! The most beautiful part about this movie, was the ambiguous approach Mary Harron took. Her direction and story telling had a dark comedic tone, with so many open ended outcomes, having great detailed narration from Christian Bale. She also utilized a lot of foreshadowing, allowing things to really brew up into a fantastic story. Mary Harron used a lot of focused, close up shots, to really display the raw emotions in each character.Christian Bale is an actor, man. I personally connected with a side of his character, because of my OCD nature, quick, sly remarks, and my blunt tone (just not to his extreme). His character is a real narcissist jerk, that is super high octane. Christian Bale did a phenomenal job getting into this role, working out, and really filling the role as an inside psychopath. He paid close attention to detail, really displaying, and explaining the true characteristics of a psychopath. The fact that Bale didn't get nominated for his performance, is a little absurd, considering this is one of his BEST performances. This was mainly a character study of Patrick Bateman, but we also had a lot of great performances across the board, for the supporting cast in Willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas, Samantha Mathis and more.The screenplay by Mary Harron & Guinevere Turner was terrific! They really focused on making this a dark comedy movie, along with the drama/thriller/horror aspect. All of the dialogues had so much intelligent word play, having countless uncensored vulgar conversations, with many righteous remarks. Though there are some scenes that are genuinely horrific, Harron & Turner didn't shy away from incorporating consistent dark humor laughs, that came from the soul.The action was brilliantly utilized, not overdoing it, being very graphic and unsettling. The way Mary Harron ties all the action in, in the final act, left my jaw on the floor, and made me rethink everything!",American Psycho
272,basilisksamuk,Big budget equivalent of Blair Witch Project,2,3 March 2013,"I never liked Brett Easton Ellis' book and I didn't intend to go and see the film. This may seem odd for a lizard with an interest in serial murderers but I am very choosy about the killers I choose to study and the way they are presented, whether they are fictional or not. For instance I have totally lost interest in Thomas Harris and Hannibal Lector. Harris was a wonderful author and Manhunter was a wonderful film. Harris continued to be a brilliant author with ""Silence of the Lambs"" but this was ruined forever, as far as I am concerned, by Anthony Hopkins hammy interpretation. I suppose Jonathan Demme has to take a lot of the blame even though I admire some of his other films. But Lambs killed Lector for me and I can't be arsed to read ""Hannibal"" even though I bought it almost on the day of publication. I think only Michael Mann directing and Brian Cox as Lector could restore my faith in this franchise.The selective clips of American Psycho shown on TV and the interest of my family and friends in serial killers persuaded me to go to the multiplex. You should know right away that the film is very true to the book i.e. it is nihilistic, narcissistic and several other things beginning with n. All right-minded people and reptilians will hate it. I can confirm this because I saw it with Warrior Mouse, Princess Lizardess and a famous musician and film-score composer (no, really) who shall remain nameless. (But lets just call him Monarch of the Glen for now shall we?) To a man, woman, mouse and lizard we all thought it to be utterly tedious, boring and a complete waste of celluloid. In summary there is one joke, repeated several times, which is mildly amusing and at the expense of Phil Collins and other godawful 80s singers, an admittedly excellent performance by Christian Bale, given the pointlessness of the whole exercise, and long minutes of tedium.It was nagging away at me for some time what this film reminded me of. Then it came to me. It was obvious. American Psycho is the big budget version of The Blair Witch Project. Think about it. Both films are full of characters that are so hateful you wish they would get chopped to pieces by the psycho killer after spending five minutes with them. After 90 minutes in their presence you are prepared to wield the chainsaw yourself in order to end the torture of watching them. Both films have been hyped by their publicists and failed literary critics (i.e. film critics) as being masterpieces even though my cats have a better understanding of what makes a good film. Both films last for around 95 minutes and both films feel as though they last for 95 hours whilst you live through them. Both films feature characters who are afraid of things that normal citizens don't give a second thought to; in the case of Blair Witch, a fear of twigs, in the case of American Psycho, a fear of naff business cards or failure to get bookings at snotty restaurants that only women who want to become stick insects so they can star in more crap Hollywood products would want to eat in anyway. None of the characters in either film can tell the difference between fantasy and reality; no audience member of either film cares.",American Psycho

""American Psycho"" though took to a level that it shouldn't have been taken too.  (spoiler here) The scene with the homeless man and the two prostitutes was not needed.  After the prostitute scene, I had to shut it off.  Besides the violence, the shallowness and vileness of Bale's Patrick Bateman made my skin crawl.  He is a nut job of the highest order and he needed to be taken out.  The only decent scene in this very horrible glimpse into the mind of a yuppie whose gone over the cuckoo's nest was nothing at all.  The dialogue in the film was sharp and the performances of Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, and Jared Leto were all right but that was it.  The other characters were annoying, shallow, and inept and the setting was too much in the 1980's (very off-putting).  Overall, ""American Psycho"" is a film that no one should see under any circumstances.  I give it 1 out of 10.",American Psycho

277,kclipper,A statement on narcissism and high society with Bale in top form,8,3 May 2015,"Christian Bale is top notch in this dark comedy that compares serial killer-like sociopathic traits to the drives and ambitions of the opportunists of the New York stock exchange. The setting is the trendy night clubs and big city environment of the 1980's, and Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an executive investment banker who just so happens to have a psychopathic personality that lacks emotion and lusts after torture, murder, greed and social status. His mask of sanity is so well portrayed that eventually when his alter ego gets the best of him, his colleagues and associates do not believe that he is able to commit the crimes he is confessing to.This is a well thought out production by Director, Mary Harron who's screenplay is based on a Bret Easton Ellis novel. Bale plays the ego-maniacal Patrick to sheer perfection. His character, although extremely narcissistic and murderous in nature, displays a guilty conscious that inevitably results in a complete breakdown. The content of the film is dementedly hilarious, as Bateman amorally murders the homeless, mutilates prostitutes, and kills his fellow colleagues over things as simple as business cards and professional status. Bale is excellent at playing a fictional but very complex character, and the film captures the predatory aspects of the big city executive hierarchy. Director, Harron seems to present a statement on the hjman ego and how destructive and desensitized it can be. Comedic touches include Bale chasing a prostitute with a chainsaw through the stairwell of an apartment building completely naked and screaming, and staring himself in a mirror while having sex with prostitutes revealing his complete obsession with his own self image. Its a psychological thriller combined with a twisted sense of humor and appreciation of the musical culture of the 1980's. It features music by Huey Lewis and the News, Genesis, and Robert Palmer, and it all centers on Bateman's ability to irrationally justify his destructive tendencies and descend into a world of madness and depravity. Willem Defoe is a detective hot on his trail and Reese Witherspoon is his self-absorbed, unknowing girlfriend. Audiences will laugh and bewilder over this structurally complicated, satirical character study. Its a story about climbing the ladder of success while disintegrating morally and leaving behind a spiritless, empty shell, but it never ceases to be entertaining.",American Psycho
278,TheEtherWalk,"This is American Psycho. Great great movie, a personal favorite.",10,7 January 2010,"American Psycho is the story of a 20-something 1980s Wall Street exec named Patrick Bateman. He has all the money he could ever want, a beautiful fiancée, a huge apartment, and more. His lifestyle consists of getting reservations at the best restaurants, doing cocaine, working out, cheating on his fiancée with her best friend as well as several prostitutes, renting porno tapes and killing people. (He also never seems to do an ounce of work at whatever it is he does.) He doesn't understand why he does the things he does, but below the surface are clues that make it a brilliant character study, as well as a darkly hilarious satire of yuppie culture. It is also technically brilliant, with great cinematography, set designs and musical score. Watch the chainsaw scene for a good example of all of these.Christian Bale IS Patrick Bateman. I can imagine no other actor in this role. Bateman is narcissistic perfectionist, obsessed with fashion, status and outdoing his co-workers down to the most minute details. There is a scene where he asks two women if they have ever heard of his company, and when they say no, a subtle little scowl forms on his face. This says volumes about his character, how he thinks himself as almost a god and anyone who makes him feel even remotely inadequate needs to be destroyed. Another great scene is where Patrick views a colleague's business card, which is better than his, and he appears to be sweating from every pore. If he can't be the best at everything, he starts to lose it. He is also unable to connect with people on an emotional level, and probably likes it that way. Willem Dafoe shows up as a detective investigating one of his murders, and when he pulls out a CD from Huey Lewis and the News, (one of Bateman's favorites, but more on that later) Bateman denies being a fan of them. He doesn't like making any kind of connection with other people. In fact, Bateman has lived this way for so long that he has forgotten how to feel. (It's also strongly hinted that he might be a latent homosexual who is in complete denial to himself, at least in my opinion.) When his mistress says 'Can we talk?' he replies 'You look beautiful. There's nothing else to say.' He looks on the rest of humanity with contempt, and kills simply because he can. He has nothing in common with them, so he wants to inflict his inner pain on them. This pain is created by his empty life that is void of any meaning. He's like a king looking down on a rabble of peasants. This story could be about anyone in a position of untouchable power. The depth of his character is remarkable, and there's loads of subtext in almost every scene that make you notice something different every time you see this film. And it is very re-watchable. The one person that sheds a light on what little humanity he has left is his secretary Jean, played by the beautiful Chloe Sevigny. He very nearly makes an emotional connection with her, and actually holds back on killing her. I think it's her innocence that saves her, because it makes her the one person who represents hope for Patrick.Few films are able to be both shocking and funny simultaneously, but there are several moments here of ingenious black comedy. The most memorable scene involves Jared Leto's character Paul Allen. Bateman gets him drunk and takes him back to his apartment, and in the living room there are newspapers all over the floor. Bateman starts talking about Huey Lewis and the News, all while putting on a raincoat and grabbing an axe behind Paul's back. While dancing to the song Hip To Be Square, he lunges at Paul with the axe, killing him and spraying blood all over himself and the previously placed newspapers. Absolutely brilliant.This movie is endlessly quotable, from top to bottom. The dry way the characters talk is both hilarious and pathetic. These are not sympathetic characters, but it is enjoyable to watch how they attempt to act like human beings. Who could forget lines like ""It's totally disease-free"" or ""I'm in touch with humanity"". The brutal murders are almost an afterthought to the brilliantly crafted world of Patrick's psyche.If there is a complaint to be made about this movie, it's that it could easily be 10 minutes longer. Some brilliant sections of the book have been omitted, including some surreal and hallucinatory scenes and some hilarious lines that would have brought this to the level of a masterpiece. Maybe Harron plays it a little too safe and should have let the story run wild and unhinged. Having said this, every scene taken from the book is adapted faithfully and the things that have been added make the story better.In 2000, who could have seen a movie like this coming? This could easily have been overlooked entirely, but as it stands today American Psycho is a cult classic. It is endlessly rewatchable, from the multiple psychological layers, to the hilarious dialogue, to the performance of a lifetime by Bale. There has never been a movie like this and there probably never will be.This review has meant nothing... this movie is not an exit.",American Psycho

Christian Bale is perfect as the psychotic Patrick Bateman and the film is filled to the brim with black humor, especially with some of the Patrick's inner monologues. The business card scene was just great! I skipped through the two commentaries and both seemed to be decent but I didn't really care for the featurettes much. They supplied some good information but something, maybe the presentation, maybe the people, just didn't work for me. Oh well, it was still a cool horror flick.",American Psycho
280,liderc,ridiculous slasher movie for some wanna-be-intellectuals,1,9 December 2001,"*Contains Spoilers*While watching this movie I had the feeling that someone wanted to make a basically ordinary slasher movie, but ended up doing an ordinary slasher movie trying to masquerade as some kind of intelligent movie, so people watching the movie can say what an intelligent movie they have watched lately. But the movie is not intelligent. I know this movie is based on a book, but since I haven't read it I can only talk about the movie itself. First of all, the dimwittedness of the movie is betrayed by the character called ""Luis"". The idea may be ok that he admits to be in love with the other man and always kept it a secret up to now, since this shows that the emotions the people show are fake. But this all is spoiled by adding the usual brainless cliches attached to same-gender attracted men to the character: his effeminate behavior etc. From the first moment you see him, you know that if the movie is as bad as you think it is, he will be revealed to be same-gender  attracted. And the scene where he reveals his love is so ridiculous! Sure, if somebody puts his hands around my neck indoors in black leather gloves, the first thing that comes to my mind is that he loves me! There where one or two more scenes that betrayed the usual odd uneasiness of this kind of movies with same-gender attraction. The final scenes in the flat, and the killing of Christie are just the usual slasher-movie scenes. But, the idea that when he throws the chainsaw at her from the top of the stairs while she is at the lowest level and *actually* hits her while running is so dumb I couldn't help laughing! I mean, if this was just an ordinary slasher flick it would be ok, maybe even big fun, but *this* movie wants to pretend to be intellectual? Please! In his final speech Paul simply says nothing, but in a very complex way.Oh yes, and his name: Bateman. Hmm, does this ring a bell? Norman Bates? Boy, how original. But I liked the characters of Christie and Jean, and the actresses portraying them. I also liked the actress that had the line ""Don't come back"" at the end of the movie. But what I really didn't like was that a song by the Mediaeval Baebes is wasted in a trashy movie like this! Sure, Bale has a hot body, but that doesn't save the movie. So, don't waste your time.",American Psycho
281,Hawkensian,"A funny, solid adaptation with a perfectly realised interpretation by Christian Bale.",8,9 August 2012,"Christian Bale delivers a superbly realised interpretation of Patrick Bateman; his performance has already become iconic. The nuances of Bateman's voice, which has an air of arrogance and comical sincerity, are identified by Bale and expertly delivered; Bale's performance is one of my all time favourites. The truly original narrator, endlessly quotable script and brilliantly dark, idiosyncratic humour have created a large following; it's the proverbial cult film.The film follows Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street executive in the prime of his life who is surrounded by equally affluent and aesthetic contemporaries. He is achingly vapid and appears not to have a sincere relationship with anyone, not even his 'supposed fiancé' Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon). In Bateman's world, everything is for surface value, even his job, which he continues with because he 'wants to fit in'. As the strain of his lifestyle begins to overwhelm him, Bateman begins to indulge in his violent urges.The film is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 controversial novel of the same name. As anyone who has read 'American Psycho' will testify, there are passages that are simply unfilmable; the film was always going to be toned down in comparison. However, I feel the film has been neutered somewhat, I feel the film is lacking a visceral edge, it nails the satire, but it isn't quite dark enough. As the novel progresses, Patrick Bateman becomes increasingly psychotic and depraved, he descends into the depths of madness, and this isn't quite captured in the film. As sordid as it sounds, I do believe the film should have been crueller, darker; it should have put more emphasis on the depersonalisation and sadism of Bateman. There is one moment concerning an axe and a raincoat which is thoroughly entertaining and memorable, however it borders almost on slapstick, which it certainly didn't in the novel. The violence rightfully didn't enter exploitation cinema territory, I wouldn't wish for gratuity. But, then again, how do you define gratuitous? At what point does a film or book become gratuitous? These are questions that were at the forefront of my mind when reading the novel, and I think it's very hard to answer.Despite this, it is a good adaptation; Harron and Turner's script is sharp and overall makes good use of its difficult source material. For instance, the film incorporates the book's music chapters to great comic effect; Bateman expressing his admiration and laughably deep analysis of Genesis, Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis and The News to prospective victims. Through these scenes the viewer witnesses the lengths of Bateman's vapidity.It is a rather difficult film to wholly appreciate and absorb on initial viewing, which is good, because I feel 'American Psycho' has much replay value; I have revisited both the book and film countless times. Much like the novel, the film polarised audiences, and it doesn't surprise me. When viewing for the first time, one must appreciate Bret Easton Ellis used a large helping of hyperbole to convey his message of greed and superficiality, and also a good deal of surrealism. The film isn't entirely rooted in reality. The way in which Bateman's associates repeatedly forget each other's names and identities and how Bateman's actions become questionably implausible may confuse or deter the viewer. However, some would say that in our world of revolting socialites and vacuous celebrity and fashion culture, the extent of American Psycho's hyperbole is becoming increasingly dubious in places.'American Psycho' is a peculiar creation. Many people get it and love it, however I'm sure many would be perplexed by it, maybe completely disappointed by it. I am biased, but I know that I am one of many people who fully appreciate 'American Psycho', part of a large group who will know what you mean when you say 'I have to return some videotapes'. Some won't like or appreciate it, and that's no detriment of the viewer's, but if you do, then I think you'll find yourself revisiting the film and picking up a copy of Ellis' compulsively readable novel. However, regardless of whether you like it, I can guarantee that you'll never hear Phil Collins' 'Sussudio' in the same way again.www.hawkensian.com",American Psycho
282,emryse,I'm Just a Happy Camper :),10,20 June 2021,"I watched this film yesterday evening and haven't been able to stop thinking about it since, it gripped me in a way that not many films do and stuck in my mind.The story is very simple, it follows Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale, as a seemingly normal man who murders hookers and homeless people in his spare time, the cinematography is simplistic but it feels like it works perfectly with the story of what everyone assumes is a normal man, the music choices all compliment the movie sublimely, adding to every scene they are in and the cast is all pretty strong, this film though is really carried by one aspect. Christian Bale.He puts in one of my favourite performances of all time as a narcissistic, violent, sociopath, someone you can't help but hate. Bale perfectly captures the duality of Bateman, trying to fit in but struggling to keep up the charade and every time the mask drops you truly believe that he has gone crazy, the physicality and dialogue come together perfectly to give us a simply unforgettable performance. Without Bale I don't think this film would be anywhere near as good and this movie cements him as one of my all time favourite actors.Some people have problems with the ending and I originally felt similar but I think it encapsulates how even though Bateman is the villain, everyone around him is responsible for his actions as well, that's the best way I can put it without getting into spoilers. If you haven't watched this film yet, please do, if only for Christian Bale's amazing performance. 10/10.",American Psycho

All of them with their own message and version of America, and now this underrated classic not only shows a new vision of America but also of his craziest psychopath.... interesting no? ""American Psycho"" tells the beautiful, crazy, insane, fun, violent life of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). An eccentric American businessman working as an executive of a major bank in Wall Street. Patrick in work he seems the normal rich American worker, but Patrick has an extraordinary secret life ranging from a daily routine with certain quirks to keep things arranged in a certain order; food fads; crazes appearance at work; kill someone in cold blood every night since prostitutes coworkers that he just felt jealousy; and .... oh, wait a minute! As you see, the life of Patrick is one of a psychopathic killer who tries to hide appearances at work, but the film goes far beyond the expected. Director- writer Mary Harron to adapt the novel of Bret Easton Ellis at the same time she tries to be faithful, it goes much further exploring the mind of Patrick 's character more and more.The film with a story that it could had follow with a somber and a creepy tone of horror movie, but no. In the first few scenes of the film, Mary Harron presents us with a beautiful humor, that ranges from clever phrases to a humorous narrative, and 70% of comes from the mouth of Patrick makes us laugh, that make us feeling at certain times that we are facing a black comedy. Some may consider the humor stupid or unnecessary, but it serves mainly to make us relate to the character Patrick throughout the film, even in the darkest hours.And yes, the film doesn't escape to have dark and even scary moments, but those moments come through a superb narrative followed with great dialogs with many varied subjects ranging from women-philosophy to the characteristics of the perfect business cards. We even have a moment of dialog between Patrick with two lovers about the songs of Whitney Houston that end's up in the most violent and grim scene of the movie, making us feeling that we are now facing a violent and disturbing film. Such dialogs may be unnecessary for some or boring, but they are so well written and interesting, and serve once again to get into the mad mind of Patrick that at various points where we got to see the kind of person he is and the cause of his great hatred for human being and even the cause of his daily foibles, everything related.In the levels of performance, the entire cast does a good job, but as always Bale delivers an extravagant performance with its unforgettable character and superb acting deserved of at least a nomination.A film that goes from humorous to dark and sometimes mysterious, complete with a great script and good direction with an extravagant performance of Bale, makes us enter in the mind of a psychopath in this unforgettable and must-see classic.9/10",American Psycho

288,Embley,Surprisingly boring,2,13 May 2000,There was so much hype around this film that it was hard to go into it without any preconceptions.  I tried to read the book ages ago but was bored stiff by the descriptions of what Patrick Bateman wore and all his expensive doo-dad's.  When I heard that the movie was going to be done very tongue in cheek I was pretty apprehensive about it - that could go so so wrong.  In actual fact it did not go all that wrong.  It was not funny (at least not to me) especially in the way I thought it would be done and the way it was portrayed in the teasers.  I expected it to be cartoonish and it was not.  But I also expected it to be disturbing to some degree and it was not.  I find the fact that it was not disturbing very disturbing.  This is a story of a sociopathic serial killer - who kills many people and kills them fairly graphically on screen.  And yet it was not all that disturbing..  I guess that says something about me..  I was bored and just wanted the movie to be over.  I guess some of the book really did creep through to the film.,American Psycho

Yes you are deeply flawed but so is every other human being on this godforsaken earth.Patrick Bateman's character is almost too fun but too shallow at times. The way he was disappointed when Bryce favoured other card and how he was finally broken by Luis' business card. The way he let Reese Witherspoon let off because they were together for a long time.The only thing the story doesn't give light enough is on the topic whether Bateman really killed others or not. The doorman, the prostitutes and that old lady outside the ATM machine. But, more than that I want to know whether he really killed that poor dog with the homeless man or was it just another of his ""drawings"".In all, a tightly packed movie with some high points but other than that, it can be a good study but I think Dexter took the concept and made it to so much more. That is also based on book(s) and it was also based on a novel but I don't know how much it is accurate (I have not read the novel) but I am pretty sure the ending must be kind of different in the novel.

292,Det_McNulty,"A Cynical Social-Commentary, and One Which Is Irresistibly Relevant For Today's World",8,25 February 2008,"Christian Bale is arguably modern cinema's most underrated actor. I sometimes consider hailing him as the greatest performer of this generation, particularly whenever I re-watch his leap-to-fame performance in American Psycho. On its release it erroneously received mixed acclaim; nevertheless, Bale was nearly always commended for performing in the remarkably charismatic role of Patrick Bateman. The character ranks among contemporary literature's greatest creations, and back in 2000 a young Bale somehow managed to embody the yuppie maniac. The character's slickly menacing demeanour, attentive idiosyncrasies, and always brewing revulsion is intuitively mastered in this offbeat satire. Patrick Bateman is both the definitive New York yuppie and the ultimate sociopath. He is masked by the Wall Street businessman persona, and his pastime activities are unnoticed by his self-obsessed associates- like himself. He thrives off a colossal maze of jealously, established on distaste for any minor, physical and social hiccup. Little do such men know that they are dehumanising any merit they once had.Bret Easton Ellis' original novel contains possibly the most graphic depictions of sex and violence in any novel I have ever read. Appropriately, director Mary Harron places much of the novel's explicit content off-screen, similar to how the book simply lets the reader imagine the vivid nature of the content. For this reason, American Psycho is faithful to its source, and for a novel which includes such terminal violence there is still a huge amount of wit and charm. This owes to the book's satirical disposition, with its brazen accuracy and jagged humour. It is in many respects an absurdist's take on an already surreal culture; this lends the questionable theme of subjective reality to the protagonist's actions and experiences. Mary Harron utilises the satirical facets of the novel, and essentially uses satire as a device of ridiculing yuppie culture. Nevertheless, the component which is best suited is that this image of an alpha-male dominated society, which is directed from a female standpoint, but not an overtly feminist one. More than anything, American Psycho is a critique of ignorance, materialism and self-infatuation.The cast play it cool throughout the feature, concurrently sinking their teeth into the bitter irony of cultural stereotypes. For those of you who might be put off by the sardonic title; don't be. This is a twisted and intelligent take on cultural archetypes, with much prominence being placed on whether the viewer deems Patrick Bateman's sociopath alter-ego a manifestation of sub-conscious monotony or that he is genuinely committing the murderous, masochistic acts shown on screen. Whichever way you look at it, there is no definitive answer, but one thing is for sure, that this cinematic assertion is a strong sentiment of yuppie narcissism. As dark as it may seem, there is no denying the indisputable entertainment quality of a film crammed with meaningful malevolence. This is a film which unsympathetically attacks the business world, implying that dumb people from wealthy backgrounds are groomed for slacker success. These white collar machines are not savvy, nor do they even so much as turn a blind-eye to anyone other than their materialistic statements of self-worth. In a way, this is their only means of clinging onto reality, for they hide behind their denial, with a reputable image of self-worth.",American Psycho
293,motrous,American Psycho,6,13 May 2021,"Not one of my favorite movies, but I get the appeal I guess. It's a very unusual movie. Not to my taste. But it's a significant entry into the larger film canon and worth watching just to say you've watched it.",American Psycho
294,jangu,Almost perfect despite the ugly storyline,7,24 October 2002,"Oh, it could have been a very very bad movie indeed. The infamous novel is very horrifying and contains the most graphic descriptions of murder and mayhem I have ever read. Oliver Stone, who was to direct, probably would have made a much darker movie with the violence turned up at least a notch or two.As it is, Mary Harron has chosen not to be too graphic but stays tasteful all through the picture, even when the action gets bloody. And there is still plenty of gushing gore and since you don't see everything, the impact of the murders, when they arrive, is even more immediate. However, don't expect a slasher movie.
But at the center of it all is Christan Bale as Patrick Bateman. Shallow, self-aware, greedy, narcissistic and completely nuts! As a portrait of a man who has no soul and only exists when he can experience the `high' of murder or have the most stylish business card in his firm, his performance is truly chilling. He is machine, not human, who delights in others pain and degradation, except for one scene in his apartment with his sweet secretary. When he realizes that a murderous rage may be imminent he tells her to get home because `he might hurt her'. Hmmm, in what sense one may wonder? Just kidding. Anyway, at that point, there is a subtle sense that he MIGHT be salvaged by this girl and that he longs for a life that is real.
Christian Bale was apparently not a first choice for the part but seeing him here I doubt that anyone could be a better choice (certainly not Leonardo DiCaprio). He is excellent. Actually I didn't know he had it in him and thought of him as a child actors who's work as an adult had been, at best, indifferent. Clearly playing the part of Bateman is a challenge and had American Psycho been a turkey, it could most certainly had been one nail in his career coffin. Brave man! The other parts are also well casted and well played, but it is Bale who has the center stage.
Praise must also go to Mary Herron who handles this unpleasant story in a manner as to say: Look, Bateman is a man just like most other men but he just go a little bit further. The script that she and Guinevere Turner has fashioned is an extremely interesting look at male behavior. However, if there is something amiss, it is the lack of someone remotely sympathetic. Chloë Sevigny is the exception but she is too bland to be really interesting. All the others are people you would cross the street to avoid! That way you are never very upset when one of Batemans victims `gets it' because you don't really care. But otherwise excellent!",American Psycho
295,manicman84,suspenseful thriller filled with dark humor,7,11 August 2006,"American Psycho is a suspenseful thriller in which dark humor prevails over probability. The film works thanks to Christian Bale who gives an intriguing, convincing performance being, on a par with that in The Mechanist, the best in his career. His villain is incredibly degenerate due to the sick, aristocratic community in which he lives. His main hobby, apart from murdering of people in various ways, is listening music and talking about it, which leads to many hilarious situations in the film. What was also shrewdly used in the script are seemingly minor obsessions, like owning prettier business cards. The flick tears to shreds wealthy aristocratic environment which is responsible for arising sick atmosphere among people occupying the top positions as well as puts a question about individual's responsibility. Thus, the message is very similar to that in Woody Allen's Match Point. However, in American Psycho black humor is used instead of metaphorical meaning.",American Psycho

297,Manal1987,American Psycho... American Society.,8,26 May 2011,"American Psycho is a movie that digs psychologically in order to hit socially. The story is certainly brilliant and mind-spinning, thanks to Bret Easton's book. American Psycho is about an apathetic successful rich young man, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) who suffers from grave psychological disturbances that make him go into killing frenzies. One of the first lines that Bateman says in the movie goes as follows: ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there."" These words apparently set the stage for the events to follow in the film. This idea of being an abstraction resurfaces at the end, making things clearer. American Psycho does not criticize Bateman as an individual. Being and abstraction, he stands for all the 1980s yuppies; this class of young gentlemen who nearly had everything: fame, money and success, yet were vain, stupid, materialistic and superficial from the inside, and who also lost touch with their society and humanity. Sharing the same characteristics is beautifully represented in the movie more than once as everybody gets mistaken for somebody else. Thus, since the idiosyncrasies disappear, the whole society manifests itself in one facade-like individual: Patrick Bateman. Bateman is extremely self-conscious; he is obsessed with cleanness, health, looks and fancy clothes, which almost applies to everyone else. Bateman starts having this killing fits in which he murders prostitutes, strangers and even his colleagues in cold blood. However, unlike the common analysis, I tend to believe that these murders are real, but since Bateman is not an individual as I mentioned before, they are committed by the whole society. How he gets away with all his murders and insults people without them responding show that he is a recurrent case... a collective human condition with no material existence. Christian Bale has certainly excelled himself with this hauntingly beautiful performance. To be able to capture the anxiety, rage, vanity and insanity of an entire society and represent them in one character is sheer brilliance and exquisite talent.",American Psycho

There is a good cast but they don't get as much attention as Bale. Chloë Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, and Samantha Mathis float in and out of scenes as the women in Patrick's life. Willem Dafoe has a short stint as a private detective who's investigating one of Bateman's murders. There are two reasons this film is great, the 80's nostalgia and Bale.

303,WCS02,The double entendre dialogue is a delight. Effectively advancing the story throughout.,10,23 November 2000,"American PsychoLoved it.  Anyone seeking a traditional horror movie on par with Urban Legends, Scream and movies of that kind will likely be disappointed with this film.  This movie fits into a category best described as psychological horror perfected with a black comedy garnish.  It presents the deterioration of main character Patrick Bateman's (played by Christian Bale) sanity; and his descent from a thread-bare lifeline to the real world.  Summing: It's bloody good.The film is littered with clues about what is really happening on-screen. The viewer has to watch/listen carefully indeed to catch it all.  The story is expertly told by Director Mary Harron, based Bret Easton-Ellis' book. She unveils evidence of what is really going on in measured doses, but I did not fully `get it' until the end.  I will be eagerly awaiting Mary's next production based on this work.It is a film for the '90s, dealing with and cleaning up possible consequences from the unstable mind after the decadent 80s on Wall Street. On its face, it is a brutal tale in what might slide into a Slasher Genre. But (as with American Beauty) LOOK CLOSER!  The critical question: `Have you ever let your mind wander about how you might resolve an adversarial situation if there was no possibility of getting caught?'  Magnify those `mind meanderings' by a factor of 100 to reflect slipping from sanity.  This movie's premise explores that avenue completely.  It is handled in a creative, entertaining way for horror fans.The double entendre dialogue was the most enjoyable part for me.  Normally reserved for comedy, it is used as an effective device in this throughout. Listen carefully to what Patrick Bateman says, and to how it is answered by an opposing character on-screen.  The clues regarding what is actually happening on-screenare everywhere.  But stay alert.  Miss nothing.  Good advice.Christian Bale and Willem Dafoe portray thoroughly believable characters. And Chloe Sevigny - always the consummate actress - executes an extraordinary submissive administrative assistant role as Jean.  (She has been a favorite of mind ever since the movie Kids.)It will never dethrone a mainstream, horror classic like Hitchcock's Psycho, but this film will find its niche with devotees of the psychological horror thriller.  My recommendation is to see this film not once - but (at least) twice.  PS:  Not the world's best `Date Movie,' by the way, unless two horror fans are on the prowl for interesting fare.

The film itself made a valiant stab at capturing the essence of the novel whilst also structuring it as a workable movie for the casual viewer, and was never going to be as jaw-dropping as the book. However, a top class cast and some shrewd writing and directorial decisions delivered a film that was better than I expected it to be, and Bale's mesmerising Bateman made sense of the pointlessness of his actions, creating a monster that needs no back-story  he is simply what he is and does what he does because he wants to. This lack of cohesive motive actually works in his favour and it was nice to see no compromise ending. Good film.",American Psycho
308,Blondie_,Recommendation-somewhat of a spoiler alert!,8,4 August 2001,"I enjoyed this movie for the most part and would recommend it to anyone-as long as they are open-minded and not easily offended by the violence and sexual situations. Christian Bale gave an absolutely amazing performance as Patrick Bateman. It is too bad that the Oscar Academy would probably not even consider him to be nominated because of the strong nature of this movie. He added so much variety and depth to the role. His performance will send chills down your spine!! But this movie's nature pales in comparison to the book version, which is much more violent and explicit. I enjoyed watching the 1980's yuppie-scum culture be satirized and put-down in a very clever, sometimes humorous way.THe only criticism I have is the rampaging scene where Patrick goes berserk in public. Very stupidly staged violence that was also very unrealistic. How could he blow up a police squadron and the officers just by firing a normal-appearing handgun?? I also find it hard to believe that he wouldn't of been found after committing such a violent rampage with such a high body count. Law enforcement in such a large, crime-ridden city would of been combing the area on high alert for him, he wouldn't of been in a restaurant, unfound, the very next day!",American Psycho
309,Mister-Creeper,A Serial Killer Yuppie,8,19 August 2007,"American Psycho is a twisted look into the life of an investment banking executive yuppie who just happens to be a deranged serial killer. This movie is not so much a horror movie as it is a satire.Christian Bale's character as the killer yuppie is a bit hard to explain. This is one of those movies you have to watch to really understand, but at the same time you may not understand it even after watching it the first time. I think it requires a second viewing to really get a feel for it and also to do it justice. The music that he plays during some of the killings is just hilarious -- not the type of music you would be thinking about if you were about to kill someone! The ending of this movie is fantastic! I won't spoil that for you, but I loved it! The only thing bad I can say is that I thought it was too long at 101 minutes. Overall, American Psycho is a decent film that you should watch at least twice to appreciate its bizarre approach.",American Psycho
310,garyvanhorn,A very good film that requires some thought to enjoy.,8,11 January 2011,"Christian Bale is an enormously talented actor and he is on full display as a psychotic wall street businessman. I usually pan slasher/thriller movies, they tend to annoy me with meaningless gore and overused clichés, but not so with American Psycho. The movie really takes the time to get inside the head of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) as he acts out his frustration and jealously over life, work, relationships, pretty much everything in increasingly violent and spectacularly homicidal ways.The entire time you can just feel the madness writhing beneath the surface of Bale's character, and often it slips out in blatantly obvious ways that are overlooked by others or taken as humor, much to their dismay after he hacks them to bits. There is a reoccurring theme of mistaken identity and/or locational confusion. This is important but I don't really want to tell you why, I think it's better if you figure it out for yourself and then wonder. I need to get my own copy of American Psycho so I can see it again at my leisure so that I might pick up on every small detail that might unlock the secrets of the film.",American Psycho
311,tpaladino,"Good Film, Phenomenal Book",8,6 April 2006,"First, I have to say that I really did enjoy the film very much. I also read the book AFTER seeing the film, which I think gives me a unique perspective as opposed to those who read the book, then saw the film as a disappointment.With that having been said, I was amazed with the excruciating detail that the novel's Patrick Bateman went into when describing his life and routine. Bret Easton Ellis is a truly remarkable author, and the novel is really a masterpiece of 1980's satire. I honestly can't say enough good things about it. Every page was amazing to me, and I felt that a portrait of a madman had really been painted for us in a way that nobody has done before.The film lacked a lot of this detail, but it was only noticeable after reading the book. I can see how someone who read the book first, then saw the film could have been disappointed, but seeing the film before the book really made me appreciate both much more than I may have otherwise. For someone who has no experience with either the film or the book, I would recommend the movie first, then followed up with the novel. The movie is very enjoyable and interesting on it's own, and the novel adds a tremendous dimension and back-story to the characters and their motivations.Also, one of the criticisms that I read in a previous review had to do with the locations not being believable due to the limited budget of the production. However, as a lifelong resident of Manhattan, the sets and locations ring very true. Pat Bateman's apartment in the movie is a really accurate representation of what a multi-million dollar Manhattan apartment actually looks like. Money does not go very far in this town, and it actually states in the book that Timothy Price made approximately $190,000/year, so it can be presumed that Bateman earned a similar amount. A hefty sum for the time, but not quite billionaire status. The restaurants and offices are also quite realistic and believable, especially since I have actually been to most of the places that are mentioned in the book.Finally, after the film and novel, I have to say that I actually found Pat Bateman someone who I could really relate to on some level, scary though that may sound. The obsession with material possessions; having everything in your life arranged perfectly; the drive to have the best (clothes, apartment, dinner reservations, women, etc), is something that still permeates the culture here in NYC to such a degree that I found many of his obsessions (compulsions?) and mannerisms extremely familiar. Disconcerting as it is, I can easily see where Brett Ellis' mind was when he fleshed out the Bateman character. From this point of view, it's almost easy to see how such behavior can mutate into insanity without even the blink of an eye. It's certainly made me look at my own life in a different light.",American Psycho
312,Manthorpe,Killing people is cool...,9,20 July 2004,"Now this is a good horror slasher flick. It is much more than that as well. Not only does AP bring some class and wit to this genre, but it also brings an eerily realistic and masterful acting performance from Christian Bale. Absolutely perfect. Thinking that Leo was being considered for this makes me nauseous. There's no way he could've pulled it off anywhere even close to the magnitude that Bale did. On top of his acting, he looks perfect for this role...a normal good-looking guy on the outside, but with something very dark and sick just under the surface. You can see it in his eyes. For this film alone, I eagerly await to see him in more films. Now I will say that I have not read the book, so anything I bring up or comment on is strictly for the film itself, as a film. It's usually a fairly pointless routine to compare books and movies anyway.Set in the snooty materialism days of the 80's in New York, all of the film's characters only care about two things, money and themselves. This is a recurring theme that pops up continuously throughout the film, most importantly attributing to the fact that Bale doesn't seem able to be caught because people are too wrapped up in these two things. In that sense, the film is a mockery of sorts, a satire of the time period and culture. Bateman (Bale) cares about money, but has become bored with the way his life has become, and really simply cares about his outward image and his desires that he cannot completely control. Through witty narration and random speeches Bateman gives, we realize the extent of his obsessions and how they completely run every aspect of his life. The best example of this is given in one of the first scenes where he's talking about how he prepares himself for the day. Great stuff. This film also has quite a bit of comedy contained in it as well, at least if you have the right sense of humor. There are several classically funny parts throughout, mostly attributed to the subtle yet clever narration. Not only that, if you leave out the book when interpreting this film, it leaves itself quite open and is a cause for much debate here on IMDb. It's one that can constantly be debated as long as the book worms can't leave out the fact that it's based on a book. I stand somewhere in the middle but on neither side. After all, films should, in all rights, stand by themselves. Visit the AP message boards after viewing for more of what I speak.Overall, an immensely funny look at materialism and murder, and the perceptions contained in our world and or lack thereof. All but perfect. Not for everyone though (especially children), and it's probably a little misunderstood, hence it's curiously low rating. If you enjoyed Fight Club, you'll probably find some intriguing elements here.Highly recommended.",American Psycho

Yes, there are some erotic scenes but I would not call it erotic, there is violence and blood but I would not call it scary, there are some funny moments but I again would not call it funny. Now you may say ""do we have to categorize it?"" Of course, not. But all those elements are so disconnected from one another that they seem out of place. A good-looking killer without a motive. And I still do not know why I was not scared even a bit by the murder scenes. He likes 80s music specially Phil Collins, Huey Lewis and the news. Unfortunately, all these things fail to come together to make meaningful whole. Was the purpose of the movie to create an irony by trying to make a picture with all these irrelevant traits? And what about the final? What conclusion was I supposed to draw from the last conversation he had with his attorney? Did I miss something? Not a good movie.",American Psycho

Patrick has strong desires to murder women and store their body parts in his apartment and the apartment of Paul a guy he murdered. Patrick isn't interested in anything but working out, properly cleaning himself and acting out his sick desires. The film plays out as a satire of the 1980's it shows the emptiness of the decade through the viewpoint of Patrick Bateman. The film has a number of funny times as well as scary and intense times. The director Mary Harron balances the satire elements and the horror elements in a entertaining way. The gory violence mostly occurs off screen though it does still have some good gory moments. The version I got to see was the original uncut version which has a three way sex scene.

320,adeckofcards,Criminal satire,5,26 June 2020,"When you think about a tape about a psychopath, a violent drama-like story instantly comes to mind. In 'American Psycho' this totally changes, when reporting criminal acts in a satirical way.
The film tells the story of Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street worker who murders people at night. The greatest achievement of the film is the development of the main character. The story, being told from its subjective point of view, acquires an absolutely well-made introspection. Unfortunately it is one of the few good things it achieves. The script is pretty weak, so weak that at its end point it can't support itself and leaves plenty of holes behind. This same script risks everything to develop the protagonist and leaves out all the other characters, with minimal development.
Generally speaking, the film doesn't have much more to offer than a well-developed character and the odd funny sequence, even if it's totally ridiculous and implausible. Although, despite everything, the performance of Christian Bale (even without being the best of his career) manages to enhance a rather weak film.",American Psycho
321,maureen_smith5,"A unique and bonkers masterpiece, with a for the ages acting display by Christian Bale",10,20 April 2019,"A revolutionary classic in the psychological thriller genre, with a career defining performance by Christian Bale(the role that led to his most famous role as Batman, can see why)Its one of those few movies that messes with your mind but doesn't ruin the movie, too many modern movies go over the top with their jumbled up plots, this movie gets its spot on.You truly don't know if Patrick Bateman has carried out the insane murders or not, director Mary Harmon really confuses our mind to not know if Bateman has imagined it all, some of it or did kill all those people.Bale is jaw dropping tbh and its his master-fall display that adds to whether he is a psycho, a great storyteller or is a bit of both. He also a lot of the time is down right hysterical, even in murderous rampage moments, strong sexual scenes or any other part, his Bateman will have you chuckling along frequently. His urge to keep returning videotapes, his incredible knowledge of pop music and no desire to do any work(and his love of a pristine identity card)are other standouts plus I have never seen as funny a dance to a Huey Lewis song as he did here(which led to the movie's most brutal and memorable death scene, Batman kills The Joker so to speak).The rest of the cast including Willem Dafoe, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, Samantha Mathis and Josh Lucas back up Bale brilliantly, with all getting their own time to shine, plus all at times seems to be as oddball like as Bale's Bateman. Also the lovely Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's receptionist Jean seems to be one of the few that Bateman actually likes(he intends to kill her but works out he can't, whether that means he was going to or not remains to be seen, I think he was in love with her), Chloe is very beautiful, kind and sweet as Jean.The movie is very violent and gore soaked in places(and doesn't hold back on animal cruelty, even if its mainly off screen)plus if Bateman was carrying out the crimes then all the other characters must be either very dim or know about what he does and they don't care about it, which is a bit weird even for this movie. Also Reese is great but a bit wasted, her talents should of been put to better use, same goes for Mathis and Leto. Whilst the sexual moments are a bit much at times, even if some are done with dark humour attached to them.This though is one of the very best psychological thrillers of all time IMO with a endless supply of iconic moments, scenes and funny lines plus a real brain thinker after you have watched it, making you think about it a lot after watching it. Led by a Oscar worthy Bale as a monster for the ages(or is he)and a terrific supporting cast, American Psycho is absolutely superb.",American Psycho
322,renofhate,"""Do you like Huey Lewis and The News?""",10,17 September 2016,"""...their early work was a little too... new wave, for my tastes.. but when sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own - commercially and artistically."" American Psycho is one of the most quotable movies ever made. It's a dark comedy / crime / drama from the year 2000, and of course its main star is Christian Bale. Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a wealthy investment bank executive from New York who has a bit of an ego. It appears, that Bateman is a psychopath and a serial killer, who has all these sick, twisted fantasies and own gruesome ways.As the film progresses, you're able to see his mind collapse and turn on him, as he goes from killing in control, to being uncontrollable. It's a pretty dark shift, but a very interesting one -- because the movie is, simply put, fantastic. I would have to say, as early as this, that the movie is one of the very best in cinematic history. It's my personal favorite of all time. It's incredible, and Christian Bale is a magnificent actor. He was absolutely brilliant in his role as Bruce Wayne / Batman, among many others... but this was, by far, the performance of his life. Nobody could have portrayed Patrick Bateman other than Bale himself, so it was a perfect casting choice for sure.The movie is dark, funny, violent, and at times can be confusing, but not in a bad way by any means. I would say that American Psycho is one of those movies that, although very, very good, doesn't quite have the total recognition that it so rightfully and so truly deserves. It's got a big large following of fans, though.It's a must-see film and I can't describe it as meaningfully as I would like to. I believe this is just simply, one of those, ""see for yourself, man!"" movies. It's a once in a lifetime movie, perhaps. It's that damn good! There are so many reasons as to why it's my all time favorite film. It's the perfect film for sure.Also, its ending? Here's where you may go wrong. You may come off thinking, ""So, it was all in his own head? He was just, like, imagining the whole scenario and stuff?"" Nope. Literally all of it happened (maybe excluding the bank statement thing with the cat.) You see, I can say (since it's spoiler-ticked review), that it all happens because: if you watch the movie, you'll see what these people are like. They're corrupted. They're greedy. They're selfish. They only want what's best for them, nothing more, nothing less. They barely know each other's real names, and don't care enough to find out what's true, what's proper. You know how like, Paul Allen thinks Bateman's name is Marcus Halberstram? That's an example. They don't care to find out what's right from wrong, truth from lies. So when the guy at the end of the film says, to Bateman: ""because I had dinner with Paul Allen, in London, (however many) days ago..."" what if the guy had dinner with who he thought, was Paul Allen? That's what I mean. Patrick would then continue to slip through and escape any cracks which would enclose him, and keep him with life in prison, or the death penalty.Truly, American Psycho is a remarkable movie. I must-see with so many fantastic moments.10 / 10 5 / 5",American Psycho

I love the absurdity the world is displayed with and how it still remindes us of the hypocritical western civilization we live in. (especially nowadays with all that social media stuff going on)
To me the reason why this movie doesn't bore me, no matter how often I watch it, is that, just like Patrick Bateman says in the movie, it is an idea it doesn't really exist but it's an projection of something we all can more or less relate to. I really don't know anybody that doesn't think the world around him is going crazy from time to time.
And all though of course the average person doesn't walk around killing people and feeding stray cats to ATMs we nevertheless all built this ""American Psycho"" persona in our head to cope with all that's going on around us and at least somehow gain control over it.

A psychologically troubled man that on the surface is a successful gentleman yet behind the scenes he has alarming temptations that involve blood and torture.I feel you would be underselling the film to call it a slasher, this is much better than a slasher. This is a psychological investigation of the mind of a deeply troubled individual. Sure there are scenes that nod towards slasher movies but there are also glimpses of inventive, artistic film-making that some how puts us onto the same level of this American Psycho. Empathy it produces? Perhaps. But thats not the point, this shuddering film presents temptation from the inside rather than the outside. This is where this film succeeds and gains its reputation as more than a slasher movie.Harron's direction is both stirring and comprehensive. Bale proves himself to be a very worthy actor with his adaptation of Ellis' disturbed character. Obsession is all his character is about.

326,MadReviewer,"Delivers Some Shocks, But Ultimately Just Hollow And Boring",5,11 May 2001,"Much like its contemporary ""Fight Club"", the film ""American Psycho"" attempts to express dissatisfaction with the status quo of modern society through shocking (and typically violent) means. However, while this intent can be applauded -- sometimes, it's good to shake things up a little -- the execution cannot. ""American Psycho"", for the most part, features unlikable, unsympathetic characters doing unlikable, unsympathetic things to one another, ultimately creating a film that's very difficult to care about . .. or to take seriously. Based on the overrated novel by Bret Easton Ellis, ""American Psycho"" is the story of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a young, handsome Wall Street stock broker who's finding it more and more difficult to deal with how utterly hypocritical and fake his life has become. He hates the world so much, he doesn't feel like a real person, so the only way he knows how to feel real is by committing acts of sadistic depravity -- rape, torture, and murder. The ironic thing is, Bateman doesn't try to cover his tracks particularly well -- he almost wants to get caught -- but no one else believes he's capable of such heinous acts; after all, how could such a young, good-looking successful man be such a monster? The problem with ""American Psycho"" lies with the psycho himself -- Bateman. Christian Bale does an admirable job with the character, considering how badly the part is written, but the fact of the matter is that Bateman is never a particularly sympathetic protagonist. Yes, the people he tortures and kills are a bunch of unpleasant, two-faced hypocrites, but considering that Bateman is really no better than they are, there's no way of understanding, let alone condoning, his actions. He also has options besides becoming a serial killer, obvious (and more positive) options.  Think about it -- Bateman's been given more opportunities (money, friends, intelligence) than most people can ever even dream of in his life, and he chooses just to squander them as an Ed Gein-wannabe?  Come on.  Another problem is that Bateman is far too sane. He's nuts enough to think up some incredibly sick stuff to do to people, but he's rational enough to realize what he's doing is wrong. It may not have made him more sympathetic, but it might have made the character slightly more believable if he'd been crazier, thinking that his sick actions were just as rational as the mundane, boring things he did at work. (A subplot involving the idea that Bates isn't actually killing anybody -- all the murders are just in his head -- helps to make the film a little more believable, but not by much.) The result? One mean-spirited person kills a bunch of other mean-spirited people. Who cares?
Visually, the film's fine. Director Mary Harron moves the film along at a smooth pace, flipping with great style between false notes of security and genuinely disturbing. However, since the disturbing elements are diluted by the fact that it's difficult to care at all about the characters involved in ""American Psycho"", some tremendous efforts in regards to cinematography and editing get wasted. Ditto the performance of the actors -- as mentioned above, Christian Bale is very good as Bates, Willem Dafoe is good as the criminally under-used private investigator Donald Kimball . . . but no actor or actress on the face of the Earth could ever make any these characters remotely interesting, likable, or for that matter, watchable.
""American Psycho"" deserves some credit for trying to be daring, but it's ultimately an emotionally hollow film filled with some oddly gratuitous, clinically detached violence. Pass this one up. Grade: C-",American Psycho
327,myboigie,The American 1980s in All Its Soulless-Glory,10,12 February 2006,"This is a personal-favorite, though I wonder how-much of it is really horror. It certainly has elements-of-horror, but I see it as more of a personal-allegory, and a social-one that would do Herman Melville proud. OK, it is horror! Social-horror: these are the people in-charge of our world! For those familiar-with the novel, this is a more toned-down affair by Mrs. Harron, a superb-director, who sticks-to the social-themes and implications of the story. There are some scenes of gore, but they are significantly toned-down and minimized, and I think the move was a wise-one. Sometimes, gore detracts too-much from the narrative and the themes of a film, but not here. Reagan America seems pretty innocent to us nowadays, but it was rife with greed and cronyism, and even some of the disastrous military-adventurism we are seeing today (Grenada, 1983, the first-time the press was barred-from an invasion). Sadly, the militarist-culture of Reagan has continued. The seeds of present-day scandals and corruption were being planted during the 1980s.The poor were neglected (and still are), and the mentally-ill were ""deinstitutionalized"", while military-spending blossomed, and there were financial-scandals-galore--then finally, Iran-Contra and a stock market crash. In the cities, a bull-market of speculation had exploded, and there was a materialist obsession with ""luxury-items"", high-priced art, and ridiculous cuisine and fashion-trends that would make a Flapper blush-with-shame. 1980s-fashion is best summed-up as: big-shoulders, no-compassion. Clothing was absolutely ugly, trashy and vulgar, which reflected the times, a Hobbesian-hell of winner-take-all. This, then, is the world of the character Patrick Bateman. People didn't want to know, hear, or talk-about social-problems in the 1980s, which has taken a 180-degree-turn nowadays, a crucial-difference. This--at-least--has changed. The laws of physics provided the soil.What Harron argues, finally, is that Patrick Bateman is unremarkable as a serial-killer within-the-context of the immorality he is surrounded-by. His exact-job is murky, and the firm he works-for is only referred to as ""Pierce & Pierce"" in the film. It also appears he is the benefactor of nepotism from his father, and appears to be creating nothing. What should be noted is that the director's husband produced corporate videos for ""Merrill-Lynch, Pierce & Pierce"" (which she states on both DVDs), so there is more-familiarity between Ellis's book than we would expect. Indeed, I am friendly-with people who work-at ""Merrill-Lynch..."", who confirm that the corporate-culture depicted in the film is accurate--so accurate, when the film came-out, their colleagues opined that they ""could relate to Patrick Bateman"". Make of that what-you-will. So, it isn't a stretch to see the similarities in how corporations devalue human-life with that of a serial-killer. There are similarities in-psychology here, such as viewing people as nothing-more than objects (which Bateman does on numerous-occasions, including watching porn) to be used as one wishes. Maybe this is the heart of horror in ""American Psycho"", both the novel and the film.Ellis's novel came out of his being immersed in this New York-environment (Harron lived there at the time too), and he spent more time than he cared-for with people who shared the attitudes of the Bateman character. He saw murder as a short-step from the amorality and immorality of the Wall Street playboys, and Patrick Bateman can be viewed as a composite and abstraction of these types. By 1987, the stock-market crashed--it was the other Black Friday. Without New Deal controls and protections, we would likely have had another Great Depression (wait, the other-one is coming). 1987 was also the year that Iran-Contra was revealed, and the 1980s-dream which was a nightmare for many. The Reagan-80s were over. And yet, it all continues today in-spades: the corruption, the murder, the lies, and the amorality of those who feed on us. It is significant that the film ends in 1987, and that Bateman has ""learned nothing"". Horror-indeed.",American Psycho

Loses touch a bit in the last reel, though, but not enough to make it standard fare. Simply brilliant! And by the way, that's **** for my Rules of Attraction comment. I urge you to give Patrick Bateman a chance.. or are you afraid you might like it? ""Is that Ivana Trump?!""**** / *****",American Psycho

And that's what I liked about it. It makes you think. It's about so many things which made it in some part a little confusing but overall you see a great comedy, horror and drama.

331,nexus-37,Great horror-comedy made of a great book,9,23 May 2006,"Christian Bale does great casting in this funny, sarcastic and sick comedy. Although lot of scenes were taken directly from the book, this is totally different. Yes, there is Bateman, Louis, Evelyn and others but putting this together as a movie makes it truly humorous. Book itself wasn't so humorous, lot of sarcasm painted with black humor and sick stuff all over detailed, still this movie isn't much of a horror movie at all.For those who hadn't read the book...It's late in 1980s. Movie follows the story of a 27 years old Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street broker with lots of money and nothing to lose. Patrick is kind of a person that doesn't care about anything, doesn't get any satisfaction of anything, self-hatred, schizophrenic person and doesn't like anybody. Still he is wearing his mask of sanity to spread in, not to be noticed too much in the crowd so that he can execute his sick fantasies for real. Or does he..? Very much fun watching, great characters, great directing, never really losing to touch. Some people just can't understand this movie. It's a movie you shouldn't take too seriously and still, you haven't to be empty-minded while watching.This is good.Great movie, 9/10. Anyway I recommend first reading the book, then watching the movie. I don't think I'd get it at all if I hadn't read book first.Truly worth of watching for most people and of course horror-movie fans especially.",American Psycho

333,HiddenVoice,Pure Disturbing/Shocking character study with a touch of dark humor.,8,11 September 2006,"A pure disturbing character study.It is a fantastic,brilliantly executed film.I watched this film so many times that I sometimes feel like Bateman does.Towards the end,the film gets really confusing,and starts to make no sense.Bateman's scenes and his actions towards the end don't relate to the plot and force you to scratch your head.But You have to pay strict attention to Bateman's narration earlier in the film about him being totally lost and not knowing how to fit in.Not knowing who he is from the inside.He reveals a part of him and why he is so confused.He may just be another corporate asshole and sometimes provocative person but deep inside,there is this sinister being trying to come out.Trying to take over him.His inhumanity desperately want to come out.And he loses control of that and becomes an entity,not a being like everyone,but just a lost entity.He is not in particular,scary.Unlike Hannibal or Norman Bates,he is more of a lost soul trying search for meaning of his existence in a wrong sense of way.He is funny and at times really out of control.He is never presented as terrifying character but only a character anatomy.His jealously towards others who are better than him makes him bitter from the inside.He hates to see people having the same things as he does,and if they are better than him,he just wants to kill them.He hates being touched,as he thinks his body is pure and clean.He wants to fit in,and be on top.He loathes seeing people being better than him.Getting better business cards than him.He adores what Ed Gein does.If he were a person of another race ,which may be less respected,then his actions would make sense.But he is like everyone else and yet he thinks he is not like everyone.He still thinks he is under-appreciated.There is this silent evil whispering in his body ,waiting to be unleashed.His favorite dish is women.There is humor surrounding him and that makes it ever more entertaining and enjoyable to watch Bale perform this character.Bale gives a riveting performance.It's impossible to think of any other actor playing that character.He has it all to relate to that character,both mentally and physically.He is the character.He continues to impress and the critics continue to under appreciate him or overlook his performances for an Oscar.This and the performance in THE MACHINIST was his towering achievement and he still doesn't get recognized by the Academy.This man is a striking actor.His portrayal of Bateman is the best inhumane and sadistic performance since Norman Bates.He was just simply pitch perfect in the role.His physique and psychology blends so well with the character.Genius! Harron has perfectly assembled a character study that is both disturbing and mesmerizing.It's an eerie stroke of genius.The script is powerful and stays true to its source.A fascinating blend of demon within and attractiveness.She presents Bate exactly how he should be presented.His character's essence is purely captured.Pure beauty of this beast.She goes deep into his thoughts and meditates on what his view of the world is.She brings you to a disgusting world of an ordinary looking man,who isn't as ordinary as it seems.It's well worth praising for her effort.A stroke of genius.This dark horror thriller with a touch of humor really is perfect for your appetite.That is of course,if you're as sardonic as Bateman himself.Highly Recommended.",American Psycho
334,Ysman,An intelligent look at the book that couldn't possibly be filmed. . .,7,15 April 2000,"The problem with Ellis's book was one with the public.  People couldn't get past all of the violence and sex to see the underlying messages and themes of the book.  American Psycho, the novel, was a satire on the decadent lifestyle of the 80's and its trappings.  Of course the consequences were taken to extremes but its point was well made.  American Psycho, the movie, is a well done adaptation of the novel with only a few shortcomings.  Unlike the terrible movie, Less Than Zero, American Psycho stays true to the general fell and ideas of the novels. The sex and violence, while not completely removed, was not as explicit in the book.  Bale is superb as Patrick Bateman, although the Bateman that I envisioned from reading the novel was quite different and I suppose that was the main flaw of the film for me.  While reading the novel, Bateman was much more sinister to me, much more evil.  In the movie, Bateman seems to understand that what he really wants is to be accepted and to be seen as the best.  In the book, he was much more sure of himself.  All in all, I thought the movie was really well done, however it will face the same problems as the novel.  People won't be able to get past all of the violence and sex to see the underlying messages and themes of the film.  American Psycho is not for everyone, but it is a fine film.",American Psycho

337,ironcraftleague,A great character study.,9,9 January 2019,"I love the character of Patrick Bateman and how the movie goes deeper and deeper into his mind. When he goes insane you feel the dread, suspense, and murderous intention out of someone you thought was trustful. Aside from that, a lot of things are done well. Such as his murder spree which was a great touch of action and overall carnage that felt controlled yet totally savage (you can kinda sum up the feel of the film by saying that). However, things weren't explain that I still didn't get which made me a little disappointed. Why was this big confession nothing? How did the cops not find him? It's kinda open ended, which could be smart, but it feels a little lazy. I'd if they explained those small details, but I could understand due to run time. Still a little upsetting though. 9/10.",American Psycho

339,Gjay2,fab fab fab,8,14 February 2002,"I've read the book, which was fantastic, so i, like most fans of the book, i expected the film to be an endless gore fest, focussing on the incredibly dark nature of Patrick Bateman. But, Mary Harron goes in a completely different way. Instead, she goes comedy, continually mocking the yuppies that plagued Wall Street. These people who have to fit in, where the people you're seen with and places you eat in are very very important. And the truth is, it works unbelievably well. Pat Bateman is the butt of the jokes, a man so scared of not fitting in, that his sanity is slipping fast. Killing for fun is his hobby. Throughout the comedy, there are plenty of dark moments to keep the hardcore fans happy, yet even they are done with a giggle. The film though would not be so good if it wasn't for Mary Harron. The Direction is first class, never rushing to tell the story, the camera work is marvellous, knowing when to move and when to keep still, it works perfectly, building an unparralelled atmosphere. But i have been saving the best till last. Two words, Christian Bale. He injects so much into this character, making him so very chilling and ridiculously funny with just the slightest of facial movements. His eyes say everything and that is a talent to behold. It's his dead pan deliveries ""i know my behavior can be a little...erratic sometimes"" that make you fear him like death, and somehow make you burst out giggling too. The scenes between the detective and Patrick create sparks too, the way he goes from a cold, emotionless being to a dribbling sweating and nervous moron is superb. Very Good marks all round, it leaves a few questions in the end but it's worth all the confusion in the world. An underrated masterpiece.",American Psycho
340,citizenchris,American Psycho and movies based on novels.,7,18 April 2004,"I'm a movie guy, what can I say. I wish I were `well read', I'm just not a book guy. That's not to say I'm an illiterate boob. I enjoy a good novel every now and then. But usually I rely on the printed page for books of the non-fiction variety.  I'm almost always irritated when I hear some snob complaining how the movie they just saw wasn't as good as the book. You know what I'm talking about. At one point in you life you have been on one side of one of those kinds of conversations. I'm usually on the side that says.'well I don't know about the book but the movie was swell' or `well I don't know about the book but the movie sucked' Either way I feel that a movie should be judged on its own merits. The two art forms, novels and films, are completely different.  At least I that's how I felt before I read Bret Easton Ellis's novel `American Psycho'. I picked it up because I was in love with the film. I sorta went into the whole experience of reading the novel expecting it to be a sort of `un-cut' version of the film. This intrigued me a great deal. Needless to say upon reading this great novel I came away less a fan of the film and more a fan of the printed work. The novel sort of ruined the film for me. And I in subsequent conversations with my pals I ended up on the other side of that afore mentioned book to film comparison conversation. I remember viewing my DVD of American Psycho right after I completed the novel and being completely disappointed. It now seemed that so much of Patrick's character arc was just ignored. His relationship with Jean his secretary was entirely ignored.  Characters names were seemingly arbitrarily changed. There wasn't enough narration, after the entire book was told almost completely from Patrick's narration. And that one scene in the film where Jean reads his journal and finds the macabre sketches seemed a complete betrayal of the story's first person nature. My problem at the time was that I was making all the comparisons that I think shouldn't be made when a film is adapted from a novel. The theatrical film medium is extremely limited in the narrative it is capable in bringing forth to the audience. Traditionally you get 2 to 3 hours and you have to rely on what is primarily a visual medium to adapt a written one. That is one thing most filmmakers and audiences forget. Filmmakers rarely utilize the picture tells a thousands words school of filmmaking and stoop to cheesy music and bad dialogue to get the point across. This is true for most films nowadays let alone those based on novels. And audiences foolishly expect a scene-by-scene adaptation of their favorite literary work. Once I re-examined my criticism I viewed the film sever times over. I came to the conclusion that it is indeed a good adaptation. It is brilliant how they incorporated the music review chapters. I also realized its not that the violence in the film is a watered down version from the book. It's more that those ultra-violent scenes are simply not in the film. When you think about its amazing how much of the book Marry Haron and Guinevere Turner managed to fit into their script. The answering scene confession stands out as one of the best scenes in recent memory. Bale deserved some recognition for this scene alone.So what we are left with is a good film with a verry Kubrick like feel. A film with amazing performances and witty dialogue, much of which was lifted strait from the novel. Though many of my complaints still stand, they don't ruin what is otherwise a worthwhile movie experience. One could do much worse when choosing a Friday night rental.",American Psycho

345,Billiam-4,Brilliant,7,20 February 2000,"AMERICAN PSYCHO is Mary Harron's second feature film after her acclaimed I SHOT ANDY WARHOL(and an episode for the TV series Homicide). Her movie has been long in the making, frequently having been discussed, because the studio obviously wanted Leonardo Di Caprio for the leading role of the young big business executive who is - for a pastime- also a serial killer. Harron was opposed to this casting decision and she managed to get Christian Bale whose greatest role till now might have been as Little Jim in Spielberg's EMPIRE OF THE SUN. I read Bret Easton Ellis's infamous novel and must admit I was quite bored. It is an endless succession of what Mr. Bateman wears, uses for his hygiene, what he eats and what he thinks about everything in general, all in a disgusting yuppie pseudo-smartass tone. His very drastically described massacres hardly contribute to making the book more accessible. Mary Harron, however, accomplished the amazing: a movie which is much better than the book! Here she has found a style to envision Bateman's vanity, delicately focusing on the empty icons of this strange society of yuppie executives and staging it slightly as satire with many occasions for the audience to get a laugh. This is something which Ellis is completely incapable of, but probably had intended. The best scenes are where the guys compare their business cards and everyone is envious of the other's, although they all look more or less the same. Bateman eventually kills one of his colleagues for just the reason that his card looks more exclusive. Bateman's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde personality slowly intermingles so that, at the end, he cannot  distinguish between the two sides of his existence anymore. Although his hideous crimes, artfully staged by Harron between horror and hilarity, can't be overseen anymore, the people around him are so vain that they don't even notice what's happening. As Bateman realizes at the end: ""My confession means nothing at all"", so has the film managed to show us that his existence is just the same. In a small role as Bateman's secretary, Chloe Sevigny is well cast, as always a bit sleepy and slow, but just perfect in this movie. One detail I really liked especially: I always knew that Nouvelle Cuisine was nothing but disgusting and an insult to true cuisine culture. I'll give 10/10",American Psycho
346,bobbyelliott,Original and interesting movie,8,10 November 2000,"Bateman is a young urban professional (yuppie) who is full of contradictions. He simultaneously adores himself and hates himself. He is surrounded by ""friends"" but is utterly alone. He preaches about the poor but kicks a down-and-out to death. He complains about the objectification of women but watches pornography. He enjoys (and analyses the lyrics of) popular love songs while engaging in violent sex. The movie can be viewed at two levels - as a traditional (and often funny) slasher movie or an allegory of contemporary American society.",American Psycho

That's really just Bale's great performance though. In addition, the overall dryness and shallow feeling nature given off from the other actors is something that makes it funnier, and one of the my favorite comedies.",American Psycho
348,d_fienberg,Shocking only in its mediocrity...,5,11 November 2000,"I may be in a decided minority in feeling that Mary Harron has, thus far, built a career on draining all excitement from her material. I Shot Andy Warhol featured a number of interesting performances and a fine script, but the direction completely dulled any of the fun that you would expect from the Warhol Factory and its hangers-on. Similarly, with her adaptation of American Psycho, Harron has gotten a number of fine performances from her cast, and the writing seems sharp, but the direction is so completely without the necessary flair that it seems largely lacking as a whole.Bret Easton Ellis's novel of Yuppie Decadence was only barely cutting edge when it came out. Readers have mistake Ellis's flamboyant writing style for substance, ignoring the fact that even in the mid to late 80s, social critics didn't really feel like the decade had much depth. The book is a violent satire that naysayers misread as literal, but which its cult (and it seems that thousands of people still love the book for whatever reason) have mistaken for profound. However, say what you will about it's quality, the book is either a fantastic success or a thunderous failure. It's hard to be ambivalent.Harron's movie, though, can easily produce a ho-hum reaction. It seems counterproductive to mention it, but it's almost unavoidable to think of what might have happened had the film been made by Oliver Stone and Leonardo DiCaprio, who were both rumoured to be interested at one point. Stone would have been the perfect director to handle the material for better or for worse. In my opinion, Stone probably would have made a horrible, flashy, loud, misguided movie, much in the tradition of Brian DePalma's awe-inspiringly wrong-headed Bonfire of the Vanities. But he could have made the film another Wall Street, a brilliant satire. Similarly, it's very possible that DiCaprio would have been so miscast as to make the film laughable. Or he may have given a wonderful and unexpected performance. Regardless, the film would have been alive.It's not really Harron's fault that the material is dated. Ellis at least was working in his contemporary milieu. Some of his observations may have seemed biting. For Harron to mine humour from the killer's passion for Phil Collins seems counter productive. The jokes are just obvious. American Psycho has no more currency than any other piece of 80s parody or nostalgia. It's more like Romy and Michelle Kill Everyone at Their High School Reunion.But the film still remains watchable. And, even more surprising,  after being forced to watch the film a second time, it didn't get any worse, as such surface glosses often tend to. Christian Bale's performance is a comedic masterwork, a super combination of flawlessly dark line readings and chilling physical comedy. Bale certainly has never had so much fun in a film before and it's doubtful that he'll ever get such juicy material again. Willem Defoe is similarly relishes his role as a slightly daffy private eye. However, in keeping with the piece, much of the rest of the cast seems to be sleepwalking through their performances. Samantha Mathis, Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, and Jared Leto all play desicated characters, so it isn't surprising that none of them have the chance to do their best work.American Psycho is violent, but not overwhelmingly so. It's sexual, but not enough to really offend anybody. And it's intense, but probably not enough to endanger old hearts. The question with Ellis's book was always whether or not it could be adapted for the screen. Well, clearly it can be. The only question remaining is whether Mary Harron should have bothered.I'd give it a generous 6/10, largely because it didn't bore me the second time around.",American Psycho
349,Bek204,"""This confession has meant nothing""",7,31 October 2020,"A wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman, hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies. (Via IMDb)American Psycho is a really good and classic movie especially that it has so many scenes that will get stuck in your head. It also has very long monologues and dialogues that were not boring at all which makes the film unique.First, Christian Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman was incredible and Oscar-worthy, he was able to impersonate that weird, insane and psycho character so well by his actions, his facial expressions, and the way he speaks. William Defoe's performance was good as well, he always puts on great performances, Defoe's character in the movie was there to kind of provide extra suspense which was great because it gave the whole story a better taste. Although he did not appear that much in the movie, Jared Leto's performance was great as well, loved his character, and loved how he played it.The movie has so many great scenes that are ""classic"" and no argument of how incredible these scenes are, for example, the very famous ""Hip To Be Square"" scene, the ""Chainsaw"" scene that came off so great at the end, Bale running through a hallway butt naked, wearing sneakers and holding a chainsaw, that scene was one of the best, or the ""Morning Routine"" scene that is my favorite scene in the movie.Really loved how the movie uses some of the ""symbols"" to present the different themes of the film, for instance, the business card that every time Bateman sees one that is better than his, he goes crazy. The videotapes too, and we all know that famous line: ""I have to return some videotapes"".In addition, The film's runtime of 1h 40min was perfect. I feel like if the movie's runtime was more than 1h 50min, it would have been boring and it would have been filled with unnecessary/long/boring events.In the end, the movie was good but I really expected more, I really think that the script could have been better. I feel like if they changed the narrating way of the story then the result would have been way better. I'm not saying that this way was bad but I just expected more. The ending was perfect especially that people until this day are not quite sure of it, was all of that in Bateman's head, or did Bateman really commit all these crimes?My rating is: 7.5/10",American Psycho

351,asphyxion_,Excellent Self Indulgence that isn't so mindless,9,23 December 2019,"I love American Psycho. It's excessive in every way: from the violence to the sexual situations and fantasies, to its blatant dialogue exchanges, to its senseless murderous rampaging violence, but mostly it's excessive in its malignant consumeristic narcissism. And one can't help but feel that the excessive narcissism is exactly the point of the entire film. It's almost as if the movie itself is an actual cinematic-embodiment of the personality disorder that Patrick Bateman so heavily suffers from. American Psycho also does an amazing job at encapsulating all the base desires of the male psyche, and then amplifying them in an almost poetic way to paint the perfect picture of who exactly Bateman is and just how insane he can truly be. And what makes the entire thing so effective is how easily possible the movie makes one realize that any man could be driven to be such an egotistical jacka$$ if given the right circumstances in life.There's also a lot of subtle but perfect dark humor in the film. Especially the  contest that is the Business Card Show and Tell that the men engage in periodically. You'll notice how everyone is a ""Vice President"" -- an obvious jab at the crony corporate nepotism on Wall Street/big business and how the 'higher ups' are really just useless drones who do nothing. Case in point: Patrick telling his secretary to hold all his calls for the day because he'll be too swamped with work, but then immediately kicking his feet up on the desk and turning Jeopardy on on the television as soon as his secretary leaves the office and closes his door.What surprises me the most about American Psycho is that it was directed and written by women. It's not that I think women are incapable of creating good movies, but more that the subject content of the film/script is drenched in testosterone and misogyny, so it ultimately feels like it was crafted by men. Then again, in retrospect it probably took a woman's touch to really show the absurdity of Bateman's extremely toxic masculinity and malignant narcissism in its absurdist and repugnant light. A male director/writer team probably would have made Bateman a more sympathetic egoist, and I'm sure that defeats the entire point of what the movie is really trying to say in the first place.My only gripe with the film is with the casting of Bateman. Don't get me wrong, Christian Bale did an incredible job but its not without warranted criticism. Bateman's tangents into the ridiculous by way of prolific verbal dissertations on Huey Lewis and The News or Phil Collins, while freakin' hilarious, feel a little too forced. And that forced feeling is a consistent issue throughout the movie--Bateman's excessive egotism doesn't always feel natural, and it ultimately mars the film's immersion/continuity. I read a review that suggest Charlie Sheen as Patrick Bateman, and honestly I couldn't imagine a more perfect real-life egotistical maniac to portray Bateman. Charlie Sheen from Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" with Patrick Bateman's book personality would have been excellent here.Ultimately, the movie doesn't really spoonfeed you a conclusion (although it gives you hints throughout the entire film) and so its ambiguity gives it a more intellectual bent to its portrayal of insane cathartic self indulgence. I'm of the mind that everything was in Bateman's head and he truly is crazy, but both sides of the argument have valid reasons for why they either do or do not believe Bateman really did what we saw on the screen. This and the fact that the movie clocks in at just a hair over 100 minutes and you've got a highly rewatchable piece of entertainment. 9/10 Solid A rating",American Psycho
352,LaoagMikey,OK movie with no ending,5,2 November 2017,"I wanted to rate this movie higher but could not. I have two things I expect a movie to do. Tell me a story and have a satisfying ending. This one told a rambling story but had no satisfying ending. There were some good parts. There is a short monologue at the beginning where he talks about all of the ablutions he uses on his face and body and it was just getting tedious when it had a good ending line. Too bad the same was not true for the movie.The voice over at the end even tells you that nothing happened, nothing changed. So why did we spend money to watch a movie where nothing changed? No idea! That's why it got a 5 from me. Right now, I am thinking it should be 4 but the cinematography was good. 1 point. Everything was in focus. +1 point. The sound was good +1 point. And the audio was good +1 point. So that gets us to 4. So why 5? Not sure. Maybe that it did not run overly long. It certainly was a combinations of several killer styles. Finding a gas powered chain saw in a modern, New York apartment was odd. And throwing it at someone about 50 feet away and hitting them was odd. It is a noisy affair. One could hear it coming and move enough to avoid it. Maybe that's some of that satire that someone mentioned. It was lost on me. It just looked stupid! Some of the characters were almost embarrassing to watch. Cringeworthy is a modern term for it. They made me nervous watching them. Maybe that was part of the effect the director intended. Keep the viewer on edge. Sorry, it did not work on me.See it if you must but don't expect an ending. Don't expect to feel like you got anything for your money and/or time.

One has to feel something about at least the major characters to be drawn in or carried along. If one can feel anything for this guy or any of his ""pals,"" blow-up sex dolls, or victims, I'd be surprised. That was the magic of ""No Country for Old Men.""

360,ufo0001,Makes Bret Easton Ellis' novel accessible,10,1 May 2002,"Pros: Sets, Black humor, Cinematography.Cons: Lack of characterization from minor characters, Gratuitous violence and sex, needs repeated viewings to get the humor.American psycho is a satire for eighties greed based on the novel of the same name. Folks, Christian Bale probably gives one of the best performances of that year as the psychopathic banker Patrick Bateman. Most people hated this movie because they felt the main character was a jerk and was mean to women. But if dissected carefully, you begin to find out that patrick bateman is really just an end product to reaganism. For example, evidence is given in the movie that most of the violence is imagined in bateman's head and he really imagines himself committing crimes but cannot bring himself to actually do it. Also he is never shown working so one can be skeptical in his role in the office and whether he is really important. Plus, he always has his name mistakened for another coworker by another character and this leads to some funny situations. Marry harron does a good job of directing this anti-female novel and Guinevere Turner has to be given kudos for adapting a difficult movie. The real praise should be lavished on Christian bale as he personifies Patrick Bateman. Loaded with unintentional( or intentional) black humor, this is one of the funniest movies of the year. With such classic lines as ""I had to kill a lot of people"" and memorable scenes, American psycho never gets stale with repeated viewing. Some people have complained about the last thirty minutes but I think it is important to showing just how much of a psycho bateman really is. His friends, although make brief appearances are hilarious and some of the imagined murders do nothing but bring laughter to your facePremise: Patrick Bateman is wanted in the connection of the death of Paul Allen, a coworker.American Psycho received no Academy awards but got critical Kudos.Grade: 10/10 (American masterpiece)",American Psycho
361,adam111111,Disturbing but aesthetic. Mostly the former.,5,26 June 2017,"I have some very mixed feelings about American Psycho. It is, on the one hand, a profoundly disturbing movie that seems pornographic in its depictions of sex and violence. On the other hand, it is a beautifully executed film with eye-catching cinematographic grace. (Christian Bale is scarily attractive as he works out in his immaculate tighty-whities and as he murders. Not to mention that scene where he looks at his own gorgeously toned body in the mirror while having sex two ill-fated women.)The role of the unreliable narrator is also very interesting. By the end of the film, the movie's comedic elements are coming to the fore as the audience comes to realize that the phantasmagoria of sex and violence was more fantasy than reality.I have very mixed feelings about the movie as a whole. I was left with an intense feeling of disgust after seeing this movie, but I can understand why someone else might like it.That person is not me though, and the feeling of disgust hasn't left.(I saw this on June 20, 2017)",American Psycho
362,johnmichael-2,"Better than the book, but that's not saying much",8,5 January 2008,"I love books, and I always think you should read a book before you watch the movie; or, if failing that, you should read the book sometime after. But, for the first time and probably the last time, I am telling you: if you want ""American Psycho"" skip the book ENTIRELY! This is a review of the movie, not the book, so I'll start with what the movie did right as opposed to what the book did wrong. Firstly, I'm glad Mary Harron directed this, because a woman is sometimes better able to satirize the egos and self-posturing of men simply because she isn't one; she has an objective viewpoint. In the first hour especially we see Patrick Bateman's weaknesses as he tries desperately to appear richer than his coworkers. He applies more lotions and creams than a stereotyped gay man, he actually cares whether his business cards looks better than those of his friends, and he is enraged with jealousy when he finds out that Paul Allen's apartment is even richer than his. ""I'm trying to fit it!"" he snaps at his girlfriend, Evelyn.Who is this Paul Allen? He is one of the early victims of Patrick Bateman, murdered with an ax. Bateman, see, has a peculiarly strong bloodlust that is even stronger than his lust for music and opulence. He kills people an awful lot and really enjoys it. And he has not a scrap of remorse; the only emotions he can feel are greed and disgust.The last half-hour, however, reveals the weakness of the source material. The ending in the book was a mishmash mess of epic proportions, and in following it the movie can only make it so much better. It is when the viewer realizes, though not as acutely as while reading the book, that a serial killer is such a stock character that no halfway-decent person can ever hope to portray accurately. Not even Christian Bale's great acting can fully dispel the fact that Bret Easton Ellis had no idea how to make a convincing antihero.Now that we're on the subject of the book, here's my chance to explain how the film improved it. First of all, the book was just too long. It was endless in its descriptions of the yuppie lifestyle--so endless, in fact, that I felt I would kill myself if I ever saw the words ""Argyle socks"" or ""Ralph Saint-Laurent"" again. Thankfully, Mary Harron (and her co-writer Guinevere Turner) have condensed the first 100 pages of the novel into their appropriate 10 minutes. They have let Patrick's love for music show itself through the dialogue and acting rather than spending whole chapters' worth of material describing various bands. They also managed to introduce Detective Donald Kimball within 30 minutes when Ellis took 2/3 of the book to get there. While Ellis' horrid editor saw fit not to excise any of the endless tracks of puffed-up prose, the medium of film required it to be cut, and it was automatically an improvement.Yet if Mary Harron improved the pacing and the satire, she didn't manage to improve the killing scenes. While Ellis committed the sin of going too far, she committed the sin of not going far enough. Since Ellis's style hinted at an ego bigger than Patrick Bateman, the pornographic scenes of fantastical murder were horrible to read--not at all disturbing, just plain ridiculous. But Mary Harron didn't go far enough; it was as if she was purposely trying to avoid the dreaded NC-17; though of course she got it anyway and had to cut 17 seconds from the threesome. And yet she could have gone a lot farther. She was doing a satire, not a puffed-up fantasy like Ellis, so a great deal of violence would have been a lot more excusable. I am not saying that more gore would have made the movie better; I'm saying that she needn't have handled the scenes so gingerly.In all, a fair film. I think I would have appreciated it a bit more, however, if I had never read the book, because my hatred for Ellis' pile of crap did leak over a little into my movie experience. Which is why I'm telling you: if you want to experience ""American Psycho"", skip the book and go directly the movie. That's the first time you've heard me say that, and it'll probably be the last.",American Psycho
363,Time Tripper,The mind of the mindless...,4,9 December 2000,"This movie had potential, except the main character is a total waste of time.  Malcolm McDowell in ""A Clockwork Orange"" was only about one thousand times more interesting.  Perhaps if he was obsessed with Beethoven, instead of Phil Collins and Huey Lewis...? (This next sentence may or may not be a spoiler.)  And, let's face facts here, the main character is a very, very stupid, boring, and pathetic man, who just happens to have violent fantasies and sleep around.  Most of the violence in the movie was off-camera, so I can't say it was really too graphic.  This is a really hard movie to pin down, because you know it is a satire, but there's no humor.  Compared to movies like ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Fight Club,"" this movie fails miserably.",American Psycho
364,ShinKyo81,Brilliant film for a brilliant novel!!,9,29 August 2001,"First, I saw ""American Psycho"" at the cinema. I found the film weird but brilliant, because I liked the way the US society was criticized.
Then, I took the novel ""American Psycho"" of Bret Easton Ellis and I read it in a few days, because I couldn't get away from that book. I really enjoyed reading the novel, so I decided to rent the film and watch it again, in order to compare between the movie and the book, looking for parts of the novel not included in the film. My big surprise when I realized that most of the dialogues in the movie were exactly the same words in the book (this explains that ""deja vu"" sensation I had reading the book ^_^). And that's a thing that doesn't normally happen. Just read Michael Crichton's ""Lost World"" and compare it with the film... You'll see what I mean...""American Psycho"" shows to the audience the emptiness of the society, the wisdom's mask that everybody wear to hide our darkest side. But for Patrick Bateman, a 27 year-old handsome guy, it's getting really tough to keep that mask on... But Patrick Bateman is not a poor worker, or a homeless: he works at Wall Street and earns $200.000 a year. In a world of expensive restaurants, night parties, cocaine, top models and lots of money, Bateman realizes how empty his life is.The film is truely an exercise of style, a mixture of comedy, thriller and terror. Christian Bale is outstanding as Patrick Bateman, he steals all the interpretation in the film. Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto are also there, but they don't shine like Bale.All the Bateman's monologues are incredible, literally taken from the Bret Easton Ellis' book. And the soundtrack is brilliant too. If you like 80's-early 90's music, prepare to listen to Phil Collins, Huey Lewis and the News, Withney Houston and many more!Just an advice: read the book, then watch the money, you will enjoy it much more! 9 out of 10",American Psycho

366,bastiaan0740,It hits its mark,9,1 October 2008,"The movie itself has a weak plot. It's about a guy who kills people. Then the movie basically ends. So why is it so good?Well, for starters the environment. All this insanity takes place with upper-class people. This adds a special dimension to the scenario. People are unable to acknowledge the situation, or deal with it - or they simply don't want to. Even Bateman himself. He can't control the murders, and even confessing them doesn't work. At the beginning, Bateman states he has no real persona. And indeed he hasn't got one. Odd thing is, having no personality, is a personality of its own. This angle is played out brilliantly. Bateman succeeds in interesting us with trivia on what lotions he uses, his feelings on business cards, apartment locations, and music preferences. Then he murders for no reason. Detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe) is another masterpiece. He's on the hunt for the killer. After watching the movie, I read the trivia. It states Kimball's scenes were shot 3 times. One thinking Bateman was the killer. One thinking he wasn't. One not knowing either way. And all Kimball's present scenes were a mix. This is exactly how I perceived it, even before reading the trivia. It makes for a great effect. Kimball's tampered personality mixes great with Bateman's surreal one. The acting is brilliant as well. Bateman (Christian Bale) has no problem portraying the variety of extreme emotions. 9/10.",American Psycho

Scary as scary can be, I could't possibly think of watching this film twice. It was brilliantly done. Christian Bale was phenomenal in his portrayal. But, the graphic violence is just too believable to view again. I found it to be one of the scariest films I've ever viewed, because it was without a doubt believable in its writing, acting, and execution.What makes his blood bath even the more scary is that no one knows who anyone is in this film.

371,dillylamar,American Psycho,10,24 June 2020,"American Psycho is a 2000 film directed by Mary Harron, adapted for the screen by Mary Harron, and based off of the novel of the same name. This film is a cult classic, as it's dark humor, ridiculousness, bloody violence, horror film traits, and insanely quotable moments mix well with its satire and criqie of collective identity, individuality consumerism, capitalism, and yuppie culture. Bale's breakout performance in the film is absolutely phenomenal and iconic. The main themes of the film are lack of individuality, collective identity becoming personal identity, the greed and self indulgence of those in high society, and what a psychopath can get away with in a world like this. All of the men on Wall street look and act the exact same. They are interchangeable, as are the women. That's why people constantly get names mixed up in the film, and that ends up saving Bateman. Bateman only cares about other view him. He is in a constant hunger for conformity and to be seen as better, as he ends up killing Paul Allen because he had a better business card than him. He has been killing for a long time, and has been able to maintain, but starts to breakdown. The film is about how we form a collective identity, pretty much losing our individuality and personal identity. We crave attention, material wealth, conformity and to be seen as better. Bateman does. So do the others. At the end of the film he realizes that nothing including himself really matter, everyone is the same. He is so indulged in a collective identity, that his lawyer mistakes him for someone else, obliterating his confession. No one cares that he kills people, no one even notices. He can get away with anything, even if your a serial killer/psychopath. because he has sold himself a collective identity. He puts value into material things like restaurants, suits, watches, cards, and apartments. He listens to cheesy pop music because its trendy, but much more value into it, than it really holds. He views the homeless and lower classes to be less than him, he just kills them. In this type of high society, the people lose their individuality and distungishable traits, and just become greedy, power hungry, emotionless, interchangeable and unoticable nothings. The only difference between Bateman and his banker colleagues, is that he kills people. But everyone is so wrapped up in themselves and collective identity, that they dont notice. Bateman sees women as meat or objects, and men as something to be better than.At the end of the film, after his breakdown, Bateman realize that he and everyone else he knows is meaningless, interchangeable, and that he can get away with anything. He can Indulge in his murderous hunger all he wants. He presents himself in the collective identity, fitting in losing all sense of self. It will go on. He becomes more and more hungry and uncontrollable and his private life becomes integrated into his professional, and he realizes that he take it, and get away with it, there is more to take. Don' become a Patrick Bateman. He craves to stand out and be better. His view of himself is skewed by his psychosis, inflated ego and sociopatheology. His fantasy and reality become jaded, mixed, and goes insane because he can't really tell the difference. His killings all happend, but some are partial truths, or over aesthetically elaborate type chainsaw massacre killings. He so disconnected and detached from reality.",American Psycho

Movie has no hero, no nemesis, no direction. Audience does not know what to expect. I would say the whole story is comparable to a movie like ""The Great Gatsby"" a pointless body of motion picture trying to lure audience with scenes of ultra rich extravaganza! Movie is mostly talking heads with limited action, 75%+ of the movie is plain exposition, explaining everything but something relevant to the movie, absolutely nothing to root for. OK, it is a motion picture about the daily life of a rich psycho who kills people... so what? What is the message? What is the resolve? Where is the structure? Screenplay never followed the approved Hollywood guidelines, one simple flat line from start to finish so I wonder how did it pass the studio executives into production. The exposition was so weak that the audience may not realize that the movie occurs in late 80s not early 2000s, apparently the director assumed that everybody read the book and now wishes to see it on big screen.

He has an Ivy League education, a top-flight job, good looks, confidence, fine taste in food, and a disciplined workout regimen. But there is something askew with him. Although Bateman is perfect in every way, he is perfect in all of the same ways as everyone else in his social circles. In achieving everything that is expected of him in society, he has become anonymous.Well, Patrick is going to do something about that!If you lived through the selfishness and materialism of the 1980s, this movie will crack you up as it horrifies you. I gave this film an excellent rating for its depiction of hilariously superficial Harvard-educated Wall Street types. This is not the usual depiction of the smug rich as comical boobs, but as deeply twisted and fundamentally empty people. In my experience, the latter depiction is closer to the truth.The main character's complete self-obsession is illustrated through his egotistical practices. These range from his endless physical workouts and ""metro-sexual"" attention to his looks, to his ravenous desire for sex and violence. The on-screen sex could offend more sensitive American viewers, and th on-screen violence will offend most European viewers.

IS IT ANY GOOD?
YES.Although the violence is played down, the satire brought upfront and what we are left with is, possibly a classic.For those of you who said that it was c**p because there was hardly and blood and was boring, then don't read the book(100 pages pass before the first stabbing,left out in the film) and I recommend Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream films, because they are brainless splatter films.This deals with the darker side of human life.",American Psycho

Let's look at the usual comments and deconstruct them:(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)1=HOLLOW AND NO PLOT= That's the point of the film! It shows the eighties for what it really was, hollow and flat. If there was a plot, then we would not be able to make sense of this movie, it's more like a diary.2=UNNECESSARY VIOLENCE= That is the worst thing that one can accuse this film of. The violence was there for two reasons: to distract you from Bateman's boring yuppie life and to show how everybody else is wrapped up in their own lives to notice anything. ie nobody answering the door when Bateman chases the prostitute with chainsaw.3=NOT ENOUGH BLOOD AND GORE= As I stated in my previous review of this film, this isn't a slasher film. It is an intelligent, and hillarious look at eighties culture. If you want a slasher film, I recommend Friday the 13th movies.4=WHAT WAS THAT ENDING ABOUT?= The biggest cause for debate. Bateman didn't kill anybody during this film. It was all in his head. He clearly is disturbed, but couldn't carry out a killing to save his life. That's why, almost, all of the killings go unnoticed.If, after reading this, you are still not convinced, then read the book by Bret Easton Ellis. After reading it, watch the film wit all this in mind.",American Psycho
378,DylansFearFiles,The Best Satire Since Fight Club,10,13 August 2009,"I like the satire and thriller genres. American Psycho is a spoof of yuppie-culture in the 1980s. The movie is basically about how some people see material possessions as more important than human life, which Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) and his murders symbolize. The movie is based on the controversial bestselling novel by Brett Easton Ellis (Less Than Zero, The Rules of Attraction).Patrick Bateman has everything, a beautiful fiancé (Reese Witherspoon), wealth, a great job at Pierce & Pierce, a big circle of friends, nice clothes and most of all: an addiction to murder. Patrick Bateman descends further and further into insanity as his murder spree goes along. He murders and sometimes rapes colleagues or even strangers without hesitation. This great film also features a great supporting cast including Willem Dafoe as Detective Kimball and Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's secretary, Jean.American Psycho is a disturbing and intelligent trip into the life and exploits of a madman. This is probably Christian Bale's greatest performance, it shocks me that he didn't get an Academy Award nomination. But then again, it isn't that surprising considering that the Academy usually gives their happy movies the awards. Since when has Christian Bale been disappointing?Patrick Bateman is an interesting character. Who is likable at certain points but mostly downright despicable. Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times even praised Bale's performance as ""heroic in the way he allows the character to leap joyfully into despicability; there is no instinct for self-preservation here, and that is one mark of a good actor"". Indeed, he is right.The movie also has a lot of humor. Mainly the humor comes from the character's personalities. Each of these characters that Bateman hangs out with are total embodiments of the many stereotypes about yuppies. American Psycho has even spawned an LARGE cult-following. People on the IMDb message board even constantly quote the film, I have never seen that on any other board here. I guess that just shows how great the movie is. I hope that one day American Psycho earns a spot in the Top 250. I don't see how it hasn't made it yet.American Psycho is also not just about a man running around killing people, like another consumer satire, Chuck Palahnuik's Fight Club (I also recommend the film and the novel of that), American Psycho produces a good and true message about consumer culture and materialism. As I said, it is about how people sometimes see material possessions as even more important than human life.Here is a couple of notes about the fantastic book by Bret Easton Ellis and how it compares to the movie. The movie and the book are both great but the book, as usual, has so much more detail and you hear more of Bateman's sick thoughts. The movie is more like an examination of a sociopath's daily life while the book is basically a descent into Hell. It even starts with the lines from Dante's Inferno, ""Abandon all hope ye who enter here.""This movie almost did not get made. It had developed so much controversy from feminists and animal rights groups before and after it had been published due to its graphic violence. The filmmakers had to remove a lot of the graphic violence and disturbing acts that Patrick Bateman commits (including cannibalism, only mentioned in the movie and necrophilia, both are described in great detail). I wouldn't watch this movie without reading the book. Beware, if you don't have a strong stomach: do not read the book, I found it hard to read on some parts.10/10",American Psycho

In this movie his American accent is nearly flawless (if overdone a bit in spots); the tics, the facial expressions, everything - outstanding! You could really believe that he is Patrick Bateman, crazed killer.However...He was the only thing that held this movie together. There wasn't a single other character that stood out. Everybody else could have been played by ANY-body else.The movie really started to fall apart for me when the shooting spree began. It just went nowhere, and fizzled out in a damp corner. I was left unsatisfied.I will say that I liked the chainsaw interlude, I liked that Jean gets out alive, and I will say again that Christian Bale was fantastic in his loony rage - bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, spewing sometimes but only an implied threat at other times. He did well.Suggestions I would have made? - I think Luis should have had a special torturous death waiting for him, detective Kimball should have almost-but-not-quite bought it at the end, and Patrick should have died a gloriously gore-ific death.This movie is definitely worth seeing, but only because Bale did such a good job. The directing was interesting (up until things went kerflooey...almost like an intern took over the script and directing when the shoot-out began), but I was basically struggling to see what so many others have seen before they sung the praises of this movie.8 out of 10 because of Bale, -2 because the movie fell apart.",American Psycho

First of all, the cast of characters are all WASPs in each book/film- as if the world is devoid of anyone non-caucasian. It's unrealistic and a tad racist, don'tcha think? The only non-caucasians are a homeless man (""Psycho"") and a coked-up drug dealer Rupert (""Rules of Attraction""). Those seem to also be some negative stereotyping. But then again, ALL stereotyping is a tad negative.To me, the film was dreck. I'm surprised it outgrossed its budget for the short lived time it was theatrically released. The movie was boring, and I just didn't identify with Patrick Bateman. Perhaps if I were affluent and living on the East Coast I'd think differently. That seems to be the norm to Easton's characters. What was up with every chick (except the prostitute) all having blonde hair? They were all starting to look the same to me: Reese Witherspoon/Chloe Sevigny/Samantha Manthis/Jared Leto...The only thing this movie had going for it was the production design and the cinematography. No doubt- I thought I was watching outtakes of ""Bright Lights, Big City"". I give the DP major props for the job. Funny how Christian Bale was about 10 when this film was supposed to take place. But after the Willem Dafoe scene, there was no suspense, and the movie just kind of shot itself. So the ending wasn't suspenseful at all. You just sat there and thought, ""I sat through two hours of THAT?"" I'm glad to see that this film was able to garner a straight-to-video, ""American Psycho 2"" and ""...3"". If only the first one did and disappear like a fart in the wind.I'm done.",American Psycho
381,MundaneNoodle,Watered down version of the book,7,13 September 2000,"For those who didn't read the book, the film is a shocking and disturbing film. After reading the book, I was hesitant in seeing the movie, because I knew it would probably be  disappointing and tame in comparison. I was right, although I was relieved that most of the violence is implied, rather than explicit. The torture/murder scenes in the book are sickeningly violent and cruel. Had Quentin Tarantino directed this one, he would have held nothing back, and the movie as whole would be better. The movie comes across as flat, truncated, and very watered down. Christian Bale is great however, a flawless performance as a corporate yuppie without a single human emotion. Read the book, it's got far more shock value and controversy than the movie could ever hope to offer.",American Psycho

384,jackharding89-1,Maul Street...,9,25 May 2008,"Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) has a problem. It's not work. It's not women. It's definitely not money. Nor is it his IQ, looks, shower routine or sense of fashion. You see, Patrick just can't stop killing. Men, women, friends, foes, cats, dogs, you name it he'll slay it. Butcher knives, kitchen knives, nail-guns, hand-guns, axes, chainsaws, coat-hangersyou name it he'll use it. And yes, at a glance, American Psycho may sound, seem and look like your average, banal slasher flick, but it isn't. In fact, it's far from it.Adapted well enough from Brett Easton Ellis' seminal novel, American Psycho is a sharp, blacker than black character driven comedy. Yes, comedy. Comic in that the silkiness of the satire is so finely woven into the somberness of the subject matters (violence, rape, mental- illness, social decay) that the end product is sheer flimic and lyrical porn fit for any cult following. And even though its dry, wry humour may not be for everyone, writer/director Mary Harron's big-screen spin on one of modern fictions' most important texts is wildly entertaining; not as deep or profound or cutting as Ellis' original tale, but as a stand- alone film- it's a success.Like the book, Harron's Psycho is set in a mid-to-late 1980's Manhattan but speaks for today. It centers on the life of 27 year old Wall Street high-flier and our least noble of narrators, Patrick Bateman. A neurotic, athletic, vain and designer-branded emblem of the mass- consuming chauvinists whose focal thoughts involved, well, money, sex and status. But Bateman is going through what can only be described as an identity crisis-cum-killing binge (""I need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale""). His ""mask of sanity"", as he so metaphorically states, is beginning to slip and after taking an axe to one of his firm's finest chief execs', Bateman has to juggle his homicidal, sadomasochistic hobbies with unwanted attention from both Detective Donald Kimble (William Dafoe) and flakey fiancé Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) all the while remaining on the ball at ""work"" and vigorous in his grooming and exercise routines (he can do a thousand stomach crunches y'know).American Psycho, then, is a quite excellent, frivolous yet brain-teasing depiction of the distinct and now laughable mentality of the coke-fueled souls who reveled in the sheer bliss of 1980's pulp pop-culture. Released a decade on from its passing, Harron is able to channel the mindset of so many money-obsessed egomaniacs through just one, all be it extreme, character. And what a character. Bateman is erratic, embarrassing, dangerous, a Whitney Houston nut, Huey Lewis buff and connoisseur of all things mainstream. A character so deeply consumed by himself that he's an important yet utterly ridiculous commitment to fiction; an absolute blast to watch and behold (""I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?"") Christian Bale operates so well within the role of Bateman that it's hard to think of any other actor that could've done a better job. It's a breakthrough performance riddled with humour, horror and meaning; emotion, class and confidence. Not only does the Welshman's captivating performance personify the mood and pacing of the tale, but shuns any memories regarding the likes of Edward Norton and Leonardo Di Caprio being originally cast for the role. He brings Ellis' icon to life and is, perhaps, the finest thing to come out of Harron's adap' (excluding the hilarious business card scene).Credit also has to be given to Harron, though. Converting one of the most violent and controversial novels of all time into a film was never going to be easy. The unproven female director has tailored the tale for the screen well enough, though. It's refreshing to see the female half of the craft take on a film so unconventional, daring and, when the chauvinistic mannerisms of the male lead are taken into account, paradoxical.Harron is able to inject ample substance and candour into particularly violent scenes by positioning the camera just a few inches away from the actual point of visual violence. An effective technique that evokes not visual shock, but mental. Harron demands that we imagine what the camera isn't showing us. Which is often worse thus paying off. Especially in the set-to-be infamous yet cult-embraced ""Huey Lewis and the News"" sequence. Which brings me smoothly onto John Cales' decade-defining soundtrack. Chock full of memorable eighties hits from Robert Palmer to Phil Collins, New Order to Chris De Burgh, Cales' song selection is straight-out of the pages of Ellis' book and is as bolstering to the placement of the tale as the sophisticated, counteracting piano score that overrides Bateman's humorous monologues.As far as black and bold comedies go, American Psycho is right up there with the very best. It's a stylish, ingenious and disturbing revamp of a better book which brings to mind the likes of John Landis, Stan' Kubrick and the Coens. It's a candid, instant-success on behalf of the cast, Mary Harron and Christian Bale especially. Expect more from him.",American Psycho
385,amahlanand,"""Do you feel fulfilled... in your life?""",8,13 May 2012,"This was the sort of film that I doubt will garner universal approval, I wasn't sure myself of whether it registered with me or not. It was a unique take on mental psyche which can delve deep but seem on the surface like a straightforward slasher film. Though, I admired its blend of thriller and satire where it doesn't take itself too seriously yet doesn't descend to a comically inept level by maintaining a certain level of tension. 'American Psycho' gives no importance to anything else but for one man who would be satisfied with the attention: Patrick Bateman, a narcissistic, patronising yuppie who is presented in a most enigmatic fashion, a man who has a high flying life yet idealises something more out of the ordinary. His character paints a picture of blatant and oftentimes comical irony. He shows how self obsession can drive you off an edge, how your mind can be the instigator of absolute insanity and emotions ranging from depression to prime aggression without the need for external influence which Christian Bale portrays starkly well. Simultaneously, he acts as quite the paradox as he acknowledges his plunge into insanity and does little to help himself. The greatest irony though is how, after all his attempts, the story comes full circle where his life is just normal, regardless of what he does. For him, his nocturnal, sociopathic tendencies are all just a game, a simple transgressive indulgence he feels he is entitled to. His motives however are a prime example of the black comedy in the film, they can probably be likened to a young kid throwing a tantrum because other kids have more than him and possessions better than his own. Except Bateman's obsessions with superiority are never too little to kill for.I've never seen a more confused and directionless character, one conflicted by so many emotions and so intricately complex. I can't imagine an author expecting more out of such an absorbingly curious character than Christian Bale brought out in this pinching satire on personal fulfilment and domination. ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman"" his self monologue claims and it's left up to you to examine what you see and decide what it is all about, real or imaginative. Don't expect him to give you a determinate answer though. If provoking thought isn't a show of acting mastery on Bale's part and deserved of honours, I'm not sure what is. Yet, even provoking thought needs to have some sense. Yes indeed, this is deep and elaborate. But good cinema.",American Psycho
386,timelord-3,Read the book first,6,13 August 2000,"Now, I haven't read the Bret Easton Ellis novel on which this film is based. I thought I should get that right out in the open to start with.  Because many of you may wish to stop reading this review right now, because I didn't really like American Psycho, but I somehow think that would be different if Ihad read the book first.This film has been out for a week or so now; even earlier if you caught it at the various film festivals around the country.  I rose out my lethargy to write a review of this film after reading Malcolm Knox's excellent article on the book and film in last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald Spectrum liftout.  Dig it out and have a read, it is quite interesting.Anyway, as I said, the book looks like it might be a pre-requisite for not only viewing, but enjoying this rather black thriller/comedy.  It uses the old Kubrick standby of making lots of things very white and contrasted, the direct opposite to what is being portrayed in the film.So what do we have?  We have a yuppie, Patrick Bateman, going quietly mad with all the corporate life swimming around him.  And he just snaps and starts killing people.  Or does he?The beauty of this film is that the ambiguity over the deaths is left right until the end, to allow the viewer the chance to fully wallow in the murderous spree Bateman revels in, without the distraction of thinking ""now did that happen or not?"".To give him his worth, Christian Bale is quite good as the killer; a well mannered, precise kind of 80's music loving guy who suddenly starts having a lot of bad days.He typifies in all of us perhaps what we would like to do in real life.  Who can honestly say that at some point in their lives they haven't wanted to kill a work colleague?  Without getting too much into Monty Python territory here I will leave it at that.As I said, I truly believe an appreciation of the book is important to the enjoyment of this film, even if you just read some well researched reviews of it first.  Check out the SMH one, it is great!6 out of 10.",American Psycho

I admit I haven't read the novel for which this is film is based upon, but if this is any guide I don't think I am missing anything by giving it a pass.Outside the pretentious 80's dining experiences that did give me a chuckle or too - I think I am being generous when I give it a 4 out of 10. A four because the production values were adequate, the set design was pretty good, and the costumes fit the mood and period quite well.

Christian Bale gives an outstanding performance as the avatar of '80's materialism, Patrick Bateman, a yuppie who is cold and completely indifferent to his environment, not to mention totally insane and homicidal.  American Psycho takes the viewer on a daring journey into the darkest reaches of the human mind, and although noticeably flawed, it comes out as a thoroughly entertaining and thought-provoking study of man's dark desires.",American Psycho
389,krisrox,Superb adaptation of modern classic,10,16 February 2013,"I've read ""American Psycho"" by Bret Easton Ellis three times, and consider it a modern classic. It's both a brilliant satire and a psychological thriller with David Lynchian ambiguous elements thrown in, and as such, it seemed destined to be butchered by Hollywood: satire and ambiguity don't sell, while the superficial elements that the book so hilariously portrays - gore and luxury - do.Lucky for us, the adaptation was passed around by the big players, dropped a few times and finally scooped up by the semi-obscure Canadian director Mary Herron. Left with a relatively small budget, she decided to build her movie around Christian Bale, who - believe it or not - was also very much a struggling B- or C-lister in 1999.In my opinion, it couldn't have worked out better. Free from the pressures of a big budget, Herron expertly translates the essence of the novel to the big screen without resorting to unwarranted commercial stylings. She allows the movie to define a genre of its own: ""American Psycho"" is equal parts black comedy, 80s homage, slasher movie, and thriller, brought to us by its very unreliable narrator, the infamous Patrick Bateman.Which brings me to Christian Bale. I am by no means a member of the Christian Bale fan club, but his work here is fantastic and I cannot imagine another actor nailing Bateman this perfectly. No hyperbole needed: this is one of my 10 favorite movies of all time, with one of my 5 favorite lead actor performances of all time.",American Psycho

392,ftm68_99,Uneven.,6,26 June 2016,"I think the main issue I had was that most of the actors seem to have been directed to talk in a flat, monotone-like voice. I'm guessing this was done in order to make the characters show that they are cool and sophisticated...or at least to make other characters *think* they are such. Thing is, when you have to hear movie characters talking this way for most of a movie's running time, it becomes boring itself after a while. Or so I found.Then there were at least two contradictory moments. The main character is supposed to be a hygiene freak, yet he seems to have no problem 1: having sex in his work clothes; then 2: hitching up his pants up without showing the slightest interest in cleaning his private parts. Really? Later on, after having made it clear what a clean freak he is, he flicks a cigarette ash on the floor of his office. Really??These may seem like trivial moments to some, but I found them distracting.What did I like about the movie? Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon and Willem Dafoe. They were the only actors/characters who seemed to act like real people.So, I give it a 6 out of 10.

I quickly realized this movie was not any sort of commentary about mental health and/or one's decent to such a level that Patrick Bateman is. It is more of a focused character study of a serial killer.The movie puts you right in the shoes of this man (played very well by Christian Bale) and bluntly lays out his attitude and desires from the start. His very unsettling behavior contrasted with his wealthy lifestyle make for some great scenes, such as the ""morning routine"".All of this plays in to an interesting look at wealthy American culture as a whole. Of course not all rich people are horrible, but the fact that his co-workers/peers are too concerned with themselves and their life to take notice of some of the strange things he does says something about these environments, albiet not something profound or moving in my opinion.***SPOLIER SECTION (And my main complaint with the movie)****
I decided I need to talk about the ending for this to be a complete review. Everyone has a right to be confused with it. While some seem to think it's brilliant, I don't completely agree.It portrays very very ambiguously that perhaps some of, most of, or possibly all of these murders and atrocities he was comminting were imaginary or exaggerated in his mind. It's very unclear. There was some moments eluding to this idea. There are several points in the movie where he does or says something very odd. It's not enough to throw off the other characters, but it is enough for the audience will question what they just saw was for real. Of course things in that ending sequence were definitely imagined, and that leaves the audience to question if other things were too.My problem is that it was too ambiguous. If he really is just imaging these things in his head, that hurts the impact of these horrible murders we just witnessed, and therefore the entire movie. I like how he appeared to fear being caught. I liked how it seemed that he maybe wants to confess deep down. But I can't determine for sure if those things were real either. Patrick Bateman is the only perspective you have in this movie, which is overall a good direction choice. But here, it leaves too many question marks for me to say it leaves a significant lasting impression.That said, I completely respect ones opinion that the ending adds to the rest of the movie. Even with that, I'm still giving it a 7/10, which is above average on my scale.",American Psycho
394,fidelio74,To film the unfilmable,8,27 October 2010,"We had to wait nine long years but it finally happened; 'American Psycho' was filmed! And what's more, director Mary Harron did a fantastic job. Bret Easton Ellis' novel created a massive controversy upon its release in 1991, the book's graphic sex and violence offending many readers. There were calls for the novel to be banned, which in turn created a very interesting debate about free speech. The book is a modern classic; not as good as Ellis' masterpiece, 'Glamorama', but stunning nonetheless.Christian Bale stars as the psychotic, fashion- and music-obsessed Wall Street broker Patrick Bateman who has everything: good looks, a great body, a beautiful girlfriend, a high-paying job, and a spectacular Central Park West apartment. But appearances can be deceiving, and just beneath Bateman's saturnine surface simmers a rage and madness which is spiralling out of control.The film looks fantastic, full of chic fashions and beautiful people. And it sounds great too, with a splendid soundtrack featuring David Bowie ('Something in the Air'), Huey Lewis and the News ('Hip to be Square'), New Order ('True Faith'), and others. 'Something in the Air' plays over the initial end credits; the same song plays over the initial end credits of Christoper Nolan's mind-bending 'Memento'.The sequel, 'American Psycho 2: All-American Girl' is what you would expect from a direct-to-DVD release: utter dreck. William Shatner puts in an appearance, and his presence is always most welcome.I do hope 'Glamorama' ('Specks!') is filmed because it would make a great movie. I recently read 'Imperial Bedrooms' which is a sequel to 'Less Than Zero', and quite enjoyed it. Ellis is a massive talent and I look forward to the film adaptation of his 'Lunar Park'.Much of the sex and violence in the novel 'American Psycho' does not make it into the film. Harron has used a very classy and restrained approach, although the movie does still have its nasty moments. I hope she makes more films because she is clearly a very talented director and someone to watch.",American Psycho

Although it would be nice to spoon feed all the answers, it would leave very little to the imagination.
The film makes a good crossover from the book and violence wise the book is much more severe. We do not see cannibilism and any of the wierd sexual acts that Patrick Bateman performs in the book.

In 2000, Mary Harron released ""American Psycho"", her most accomplished movie. The whole movie has a clear crisp '80s look, and a new sheen of social satire, which really gives the movie a big boost. In terms of writing craftsmanship, the sheer scriptwriting, this movie hits a new peak of professionalism. The movie is so catchy, most people don't even try to understand the meaning, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, importance of trends, hollow yuppie lifestyle and murders, but it's also a personal statement of a director herself!Do you like Christian Bale?I've been a big Bale fan since the release of his '94 movie ""Prince of Jutland"". Before that, I really didn't understand any of his work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on ""Prince of Jutland"" where Christian Bale's presence became more apparent. I think ""American Psycho"" is Bale's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding movies. His acting is as positive and affirmative as anything I've seen in any movie. The brilliant ensemble of other actors makes ""American Psycho"" great,great movie, a personal favourite. You can practically sense the empathy between Bale, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon and Samantha Mathis.So, to sum up, the movie is extremely uplifting, it shines with hope that it's not too late to better ourselves, and contains a crucial message - since it's impossible in this world we live in, to empathise with others, we always empathise with ourselves.

Christian Bale is excellent in his role and it is good to see, that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't play Bateman, I think he would not have been good in this movie. Bale really shows how artificial his life is. All the preparations for his skin and so on. I also thought that American Psycho also makes fun of yuppies of the 80's.

402,morphion2,Not To Be Judged By Its Cover,9,25 January 2006,"Before acclaimed author Brett Easton Ellis had even published ""American Psycho"" in 1992, the novel had generated great controversy, receiving heated protest from women's groups and death threats against Ellis. It's no surprise, then, that it was adapted to film less than ten years later, complete with rather graphic allusions to all sorts of sordid acts. What may come as a surprise, however, is that it also bore an edgy sense of intelligence, one that would perhaps further horrify some viewers, but nonetheless prove provocative.Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is, in many respects, the perfect American man. He is 27 years old, in fabulous physical shape, he is handsome and intellectual and successful; he shares a Vice Presidency at a very important business on Wall Street. He has a fiancé, is well respected and well off. His only flaw, aside from a conditioned obsession with self-image, is that for reasons decidedly undefined, he is absolutely, irreparably, violently insane. Said insanity becomes increasingly evident over the course of the film, illustrated by Bateman's frequent surreal sex romps and horrific butcherings, for which he feels next to no remorse.The film's deceptively simplistic title and premise perhaps deliberately sell it short as a senseless gore-fest. ""American Psycho"" is, quite simply, more than that. It is a challenge, a threat, a spit in the face of a society that promotes anti-individualism and bland conformity in the egotistical pursuit of a presupposed perfect existence, while accommodating brutal acts and sick attitudes of all kinds. Sure it's disturbing, sure it's offensive, but it's also the best dark satire of American culture since ""Fight Club"", and it is damn proud of it.For this, we have two very important people to thank. The first is director Mary Harron, whose perceptive vision saw this project from potential catastrophe to a level for more intelligent and meaningful. Harron's take on the twisted story is considered and appropriate, delighting in subtle mockery but carrying a more serious agenda as well. She expertly intersperses horror and comedy, while managing to steer clear of anything gratuitous or cheap.The second hero of the piece is star Christian Bale. With expressed interest in the lead part from the likes of Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio, some might have considered sticking with the lesser known Bale as a risk. They may have been right, but one thing's for sure; he was the perfect man for the job. He is sensational, superb, sublime and any other alliterate praise there is. His perfect rendering of a character forced to fake almost every facet of humanity, an effectual vacuum of emotion is by and large the most intriguing thing about the film. His uncanny ability to make the horrific humorous cements the viewers' interest in what might otherwise repel them; a terrific performance from Bale that illustrates a talent only hinted at in some of his later, more mainstream work like ""Batman Begins"".For those who prefer their laughs guiltless, or their interest not bordering quite so much on disgust, then perhaps ""American Psycho"" is not for you. It's no secret that depictions of brutal violence and sickening themes don't hit the top at the box office. But an open mind goes a long way in the world of film, and it is controversial pictures like this one that continue to remind us why.",American Psycho

It isn't some mesmerizing ordeal that you have to watch again, because let's be honest we should never want anyone to watch it once let alone twice! It makes zero sense, and is like a torture porn on crack. Speaking of wisecracks, yeah is sneer gets really old. This guy is beyone cold. It influences negative emotions to even watch the smut. I think they should make the writers family watch it. Then see how he feels. This is the difference and time about when cinema started to go downhill for me. I do really like Christian Bale and think he is very talented. I like him in The Machinest and Harsh Times. Those make this even worse than it is, but I don't know if that's possible. I also saw Christian Bale makeout with a dude before accepting an award, with his wife present. Oh yeah a guy I want to be like. Lol. I wouldn't for the world. Let's face it in the land of Hollyweird most of them are bad actors or bad people or weak minded or just sellouts. Why don't I ever see Denzel in any garbage like this? Oh yeah because He probably would tell you to take a hike. They should of left it to Duh-Chrapio maybe then it wouldn't of gained so much popularity over nothing.

Also let's be honest doesn't look like an 80's set when in 1999-2000 Ontario does it? This movie is more than smut. It is more than vile. This is what is wrong with our youth, viewers, society. We buy this garbage and pass it off as entertainment? What is entertaining here? Watching him sing Phil Collins as he does some hacking with fake blood? I halfway liked the businessman card scene, but not enough to like the movie as a whole. It is just a way to make the males like chauvinistic pigs especially the New York Stock Brokers of the 80's. Yet to take to this extent? He is one sick yuppie puppy, but then again isn't the director? I guess Bale is the one laughing his way to the bank. Career breakthrough was it worth it? He probably thinks so.",American Psycho
404,barfly99,Hilariously vicious satire of the 1980s.,9,15 May 2000,"So let's get this straight: AMERICAN PSYCHO is pornographic and horrific, but also not shocking enough; it's dull and boring, but also overly brutal and disgusting; it crams in too much of the novel, but also not enough. Films like this just can't win when so many people insist on going to see it with such deeply entrenched expectations of exactly what kind of film it ought to be, rather than judging it on its own terms. Surely it is beyond serious dispute that Christian Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman is as compelling as you could possibly hope to see. And some moments (notably the business card scene and Patrick's meditations on various MOR musicians) are extremely funny. I can understand the gore putting off some people, but it's actually no more gory than, say, GOODFELLAS, and nobody ever seems to imply Scorsese ruined that film with graphic violence. And I find it astounding that a film that gets its point across so determinedly can be labeled ""pointless"". The portrayal of a decade of image without substance, riches without work, sex without love, and so on, represents, I would have thought, a pretty forthright ""point"", whether you agree with it or not. The film's closing monologue is merely a final reminder that sincerity has no place in a world so vacuous and empty. For me one of the funniest and most telling moments in AMERICAN PSYCHO is when Willem Dafoe, who had previously appeared to be the typically astute screen detective, turns out to be just another grinning Huey Lewis fan - perhaps with dark thoughts and urges of his own. I for one will certainly be extra careful with the next person I hear raving about Phil Collins.",American Psycho

That was my own stupidity for thinking that because something is controversial,that it's good.I started out thinking the show was half decent,only for the plotline to be total go-nowhere-garbage. The acting was sub-par with very paper characters. I hated this movie so much and was so disgusted by the actors in it that it's unlikely that I'd ever sit through a movie with any of them in it again due to loss of respect for them.",American Psycho
406,monty_lnct,American Psycho failed to be a satire and succeeded in entertain us but this movie left me with a question of how much Patrick batman i have inside me?,7,2 June 2010,"American psycho is wickedly funny,thrilling and hilariously shocking movie which doesn't prove or point anything substantial or thought provoking but still entertain you,one of the most controversial movie based on equally controversial novel with the same name.We all have a evil part of us,a beast inside.Now,it depends upon us how much of it we have.The measure of our success as a human or as asociety can be measured by how we control it.Either we unleash it or we can try to suppress it.this story is about a bank executive who has an alter personality of Patrick batman by which he fantasizes himself being a serial killer.it is very clearly shown in the movie that heis frustrated with the society and the peoples with he live but the reasons for him being so frustrated and annoyed doesn't seemed to be reasonable to me. Yes, he was very highly obsessed with perfection and wanted everything according to him.This is why,he get angry easily but i can say that the feelings aroused in him was innate or inborn in him and it was just his state of mind which make him crazy for blood and violence.So what was the idea behind the movie?what movie tried to show us? in fact the movie was intended to be a satire about rising frustration and anger among peoples against materialistic society, against the profit oriented ,consumerist world which is full of careerists, hypocrites and liars.but movie failed to made any point because script fall flatly to bring the message in front of us.the result we obtained was of A-grade slasher movie full of comedy and violence,have brilliant performance from Christian bale and a overall good direction from Mary Harron.the only drawback of this movie is its script.the movie obviously is entertaining.It is funny at one moment and suddenly movie will horrify you and have very witty dialogues.but the movie did not provide completely what you wanted from it and that is the message.they did not provide any valid justification for his actions which makes us dis- connected and distant to the character of Patrick.we felt entertained but untouched.both a clockwork orange and fight club clearly gave reason for anti-hero being highly disturbed and his inclination towards violence but this movie fail short of it. also,the ending was satisfying and disappointing both.we can have our own opinion on that if he really killed them or not,but i think it was only his imagination.it was relieving for me to know that he was not a serial killer but it was also clear that at the end he was not at the better condition too.As he said he is in a constant pain and wanted his pain to be inflicted on other i felt sad for him by realising that the rage and anger inside him will become more and more and it is possible that he will kill someone one day.Overall the movie was very well directed by Mary Harron.It was really surprising for me that a woman directed such a bold and unusual movie. She handled the project cleverly and provided us the feel we never had from watching from any other movie.everything was perfect-the atmosphere ,the pace,the performances form every single cast, the soundtrack, everything was at the right place.unfortunately she did not get the good support of script, otherwise movie should have been perfect.But the real highlight of the movie was thundering performance of Christian Bale.i always thought of bale as mediocre actor who cannot bring challenging performances but he proved me wrong.he totally got inside the personality of Patrick batman,his body-language,dialogue delivery ,expressions were mind-blowing.He forced me to laugh at the moments where i should feel disgust.His highly unstable and eccentric portrayal of unsympathetic anti-hero is the performance worthy to be praise and remembered.",American Psycho
407,pax03,great performance by Bale,8,15 November 2005,"When i first saw this movie, i didn't know what to expect, and after viewing it, i was confused and didn't know what to think. Was it a slasher movie? was a comedy? was it a horror movie? what did i just see. I read up on it some and found out that it was mostly a satire about the economic boom of the 80s rightly called ""reagan-economics"" and what one man goes through when he really can do anything he wants because he is so powerful and rich. It goes into things like respect of women and how men in the 80s cared more about what they wore, the way they looked and the music they listened to more than ever. Batemans rant about Phil Collins and his music right before he doubled up on a pair of hookers should go down in cinema history. Christian Bale gives a stellar performance here. Every time i see him in a movie now days, i just think back to American Psycho as his really star making performance. If you want to see someone put on an acting clinic, check out his performance. Fans of the book, should be happy, i haven't read it but i hear from people that have, say it is more like the book than not like other movies that are based on books. If you are a Bale fan you will be greatly pleased as this is the movie that he will probably be remembered for, also Batman Begins, but thats another story.",American Psycho
408,Marthian80,Good movie about a man who blurs between reality and fantasy,7,14 July 2017,"American Psycho's story is about a young banker named Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) who at age 27 has it all: a high position in his dad's company, a very expensive apartment in the heart of New York City, he's very handsome, is engaged to a beautiful woman (with a few girls on the side..) and he likes to kill random people because he likes it... Yes our Patrick is actually very unhappy about his life and claims he doesn't feel empathy or love at all. He's so out of touch with humanity that several people mistake him for someone else, even people he knows for years. His only escape out of his life of wealth and power are his fantasies of sex and violence and acting out on it. But how long can he go on without people suspecting something? Or is everyone so busy with boosting their own ego's that they fail to notice that there is a psycho in their midst? This movie does a good job in displaying how a mind as twisted as Patrick Bateman works and how he is on a downward spiral as the lines between his violent dreams and reality get more and more blurry. I was impressed with Bale's performance, especially the scene where he breaks down and calls his lawyer and when he is going full blown crazy running around with a chainsaw. The rest of the cast also does a fine job in portraying the rich snobs and dumb girls that circle around Bateman. The only voice of reason and the only person who shows empathy is Bateman's secretary (excellent performance by Chloe Sevigny), I really liked her role in the movie. The movie started a bit slow though, the first 45 minutes could be chopped in half because some parts don't add much and are a bit dragged out. It also didn't feel like the 1980's, I was often wondering what the time period was supposed to be, despite the excellent 80's soundtrack. And I couldn't help but compare this movie with another story about a psychopath: Clockwork Orange, one of my favorite movies of all time. But I guess it takes a movie maker like Kubrick to really show how the mind of a psycho works. But like clockwork orange, this movie ending get's you thinking. It leaves it up to the viewer how to interpret-ate the events that happened.So all in all a good movie with a great performance of Christian Bale. Definitely check it out if you like movies about crazy people and don't mind a few violent/sexual scenes.",American Psycho

412,Rimmer-10,Christian Bale lacks something,4,23 July 2001,"************ SPOILERS ******************** My mistake was that I've read the book before I saw the movie - big mistake. My image of Pat Bateman was a hyper violent nutcase in perfect disguise - controlling and manipulating his environment in his ""normal"" life and murdering and torturing at nighttime. But the insanity should be visible throughout - in every move he makes.The movie and Christian Bale *tries* to make that image, but they just don't make it - Bale is not able to balance on the edge between insanity and normal - he does not convince me at all. And that is a major flaw since the entire movie is based upon this image.I don't want to see the gore, the blood or the rat thing - it would have made me really sick (I almost vomitted when I read the book) - that is not what I'm lacking in this movie. I want Christian Bale to convince me as Pat Bateman - that's not easy I know - I guess only two or three actors could have pulled it off and Christian Bale is not among those. Sorry to say it but it really ruins the movie.The ending of the movie is strange but it really just follows the book. I believe it wants us to ask this question: ""was all this just a dream in Pat Batemans sick mind - that he in need for some action just invented the whole thing ... or has the society just accepted that these brutal murders are OK - a sort of apathy as seen in Se7en?"".The book: 8 of 10, the movie: 4 of 10.",American Psycho
413,negeati,"unusually fascinating, yet unworthy of the hype",8,18 April 2000,"""American Psycho"" is a ...good horror movie. But it is not worthy of the hype it got at Sundance. I guess I should be thankful to Lions Gate for releasing the movie uncut in Canada (with an R rating nonetheless). The 'offensive' scene is very graphical, yet it shows even more how much did Bateman love himself. Christian Bale is stunning as Patrick Bateman, a personality-free and moral-free killer. The man is completely incapable of feeling pleasure, unless he kills someone or he embellishes himself even more. He washes himself extremely thoroughly, not because he is a clean freak, but because it takes time to wash different parts of the body with different kinds of soaps. He uses more lotion cream than a woman, just to have a nice skin. Porn movies have absolutely no effect on him, yet he watches them like someone would watch a regular movie. There is a very funny scene when he talks on the phone with his lover (not girlfriend), and in the background a porn movie is playing on TV, he doesn't even look at it. While having sex with two women, he watches himself on TV (he was videotaping himself) and in the mirror. He is so self absorbed that he doesn't let anyone touch him, unless he wants to. I love the scene when he starts to hate Paul (Jared Leto). His face turns so ugly that he becomes frightening.The film has some genuinely hysterically funny moments. After becoming jealous on one of firm's partners, he decides to kill him. He goes to the restroom, and gets ready to strangle the guy, but he doesn't get the chance to do it. The 'victim' who was gay and had the hots for Bateman, thinks that his passes are being answered and takes Bateman's hand and kisses it. He is so shocked that he can't find the exit faster. I roared with laughter. Now there was a first. Being gay actually saved the partner's life.
Another character that I cared about was Jean, his secretary. Chloe Sevigny is wonderful in a small role and I felt happy that Bateman didn't kill her.
The script is very well written. I have never read the book, and I have no intention to do so, yet I am very satisfied with the script. The interesting part it is that it is written by two women, capturing a huge amount of the novel's misogyny. The movie isn't however perfect. The ending is unsatisfactory yet interesting. It is also confusing. Yet the movie is brilliant, and it is a pity that it will never be a box-office hit. 8/10.",American Psycho

The fact that it is a satire should be remembered when watching in order to understand the movie right. Characters are interesting and simply great, because of their superficial lifestyles and the way those have been represented.

416,alishahmohd,Violence for the sake of violence,4,20 November 2013,"American Psycho is highly regarded on IMDb, many have listed it in their favorite movies lists, this movie is based on the book by the same name. But I just don't understand what's so good about it. American Psycho is basically a story about a man who goes on a rampage killing everyone for no apparent reason, apparently he is a sociopath, a psychopath, a man who has mood disorders or multiple personality disorder or something else which is never made clear. One time before killing he has a sudden change of heart and chooses not to kill. He just doesn't kill but completely mutilates the bodies of the victims and cuts them to pieces and displays them in his second house which he uses for most of killings.Now I enjoy stories about serial killers, and Bateman shares many of their antics and method of operations, which is a plus point for me, I have also read stories and articles about serial killers and investigations, and also watched movies like Silence of the Lambs and Se7en which were both fantastic mind you. But while those films were very violent they had a meaning behind the killings, in this films there is no excuse or reason for Bateman's actions other than he is mentally unstable. Perhaps some therapy sessions with a psychologist or psychiatrist could have been used to make all this seem clear and find out what is really in his head and what's going on in his mind. Many directors alter the stories in movies as compared to the book so why not? The main part which bothers me is the investigation part, Bateman kills so many people in the film but apparently the cops don't care about investigating the whereabouts, finding out what happened and find out who maybe involved, gather a list of suspects, perhaps try to find Bateman's house where many people went missing, other movies based on serial killers had this aspect but it is missing in American Psycho? It could have seriously made this film more fun to watch. Instead we have one detective who investigates the disappearance of Bateman's business rival but still finds nothing after his minor and very brief appearances.The cops in the climax come after Bateman in force and overpower forcing him to escape, take refuge and confess all killings to his lawyer, but the cops did not go after him because of all the murders but because he shot an old lady who saw him trying to kill a cat. Right!. Then we are left with a wonderful twist in the ending that the murders were all Bateman's imagination. Bateman's flat where he did the serial killing was empty up for sale and not even his, apparently he killed no one all this was in his head. Again the ""it was a dream"" concept used to get rid of the cop investigation aspect. The director of the film said that she did not want the people to think it was all Bateman's imagination, but honestly that is the only way to analyze the ending otherwise the ending makes no sense to me at all. No matter how you analyze the ending, dream or no dream the film's overall plot is boring and the ending is nothing we haven't seen before. One way or the other this movie will confuse the hell out of you to decide what is real and what is Bateman's imagination. Bateman's conversations with the investigator were they real? Was his assistant being in his flat real or not? Bateman attempting to attack that homosexual businessman in the toilet was that also real or all in his head? Seriously this movie messes with your head. Movies like the Usual Suspects and even Fight Club which follow a similar concept, made it all perfectly clear by the end.Other than Bateman's serial killing the movie is filled with a lot of boring dialogue which is too cliché and almost painful to sit through, that dialogue bores me out of my mind and is not even a contributing factor to any of his killings apart from one perhaps, when he kills a businessman. The Investigator and Bateman's conversations are also nothing special. Bateman also spills out random threats for no reason but the people pretend they did not hear him as if he did not say anything, which ends up looking stupid. Christian Bale's performance in the only saving grace of this film as he is really into the Bateman character and is given almost all the screen time, the other's are honestly nothing special and only there to fill a gap. Obviously if you enjoy tons of violence in films and the gore you will also find it as a high point, I don't, I am fine with violence but not only this is too much, there is no real meaning behind it all but the ending makes it all meaningless. I don't understand why this film is so highly regarded. Maybe the book makes things more clear and may make an interesting read but this film was a chore to watch in my opinion.Overall: 4/10",American Psycho

I've really come to appreciate the little details over the years and you know what, the biggest draw for me at this point is Matt Ross. What an actor.

418,newday98074,Black,7,19 December 2007,"AP is more ""black satire"" than ""black comedy"". It creates a Manhattan yuppie world where no one does any work therefore appearance is all, symbolized best in a competition for who has the best looking business card. However beneath one man's overlay is a Jack the Ripper character who kills and carves at will. The violence isn't as graphic as in some Peckinpah films but the lead actor does a fine job celebrating his character's bloody hidden personality. That inside killer blends with his ""real"" persona toward the end till reality and fantasy merge-or were they always merged? Apparently so, as the ending makes it clear the only crimes committed were in his mind, the ultimate satire of a society concerned only with appearances. I can't say I recommend the movie to everyone but it did keep my attention for the most part. There are some clunky moments, especially with the investigator, whose last conversation with the lead probably should have been placed closer to the end of the film. The final clue to the truth of his madness was given by someone who carried no threat, therefore the impact of the message softened. However all the actors did a fine job IMO, production values were fine, there were no clanging goofs, and that world was fun to look at.",American Psycho
419,ozymandiaskingofkings,Bale IS Bateman,8,1 July 2009,"I recently got this on DVD and felt that it was worth reviewing as, although I had seen the film before, it was a long time ago and I feel that I basically missed the point of the whole thing, concentrating on the serial killer aspect and not fully appreciating the more sophisticated vein of black comedy beneath it.Don't get me wrong, the film is gloriously bloody and violent, with several scenes of brutal and shocking murder, but in actuality this is a far more complex film, mixing elements of social satire, pitch black comedy and existential drama.Set in the latter years of the 80s, the film follows Patrick Bateman, a handsome, successful and intelligent 20 something, who is nevertheless a thoroughly unpleasant individual. Bateman is a yuppie who has pretty much everything that most people (not me, but as far as I'm aware the average person) aspire for: lots of money, a nice apartment and a beautiful, if a little dim, fiancé (played by the delightful Reese Witherspoon as charmingly stupid), yet he is ultimately a totally shallow, empty individual, with no real taste or passion, living an utterly unfulfilling life which he is only able to fill by committing horrendous murders. His only passions are incredibly inane, and though he offers opinions on politics, morality etc, he ultimately cares only about having the most stylish business card or eating at the best restaurant.What is fascinating about the film is that while Bateman is initially utterly unlikeable, coming across from the outset as narcissistic, shallow and hypocritical, he is no simple Gordon Gecko style monster and, strange as it seems, as Bateman goes off the rails and slides into homicidal insanity, he becomes more likable and more human, until we are almost on his side. Of course, crucial to the success of the film is that Bateman is a comic creation as well as a horrific one, often trying to confess his murders to those who don't listen (""I like to dissect girls, Do you know I'm utterly insane?"" he offers to one disinterested character) and giving lengthy monologues on 80s music shortly before committing his crimes.Of course, much of the praise for making Bateman such a fascinating figure should rest at the feet of Christian Bale, and despite a fantastic supporting cast, it is ultimately his film. Interestingly, his Bateman, a slick popular businessman who is all carefully constructed image, but in reality is violent and disturbed, seems to eerily predict his reading of Bruce Wayne in Chris Nolan's Batman films, though of course, Bateman channels his angst and wrath in much less healthy ways Visually, the film is extremely impressive, a world of clinical, immaculate apartments, affluent nightclubs and soulless offices presented in stunning blandness, while the murders are colourful and shockingly choreographed, often the only scenes of intrigue or vibrancy. The problem with this is that it leaves the film open to accusations of 'style over substance', and initially the film appears to mirror its protagonist; great to look at, and extremely cool, but ultimately soulless. However, this is all flipped in a final act which has us questioning all we have seen so far.Comparisons have been made with ""Fight Club"", but these are wide of the mark as it is neither as subversive, nor as effective as Fincher's movie. Bateman doesn't really change or learn anything as the film goes on and he film doesn't have the rich subtext of ""Fight Club"", often falling back on just laughing at the idiocy of yuppies. However, the emphasis on murder as something to bring emotion and meaning to life is fascinating, and in some ways echoes Camus' ""The Outsider"", and while not entirely successful or clear in its message, it is still a funny, shocking and intelligent film, anchored by an amazing central performance from Christian Bale.",American Psycho

But after reading a few explanation articles, it seems that the director herself admits that she didn't execute it well, and that Bateman actually did commit all those crimes. It's just the Wall Street elite lifestyle that saved his a**- the common mistaking identities problem, and of course the fact that no one wants to believe you're a murderer, cause of course that's not possible, right?I'm guessing the book is better than the movie, as they ALWAYS are, although I haven't read it as of yet.",American Psycho

424,res0owwh,"American Psycho (2000) is an enlightening film encompassing and requiring philosophy, esotericism, and quantum mechanics physics for complete understanding.",9,26 November 2001,"WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN.During the first 75% of this movie I found myself bored, irritated and judgmental toward the main character.  It was not until the last quarter of the movie when the interesting twists started occurring that it actually arrested my attention.The main character's, Patrick Bateman, behaviours would be classified by medical science as psychopathic and/or sociopathic in nature, or as being mentally insane.  Whereas, most psychopaths have or appear to have no conscience, Mr. Bateman did possess some conscientiousness, at least toward the latter part of the movie.Bateman experienced at least one consciousness dimensional shift as a result of the ""black hole"" effect he was experiencing in his consciousness/mind. That shift indicated by the facts that his attorney did not recognize him as Bateman but as Davis, the attorney's knowledge that Paul Allen was alive in his (the attorney's) reality, the apartment where Allen had resided and which was then under remodeling, the real estate representative's apparent knowledge of more than one existence/dimension evidenced by her statements to Bateman wherein she requested him to cause no trouble, to leave, and to not return.Mr. Bateman wanted, needed, and attempted to get help for his dilemma evidenced by his statement to his secretary on the telephone, ""I need help Jean, I don't think I'm going to make it"" to which she essentially ignored until later and his statement to his girlfriend, ""I need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale.  It cannot be corrected but I have no other way to fulfill my needs"", to which she also ignored as well as ignoring the drawing he was making at the dining table in the restaurant. The poor fellow was surrounded by egomaniacs who were totally engrossed in themselves only.Patrick Bateman's statements at the very ending of the movie illustrate his confusion, frustration, and lack of knowledge concerning the reality(ies) he found himself in.This is a movie which deals with immortality, infinity, free will, and a host of other esoteric-related philosophies, as well as some quantum mechanics physics' theories.Under the circumstances, it was impossible for me to not feel human compassion for this gentleman who found himself in a loop in hell with no obvious way out, to his present knowledge.",American Psycho

426,iF....,Might Seem Repulsive but its a Good Intelligent Film,9,16 April 2000,"I was waiting for the release of American Psycho when I first saw the trailer, back when I went to see Dogma in 1999. I'm a serious movie buff and when a film looks interesting; I go absolutely insane and desperate waiting for the film to come out. As time went by I started to see comments about people who saw screening at Sundance and so forth. Some comments were positive, some very negative. Nevertheless the good overcame the negative comments. So the film is finally released and of course I'm anxious to see it. I go to the theater but it's sold out. So the next day I go to the theater and I'm in! As I saw the films I am overwhelmed by the beautiful imagery, style, characters, and so forth. Overall, I was very satisfied. My only complaint was the ending.The idea of a man killing women in order to maintain a sense of sanity does sound a bit repulsive. Of course feminist groups will protest against this movie but there is a lot of missing information. The character Patrick Bateman doesn't only kill women; he kills men as well. He uses women as meat for sexual pleasures. Once he's done using them he eventually kills them. As for the men, he simply kills them out of jealousy. One thing about Patrick Bateman is that he hates people being more successful than him. So he strives to be superior to everyone. How so? By killing people. Even though some killings of his are rather illogical, some actually do make some serious points. His monologues before he kills his victims will help you decide whether or not his killings carry any sense of logic in them. Still, everything Bateman does has certain intelligence to it.
The ending was a bit of a let down. It seems that recent films tend to strive for the psychological ending, which I love. Fight Club had it; Stir of Echoes had it, the Sixth Sense, and now American Psycho. But American Psycho's lacked something. I am still not sure I understand the ending yet. I could have been that Bateman was actually insane and had to kill everyone to be at ease, or if his killings were all a state of mind- meaning he imagined and believed in them so much he thought they were real. Something that might have improved the film is if we could have seen what Bateman's secretary does after she sees his daily planner. Chris Bale has simply come a long way from being the kid in Empire from the Sun. His role back then was Oscar worthy, and it's even more apparent that he deserves recognition for his role as an insane-psychopathic Yuppie from the 80s. Overall the film is simply brilliant. It is a smart film and it is extremely well made. I'm just happy to see that an independent film such as this captivated the interest of many Hollywood mainstreamers. If anything we need more independent movies to get a wider audience. So far this is the best film I've seen so far this year due to a flawless performance by Bale, and the help of great direction. Lets hope it gains the recognition it deserves.",American Psycho

428,rickytrapp,American Psycho: A Sharp Satire,10,4 January 2011,"I loved American Psycho. Simply putting it, it is one of the greatest comedies of all time. That is how I see it, anyway. American Psycho is a sharp satire of the 1980's and a damn good film.Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a yuppie 80's business executive with a cold blooded urge to kill for no reason. That's the plot in a nut shell, but the film is so complex, especially in it's portrayal of the main character.Patrick Bateman is brilliantly portrayed by Christian Bale, in a knock out performance. A true tour de force and he is probably the main reason to see this film.American Psycho is recommended for horror, black comedy or thought provoking film fans.***/****",American Psycho
429,reel_emotion,Those Blood-Stained '80s,8,26 June 2007,"Directed by Mary Harron (I Shot Andy Warhol, The Notorious Bettie Page) and based on Bret Easton Ellis' (Less than Zero, The Rules of Attraction) controversial novel, American Psycho follows the antics of stockbroker/serial killer, uber yuppie Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). When watching this movie, you must remove all serious films about serial killers from your mind because American Psycho is a parody of horror movies and a satire about the materialism and shallowness of America during the 1980s. If you can view this as a very dark comedy, it works. Patrick Bateman is a blank slate of a human being who puts on the mask of being the modern male. He displays all the trappings of what constitutes the successful male in our society: lots of money, lots of women, lots of partying, and lots of toys (i.e., for the '80s, his Walkman, CDs, and, of course, video tapes.) But all the successful male trappings are only Patrick's outfit he wears in society to fit in. The shiny superficiality is reflected in the immaculate white and stainless steel décor of his apartment. The only thing that that makes him human ultimately is his blood lust. When committing his horrendous acts, he breaks through the shiny exterior to the ""meat and bones"" of it all where the deeper meaning might liethat is why when Patrick murders Paul Allen, it so disturbingly satisfying and amusing. After Patrick is done hacking up fellow stockbroker/nemesis Paul Allen (Jared Leto) who keeps confusing him with another stockbroker, he turns, and one side of his face is covered with blood, and the other is not, so you finally see the two sides of Patricka human with some complexity. With all the mistaken identity in the movie among the stockbrokers in their accepted uniform of identical designer haircuts, glasses, suits , and not to mention business cards, Patrick commits suicide in a sense with Paul Allen--murdering himself, and all the artificiality of his lifestyle. As for the anti-feminist, misogynist criticism that both the book and film received, having Mary Harron as director does bring more of a female sensibility to American Psycho. I don't think a male director could have objectified Christian Bale's body as beautifully as Harron did, especially in the shower and chainsaw scenes. If you look at the female characters, they are quite lost, and that is a commentary on society. Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis), Patrick's mistress, is a high society girl whose only function in life is to take pharmaceutical drugs, and Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon), Patrick's fiancée, is a rich Daddy's girl whose only function in life is to shop. On the DVD there is a hilarious deleted scene in which Patrick and Evelyn are in bed, and Patrick strides on top of her, unzipping his pants, while Evelyn looks away at the TV and tries to watch the Home Shopping Network; then she looks up and deadpans, ""What you want me to do with that? Floss with it."" The most disturbing scenes to me are when Patrick kills the homeless man, the dog and Christie the street prostitute. The homeless man scene is pure camp as Patrick tells him that they have nothing in common. As for the stomping of the dog, it is all implied with sound effects. For a movie that is considered so violent, much of the violence is implied and left up to the mind of the viewers. The chainsaw scene is where the movie uses every cliché in the scary movie business: the madman chasing the woman in jeopardy and bloody corpses popping out of closets. As Patrick wields his chainsaw towards Christie, it becomes more phallicthe chainsaw, the nail gun are all just extensions of his penis, an ironic sign of both power and insecurity. As Christie runs down the stairs, from a top Patrick positions the chainsaws and flings it down the stairwell with perfect aim, piercing her body. After that Patrick becomes an unreliable narrator in the movie, and you wonder if this is real. For some reason, the image of Christie pierced with a chainsaw reminds me of the infamous Hustler cover of the woman being fed through the meat grindera much referred to image by outraged feminists. But as disturbing as both scenes are, both are crucial to the movie's point of being a dark comedy and parody. Christian Bale (Batman Begins, The Prestige, The New World) will always be remembered for his role of Patrick Bateman. He eats the camera herealthough not literally! Some have thought his acting to be exaggerated, but that is the point: Bale plays someone who must act through his life to achieve his goal of ""fitting in."" Bale's performance also gives a bit of humanity to Patrick, especially during the scene where Jean (Chloe Sevigny), his secretary, is at his apartment. Bale acts charming to Sevigny's obliviousness all the while he looks in his kitchen cabinets full of murdering tools. He aims a nail gun behind Sevigny unbeknownst to her. A comical misunderstanding happens between them as Jean thinks that ""getting hurt"" by Patrick would be by having an affair with him while he knows that it would be killing her. Sadness washes over Bale's face as he tells her that she better go, and, for a second, you see a real person. American Psycho will not be for everyone, and the ending is cryptic. It doesn't romanticize the '80s, but it captures some of the ugliness of it. The soundtrack is pure guilty pleasure with Katrina and the Waves,Simply Red, The Information Society, New Order, Phil Collins, and Huey Lewis and the News. Bateman spews out little interesting, if somewhat pathetic reviews of these musicians and songs to his victims beforehand. You'll never hear ""Hip to be Square"" or ""Sussudio"" in same way again after watching this movie.",American Psycho
430,beatnick49,"An ""undisputed masterpiece""",9,24 February 2003,"Warning may contain spoilersThis movie is (as Bateman said about Hip To Be Square by Huey Lewis and the News) an ""undisputed masterpiece"". Like Fight Club, it succeeds with wit, dark satire, and a great social comment, against superficiality, conformity, and consumer culture. Mary Harron directs an excellent film, and she and Guinevere Turner convert the book into a marvelous screenplay.This is a stunning and forthwright criticism on consumer culture, exposing it's mindlessness, ludicrousness, and rediculousness. The characters are immersed in a world of reservations, poular music, clothes fashion, affairs, and drugs. Countless restaurant and clothing brands are mentioned, with frequent appointments that must be met, Who has the best business card is a major obsession as are reservations.(Like they areb really that important) A good moment is when one of Bateman's friends who are among the people he competes with for the best business card, Van Patten, states that he is not really hungry but would like a reservation anyway. Chauvinism is also rampant, 20 years after the women's movement.The cast is also well picked, Christian Bale is excellent as the crack snorting chauvinist Patrick Bateman whose life seems perfect on the surface with the apartment, limo, job, fiance, and friends, however his life is, in reality dull; repetitious and surrounded by people he envies and dislikes (such as the upstart Paul Allen, and the annoying Luis Carrurthers). In fact his lifestyle robs him of his humanity and his life is mundane; so much so it drives him crazy and derives him of all intellect (apart from brand names, restaurants, and pop-music)and emotion apart from (as Bateman himself tells us) ""greed and disghust"", his mind is so empty, killing is all he can ""do"" to fulfill himself.As for the rest of the cast; Guinevere Turner is excellent as the model Elizabeth, Reese Witherspoon is excellent as the hopeful, and cheerful Evelyn Williams who is yet also a conformist like everyone else in the film, Chloe Sevigny is great as Jean, the innocent secretary and one of the victims of Bateman's chauvinism, and Willem Defoe was well picked as Detective Donald Kimball.In short a fantastic movie, worthy of an award (I hope it got one), I thouroughly reccomend it, but dn't expect anything light, it is gory and graphic. the best version is on DVD. Watch it.",American Psycho

432,spinin,Shower Work Kill Shower Work Kill,8,16 April 2000,"""American Psycho"" focuses on the excessiveness of the business lifestyle of the late 80s. It is an interesting exaggeration on several levels. Because it is such an over the top story, it is a good comedy and a good movie.Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a typical businessman on wall street. He is a rich yuppie stud with an apartment that looks more like an art work. His daily morning activities include lengthy showers and healthy work outs. Patrick uses at least four or five various soaps and lotions to keep his skin smooth and perfect. His main area of focus is his handsome face. Patrick is also very fit since he tells us that he is able to do 1000 crunches every day. He dresses in fancy suits and goes to work, where we hardly see him do anything different than watch TV or listen to music. His favorite activity is going to expensive restaurants and having cynical conversations about business related topics. His friends are not much different looking than him. In fact, Patrick is mistaken for another man from his company on more than one occasion. This is no coincidence. The person continues to address him incorrectly, believing he is speaking to someone else. Patrick also has a girlfriend played by Reese Witherspoon. He hardly pays any attention to her. He prefers to listen to his walkman. Finally, whenever he finds the time, Patrick is a psychopathic serial killer.""American Psycho"" is very stylish and very well directed by Mary Harron. She creates simple and perfect surroundings appropriate for a man so concerned with his looks. Christian Bale plays the obsessive businessman very well. He gives the film the additional mechanical feel. Everything he seems to say is such a package. Nothing seems human, but rather an excessive and unnatural pose. He talks like an ad for restaurants and like a review of his favorite albums. Nothing seems to separate him from his friends, except for his dark secret. He takes pleasure in killing. And this seems very mechanical as well. Why does he do it? Why does he do anything?There are some great scenes in ""American Psycho."" One of them is the shower scene described above. Another excellent scene takes place in an office where Patrick and his friends are comparing business cards. They all carry them around in special metal cases as if they were worth a fortune. As they show them to each other, the cards seem exactly the same. Yet this is a tense scene. The subtle differences (the color of one card is described as ""egg shell"") create competition. Patrick shows signs of his paranoia as he realizes that his card is not the best one. There is also another good appearance by Jared Leto, who essentially serves the same purpose here as he did in ""Fight Club."" In my opinion, he is perfect for the role.And so, Patrick Bateman kills people. It has been criticized that the movie is pointless and there is no motive for all the murders. It doesn't matter. ""American Psycho"" is a SATIRE. The murders are funny, not always, but often. Patrick bateman is confused himself. He is having an identity crisis. This is the only thing that separates him from anyone else. The murders are an exaggeration just like the rest of his life.""American Psycho"" is a good film that lags at certain times. However, Chirtian Bale gives a great performance in a movie that is very attractive in its mechanical nature. It is such an exaggeration that it cannot be taken seriously like other serial killer movies. This is a comedy that looks good and works well. Overall, an 8 out of 10.",American Psycho

437,sean_36,disappointing,5,10 December 2001,"British actor Christian Bale stars in the role (that Leonardo Dicaprio turned down) of Patrick Batemen, a wall street hot shot who has a nasty habit of killing people, and for no good reason. Based on the conraversal book by Bret Easton Ellis the film was adapted by director Mary Haron who went though lots of difficulties to get this film made.  So was it worth it ?  Not really.  I'm not saying American psycho's a bad movie, but it's not a good one either.  It's more like in the middle. Among problems are the casting, although Bale looks like a psycho he goes over the top with the acting.  I would never believe him as a real person never mind a complex killer, which brings me to the second problem.  He wasn't complex enough! If you compare him with other crazies like Jack Nicholson in The Shining or Malcom McDowell in A Clockwork Orange you could see what they were going through which made it frightening because they seemed so real and believable.  Then there's the other problem of the pointless subplot with Willam Dafoe as a investigator, which didn't seem to go anywhere.  It has it's creepy moments though, like in a scene where Batemen works out while listening to the Texas Chainsaw Massacar or when he chases a women through an apartment wearing nothing but a chainsaw.  Maybe the film would have been better if it focused more on his mind and less on his crimes.",American Psycho
438,Freedomisanillusion,An absurd movie....although I liked it a lot,7,18 September 2005,"Having seen and read the Rules of Attraction, I investigated Bret Easton Ellis a little further and found out that he wrote American Psycho (I was aware of the book's existence and also the film's, but I was unaware that he had written the piece) and I decided to see it for myself.I have not read the book, so I may have missed something vital, but I certainly enjoyed what I saw.Christian Bale is excellent. Indeed, he saves the movie; everyone else is decent, but play like back-up singers to Chirstian Bale's main show. The way he portrayed Patrick in such subtleties and quiet complexities perfectly compliments the character, and he certainly seems to have enjoyed playing the part.American Psycho is actually a much more worthwhile film than the cheap trailer would have one suspect: the trailer plays as a cheap slasher flick, whereas the violence is almost second party to the satire of the 80's and yuppie way of life. Particulalrly memorable in my mind is the scene where Patrick is in the men's room and manages to goad the man in the next stall enough to stick his head over and demand ""Do you mind?! I am trying to drugs here!"" such is the chagrin of his disturbance.The film is also vaguely comical (not least of all in the scene where Patrick entertains Paul in his apartment. All together now: ""Hey Paul! AHHHHHHHH!"") and is just light enough to keep the violence in equal balance.Without this vaguely comical tone, which in turn adds the absurdity I spoke of, the violence would be exploitative. However, some of the film is quite disturbing, and I'd recommend that all conservatives stay clear of this.However, certainly see it for Christian Bale's brilliant performance.Avoid the incredibly lackluster sequel.7/10",American Psycho
439,Was-it-All-a-Dream,American Psycho (2000),7,3 May 2009,"I don't know if you've noticed, but serial killer movies in the horror genre have grown stale. Since 1986's very good Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, they've been cheap and too easy to produce. So, literally, just about everyone looking to make a name for themselves has made some kind of serial killer movie. The success of 2002's direct-to-video masterpiece Dahmer even started a series (Gacy, Bundy, Ed Gein). Also, multiple films based on the Zodiac killer, dozens of home invasion themed films, hundreds of ""based on a true story"" clones, and even parodies such as 2006's Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon. It's out of control. Reality in horror has never been more popular. Yet, the reality of these serial killer films is no more real than the masters of the sub-genre. Henry, for one. Also- 1991's The Silence of the Lambs, 1995's Se7en, 1973's Deranged, Wes Craven's immortal The Last House on the Left, and perhaps Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho. This genre screams, ""Been there. Done that."" A new film about a serial killer needs a fresh approach.Enter: American Psycho. This 2000 adaptation of the controversial Brett Easton Ellis novel took almost a decade to be made, but I think the film dares to go where almost no other killer film will- blaming its' killer on the culture of America itself. Being a rich, handsome, well-dressed bachelor in the New York business and club scenes of the mid-to-late 80's gives him a wealth of opportunities to meet women he would spend only a night with. Prostitutes, models, drug users, friends of friends. Patrick Bateman is one of the most sickening serial killer characters ever put on screen. He is a member of the sort of Wall Street Elite- a soulless, robotically judgmental bunch who go anywhere they want, do whatever they want, say whatever they want to - with no consequences. But even with this group, there is a chain of superiority. Built by acquiring certain status symbols. And with Patrick being toward the bottom of said chain, he's grown so needy of the status and yet, always receiving less of the validation that his fellow suits are pulling in. With that urge for utmost entitlement not satisfied, Patrick is becoming a blank rage.Now, that sounds rather cold and boring. It is, but it's also meant to be. The film captures the empty artificiality of Bateman and his type, which are hollow shells. Like an assembly line of pods which factory workers fill with raw material that are shaped by machines into products. Products that all look the same and are hard to tell apart. And that's the key to the film. Psycho is a world where the vultures (the ""werewolves of Wall Street,"" if you will) and their prey are equally hard to differentiate between. Patrick's victims are as faceless or nameless as he is (Patrick is all throughout the film mistaken for different people). And that's where the story gets interesting. Because, now the concept of things like alibis are irrelevant. Patrick lives in a who's-who society of people who are all on drugs or can't be bothered to pay attention to where they've been because their focus is on where they have to be next. It's almost a dark fantasy world, one where again, there are no consequences because there is zero sense of accountability. And in this world, that won't change. The system is too fed by the powers in charge of the nation. If one changes, the other has to change too. In a movie like this, ""change"" is nothing more than a lyric in a Michael Jackson song.The film remains purely fascinating. It's always updating itself with new information, and Patrick does undergo a crude character arc of sorts. I especially find it intriguing how his class of victims begins to change as the film progresses. Moving from prostitutes and homeless beggars to his rich friends and business associates. Even though he kills the man he sees who in his mind has it all, Paul Allen (played by 90's TV heartthrob, Jared Leto), no one notices that he's even missing. Patrick also assumes the identity of one of his other clones, no one notices. No one cares to notice. A fascinating turn of the knife from a similar set-up, for instance in 1999's The Talented Mr. Ripley- where, people actually do notice when the guy who has-it-all goes missing. The horror of American Psycho is the manner in which the film feeds Bateman his victims. Some of them have a human side, which is all we're given to relate to in the film. Otherwise, we're just sitting back and watching the horrors taking place on screen served up cold with no morality and no end in sight to the story.Lastly, the relevance of American Psycho today is how shockingly the film predicted a piece of history that was about to take place. How much the character portrayals of Bateman and his gang of clones have in common with former U.S. ""President"" George W. Bush and his administration of evil minions. Other than the obvious heartless and soulless quality to these people, was how much Bush was like a fictional character. And like Bateman himself. His father was a huge power icon (Bateman's father in Psycho owns the company everyone works at), he was a drone selected to do an important job and took advantage of the position for his own personal gains, he's handsome and was dressed well, says everything his cronies wanted to hear even when he was just spitting and not saying anything, and untold numbers of people died because of him. He was so pathetic in fact, he could've been Bateman's brother. That truly makes American Psycho a horror film unlike any other. One that retroactively has its' finger on the pulse of real life terror and tragedy. Oliver Stone's character study, W., was too little, too late.",American Psycho

There's a darkly sardonic feeling for the audience watching a world where even trying to get a table at Dorsia would result in gales of maniac laughter. Every character is self-absorbed and fails to read all of the others, from the kind Jean (played by Chloë Sevigny) who fails to realize Bale's Patrick Bateman is a literal serial killer to Dafoe's Donald Kimbell who seems to simultaneously understand and not know guilt. The film becomes a fever pitch nightmare where the ultimate actions of Bateman are unclear. I guess I don't mind personally adding my thought is that he did kill all of the people he said he did; I just think it makes a better story. Still, this confession means nothing.

If you liked ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" or ""Kiss of the Vampire"", you might find this movie tolerable, but don't go expecting to see a comedy of any sort. If anything, this film is a modern tragedy, along the same lines of the other two mentioned; we follow a protagonist's psychotic break, and witness how it goes unnoticed by the people around him.

443,grendel-37,A film that teeters between Miracles and Mania,9,13 October 2001,"Having just finished American Psycho, I came to IMDB to get some clarification on the ending. And it seems I'm not the only one left vaguely adrift by the ambiguous ending.I've browsed some of your comments, not all 400+ to be sure. But some of them. A good sampling I think, and this movie has three distinct cheering sections.Those who consider it a masterpiece, those who consider it unredeemable, boring trash, and by far the largest segment, those who see it as a flawed masterpiece.I fall into the latter category. And no, I did not read the book. But as others have stated any movie that requires you to read the book, to ""get"" the movie, is ultimately a failure as a movie.So my review is based solely on the merits of the film. And contrary to what some have said, the film does have many merits. I found it brilliantly directed, and a superbly acted examination of excess, and boredom, and evil. An examination, satire, critique of a time, and type of thinking.
Even before seeing the ending, I thought how much bateman lives in people. Found myself thinking, an examination of bateman is an examination of men by the name of Reagan and Bush. How American Psycho is an examination of our times, and our modern theologies.I found the movie as a whole riveting, loved the restraint shown (and disagree with those calling for more gore, I think Mary should be applauded for her deft hand, the scenes have more power for what is not shown), and was captivated by nearly every scene, by scenes others have called boring, but I found profound.Bateman putting on his makeup, or simply trying to get a restaurant, and the near apocalyptic importance, such minutiae makes in the lives of empty men. The right card, or the right cloth, or the right table, or the right watch, how these are the signposts of an empty age and an empty soul, and how these things have more value than your fellow man... or woman.Bateman attains everything the materialistic times tells him he should want, but once he gets it he feels nothing. Emptier than before, less than before. It's only in the extremes of his addictions he begins to feel something, anything. He feeds to fill the emptiness, but the more he feeds the emptier he gets. He eats at his fellowman (woman) but in his bloodlust he eats at himself.He is the American dream, taken to its cannibalistic extremes.And never before has makeup, played such a mesmerizing part in a movie. Bateman's(Chris Bale's) face at times when he is under stress, takes on a plastic look, a glossy, sweaty sheen, and for all the world it looks like he's wearing a mask... and the mask, his mask of sanity, is beginning to run.Simply amazing use of makeup. And incredible performance by the lead actor. I wasn't familiar with him before this, but everyone will be after this.Upon first hearing about this movie, I had no desire to see it. I've grown up since the age of Hills Have Eyes and trash like The Beyond, watching people suffer no longer seems significant. I guess as we get older we ask more of our art than springer, or the WWF, or slasher flicks. We ask of our art to tell us something true. Something of ourselves, and our world.I think American Psycho under the deft hand of Mary Harron becomes more than my prejudices, and exceeds my expectations. Rises at times to dizzying heights not unlike art.Mary's restraint makes this movie. But I fear her restraint nearly sinks it as well. The ending is too ambiguous. Who is Bateman in the end. Is there a Bateman? And what did he do or did not do?In the end,the movie will nag at you. Did he or didn't he? And in the end, now that I write this I'm thinking maybe the answer doesn't really matter, maybe in the end the answer is the same. In the end a sin of thought, or a sin of action, is still a sin. In the end we are left with a man, and a nation... whose mask is slipping.
I think like the first Psycho, time will prove this one.... worthy. I now add Mary Harron to the small selection of modern directors I will tiptoe through broken glass to see. Directors like Dave Fincher(Seven, Fight Club), Carl Franklin(Devil in a Blue Dress), Johnny To(Expect the Unexpected), Ringo Lam(Full Alert, Victim), M. Night Shyamalan(Sixth Sense, Unbreakable), and Peter Weir(Fearless).Recommended.",American Psycho

450,ebtsamryad,What a joke,1,7 September 2020,"Just when I thought I'm done seeing dumb movies .. this came along I came here immediately just after seeing the movie to express how much I hate this movie I hate it with passsion , never seen something so pointless stupid worthless meaningless like this movie , it's amazing how meaningless it is, It was really a waste of time , what an overrated movie , please don't watch it for ur own sanity I just think how could any actor accept working in this movie , then I think why wouldn't they , it's easy money , like Christian bale , who only had to walk with a stupid smile on his face , or just make straight face the
whole movie , I really finished the movie and I was thinking the whole time was this movie about . I kept a straight face the whole movie , I don't even know what's it's genre , were they trying to make it funny , cause i was definitely not laughing , and it's obviously not horror nor thriller . I literally wasted two hours of my life , I just wanna know were they battling of how much they could make it disgusting, I've never been so disgusted In my entire life till this movie came , the characters are waay unlikable and stupid , they had to put the most disgusting restaurants or nightclubs or whatever the that was . The plot was stupid , the acting was worse , everyone acted like an airhead dochbags and don't get me wrong . There's nothing wrong with bad personality but these characters were just bad bad . We never see what their background even is . It's just that we didn't care if any of the characters die and or whatever . This is the problem with this movie , we don't care about the characters , was that the plan ,I honestly don't get the high rating . I mean for what I just wanna sit with the people who gave this a high rating , and make them explain to me what the they liked about this movie , cause I honestly can't find one good thing about it , it's soooo freaking baddd . What a disappointment. And to think Christian bale and Reese whitherspoon Would actually be part of it . What were they thinking . I waited every 5 minutes to see something interesting or eye catching , but nothing . I have to say the director actually had a talent to make a whole movie about nothing , who could do that , I'm impressed . I can't believe I had to sit through all of this stupid movie to finally wasting my time . And to people who thinks this is a classic or the idiots who appreciate it just bcuz they think it's nostalgic and so . Can y'all open ur eyes and mind and please stop being so ignorant and actually differentiate between bad movies and actual good movies instead of worshiping every movie just because it's from the 90s . wake up",American Psycho
451,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,Mischief. Mayhem. Business Cards.,8,13 August 2001,"Every so often there is a film which is denied critical acclaim, simply because people keep comparing it to some superior flick. Take ExistenZ compared to The Matrix, for example. The Thing compared to Alien. Or The Game compared to Se7en. It's no accident I'm mentioning David Fincher's movies because I'm tempted to make one of those comparisons, this time with American Psycho and Fincher's Fight Club. And indeed, it's hard to gloss over the similarities, especially when you like Fight Club as much as I do. Both films parody consumerism, materialism and yuppies. Both films feature characters who engage in violent acts (although the reasons for this behaviour are far clearer in Fight Club). Also, the structure of both films share elements (third acts veering off in an alternate direction, etc.) and certain scenes in American Psycho recall distinct scenes in Fight Club (and A Clockwork Orange, for that matter).Compare both films and American Psycho loses out. There are numerous reasons. Most notably, American Psycho is relatively plot-free. We simply get a series of scenes of satire and ultraviolence, and some very, very basic storylines involving a murder investigation and Patrick Bateman's further descent into insanity. In Fight Club, the plot was one of its strongest points. Furthermore, American Psycho is a very cold film. It's main character is unlikable to the extreme so the coldness is actually a good idea in one way, but of course, it doesn't make for an emotionally absorbing experience (you could argue that this is as cerebral as Kubrick's famous satire). Fight Club did have a likable main character. It's determined focus on Bateman also makes it impossible for other characters (the women in particular) to make a lasting impression. Who can forget Marla Singer, on the other hand? Finally, American Psycho is so definitely eighties, it is at least as much a satire of the era as it is of its themes. In Fight Club, the themes are extended into today, and, for me, that makes it a more relevant film.But these points merely prove Fight Club is better, not that American Psycho is bad. Not at all, in fact. American Psycho wisely keeps it cool and detached and as a satire works tremendously well. There are a lot of stand-out scenes. The one that pops to mind right now is an incredibly funny sequence in which a couple of perfectly interchangable yuppies show off their new business cards. The scene then shows how Bateman becomes genuinely jealous of his fellow yuppies' better looking cards. These smart and very funny scenes bring across the absolute focus on one's own exterior. It also illustrates the perfect interchangability of its characters. In fact, mixing up people and not caring to know their names is part of the whole film's joke.Christian Bale is fantastic as narcissistic, egocentric and murderous Patrick Bateman and seems to get every scene just right. Indeed, his performance is probably what makes this film work. He plays Bateman not like a real person but like some kind of empty shell (the scene is which he recites the world's greatest plights is a great example), and also makes him perfectly aware and uncaring of his inner vacuousness. He is also as scary as any other movie psycho has ever been. His motivations are kept in the relative dark and the viewer is left to find those. To me, his behaviour is just another extension of his total uncaring, his complete inability to appreciate anything beyond the physical.The scariest thing about it? That everytime Bateman seems to be confronting his environment with his and its emptiness, he is met by unattentiveness or laughter. That's the point; Bateman's world is arguably as insane as he is. Now, just keep telling yourself, I am NOT a product of the eighties.

452,suicidalicecreamtruckdriver,"Violent, shocking: A truly terrifying depiction of the mental state.",10,29 April 2011,"American PSYCHO features Christian Bale playing Patrick Bateman, a rich man with a huge ego who is also a psychopath. Christian Bale plays this role brilliantly, delivering great lines, and giving the audience a character that both frightens, disturbs and entertains at the same time. Performances, although minor by other characters such as Jared Leto and Reese Witherspoon are also good too. Featuring enough pop culture references, it avoids being pretentious by instead of making the film appear cultured, it gives depth to the character and by that, making him more terrifying. The screenplay captures the want for wealth and money so well that the film becomes painfully realistic. Although this may never be the case because it is hard to relate to Bateman's hatred for all forms of life, it does present the characters as being wealth- obsessed and smug, but most importantly, how impossible it is to hide a hatred. Despite the over-the top violence, the deliberately cheesy lines and the exercise scenes featuring Christian Bale that seems to have been copy and pasted out from an infomercial, never does this film seem fake in any context.The film does fall short of being sometimes direction less in its aims and a lot of violence does seem for shock value. People may find it to be emotionally vapid at times, due to its lack of morals or convictions, but American Psycho is recommended due to its realism and performances",American Psycho
453,thepsychocritic,Funny murders are always a sight worth beholding.,8,8 January 2012,"Having a psycho, or a lunatic, as the protagonist does make things a whole lot easier for a director. He/she doesn't have to justify anything the protagonist does, because all the acts he commits, regardless of how unfeasible or irrational they are, are forgiven since he is a psychopath. The 'W' word of inquisition is tossed out of the window. For instance, in this film, Patrick Bateman hacks people to death, tries to feed a cat into an ATM machine and hides decapitated heads in his freezer, and all of these atrocities pass unquestioned, for he is, as the title proclaims, the American Psycho. Americans have really begun scaring me now. American Pie came up with some of the most outrageous sex ideas ever, American Beauty was a thoroughly unsettling experience and American Psycho is eerily disturbing. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a narcissistic banker living alone in a posh New York apartment. He lives a stereotypical banker life - have a girlfriend, sleep with another, a music afiocinado and flirting with his secretary - nothing that calls specific attention to him. However, the banker is just a facade he adopts to fit into the normal world - a Dr. Jekyll to his inner My. Hyde. He has an alter-ego residing inside him, one that has only two emotions - greed and and disgust - and wants to kill people in the most remorseless and sadistic ways imaginable, because that is his definition of catharsis. Patrick Bateman isn't merely misanthropic, he is quite literally the epitome of cruelty. He is a the kind of person who watches The Texas Chainsaw Massacres while exercising, and for whom the hardest conundrum in life is whether he wants to get his next victim with a nail-gun or a chainsaw. The character of a straight-faced murderer is not just disturbing, but also funny, in a morbid way. Despite having a dark and uncanny atmosphere, the ironies and the obvious pleasure that Bateman gets from heinously murdering hobos, peers, hookers and even random pedestrians with utter indifference makes you cringe and smile at the same time. Every time an axe hacks into his co-worker's flesh with a dull thud as Hip To Be Square plays in the background, you can't help but guiltily laugh to yourself. The murders follow a well established and contemplated about modus operandi and have an aftermath too. Bateman doesn't just kill people. He premeditates the commission, derives ecstasy during the act, and then sits back and relaxes, smoking a cigar, while admiring his handiwork. Bale carries the role of this two-faced beast with perfection. His poker-face maintains the facade, but his frigid gaze gives away the rather inconvenient and a whole lot frightening truth. What is interesting, is that the film maintains a light-air through the gruesome occurings, like a reflection of the protagonist himself. It talks about visiting cards, about the plethora of cosmetics Patrick uses, often to the sound of a piano cortet or otherwise ebullient music in the background. Even Patrick's apartment is refreshing with clean, white walls, which is an amusing dichotomy with Patrick himself. Not everything is froody with the film. A character like Patrick Bateman could have become a modern-day icon, if only he had more deeper and an insight had been presented into his psyche. His murders, his vicious idiosyncrasies all seem superficial, making the viewers wonder who he really is, or what made him this way. Between masquerading as a lackadaisical banker and a rabid psychopath, he never really offers an explanation to why he is the man he is. Childhood trauma, car accident, sexual harassment - nothing. Another disappointing is that the movie introduces too many people without offering a satisfactory ending to all. There is a detective who just doesn't appear in the last thirty minutes, people whose purpose is only to stand by the side of the normal Patrick, a mistress who purpose on screen remains mysterious and even a girlfriend who seems to have been tossed into this mayhem for no reason whatsoever. These, however, are trivial things in the bigger scale of things. The movie has an ambiguous ending, and this by far, is my favourite part of the film. It lets you choose your own path to reach a satisfying conclusion, but there's one, and the most likely, that asks a really provoking question - who really is more beastly, Patrick or the world? After Patrick commits his crimes, the world and its people try to bury them. Towards the ending, Patrick wanders into his peers apartment where he has stashed away many of the bodies, to find it clean and painted sparkly white, as if nothing ever happened there. The landlady creeps up to him for behind and asks him to leave and to never return, which if pondered upon, is a ghastly and horrifying concept.",American Psycho

I constantly imagine myself reading the screenplay being like WHAT THE HELL and i invite you to do that. Thanks to the talented work of Christian Bale and Marry Harron we have this masterpiece, this was their work, i can´t imagine DiCaprio doing this, it wouldn´t be the same.

455,pro-andy,best film of 2000!!!,9,18 January 2001,"wazup... i´ve been reading the book american psycho and was very happy when I first heard that it would be a movie based on the boojm and that Christan Bale was casted as Pat Bateman. Then I heard that Leonardo Dicaprio was casted and I almost fainted. He was not man enough to play a serial-killer with his baby-face. Then (thank god), Bale was again casted and the movie came out. First of all, I can only see 2 people do that part. 1. Christian Bale and 2. Christian Slater. They are both cool and can perform well in a part like that but I think that Christian Bale was perfect. My favourite scene was definitely when he played ""hip to be square"" and killed Paul Allen with an axe in the livingroom and then smokes a cigarette with blood in his face. The movie is very hard to explain since it is a story of a very strange man :-) But I think that the movie was even better than the book, which I thought wasn´t possible. Willem Dafoes part seems to have been cut down and that´s perhaps the only reason why I does not give it a 10... Best film of 2000!!! 9/10      andy olzon",American Psycho

457,chain67,Very Smooth but gory thriller,8,22 April 2000,"American Psycho is a classic in it's own mind. Yes some people like myself might enjoy it, some people will be disgusted by it and some people will hail it as a masterpiece, but overall this is just a very smooth, stylish and entertaining bloodbath.   But for a bloodbath with a lot of nudity American Psycho has a coherent story, excellent acting and a chilling if not satisfying conclusion. Give 90% of this movies credit to Christian Bale who is excellent as Patrick Bateman the very cool, handsome and smooth wallstreet trader who by night kills for fun.    The novel could of been translated better had Mary Harron not tried so hard to avoid an NC-17 and cut many scenes. Willem Dafoe gets quite annoying at times as the detective on Bateman's trail and Jared Leto is perfectly cast as smooth trader Paul Allen who has a nicer business card than Bateman. Witherspoon is average as Bateman's fiance Evelyn.    This movie won't please horror fans as much as it will please fans of smooth, entertaining thrillers. Overall 9 out of 10",American Psycho
458,alexeykorovin,Great movie but not a masterpiece because of strange ending,8,2 December 2012,"A very good movie about the life of rich people who do nothing for their money, get bored and seek extreme sensations to get rid of boredom. The acting is great, and there are some terrific scenes. It's well worth watching and you'll find yourself thinking about this moving for a day or two after you've watched it.The ending however left me with a strange feeling. I'd expect this movie to go on for like 15 more minutes and give some explanation: did he really kill those people? What of what the spectator has seen is true and what's the main character's imagination? I went to IMDb to read reviews to clear this up since I thought maybe I've skipped or misunderstood something. But indeed, the author just doesn't give an answer and like some guys say, it's all the same if the character actually killed or just imagined killing. Well, this is OK but the ending is still too abrupt. If the author wanted us to think that there is no difference if he killed or not, he should have chewed on this for some more time in the ending. I mean it's OK if the film leaves me guessing, but in this case it's just too much guessing and guessing in a slightly wrong area (not the moral or conceptual things but just unexpectedly missing parts in the plot).",American Psycho
459,JC_Ride,"""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman...",10,10 June 2020,"Some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me"". At first glance one might think that this is a horror film about ""the perfect psychopath"". It isn't. The movie deals excessively with themes of identity and standing out, and it also serves as a powerful critique to yuppie culture and late 1980s America in general. The cast is extremely talented but Christian Bale steals the show, with his memorable portayal of a completely insane individual.Patrick Bateman is a walking contradiction. The personification of greed and insanity hiding behind the mask of a good looking yuppie. He spends the entire intro describing his morning routine, but then later in the movie he's snorting coke in a public bathroom. He goes on about helping the poor, and later on stabs a tramp to death for no good reason.The slightest of things irritates him. He won't let people touch him and he shakes when he sees a business card that's perhaps slightly better than his. In fact thay simple card is his motivation to kill Paul Allen. He takes pleasure in killing and dismembering prostitutes, and as the film progresses he dives into insanity to the point were he can barely descern reality. His girlfriend and friends have zero meaning whatsoever to him. He doesn't work, all he cares about is music and getting reservations at fine restaurants, and murdering people of cource.Other that the incredible portrayal of Bateman, the movie also comes with very nice cinematography with extreme attention to detail, great acting and a killer soundtrack. The movie is chilling but also hilarious due to the sheer ridiculousness of Batemans character.But what i think sets this movie apart and makes it worth a 10/10 is the ending. The whole absurd sequence of Patrick feeding a stray cat to an ATM and randomly murdering people leads to him breaking down and confessing everything, finally seeking to be punished for his heinous crimes. But that won't come. Cause society doesnt care. The real estate agent that sells Paul Allens apartment takes care of the bodies Patrick has dismembered just to sell the apartment, and when he comes and she realises he's the killer, she just tells him to leave. Whenever Patrick confesses to his crimes noone believes him or they mishear his words. And even when he confesses everything to his lawyer, he doesnt even recognise him and thinks it's a prank cause he recently had dinner with the murdered Paul Allen. So was it all in Batemans head? Was it all real? Was parts of it real and parts of it figments of Patricks twisted imagination? Did he even kill Paul Allen? Or did the lawyer mistook Paul for another person, since it's a common thing in the movie for people not to be able to recognise one another. Regardless, Patricks ""catharsis"" won't come. He's trapped in this meaningless life of fancy suits, dinner reservations and senseless murder that goes unpunished. I don't think sharing my opinion of what trully went down is important, half the fun of the movie is figuring out the messages and interpreting the story as you wish.A masterfully crafted dive into insanity. A solid 10/10 from me!",American Psycho

461,wezzel,Glory of the 80s,8,3 January 2002,"Let's throw in a cliche and say that the book was better then the film. The book was kind of a 'Bridget Jones Diary' for fruitcakes, and was not only shocking but often really funny.  The movie isn't shocking, since all the violence happens off-screen, and though it has some funny moments (the scene with the namecards!) it just can't surpass the brilliance of the novel. One of the main problems was christian Bale.  Don't get me wrong, he did a good acting job, but I just didn't believe him as Patrick Bateman.  The person I had in mind after reading the book was someone completely different. Another thing that bothers me were the Willem Dafoe and Reese Witherspoone storylines that both ended up nowhere.

462,jmgimbel,Misunderstood film,9,20 June 2021,"American Psycho has more than a touch of irony and isn't really about murder.It was an homage to the extreme excess and greed of the 80s, with no one at the top accountable. The invincibility of youth as a trust fund baby, doing everything at full speed, women, drugs, et al. Being concerned with the facade of life than bothering to examine it or relationships and the inherent loneliness that inspired.It's funny af if not taken literally.

And I absolutely loved it, I understand why people have problems with it and call it misogynistic but they simply miss the point tbh. Bateman is absolutely brutal and watching Bale's performance is just enticing and brilliant, one of his best (at least of what I've seen). Love this film, I wish the ending was a bit more conclusive as I like closure. An open ending that makes you think can work, and this is probably an example of one. But still I would of preferred a definite ending. Although this is not really a comedy I found myself laughing occasionally at the obscurd things Bateman tries to do for example (not really a spoiler) but when he tried to put a stray cat in the ATM.

464,nyancatcandy,The neatest film of all time,8,15 April 2019,"A performamce that launched Christian Bale's career like a rocket into the sky, that also proves what an astonishing and adaptable actor he is. Playing the main role as Patrick Bateman he carries the show forward through murder and despise, in a film that is set to cause horror amongst viewers.Even though Bale is the standout performer, other small roles like Willem Dafoe's character Donald Kimball and Stephen Bogaert as the lawyer Harold Carnes, all help to create the unsettling and tense nature of the film. It's an aura that constantly keeps the watchers at unease, making them feel the same way as Patrick about his cowerkers: That they indeed are pretentious self-focused phonies.Another great thing about this film is the neat and clever use of sound effects, such as the famous scene where Patrick and his coworkers compete over who has the finest business card, where you can her small ""whooshes"" and flings as they show each other their cards. And even the neat sounds coming from their expensive shoes as they walk down the street. Neat is a great word to summarise thia film, and it is neat in more ways than the sound effects. From the previously mentioned nice looking business cards and the shiny leather shoes, to Patricks shower routines and his and his cowerkers visits to keen restaurants.The cinematography and lightning of this film is also very good, making every scene that much more frightning and that much more good looking. The tone of lightning in this film is consistent and also the tone of the film itself, further emphasising the neat feeling of the movie.The most spectacular thing about this movie though, is the uncertainty placed in Patricks visions and behaviour. It is clear that he is not psychologically well, and carries som clear anger issues. But is he really capable of murder? Does everything really unfold as he perceives it? The viewer only ever gets to see his perspective and one begins to wonder how much of it is actually real. This uncertainty is great, and in the end, the viewer is left wondering who Patrick Bateman really is, and what actually happened.The downside of this film is perhaps that it didn't hit as hard as it could have. It touches the edge of a masterpiece, but just falls short due to the way it impacts the viewer; not as much as it could have. It is true that it is a great story, with great acting, but it didn't make you feel that discombobulated or perplexed or astound, especially the ending, which is no way bad, infact it is really great, it just didn't impact the same way other movies have, such as Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island or Christopher Nolan's memento.Nevertheless, this is a fine piece of a movie, with great acting, a great story, and a great conclusion, making for the perhaps neatest film of all time. Well that played to Mary Harron!",American Psycho

468,selenedm999,the book was ahead of its time**possible spoilers**,5,13 August 2005,"and the movie was a bit behind.Although I try not to compare books and movies, because they are NOT the same medium, and for this reason don't occupy the same headspace, this movie made me realize all the reasons I enjoyed the book so much.Bret Easton Ellis' novel was shocking for its time for a few simple reasons: mostly, in the movies if not in real life, the late 80s were perceived as a time of tremendous greed and affluence, but also of a strange kind of innocence, like little kids at play. Bateman's existence was one of endless consumption and of doing all the things that people watching beer commercials could only dream about. This led to a complete lack of morality or consequence, and his boredom led him to kill (at least in his own mind) because there really wasn't anything that he couldn't have or experience. He's the perfect textbook narcissist/sociopath, and at a time when psychology was still hanging onto the idea that killers are made out of abuse, not simply born to consume until something external takes care of them.Next, the book was shocking because of its explicitness. The scenes of gruesome killings and the gratuitous sex were things that back then had only been around in the porn industry, but that was the point--if you have everything, where's the next kick? And in the late 80s (I believe the book came out in 1990 or 1991), when there wasn't nearly so much access to every kind of appetite imaginable, this concept still had the power to raise eyebrows. And turn stomachs.The movie tries very hard, and it has its high points (particularly Christian Bale in the shower, whoot!)...but it was released a decade too late to really accomplish anything close to what the book did. And through the Nineties, with access to the Internet and sadomasochistic imagery on billboards, our access to the dark side of our own appetites has made Bateman's sex and killing kind of pedestrian, almost quaint. ""Oh, look, he's videotaping himself f**king a hooker, how cute!"" Even the D-I-Y spirit of the movie, casting Bale instead of a big Hollywood name draw, is just one in a long line of movies to take risks like that. ho hum. I was waiting to see the scene where he cuts off a head and screws it, and the only reference to that was the head in the refrigerator. What a letdown! And there were so many cruel yet comical scenes in the book that could have been in the movie without getting censored, like the scene where he dips a urinal cake in Godiva chocolate and feeds it to his girlfriend...where was that? Why was it cut in favour of his asshole friends yakkety-yakkety? At the end of the movie, you don't get the sense of relief that none of it was real the way you do reading the book. In fact, you only get the sense that it's another day, and for some reason, this doesn't bother you at all. I don't think that's quite what the director intended. It's not a bad movie by any means, and Bale is great eye candy, but it tries hard to remind us of the late 80s and we're made all the more aware that it's 2005. (or 2000, when the film came out)",American Psycho
469,knows_film,This movie makes me want to get a business card with a watermark.,10,9 January 2007,American Psycho is way better than Psycho.Alfred Hitchcock passed on American Psycho in favor of Psycho because American Psycho was too American for him. Being British he couldn't handle the Americanism of the subject matter.Originally Patrick was to be Norman's Father. But given the 40 year window of their release dates; it's now Norman who is Patrick's father. Which probably works better; like Luke in Starwars the force is stronger in Patrick and he becomes a better psycho than his father. BUT both the bates are good its just Patrick is the better bate's man.American Psycho is the must see film of the decade. I haven't seen a better constructed; intellectually executed slasher film since before the genre was incepted.

470,meet_the_feebles,Feelings in the 80s'!,10,26 July 2001,"I believe Patrick Bateman is a symbol for the shallow eighties. A decade ruled by Super-Yuppies and their coke. Patrick Bateman is a man for the eighties, by the eighties and of the eighties. Too many people try too hard to find a stupid reason behind every movie, if things aren't spelled out most people cry and complain about it. So is the case with American Psycho (which I hear a sequel is being made, probably for all the dimwits so they can have a movie with the same title that they get.)There's isn't much to say about this amazing movie other than it's funny, it's got a jumpin' eighties soundtrack, it's terrifying, it's bloody, and the score is great.

471,ArtistGrl,"Enjoyable, but not a masterpiece",8,13 February 2002,"First and foremost: This is not a gory horror movie, despite the way it seems to be advertised everywhere... It's something like a drama / dark satire. (But not everyone might find it funny).The movie itself is quite well done. The cinematography is perfect (though made me a bit sad seeing it after the Sept 11 disaster). I really appreciated the fact they didn't make a horror flick out of this one - there are almost no visibly gruesome parts, only ""suggestions"". The music is even better, really gives this movie an upbeat 80s feel and stays relevant to the story. The acting is nice too, though I didn't find it entirely convincing sometimes. The only real complaint I have about this movie is the plot. Doesn't really seem to be going anywhere, and I personally would've liked a closure.Overall, it's more like an arty portrait of Bateman than a thriller.",American Psycho
472,adam_pittavino,Dont you want to know what i do?,10,13 June 2018,"Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 novel of the same title gave readers the perfect insight to America's corporate obsession with materialism as greed and escess seemed to replace what was wholesome and warm about the decade before it. The 1980's is the right environment for an emotionally bankrupt, ego driven maniac to pursue his blood thirsty tendencies as Christian Bale dishes up Patrick Bateman, one of cinemas most talked about characters in recent memory. Patrick works on wall street. He's a sneering, condesending, selfish and shallow psychotic that commits blatant, random acts of violence, his pseudo-preppie diction noticeable but not unfamilier when in social circles. One memorable scene has Bateman comparing buisness cards with his colleague's, a fierce undertone of jealousy washes over him as he realises their offerings maybe be more impressive than his own. On the surface, his personality fits in with the crowd he surrounds himself with, but his disregard for peoples feelings, let alone their lives is what ultimetely drives his lust for killing. American Psycho isnt overly gory, it isnt overly violent, but its ambitious and confident and these traits are what made it one of the best films of the year. American Psycho is many things, part black comedy, part horror but above all its a satire on a generation that knows no limits.",American Psycho
473,mjuice,"Creepy, edgy, funny. Gets better every time you see it.",9,16 June 2003,"The first time I watched this movie, I expected to see some stupid slasher flick, with a crazed anonymous killer killing people for no good reason, the goal of the film merely to scare people.Well, American Psycho is basically the opposite of that.  The whole idea here is to open up the killer to you, to show you his mind, why he kills, what his world is like.  This is really a much more interesting subject than the fear of random attack victims.  Inside Patrick Bateman's mind (masterfully played by Christian Bale), we are introduced to a mind where nothing has value, where even the idea of value is absent.  All that is left is fashion, having a great body, eating at the most popular restaurants, having a good job with the best business cards. Particularly poignant is the way he relates to music.  He has heard what music is popular and has clearly read reviews of it but he can do no better than mechanically quote these, since he doesn't know what is valuable about it.What's more, Bateman can never succeed in any of this, but instead finds an urge to destroy, both out of jealousy, and as some kind of misplaced sexual urge.  Part of this is inscrutable, of course, as (for most people) it is impossible to truly relate to someone like this character...There is a great deal here to be consumed by a voracious viewer.  Don't just watch this movie once, watch it repeatedly and you will begin to understand better and better.  Even if this isn't your aim, Bateman's unique brand of creepiness is radiant and infective.  And this will scare you way more than any slasher movie... though it may not make you jump quite as much.",American Psycho

475,yucel81x,A triumph or a travesty? Does it matter?,9,17 June 2002,"After numerous attempts to watch this movie from beginning to end (not from lacking the stomach to stand the graphic nature of many of the scenes, but simply from countless interruptions), I've finally seen this film in its entirety. Having only read bits and pieces of the book (enough to understand that the book was far more lurid and explicit), I can't comment on just how well the film adapted the novel. However, I can comment on the film and its own merits...and it has many.First of all, the direction and photography are wonderful. The atmosphere of the yuppie and materialist world of 1987 is captured beautifully through the sterile gaze of the New York high-rises and designer business suits. The soundtrack is a great melange of '80's pop songs and an engaging symphonic score. The acting is top-notch from all parties, especially the lead. Christian Bale delivers well as a man without soul or conscience while at the same time appealing to our sensibilities, imparting on our forgiveness, and feeding off our own morbid fantasies. And that is exactly what this movie is about.Bale portrays Patrick Bateman, the ultimate example of young urban professional materialist culture. From the unemotional narration, to the blank expressions on his face (even when he smiles, we can see right through the facade and see the emptiness), everything about Bale's performance conveys the mental illness of Bateman. Chloe Sevigny is a treat as his secretary, the one person throughout the movie who actually touches the slightest glimmer of humanity he may possess.Some people I know have panned this movie because of the confusing ending and the lack of real action. What these people fail to realize is that this film is not about a serial killer, nor is it the testimonial of a man confessing his sins. It is a story about a psychotic...the difference lies in that while a serial killer story would be simplistic, this is far more complex. By the end, we question whether or not Bateman actually killed anybody, how he could've been getting away with it, and even if any of the movie ever actually happened. All the tiny clues are there, from people not noticing bloodstains to someone thinking he said ""Mergers"" instead of ""Murders."" Is he really a killer? This should not be the question...rather the question should be if the man is crazy...the answer. Yes. In the sickest, most twisted possible way the story could end, we see just how insane Patrick Bateman is...and it is utterly eerie.""American Psycho"" is a movie that pushes the limits of the audience's ability to cope, for a number of reasons. A film told from the point of view of a psychotic is harsh enough, but the film also beckons the audience to question their own sanity. You're forced to look at your own sensibilities and morals and put them to the test...can you condone Bateman's actions and thoughts? Do you agree with them? Sometimes you find yourself saying yes to these questions, and for this some people may call it a travesty. By the same token, it pushes the envelope...thus it could even be called a triumph. Be warned...this is not a film for all tastes, but one thing is certain...it is one of a kind.",American Psycho

My pain is constant and sharp. And I do not hope a better world for anyone.In fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape. ""But I am not sure if the cast, acting, camera , music were overwhelmingly supporting this moral message.Though there were a couple of scenes I loved.One was when Patrick wants to kill Jean scene where he says ""Put it in the carton"" to Jean warning for the spoon she was going to put on the table.I love this about his obsession with order and neatness. This was also a reflection about his concerns about his face, body,
dressing that he is putting so much energy for the life style his surrounding expect him to be.Another scene was when Patrick and his business friends showing off their business cards he goes mad with jealousy , because Paul Allens card looks better
There should have been more scenes showing off Patrick's greed, jealousy, and resentment in more horrifying but also subtle way.And he also hates himself for all this
But the link between his hate of himself, and his murders were not strong.Also about the cast, I have doubts if Christian Bale was the right person for this movie.I think only two characters were ahead of others giving more enjoyment.One is Jean (Chloë Sevigny), and other one is detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe)",American Psycho
478,joedamato-1,As realistic as it gets,7,17 December 2004,"American psycho is black comedy  the ""pulp fiction"" of horror/thriller genre with Christian Bale's excellent performance. As believable as it gets! Bale's character Patrick Bateman's does nothing but renting horror movies, bringing prostitutes into his house, having sex and taping it, figuring out what kind of visit card to have, doing presses each morning, doing face masks, taking care of his body's handsomeness. One day he meets Paul Allen. This guy somehow pisses Patrick off. Patrick invites him to see his place and axes. For the fans of the original ""Texas chainsaw massacre 74"", there's a pleasant surprise  it's one of Patrick's favorites here There's an episode Patrick's doing exercises watching it. Later he'll ""use"" the chainsaw himself. Perhaps some of you will find ""American psycho"" lame, but it's really deep. The point is  one day Patrick realizes that he's nobody in this life and when he sees a homeless man with a dog, he is mostly afraid of the same thing will happen to him. And he commits his first murder. I just hated that part. Despite of that scene, the rest of movie has a really slight violence. I say the general part makes black comedy. The scene where Patrick completely naked holding a chainsaw pursues his favorite hooker after she sees the dead bodies is funny. This film can be understood many ways, but the main moral I think is  one don't have to be look like a degenerate, walk with a saw, kitchen knife or an ax under the coat, wear a mask or somebody's skinned face (like Leatherface) to be a maniac killer. The only problem is the seduction of this film. Don't get me wrong, but it has some. Really!",American Psycho

Those who have read the book will know that some scenes have been left out, however this is made up by Christian Bales alikeness to the character Patrick Bateman, he plays this character perfectly... Patrick Bateman: ""My need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale cannot be corrected, but, ah, I have no other way to fulfil my needs""Another good point to the film is that its not as gory as the book but thats okay Patrick Bateman: My nightly blood lust has overflown into my days I feel lethal on the verge of frenzy, I think my mask of sanity is about to slip...Overall the script has been well written and the use of a female director excludes the male dominant need for the main character to kill everyone and have an explosive action scene.

Having not yet read the book, and hearing that it had been toned down for the big screen, I still was expecting some pretty horrific scenes.  The following comments may be SPOILERS so don't read if you don't want to know what happens.
The amount of blood and grusome murders in this film were severely lacking. Let me just say that I am not a perverted maniac who gets off on this kind of thing, but to make the film work properly, and to really grasp the horror of this psycho, it needed more to shock an audience. For example, when Patrick chops off the blokes head, you only see blood and a slumped out of focus leg on camera, very tame indeed. I thought it would be more Texas Chain Sawish, where there were some quite horrible moments, but it was not to be.  The acting was good, and Bale played his vain businessman excellently.  The whole cast were good but the camera direction let it down.Overall I would recommend, but not really an 18 in my book, apart from a lot of sex, but even those scenes were quite tame, with no frontal shots of the women at all.  Even Life of Brian has one of them!! I give it a seven out of ten.  Wait for the video, and a dark night alone in the house....",American Psycho

487,dominicpearson,Superb!,8,25 April 2010,"Having now read the book twice and seen the film three times I thought it about time to put my thoughts down in black and white. The short of it is that I loved this film; just when you think you have it sussed out it throws another curve ball at you.I don't intend to spend much time considering the plot or the well known themes and questions it throws up (the blending into society, the facelessness of individuality, the materialism and commercialism of modern life etc etc) as these have been covered splendidly in the FAQ section and I could not do them any further justice.My personal, humble opinion it is all in his head; the ending of the book ""This Is Not An Exit"" seemed to me to suggest that his fantasy's were a way out of the mundaity and blandness of his existence. Having said that each time I watch the film or reconsider the book I am left with that grey area that at least some of it may have been very real and then wondering which parts may and may not have been!! I watched the film having read the book first (as I am sure many others will have done). What struck me was the skill with which the very dense, at times difficult to read dialogue had been condensed into a screenplay that very strongly retained the overriding themes of the book. The style of the film captured perfectly the scenery created by the extremely (overly?) descriptive prose in the book and at no time did it feel rushed. At no time did I think that more should have been included; the choices made when preparing the screenplay (i.e. what to include and what to leave out) were spot on and the focus on Bateman himself with less concentration on the peripheral characters in his life worked perfectly (these were, in fact, the parts of the book that felt contrived and out of place so I was happy with the choices for this reason as well).It amused me sincerely that the film was adapted and directed by a female. After all the furore by silly feminist women who clearly did not understand the satire in the book and who chose to concentrate on the graphic depiction of violence against women it must be great for Brett Easton Ellis to be able to say ""F*** you"" to them. This film and the book before it are not about gratuitous violence. The story is about greed, about jealously, about psychosis, about a person lost in a myriad of similarity where you cannot break out even if you try and even if those attempts are bloody, violent and evil. There are so many layers to the story that to dismiss it as a one dimensional attempt to shock is doing it a massive disservice. And I think (hope) that anyone watching the film will realise this.Onto the performances. Christian Bale is, as ever, superb. I am a massive fan of his (apart from Terminator - is it not enough that you're Batman!!) and always look forward to watching his films. He is at his very best here. Batemans facade is slowly slipping as his private world of madness seeps into his personal world and Bale pulls this off with the subtlest of changes in his facial expressions and demeanour. The two telephone conversations (first to his lawyer, second to his secretary) towards the end of the film show the full extent of his psychosis and the fact that his mask has well and truly slipped. The realisation that he has got away with it (and more importantly will continue to get away with it) and his pulling himself back together at the end of the film are all, again, acted perfectly. Contrast the character at the start of the film with that at the end, consider the ""journey"" he has been on and everything in between and then think about how another, less skilled actor could have killed this film. Without Bale this film would not have worked. He IS Patrick Bateman and that is the skill and talent that I so greatly admire.The supporting cast are fine if not a little bland. Reese Witherspoon is wasted and Batemans colleagues are given very little screen time but therein, I suppose, lies the point. This is a film about an egotistical, maniacal loner who has no love for humanity in any way, shape or form. It seems only right that the relationships he so clearly has no yearning for are not fleshed out any further. Still, it would have been nice to have had a little more depth and a further half hour or so would have done the world of good and probably pushed this into the higher regions of scoring.As it is this is a really, really enjoyable film that works on so many levels. You will enjoy it as a stand alone film given the performances, writing and direction but those who want to think about it further and make their own judgement on the questions will have plenty to keep them busy.Highly recommended.",American Psycho
488,themkody,Equally a great character-study as it is a comedy,10,1 July 2011,"This movie is, on many levels, very identical to the film ""Falling Down"", but is by no means a bad remake. In fact, both of them are equally great. This film is from back in the day, back when Christian Bale had some great roles (before he devoted himself to a lousy portrayal of Bat(-e)man.) I'd go as far and say that his portrayal of Patrick Bateman is one of the best performances of the decade.As the movie progresses, we see how Bateman minute by minute slowly turns into a cruel, ruthless monster. Already 5 minutes in, we begin to feel disgust towards him, but it is only the beginning. As weird as this sounds, every time he gets more ruthless he gets funnier too. There are even scenes where you feel disgust towards him, but on the same time can't stop laughing at the decisions he makes, combined with his use of words. It's a really thrilling (not to mention rewarding) experience. If you removed either the character-study or the humour, this would still have been a great movie. Both elements works really, really well, but the fusion of those two elements makes the film work exceptionally well.The way this film combines dark humour, madness, great performances and character study is phenomenal.

493,Nikos-12,Chilling indictment of '80s materialism,8,28 May 2000,"When Bret Easton Ellis's novel American Psycho was first published in 1991, it was described as misogynistic and sadistic by the humourless idiots who decide these things, so it comes as something of a surprise to find it adapted to the screen by two women. It centres around Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a Wall Street mergers and acquisitions man, who takes narcissism to levels even Robbie Williams couldn't imagine and kills people, mainly women, in his spare time. Bateman simply has no soul, no real identity. He merely wishes to fit in and please himself  not be happy, he has no concept of it. Such a blank slate inevitably reflects its surroundings. Unfortunately, these are the 1980s and Bateman is at the top of the greedy tree. He obsesses about facial cleansing, Armani suits and business cards. After he is laughed at when asking for a table at an exclusive restaurant at the last minute, he lashes out at a helpless homeless man. A flood gate seems to have been opened in his psyche and he meticuluosly and savagely kills a fellow broker who believes he is someone else. The women follow, but we don't see them, we see Bateman's normal everyday life continue unaffected. A policeman (Willem Dafoe) arrives to investigate the disappearance of the broker, but he doesn't come back. In the end, Bateman, trying harder and harder to get caught, can take it no more, but his society will not let him take credit, will not grant him an identity.Bale is utterly flawless as Bateman, exuding a cool that is superhuman. Chloë Sevigny is excellent as his dim but human secretary and Defoe fills the screen as the cop eerily similar to Bateman. As a satire of the awful '80s this is great stuff (Whitney Houston seriously deserved being taken down a peg or two), humorous and observant. You cannot help but feel, though, that the decade doesn't really merit such an intellectual mauling; the gentle humour of The Wedding Singer, for instance, was sufficient.",American Psycho
494,dan9241,"Wonderful, but not what I expected",7,12 April 2000,"Having heard all of the hype about the twisted violence and sick imagery of the book, I was very curious as to how I would react to this movie. Movie violence usually doesn't bother me, but on occasion, I have been incredibly disturbed (example - ""I Spit On Your Grave"" which I could not sit through again). Here, though, I was very surprised to see very little violence, suspense or blood. This so-called ""sick"" movie was not sick at all. Despite not being scared, I thought that the movie did a wonderful job at satirizing the business world in the late 1980's (and it featured a great sound track of 80's music!). When I walked out, I was feeling a bit disappointed - not just by the under usage of the immensely talented Reese Witherspoon and Chloe Sevigny - but by the story itself. I wanted to know more. But the more I thought about it on the way home, the more I liked the way the movie handled the story. It really made me think, and it featured some very interesting twists.

(Some Spoilers),7,23 February 2003,"I only read the Book half way through-I left it because the gory parts are in the latter chapters - Patience is not one of my virtues.I must say the movie is better, because the violence starts in 20 minutes. If Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lector is voted the most scariest movie Serial Killer, then Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman is the Sexiest-he sure does get my vote on the shower scenes and aerobic routes. Bale is the first choice, and I am glad Leo DiCaprio left the role because imagine a boy with an axe!?! it reminds me of Children of the corn.Set between October 1987 and February 1988, British-Born Bale gives a bravura performance as a Yuppie working on Wall Street-which was in fashion to have wealth at that time. Patrick Bateman maybe devastatingly handsome, charming, dressed in Valentino Couture, highly intelligent, great career but becomes a Serial Killer - hey! nobody's perfect!?! As Bateman, his wooing technique that Serial Killers undergo to lessen the victim's defences-is scary, his persuasive gibberish to make his victim's unaware of his deliberate actions onto them can give you the shakes.Reese Withespoon is wonderful and a great-looking actress to play Bateman's fiancée who is not treated well, and Matheson as the Mistress that does not get treated any better - they get cabs to go out with Bateman, but he later rides in a Limo to attract Victims!!Chole Sevigny kicks ass as a naive Secretary, who later is pardoned by Patrick Bateman.There are scenes that are wrong about Serial Killers, for example Patrick is running around with a Chainsaw in a public condo-which is too noisy for any Serial Killer to use because they must be stealthy to kill a victim, and avoid getting caught. That also includes being butt naked!But on the whole, it is a movie to show people what is it like to be a Serial Killer-and it can be a B****, when a lot of fantasies of violence run though your mind at any given time and you gotta allure people into your trap to ease your urge to torture and murder, oh and don't forget a souvenir and dispose the body, visit the scene of crime to get more satisfaction of your urges ...Oh boy! it is not easy huh!?!(Spoiler starts here) This movie is not half-bad, better than some movies I have seen, especially American Psycho 2-what a waste of negatives!!You can tell number 2 is crap when somebody who is not 'Christian Bale' is now playing Bateman, and how can a weak little girl kill off a Serial Killer that has a good physique? what I dread is that girl said""I want to track down other Serial Killers - I can't wait to grow up"" Agggggggggghhhhhh! why did I rent this darn film??Then Yasmin Bleeth look-a-like Mila Kunis from the 70's Show turns up, OK!! she is attractive, but her acting and her vocal narration -Sheeeeeesh let's not go there! and how did she ever get to be a surviving Victim?

All the dark things bubbling beneath the Wall Street psyche, and the American upper class psyche in general, are raised to the surface with this film. It feels clear to me that all the executives shown in the film are very similar to Bateman, only their sociopathy is better hidden, obscured even to themselves. In Bateman the inner chaos battles for control with reality. He tells us that what's inside his head doesn't matter, but of course the inside and outside are blending together, driving his life out of control. What this film accomplishes is very rare. It approximates a message about the modern era without having to stick on some morality play or quest for political redemption (because, after all, on Wall Street today there is still no salvation).

502,stemage,"Great idea, great book, not enough movie",4,22 October 2001,"The concept behind American Psycho is an original one, and it is THAT concept that encouraged most people to see it, but it's just so underdeveloped.  There IS some development as far as our ""one"" character is concerned, but most of his ramblings don't explain his strange condition anymore than his actions do (if that makes sense).  Those seeking explanation and understanding of the main character are left with much to be desired, while people just sitting through the movie are left totally confused (but forget those people, this is an artsy flic).  The last line of the movie tries to explain it all in a single blow cutting to the credits even before you really get a chance to consider what he just said.  American Psycho takes the format of a thriller or horror with lulls in between scenes of climactic events.  Basically, while most of these movies put the viewer through a series of situations furthering the plot making you think more, only to be resolved (or somewhat resolved) in the end, this feature sends the mood up and down while explaining nothing.  You never understand what the motivation is behind the murders at ALL, which is understandable if that was the intent, but NO motivation can sometimes translate to the viewer as NO plot, and that is simply the case.  The movie ends with a line that should knock you in the gut and make you love the movie and understand the character, but rather makes you shake your head and want to start the whole thing over to find something tangible.  It is beautifully filmed, and the confession scene is oscar worthy, but overall, the movie shoves itself across the boundaries of ""artsy"" and right of the cliff into nothing. Definitely worth the watch, but it's not life changing.",American Psycho
503,ellieforpeace,A Dark and Bloody Satire of Capitalism and Masculinity.,9,11 July 2009,"American Psycho had to be the most surprising movie ever for me. I just watched it because the title was intriguing, I had heard about it before, I figured it couldn't be so bad. I was very tired and about to sleep, but this kept me up with various conflicting emotions.It is the story of a wealthy bank executive (Christian Bale) who is greedy to reach the top, and just as bloodthirsty. As his greed grows, so does his vanity, his sexual virility, his desire for success, his yearning to kill.The screenplay is brilliant, and the direction, nearly so. Mary Haddon did both, which is stunning. She calls the movie a feminist movie, and if you think long and hard enough about it, it really is. The man, Bateman, is so vain and egocentric in a distinctly male way, and it is this that leads to his yearning for blood. Nearly all the male characters are the same, and they usually all mark their manliness through the exploitation of women.This also surprised me because of how deeply funny the movie can be at times. It is a satire of corporate greed and capitalism. There are a few points that are simple laugh-out-loud funny. Near the beginning, our main character boils with rage when his business card is outdone by another that looks exactly like his. In a scene a little later, he videotapes a threesome between himself and two hookers. He doesn't seem to derive any sexual pleasure from the women, but from admiring himself in mirrors. His long dissertations on conformity in popular music to his victims are highly amusing. He is the ultimate symbol of capitalism.I didn't really want to like this movie because of Christian Bale. He seems like a horrible person. But his acting is superb, grade A, so I cannot complain about that. This is one of his best performances (I like to think because he relates to this character so much).The only thing I have to complain about is Haddon's portrayal of violence. Bret Easton Ellis's book's very graphic descriptions of violence are what made it so controversial. However, Haddon backs away from the violence. She doesn't show much of it at all, which is a fault, because it shies away from the symbolism, and in a little bit of a way, makes the violence less of an issue, which it should not be (I subscribe heavily to the message of Funny Games).But overall, I think it's brilliant. It's demented, it's substantial, it's funny. It's kind of like an even darker American Beauty. And it all completely works.",American Psycho

505,LightDarkness14,"The beginning of the downfall, of the horror genre start with this awful porn film.",4,6 July 2011,"American Psycho is another one of THOSE movies. You know, the ones with a high-rating that just happen to suck.Lots of people rant about the downfall of horror after 1999 and although I have a lot of favorites from the 2000's I have too say they speak the truth. Horror nowadays is basically bad acting, sprinkled with bits of gore and vulgar language. This horrible movement began with this film.American Phsyco is about a 27 year-old business man named Patrick Bateman. Patrick is popular with his friends, drowns in women every night, dines at the most expensive restaurants and has a very nice business card. But what his co-workers don't know is that his smirk hides the life of a dedicated pshycopath.The films holds your interest for a good while with scenes of gratious gore and plenty of black comedy, but it's not long before we realize that American Psycho is stuck in a time-warp. The same thing happens every day. Patrick goes to work, barely conceals his psychopathic alter ego from his friends, picks up a whore, has sex and then kills the whore. Our reward? To see him do it all over again, except next time with different bland dialouge.AP had potiental, and some bits are interesting. But the final product is quite a mess. Horror fans should at least give it a viewing though. After all, some people enjoy crap. 4/10",American Psycho
506,DanielStephens1988,American Psycho is not a story about murder,9,15 July 2019,"The film looks to examine our own distorted points of view or detachments from reality. Like Patrick Bateman, we may be trapped craving the approval of others and denying ourselves the ability to distinguish fantasies from our reality.
People are obsessed with how the others perceive them likewise in American Psycho Bateman achieves no catharsis, he's trapped in his own personal hell because he requires the recognition of the other yuppies to confirm his identity as a murderer. The irony is that Feynman's real crimes may as well be fantasy. The lack of acknowledging his reality drives Bateman further into madness and existential despairIt's about yuppie culture, the melding of identity, and the craving to stand out from a superficial homogenized society. Bateman's interpretation of the world is skewed by his inflated ego and his evident psychosis as well as presumably multiple mental illnesses. Bateman is a killer, but still, he's not the killer he thinks he is, as he goes insane he can't distinguish reality from fantasy. His over the top chainsaw massacre style killings may be an aestheticized elaboration on partial truths, ultimately the film doesn't care. The more significant point of the movies absurdity is that within his society Batemans not the psycho at all he's just one more normal guy amidst a horde of uncaring detached from reality, secretly discontented American psychos. Bateman is surrounded by like-minded superficial people obsessed with all the wrong things like making impossible reservations at Dorsia and the tasteful thickness of their business cards. Within the homogenized upper-class elite identities blur as everyone strives after a generic yet highly specific image of success.Everyone we see in Bateman's company appears to be the same person. It's no wonder that identity is mistaken continuously and swapped throughout the film. The lawyer has mistaken Paul Allen or perhaps Batman has killed the wrong person becomes not only plausible but also an expression of the general confusion resulting from the loss of individual identity.Meanwhile, although Batman tries like the rest to fit in, the emptiness of his lifestyle also fuels a craving to stand out. To escape the conformity that he on some level despises Batman leads a second life as a killer, where he's unfettered from the bounds of society. Although he actually wants to be seen as a murderer as someone different from the rest of society Bateman is denied even the satisfaction by every self-absorbed yuppie he meets. When he's seen stuffing a body into the trunk of a car, the witness is only interested in the bag.This is a great movie. Look for the subtext under the dialogue.",American Psycho

508,Bayjohn,"Great book, but decent movie...",8,2 January 2002,"American Psycho was for Bret Easton Ellis a chance to show the materialistic 80's in a different light.  The shallow lifestyles of the people during this era were perfectly brought to life in his novel and in Mary Harron's film. Patrick Bateman is just another one of those shallow, successful business men that dominated the scene.  However, Patrick had a obsessions and an after hours lifestyle that would sicken and disgust most everyone had they known.The biggest flaw in the film is it's inability to have the viewer guessing as to whether the horror was real or just imagined.  The novel presents the entire story in such a way that the reader does not know if the actual carnage is real or just part of Patrick Bateman's sick imagination. Although the film does try, it does not succeed.I do respect Mary Harron's choice of using the ""less is more"" principle when it comes to the violence.  The graphic depictions of violence in the novel would have made the film beyond a horror movie and more like a snuff film. The film is good and is worth viewing for those folks that lived during the exciting 1980's like I did.",American Psycho
509,iamsethh,"Hilarious and dark, sometimes stilted",8,16 April 2000,"This movie is great, but I have a taste for mixing the hilarious with the perverse. It's great to see them transposed.. it makes the dark seem darker and the light seem lighter. This movie was generally a good adaption of the book. The book is really revolting, I had to stop reading at parts and go do something else before I could continue (and I consider myself a pretty sick guy). You really couldn't sit through the movie if it portrayed what was shown in the book. The closest movie I've seen to something like that was ""Salo: 120 days of Sodom"", which didn't even come close to the violence in American Psycho (the novel). The only problem with the movie's adaption is that it left out some very telling things - like the fact that Bateman's mother is in a mental hospital, and the episode where he murders an ex-gf, which further sketches out his hostility towards women.",American Psycho
510,john-mitchell77,"Love the book, love the movie",9,13 February 2007,"American Psycho was always a book that I wanted to see made into a movie. I thought it would be amazing to see Bret Easton Ellis's masterpiece (in my opinion) make it on to the screen. I wasn't so sure, however, of how Christian Bale would do as Patrick Bateman. I didn't see him in the role at all. I don't know whom I thought would be better, but it wasn't him.I was stupid. Bale is fantastic, and rises to what is quite a challenge, extremely well. For me, his portrayal of Bateman is bang on the money. His self-obsessed, emotionally detached nut-job is every bit as unhinged and chilling as Ellis's creation. The movie itself is good, and does something very clever. It takes Ellis's gore factor away slightly, not much, but slightly, and puts a little more suggestion in.What's also in there, is the dark, dark humour of the book, which can be lost when some novels get the Hollywood treatment.All in all, a very good movie. Thumbs up for a job well done!",American Psycho
511,TheSteelHelmetReturns,One of my top ten favourite films.,10,1 October 2009,"American Psycho is a bit of a no-brainer for me, I loved that it was one of the first films during that time (I think with The Wedding Singer being the other example before that) to be a modern film set during my favourite decade, the eighties, and about the eighties. Not only that, it was set during the best part of that decade – the late eighties. The vastly underrated Mary Harron brings out the satirical edge of Bret Easton Ellis's novel and Christian Bale gives the best performance I have ever seen from him. Watching him argue with the Chinese lady at the dry cleaner reminded me of an eighties leading man like Tom Cruise or Richard Gere and to see him change from the confident yuppie with a sinisterly dark sense of humour to a pathetic whimpering psychotic bearing his soul to his lawyer's answering machine is made of win. Luckily, American Psycho goes beyond being just a showcase of Bale's acting ability thanks to the film's attention to detail in set pieces including Patrick Bateman's morning routine and the uber-modern restaurant dishes as well as a strong cast to help complement Bale's madness like Chloe Sevigny, Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto in ""that"" scene.",American Psycho
512,plu4085,"Not as good as the novel, but still...",8,22 September 2004,"*** Some minor spoilers below ***I'm a great fan of Ellis' novel, which I recently re-read, and after seeing the movie adaptation for a 2nd time recently, here are some thoughts.The movie's main problem is that it seems to lack a bit of self-confidence; both in direction and script. It does seem to want to take Ellis' labyrinthine, non-linear (except for sheer chronology) work and turn it into a ""normal"" 90-minute movie with a beginning, middle & end. Yet it doesn't go all the way there either, which would have required substantial overhaul of the whole storyline and characters. Instead it's a middle route that selects choice material from the novel, and expands some angles to create a narrative arch -- the latter being most obvious in the much expanded part for Detective Kimball, vs the novel where his part barely exists. Unfortunately, Bateman's psychological complex is so vast that it cannot be squeezed into a story about a psychopath scared of getting caught.While Ellis never fully explains what Bateman is about, he says so much about him in the novel that you feel that it's as close as we're going to get. In the movie OTOH, Bateman is still enigmatic, but with a feel of simplification. On the first view I remember thinking that the movie was too short, and that it had been brutally edited, but on the 2nd time round I see it more as an effect of the choice made for the presentation of Bateman. It may work better if you haven't read the novel, but I doubt it.OK, on the plus side: Christian Bale does a terrific job, with lots of work put into it. He has developed a whole set of deliberately artificial faces which help illustrate the emptiness of Bateman's inner life. His voice is terrific, and manages to convey contempt and hate even while the face is looking jovial. He's good in the ""horror"" segments too, truly primitive and more real, as he should be. Very good casting, and an excellent, unusual performance.The clothes, the hairstyles, the restaurants etc, all look much like they appear in Ellis' novel. I miss the hilarious rundowns of what people are wearing (the single most notable feature of the novel on the first read), but they look right and it's no great loss. Bale in particular is extremely well dressed, even for a ""Wall Street"" movie, like he should be. His apartment, and Owen's/Allen's look just right too.One case where I think the movie is *superior* to the novel is in the portrayal of Bateman's female friends, Evelyn and Courtney. In the novel they never become more than shadow creatures, interchangeable despite appearing on many dozens of pages. Thanks to great casting and well-written parts, both Reese Witherspoon and Samanta Mathis manage to give these rich-but-messed up ladies true identities. Bateman's secretary's part is much like the novel, though I think Chloe Sevigny overacts slightly in her mousiness. Another element where the movie may surpass the novel is near the end at the club, where Bateman confronts the lawyer with his confession -- this is a scene that works better as film than literature, and the movie exploits it brilliantly. Some more complaints: the Kimball cop-hunt angle doesn't really work as stated above, and I also think the gay love angle of Luis Carruthers (which is pretty effective in the novel) becomes meaningless in this drastically shortened version. The part with Christie being chased and having a chainsaw dropped on her is NOT in the novel, and seems wrong for Bateman, who thrives on physical *closeness* to his victims -- this was a real mistake in the script, IMO, esp in such a crucial scene.All over, the movie is complex and challenging, just like the novel, which is obviously very difficult to adapt. I don't think it holds a candle to Ellis' work, but I still enjoy seeing it. The second half in particular is strong, with the director finding her stride and Bale's carefully developed Bateman fitting in just right.",American Psycho
513,p_adkins2004,Bateman is the only sane character.,7,23 January 2007,"The novel, by Bret Easton Ellis, of which this film is based on is outstanding. Horrorific, darkly funny and completely entrapping it is a modern classic, and a great statement about the yuppie culture - so I had high standards for this film.Bale as Bateman was not how I envisioned the character, despite being a Bale fan I probably would have said he was mis-cast. Although he gets the charismatic and yuppie side of Bateman down to a t, the dark psychotic and broody side of Bateman is portrayed in the same over-acted manner.The film, thank god, does not choose to 'Hollywood' the novel, with the viewer still being left with an ambiguous ending, in which one must decide how much of the events actually happened and what was in Bateman's fantasy or delirium, it is never clear as it is both hinted at the he did everything and nothing - which is great. By doing this the film manages to portray the book's clear statement on reasons and not the means.Interestingly, despite being called 'Psycho' the film manages to portray one of the book's best factors - the interesting point that perhaps in Bateman is the only sane man. In the Yuppie culture and circles Bateman runs with, he is the only one with enough self-awareness to realise that the life they live is hollow, meaningless and futile - thus creating his blood lust.This film scratches the surface at what the book means and is no where near as dark, but for a 100 minute film it succeeds far more than I thought it would. Bale makes an admirable effort, and yet despite the flicks clear downfalls, there lies a enthralling and thought provoking film.",American Psycho
514,wiseguymattt,White collar spotted with blood,10,22 September 2013,"Christian Bale... Ahhh, what an actor! And BOY does he sell his psychopathic persona in this film. It was downright chilling how cold he became and how much he despised the people around him. Something I never understood about this film, though, was figuring out exactly what started or when his homicidal thoughts began. What was the medication he was on?I'm sure I could find answers to my questions from a quick Google search. Despite whatever reservations I had for this film, it's so brilliant in so many other ways. It's comical how Patrick Bateman turns from big time CEO of his father's company to a strung-out psychopathic killer with no hope of being helped. The film also did an excellent job portraying the ridiculously superficial America of the time (and still mostly to this day). I highly recommend this film for everyone, man and child. Okay, maybe not children because there are quite a few murder scenes as well as sex scenes.Overall, this movie proved to be a great piece of cinema and I hope it's forever loved and appreciated by generations to come.",American Psycho
515,movieman-46,"Slasher, with style and wit.",10,20 September 2000,"American Psycho is a rare and refreshing movie that breathes new life into the horror film genre.  However, to call American Psycho simply a slasher film, is wrong.  This film rises above all genres to become an instant classic.  Ever since the original Scream, killer movies have tried to follow a very familiar and formulaic path.  American Psycho delivers all the horror, but still tells an intriguing psychological tale of a killer in the 1980's.American Psycho tells the story of Patrick Bateman.  Bateman works on Wall Street, and is basically a rich yuppie trying to fit in.  He listens to all the latest music, like Huey Lewis and the News, and does 1,000 crunches every day.  This is Patrick Bateman by day.  By night, he must satisfy a terrible blood lust.Patrick Bateman is played brilliantly by Christian Bale.  Bale displays Bateman with an absolute coldness.  It is as if the only humanity displayed by him is when he is killing someone.  I think that Christian Bale is someone to be watched and I see Oscars in his future.  He takes on a role which he describes as being, ""an acting teachers nightmare.""  Christian Bale, however, is an absolute dream as Patrick Bateman.  To think that the role originaly belonged to Leonardo DiCaprio.  Nobody else could have played Bateman except Christian Bale.American Psycho is masterfully directed by Mary Harron.  She injects the film with a sort of style that is all its own.  Not only style, but substance.  Every scene hints at the psychological make-up of Patrick Bateman.  It's very kinetic, as it rises faster and faster to an unbelievable climax.  Overall, American Psycho is a must-see movie for those who have the stomach for it.  If possible, see the unrated version, as it shows Mary Harron's true vision.",American Psycho
516,James B.,Who cares ?,3,5 October 2000,"I watched this because it has Samantha Mathis, my favorite actress, in it. What a waste of time, as others have said.  There is not one intelligent character in this film.  I defy anyone who has seen this to name me one.The women are all pretty and dumb.  Samantha, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon are given nothing to do.  Willem Dafoe, one of the world's smartest actors, plays a private investigator who is presented with dozens of clues to Patrick Bateman's guilt, and he acts upon none of them.  If he were a real PI, he'd be starving due to his lack of skill at his profession.The ending is likewise anticlimactic and bad.  This is a professionally shot and well-acted film, I'll give it that.  Christian Bale gives a very good performance.  But why do we need to see this person's life ?  What is next - a character study of John Wayne Gacy ?  3/10.",American Psycho

518,smartbomb,Living through the 80s could make ANYONE psycho,7,5 September 2000,"Not a bad film at all.  Christian Bale is GREAT.  Stylistically it is a very, very interesting movie.  The satire of 80's culture is definitely fun to watch if you lived through it.  The dialogue is bang on and the cultural references bring back many painful memories of the idiotic trends (pet pigs anyone?)  The humour is especially sly at times.  For example, all the guys have such similiar haircuts, its futile trying to tell them apart, yet you don't really have to in order to understand the story.  It's the little jokes like that that do it for me.  In addition, the mostly off-screen violence was especially well done.The one problem with the movie is a loss of momentum.  It begins ferociously with Bateman displaying his incredible self-indulgence and force of will. Gradually this slips away as the movie's clarity becomes unfocused in parallel with Bateman's deteriorating psyche.  I think the director could've improved things for the audience either by distancing the narrative from Bateman's perceptions, or by fusing them together more tightly. Unfortunately, she sort of sits on the fence, so we're left doubting her direction.  There are also a number of awkward scenes that really didn't have much point.Still, for all the things this movie could've been, it didn't come up too short.  Definitely worth a rental and I'll be on the lookout for her next picture.",American Psycho

A couple of days later I've completely forgotten it. I think I've watched it about 3/4 times, perhaps even more. It must be the most unmemorable film I've ever seen, and I don't really know why. Possibly it's because the things that are shown to be happening aren't really happening. If they didn't happen, why bother recalling them ? The hero has problems, that much is certain, and the reason, it seems, is because he wants to fit into a totally shallow lifestyle. He must be a buttoned-up banker, mergers and executions, with fantasies. At the end he looks just like Norman Bates. Forget it, Norman, let's go bowling.",American Psycho
521,jephiachantharath,pure madness that reminds me of..,8,19 June 2012,"a clockwork orange, this whole experience just seems like a clockwork orange in a better camera view, but that's not a bad thing. What this has in common with A.C.O is its main character, they both have their own monologues, they both are into sex and violence, and they have good taste in music. I just wanted to get that out of the way, anyway back to the film I watched recently. Christian Bale, now I think of him as Batman, but i would never had suspected him to portray such madness and insanity, while keeping a cool calm persona. One of the greatest things about this film is Patrick Bateman, I feel that without him; or with a different person, that this film would be less likable and perhaps even boring. I find myself being more and more into the horror genre when I find more films like this to watch, that reminds me that I love the scene where Patrick is doing sit-ups while watching The Texas chainsaw massacre, it just shows that horror movies where the big hit of the 80's (Friday the 13th and Freddy Krueger) and as well that horror movies can play a small part in someones insanity.My final thoughts: A simply great film, it is fun to watch this film, you could get some chills off Chistian Bale's performance as the psychotic killer: Patrick Bateman, and I recommend this to anyone who like clockwork orange, likes horror movies, and even if you can see the satire of the 80's in such a grizzly way.",American Psycho

The first time I saw this movie, I changed the channel because I couldn't watch this longer then 20 minutes or so. And thats rare, considering I can probably watch the entire LOTR-trilogy without moving a muscle...The murder-scenes and some of the dialogues (usually before the killing happens) are good though, but its sad that thats just about the only thing I can find entertaining about this movie, especially for a self-proclaimed ""horror""-movie. So basically, if you like horror-movies, skip this movie, because the horror-elements are very rare in this flick.Also, what is it that people find so funny about this movie...? The only thing that brought a minor smile to my face was the infamous naked chainsaw-chase, but thats it. Maybe its not my kind of humour while others are laughing out loud watching Bateman rant on about 80's pop-music...Overall this is a nice directed movie, and unusually light and colourfull for a movie about a 'psycho'. But its a shame the writers didn't put any more inspiration and twists in this movie. Now its just a 2 hour snorefest with a few notable dialogues.Maybe I'm one of those people who ""just don't get it"", but I expect a little more entertainment from a 2 hour movie.Note for anyone into extreme metal: the Swedish black metal band Shining used one of the dialogues in they'r song ""Claws Of Perdition"" from the album ""The Eerie Cold"".",American Psycho

It appears to be a dual of Taxi Driver, the self-proclaimed elite of this movies conflicts in a strange way with the self-hating Bickle of Scorsese's masterpiece. However, they are both people to be loathed by the common man. The character in the film starts to view himself as Neitzche's superman, I believe. Excess takes him over; the film is purely set in an 80's context for this reason. He is part of the ""Me"" generation, but this ""me"" leads him to kill. It is only he that matters. But I am puzzled with what led him to be that way. I prefer films that at least make some effort to discuss how a character came to be; rather than just placing an artificial construct in front of the film and expecting us to sympathize. The movie isn't bad per se, but you get the sense that the main character is there just to shock...ZooTrouble",American Psycho
527,gainestillinger,Barry Norman knows nothing.,9,1 November 2009,"Barry Norman once said that playing Patrick Bateman, a rich twenty-seven year old Wall Street nutjob, could very well have been 'suicide' for Christian Bale. Ha! What did he know? American Psycho is a dissection of the modern executive man syndrome, but set in the eighties with Gordan Gecko haircuts, Charlie Sheen all-night benders, sharp suits, bags of drugs and enough sexism to give Germaine Greer a stroke. It is Wall Street but without the building tension of a plot. Instead, all we are left with is a character piece that expresses itself through Bateman's narrations on how he is not really here, that he feels nothing but 'disgust' and 'greed' and how he knows not why his nightime murder sprees are becoming more violent and horrific.Throughout this film we are, as is Bateman, clueless as to why he feels the need to slay beautiful women and fellow yuppies; why he sweats through his Valentino couture suits when a colleague produces a more tasteful business card than his own (Batemen later butchers the said colleague with an axe to the face); and why he feels the need to put a nail gun to the head of his unsuspecting secretary whilst having a quiet drink at his quite expensive apartment. As it progresses we get the sense that this film is not going to peak in a 'Seven' type ending, but that instead it is a wandering exploration of how enough money leads to illusions of grandeur and the belief that you can do just about anything you want; that it is a conceptual piece and the nada-plot and subsequent uber-violence are products of that concept. We are left with an idea and the realisation that Bateman probably isn't there at all, that he is just one of a million like him that can't see past the end of their thousand dollar Mont Blanc fountain pen and ten grand oyster movement Rolex submariner.This film launched Bale's career in a way that many other films could not. It was daring, controversial and ultimately a gamble. It's a shame that other actors do not take this kind of risk... and that Bale went on to make Terminator Salvation. That's another review though. Still, if Barry Norman thought that this film could have gone one way or the other: how did it go the one way? Well, aside from the stuff already mentioned, the film is a broad mixture of amazing set pieces, costumes that make tailors salivate and very black humour. Bateman ends up with an almost catch phrase line 'I've got to return some videotapes' which he repeats several times in the film instead of, say, strangling his homosexual colleague in the toilets of an expensive boys' club, or as a parting line in a brutal public break up with his fiancé.The thing that struck me about this film is that despite the story's focus on violence toward women, it was in fact directed by a woman, Mary Harron. Perhaps this is where the film works. If it had been directed by a man the focus may have been solely anti-woman, rather than the humour, the style of the time and the concept of this finished product.",American Psycho
528,flying-monkeys,Still Undecided...,7,8 September 2002,"It's been about a year since I watched this film and I still don't know what to think of it. When I picked it out at the video store, I did so strictly because it was depicted as a horror/suspense film (which I love) and it had Christian Bale in it (who I liked as an actor even though the only movie I'd seen him in was Little Women). Maybe it was the fact that I was going into this movie with visions of Laurie (Bale's character in Little Women) still in my head or that I had absolutely no idea what the plot was but I was stunned to say the least.My family and I (all adults) sat down to watch MY big selection (which they all made sure to point out after we were done watching, and actually only my sister and myself made it all the way through it the parents evacuated not long after the first gory scene), and needless to say we were all shocked at what we were watching. My mouth literally dropped open and stayed that way until the end. I didn't know how to feel after I viewed all the cold-blooded gruesome murder scenes followed by Bateman's even colder reactions to them. Yes, the humorous actions like talking about music choice was quite funny but I was bracing myself for whatever was to come next, after all I really had no idea. It was a very realistic performance from Bale, which has now forever changed my visual image of him as an actor. I had no idea he had such range, such talent. I will forever be a fan. He really was Bateman, I got chills just watching this character, listening to him speak. But I never really felt a connection to any of the characters. They were all so materialistic and selfish it was hard to feel empathy for them.Perhaps, one day I will brave viewing it again so I can really gauge the overall movie but for now I'm content with knowing I've seen it. The main thing I remember when I think about ""American Psycho"" is man, Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman was one scary SOB. Maybe I'll read the book first then watch the movie. This film definitely takes you outside the typical movie goer comfort zone so be prepared for anything. I would rate Christian Bale's performance a 10/10 but for the movie (until I can see it again) I would give it a 5/10.",American Psycho
529,kaspen12,"Worth seeing, if only for the post-viewing discussions",8,19 March 2006,"Starring: Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Chloë Sevigny, Reese WitherspoonIn 1991, Bret Easton Ellis released his third novel, American Psycho, to a chorus of poor reviews and public uproar. It was a controversial work making a perverse assessment on the state of its times (the late 80s). Its initial publisher, Simon & Schuster, dropped the book just a month before its slated release date. The National Organization of Women threatened to file obscenity lawsuits against the novel, and boycott bookstores carrying it. Ellis's own life was threatened on several occasions. What is surprising then is that it took nearly ten years for it to become a feature film. Even more surprising, that it would eventually be adapted by two women.That said, Mary Herron, directing from a script she co-wrote with Guinevere Turner, turns in a memorably tense film. From the very first frames of the opening credits, Harron creates great tension as raspberry sauce decorates a dessert, splattering like blood on the white of the plate. Immediately, the tone is set for what's to come.Patrick Bateman (Bale) is living the American Dream. Or...he should be. He works a high-paying Wall Street job, lives in a pricey uptown apartment, is engaged to a beautiful fiancée (Witherspoon), and is banging her best friend (Samantha Mathis) on the side. The problem? His life is completely empty and soulless. ""I have all the characteristics of a human being,"" he tells us in voice-over, ""but not a single clear, identifiable emotion."" His co-workers think him a loser, and tell him so to his face -- so forgettable is he, they don't even know they're talking to him. One such co-worker, Paul Allen (Jared Leto) leads a remarkably similar life to Bateman's. The difference is, Allen lives it better. His apartment is nicer, the cases he handles are bigger, his fake ""Vice President"" business card is glossier. Not to be outdone, Bateman, a man who strives for perfection and power, lashes out at Allen -- not with words, but with an axe to the face. Allen's ""sudden disappearance"" draws the attention of a private detective (a scene-stealing Dafoe), while Bateman's thirst for bloody mayhem becomes insatiable.The film holds secrets which I wouldn't dare spoil, and its ending leaves them very open to interpretation. It sticks with you, its ambiguity begging for mental closure. This is a movie worth seeing, for even if you don't like it, there is much left to be discussed.FINAL SCORE: 8.7 = A- It seems ironic that Bale would move from Bateman to Batman -- worlds apart, they are held separate by only one letter. Still, Bateman is such an interesting character. Here is a man whose television blares porn as he goes about his business, and slasher flicks as he exercises; who pontificates on the musical strengths of Phil Collins and Huey Lewis while committing brutal murder. Such is the nature of the film: shock and horror, with a side of black comedy. Bale delivers a remarkable performance, and Harron, a brutally mesmerizing masterpiece. I found myself watching much of the film with wide eyes and a hand on my face. Still, I could never quite look away.",American Psycho

532,aztecp,"Great career move, Christian Bale!",8,15 April 2000,"I can't get the guy out of my head!  The performance is chilling and extraordinary. DiCaprio should be kicking himself for not taking this role. Director Mary Harron has treated the very questionable material by Bret Easton Ellis much better than it deserves.  She understands that leaving things to our imaginations is much more powerful than actually showing them and the violence in the movie is doubly disturbing precisely because of that. Is it me or it seems that lately women directors like Harron and Kimberley Pierce from ""Boys Don't Cry"" are bringing much more cojones to movies than the rest of the Hollywood gang?  Their movies are streamlined, intelligent, unsentimental, and very well directed.  They are kicking male butt. You go, girls!  For one, I think Boys Don't Cry was a much better movie than any of the Oscar contenders this year. As for the eighties portrayed in American Psycho, they are suspiciously similar to the nineties and so far to the zeros as well.  Insane obsessions with brands and logos, crazy food, restaurant madnesses and a total disregard for anything but money and greed. Ignorant yuppies ruling the world. Sound familiar? American Psycho could have taken place in New York today.  The only difference is that instead of Huey Lewis, Patrick Bateman would be deconstructing Britney Spears.",American Psycho
533,tranquil,Wonderfully surreal,8,3 March 2001,"[possible minor spoilers]
American Psycho brilliantly distinguishes itself from many other immature, horror hack-n-slash flicks that have plagued the decade.  The tone of the movie is quite calm, giving the movie an adult, deeper level of atmosphere. The movie is in first person narrative, quite an odd, yet refreshing view of a serial killer and his motives and thoughts.  From the first moments, the audience is led into the very personal life of Bateman, our psycho.  His rigorous personal lifestyle and painfully sequenced daily procedures speak of a different incarnation than the cleancut facade of a wall streeter. Darker deeds and reflections surface as the movie proceeds.The dreamlike atmosphere is greatly heightened by Bateman's numerous, intimate appraisals of music and the correspondingly cold, logical analysises of its chronology.  Bateman speaks like a professor.  His words are ever calm, and flows outward without hesitation or barriers.  Such relaxed and intelligent demeanor is hardly what one would expect in a psycho, yet this is Bateman's greatest triumph, his double life.As all the events are set in motion, the movie rolls faster and faster toward the end.  Bateman eventually loses control of his tenuous sanity and goes postal.  Then the ending comes and, after seeing half the credits roll off the screen, you realize what really happened, and then begin to comprehend the bitter-sweet anticlimax.Well worth the time and price.",American Psycho
534,minnie_mie,"Dark, witty and BRILLIANT!",8,3 April 2002,"*SPOILERS*I've been reading other comments on American Psycho, and it seems as if there are a lot of people disagreeing about stuff. Well, I think that's just what the director wanted - to create a film that people would remember, discuss, debate, whether or not they liked it, and that's what we've all been doing! I don't think it was made for people to ""like"", more to give insight and provoke. But anyways, I really liked it. There's something really funny about a well to do guy saying lines like, ""I like to dissect girls, did you know I'm utterly insane?"" right in front of peoples faces. Little do they know.... The plot is almost non-existent, and to be honest, I didn't really care about it. There's more to this movie than that, I just found it really interesting watching Patrick's life roll by and the wierd way he lives it. I guess you have to have a certain amount of intelligence and open-mindedness to get a film like this. I like to think that Bateman actaully did kill all those people...and the b**tard got away with it, just cause he did. Cause no one ever suspected him or whatever, it's a better ending than, ""it was all in his head."" The film is quite disturbing with the explicit sex scenes and violence (actually, although I am naturally squemish, I didn't think there wasn't as much gore as everyone made out to be), but it's sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. Like the part where Bateman's with the two prostitutes and he's going into detail about PHIL COLLINS of all people, and at the same time instructing the women into positions. Or when we see just the utter madness of him when he gets totally manic over a fellow collegue having a better business card. There's something appealing about Bateman, even though he's a pretentious prick who is obsessed with vanity, sex and murder.Special praise for Christian Bale, he is not only one fine looking actor, but his mannerisms and facial expressions give Bateman that supressed madness look. 10/10 for a wicked film. Check out the scene where he's about to axe Paul Allen, his prancing about to the music is hilarious.",American Psycho
535,TrickyTheHorrorFreak,Fantastic performance by Christian Bale brings a disturbing character to life.,8,17 September 2006,"""An American Psycho"" is one of those films that people seem to find very difficult to come to grips with. Is it a masterpiece deserving of praise? Is it a completely boring, insensitive piece of sick trash? Or is it something in between? Through all this argument though, there is one thing that cannot be denied. That this film will provoke a reaction from the viewer whether it is feelings of disgust, praise, amusement, unease or all of the above. Well, unless of course the viewer is in a similar state of mind as Patrick Bateman that is.You see, Patrick Bateman externally appears to be everything a man could want to be. He has a body to die for, a big earning job and all the worldly possessions that come with the territory. Yet despite all this, Patrick finds it difficult to feel anything. He states in the film that he feels no human emotions other than ""greed and disgust"" and it's this complete lack of connection with the world that drives him to violence. However, even these extreme outbursts of gruesome bloodshed still can't make him feel anything but empty and only distance him further from humanity, driving him towards madness.Christian Bale's performance as Patrick is simply stunning. He fills the character with humour, anger, charm, intelligence and copious amounts of vanity. Christian makes even the strangest of scenarios in Patrick's existence appear to be completely realistic for him. An example of such bizarre behaviour is the way he verbally critiques Huey Lewis and the News while murdering a colleague. Or when he decides another colleague should die for the simple fact that they now have a better business card than he does. These occurrences are as funny as they are unsettling but never unintentionally so. The direction is perfectly understated and considering the extreme nature of the book it is based on, the screenplay is as loyal as decency (amongst the general movie going population anyway) and budget would allow. I should point out though that I have not yet read the book and this review is based only on the movie itself and not the quality of the adaptation.""An American Psycho"" is not for the faint of heart and yet there essentially isn't all that much on-screen gore. Not to say that killing people with chainsaws and axes isn't gory, only that these brutal acts of slaughter are mostly either only suggested or just out of the cameras view. But more than the acts themselves, many viewers will find the nonchalant, motiveless way in which Patrick conducts them far more disturbing, not to mention his degrading use of women as self gratifying objects.I thoroughly enjoy this movie. Despite all the disconcerting aspects of the story it remains an entertaining film and multiple viewings have definitely been rewarding. The only way in which I feel this film is not a complete success is in the ambiguousness of its final moments. Although it certainly makes a great discussion point post viewing, I can't help but feel it to be frustrating and slightly unnecessary. I have my views on what it all means, but I won't mention them here as I don't want to ruin things for those that haven't seen the movie yet. Besides, I have to return some video tapes.",American Psycho

This is a review in disregarding that specifics from the book were left out which would have been fun to see on screen but I understand that it may not have been possible.Now this Movie as it is an incredible masterpiece, Patrick Bateman is a corner stone in Psycho's for movies after this movie, and due to that was because Christian Bale played that role to perfection! We have all come see what an incredible Actor Bale has become, he is a true method actor with every stretch of the word, he goes to the extreme to fulfill his roles in any movie he is in and this was no exception. This captures the insanity of a successful business man in the late 80's who has to put on a face for civilian life but behind closed doors he is a sociopath psychopath that has to feed on his murderous thirst of human life.As stated earlier many things from the book were not put in however the movie is still a magnificent piece of art and Mary Harron did a great job with it, it is a shame she directs such few movies over her career I would love to watch more ""true"" films by her instead of all those television shows.This has reached incredible plateau with everything it has achieved, and Patrick Bateman's character is something many have come to mimic the way he was created for film. This movie has also become a strong point of conversation piece due to the script writing which was phenomenal, next time reading something related to this film see how many references you can catch that come back to this film.10/10 ~XTC Ps. do you mind?

It is the most quotable film I have ever seen and Christian Bale's Bateman is probably one of the best acted film villains I have ever seen in cinema. Christian Bale is so totally underrated for the talent he has and displays in every single film he is in, I would say even starting with his role in Empire of the Sun, to American Psycho, to The Machinist, that he has set himself up to be a great character actor. Besides his stellar performance in this film, everyone else I think does an excellent job as well, and the translation from Ellis' novel to the script by Turner and Harron give this film a satirical feminist edge that really subverts '80's pop culture and reganomics. Greed is the creed here, and Bateman is the product of such a heartless society. Perfect film.",American Psycho

Harron's direction is very impressive as she manages to take the story through the narrow route that blurs the line between fiction and reality with great finesse. American Psycho is a fascinating vignette of lunacy and obsession as it intriguingly blends its elements of horror and dark comedy into an exquisitely paced, masterfully directed and magnificently written story that delves into the mind and psyche of its incredibly deranged individual with plenty of success, and remains one of the finest achievements of its genre(s) and of the greatest movies of the 2000s.",American Psycho

543,naysbaghai,Unearthly brutal and outright confronting,9,12 December 2015,"2000 is commonly regarded as one of the best years in cinema, but none of the films that year were as unearthly brutal and outright confronting as the hybrid opus American Psycho. Predominantly constructed as a psychological thriller, this film should rank high on anyone's ""most disturbing"" film list, but as a reviewer, my catharsis from such unsettling sights was the breadth in technique and execution.The opening credits exhibit what separates good opening titles from great ones, and that is the usage of foreshadowing. Everything, from the exquisite dishes to the slashing knife, and even the elegant font, is representative of the future events in the film. As an adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel, the poetic passages and smooth dialogue are effortlessly translated onto film, further signifying Mary Hellon's subtlety and neutrality in her direction. Her clinical style of direction is particularly showcased when she edits Detective Kimball's interview scene from various performance takes to deliberately confuse audiences in regards to Kimball's thoughts.The film boasts an impressive ensemble cast featuring Willem Defoe, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon and Justin Theroux. As talented as all the actors in the film are, none hold up to the irrepressible Christian Bale, whose penchant for method acting is in full blossom. By spending hours in the gym and maintaining an American accent, he truly does morph into the role of a truly twisted and sick son of a bitch. He is flanked by symbols such as cigars, expensive materials and facial masks, highlighting the film's smart investigation into the hedonistic upper class. American Psycho is undoubtedly objective and cold, and forces the audience to decide on their own personal views of the human world.A large percentage of the film's budget is devoted to a soundtrack full of classic 80s hits, like Walking On Sunshine, Simply Irresistible and Lady In Red. Ultimately, the most iconic usage of music in this film is when Hip To Be Square, by Huey Lewis and the News, is cranked up as Bateman viciously murders Paul Allen with a fire axe. As a film addict, I realised how the sign of a good movie is when it synchronises a famous piece of music to the scene, and perpetually associates the two in your synapses. Speaking of which, Bateman's behaviour and violence is enormously disturbing, and is the primary reason why American Psycho is really only for adults. I learned that a sign of adulthood is not the tolerance of an R18+ movie, but rather the bravery to object to senseless violence. It's hard not to be enticed by the techniques and performances, but if you find yourself undisturbed by the content of this film, then, to quote Reese Witherspoon's character, ""you're inhuman"".",American Psycho

Both actors are handsome, Leonardo DiCaprio could probably still made those fashion remarks with enough affectation and act elegantly, but Bale was somehow darker and more sinister, perhaps a real reflection of his life?",American Psycho
545,JakersWild,Psycho alone isn't all that,2,15 January 2001,"The first five minutes of this movie summarise 90% of it. A bunch of people talking pointlessly about nothing special. The worst were the commentaries on 80's music during supposedly key scenes. Christian Bale does a fine acting job with the material he is given, and if you enjoy an actor doing the best with weak material, particularly when he has a well-maintained body that is shown off a fair amount, there may still be something to look for here. Put him in a suit and have him yammer endlessly and I'd confuse him with other faceless drones just like some in the movie do.But this movie really isn't all that, it isn't that shocking or disturbing, and we never even really get to know any of the characters... especially the lead. Frankly I know more interestingly psychotic people in my everyday life, though as far as I know none of them have killed. The most interesting person in the movie to me was the guy's assistant, and halfway through the movie discovered I'd much rather hear her story.I've heard some say they don't like how this movie ended. I liked the ending just fine: The credits rolled, I put my hands in the air and said 'Thank God it's over!' and turned it off. Not the worst movie I've seen I'm sure, but seemingly the longest 1:43 minute movie ever. Maybe if Mr. Bale had shown off his well-sculpted form throughout the whole feature it would have been worth a few more stars.It does bug me though -- why do so many directors think that mental illness and having a character exercising in the nude go so well together? At least a half-dozen movies right off have used that connection. So you out there, if you've recently found yourself doing your morning stretches in the nude, get some therapy before its too late!!! :-)",American Psycho

By the time it was over, it had fallen to six, but we both thought that the film was, as a whole, a masterpiece.  Yesterday, I rented it for the first time (since no one else will ever check it out) and watched it with another of my friends.  Once again, totally blown away.This IS indeed among the most underrated films to come out.  It's got an amazing cast, amazing acting by the cast, and beautiful locations.  On the other hand, it's one of the most gratuitous movies I've ever seen.  Doesn't bother me in any way, but it's very easy to see why the Oscar committee might run and hide.  One look at the threesome sex scene, and they were hiding under their seats.The true beauty of this film comes out in the acting of Christian Bale, a virtual unknown.  True, he had held a bit part in ""Pocahontas"" and the role of that kid Jack in ""Newsies"", but I doubt he'd want us to talk about that. The role of the psychotic, yet well organized Patrick Bateman came almost immediately after him being in a role as far to the other side of the spectrum as possible...Jesus.  His incredible breadth is shown throughout such tense scenes as the business card showdown, the hilarious phone message (""I just had to kill a lot of people!""), and the disturbingly funny murder of Paul Allen, done to a personal review of Huey Lewis and the News.The one problem, the very ending.  This second time, I figured out what was really going on, but it took me a damn long time.  I'll probably end up watching it again today...just to make sure I was completely right.

With so many metaphors and imagery, the films become almost impressionistic in that viewers interpret the meaning so differently.	""American Psycho"" fits the description well. The movie is so heavily dosed with abnormal scenes, viewers have to decide for themselves the message being sent.	Christian Bale plays a successful businessman in the 1980s with an insatiable appetite for killing. The movie is more of a confession than it is a story, with Bale's character becoming more insane with each passing scene.	""American Psycho"" is a bit like ""American Beauty"" in its overwhelming artistic endeavors. What ""American Beauty"" did for suburbia in the 1990s, ""American Psycho"" tries to do for yuppie life in the 1980s. Both try to act as examples of what actually happens behind the facades of those who are rich and successful.	The movie also has a pretty remarkable, although underused, cast. Reese Witherspoon, Chloë Sevigny (nominated for an Oscar in ""Boys Don't Cry"") and Willem Dafoe all make appearances in the film, but really not much more than that.	However, Bale is spectacular as both a stuck-up yuppie and a psychopathic killer. What makes his performance - and the movie, for that matter - so disturbing is how believable Bale is at playing both parts at the same time, as well as being able to make the transition from one character to another.	Another disturbing element of the film is the haunting mixture of comedy with horror. One of the most amusing scenes in the film shows Bale's character becoming angry because of the impressive embossing of his co-workers' business cards. It's humorous, yes, but sickening when combined with the fact that he plans on killing one of the men because of the business card.	In spite of some troubling scenes in the film, ""American Psycho"" still has the ability to be a rewarding film for viewers.

He likes and does all the typical things Wall Street people do: parties, drugs, living in posh apartments and so on. However, as the title suggests, Bateman has another thing he likes to do: he is a psychopathic murderer. This satirical black comedy demonstrates some of the realities of the modern Wall Street-based society. Although it is not clear if the author of the novel intends it (not having read the novel), the story could be interpreted as a story of Wall Street executives literally getting away with murder. It may not be that the Wall Street executives are particularly ""evil"" people themselves, but because of their class position, the executives wield enormous amounts of power and privilege. Thus, it is very instructive when Bateman finds out that nobody wants to believe his confessions of a uber-privileged executive being a serial killer on the side. Also, the behavior of law enforcement when it confronts him is markedly different with all deference being offered to him as a mark of his exalted position and in the end, it is not clear if law enforcement would ever be interested in having justice served to him, but it is clear from one of the last scenes, where he shows his own incredulity at his lawyer laughing off his sordid confessions, that Bateman ironically realizes his own hyper-privileged position pretty much absolves him of any crimes of mass murder he may want to continue to commit.",American Psycho
553,mrbusyb,"As I was afraid to laugh, this movie is a dark comedy",8,12 May 2011,"I give this movie an 8 because it flows along from beginning to end in absurd Hunter S. Thompson like fashion much like the movies ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and ""Crank."" So, it isn't an original. About the segment of society that is cool-as-a-cucumber and sophisticated, ""American Psycho"" is ""The Matrix"" with color added. The antagonist bad guy in this movie is not an an individual but more of an abstract expressing how a lone psychopathic killer can go unnoticed in a sociopathic business world. Christian Bale plays the part of vice president Patrick Bateman. Patrick Bateman plays the part of me, myself and I which Freud commonly referred to as the ""It"" (id) character to the ego and the superego. It loves himself. It only thinks about himself. It wants the best business card. It humps and pumps faceless women while cherishing and filming himself. It wants to be able to call a restaurant and get an immediate reservation. When It doesn't get what he wants, he kills out in the open any time and any where. There is certainly a lot to explore in the depths of this disturbing dark comedy. Perhaps the reason this movie is so puzzling to many is because it accurately portrays society for what it is. While those on top of the world like to think of themselves as above nature, they are in fact the top predators in it.",American Psycho
554,Style_is_Substance,Underwhelming and Basic,5,26 June 2016,"A film like American Psycho is one that attracts a certain type of person. Its primary fan base is youthful people with high adrenaline and desire to watch entertaining violence while also longing for more meaning that is easy and accessible to them. The meaning this type of people long for doesn't even have to be of much substance, as long as these viewers are able to understand it and justify their taste with a comment on the lines of ""no, it is good because it is satirizing violence, not condoning it"" even though there is a good chance this type of person also just enjoys this type of content already, rendering the satire aspect useless for the person's argument. I don't think American Psycho is a particularly bad film, but I don't think it is a particularly good film. I believe this film relies too much on entertaining violence and its satire is rather flat. One should make close attention to Bale's role as Patrick Bateman. Bateman is rather a caricature, or at least his character is fairly static. However, while one could look at that as a negative, it isn't necessarily bad. The superficiality and lack of (for the most part) real dimension of the protagonist character can be argued to benefit from the notion that such people in his position of power themselves take on a public persona that in turn becomes who they are. Adopting said persona in this position could lead the individual to lack normal emotional and mental depth. Patrick Bateman as a character has little depth, and because of this, he fills the empty hole with the satisfaction of fulfilling hedonistic fantasies including misogyny and murder. The film opens with a scene of Bateman narrating about who he is as an individual, practically noting how superficial and empty he really is. To further the point, they have him applying a materialistic skin mask to develop who our protagonist is. Now, this is what the film sets up and has working for it. Unfortunately, as the film progresses, I feel the film focuses on the entertainment aspect of murder and misogyny (which admittedly is good in some scenes) up to the point that it overshadows satire and leaves it somewhat undeveloped. I feel that American Psycho does not live up to what it sets up leading to a rather underwhelming and predictable climax. At least it was to me.With this in mind some may wonder why certain people flock to defend the film? The answer is that it fits a formula and adopts tropes that some impressionable people like. Such tropes include insane serial killer protagonist, violent and sexual scenes played comically and set to popular music, and of course surface level satire to make the viewer feel smart for noticing and not guilty for enjoying the violence and sex. The film has its moments to shine, but ultimately falls flat. Not the worst, but far from the best.I expect just solely due to my lukewarm rating and negative title, there will be fans who will mark this review as ""unhelpful."" Well, maybe not as much now that I addressed this.",American Psycho

556,floatmyboat,Darkly satirical social commentary,8,9 February 2007,"American Psycho is a dark, blood-soaked chunk of satire about a hideous beast that isn't as uncommon as we think. As what we wear and where we eat start taking priority over what we do and how we do it, this monster could very well be any of us. Based on the 1991 novel by the same name, this is neither a horror nor a slasher film. The caricatures and allegories give an entirely other-worldly feel to what otherwise seems like regular, recognizable settings.This is the story of Patrick Bateman (the buff and often butt-naked Christian Bale), who is the epitome of a yuppie. He knows which exfoliating creams his face needs and which water-proof bath gel works best for him. He does a thousand crunches a day and gets himself artificial tanning and regular manicures. With this level of self-love, comes an overpowering sense of narcissism and the insatiable desire to get attention. Obsessively name-dropping, sporting the most desirable brands, and being seen at some of the most exclusive places is most of what Bateman and his ilk do. As the life of conspicuous consumption carries on, we see his conversations becoming trite, relationships losing any meaning, and quick ways of getting high taking precedence. Most of Patrick Bateman's social interaction are shown as awkward and understandably so, as a person as self-involved as him will not be able to carry on a normal conversation with anyone.Things slowly start getting out of hand as his craving for attention turns into uber-competitiveness that turns lethal for those involved. The hunger for highs, the callousness from having all luxuries one can ask for, and a lack of purpose push Bateman into a darker world where he prowls the night soliciting prostitutes and potential slashing victims. Things slowly take a turn for the fantastic as ATMs start demanding feline offerings and random people getting shot by the dozen. After a certain point, it doesn't even matter whether these things happened. And it is at this level where the film works its magic.There is a distinct quality of surrealism throughout the film. In this topsy-turvy world, people talk in a strange tongue and give importance to the oddest things. The symbolic and satirical tone of the film works perfectly, and it seems like there wasn't another way that would have worked. The extremes shown in the film do efficiently what a more direct way couldn't have. This is certainly not one of the easiest films to watch or appreciate. But to say that it serves only to shock you would be doing disservice to it. It doesn't preach and instead shows us the despicable psychopath that lives in a small corner within all of us.",American Psycho

558,vetmad,where's the story?,1,27 May 2000,"Okay, I admit it, I didn't plan to see this movie in a theater, but it happened that I had to see it in a sneak-preview, so... this film was absolutely meaningless to me, without a decent story and without a real good actor, and I mean actor; Reese Witherspoon is always wonderful to watch. You have this successful guy with money, a nice girlfriend, lots of friends and lots of pressure he can't bear and for compensation he just walks around, killing homeless people, prostitutes and friends. This was the one movie in a long time I was really upset about; don't get me wrong, I love films like the Scream-Trilogy or The Matrix, films with a lot of blood and violence, but ""American Psycho"" uses violence only for the sake of violence itself, to satisfy the audience's voyeuristic bloodlust. And, who would really believe one could shot a couple of policemen, an old lady and several other people in one night without further notice? Sounds more like some kind of tasteless comedy than a movie that wants to be taken seriously.",American Psycho

Total unrealistic portrayal of doing what goes inside the mind of rich cynical yuppies of 80's. I have never read the novel written by Brett Easton Ellis. Based on his story, the film is worth of praise. Every line is iconic. Christian Bale does a great job here displaying the highs and lows of manic insanity. His interaction with other characters is very entertaining. There is nothing realistic nor serious here. So please this is a sarcastic, dark, twisted comedy. The mind bender in the end is also very intriguing. Makes you question what really took place here.
Some scenes are very strong and are sexual, physical and abusive in nature. Nevertheless this is timeless and the range of Mr. Bale's acting is impressive.",American Psycho

561,DanPacino,Some people just don't get it. I do!,10,13 February 2002,"(Possible Spoilers ahead)Listen Up because I,m not going to say this again. American Psycho is not a Horror Film - It is a satirical and Psychological thriller filled with sickly funny dark comedy.Christian Bale is absolutly amazing in this film. He should have won some kind of 'Best Actor' award for his performance as the 'Psycho' Patrick Bateman. Willem DeFoe, Jared Leto and Chloe Sevigny also play their roles to a good standard.The biggest complaint that I have read concerning this great film is that some people think ""The ending sucked coz it was too confusing"". It was NOT too confusing. I admit that the twist in the end of the movie is perhaps a little more complex than the twists at the ends of 'The Sixth Sense' or 'Fight Club' but come on people, that was the whole friggin point. Bateman is a 'Psycho', in a very big way. But he did NOT kill anyone... Or did he?. That is the point! The story is a narrative as he see's things. He is confused - he does not know if he killed anyone or not therefore we, the viewers, having lived in his mind, do not know either.

562,rockian,This is a masterpiece?,1,16 July 2001,"How anyone can categorize this film as a masterpiece amazes me.  There was a perfect opportunity to develop a possible thrilling confrontation of Willem Dafoe's character and Patrick Batemen.  Yet, Dafoe's character disappears.I watched this piece of garbage twice to see if I could figure out the ending.  I'm embarrassed that I wasted this time trying to put some sort of meaning to such a lame film.  Just because the film makes fun of the self-centeredness of the '80s doesn't mean this is a good film.What is more disturbing than the thought that someone would think this would be an interesting film is that someone thinks there should be a sequel!I give this a -10 out of 10.

Can someone explain that? When he goes into that other guy's apartment and it's for sale and totally scrubbed clean? I didn't get this dialog between Bateman and the real estate lady or why there weren't cops and police tape all over the crime scene...What am I missing there? As far as his lawyer calling him Davis and saying that he had seen the dead man recently in London, that was funny and when the whole thing clicked for me, but I am still wondering what the heck was up with that apartment scene. I know there are comic and surrealism elements of the story, but they mostly made sense in within the context of the plot.",American Psycho
564,quis89,Unsettling to say the least,7,15 March 2011,"So much could be, and probably has been, said about this film. It's obviously a commentary on modern society, but it's also a look into one man's psyche. You will come to realize by the end of the film that everything you are seeing is through the almost certainly unreliable point of view of Patrick as he begins to come unhinged.I want to talk about the end of the film though, because I think it's what will upset viewers of this movie. Throughout the film for the most part, you accept that Patrick is a serial killer. After all, he tells you he is - he takes bloody sheets to the dry cleaner, stabs a homeless man, chops up his coworker. As viewers of films we've been trained to accept what we see as fact. But in the end actions become increasingly more absurd and unrealistic, culminating in a final scene where an ATM tells Bateman to feed it a stray cat, and he goes on a much too over the top shooting rampage. We cannot accept that what we are seeing is actually happening.I think this is what is so great, yet so annoying, about this movie. There is no catharsis, no resolution, no ""A Beautiful Mind"" moment where we or Bateman finally know for sure what's real and what's not. We're brought to the moment of climax but we don't get the resolution, so we're left feeling frustrated, so to speak. But that's what's so great about it too, because it forces you to think about it, consider it. Unlike so many Hollywood blockbusters that spoonfeed you tripe to gaze at blankly for an hour and a half, American Psycho engages your mind.The movie is flawed. It's hard for me to put my finger on it exactly, but it's a multitude of little things that alternately alienate and bore the audience, mixed in with many brilliant scenes. It's hard for me to say if this story could've been done better, never having read the novel, but it's hard to pull off this kind of subjective reality on film. But American Psycho is certainly worth watching.",American Psycho
565,katyggls,American Psycho; Great Film With A Lot To Say,9,5 July 2005,"I highly recommend it. The movie is based on the controversial 1991 novel by Bret Easton Ellis.The film stars Christian Bale (Little Women, Batman Begins) as Patrick Bateman, a young, handsome, affluent executive in late 1980's New York City. He seems to have it all, cushy job, pretty fiancé (Reese Witherspoon), posh apartment, powerful friends. What he doesn't have is a soul. As he says in the beginning of the film, ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there."" Patrick is a serial killer (or is he? watch the film, what do you think?). The film graphically portrays his nightly homicidal habits, without becoming too slasher flick about it. This film isn't for the faint at heart, besides blood and gore, there are some pretty graphic sexual encounters and nudity. But there is comedy here as well. You'll find yourself laughing at some sequences and feeling terribly guilty about it. The next moment you're wincing at it's raw violence.If Patrick is the hyper prototype of the 80's yuppie male, then his friends are more realistic reflections of it. In one scene, he and his friends are discussing women. One of his friends asserts that the ideal woman ""consists of a chick with a little hard body, who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things, and who essentially will keep her dumb f***ing mouth shut"". In another scene, he and his friends are discussing some of the world's problems. When Patrick lists some of the ills that society needs to solve (he doesn't really care, he just wants to be seen as knowledgeable), his friends are amused. The people around him in this yuppie society are obsessed with surfaces. They keep all of their real thoughts, concerns, and emotions buried, and only care about what people wear, drive, own, and buy. For this reason, Patrick, who actually has no inner emotions, is able to move undetected among them.The film is an exposition of the morally bankrupt 1980's male dominated corporate culture. But this theme is still relevant today. Our culture idealizes the macho, ruthless businessman who treats women as objects and possessions. In a scene of the movie, Patrick tells a woman that he later murders that he's into ""murders and executions"" and she mishears him, thinking he said, ""mergers and acquisitions""; it really comes to the same thing. It is these same men who are now running corporate America. Is it any wonder that corporations seem to feel so little responsibility to their employees, stockholders, the public, the environment, the law, or virtually anything at all? Indeed, Patrick's broad choice of victims in the film (even more in the book) mirror those who are often victimized by corporate America. Women, the poor, the homeless, minorities, the elderly, even animals.Overall, this is a great film with superb acting by Christian Bale and a few others, including Chloe Sevigny who plays Jean, Patrick's secretary. The end is perplexing and will cause you to watch the entire movie again to see if you can figure it out.",American Psycho
566,codchops,"Don't just stare at it, eat it!!!",10,14 June 2009,"So often films fail to live up to the books that preceded them, American Psycho however is a masterpiece in its own right. I absolutely loved the book but I feel that the book and the movie have a totally different feel to them and both are exceptional works of art.This is one of my favourite movies of all time and definitely in my top 5. Bale gives a faultless performance and gets so involved in his character that, given the character, it is quite worrying! The way he plays the suave perfectionist and goes off on rants about Phil Collins and Whitney Houston is masterful.The movie is shot superbly and the 80's theme is well executed from the hang out locations and clothing worn by the characters, right down to the hairstyles. The sound track is excellent too.I personally see this movie as a black comedy and I laugh out loud at many parts on every viewing.What is also great about this movie is that you can have your own take on the meaning. Does Patrick actually commit all of the deaths but the Wall Street yuppies are so stereotyped that no one even notices that people are missing? Or is the killing spree all in his imagination?This is definitely a movie which keeps you full of thought long after the credits roll. Some may look at the title and immediately write it off as a slasher movie. Don't be fooled. There are some scenes which may not be to all tastes but this movie can be classed as a black comedy or 80's Wall Street biopic horror!Do you like Huey Lewis & the News?A masterpiece. 10/10.",American Psycho

569,MrKearns-2,"Well, the poster's cool.",3,18 April 2000,"The poster for American Psycho is incredible. The film, on the other hand, is so pointless it's almost difficult to sum up.There are certainly many people who will enjoy this movie, assuming there are a large number of serial killers in the world. Because, frankly, unless you find brutal murder funny, there's not much redeeming about this movie.From the opening, we meet Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). He's well-dressed, has perfect hair, and a penchant for brutally murdering people. This brings us to our first flaw. Director Mary Harron would like you to believe that he's a nice normal guy and then really shock you with that first murder scene. In fact, I was hoping for someone to get killed just so we could get on with her pithy little movie.Every character in this movie is simply uninteresting. Reese Witherspoon appears at Patrick's girlfriend, and phones in her performance. Chloe Sevigny is superfluous as Patrick's secretary, and Jared Leto is simply in the movie because he sort of looks like Christian Bale.Bale, on the other hand, does a good job of making me hate his character. Then again, he doesn't do it correctly. I hate this guy not because he kills people, but because he isn't believable. He reeks of phoniness 24/7, and the entire film, we watch as Bale tries to hide his grin, as if he's saying ""mommy, I'm naughty"".So, while the audience sits there, Bale kills lots of people, and apparently it's funny. The audience who previewed this with me was roaring, as if this was some masterwork of Groucho Marx (who probably could have done a better chainsaw gag if given the chance).Perhaps the most awful thing about this movie is that it tries to be so witty, when in fact, it's just stupid. Before he kills his victims, Patrick talks about 80s music, that is simply stuck on the soundtrack to make us think it's the 80s, as if it mattered. This is a wonderful date movie, if you're dating Ted Bundy, or if your idea of a fun evening is Robert Palmer and Huey Lewis intermixed with brutal murder.I give this movie 1 star out of 5. A bad screenplay, and a talented, but wasted cast leave this Psycho in solitary.",American Psycho
570,jack_1981,"Fantastic, engaging, brilliant, superb...",10,23 February 2001,"Well, well, well is this a great movie or what? This movie is great in many aspects. The acting is great. Christian Bale gives the performance for which all his future work will be rated against. The script is funny, dark and gloomy whenever it feels like it. The look and feel of the movie is very 80's. For some the shots of skyscrapers reminded me of that old TV show 'LA Law'.-From this point on there are things that can be classed as spoilers. Ranging from small ones to heavy ones -
Some people may not like this movie for 2 reasons. The lack of plot and graphic violence and sex scenes. but the thing is the violence is hardly graphic (I think the most gruesome we get is when the serial killer swings an axe at someone and blood gets splattered on him and the floor). And the sex scenes... well they are graphic, but they are actually funny. Same with the murders. They all have this hilarious undertone that [to me] had me laughing through the entire 100 or so minutes.We start the movie off with black credits on the left of screen while on the right a red liquid drips down. We think it is blood since the movie is about a serial killer, but later on we find out it is actually a red berry sauce being served over a nice little meal at an expensive restaurant. Inside that restaurant we meet high power, 80's yuppie Patrick Bateman (the delectable Christian Bale). The movies anti-hero. Him and his fellow workmates talk about why they aren't getting served. Their thinking... because Patrick wont give the waiter oral sex. Later on we meet his fiance Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) as well as her best friend Courtney (Samantha Mathis), whom Patrick is having an affair with. Aswell as Courtney's fiance and patrick's workmate, who happens to be a closeted homosexual. We also meet another fellow worker on wallstreet Paul (Jared Leto).In a hilarious running joke through the film everybody thinks Patrick Bateman is really someone else who they talk about Patrick Bateman with. Saying he's stupid, annoying and down-right pathetic. The humour in American Psycho is very black. Infact it's probably safe to say that the humour is so black, it's impossible to ever gain colour again. BLACK! What do I mean by really black? For some reason I found myself in hysterics with a scene in which Patrick chases a prostitute around his apartment wearing nothing. Absolutely nothing... but unfortunately good ol' Mr. Bateman has a chainsaw covering his ""area"" and we don't see anything. Later on in the scene we have the girl running down the apartment stairwell and at reaching the bottom Patrick drops a chainsaw on her. Funny? Hell yes. Scary? no, not really.This movie isn't really scary. Scary as in Scream, Halloween etc because it is not a horror movie. it is a black comedy/80's satire.All the performances in AP are good. But the movie does belong to Christian Bale who is looking very buff and sexy in the many scenes in which his he is shirtless or fully naked. Be warned straight men, there are a lot of shots of Christian's body while in a shower though we don't see anything too raunchy. Just a little backside.Chloe Sivigny does very good as a the doe-eyed assistant to Patrick. Who does the best silent job ever. In the final scenes where she looks at patrick's work organiser and sees pictures of dead people that Patrick has drawn she just stares and is shocked. Even though she doesn't say anything it is very powerful. Willem Defoe is always cool. Here he plays a cop investigating Jared Leto's disappearance. Even the movie's co-writer/adapter has a role and a friend of Patrick.Over all this movie was great. Very well made but not for everybody. Mary Harron and co have done a very good job adapting the very nasty book (which I have not read). They should've at least been nominated for an oscar. And Christian Bale was robbed of an oscar this year. He simply deserves it... more so than Tom Hanks or Russell -tough guy- Crowe, who showed a lot more talent in The Insider.Anyway I loved this movie and hope you do too.And... with the much talked about ending. Try figuring it within a day... or week. I'm still scratching my head as too whether *all* the murders were real or imagined... blah blah blah I'm talking too long.10/10 or A+",American Psycho

Christian Bale's performance was commendable and brilliant, as was the other actor's. However, the ending of the film made out that all of the violence and murder committed throughout was in Patrick's head and never actually occurred. I think the film would've worked better if we see Patrick get away with what he did, and continue to kill undiscovered, as it would show how hidden things in life are. Some of the relationships and behaviours in the film were very bazaar and not expected, and unusually Patrick seemed to be one of the more normal characters, which was certainly not the aim of film.

The absurdity of Bale's character Patrick Bateman's shallowness and preoccupation with superficial things like how upset he gets over a colleague having a better business card than him makes this movie comedic while he's slicing up victims. Still not sure about whether or not all of the things happening were all in his head. I guess that's up for anyone's interpretation of the story.

I finally caught this movie on television and have seen it countless times.Mary Harron brilliantly circumvented the gore by making the movie a satire on American greed during the 1980's. Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, the quintessential hollow man, gives one of the most amazing performances in the history of movies. Why he didn't win an Oscar, I'll never know. He makes Patrick Bateman as memorable and tortured a monster as Norma Desmond in 'Sunset Boulevard.' Patrick is the 27-year-old CEO of a company whose obsession with status has turned him psychotic. He is a sociopath who embodies the meaning of the term 'cutthroat' by literally hacking the competition to death.

The cast is great and Christan is the only stand-out in my opinion.I was not sure if I should give it a 8, but it's not good enough, then 7, It's not that bad. I decided to go with 7 cause I could not see it be with those masterpieces that i give 8,9 or 10.We get to know Patric really well in the beginning of the film(like we got to know Jordan Belfort in the beginning of The Wold Of Wall Street), he's a man who takes care of him self dose not care about other, his needs are always a priority. I want to see other film do that instead of doing unnecessary scenes just to learn a character likes this kind of flower.Overall it's a good movie there's nothing really special but there were memorable moments in it that all movie buffs should know. It's not a have to see, but i recommend this film to anyone who likes (moderate) bloody films.",American Psycho
577,lsb-39292,Mixed feelings but very clever and funny.,7,1 February 2021,"I think the acting is very good, it shows a person who is at the very peak of psychopathy someone who has no empathy, moral compass or emotion and is completely engulf by there ego.
On this point they hit the mark but at times it is very hard to watch because of the gratuitous sex scenes, this is just down to personal preference but it just make me feel uncomfortable. For anyone else who doesn't mind these scenes you'll enjoy it.",American Psycho
578,MaccyXpert,Strangely crafted film held together by Christian Bale's genius performance,8,3 December 2017,"Kids, Bruce Wayne was a serial killer 5 years before he became Batman. Remember that. This movie is very brutal and creepy in pretty much all aspects. Patrick Bateman is a materialistic and shallow Wall Street dude by day and a murderer by night and his attitude doesn't even change much. None of the other characters seem to honestly care about him, nor does he care about them. However, the supporting cast still helps to build the atmosphere a lot and add to the story. He fits so well into his Wall Street life that nobody considers him to stand out. I don't class this as a horror film, but it is still graphic.After Bateman kills his first major victim in Paul Allen (Jared Letohnonobodycaresaboutyou) in a spectacular fashion (with older music accompanying him; a running theme), you assume that Bateman's experienced with cleaning up murders, given how well he does it to Allen. When the detective (Willem Dafoe, the Green Goblin from the original Spider Man films) arrives, you wonder how Bateman doesn't immediately trigger so many alarm bells. The conversations that Bateman has within his head are so fitting and very well written and add quite a lot to his character. Christian Bale's (at the head of two movies with 'American' in the title despite being English) performance is brilliant to the point where I have to give it its own rating of probably an 8.7/10. Patrick Bateman has been put alongside my favourite movie characters. He's a cool lunatic who just kills people in an insanely unique way.",American Psycho

I haven't actually read the book yet, but I've heard from a lot of people that it should be excellent. Too bad that the movie isn't. The actors are great (especially Christian Bale), you really get this 80's feeling and the crew has done a good work overall. So what's the problem then? Well, the script actually. The idea is interesting and the satire about the yuppie-world is clever, but after one hour or so you start nodding off, because at that time everything starts to feel somewhat samey. Too bad that they couldn't keep up the interest all the way based on such a plot... Doubtless one of the greatest disappointments of 2000.",American Psycho

582,DaveyScan,A great mind-trip movie..,8,31 May 2000,"(This review might contain a thing called spoiler. Beware)Christian Bale brings Patrick Bateman with `panache`. He is Patrick Bateman, very reasonable man, who never forget to do anything, is a rich yuppie in the 80ies, has no bad habit except one: he is one sick serial killer.The direction and the photography of the movie is perfect, the dialog is good (hilarious when Bateman speaks on music), the murders are chilling (running naked with a strange smile and a chain saw in his hands) and the suspense is quasi-hitchcockian.. There is a great plot twist at the end, which explain why this man really is American psycho. The great mass-killing ending is flawlessly delivered. The movie is not for the weak of heart. It 's (in my opinion) a stab at the 80ies over-consummation society.I give this movie a (high) 84% (8/10).P.S.: The dialog in this movie is really great, but the best line is right at the beginning when he says something about him not being there.",American Psycho
583,Orri-4,Good adaption,7,1 August 2000,"Very good adaption although I would have liked to see thescene at Dorsia when Bateman has no reservation and pretends to be someone else. It is a key element in thebook; one has to find out his limits. I also missed the urinalcake scene. It is a vivid example of his emptiness andcruelty. In fact there was to little of his relationship withEvelyn in the movie. There could also have been more ofhis voice on all the things filling his existence, clothing,tech, women etc. Lack of this makes the movie a bit slowpaced.It seems that Batemans attitude towards women was dampened in the film, in the book he is much more sarcastic and sometimes funny. I missed the comments on his secretary. Maybe it has something to do with the factthat the director is a woman.The soundtrack is brilliant and reminds me of Hitchcock.The girls wardrobe was a disappointment, they all seemedout of style, even for the eighties. Somehow beautiful girls(Reese Witherspoon, Samantha Mathis) loose their sex appeal. In general the over all look of the picture seems tobe suffering from a low budget.Christian Bale does a wonderful job on being Bateman, hisvampire-like mouth and expressions signaling insanity arevery inspiring.But most important: Thanks for not ruining one of my favorite novels.",American Psycho

585,capthowdy350,Just read the book.,2,10 March 2001,"American Psycho was an intense novel. However, the film adaption is poorly done on many levels. For one, Christian Bale despite having the right build and look for the character is not very believable as a psycho. His over-acting makes him look silly and not in the least bit scary or even intimidating. Not to mention the very selective approach to the sequencing of the film in comparison to the novel and the limited character development. Go to your local book store and pick up the novel but definitely pass on the movie.",American Psycho
586,user-11512,as a business major in accounting and finance this movie is disturbingly realistic,8,24 October 2006,"I am majoring in accounting and corporate finance and this movie sorta hits home in the fact of how fast-moving and emotionally detached the business world is from love, happiness, and consideration. Christian Bale accurately plays a businessman involved in world where money is taken for granted, massive amounts of money, appearance is everything (read The Prince by Machiavelli), and no one cares to even know each others name, nonetheless look each other in the eyes. No one looks out for each other as each businessman essentially looks out for himself and little else. This type of environment allows sociopaths, OCD manics, and psychopathic and serial tendencies to thrive. The treatment Christian Bale receives and more so dishes out to middle and poor classes and even his own rich class is ruthless and horrifying. The movie leaves you feeling very uneasy and distrusting of the big business corporate world, i take this personally too since i am heading into this corporate nightmare. I recommend this film very much, don't watch it as a date movie if your trying to get close to your partner, it kills moods because the film most likely will not leave you feeling any type of good. In a nut shell this film will leave you thinking heavily about how sick and disillusioned the prisoners of corporate America's world can become.",American Psycho
587,simon647,It's a wild world we live in.,9,29 June 2008,"I think that I've hardly seen a movie that is capable of depicting just how ""man eats man"" nowadays. Maybe Sweeney Todd did but it was a musical comedy and I wouldn't compare that movie to American Psycho.Still, what was disturbing about the movie is that every now and then, I could sympathize with the main ""protagonist"". I saw another movie with him as the 1st role and I have to say he was poor into it. This movie however told me not to judge an actor by a single movie. Sure sometimes he looked a little robotic but that's what happens when you're DIRECTED.This movie shows all sorts of truths about the everyday man that sometimes, I feel like anyone could be the mad killer. Anyone could suddenly walk up and shoot an old lady in the chest or start a killing spree just because they ""felt like killing"". We're so very weak yet we're so very strong. We're given all the tools to be judge and guilty.I found myself looking at the protagonist as some kind of hero, up until the end of the movie, where I found it almost cruel to see that all of this had been but in his mind. The girl opening up his note book seemed indication enough that this all had been nothing but Bateman's subconscious hacking at his mind. Driving him crazy with thoughts of mutilating women and using them as his sex slaves.Then again, this is maybe what a ""hero"" is. That's all a hero could be in our time where anything is brought up as a grand event. From the slightest birth to the worse death. Everything is preached, even the serial killers are preached at some point. This is why this movie is so effective: People end up wanting to see him kill people. Hell, when I heard the movie was about a guy just killing people because he felt like it, I wanted to see it.It's such a beautiful way to end this kind of fantastical adventure by telling you: ""Wouldn't you just like that? To think he's killed all these people and got away with it?"" I think even though I haven't spoken of the movie much, you should see it. It's a must for anyone having personal doubts about how well our society is currently built.I'm a Canadian and I still was able to see the references to the American dream depicted within this movie. I paid more attention to how well the whole thing rolled, up till the credits I was on the edge of my seat, always wanting to see more.A let-down some might say? I think it was more like a slap to the face.",American Psycho
588,jedijosh-1,"Good satire of yuppie life, bad movie about a psychopath",4,11 March 2008,"One of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying, it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked. One of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they (the yuppies) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art. While the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning, I find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner. If these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home, I would bet that American Psycho would be one of those movies.",American Psycho

590,vdecaire,The slippery-sloppy social and moral satire pays off in only a few categories.,7,21 July 2008,"Something for the guys: brutal killings and tense chase scenes. Something for the girls: Racy photos of Christian Bale were reveled around the opening of the movie on the internet, but then it was said they were just stills from the movie, also Reese Witherspoon's presence will attract swarms of viewers eager to see her be legally blonde again. Something for the critics: A dynamic performance from Bale as Patrick Bateman, the supple design and layout of the 80's is superb, and the direction by Mary Harron. Something for the trashcan: The sloppiness near the end, and the fact that it's too off-beat to ever deem a particular genre. Horror? Drama? Comedy? Musical(certain parts throughout the film have Bale doing rather interesting things while listening to Genisis and other 80's bands)? I can't say without giving away much, so do I recommend it? Yes and no. Again the off-beatness makes it one of those fast-forward-certain-parts, scenes that are okay are really okay, and parts that aren't, well, aren't. Lets say for example you are one of those who liked the book - to let you know, your one of the fifty in the world that weren't mad at Bret Easton Ellis for making what woman-support groups called ""filth"" - then you might not like the book, it's a politial satire rather then slasher, a character focus rather then a character study and most importantly you can see the killings, they didn't exactly jump out of the page did they?

A very dark satire indeed. This, by the way, is literally verbalized in the main character's last lines something in the regard of: I am unable to sympathize, I only want to inflict pain on others; Expressing my pain does not make me feel any better, hence I see no hope for our world. We are witness to the development in the character - an entirely soulless entity, a killing machine, the very extremes of his behaviour leading him to some type of catharsis. The catharsis, however, does not bring relief - he is bound to agonize forever, finding himself in a completely dehumanized environment. A glimpse of hope is still possible to catch through the only openly humane character of Jean, to whom our hero attempts to reach out in his utter agony (ironically, Jean is the only one he held back from killing). ""American Psycho"" is a brave, blunt, desperate social satire; the last warning signal there could be. It is so shocking, it is easy for the viewer with dull senses to see it as ""pointless"".",American Psycho
592,FLASHP01NT,American Psycho - Explanation - Spoilers,8,3 October 2020,"There are two main interpretations of the film:1. That Bateman is actually a psychological construct of Davis; The main character of the film is Davis. We are in the mind of Davis as he dreams about being Bateman.2. That Bateman is actually Bateman, and he does really kill people, but it's impossible for the police to pin the murders on him because nobody in corporate america knows each other, causing false negatives that interrupt the continuity of the criminal investigation.If you believe #1: The movie is a psychological reactionism to the monotony and inhumanity of corporate life; fantasizing about murder functions as an escape mechanism and helps Davis maintain his sanity.If you believe #2: Bateman is a sociopathic serial killer who is successful in business because of his negative pathologies. Bateman feels nothing and thought that murdering people would help him to feel something, but it didn't. In the end Bateman wants to be caught and punished; because then he would be put out of his misery. However Bateman can't be caught due to the nature of his employment, which makes him both invisible and void of responsibility.

The movie is not a horror movie, it is not a comedy, it is not a critic, it is not interesting  it is a waste of time. I do not personally recommend this movie unless you enjoy watching Christian bale naked, which is not my case. There's much wasted talent in this movie that makes you sick when you think about it.The only reason for which I gave the movie 3 and not even lower is because it has a nice review on some 80's Pop culture songs and Christian bale makes a very good performance as an actor.

It's stupid, boring and the story (not that there is much of one) is never fully explained. In the end I just sat there thinking well this is the biggest waste of time. It's confusing and the murder and sex scenes are just there for the heck of it - hoping that it might hold your attention. I watched this film fall further and further apart and I hoped that at the end it might all come together but I was too hopeful, obviously.

597,Shingle,Good enough to take a painkiller over!,7,15 June 2000,"American Psycho is based on Bret Easton Ellis' novel and I haven't even read it. But from they people that did not many really liked it, as it was highly controversial. When news came out that a movie was being made the controversy started again with groups wanting to boycott this film!Do I care? Do you? Seeing a guy running down a corridor wearing nothing but trainers and waving a chainsaw is something you'll probably only see in this movie and that's what matters the most here! Well. maybe!The film basically is set in the 80's and tells us about the character Patrick Bateman, a guy who seems to be losing control of himself and is killing lots of people! Moving away from the basic premise. no wait, that's pretty much it! So the plot is very thin, but there's more to this then you might think.Patrick Batemen is a Wall Street broker who never really seems to be busy. He has a girlfriend Evelyn (Witherspoon), a very classy apartment, takes frequent trips to exclusive restaurants, and has an average business card. Bateman also has another side to him, this being killing people when he has the time, and he has a lot of it! Christian Bales performance is outstanding as we're invited to look into Patrick Batemens life, someone who is out of control with his life and losing himself, yet he still manages to get away with it by showing himself as the guy you see going to work. Also the films portrayal of the 80's gives you a lot to laugh about! The clothes, the music, the people, the technology. How just about everything in the 80's was quite crap really. Batemen going on endlessly about his knowledge of music being one point!I'm sure most people out there will see this as one of those violent movies with no point at all. How very wrong they are. There isn't as much violence as you might think, with the camera panning away from extreme shots, yet this still might be likely to offend.  As for being classed as a slasher or horror movie, this is more in fact a comedy then anything else with the movie making fun of the setting and it's characters, mainly Patrick Batemen. But really the situations and dialogue all raise a laugh somewhere as well as a shock. Its use of mistaken identity seems to be the films point as to how everyone is someone, but no one fully knows anyone at all with people easily being mistaken for others. The ending is a little perplexing and it makes the whole thing feel unfinished as to whether Batemen did these murders or were they just something he made up? Checking the Internet Movie Database message for this film will show a range of topics with most deciding the ""did he"" or ""didn't he"" argument. On the whole other cast members put in a worthy performance but they don't match up to that of Christian Bale!The film is great, sharply funny and a little hard on the head after leaving the cinema. But still I can't help feeling that there should have been more.My rating - 7 out of 10",American Psycho

I have not yet read the other users reviews, but at this point I still wonder whether the murders were a dream, or were real, but covered up by the family of Paul Allen.  I suspected the latter, but am still not sure.  Anyway, the most remarkable part of this film is the performance of Christian Bale.  His character was dark, debonair, menacing, and hilarious at the same time.  Some people have compared him to Jack Nicholson in the shining, but I would say this is more like Rod Serling playing a combination of the Alex character from Clockwork Orange and Jack the Ripper.  This is a great surprise, given his earlier work, and probably will elevate him to superstar status in short order. I can see him as a leading candidate for portraying a number of roles from the next James Bond, to Count Dracula.  He also does such a great Rod Serling imitation that he would be a natural as a host for a new Twilight Zone. Anyway,  this is a great film and I highly recommend it toanyone.",American Psycho

601,Al_James,"A classic satire, with blistering performances.",10,16 July 2001,"Personally, I feel like I have so much to thank Leonardo DiCaprio for. Every true film fanatic should praise God that he passed up the opportunity to star in this movie, allowing Christian Bale to step in and steal every single moment of the film.It's not all about Bale, but he is the reason that this film worked on so many different levels. DiCaprio wouldn't have got near the edginess, dementia and sheer anger that Bale coolly conveys.On the whole though, this film is a crunching, no-holds barred satire that critically scrutinises the joys and horrors of the 80's. Being an 80's child, even I can level with the fact that my only memories of the era are soothing pop ballads and materialistic struggles that even overspilled into the playground! Having studied the 80's though, I recognise even more, the extreme detail that Harron pays to the isolated, drug-fuelled, uniformity of a generation that would rather have a clear credit card, than a clear conscience.Violent? Yes. Disturbing? Yes. Gratuitous? Not at all. There's nothing you haven't seen before if you're a real movie fan. However, what there is plenty of, is overblown hype about how violent and 'twisted' the movie actually is. In years to come, people will realise that this movie was as misread as 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Taxi Driver' and hail it-just like the aforementioned movies- as a masterpiece.If you're going to read the book, see the movie first. They're both superb, but the movie will make you think of Bale as Bateman, and that makes the book all the more exciting and easier to visualise. This is, in my opinion, a close third for the best screen adaptation ever. Just behind 'The Godfather' and 'Silence Of The Lambs' respectively.What you have in this movie is a great ensemble cast (Witherspoon, Sevigny, Dafoe and Leto are all at their excellent best, and Theroux as Pryce is a real revelation), an unusual sense of coldness (every shot seems glazed over, icy) and one of the greatest 'madman' performances ever to be, well, performed.

This one actually had character development. I suppose one could say it's a slasher film with a story.Patrick Bateman is a business man who lives almost a perfect life. He eats healthy, works out and keeps up with his apartment. But there's something that controls him. His urge to kill. It was never said why he killed but with the narration and Christian Bale's facial reactions; I believe it's up for you to judge.This movie is good for some quotes. It also has great acting and story. The deaths weren't all to predictable. But you pretty much knew who was next. The ending also leaves you questioning.

It is not for the faint of heart, but looking past the gore you will see there is a great deal going on here.The film is nominally about a very eccentric Wall Street type whose life revolves around the parties, the lunches & the women that make up his lifestyle.  At first you are hit with the utter weirdness of this guy's mannerisms...no one would associate with this wacko in real life. 
At first you figure ""he's overplaying.""  Then, as you get deeper into the film, you realize what is going on here.  This is not life in the real world.  This is life inside this guy's head... it's his subconcious.  You are never told this... you have to figure it out; none of the characters ever walks up to the screen and announces it.  But, once you get it, the film is much more enjoyable and it finally begins to make a sort of bizarre sense.For a genre that is too often too campy, too violent without cause, and too brainless, American Psycho is a breath of fresh air.  It appears campy at first.  It is violent, especially towards women.  But it is not brainless.Take the time to actually watch this movie and think about it.

It worked with Less Than Zero, but it doesn't work here.Part of the reason is that Christian Bale is totally unconvincing as our 80's American Psycho. Whether he was miscast in the role or given bad direction, I don't know. He did not play a creep as true as, say a Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino. He more or less comes across as a Hollywood actor trying to play a crazy guy, and not pulling it off.Moreover, the film seemed disjointed, like they had different strategies for what they were trying to accomplish. I could almost tell that certain shots were taken on the same day, and other shots taken on other days had a completely different feel. It was also unclear to me if the murders were real or just imagined by our Patrick Bateman. Perhaps, I wasn't watching the movie that closely. And perhaps, that wasn't really my fault. It was hard to endure.",American Psycho
607,ben-eastwood,An American Gem,10,20 March 2011,"Wow. What a film! All I can say is that this is one of my all time favourite films. It just keeps you entertained. Christian Bale is absolute genius. He goes from being a crazy and deluded killer, to a panicky nerd, to a corny music-buff know-it-all, to a self obsessed business man. And just as Bale's performance does, the story also jumps around. It start out as a Sex In The City style narrated romantic comedy, to an extremely sick and black comedy, to a grisly horror. The scenes where Bateman is explaining his albums are hilarious, as is the scene where he says, ""I experienced a moment of sheer panic when I noticed that his apartment looks out over the park, and was clearly more expensive than mine.' as is the business card scene. And the chainsaw scene is very intense. I have to say though, for it's reputation as a very violent film, although graphic, most violence is offscreen. My only criticism is the mass murder scene where the car blows up. It if is a hallucination, then it works fine, but if you are in the same belief group as me, (That it all really happened) then you may fell that it is completely implausible and a plot gap. Having said that, this film is my first EVER 10/10.",American Psycho

610,jhnachos,A character study like no other,10,15 March 2017,"Where do I start with American Psycho. This film is a classic and should be remember for solely for the character of Patrick Bateman. Christian Bale gives one of the best performances I have ever seen. He grabs your attention and sucks you in to this universe. His line delivery is fantastic and while the magnificent screenplay helps, Bale instantly makes the character his own and commands the screen, despite other strong performances. The direction and cinematography are great, but clearly the focus of the film goes to the riveting Patrick Bateman. Every line that Bale says becomes iconic and it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. Overall American Psycho is masterful character study with strong, performances direction, cinematography and a flawless script. Bale delivers a performance that might upset some people based on how distributing he can be, but if look hard enough, you will see that American Psycho is a movie like no other.",American Psycho
611,GregForstner,Sensational adaption of a scandal novel,8,1 January 2015,"Enter fabulous Patrick Bateman, successful Wall Street broker and nowadays embodiment of evil not only for his job, which is held in rather low regard these days, but for the things he does at night. It takes an actor as brilliant as Christian Bale to deliver a believable impersonation of a handsome powerful womanizer who ruthlessly indulges his darkest desires. Of course, some may see this movie as problematic because the viewer is forced into the perspective of a psychopathic serial killer who is simply too shining, too smooth, too perfect to be caught for his heinous crimes. Bateman can hardly be someone you sympathize with but then you are made to feel his abysmal desperation and his escapist fantasies. The horrendous ambiguity of the main character may be the overarching theme of this movie – in the end, we are left to guess whether the atrocious acts of violence took place in reality or merely in the mind of a seriously deranged personality. There are two main interpretations for the riddle this movie constitutes: 1. In the first interpretation, Bateman really is the incarnation of Norman Bates and yes, he has pornographic sex with prostitutes before he slaughters them. Being probably slightly aware of the evil he is doing, he rarely lets go of a chance to confess to his crimes that reveal his true character. Remember the scene when he tells drunken Paul Allen in this Mexican restaurant that he likes to dissect women and that he was ""utterly insane""? But as so often, his fellow human beings ignore his confessions; it is as though they were unable to face the truth. They rely on their fixed image that they have of Bateman as an attractive successful CEO who can buy anything he wants. The power he has makes him intangible for the authorities. Then there is also room for the interpretation that they confuse the identities of one another because some of them have exactly the same job and they look very much alike. This hands Bateman a perfect alibi for his murder of Paul Allen and so Bateman even escapes the tricky interrogations with the private detective, played by Willem Dafoe. In a metaphorical reading, Wall Street is turned into a hotbed of moral corruption in which only surfaces and material values matter. A man as intelligent as Bateman has no difficulties at maintaining the false image he stands for but what is more horrifying is that no one cares who he really is. There are no borders set for him, neither by the law nor by common conventions. In this reading we can see Bret Easton Ellis's intention of crafting a jarring satire on the condition of American society in the 1980s, which is marked off by its superlative dark humor. 2. In the second interpretation, Bateman is a serial killer in his mind only. The terrible aggressions that he seems to harbor are unleashed in his bloody visions which are growing more and more intense. Possibly owing to high medications and a psychosis, Bateman thinks he really does the things he only dreams of or envisions. Thus, in the somewhat weird ending he is utterly desperate and close to madness when he learns that his lawyer ate dinner with a colleague he believes to have murdered long ago. I think the direction of Mary Harron suggests that the second interpretation is more likely. Take for example the scene before the ending when Bateman's secretary spies on his notebook and discovers all the gory drawings of his, thereby also seeing the real character of Bateman behind the surface. Being what it is, ""American Psycho"" is one of the most misunderstood movies of film history. This is not a slasher flick that puts a lot of gratuitous violence on display. But it still has elements of a horror movie in it. It is not so much meant to shock than to make the audience think about what they've just seen. It's a dark satire that works seemingly adverse elements of various genres into a whole and it is a testimony to the greatness of Christian Bale, who renders the range of all possible emotions visible and manages one of the most controversial figures of modern cinema.",American Psycho

This film does not concern at all the history of PatrickBaitman, a perverted person at most of you. Patrick is narcissists and is becoming o a symbol of all humans. Really , how many from you have not thought the same for their competitors. Simply into this point enters the mental factor that appears in the film in order not to misunderstand the director. Patrick stops acting like a person but behaves as an animal, he tries to exterminates his enemies and he dominates. Patrick is above everyone. Money determines the relations of persons in this film. The Film moves between fantastic and real.The director excellently has attributed fiction verisimilitudewhile we are watching the conflicts that happen in our hero: leave his instincts to guide him or to rein? The more times first predominates but with Liz didn't kill her . Sadistis and schizophrenic is Patrick no because ''kills'' in his manner women but because he imagines that really kill them. The film remained in the middle because the thoughts will not be late becomes action! However Patrick isn't like the other murderers who have sense what they do. Tragic is that he does not have sense of his actions. he imagines what would want him shelf to become but alas social reality bounds him, he feels oppressed and the imagination is the best medicine in these circumstances, however his imagination is sick or no? Maybe he is afraid to know the true love and resorts to the market love? Or he just abominated his girl because she blatantly showed that she had relation with other man and in consequence he adopts such a behavior of the women?

614,adamafrixal,American Psycho (2000) : Twisted Mind or Twisted Reality?,8,10 October 2018,"Really, I have no high expectation for this movie when I watched it and just go for it because it was Christian Bale playing Bateman before Batman (get it? Such bad joke). I found myself surprised at the interesting plot twist and intense moment the movie managed to portray even under normal conversation in the office.
American Psycho tells the story of seemingly perfect young man named Patrick bateman played by Christian Bale. He seems like the perfect young man, which have his life managed, but seems to have controlling tendencies, perfectionist to the extreme and can look like a freak at times.
I think the story exert the tale of control over one self and hidden story every people have behind their façade to ""fit in"" in life. I personally hate the affair thing, but they are all jackass and rude in their own way. They love to compete over simplest thing in the office from clothing, reservation at dorsia, Work performance even business card.
Patrick Bateman seems disconnected from people, and seems like a sore loser. Overly competitive and killing he deemed unworthy without batting an eye or anyone he felt threatening to his presence. Such as a hobo, and Allen Paul. He wanted to be different and be special in a sea of people with similar attributes and quality in this world. However, he did it by becoming a psychopathic killer.
The story really takes a nice turn when his killing tendencies are started to be unraveled by the appearance of Detective Donald Kimball played by William Dafoe who have been hired to investigate the disappearance of Paul Allen. Patrick felt his reality threatened and become more and more unstable with time. Thus, he cannot accept to continue his usual life and killing habit. Moreover, in the end it is questionable whether he is mental that cannot accept reality or he now accept that he is living in a twisted reality with lack of empathy within the people.
There are so much things to learn from the movies, and I believe I understand the mind of people better, and how our society are shaped and how twisted it can be. A fun twisted and confusing ride from start to finish. I rate it 8/10.",American Psycho

Christian Bale's performance is the only reason to watch this film. He IS Patrick Bateman, it's downright scary. He is one of the best actors of his generation. For example; there is one scene where Bateman calls up his lawyer to confess his killings, this is probably one of the most well acted scenes in film history. He goes through about 25 emotions at once, amazing. As for the rest of the cast as far as i'm concerned they were wasted. Especialy Willem Dafoe and Reese Witherspoon. Dafoe is a great actor he just dosen't have anything to work with. Reese Witherspoon is a good actress, but I think she was miscast. I also think Chloe Sevigny was miscast as Jean also.

It could have gone two ways, into a sharp, biting satire (like, say, ""The Player"") or into a more disturbed, unsettling comedy (like ""Parents"").  Sadly, it floundered somewhere in the middle and delivered neither a rewarding comedy nor an involving psychological thriller.

621,StupidHumanSuit,Because I want to fit in,10,16 September 2009,"American Psycho is one of my favorite films of all time. With Christian Bale's performance to the brilliant direction of Mary Harron, this film has gained the cult status it has deserved. Patrick Bateman lives an excessive but empty life as an investment banker who cares for nothing but himself, his looks and how he blends into society. I don't find this film as controversial as most people would make it out to be. It shows very little violence and it more so implies violence rather than show it. It is not Hostel or Saw. It is more like Funny Games. Something very realistic where showing absolutely no violence or the cause of violence is more terrifying than the actual act. This film becomes less terrifying and completely envelopes you into being completely floored and interested in Patrick Bateman and his line of thought. You don't need to feel sympathy for Bateman, nor should you. Only interest. Bateman truly is an enigma. This is the true meaning of a dark comedy. This is somewhat the real influence for my second favorite television show of all time, Dexter. So bleak and horrible, making you laugh made you feel almost uncomfortable with yourself. By the end of the film, you see the ambiguous truth. Does he truly act on his psychotic tendencies, or is he just violently delusional?

Blown away with Christian Bale's performance, who up until then I'd only seen in Nolan's Batman trilogy, which managed to be hilarious, narcissistic, sympathetic and absolutely terrifying in equal measure! The way it's shot is beautiful too, the long wide shots of Patrick's apartment, the night scenes in the back alleys, even the opening scene of Patrick's routine, just lit so well and his apartment is almost too white, in stark contrast to what his night time activities end up looking like.It's so devilishly funny as well, with most of the humour provided by Bale.

Truly magnificent acting performance by christian bale as american psycho signifies the rise of Christian Bale as an actor. Movies like these helped him with roles in Batman trilogy. It contains chilling and horrifying scenes where he feeds a stray cat into an ATM machine and murders a destitute vagrant in the dark allies. Truly excellent portrayal of a maniac who gets his kick by taking lives of people by gruesome means. Patrick Bateman cannot exist in real because no one will get off with the murders on the streets, people and cops would eventually notice.

632,GMeanie,A brilliant dark satire,10,8 February 2001,"After reading so many bad reviews from people who obviously didn't get this film at all, I feel I have to set the record straight. American Psycho is a satire. A very dark and horrific satire, but still a satire.American Psycho, the book, is the most mind-blowing piece of fiction I have ever read. It is a very cleverly written book, yet the violence depicted is so explicit that I found it hard to continue reading in parts. The film is only for those with thick skin, but compared to the book, its Disney.Those who criticize the film for not being as violent as the book obviously fail to realize that if it was, it would have been banned in every country on the planet. While the majority of violence happens off-screen, I don't feel that this is in any way a disgrace to the book.The best part of American Psycho is not the violence (which serves mainly as a distraction), but the narrative from Bateman, and the opportunity to go inside his head as see what pushes him over the edge. Patrick Bateman is a very wealthy, handsome, young, intelligent Wall St yuppie in the late 80's, who seemingly has everything. So the question put to the viewer is: What would turn a man like Bateman into such an angry, evil, sadistic psychopath? The answer is: The society and people around him.Bateman's world, and that of his friend's, who all share similar lifestyles to him, is one that is dominated by image, one-upsmanship, and, most importantly, rampant materialism. From the examining of business cards, to demanding of having reservations at top restaurants even when not hungry, to Bateman's flawless knowledge of fine business suits, it is the never ending excessive materialism of the New York yuppie which drives Bateman insane. As Christian Bale quoted of his character ""with Bateman the clothes really do make the man"".While Bateman comes off as a completely ruthless man who is a master of everything in his environment, in reality its completely different. The materialism which consumes Bateman and his friends, also leaves them nameless. Often, Bateman is mistaken for someone else by a colleague of his. It is only Bateman's bloodlust which makes him feel like an individual.For those who have never read the book, and watch this movie for the first time the twist at the end (the most redeeming twist ever) may seem ridiculous. However, this is a film that when watched for a 2nd time will make complete sense. There are so many subtle hints throughout this movie (such as in the opening titles when what appears to be dripping blood in fact turns out the be decorative sauce on one of Bateman's ultra expensive power lunches) that will seem so obvious the 2nd time, but were understandably ignored the 1st time around when confronted by Bateman's violence. Remember, this entire film is narrated though the eyes of Bateman, so things are not always as they seem.All in all this was an amazing film. The acting was flawless. Christian Bale absolutely stole this show. To get inside Bateman's head and do it this convincingly was quite a feat .The imagery was deceptive and clever, and the musical score fitted the film perfectly.10/10 - the best film of 2000

The director and the writers had no clue what the ending even was. And sometimes that's good, when filmmakers leave things open ended even to themselves, but this one just get very try hard. Like they were trying to make Fight Club but with a serial killer. Overall, I don't recommend. Christian Bale was incredible, but it's just dumb.

I can accept the ambiguity or lack of clarity in a film by Bergman or Antonioni because the entire films tend to be consistent in their tone and message. ""Blow Up"" is ambiguous in the end because the entire film's premise concerns the lack of certainty in a photographed image - if the photograph can't be trusted, can the crime be proved to have happened? AP ends up being a case of the Unreliable Narrator and it's left to the audience to put the pieces together -- which ultimately don't fit in a coherent way.

The plot, particularly the ending leaves a large hint of ambiguity, allowing the viewers to have their own interpretation of the film's important elements.

642,jte6451,"American Psycho Review - Money, Materialism, & Murder",9,12 February 2019,"""I have to return some videotapes."" - Patrick BatemanYou know, I love horror films. Who doesn't? There's nothing more entertaining than turning the lights out at night and watching a good scary movie. But my favorite kind of horror is psychological horror. You see, with psychological horror it's not about a monster, a masked killer, or a zombie apocalypse, but it's about the fear and horror within yourself and it also explores what drives someone to kill. One film that manages to take that concept and mixes with satirical 80s black comedy and ending up being, for the most part, devilishly clever, insane, and hilarious at the same time is American Psycho.Based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same name, the story follows Patrick Bateman, who, by day he's a wealthy, but self-centered and materialistic stock broker in 1980s New York, but by night he's a bloodthirsty, psychopathic, and deranged serial killer who kills people to indulge his sadistic fantasies. But the line between reality and fantasy begin to blur as Patrick's dark side starts to reveal itself on his mask of seemingly outer perfection as his bloodlust rises.While it's not really a straight up horror film, it's more like a character study of someone who, on the surface, may seem like he's literally living the Dream and has a lavish lifestyle, but, in reality, he's a lunatic who craves murder, torture, and sex. This movie also satirizes the 80s Yuppies culture; young and wealthy people who work high-end jobs, have dinner at lavish restaurants, and pretty much say or do whatever they want without any sort of repercussions.However, it doesn't stray the focus away from the main character, thanks to its well-written screenplay. Much of the story is told from Patrick's point-of-view; he's obsessed with the lavish lifestyle; always trendy, always looking handsome, and living among the rich & elites, all this which hides his psychopathic dark side. But, at the same time, he despises it and often criticizes it for how shallow and soulless it can be, despite being obsessively indulged in it.I especially do like the look of the film and how it feels like the period that took place at the time. Cinematography is also on point here, especially viewing which side of Patrick we're seeing. It can be calm and soothing when he is normal, but then becomes crazy when he goes ballistic and starts killing people with an ax, a nail gun, and a chainsaw. Editing moves the film at a steady pace and the soundtrack cleverly fits with both the setting and events that unfold. You'll never hear the song ""Hip to Be Square"" the same way again.Lastly, the performances; they all do their parts well, but it's Christian Bale who is the real star as Patrick Bateman. This was the film that made Bale into a household name, and this was before he was Batman in The Dark Knight Trilogy. It's amazing how committed an actor like Bale can be to match his physicality with the character's physical appearance as well as diving into the psyche of a psychopath.Overall, American Psycho is an interesting blend of comedy, horror, and satire that just works. The only thing that I didn't like too much was the third act, which I feel is when it started to decline a bit. But the humor, the satire of yuppies culture of the 80s, the excellent direction, and Bale's performance makes this an underrated gem. Defiantly worth watching.Final Verdict: 9/10 with the Epic Seal of Awesomeness.Now if you'll excuse me, I have to return some videotapes.",American Psycho
643,arthurff6,Charming and sophisticated atmosphere of a horror satire,8,13 November 2011,"Seeming at first sight, and judging by the title, just the initial torrent of psychopathic clichés, the surprise is gratifying when the film is unmasked into sapid entertainment. The immediate ''visceral carnage psycho-thriller'' image, that the headline induces previously, is early replaced by the charming and sophisticated atmosphere of a horror satire.This macabre tale does not branch away from the main character, played by Christian Bale, who as usual incorporates the personification dexterously. In his enthralling idiosyncrasies, capable of converting a passionate and accurate analysis of the 80's New Wave/Synthpop musical scene into a morbid foreplay for slaughter, the charismatic lunatic carries the movie on mild tension. His misadventures are filled with rabid and lascivious displays of violence, but subtly reflecting the crude humor of a proper black comedy. However, it is not until the approach of the final scene, in a boisterous, confusing sequence, that the interest is awoke for good. These tumultuous events culminate in a not so frustrating open end, adorned with an impenetrable monologue that was surely made to last.Discovering only later that American Psycho was based on a homonym novel was disappointing, for now the whole possibility of an actual fun reading was ruined or at least seriously compromised. Although never reading the original, I suppose is safe to conjecture that the story was decently portrayed, and this seem to have facilitated the whole ''cult becoming'' path that the film had roam. If not, the closing speech was worth the price of a poor adaptation.",American Psycho

645,simon-thome2,It's Not Hip To Be Square!,8,5 January 2006,"First of all I need to say I did not read the original but watched a masterpiece of a movie.It's a groundbreaking thrilling movie and outstandingly hilarious at the same time which is definitely its greatest accomplishment.As you get to know Bateman you discern that on the one hand he's riven by his desire to conform with the rules of high society and its values and on the other hand yearns for leading a meaningful life of individuality. These two conceptions conflict massively causing him to drift into a surreality in which he takes the role of a serial killer who kills preferably young pretty girls.Gore and violence are now Bateman's compensations for real life values like friendship and love. But as he states repeatedly he feels nothing, is emotionless. Slaughering his way from carnage to carnage he eventually finds himself more meaningless than ever before as his lawyer, who doesn't even know him by face, mistakes him for somebody else and is not believing his desperate confession.Bateman's inner conflict, which is by the way one of the most funniest features of the movie, is portrayed outrageously just because it's never intended to be taken much too serious. So it causes you to laugh about Bateman's behavior several times which is not common for that kind of film genre. These exceptions makes that film complete and unique.One last comment on the actor's performances, let me start with Christian Bale who really fit into that role. He totally impersonated Bateman. Willem Dafoe as a sharp detective who is always ambiguously indicating his doubts about Bateman's innocence, played his part brilliantly too. A complete movie with little not worth of mentioning flaws which never had a bad effect on the movie itself.8/10 One of my favorites.",American Psycho
646,anthony-d-mills,Very clever but missing something,6,2 January 2019,"I felt this film was very well done. The direction was brilliant as was the acting. Christian Bale shone as Patrick Bateman creating a tense and unnerving tone. Whilst having a great story, the off screen violence distracts from the story, making it more difficult to see things from Patrick's point of view. I feel this makes the character a bit distant with the audience and prevents any kind of bond or understanding with him.",American Psycho

648,benatarandres,Hey Paul.,8,17 May 2016,"It would be a mistake for anyone viewing this film to search for meaning, when the story, the characters, and the culture within are utterly worthless. Any purpose they think they might have, or any significance they place on their meager actions are masked by a cloud of indifference so large that all there really is but the very delusion of the yuppie culture that further perpetrated such shallowness. It is from this nothingness that American Psycho can actually acquire meaning in its overall analysis of a capitalistic culture, which is enabled by soulless snobs that model themselves after Donald Trump. American Psycho is adapted from the novel of the same name by Brett Easton Ellis, who got a lot of flak upon the release back in 1991 for its portrayal of violence towards women, along with its misogynistic protagonist Patrick Bateman. It's not a pretty film to watch given its gruesome form of violence. But it can be amusing in its own sadistic fashion, as Christian Bale and other talented actors all depict a culture so sexist, and so indifferent to their materialistic gains that the only thing a viewer can do while watching is laugh at how disgusting the world of American Psycho is, and what it says about how American culture itself has become so soulless and boring to the point where it seems like we've been butchering each other for decades on and on. The setting is during the 1980's, and the story is mostly focused on the life of Yuppie, Patrick Bateman (Bale), who through his calm and subtle narrations, enlightens us viewers with his story and the very details he takes into account. Patrick gives us his address, workout regimen, taste for well-tailored suits, fine dining, and even his newly developed desire for murder. Patrick's contemplation of his craving at times can be at a blur, given that he does not fully understand his newly developed lust. And even the pattern in which he selects his victims can be at times random. It's hard to tell who he is particularly aiming at, or if he is trying to aim at that matter, given that most of his murders are executed with brutal and monstrous violence, but with poor ambiguity. Whether Patrick cuts off his associate's head clean off, or drops a chainsaw over a girl's back, one thing for sure is that he never gets caught. Strange to imagine, but most of Bateman's murders often go unpunished, or unnoticed, no matter how much he utters such confessions as, ""I like to dissect girls"", or ""Did you know I'm utterly insane?""Be it drugs, alcohol, or meaningless materialism, Bateman and his colleagues are the purest representations of 1980's yuppies, as they frequent nightclubs, carry mistresses, and utter their own misogyny as though they were the remarks of poets than that of pigs. The only thing that separates Bateman from this cloth of snobs more is his desire for carnage as he repeatedly narrates about his confusion to this newly developed craving, thus illustrating a darker and more horrifying critique of this capitalist culture. Patrick Bateman is funny, being mostly cynical and overly chauvinistic to the point where he himself is a joke of an indifferent and materialistic era in American culture. His desire for money, fine clothing, physical perfection, and even his drug cravings represent the more typical representations of an American yuppie. But his violent appetite for murder and rape lead his mind to slip into more nihilistic territory, as he describes himself as , ""I am simply not there"", while equally lamenting over his victims demises. It's hard to determine whether or not these murders are actually committed, considering how Patrick is able to get away with them perfectly, and yet hardly ever bringing any effort into covering them up. This term ""normal"" is something that completely alludes a character such as Patrick Bateman. He does all he can to appear normal and to ""fit in"", as he stresses it and he even indulges in the same stupidities as his colleagues. And yet, he is far from the average human. Yes, he has flesh, blood, skin, and hair, but he claims that his emotions are not identifiable to other people, and even though he has small traces of those emotions whenever he tries to connect with his Secretary Jean (Sevigny), who has a crush on him, and in Patrick's eyes is the only person he can't bring himself to hurt, despite his attempts. Maybe Patrick's violent sadism is focused on the yuppies who mindlessly live with their drug use and their lavish spending, or maybe his new appetite is the signification that he has reached a higher state of being, thus surpassing the materialistic means of the culture of which he has dwelled in and very much become a victim of for too long. It's never certain as to what brought out this sudden desire for mayhem in Patrick. But it is all he knows and wants from this point on, as he sees that the world is riddled with the sort of indifference that enrages and allows him to justify his sadistic desire to kill. American Psycho is a cult thriller, with its equal share of laughs, but that's only if you have a dark side of your own. In the big picture, it is a critique of capitalism, and the sort of indifference and apathy it cultivates and nurtures to the point where it becomes habit and routine for people like Bateman. But on a deeper level, I think it is reasonable to say that this criticism is also focused on Bateman's violent appetite, which is a result of this culture, and it is the next step as he has surpassed the indifference that materialism fosters, and embarked on journey that will probably not change or mean anything significant to the world, given that he sees it as nothing but an abyss of meaninglessness, with merely corpses to fill his lust.",American Psycho
649,wlawson60,Cruelty and Christian Bale,7,7 June 2008,"A very funny horror flick. A worthy companion piece to its literary roots. A phenomenal, fearless performance by Christian Bale that, in a way, cleared up my questions about this versatile British actor. I could never quite warm up to him. Not even in ""Little Women"". Now, Bale as Patrick Bateman, revealed the reason. It is the cruelty around his mouth. His smiles are chilling and they work to perfection in this, his yuppie modern monster.His actions have the pristine shallowness of his business cards and the disgusting taste of his self awareness. You don't feel sorry for him, the way one did for Norman Bates. No, his character is unredeemable. His rough sex with two women while he rides one of them looking at himself in the mirror is one of the most disturbing film moments I've ever seen.

650,Dr Evil-5,Stylish,9,6 February 2001,"Having started reading the novel ""American Psycho"" by Bret Easton Ellis and given up, I decided to let the wonder that is cinema finish the story for me. Having seen the film, I've now re-started the book.This film, although slightly ambiguous at times, was a real surprise. Christian Bale was excellent as the Patrick Bateman, the fictitious Wall Street killer from the book. Mary Harron wisely decided not to show the graphic crimes described in the book, instead opting to suggest acts have taken place and leave the details up to the imagination of the viewer. This is a far more effective method of telling the story and avoiding controversy, imaging how this film would've turned out if Paul Verhoeven or someone similar had directed.Despite the rather grim subject matter, there is plenty of black humor in this film - Patrick Bateman asking a hooker if she takes a credit card - for example.The music and visual style of the film are good, there are plenty of tracks from the eighties, we're also treated to some highly amusing views on the music of the era from Bateman.This film is very enjoyable and, although the ending will not satisfy everyone, it is well worth watching.9/10",American Psycho
651,sintelars,I expected something else,5,26 May 2000,"In about 9 years ago i heard about this book that was being banned here in Norway. It was ""provokingly violent"" and contained ""sick details about a serial killer"", i believe it also in one radio show was called ""typical american, that means -no moral""...I was intrigued. I`ve always been interested in human behaviour and fascinated by serial killers (not that i think its a good thing).
I read the book and i belive it is the best book ever written. I`ts not poetic and certainly not teardripping.It`s simply a fascinating story about Patrick Bateman and his life. If you read this comment you`ve probably allready seen the movie or read the book so i won`t go into details...On the other hand i will tell you my thoughts about the movie:1. Christian Bale plays a good Bateman, but he should have been portrayed as taller, more brutal, powerful and on the edge!2. It should have started with a look back at the eighties, and not just take it for granted that the audience knows. Bateman should have entered the movie later, and on a time that we were not expecting it.3. Bale is more than ok when it comes to Batemans coldness and numness. On the other hand you never see a glimpse of Patricks insanity: that crazy look that tells you he`s gonna eat his victims brain for dinner, or stick a knife through someones eye really slowly.4. In the book you get a much greater sense of how Bateman treats other people as thin air. In the movie it seems like he actually care sometimes.And most important:5. It`s totally impossible to make a movie of this book and not let the audience see any terror, fright, physical and not least the mental hell Batemans victims go through. All you can see is a few corpses hanging in a closet, when he kicks a dog and shoots a few people. This is not Patrick Bateman from the book, it`s a regular thriller movie about a man gone bad. Not a man gone monster.I understand that the film has gotten many good rewievs becouse of this. I could not disagree more. The fact that kids (15 year olds) are allowed to see it in Norway tells a lot...I hope one day another director with a vision to realise Patrick Bateman comes along.Untill then, I prefer the book.",American Psycho
652,catbyte9,Avoid this movie at all cost,1,29 September 2000,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  After watching it I feel that director Mary Harron owes me 101 minutes of my life (and the $3.00 for the video rental).  This could have actually been a relatively entertaining movie if they had actually given the movie a point of some sort.  I won't give it away, in case anyone is foolish enough to want to throw away 101 minutes of their life despite my warning), but the movie has a surprise twist at the end, which completely fails to make any sense whatsoever no matter how you interpret the movie or the annoyingly ambiguous ending. Christian Bale, as the title psycho, gives a performance that could have been an interesting skit for Jim Carrey on In Living Color but is completely wasted in this movie by Ms Harron.

Bateman is charismatic, intelligent, classy, and frightening. I applaud Christian Bale for taking on this role. Lately he's been casted as sadistic, scary characters that audiences can't help but take an interest in. I can't wait to see him as Batman. He'll play it deliciously.

This is one of his earlier movies that really stood out and showcased his amazing talent. I had a tough time finding this movie on DVD. I looked high and low for almost a year, and when I finally got my hands on it, I was really excited and relieved. After watching this movie, all I can say is the long wait was absolutely more than worth it. Christian Bale's performance in this movie reminded me of two of his other movies, Equilibrium and The Machinist. In American Psycho, Patrick's character can be really cold and emotionless at times, which is very similar to the main protagonist in Equilibrium. Christian Bale can really put on an emotionless face. And similarly to The Machinist, Christian Bale truly embraced Patrick's character and embodied the character. His performance in this movie was so convincing and powerful that I will never forget it. Christian Bale once again demonstrates his dedication and commitment to make the movie a success. Judging from his amazing physique and great body shape, he must have did rigorous and extensive training. While for The Machinist, he did the exact opposite, losing crazy amounts of weight and having the body of a chopstick. I really respect Christian Bale's professionalism as an actor. Coming back to this movie, I think it's smart, hilarious, bloody and thought provoking. The ending really got me guessing whether all of it was real or merely just a fantasy. This movie really sparked my imagination, and there's so many ways I can interpret it. I strongly suggest everyone to go watch it and interpret it for yourself, because this movie is a true gem.",American Psycho

A clockwork Orange, there will be blood, and one film that combines the best elements of both... American Psycho. I am having a very hard time looking where to begin on this, beside the obvious, but I'll leave that for last. The cinematography is subtle and meaningful. The soundtrack is electric and complements the dark comedy incredibly well. All of the performances are great. But the two things that make this great are the satire and Bale as the lead. This film is able to make a mockery of 1980s consumerism and the elite of the world in such a hilarious way that if nothing else, this movie is effectively a parody. But Bale is really the one who ties it all together. Without spoiling anything, he is able to play essentially a new character in every scene, feeling like an alien trying to react to social interactions like a Normal person would, but when you get those quick glimpses into the real Patrick Bateman... oh man.

Based on the controversial best selling novel by Bret Easton Ellis, the movie follows pretty much the same premise as the book.  Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a poster boy for the eighties.  He wears expensive suits.  Eats extravagant meals of swordfish meatloaf.  Has an apartment overlooking the park. However something is missing in his life. To fill the void, Bateman takes up perverse sexual practices and even resorts to killing total stranger and personal associates.  Even after all the blood is absorbed into the urine soaked concrete of the Manhattan sidewalks, Bateman is still unhappy.  What even makes it worse is that no one seems to notice.Christian Bale is flawless in a role that few people lined up to play.  His performance in this movie has given the Oscar race a good jumpstart which barring any unseen potholes should continue right up until nominations.`American Psycho' delivers its share of problems as well.  Script holes tend to tatter it throughout its screen time and thought the movie, the dialog seems to be improvised rather than scripted.  In a movie of this subject matter, lines should flow as smooth or perhaps even smoother than silk.

664,Dean Snow,Brilliant (this may contain spoilers),9,14 April 2000,"This review contains spoilers for the following films: American Psycho (well, obviously), Fight Club, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I also ask you to please excuse my primitive spelling, I try to make it up by using over-exuberant vocabulary and syntax.American Psycho was incredible.  I really do not need to go into how great a satire it is because you probably already know it is.Let's get the numerical/star grading out of the way right now.  ***1/2 out of **** or 9 out of 10.What I am here to talk about is how many similarities there are to this and Fight Club.  I felt that Fight Club was one of last year's best pictures, number two on my list, only exeeded by Boys Don't Cry.  American Psycho is the tale of a man who is laughed and and not appreciated by most of his colleagues.  He is called a ""dork"" or something that relates to ""dork"" by many of is superiors and/or co-workers.  When he sees some one that has more than him, he creates a fantasy world where he murders these over-achivers in a very sadistic and depraved manner.  Fight Club is the tale of a man who is leading a very mundane existance, and being look at as a peon by many of the people he is surrounded, even himself.  He creates a fantasy world (that eventually merges into the real world) where he can turn his emotional aggressions into physical ones.  I don't mean to go of on a tangent and end up writing a review for Fight Club.  In a word:  American Psycho acts as a more subtle, toned down Fight Club.Also, I might add that there is one scene in which the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is being played on a television.  Later in the film a hooker runs around an apartment seeing what seems to be hundreds of dead bodies as the American Psycho chases after her with-- what else-- than a chainsaw. There appears to be a reference to the Chainsaw Massacre, the scene in which one of the brat-teenagers stumbles into a room filled with human remains, while being chased by Leatherface.

Bale gives a wonderful performance as a man with somewhat of a problem and he is backed with many great supporters.  Also, I felt that Bateman's monologues concerning 80's Adult Contemporary music were priceless.  I was waiting for his thoughts on Benny Mardones' ""Into the Night"" but was too engrossed in the film to miss them.",American Psycho
667,RBongo,Starts Off Very Strong...Then Falls Apart,7,19 April 2000,"I just got back from a screening of the new Mary Harron (I Shot Andy Warhol) film, American Psycho.  I am of mixed feelings when it comes to this film.  I read the novel by Bret Easton Ellis before seeing this film, and I think that potentially changed my final opinion of this film.  So keep that possible bias in your mind while reading this review.When entering this film, I really didn't know what to expect.  I really did enjoy the novel American Psycho and I didn't know how the point of the film could truly be expressed even by Harron, who had done only one feature to this point, although it was an amazing one.  I settled in and began to take it all in.  The film starts of with a relatively humorous tone...very light compared to the novel's strait-laced opening.  It basically introduces Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) as your everyday-high-end-yuppie-who-kills-people-on-the-side kinda guy.  It lets us get acquainted with Bateman's friends, loves, and co-workers as well.  Not too far into the film though, it begins it's slight descension into surreality and nightmarish scenes (don't worry though, the violence in the film is a mere shell of the over-the-top-near-unfilmable violence in the novel, in fact nearly all the violence happens off screen.  Toward the beginning of slide, the film keeps up it's satirical and very humorous look...then it becomes more dark and takes a more serious look at the goings on.  By the end, the viewer has lost touch with what is real in the film and very confused about what to feel for Bateman.I think that the most impressive thing about the film is the combination of the lead performance and the cinematography in the film. Christian Bale, as Patrick Bateman, is amazingly great.  It is one of the most oddball performances I have seen, but it is also the most outstanding I have seen as well.  The fluctuation between outright insanity to social restraint, with a melange of emotions in there, is quite simply remarkable. Now none of the other performances merit as much acclaim.  William Defoe as Detective Donald Kimble,following Bateman's case, also registers to a lesser extent in a subtle performance that is the closest the film has to a real person.  Chloe Sevigny has a role that some found impressive, but I find just lacking all around.  Ditto for Jared Leto and Reese Witherspoon who barely register in basically cameo length roles.The other aspect of the film that really got me was the cinematography of American Psycho.  The lighting cast upon Patrick gives him ""split-faces"", kinda like Jeckyll and Hyde syndrome.  In addition there are just peculiar, but catching scenes of cinematography..such as noir-ish looking cigarette smoke hanging in the air and various camera angles that just lend themselves to the feeling in the film.  The direction on the other hand wasn't nearly as impressive.  It seems as though Harron knows what to do to convey the feeling of the book for like the first 45 minutes, but then it spirals out of control, becoming a (too) dark fall of a yuppie.  It doesn't help that the pacing toward the last 30 minutes is completely off...there is about 15 minutes of monologues about Bateman's flaws, then a horrific murder scene, then close with another 15 minutes of dialogue.  The screenplay, while the pacing was off...the reason why the film's pacing was off, does really do the best possible job of getting the point of the book across, and comes very close to pinning down the exact feeling of the book, except for the self-indulgent finale.Overall, I would say that it is a film that you could probably wait for video or DVD.  But if you are a fanatic of ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" or of the book American Psycho, try to make out to the theatre as soon as possible.My Rating : 7/10",American Psycho

670,aayvns,to clear a few things up...,9,14 January 2002,"There seem to be two types of opinions on this movie, comments from those who understand it which are usually very positive, and comments from those who don't understand it, who give it poor reviews. Despite what some people seem to think, this is not a slasher horror movie, nor does it deal with split-realities as one person wrote. It is a satirical and humourous look at the yuppie culture of the 80's, through the eyes of a psychopath.To explain the film, and those who have not yet seen it should look away now, Patrick Bateman is a yuppie loser who fantasises about being a serial killer, however he does not actually kill anyone. He lives out his fantasies through drawings in a book, and he actually believes he is killing people. The key evidence of this is not only the ending but when Bateman wants to kill people but is unable to do so, as in the case of the guy who has a crush on him and his secretary. When he is actually faced with the prospect of a real murder he is not capable of doing it.Once this is understood it is far easier to appreciate this movie for the masterpiece that it is, unquestionably one of the top ten movies of all time.",American Psycho
671,tha_kiwibird,Brilliant movie,8,17 June 2007,"Brilliant Movie, Fantastic atmosphere and acting and surprising plot. Christian Bale really puts down a good psychopath, sometimes in an extreme way, but in most scenes quite subtle. I am usually not a fan of movies like these (the gory and bloody scenes are usually a sign of bad B-movies) but this one is really worth watching.It's not real ""heavy"" horror, there might be ""thrills"" for some people in it (dead bodies and such) but you won't see things like a ghost popping up out of nowhere screaming to scare the audience like in many cheap horror movies. In fact some scenes, which in essence should be ""horror"" are quite hilarious (referring to, for example, a certain scene with a chainsaw) and make the movie as a whole a bit lighter than it could have been.However, if you see this movie and hope to see another great movie by watching part 2: don't. Trust me, it will be a true disappointment. Instead, I advise you to watch the TV series Dexter (as in the Dexter the serial killer, not the cartoon Dexter's Lab) since it catches the atmosphere a lot better.",American Psycho
672,gusdanjaq,I am just not there,9,18 March 2010,"American Psycho is one of those movies that will leave the critics divided. Is a kind of movie that if you don't get the point of what's going on you are just going to think about it as an awful mess. I got the point ( i mean i read Bret Easton Ellis's book, but i read it long after i watched and loved the movie) and i loved it. Christian Bale (who i might say is one of the best, if not the best, actors currently working) does a great job playing socialite Patrick Bateman, who's only obsessions in life are taking extremely good care of himself (using a large variety of beauty products, obsessively working out, etc.), going to the bests night clubs and restaurants, and last but not least, satisfying his increasing homicidal impulses. In fact early in the movie we see that Patrick Bateman isn't at all how he wants to be seen by his peers (he is shown as a charming stock broker who has friends and a girlfriend), in fact he is an increasingly psychotic homicidal man who is so bored with his yuppie lifestyle that the only way he feels alive and really feels in touch with the world that surrounds him is by engaging in disturbing and gruesome murders. The worst part is that even with his increasingly chaotic and erratic behavior, he seems more aware about the disconnection from humanity that this yuppie lifestyle gives to the people in it than his peers (theres is a scene in which Patrick and his friends are literally drooling over some presentation cards). I don't think that Harron's approach to the story is at all perfect (having already read the book), and as i said is a pretty tough story to understand. But in her defense, one of the greatest things of a story like American psycho is that you have to keep an open mind to see beyond the violence and the massacres, which also happens while reading the book. As i said Bale's performance is just plain excellent, it might seem over the top sometimes, but believe me, thats Patrick Bateman: a man constantly over the edge of psychotic boredom who could snap at any moment. The funny thing is that their co-workers are so clueless about everything and so self-centered that they don't seem to realize the homicidal maniac they have next door (not even by the fact Patrick sometimes playfully confesses his urges to them). Bale deserved at least Oscar buzz for this role, he is just plain perfect. As a side note, i hope Hollywood starts rewarding him for his carefully methodical performances or he could easily become the next Jeff bridges (a great actor whose every performances are nearly flawless but doesn't get the recognition he deserves): i know Bridges won the Oscar this year, but it was long overdue. The supporting cast is very good too. By playing clueless and self centered characters the wrong actor might look stiff, but the cast does a great job with their roles. Chloe Sevigny, willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas,.. All the cast do a great job with their respective roles. All in all is a great movie, and one of my all time favorites. Is the kind of movie in which with every new viewing you start noticing new elements and themes that are being developed and satirized. Great Performances, Extremely great cult classic.",American Psycho

Great plot, great drama, great actors, great filming.The sequence of shots, centralize around Patrick's madness and how it begins to suddenly overtake his life.  The killings start and don't stop, only seem to become more quantitive (more blanket of death within one swoop, so to speak).  This may seem to look the movie as boring, but it is well done, while this is happening, we see possibilities of Patrick's madness but never really tell.  We observe his behavior, and the one's around him.  Christian Bale did an excellent job!",American Psycho
674,TheHip14,"Great film, great satire.",9,7 August 2005,"American Psycho is an amazing movie. It is a brilliant satire. The acting is amazing especially by Christian Bale. When you strip this movie down it is not about a serial killer. The movie has a much different and deeper meaning. In American Psycho, the dark 80's satire the message is very clear. In the 80's all the Wall Street Yuppies are the same. They only care about themselves. They all want to be perfect. Since none of them present their own personalities it is hard to distinguish them. This is why everyone confuses everyone else for other people. These people aren't all friends. They are all just using each other to get ahead. Patrick Bateman does not even know who he is. He questions his very existence. That is the first aspect of this film. The second thing is Patrick Bateman did indeed commit the murders. The only person who remotely cared about the murders was Detective Kimball. All of Patrick's friend's alibis said that he was there when in fact he wasn't. This is another example of mistaken identity. Nobody seems to care that Patrick murders. He makes it so clear to everyone but they are all just so occupied with their own lives that they don't care. At its core this movie is very similar to Wall Street. The point of this film isn't to show a serial killer killing people. It is to show that in the 80's on Wall Street most people were just obsessed with getting ahead and they didn't care about anything else. Patrick is just so annoyed with this normal lifestyle that he goes absolutely crazy and starts killing people. He already had problems to begin withyet a few things trigger him off and he goes crazy. He murders people because he wants to do something different he wants to be different from everyone else. Everyone he knows is the same type of person. That is the reason for all the mistaken identities. Although when no once even acknowledges his murders it drives him more crazy. This is why at the end he says "" My punishment has eluded me"" meaning his punishment escapes him. He will never be punished because no one really acknowledged that he killed these people. Then he says ""My confession has meant nothing"" meaning his confession didn't mean anything because no one cared. Well anyways I think I got the meaning of this movie right. I loved this movie. The acting is incredible. Especially Christian Bale.",American Psycho
675,phillips-adl,This is truly excellent,10,24 January 2015,"One of my favourite films ever. I'm coming back to review this more out of respect than anything else as I really enjoyed this film. It's a crazed, cynical look inside the mind of a seemingly regular member of the City elite and shows just how depraved human beings can be if we strip back the societal construct. More importantly, it's actually really funny in a lot of parts as well and overall a lot of fun to watch. Christian Bale was born to play this role in my opinion. He 'is' American Psycho and does it so well. This and Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and you've got four of the films in my top ten. The dialogue is brilliant, it's shot incredibly well and although I have to admit to having never read the book (and in a way don't want to now for fear of changing the 'feel' of it) I can say that everyone should try this film. Sheer excellence.",American Psycho
676,irish_psycho,Impressive to say the least,9,17 November 2004,"Impressed is the best way I can sum this movie up. In this movie we get a somewhat disturbing insight into the life of Pat Bateman a successful 27 year old living in 80's New York City. By day he works on Wall Street, only cares about himself and lives the yuppie lifestyle. His only interests are to look good and be on top of the social ladder. By night he is quite a different character, hooking up with prostitutes, killing and mutilating people. The whole film centers on Bateman who is perfectly played by Christian Bale and is looked at through his eyes with narration for most of the film by himself.Direction is excellent by Mary Harron who captures the character of Pat Bateman excellently from the one depicted in the book.I never really realized the concept of a black comedy until I saw this. Some of the scenes are quite graphic in nature depicting horrible things to people but yet you still find yourself laughing at it. You may think am I a psycho laughing at this kind of stuff but then you realize its OK as the way it is presented is humorous.For materialistic people you will find a close connection with Bateman and all will most likely laugh till your hearts content from start to finish. In addition I would also recommend the book to anyone who enjoys the film as it expands the story a little more but not essential as the film stands great on its own. I actually saw the film before reading the book.This film isn't obviously for everyone but if you liked 'The Last Supper' this should be a safe bet to watch and enjoy.Excellent 9* out of 10",American Psycho

I have to say that the film is underrated , it was a success but not on the level that it clearly stands, this should have been a huge blockbuster. The acting in the film is excellent, Christian Bale is a superb actor thats unquestionable, but in American Psycho he truly delivers a portrait and his acting is 2nd to none.

678,Ryan_V,"The ""Our Little Secret"" for Guys Film",9,6 October 2005,"""My name is Patrick Bateman. I am twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh floor..."" Patrick Bateman establishes his persona quickly: cold; cynical; emotionless; self-involved - a raging Larry David. Based on Bret Easton Ellis' late 80's fictional book, ""American Psycho"", the story was rewritten for the screen, and deviates at times. Patrick might be said to be an image of Bret, a reflection of an over-obsessed materialistic metro-sexual with a grumble for blood and the suffering of others.""My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy."" Is Patrick akin to our true-selves, in the Freudian sense? Is the attraction to his character due to the envy of his ability to cathartically release his daily fits of rage upon those around him? Perhaps the film is therapeutic in this way, as we live out our logically constructed fantasies through Patrick. But are any of Patrick's ""wrongdoings"" real? The question is left with the viewer, in that reality must be measured against psychological defense mechanisms.But Patrick, whether actually or artificially, lets his emotions flow, and the film gives a superb, terse yet detailed snapshot of this process. Some may disagree, and the film has had mixed reviews, yet, the movie is a final statement. An ode to metro-sexual men, spawning their veil of ignorance during the latter 80's. It gives to us a view of ourselves which touches upon the incredibly competitive aspects of society, and the way it reveals itself, even subtly.Patrick and his clan, Wallstreet brokers, busy themselves with details like the font on their business cards, Oliver People glasses, restaurants, etc. They are all narcissists living empty lives, filling the void with belongings and good looks. They struggle, unprepared, with their ""new"" material desires: in Patrick's case, they overflow. They hate each other, and have perhaps no direction. Fashioned with a strong story and fine acting, alongside its take on a phenomena just surfacing in the time it was depicted, this film is a milestone both cinematically and, as one of the few mainstream American films to take seriously mans transition from the traditional roles they subscribed to in the 50's-70's. It is recommended, if not for the feeling of a release on society, but for a look at what first generation metro-sexuals were like in their niche.",American Psycho

And certain parts of the movie were better than the book. I like the way the way Mary Harron took out a lot of the gore and made it more satirical sounding than the book did (you have to really think about the book to realize that it is a satire, while the movie made it obvious). For example, in the book Patrick Bateman talks about music that he loves in chapters that are seemingly just thrown into the book, while the movie makes them integral parts of certain scenes. Also, the fact reminds that this movie is pro-feminist, regardless of what has been written about it. Mary Harron, the director is mocking the way men act, and seems to say that homicidal rag is something more men would turn to if given the chance. While I don't recommend this movie for everyone, it is is still a very solid movie. Christian Bale is spectacular, Reese Weatherspoon plays her role well and Matt Ross is excellent as well.

692,lanceaugust1,Frightening and fascinating,7,31 May 2019,"This is hard to watch at times. Patrick Bateman's cruelty is what is at issue: how is it motivated, from whence does it come, is it in everyone? At times this film seems to suggest that the unrestrained mayhem and viciousness displayed by the main character are present in all humans; and the social masks we wear are merely thin disguises for the aggression, greed, and cruelty which operate below the surface. The movie presents society as a tightly rehearsed dance of protocol, virtue signaling, discreet conformity to social norms. In one scene characters display business cards with subtle differences in what appears to be a critique of how restrictive society is that the only thing left to choice, the only mode of self expression is a water mark on a card, or raised lettering. When Patrick Bateman snaps it is a horror show of epic proportions. This is not easy material to render and the director deserves a lot of credit. Sexuality is presented as naked aggression, animal-level conduct divorced from sincere emotion or communication. Characters in this movie exist in profound isolation, unaware of their motives, operating at a level of seeking or maintaining status. If a darker vision of modern society exists on film I am not aware of it. Even Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' had a few moments of familial contentment, and an expression of love, which you won't find here. Not to suggest this movie needs any of that. It is a psychological study, a dark one at that; and if you are inclined to ponder the depths of what is inside the human animal this movie is ""food for thought.""",American Psycho

694,writ74,"Paced excruciatingly slow, American Psycho fails on all levels",2,19 September 2000,"When I read this book in the mid-eighties, one of the most interesting aspects of it was its listing of the items that seemed to intrigue the consumerism aspects of the yuppie's soul.  Sure the book was horrificly violent as it followed Patrick Bateman on his random acts of homicidal violence, but it was a quick read--thought provoking, disturbing and over soon.  Many hated the literary qualities of the book as the prose was based on a shopping list quality that I thought made the book even more intriguing.  The movie starts off interesting as Bateman, played by Christian Bale, who should win an Oscar for overacting, tells the viewer of his facial cleansing regime and I'm thinking this is going to be pretty good.  But that's where the fun ends and the movie begins simply following Bateman from one grisly incident to another.  Problem with this is these scenes are not interesting.  They show us nothing about the soul of Bateman and seem intended as nothing more than shock value.  The premise of the book which was the utter shallowness of yuppie consumerism has been lost.Not only is the film painfully slow, it is dull to the point that I was glancing at the clock every ten minutes.  I soon realized that director Mary Harron's film is not an interesting piece about one man's utter descent into madness, glazed over with his yuppie pretensions, but a film about a killer that offers the viewer nothing more than your average slasher film.  At least your average slasher film has some suspense where Harron's film has none of that.

The movie revolves around his killer tendecies to show the true meaning of what it is to be normal. As everyone fades away to being normal, Bateman is the only one with common sense.

I'm not saying it's good, or bad, I'm just saying that there are alot of things that you miss out on understanding if you haven't read the book.  Just like the book, the atmosphere of intensity in certain situations is amplified to a drastically hopeless decibal.  The most interesting scene is the shooting rampage towards the end.  This movie is not really a horror movie, or even a thriller, in a way it is a satire.  The author Brett Easton Ellis satires just about everything.  The ending to this movie is played off of a certain interpretation of the book, though you probably got the ending in the movie it is much more difficult to understand the ending of the book.  In the book it is left very vague, like shakespeares play Hamlet, it's left open to a dozen philosophies.  It's up to you which one you choose.  Christian Bale was perfect for the role he was in, it was very specified in the book that Patrick Bateman is supposed to be a handsome, classy character who reads the Gentleman's Quarterly (GQ) on a very regular basis.  Patrick Bateman was believable as that figure.  One thing I must specify on, In the wicked magazine some guy left a comment saying that Christian Bale was no good for the role, he was too soft looking.  Well, that was the whole point, Patrick Bateman is not like Joe Spinnell in Maniac, though some of his actions are similar.  Patrick Bateman is everything you look for in a guy, extremely wealthy, ambitious, intelligent, polished, tasteful, good looking, etc. He is not someone who you develop fear for, and that's the irony, because underneath all that he is an all American psycho!",American Psycho
701,bobniche,Brutally funny but something's missing,7,25 May 2001,America Psycho is a good satire of 80s culture; taking shots at everything from yuppies to music to politics. And it is pretty damn funny at it as well. Christian Bale is perfect as the somewhat unhinged Patrick Bateman and is suitably OTT. His analysis of his CD collection is hilarious.However the film does have its flaws. For one thing the plot is a little thin and the whole affair runs out of steam towards the disappointing ending. Also the supporting cast although stellar on paper seem almost anonymous as they drift in and out of the story.American Psycho is cool and sleek with Bale in a killer role but falls just short of a perfect translation of very difficult material. Recommended.,American Psycho
702,labolabo,Very overrated,3,9 May 2007,"I have just, for the third time, tried to watch more than just 15-30 minutes of this movie, without succeeding this time neither. Actually, I think it's a boring and exaggerated and unrealistic movie in many ways. Poor direction, poor acting (including the lead role), and disturbingly high (although quite good) music. I have nothing against movies about psychopaths or serial killers (like ""Henry, portrait of a serial killer""), but this movie just seems so very shallow and bad. I can't even see what's good in it. Why not instead create a more realistic movie? (English is not my native language so apologies for writing errors.)",American Psycho

709,irishguy122,Watered Down,7,10 June 2012,"Of course, when watching the movie it is almost unavoidable that you compare it to Bret Easton Ellis's classic novel of the same name. Having been truly horrified by the disturbing yet entrancing mind of Bateman in the book, I watched the movie expecting incredible things. Somehow, in an intangible way, the movie just didn't sit well with me. As an individual film, it can claim to be something of a flawed masterpiece, a dive into the deep end of the human psyche and the nature of morality. Add in a dash of the theme of empty materialism, and you have a movie that should not soon be forgotten. A memorable performance from Bale, as he flies between flamboyant charmer to dead eyed murderer and everything in between, I don't think another actor could have done a better job. Add a slew of great supporting actors, including a surprisingly decent turn from Jared Leto (whom I normally avoid at all costs)and you have the makings of a classic. However, the movies somehow just can't live up the mastery of the novel, and the seemingly random switches between Bateman's abstract thoughts and his terrifyingly intimate descriptions of his murders just don't seem to flow here. Also, the movie never lived up to the true disgust created in the novel.",American Psycho

All I knew was that I wanted to immediately watch it again. Christian Bale's performance is one that makes you wonder if any other actor would have done the role justice, as with Malcolm McDowell in Clockwork Orange or Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York. He delivers every line in a way which makes every second of the movie so enjoyable to watch. I have to credit the screenplay though with giving Bale incredible line after line. The ending is the biggest complaint for this movie but even if you hate the ending the other 96 minutes of pure enjoyment should out weigh the 45 seconds of ending.

And I love having that thought ending the movie. I don't think they should have added the scenes where he killed the rest of the people, it's unnecessary.

712,lars-chr-lund,A Piece Of Art In An Ocean Of Cinema,10,25 February 2016,"!POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!I want to start off by saying that this is one of my all-time favorite movies. I could watch it for days on end and it would never seize to amaze me.The following text is an internal discussion about the idea and actual meaning of the film, and i'm posting it here because i think many fans will appreciate this point of view. For me, this movie is truly a work of art..PS: The initial scene in question for the following conclusion is the fact that nobody seems to recognize Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) no matter the setting, this occurs in scattered moments throughout the movie, but the topic of discussion is the fact that Harold (Batemans lawyer) doesn't - even after Patrick Bateman clearly testifies to committing all of the murders in the movie, over the telephone.:The Idea:""""Patrick Bateman does not exist physically but rather is the narrative occupying the minds of all the characters we see and this is eluded to numerous times. The opening dialog itself states ""I simply am not there"" which was timed so it's said when he peels off the mask. The entire dialog once the mask has dried eludes to his lack of physical existence and being the ""spirit"" that occupies all of these people. He's talking about the emptiness inside these people he represents and the elitist vanities they use to try to fill them and justify their despicable personalities. The Bateman is used as a scapegoat or mirror image, but he simply doesn't exist physically. When his secretary says ""thanks Patrick"" he says ""I'm not here"".Even the friends of Bateman humiliate him and in the beginning they don't even know which man is Paul Allen. When we see this person, whoever he is, he is drinking himself into an early grave.Notice the head is there as a projection? It could actually be anybody sitting there but it's The Bateman driving him to sleep with his coworker's fiancé. The spirit of The Bateman.Bateman telling people what to do, what he thinks, the standards he sets etc. is the inner voice driving all of these people and sometimes it's internal and other times it's external but we see him as Davis who really exists or Allen who really exists when they are all being The Bateman. Get it? He is the manifestation of consumerism, materialism, capitalism, the greed and lust of the supercharged society they all live in. You notice in conversations everyone centers around him, praises him, seek his approval?Every emotion he describes is a reflection of every character in the movie right down to the murders but they leave out the ""if I could get away with it"". There's copious amounts of evidence validating what I'm saying. There's at least one example in every scene that verifies what I'm saying.Not only is there no Patrick Bateman but the physical character we are following doesn't exist. If however, you watch it a few times in a row you can see Patrick Bateman's physical existence represents many things not just thoughts or actual people. Sometimes someone shows up and we see an opportunity to accept this theory as the Bateman unleashed was in fact Victoria's inner Bateman. We are seeing The Bateman inside of everyone. We are watching a movie about all the secondary characters who are in fact the leads but only when they are being The Bateman.Of course the one last concept is indeed Bateman exists as a Phantom and passes from body to body.It's as close to art as film making can ever get and one of the few films out of hundreds of thousands that deserves to be called art.""""I hope this fascinated some of you..",American Psycho

There are lots of scenes in the film that are very tame compared to the book, I read the book a few years earlier and it is..... terrifying, scary, macabre!! The film has a softer edge, with a lot of the violence from the book not used in the film it makes me wonder if a German or other European filmmaker made it would it be more true to the book? When it comes to the end of the film and he has committed all these murders you want there to be a great ending, which it doesn't quite have.

The Patrick Bateman character is very interesting, as he is probably the most self absorbed main character in the history of film. He feels he's the most refined and among the greatest of all intellectuals. And perhaps he is 90% of the time. The other 10% he's cutting it up, so to speak. (In this case, literally)  There's a lot of dark and subtle humor here that might not appeal to some, but I think it's a nice effort, and it's a part of my DVD library.Rating:    8/10  great dark humor with some bloodshed.

I heard one guy on the way out shout, ""This sucks!!! I'm getting a refund!"" That was funny.The movie, to me, seemed really awkward.  In certain areas it was hard to keep from laughing, so I cut loose and found the rest of the audience start to laugh.The script, however, did bring up interesting social pressures that high powered office holding men go through.peace out I gave it a 2, but that is my opinion you might find otherwise.",American Psycho

Or, a person could sit there dumbfounded for the first half of the movie until they get tired of trying to figure out what the point of it is, and leave to go get some take-out and go watch something good on TV.  I mean, seriously, this may be an attempt to twist our minds and shock us, but there are waaaay better movies a person can rent for that. The movie had very little plot, Bateman's evolving dementia was hardly believable, and the constant mention of ""Restaurant Reservations"" as the definitive status symbol for the 80's businessman was over-killed in the first 10 minutes.  If you really want to see this movie, wait for the VHS, or better yet, the DVD, which I'm sure will be marketed with some sort of ""Extra Uncut Footage"" or ""Special Edition"" packaging for an extra $10.",American Psycho
723,kgpittm,First MST3K Worthy Movie of 2000,1,12 April 2000,"Plainly put, this movie was horrible.  The attempt to satirize the greed of the 80's was neither original or well done.  What's lacking in this movie? Basically everything, but here's a quick outline:Plot- Obviously the directors found no need for a plot to be included in this movie.Acting- Bale will win an award for this one, I do agree.  But saying it will be an Oscar is absurd.  The only award he's going to win for this is a Razzie (Worst job of acting for the Year). Also, the movie as whole (assuming no other movie can equal it this year) should do at the Razzie's what American Beauty and Matrix combined did at the Oscar's.  The casting and acting for the other characters was horrible, but then again they weren't given much to work with.Comedy- The only thing they semi-succeeded with was comedy in the movie, but not for the reasons they hoped.  While we were supposed to laugh at the depraved nature of the greedy man of the 80's, I instead found myself and the other 300 in the theater that didn't leave half way through (which about 100 did) laughing at how stupid the things he did were (beyond psychotic) and how useless many of the sex scenes, dialogue, etc. were.Ending- Like plot, the directors found having an ending unnecessary.  I stayed in the theater (prescreen for University students) because I figured it would have a decent ending that might make me think and make the movie bearable.  Wishful thinking.In summary, don't waste your money or your time on this movie in the regular or dollar theaters.  Once it gets past those in a month, don't rent it either.  Don't even watch it for free on HBO... your time has to be worth more than that.  Watch the cartoon network or dumbo or something.  The only time this movie might be worth watching is once the producers of Mystery Science Theater 3000 get their hands on it and make fun of it (see the worst 100 movies on IMDb for examples of how MST3K can make bad movies bearable). However, this movie is so grotesque at points, they probably can't show it on cable.  It's the Devil's Advocate with more useless sex and absolutely no plot.",American Psycho
724,satellite79,All the things that make a story great,8,14 April 2000,"In the reviews that I have read on this film already, one thing is for certain: people are either going to hate or love this movie. I fall into the latter category.Let me make it clear that I have not read the book. I feel at a disadvantage, because the book would obviously offer more insight into the mind of Patrick Bateman. However, this is the impression that I received from the movie.I found that the plot and dialogue was very rich in satire and irony. I saw the movie a certain way through most of the film, finding my self sympathetic toward the character of Bateman. And then, suddenly, the viewpoint changes, and I felt as if I had been completely led astray to consider the actual content of the plot.Most people find that the book/film is a comment on our society. I had a different impression. Watching this movie made me consider its face value in depth: a tale of a psychopath, trying to control urges and emotions of greed and disgust because they aren't socially acceptable. Bateman is worried to death about not being assimilated into a society that condemns the kind of person that he is. His murders are fabrications of his mind and a devious plan that can never come to fruition because it will prevent him from living life as a ""normal"" human being. Bateman's internal battle is brought to life majestically on screen. The movie does not go for shock value along the lines of gore and scenes that make the audience shield their eyes in disgust. This works well because the point of the story is reinforced, refusing to be buried under clichés, and is portrayed by scenes of sadistic humour and strong foreshadowing.Great job by all actors concerned, Christian Bale in particular. 8/10",American Psycho
725,UKRipper,"You either get it, or you don't. I got it.",8,3 August 2002,"Try to overlook the gore - it's incidental to the plot. This movie is basically about a superficial, greed orientated society. Bateman's attempts to out do his peers and be noticed and accepted get more and more pathologically brutal and heinous as the story progresses. But, despite his insanity, he's desperate to be caught. The confession at the end which draws total dismissal from his peers, just reiterates the kind of society we're in. 10 out of 10 to Christian Bale for his very convincing performance.",American Psycho

I did not read the novel on which it was based, and I think it does not matter.  Some adaptations are too ""read the novel to understand"", but not this one.

729,movie-monster,'I simply am not there...',10,5 December 2008,"Its interesting that Christian Bale's most critically acclaimed role, in this very movie, is as a cold, psychotic and shallow yuppie. He excels by playing a character who openly admits that his only identifiable emotions are 'greed' and 'disgust'.Firstly, this film should not be misinterpreted as a horror movie. Those who have read the Brett Easton Ellis novel will already be aware of this. It is more a satire, or a harsh and uncompromising commentary on the material excess of Wall Street, or indeed America as a whole (hence the title), during the mid-to-late 80's. It works on both these levels and many more.The film starts as it means to continue. Bale's character, Patrick Bateman, introduces himself, and, as in the novel, goes into absurd detail regarding his washing habits and exercise regimes. For the next hour and a half, the audience is invited into his world. A world in which vanity itself, it seems, is everything. His life is composed almost entirely of expensive meals out with his high-flying friends & disillusioned girlfriend(played adequately by Reese Witherspoon), and various random, sadistic acts of violence and mutilation.Despite all Batemans' wealth, he is emotionally bankrupt. Love and relationships are as disposable as the world he lives in. For the entire film, Bale relishes the role and never lets it slip, talking as if he's in some warped commercial for a shallow and completely hedonistic eighties lifestyle. A lifestyle which leads nowhere. Bateman's character is also loaded with contradictions and hypocrisy. In one of the opening scenes, he wastes no time describing how he believes 'in taking care of himself', but days later will be snorting cocaine in a public toilet. Later, he describes how 'we need to provide food and shelter for the homeless', which is delivered as a speech to seemingly promote Bateman's morality in front of his peers. Shortly afterwards, he stabs a tramp to death in an alleyway. This speech acts as an omen or as a warning to crimes he will commit, or will imagine committing later in the film. His references to women in particular, soon become disturbingly ironic.Authenticity is added to the movie in the form of music and reference to the AIDS epidemic, which was just starting to take hold of the American consciousness. Bateman's highly unstable and vacuous state of mind is relayed through several brilliant quotes and scenes in the movie.One example is the scene in which he examines his colleagues business cards in depth, and becomes so obsessed and frustrated by the minor differences in colour and font that his hand visibly shakes. Upon seeing Paul Allen's card he whispers to himself in genuine horror; 'oh my god...it even has a watermark.' In Bateman's world, this could well be interpreted as the reasoning behind him murdering Allen later in the film.Much of the movie is left open to interpretation by the viewer, and it should definitely be watched several times. Its often hard to draw the line between reality and Bateman's own fantasies. Indeed many, if not all, of his murderous acts, could be simply figments of his own twisted imagination. The character Donald Kimble could indeed be an illusion. He interviews Bateman several times in the movie, at times appearing oblivious to the possibility of Bateman murdering Allen, and then later effectively accusing him of it.What the film really illustrates, much like the book, is a culture and an entire way-of-life, taken too a brutal, disturbed, and even demented extreme. It is a fusion of America's most beautiful dream, and its most hideous, blood-soaked nightmare. Money is no longer a barrier for Bateman. He can have all the women, sex, narcotics, technology and expensive meals he will ever desire. There is nothing left for him or his friends to aspire too. When every line has been crossed on a daily basis, he can only find satisfaction in the most depraved and barbaric of acts, and in the end, even this isn't enough.While the book is considerably more graphic and detailed, I would have to say I prefer the film. All the important and relevant aspects of Bateman's life and psyche are featured and Bale's performance elevates it to true 'cult classic' status. His portrayal of Bateman creates, in my opinion, one of the most vivid, cruel, iconic and unforgettable characters in the history of film.",American Psycho

You should watch it a couple of times - it will get funnier (as well as make you think a lot) as you do... particularly the ending.",American Psycho
735,Stalina,Another way of reading the novel,7,11 May 2002,"Regardless of all the controversy, I just loved and love Brett Easton Ellis' novel. I thought and think it's a bold, challenging and tremendously original work and not just anyone can fully appreciate all the dark humour and despair beneath the gory surface.The film adaptation shows the depths of the novel refraining from its cruelty. Even though it boasts some shocking scenes (ie the chainsaw) the nature of the impact is mainly psychological and relies very much on the impressive performance by Christian Bale, once again proving the wonderful actor he is. Rather than being dark and ambiguous with respect to the main character, Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have chosen to look at him from outside thus exposing his pathetism and twisted sense of reality, therefore avoiding any chance of glamorisation of the character, and the film is constantly mocking his yuppie macho conceit, something the novel left the reader to do him/herself. Also, it deserves to be noted that the film is much more woman-friendly than the novel could possibly ever be, most female characters (including the melancholy Courtney) being sympathetic. There is no scope for mysoginy here.To sum up, this is a more accesible, much less ambiguous approach to a difficult character. While the novel is fascinating because it constantly pushes you to new limits as a reader, the film becomes a highly witty parody of it all. A bit more of social criticism is missing in this adaptation but however thumbs up to Harron for her feminist way of treating an unbearably ridiculous mysoginist lunatic.",American Psycho
736,illk9,Excellent Psycho Movie!! Excellent!!,9,3 December 2007,"This movie is superb in so many ways. It is a must see for a lover of psycho movies as far as I'm concerned. You follow a man through a dark and disturbed series of events in which he shows no remorse. Also being a true serial killer his victims have very little in common. The only thing in common with some of them is the killer himself. In many cases there is no rhyme or reason for his victim's demise other than his personal pleasure.He clearly has a competitive side which comes out several times, but once in particular when he is comparing business cards with colleagues. They are in public and clearly he can't stand and nearly can't cope with the outcome of the business card comparison. However in private Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is always in control. He has a very authoritative demeanor just before he kills and makes it look like a party. As if this would be a great time or a fantastic way to plan a weekend.The movie has an excellent ending as well. Not your typical good guys win bad guys lose fantasy movie. I don't want to give anything away but I was pleasantly surprised it didn't have a fairytale ending. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a suspenseful, dark, disturbing, and violently bloody good time.",American Psycho
737,jamesblond,Overrated is an understatement!,1,14 May 2014,"This might just be the most overrated film I have ever seen in my entire life. I am trying to think of something this tedious -- oh wait, Synecdoche. That was worse. But I actually think that the secret to that film was that the only way to understand it was to reject its abysmal navel-gazing and walk out of it. Which I did. And if you sat and watched to the end, you didn't get it. So in that bit of turnabout, that film earned its ticket price. This had no redeeming value that I could see. The one positive thing I can say about this is that I find Christian Bale's weird, stiff inability to act grating in pretty much every film I have seen him in, so maybe if they had hired someone else, this movie wouldn't have sucked such gangrenous boils. But I just don't get what's interesting about this film that these other people see. Smug finance exec is going crazy, feels entitled, acts like a dick, has murderous fantasies, thinks he's funny but isn't. And? Oh, ha, ha, he's into his body and does crunches and obsesses on his skincare regiment. And? I gave it a 1.",American Psycho
738,alan_taylor69,"great film, ambiguous ending",10,24 January 2002,"This has been a favourite of mine for a while.  Ever since reading the book in 1999, I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of this picture and I must say I was in no way disappointed.  There were many names thrown around for the role of Patrick Bateman; and I must say if Leonardo DiCaprio had have got the part as originally intended, I may have had to boycott the film!  Don't get me wrong, as pretty boy Romeo, or a similar role in Titanic as Jack, that is fine.  But this role required a strong performance, and that is what it got perfectly in Christian Bale.Bale plays Bateman perfectly.  In fact, better than that, he is Patrick Bateman.  His dry wit, intelligence and also his psychotic side shine through brilliantly.  The supporting cast is equally impressive.  Chloe Sevigny as his lovestruck secretary is fantastic, and William Dafoe as the snooping cop is actually quite unnerving.However, aside from Bale's performance, it is the direction which really carries this movie.  Mary Harron has gone for the approach of 'less is more', merely suggesting gruesome acts of violence as opposed to showing them.What causes some confusion with this film is the ending.  I must say that it is open to individual interpretation, but I have my own theory.  Bateman actually did carry out the murders, but this , like anything, was hidden behind a good reputation and money.  The estate agent at the end tells him just to leave because they have disposed of the bodies, as if the true story had been made public, then the value of the property would have plummeted. Hell, he had been confused as Halberstram a few times, so his attorney had mistaken someone for Paul Owen, when he said he had lunch with him.But that is just my theory, and it is one of the things that makes this movie so great, the chance to draw your own conclusions.
I recommend this movie to anyone interested in an intelligent, absorbing story which is made believable and all the more terrifying by terrific performances and faultless direction.9.5/10 (no movie is perfect!)",American Psycho
739,liuruiorp,'My confession has meant nothing',8,30 July 2011,"A lot of the reviews have focused on the plot on a straightforward basis, but American Psycho is not just a dark comedy or a B movie slasher, but rather an allegory for the negativities of capitalism. Patrick Bateman struggles to convince his own lawyer he had committed the killings the audience had seen him commit earlier in the film. There are various reasons why this is and neither Bret Easton Ellis in the novel or Mary Harron in the film rules decisively on which. One is that in this convincingly believable 80s NYC yuppie world, people have become so interchangeable that Bateman can kill countless numbers of people without anybody realising, because everyone is so generic. Hence why one of his victims mistake him for a co-worker, and why everyone Bateman knows seems to be Vice-President at Pierce & Pierce, and why the detective and his lawyer thinks his victim, Paul Allen, is alive and in London. Another possible reason is that people know he has killed people and they simply don't care, because the lives of others don't matter. As Bateman says while he is analysing Whitney Houston,'in this world where it's hard to empathise with others, we can above all empathise with ourselves'. Taken from this viewpoint, the story is an allegory for how the actions of American governments and corporations cause famine and war around the world that result in real world deaths, but we brush them off because it means we in the West can have cheap clothes, food and petrol. A final interpretation I will offer is that Bateman has fantasised all these killings. In this interpretation Bateman is the victim. His life has become so boring and formulaic, with endless dinners at overpriced, gaudy restaurants, endless discussions about style and beauty tips, that the only way he can feel human is to fantasise about the most brutal and sadistic acts possible. This interpretation is given credence by the cartoonish violence in his final rampage and of course the ending.",American Psycho

This movie is one of those films where you watch it again and notice something different every time. Not only is it an amazing story but it's filmed and acted to absolute perfection. Christian Bale delivers his greatest performance to date {at least in my mind} in this creepy and yet intriguing drama / horror. By day he is Patrick Batemen, successful and influential business man but by night, he is a complete American Psycho! The beauty of the film lies in the set dressing / locations and the way the story is told. I'm not sure who directed this but he /she is an absolute GENIUS! This movie allowed me to rediscover Christian bale after seeing reign of fire, which was terrible. This movie is worth the buy!",American Psycho
741,mikemoto1,Disappointing Adaptation of Ellis Novel,5,13 July 2003,"Frankly, I am quite surprised that as many people liked this film on here as they did. I had read the Ellis novel about 6 years before the movie came out and frankly, I was greatly disappointed by this portrayal. Could somebody please tell me why certain character's names were changed. For example it is PAUL OWEN in the book, not PAUL ALLEN as it is here. Is this some sort of subconscious dig at Microsoft? Also, some of the violent scenes in the book that were the most powerful, such as when Bateman attacks the guy delivering Chinese Food are completely left out of the film altogether. Please do yourself a favor and read the book instead.",American Psycho
742,scanlon178,Classic,9,27 August 2003,"I've seen American Psycho perhaps 10 times; and it still rules.It's funny, it's cool, and it's got a point to it. I saw it the movies with a couple of mates, and afterwards one goes to me 'so did he really kill all those people or not'? I replied 'it doesn't matter', with a sufficiently cold stare. They thought that was the most psycho line of the night. I was pleased.I tried reading the book but stopped when I realised the guy writing it was essentially, a pretty sick guy. Really, why isn't that guy locked away? Lock him up. The violence in the book is thought to be there to enhance the message of the book, and to provoke some kind of distancing from the story itself. The point was made early on. It continues, maybe for noteriety, maybe because the guy is really that messed up. It's uneccessary.The movie stays away from this. It tells the story the way it could be told, and is probably even more effective than the book. The monologues are fantastic and Christian Bale is excellent. I heard that Leonardo DiCaprio could have been Bateman for this, which would have been the next biggest shame; apart from of course the rest movies he has been cast in.William Dafoe and Bale have great interaction together and I look forward to their scenes when I watch the movie again.The music is great and whenever I get the chance I like to discourse about art/pop bands from the 80's to whoever will listen.In conclusion, don't waste your time with the book, you'll just be appalled and needlessly so.Check out this movie. It's excellent",American Psycho

Christian Bales character was a wealthy businessmen who's psychopathic side was hidden for his environment. But then the killing began and I was really disappointed!! Again psychopaths are shown as cold blooded murderers! But not all psychopaths are murderers! When I started to watch this movie I was hoping I was going to see a businessman psychopath. A person who manipulates everybody around him without having any empathy towards them. But not a person who kills almost everybody he meets.A movie about an other kind of psychopath I would enjoy much more, I have it really hard with the cliché popular media idea of what psychopaths are. Showing a different kind of psychopath to the people would be a plus for the society.Conclusion: a really cliché movie about a psychopath",American Psycho
744,tofano-320-820958,What was that?,4,22 March 2012,"American Psycho is a movie above average in execution but ultimately hollow with an anti-climatic ending the like of which I've never seen before. Obviously this is a no-spoiler zone so I can't reveal it, but suffice it to say that rather than the reality-shifting conceit that turns great films (such as Fight Club or Jacob's Ladder) into arguably greater ones, turns this one into a thorough waste of time and effort.Nothing unique or original in this one. By this time in the 21st century we're all used to disembodied heads and chainsaw massacres by now, right? And if all the right-wing lobbies that complain about sex and violence in movies spend their whole time watching the stuff in order to complain about it, then how come they're not converted into our very own Patrick Batemans? The film actually raises this point itself, with Bateman (Christian Bale), watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre while exercising.What bothers me more is that films which usually attract such controversy as this usually have the saving grace of being actually quite good - A Clockwork Orange being a notable success in that field. American Psycho, meanwhile, is a fairly average movie, with gory violence that neither shocks nor compels, and thus fails both ways.",American Psycho
745,TheWrench,One of the Best,10,17 April 2004,"I saw American Psycho 4 times at the theaters. Few movies make it in to my 4 timers. There are some people out there that go and see movies 10 times or a hundred times, but that's a waste of money, just buy it when it's released for home systems! This movie is about Patrick Bateman, a rich, good looking, yuppie with a secure job, and a perfect life. Unfortunately Patrick is completely mad. This film based on the book American Psycho was a breath of fresh air when it was released. There were a lot of movies coming out that just seemed like products, and really had no substance. Although a lot of people didn't understand the movie, and expected something much different. What you need to understand is this movie is a dark comedy, and the things in the movie are not to be taken seriously. I even got scolded for laughing at parts while in the theater. The only thing that could ruin a great movie like this is if you made a sequel...oh, they did that. One of the great things about this movie is you can talk to people about what you think happened, whether he dreams everything, or it really happened. American Psycho 2, which is not written by the Author who wrote American Psycho the book, pretty much just shoved their opinion of what happened. So if you are going to see part 1, there is no need to see part 2. I can watch this movie over and over and never get sick of it.",American Psycho

The soundtrack is filled with cool songs and the score is smooth, the mixture of Yuppie, music, and life style is well made, giving an extraordinary dark vision, incredible detailed, each moment is unique. The direction couldn't be better, is fun from beginning to end, very violent and sexual twisted, hidding the sick secrets of Bateman till he uncovers the truth with a phone call. Well I give a this film a true 5 five stars rating, specially for Christian Bale's performance.",American Psycho

Guinevere Turner's screenplay is brilliant! The direction is fantastic. Rather than turn the book into a gory horror (which the makers easily could've done), the main themes of materialism, obsession and the strive to be the best, are all still blatant in the movie.The film is quite creepy in some places, but not scary enough to be classed as a horror. It's also worth mentioning that all the performances were great; but Christian Bale's was utterly outstanding.I would urge everyone to see it.",American Psycho

Humorous yet disgusting at the same time, that's the charm.",7,25 December 2013,"You may see it as a simple psychopathic crime-thriller but it provides so much more than that. A crazy journey of a narcissist, misanthropic man who hates competition. It falls in the rare, emerging genre of Thriller/Comedy, and lives up to it. Supported by the magnificent performance by Christian Bale, this movie will make you laugh and scream(with horror) at the same time. You would see the most elegant man with the most unconventional desires and how gracefully he satiates his urges by fulfilling them. It is not a family film and it is best if you do not watch it with your family. True it can get rather gruesome at parts but that is the charm of it. If it can make you sick yet laughing, it has just done its job. A sparkling cocktail of humour and disgust will wash over you and you would be confused as to which to give into... job done.It creeps you out and stills makes you want more of the thrill. Some scenes can make you laugh your guts out. So if you are looking for a movie with Dark Humour, this is the best you can find.",American Psycho
749,liam_ragan,Beautiful psychopathy,8,7 February 2015,"From the opening scene to the closing credits my phone stayed in my pocket and my eyes glued to the screen in complete concentration. Christian Bale takes on a Ted Bundy meets Wolf of Wall Street type character and is immediately engulfed in a world where monotonous lawyering is tolerated by day, and an insatiable blood lust embraced by night.As the viewer gets acquainted to Patrick Bateman it is immediately obvious that he is nothing like anyone we've seen before. His treatment of anyone he views as inferior is psychopathicly condescending, and his reverence for his body borders on maniacal. Add to that that he's a rampant womanizer and you end up with a protagonist you love to hate and hate to see succeed.It says something about the movie that every one of the upper class people in it is so concerned with masking their flaws that it's all we can see. In contrast, the ones who make minimum wage are humble of there defects and allow us to see a full rounded person instead of just a sham.The only fault I have with this film is its ambiguous ending. Judging by the number of similar remarks I've read, you may feel the same.Overall, incredible movie, highly recommended to anyone willing to spend sleepless nights pondering the conclusion.",American Psycho

Very impressive.I was expecting a more slasher/gory approach but I was very satisfied with what I got nonetheless. The characters and writing went together like a glove, and it kept me entertained between lines like ""I want to stab you in the f*cking throat and play with your blood"" and scenes like The Naked Chainsaw chase scene.

I can see criticisms some might make, but I'm always amazed by Bale's incredible acting, the intense dialogue, and the dark humor. There is a spoiler disclaimer at the top, but I must clarify that there are some fair sized spoilers further on in this review.I'll start with the humor. For some, it's difficult to see humor in a movie so intensely dark and grotesque. However, I'd say that killing someone with an ax to the tune of ""Huey Lewis and the News"" is fantastic. What makes it even funnier is the fact that it was all over a business card. Next, the psychology. I'm a huge fan of psychological thrillers, and this is no disappointment in that category. We slowly see the lead character slip into insanity, and catch a glimpse of what's going on in his head. That brings me to the next point, the main character himself, Patrick Bateman. The charming sociopath may seem like a hackneyed character, but this sort of character was unique. He's rarely friendly, cold, but somehow cunning and able to be a serial killer when he's not eating at Dorsia.The ending is a major plot twist to say the least. I won't ruin it, but it does leave you wondering whatever happened to some people in the film...",American Psycho

The dumping of Bateman's girlfriend was also worth watching. Other than that, it was on the whole very disappointing. Let us suspend our ethical rejection of the gore violence and plain wickedness oozing from this movie. With this warning, I can only give it a 2 on condition that the makers of this film did not take it really seriously and did it just for fun. But even that said, it doesn't work at all. Suffice to say it didn't give me nightmares, as a psycho-killer should, the characters failed to arise appeal and the development of the story was so trite it looks rather like a high school try at film making; it doesn't look even amateurish, which could have had some quaint charm. Even if the film was a success this is not an honest way to make money, as it totally fails to entertain.

I did read a few forums, though, so don't think I'm some genius mind for talking about this. It isn't about psychopathy, it's about Wall Street, and how self-absorbed everyone is. That's why mistaken identity is such a played out joke, all these scumbags look exactly alike, and other than the fact that he kills people, Patrick Bateman is just like every other one. As he says, he wants to fit in.I also find it worth mentioning that this is the only film I've watched which has made me want to read the novel.

It goes beyond portraying an 80's yuppie into a realm where anyone would recognize that he's completely unstable. There is no subtlety at all. The writers continually force down your throat that this movie takes place in the 1980's in a very inorganic way. It's like ""Yep, we get it already, you've proven your knowledge of 80's pop music."" It's not only Bale's character that's unbelievable, it's every character. Nothing rings true.

757,billf-3,"Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est?",3,17 April 2000,"My god, what a mess.  Started off with some interest, was kicky in parts, especially the send-up of '80's nouvelle cuisine, the main character's job that involved no observable work, and the analysis of Huey Lewis, Phil Collins, and Whitney Houston albums prior to murder and mayhem.  It then spiraled into the ground, leaving no survivors.  Imagine being forced to reread ""Hannibal.""  Among it's MANY weaknesses:1.  Christian Bale's performance:  Contrary to most reviews, Christian Bale gives a completely predictable, unskilled performance.  Anthony Hopkins and Kathleen Turner have popularized the sangfroid of the urbane, sophisticated serial killer, but Bale doesn't even approach them.  There's nothing new here.  Instead of chilling imperturbability, we're given monotone and wood. Monotone and wood.  Monotone and wood.  Then, trying to shock us with contrast, his outbursts of violence look like they were choreographed by Chuck Jones of Warner Bros fame.  Beep beep.  Even his breakdown scene falls flat.  We're left with all the subtlety of his earlier Speilberg role without the final mercy of an American bombing run.2.  Annoying voice-over:  I'm more forgiving of this technique than most, but the criticism is well deserved here.  It's a poor substitute for tight story and competent direction.  The main character's narcissism, the Wall Street milieu, his shallow and acquisitive colleagues, and his taste for insipid music should suffice to establish his soulless hollowness; there's no need for verbal cue cards.  I suspect it's just the director's attempt to cut through the tedium of the movie and try to legitimize the film by evoking the novel.3.  Reese Witherspoon:  Knowing what she's capable of, I can only conclude that she was hobbled by a bad script and sophomoric direction.  Just a one-dimensional rehash of Madeline Kahn from Young Frankenstein and Gloria Upson from Auntie Mame. Talk about poo-poo undies.4.  Running gags:  How many times does the audience have to see the same jokes about business card fonts and the inability to get dinner reservations?5.  Dead-end plot devices:  A private eye played by Willem Defoe and a case of mistaken identity that go nowhere.  Was this bad editing or did the filmmaker forget herself.  ""Excuse me, I was looking for the set of 'Talented Mr Ripley'.""6.  Direction and cinematography:  Makes ""Sliders"" look pretty slick.7.  Derivative:  There was NOTHING in this film that was not already done in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Bright Lights, Big City,"" and ""Serial Mom.""

The satire about the 80's consumerism is brutal and Christian Bale has the difficult job of playing a character who is playing a character.  The Bateman we see is the carefully manufactured version of what he wants us to see.  He is trying very hard to fit in and his obsession with skin care products and ""hip"" music are signs of him trying to fit in, in the most superficial way possible.

The main actor (Bale) does about a good a job as possible with the material given to him while the surrounding cast add absolutely nothing to the film. At first, the movie was strange enough, but interesting enough to make me feel like it was some strange blend of Fight Club meets Clockwork Orange, but this film lacked any depth so the morbidity of the scenes just leave you feeling ill for no purpose. The sets weren't all that great, the little things that set the main actor off were just stupid, and their commentary on upscale, snobbish life in New York in the 1980's was at first interesting, but then mind-bogglingly exaggerated and idiotic. If anything, one might get this for the gore and horror effect, but alas it falls short in that area as well as the movie has only a sprinkle of blood and wouldn't scare a 5 year old.

763,andyniess,Razor-sharp satire,9,1 February 2001,"A powerful attack on mid-80s Wall Street culture, anchored by an Oscar-caliber performance by Christian Bale and smart direction by Mary Harron.  American Psycho is the story of Patrick Bateman, a vain and wealthy yuppie whose main interests are vapid pop music and murder. Bateman stands out in a cinemascape overflowing with serial killers: his blankness is more disturbing than any psychotic rant.  Bale's portrayal constantly involves and surprises us, able to move effortlessly between coked-up goofiness and cruel violence.  This film should have made much more money, and for those normally put off by horror films the violence and gore are brief: the real focus here is on Bateman, and the society that nurtures him.  This character is truly frightening and plausible.

And what with American Beauty being released, was ready for the influx of all films having this prefix as standard.Anyway the film despite it's title is great, I loved the humour, the acting and direction. The eighties have never been so good and yup so cold. It really struck me though after watching the film that the eighties were a very odd time indeed, what a change in lifestyles for many people seeking many greedy acquisitions. And here we have Patrick epitomising the yuppie culture of high rise New York, with a strange assortment of superficial personal and pier relationships.The fact that he is completly deranged probably has something about selling his soul to corporate America, and only psychopaths could be wielding their power in this manner in these institutions (Many of which  produce horrific consequences, socially and environmentally globally.)Others who have commented are keen to state that this is not a horror flick. It is true deep dark satire agreed. But why are people jumping to the defence of this film. It is horror, we don't have to see the gore, implied violence and our imaginations are far more scary, check Hitchcock's Psycho.The Batesmanesque twisted persona is a parallel of our our own facination and languish of video nasties.

770,whalleywhat,Hilarious,9,7 June 2007,"I've never read the book, but I know a lot of people who did, and they tend to not like the movie. Now, I always think movies based on books should be judged as separate entities. It's adapted by a screenwriter and interpreted by a director, and they may make choices that the author didn't intend. This doesn't instantly make one or the other better or worse, they're just different. That being said, it seemed like the reason a lot of the fans of the book were disappointed was because Mary Harron wasn't interested in depicting scenes of extreme gore. This isn't a Fulci film and it isn't Hostel, it's brilliant social commentary and comedy. Of course this is the most pitch black sort of humour, but it cracks me up. Most of the humour comes from this central point: Patrick Bateman is a psychopath, a completely soulless person incapable of thinking of anyone but himself, and in the booming 80s Wall Street world, he fit in perfectly. It's been noted that Bale's performance even caused some viewers to like Bateman. But how couldn't they. Look at all of his ""friends"" and ""lovers."" They're able to feel empathy, they choose to live this way. They're the monsters. Bateman can't help but be like them. So when Bateman raises an axe to Paul Allen (played by the equally despicable Jared Leto) you can't help but share in his glee. The yucks don't stop. The business card one-upping (uh, I think they're all the same), Bateman's call for a return to morals at some ridiculous restaurant, the girl who confuses ""mergers and acquisitions"" for ""murders and executions."" In particular Bateman's lengthy monologues about his awful taste in music (early Huey Lewis was too ""black sounding,"" Genesis really came into their own once Phil Collins took the reigns.) These tend to precede his violent acts, and I think they're the crux of the film. While he has a lot of knowledge and has clearly put a lot of thought into his opinions, the music he loves and his appreciation for it is just like him, soulless. A perfect surface wrapped around a gaping void. Anyways, I could go on, but I have to return some videotapes.",American Psycho

Dir. Mary Harron
Based on the novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis (1991)There are very few works that enjoy the sophistication of being hailed as 'Best in class'. American Psycho starring Christian Bale, Jared Leto, Willem Dafoe edges right into that renowned bracket.I've come across very few films that delivered a solid punch without having a beefy narrative. THIS is just that.American Psycho features Christian Bale, (yes, The Batman from Gotham) who has a roguish inner-self kept in abeyance. The other appearing characters are also subtly written without having many of any signs of their own; yet, deliver a crucial impact on the storyline in their peculiar ways.From being portrayed as a well-established investment banker, the plot follows Patrick Bateman's horrifying spiral into uncontrolled barbarity. The 'Patrick Bateman' persona oozes narcissism and his unquenchable thirst for bloodshed. While the film is considered to be a cult classic by many, everything comes down to the person watching it. Because the subject shown in the movie is unlike any of the regular movies that you'd have watched and will surely leave you gasping if you're unprepared.As long as performances are concerned, Christian Bale has completely nailed the role of the wretched Patrick Bateman. The ease with which he pulls off various shades and sides of the character is something to applaud. If the film doesn't appeal to you, Christian Bale's act will.The final word is, American Psycho is one of those rarest (disturbing) films that managed to balance dark humor, horror, gore, performances in equal proportions and gives you a whole new vibe as long as you're in Mr. Bateman's gore-filled shoes.",American Psycho
777,weleonor,Not bad at all,6,4 November 2021,"A surreal horror/comedy, ou can't really tell between the two, I only know that it works, at least I thought that it actually worked out fine, not Percy.y but still worth a watch just with friends chilling... I think it is an easy thing to watch also if you are tired, not bad!",American Psycho
778,albertodr07,Christian Bale the new Peter Cushing,9,6 October 2008,"Now it all makes sense. Christian Bale was born to play horror characters. I couldn't understand why I was so , so, afraid of him even in films like ""Velvet Goldmine"" He is a poster boy for putrid souls in elegant wrapping. In ""American Psycho"" - a film that deserves much more attention than it's got - he is absolutely terrific. Totally believable. I could sense his delight in playing a monster of this kind. Interestingly enough this manicured monster seems to be asking for sympathy, imagine the nerve! But Christian Bale succeeds in showing us a face we (I) hadn't quite seen before and yet we (I) accept without question. He should have gotten an Oscar nomination but, fortunately, he didn't.",American Psycho
779,J_Thomas101,Got To Love This One!,10,14 February 2008,Christian BALE! 'Nuff said! He made this movie into a masterpiece that i could have only dreamed of! With his one-liners (I have to return some video tapes) to the actual movie... it was amazing from start to finish. I watch it all the time!! The way he was killing people and the so nonchalant way he left it and moved on was priceless. the music used and the preparation time while he explained some of the greatest artist in music history was ridiculously funny! You just have to see it to appreciate it's brilliance! I never would have imagined it would be all it was. I expected it to be another one of those messed up movies that turned out to OK... but once i actually sat down to watch it... I knew it would live on as one of my favorite movies of all time! One of Christian Bales best movies ever! And he just keeps growing into an amazing actor!,American Psycho
780,duskeye,Highly amusing,10,6 October 2002,"Okay so it wasn't a patch on the book. As a movie and book buff I can safely say the only film I have ever seen which DID surpass the book was 'The Shawshank Redemption' and I don't think many would disagree. So I wasn't expecting this film to wow me as the book did - the book is a classic in every way and I've read it over ten times, one of my all time faves. The film simply cannot convey the depths of emptiness that Bateman has sunk to, though it still provides for a highly entertaining, funny and brilliantly acted piece of cinema.Bale is perfect, Dafoe a pleasure (as always) and even Leto charmingly stupid. Witherspoon I can't stand and although this film did nothing to change that, I grudgingly admit she was perfect as Evelyn, though one has to wonder whether she was in on the joke.As a black comedy, it's confusing - as a horror movie, it's too arty - as a psychological thriller, it's lost control - but as a movie, it's damn good. Just don't try to categorise it, and don't try too hard to analyse it. If that's what you're after, read the book (twice). Portraying modern society's undeniable emptiness and ultimate futility in two hours was never going to be easy, but if that's your cup of tea (it's certainly mine) then this is a great ride. For my money this is far better conveyed in the masterpiece 'Fight Club' but 'Psycho' is worth your time.",American Psycho
781,IMDB_Steve,An incredibly odd film that just doesn't deliver,4,4 July 2013,"I found myself waiting with hope that this film might just pick up but apart from about 10 minutes, this film is as flat as glass and as dull as ditch water.Don't get me wrong, Bale's acting was very good and he played the part of a creepy weirdo very well and the script was clever and contained many literal turns and twists. It's just the film itself lacked lustre, it had all the good hallmarks of a film that, after the first 20 steady minutes of introductions and getting the viewer embroiled in the plot turns into an absolute scorcher... But sadly after 20 minutes nothing really happened, and after 30, then 40... nothing. I did find myself hooked, hooked on waiting for something to happen... but it just didn't arrive.Maybe the book was good, I don't know I have not read it. But I'm guessing that the subtle mind tinkering that many horror and thriller writers achieve in their novels just didn't transgress to the silver screen and instead you are left being delivered the plot outright without having to think... this pretty much left nothing else in the tin.Shame, I had real high hopes for this film due to it's IMDb rating, but instead it just didn't deliver on the expectation.",American Psycho
782,Beeeyaaatch,I do not agree with Infofreako,9,11 January 2003,"I loved this film. It wasn't a comedy but it was comedic in scenes due to the cluelessness and lethargy of the other characters. Patrick Bateman is a serial killer, plain and simple, but that is not the purpose of this film. The main character thinks that he can get away with anything because he is rich and priveleged. The movie was violent, but not as much of the book. However, I think blood and gore would have taken away from the overall satire of the film by turning it into a campy horror movie. The film had a not-so-clear subtext: The absurdity of the killer's actions and motives equal that of the rich, corporate, snob's. Does a world based on business cards, fancy restaurants, and affairs have any more depth than that of a self-obsessed, unremourseful, unhuman creature such as Patrick Bateman? That is what you'll be asking yourself at the end of this movie. I give it a 9/10!",American Psycho
783,dontcallmewilliam,Review of American Psycho,5,9 February 2010,"I had been looking forward to seeing this for a long time and I've got to say that after finally seeing it, I was a bit disappointed. It's not that it was a bad movie. It just wasn't what I expected it to be. I thought the film would be right up my alley, but instead it was just way too out there and weird for my tastes. Not to mention the ending completely baffled me. There are some good answers for any questions I may have had when the film was over, but when I was trying to piece things together, there always seemed to be something that totally foiled whatever theory I was going with. Perhaps, this is the whole idea behind the film. It's possible that the filmmakers wanted to leave the ending open to interpretation and that's not necessarily a bad thing. In the end, I'll say that I thought it was good, just not as good as I had hoped. I wouldn't purchase this myself, as this is not a film I could ever see myself watching again, but I have no problem referring this as a rental to anyone who isn't squeamish and easily weirded out.",American Psycho
784,jon6810,feed me a stray cat.,10,25 May 2007,"First off, know I laughed the entire movie. And when I wasn't laughing I was covering my gaping smile with my hands.If only every movie Bale did was this awesome. He brought that dark/sexy/maniacal/obsessed role to an apex. Nicholson's crazy in the Shining, but Bale is the best f'n crazy guy ever! I'm not gay, but I would totally let him give me a speech on shitty pop music, boss me around, then, I don't know, take a nail gun to the back of my head. Jesus, this movie was fun.The lampooning of the whole '80s excess' point was exercised excitingly and was bitingly hilarious. Notwithstanding the business card scene or the opening monologue, there are smaller, i feel more significant, parts that really twist the darkly comedic knife a little more: 1) He is finally alone in his office (after the high-power setup) and he turns the TV on and its 'the price is right'. end scene. hilarious.2) Once the movie picks up more and you know the dude's psycho, he goes out to eat and there's this little inner monologue where he gets so mortified that you think someone that he's killed is stapled to the ceiling but the ""flood"" of anxiety is because he was unsure about the availability of seating at the restaurant. also, equally, hilarious.More so, there was excellently selective directing. It was beautiful and taut, with a great Edward scissor-hands-esquire feeling of a fantasy world (i.e., dragging a bag clearly full of 'body' past the front door man, i.e., the whole damn movie). everything works so well in its unbelievability and graveness that once the movie is on its way, it stops being an issue and allows the viewer to simply enjoy the film.To further toot Bale's horn, it seems like the rest of the cast could have been Popsicle sticks hung by fishing line in every scene because he TRULY did make this movie. It kind of makes you try to think of other movies that were so good because of the main character's portrayal. And if Leonardo DiCaprio took the role, heaven forbid, it would have been such a misplaced decision that 'American Psycho' could have been another 'Basketball Diaries' (because, hey, didn't he look like a twelve year old junkie?). Great casting.And don't get me started about the clearly audible, yet somehow indistinct, comments he makes to people about his psychosis (See ""murders and executions, mostly""; ""i like to dissect girls""; ""I need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale""). All of that was almost too much to bear.All in all, this is such a fantastic film that has proved difficult to talk about in public because whether imitating or discussing, people look at you like you are a sick piece of sh*t.What could be better?",American Psycho
785,RodneyKashmir,Christian Bale's best performance,10,3 September 2012,"I'm not going to get into the differences between the book and the movie. This is simply a good movie, disregard the book for minute, the acting was great, the direction was astounding, and the script was chilling. Christian Bale's performance ranges from calm and controlled to a sometimes cartoonish (yet frightening)homicidal mania.There wee parts of the movie where he almost reminded me of Jim Carrey, yet some how throughout all of it he still scares the crap out of me. This may be a spoiler but I don't' think it is, just be warned; there's a part in the movie where Christian Bale is naked, covered in blood, holding a chainsaw, laughing, chasing a woman down a hall. With any other actor this would've been the stupidest movie scene in history, yet Christian Bale brings a sort of homicidal energy, and deranged joy into it, almost like the Joker from Batman, there is not a second in this movie where I was thinking: ""This is ridiculous"" and there are plenty of scenes like the chainsaw scene mentioned above.I think this shows the pure ability of Christian Bale that he can take this absurd character and somehow ground him in reality.I watched this movie twice in a row. I'm not exaggerating. As soon as I finished it I started the whole thing over again and it was just as good if not better the second time. This is one of my favorite movie's and I have no trouble recommending it too a friend or stranger.Ten out of ten, five out of five, simply an amazing movie.",American Psycho
786,maverick50,"""Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?""",10,6 April 2004,"Crazy. Confusing. Entertaining. Funny ('feed me a stray cat'). Totally bizarre! This is simply an awesome film! Bale gives a perfect performance of Patrick Bateman, if you've read the book you'll know what to expect, its not exactly the sort of film your mother would enjoy but i really urge everyone to see this movie. The supporting cast all do their jobs well (look out for a young reese witherspoon) but Bale well and truly steals the show and is so effortlessly ingaging as Bateman i have found myself watching films purely if he is in them. Check out the memorable quotes to see some of the great one liners to be found in this truly spectacular film.The film is thought provoking and to a degree quite scary as it makes you really think about the normal looking guy at work that little bit different.A must see.",American Psycho
787,MiracleDrug,Underrated as hell,10,11 October 2006,"It has the same dark hum-our as A Clockwork Orange and Christian Bale is absolutely brilliant. It's a film you don't like the first time you see it. Probably, you hate it. Yet, after a few viewings you see the brilliant, dark hum-our in it. It's absolutely hilarious to see Bateman slaughtering people, but in the next scene noticing that all he really cares about is returning his videotapes on time or that someone has a better businesscard.Patrick Bateman lives in a lot of people in a way. Lots of people don't give *beep* about other people, just care about there possessions and mostly themselves. In this aspect American Psycho touches a lot of the same grounds as say Fight Club.Just as the main character of Clockwork Orange, you are shocked and terrified of Bateman because he is an embodiement of all our greatest realistic fears and worries. Or at least a lot of them anyway.yet, Fight Club and A Clockwork Orange are seen as two of the greatest movies ever and this movie only gets a 6.9 People should dare to see beyond there disgust. Maybe that's why they don't like it, it reflects too much of themselves. It scares the hell out of them. It's like looking in a mirror and they don't like the reflection.I truly hope in time this movie will get the appreciation it deserves.",American Psycho
788,zig_utzig,A masterpiece both commercially and artistically,10,17 March 2014,"I can't believe I overlooked this film for so long. I rarely give a 10/10, but this one deserved it. Neither too artsy or too commercial, just a perfect balance between a blockbuster horror and a tragic drama. This equilibrium paves the way for Christian Bale to deliver a great performance which is, in my opinion, the prime of his career, both commercially and artistically. His performance is very professional yet passionate, like he was completely absorbed into the character's infatuation for mass murder. Bale makes a connection with the audience with his charm and neatness, while his eyes make the character's schizophrenia almost tangible.",American Psycho
789,ohjonkeat,Greatest film of 2000s,10,14 September 2016,"American Psycho is one of my favourite films of all time. It is such a great film with a cult following, but why does it not get more critical acclaim? At the bare minimum, Christian Bale should have been nominated for one of the acting awards. Gladiator, like really? 30 years down the road, it will be films like American Psycho that will be more fondly remembered.One of the things that makes this film so great is the atmosphere. The overall atmosphere has an at-times-surreal, 80s feel that I have yet to witness in any other film.The acting performances of Christian Bale and Willem Dafoe are as good as they get.The cinematography and sound effect/editing does not get sufficient credit. Of course, we also get to enjoy Patrick Bateman's favourite 80s music along the way.Notice how I have deliberately not mentioned about the plot? I do not get why people are so hung up over the ending. Perhaps their over- focus on the plot is one of the reasons this film is underrated.IMO, this is the greatest film of 2000s, and one of the greatest films of all time.",American Psycho
790,anduarto,Stylish thriller that ultimately doesn't add up,6,15 January 2008,"This is one of the those movies I like less the more I think about it. I gave it a 7 shortly after I saw it. Not a great movie, a little gratuitous, but with a lot to recommend it. I boasts a top notch cast led by a compelling performance from Christian Bale. It's visually beautiful if at times grizzly. And, for those of us who survived the era, there's a certain perverse nostalgia for New York in the '80's. Having slept on it, however, I had to come back today and pull my vote down to a 6. The strong parts remain, but the weak ones grow more blatant with reflection. I have two major complaints:1) The portrayal of men in the movie is predictably dismal. They're all shallow and horrible and the movie is not without the faintest hint that the men only differ from the homicidal protagonist in the degree of their violence and contempt. I don't know many men like this. In a movie purportedly about the human psyche, such a skewed understanding of the ""norm"" is a substantial flaw.2) Ultimately, it stretches credibility too far. How can he possibly get away with all this? Perhaps I missed something. There's a mistaken identity thread that runs through the movie, but even that doesn't seem sufficient to explain the movie's ultimate outcome. If it wasn't for this site's obsession with ""spoilers', I could go into more detail, but many aspects - large and small - just don't ring true.American Psycho is a stylish thriller worth seeing if only for the magnificent transformation of Bale. He is very good. But if you're looking for a deep probing of the human psyche - or even a plausible one - look elsewhere.",American Psycho

793,bkmotive,A terrible movie with spectacular acting by Christian Bale,3,14 February 2018,"Let's start with the good since this movie has far little good to say about it. Patrick Bateman is a big firm Wall Street guy who has his own personal assistant, lives in a luxury apartment in New York City, and hangs around the snobbiest douche bags you can imagine in the world of big financial firms. The typical cocaine and fancy restaurants crew who have tons of misogynistic bullshit to throw around and treat each other like some Harvard/Yale fraternity, which by no surprise, Bateman mentions he has an MBA from Harvard. Christian Bale is a great actor.. His acting as Patrick Bateman, who we find pretty early on in the movie is a psychopath (Surprise, surprise!) with a fetish for killing hookers and prostitutes, is very believably and spot on. Kudos to him for his acting in this movie.Now, let's talk the bad. This movie has no plot, no real story, and no viable message at the end of it. Some bad sex scenes, a Jared Leto cameo (his part is very minute), a good amount of gore and an ending that is completely absurd, that spoiling it would actually be doing you a favor, as it might save you from watching this terrible movie sums up the entire movie, if you include the introduction I gave you about Patrick Bateman. Now let's add a few more details because you're probably still curious enough to watch it.. In the firm he works for, people barely know Patrick Bateman. A few of his cohorts confuse him for other persons, calling him by the wrong name and the typical big firm kinda crap you see in movies. What makes Bateman different? He's OCD, obsessed with his image and taking care of his body and face (which they do just an okay job of showing with one scene), enjoys Phil Collins and likes to banter about seemingly irrelevant facts to make himself look like a pop culture connoisseur right before he murders his hooker victims.Sadly, that last description probably makes you more interested in watching it than not.. Let me save you the time by letting you know that, they do not in any way shape or form portray why Mr. Bateman becomes the way he is.. He simply just ""IS"". this way in the movie. If you really try to dig deep into this movie and try to shovel a message out of this pile of crap, you might be left with this: It seems the movie tries to suggest at the end that all the people around him in his career field are also pretty much psychopaths in their own way.. Snobby, fancy suit and designer wearing, cocaine and Chardonnay, obsessed with booking dinners at fancy restaurants, aroused by having the most fancy business card out of their colleagues (actually possibly the only interesting scene in this movie was the card scene), having apartments that overlay Central Park, and ragging each other about their Ivy league schools with a handful of homosexual jokes, almost oblivious to the world below them..But besides that, there's also a suggestion of no one really knowing who he is because he, himself, does not know who he is.. Even his lawyer at the end calls him by a different name, and doesn't realize he's Bateman. But let's not get carried away, since the message is not clear and there is no plot to this movie. Nothing ever reaches a climax or height.. More like a rampant buildup, then a frenzy, before a dull haze and then boom it's over. This movie lacks anything clever or meaningful whatsoever. It's just a sex, blood, hooker movie with Christian Bale's great acting and amazingly impressive physique. More work went into that physique than went into any directing, production or writing of this movie, for sure. VERDICT: If you value your time, skip this movie as there is only one or two scenes that are ""good movie"" material.. If that.",American Psycho
794,mdumouch-1,A brilliantly misunderstood film...,10,13 January 2006,"If I were to tell anyone anything about the film, American Psycho, it would simply be ""do not take this film at face value"". This is an homage to a time in history. However recent the 80s may have been, they are still a definitive time period, very unlike today. This film takes great lengths to explore the decadence and opulence of the boom in culture that occurred in the 1980s. The movie focuses its story on one man, Patrick Bateman, and his existence in this neon lit, over saturated, pop music world. We are given little as to how Bateman became who he is, but we do enter his life at a time which could only best be described as his ""breaking point"". How this breakdown occurs and really what it results in is very open to debate as you will find, but I urge you to view this film and interpret, do not simply watch. It is a truly original and intelligent piece of work and the horror the film produces is equaled if not topped by both its wit and satire. Christian Bale is brilliant as is the supporting cast. The only negative that has resulted from this film is a very bad sequel that seems to have clearly missed the point of the first film.",American Psycho
795,salman_film_guy,"Underrated, but could have been a masterpiece",7,14 February 2019,"Don't let the fact that it's about a psychopathic serial killer fool you -- It's anything but a slasher flick. You won't know what to make of it once you are done watching. In fact, what the film is really about is hard to pin down. You will feel that you have learned something, but what exactly? Wall Street scum? Rampant narcissism?As far is the source material is concerned, it's watered down just enough to give it a realistic opportunity of screening in theaters without being tossed outta the window. Keeping such things in mind, I'm confident enough to call it the most faithful adaptation possible without inducing vomit.This exploratory film treks through so many levels. While it delves into the mind of a psychopath, it also simultaneously manages to somehow represent the ills of modern society on screen. Valuing matter over mind, the empty social consumerism, empty words, empty lives, an empty people. It would make a Wall Street corporate yuppie uncomfortable, while those who are too far gone might just even relate.The voice-over dialogue adds to the film's already potent thematics, invoking a better look at the psychopath's mind and inner turmoil. The abstractions and confession-like style pays tribute to Wall Street ills. Yet the tongue-in-cheek tone keeps the portrayed social horrors from getting too heavy.The highlight however is Christian Bale's portrayal of the lead narcissist, Patrick Bateman. There is an intense focus on vanity and appearances involving effeminate morning routines and insistent workouts. The high status he has made for himself provides an eerily effective buffer between his outer appearance and inner turmoils, blending well into his equally shallow peers. A bit too well in fact, unwittingly emphasizing the not-so-stellar performances by the support characters. While Christian Bale's fascinating performance stands well against the rest of the cast, it is hard to tell if he was born to play narcissists and psychopaths or if he butchered the role (no pun intended). The shallowness of his expressions is remarkable, but not particularly terrifying. Whether it was Oscar worthy or not, I leave up to you.While the film (especially the ending) leaves something to be desired, the pioneering aspect does make up for some of it. Nearly two decades later, the film still feels relevant and will continue alluding to film connoisseurs further still.",American Psycho
796,erich67,Misunderstood,8,12 June 2018,"There are two threads I see running through the negative reviews of this movie - one disappointing, and one understandable.1. This is not a horror film in the traditional sense and was never meant to be. If you are judging it on that basis, you have completely missed the point. This is disappointing because you overlooking what is truly satisfying about the film.2. The movie is hilarious! But comedy is subjective, so you can't blame a person who does not get or like satire or black comedy. That is understandable because it is a matter of taste. If so, this film just wasn't for you.One last comment. I suppose it is a product of the two points above, but I still find it hard to believe that anyone watched this film and was not impressed with Christian Bale. He nailed the character right down to the smallest nuance, and he was entertaining every moment he was on the screen. In my opinion, it is one of his 2-3 best performances as an actor, if not his best.All that said, the move was not perfect. 8/10",American Psycho
797,gran,Um...,5,17 April 2000,"I think 'American Psycho' was made solely to see just how many unresolved plotlines could possibly be packed into one film before it was completely ruined. The answer to the dilemma is exactly one less than existed in this film. I didn't have a problem with the sex or the violence at all - they suited the story just fine - but I've never seen a more unresolved film - on all levels - in my life. The script would've failed Screenwriting 101; and campy, quasi-clever references to Huey Lewis, Whitney Houston, and other pop-musical has-beens don't change that fact, though I think they think that they can conceal it.",American Psycho

Brett Easton Ellis' often gory novel is done as a brilliant satire of the Me Decade, and is hilarious to boot. Anyone expecting a slasher film will leave disappointed, but the intelligent movie goer will have a great time. Christian Bale's breakthrough performance as Wall Streeter-slash-killer Patrick Bateman will make him one of Hollywood's most sought after actors. Forget him in ""Shaft""; Bale is perfectly cast as the well-to-do yuppie with the unquenchable thirst for violence and murder. Although it bombed at the box office, ""American Psycho"" will be one of those flicks that achieves cult classic status on video.",American Psycho

If you're a fan of the black, sarcastic type of flick - American Beauty, Very Bad Things, that 'genre' then you will enjoy this.  If you come looking for the typical Hollywood script with the safe acting and political correctness you will be disappointed.  I wasn't.The acting was surprisingly good and the film was very engaging.  The movie doesn't take itself very seriously (lots of laughter from the audience, even during the murder scenes).  You can almost see the film mocking itself. The critics don't go for that, but everyone in the theatre I was in seemed to really enjoy it.  I'm going to see it again.

It is much more tame than the book and the emphasis is definitely not on this aspect of the film.American Psycho is definitely a BLACK comedy.  Not to be grouped with Silence of the Lambs or other serial killer films.As Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale delivers an Oscar worthy performance. He maintains his lunatic enthusiasm throughout the entire film.

803,Mogelberg,Very close to the novel and worth the wait!,9,20 April 2000,"Very rarely have I watched a movie based on a novel that I've read and liked it. Usually the expectations are way too high and cannot possibly be met, but American Psycho was an exemption.  It was a long time underway, but definitely worth the wait!Of course, the movie was not as graphic as the book (or perhaps my imagination!?) and surely it was not intended to be.  Had it been exactly like the novel it would most likely have received a quite different rating! What some people perhaps forget is that the book was intended as a parody of the 80's.  People who are disgusted by the book or movie probably do not realize this.Christian Bale played a perfect Pat Bateman and I look forward to seeing him in his next movies!In short: If you liked the book - see the movie!",American Psycho
804,BigMack,A thought-provoking dark comedy,8,11 April 2000,"What can I say?  This is quite a movie.  It's a dark comedy like I've never seen before, in that it intends to create both comedy and honor simultaneously.  However, in some parts (especially near the end), it falls short.  But, the true power in this movie lies in the ""hero"" (more like the antihero), a businessman who has been driven insane by the emptiness of life.   None of the other characters are developed much, instead opting for a full development of the madness that exists within this protagonist (and within all psychos).  Therefore, we catch a glimpse of the deeply chilling and humorous mind of a madman.  Although the ending is very vague, this movie will give you something to think about.",American Psycho
805,papale,A dreadful comic investigation of human mind...,8,1 November 2001,"Guys, you have to see this movie! Well, actually you'd better read the book first. You'll be shocked by the book. I'm not that delicate, and i'm used to fearful violent readings, but i admit i had to shut the book close, at times, cause i couldn't bear imagining the situations described in it.The movie's softer. It explores the black-comedy side the book already had, conceiling and leaving to your imagination the massacres, the tortures, the killing. The movie won't show you Patrick murdering a kid at the zoo; it won't show you what Patrick does to his victims' eyes.But it succeeds anyway in making you understand. In taking you to the place Bret Easton Ellis wanted to take you to: the misery and the social violence of the eighties will be in front of you. The emptiness, the shallowness and the stupidity of those years will be in front of your eyes, and you will get to understand how a young man could reach the point of imagining to perpetuate such indescribable crimes, of wishing it. He will imagine so, he will wish so just tell himself he's alive. Killing, murdering, torturing, raping...all those actions (beware, he only imagines them...) represent a form of rebellion against a superficial society, where business cards are status symbol, and where you'd better have a very elegant one in your pocket if you don't want to be rejected by society. Where persons don't have a name, don't have an identity...cause they all look the same... on that background, killing is living, torturing is shouting out at the world ""look, i have a personality, i'm not just another one of those guys you see out there"", raping is surviving.The movie shows all that, with a lighter touch than the book but with almost the same effectiveness. Cold lights, perfect settings, good writing. And one last, important ingredient: a huge Christian Bale...his performance is stunning. He is Patrick Bateman, he is all of us.",American Psycho

But the killer Batemann is a boring idiot and the message ""Society is sick"" is as old as the knowledge of how to roast coffee, if not older. After 90 minutes the grand finale ""Did he or did he not?"" is much less interesting than the question ""How many people will be in the bathroom at the time I get out of here?""",American Psycho
807,blackthorne138,Absolutely Hilarious,9,16 April 2000,The best film I have seen in theaters in a very long time. Christian Bale is excellent in his interpetation of my favorite yuppie/madman. Many parts of the movie I found myself laughing like a lunatic.  With the exception of a few parts from the book I would have loved to have seen in in the movie it is well worth seeing. One of the funniest aspects of the film is the use of early and mid-80's pop music. It makes a very funny and creepy backdrop for some of the scenes.

It isn't great, and far from the next Silence of the Lambs as some have suggested, but it does have its moments and on the whole is worth the time and money to see.The main reason to see this picture is for the performance of Christian Bale.  This is a star-making performance if I have ever seen one. Throughout the picture I was reminded of Tom Cruise, especially Cruise in Eyes Wide Shut.  His performance is both funny and disturbing at the same time, a very difficult line to walk.  Some of his scenes, where he is discussing his music while preparing to kill, is brilliant in the way Bale builds the insanity and detachment of his character.  You can see it in his eyes, that this character knows no remorse and that killing to him is not so much a choice as a personality flaw, to put it mildly.A lot has also been said of the satire this film has of the 80's yuppie lifestyle.  That aspect of the film was one that didn't particularly resonate me.  I thought it was a bit heavy-handed, but the 80s yuppie lifestyle served as a very effective backdrop for the better story of thehollow shell of a man who kills because he feels he has to.There are bad parts to this film.  I thought some of the characters were unnecessary and some of the storyline muddled, but at the same time those weaknesses contributed to the haunting feel of the film, the world through a serial killer's eyes, where no human being is likeable or of value and the day to day lifestyle seems almost as insane as a killing spree.  There were times when I wasn't sure what was happening, but I suspect that was true for the character on the screen as well, which is why it worked even when it seemed convoluted.For all it's flaws, this is a good picture.

This film is already becoming a cult classic.  Bale's portrayal of the eccentric Bateman is almost flawless;  as you watch the movie, you can even sympathize with Bateman and almost want to be the hip, smooth talking, musically inclined money man himself (that is, until he starts to really lose himself).  Also, as a side note, I thought Reese Witherspoon was exceptional in this movie, peeking in a role that she was born to play. This movie certainly isn't for everyone, and a lot of people won't enjoy/understand it, but it's probably one of the better movies I've seen in the past two years.",American Psycho
811,deveroux,Trip and a half,8,17 April 2000,"Christian Bale gives a truly outstanding performance in this film.  There have been many portrayals of over the edge characters with very few redeeming qualities and most times, the actors tend to not let the audience into the inner workings to really understand or even care what makes the character tick.  Although this film never really gives concrete reasons as to why Patrick Bateman turns into a murderous madman, Bale somehow manages to make him seem human.Disturbing, thoughtful and wickedly humorous, the film itself is a delicious satire on high society and the ""status quo"".  Like a hybrid of ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" and ""Heathers"", this film out does those cult classics in it's style, finesse and message.",American Psycho
812,oscarnoah,I think a lot of people are missing what this is about,4,27 April 2000,"spoilersfirst off, am I the only one who noticed the blatant Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" references in this movie? Outside of the fact that it is called ""american PSYCHO"" and the main character's name is patrick BATEman (norman BATEs) also, as the movie went along, I also started noticing music that was very similar to bernard herman's score for ""Psycho"". I have not read the novel, but any writer can tell you that if you choose to write a book with psycho in the title about a homicidal maniac whom has a similar name to one Norman Bates, you better expect some parallels. it's sort of like if I wrote a book called the RAVEN's nest and the damsel in distress' name was Lenore. you get me?now that I am done raving about that, I can talk about the movie itself. honestly, I think that this whole thing is about identity. I think that herron was trying to say that if we allow ourselves the opportunity to get lost in our identity (in this case the loss of identity is through mid eighties commercialism) then we lose hold of our perceptions of reality. Patrick bateman had become a product of this culture that promotes the idea that your identity can be reduced to your business card. once he had fallen into this state of faceless day to day doldrums where none of the people in a circle of friends can tell each other apart, he lost control over himself, and started to release himself through remorseless killings. only the thing is, just like the rest of his life, it was all a charade. patrick bateman wasn't actually killing people, it was just his way of releasing, and it turned to unbelievable preportions. do you actually think that he really shot two police cars untill they exploded, and then was chased into a high rise by a police helicopter, only to be walking around in public the very next day? comeon.",American Psycho

The shocking killing scenes from the book are there, but you don't see it all in detail - because that would have been impossible to watch (if you have read the novel, you know what I mean). Christian Bale is an exciting and skillful actor of whom I like to see more. The direction, the use of music and the visuals were outstanding and the 80's era was extremely well recreated. Many scenes were almost directly adapted from the book, and even the sign with the last words of the novel was there (again, if you have read the novel...). DON'T WATCH THIS FILM if you think it's in the fashion of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and similar teen horror films, because it's certainly not.

It has really genuinely funny moments in the film that I liked.  When Christian Bale's character starts talking about music, it's a gutbuster.  The business card stuff was great.  There are plenty of others as well that show good humor and sharp wit.Also, the 80s timeframe set for this movie was a good choice for the strange clique that Bale's character keeps.  His interaction with his friends is great.  The notion of this unstable psychopath milling about (and strangely fitting in with) these stiff businessmen with their rigid routine is pretty original.Unfortunately for American Psycho, these weren't enough.  They added some nice spice to the film, but man cannot enjoy basil alone.  Watching this movie is like eating bread dough with some rosemary on top.  You can detect some interesting stuff in there, but it's bland for the most part.  Most of the time spent watching this movie I was glancing at my watch seeing how much longer I had left to wait till it was done.Baseline is that American Psycho has some good parts, but you have to sit through the rest of the movie to get to them.

823,markinbarnet,Very Disappointing! The scariest part of the film is the Close up of the Phil Collins C.D. Cover!,1,29 June 2001,"This had the potential to be brilliant, but is very poorly written.
The dialogue is weak to say the least. The main character's dialogue is inane and pretentious, and the feeble attempt to add depth by petty obsessiveness does not work to the judging eye.Also he is remarkably insecure, which is greatly at odds with his achievement in life - a brilliant, calculating careerman, which is what he must have been up to this point in his life to get the office that he has!
In the parts where Bale is about to wreak havoc, he embarks on post-modern soliloquy, based on the careers of Pop Stars. No doubt, the aim of these commentaries, was to chill our spines, that this highly reasoning, exponent of individualism, could use his intelligence to mindlessly chop people up!However, rather than being spine tingling, the dialogue merely bores us to death and the victims surely would not have felt any pain, and they would have been rendered unconscious by his mind-numbing long before he got around to dismembering them.Where the hell was the end?

824,brianshields,"Dark, subversive and hilarious",9,10 July 2001,"I really enjoyed this film although I missed it at the cinema and haven't read the book (the latter comes highly recommended from other sources).The film is actually a black comedy and satire on 80s morality (complete with cheesy 80s soundtrack, clothing and other references), following a mid twenties stockbroker and his double life of torture and murder.In actual fact, despite it's rating there's relatively little in the way of gore, and the film doesn't use unnecessary gratuity. Instead it carefully builds a very controlled sense of panic, as Bateman (the protagonist) struggles with the schism between his daytime persona and nightime behaviour. This means when the film does change gears it's a genuine shock. Top marks for direction.Like Fight Club, it's an interesting study of violent desires (from a very different angle, although there's still the identity, branding and schitzoid themes), and like Fight Club the people who will enjoy and understand it most will probably be driven away by it's ""Slasher"" title.",American Psycho

As much as I enjoyed watching the movie, the book was a torture for some reason. Maybe it was because of the length or descriptions of sex and violence that were too much without any point (or maybe I just don't understand the point). But the movie was perfect, a perfect balance between violence and humor, the way it doesn't show violence to its very end but leaves you suspecting and imagining... And then the scene when he calls his lawyer and admits his crimes, I laughed my head out. This is not a horror movie and if you expect a horror you will be disappointed.",American Psycho

One of the is stolen from ""A clockwork orange"", the other one is a tarantinoesque idea.The actors are not bad, though, and Andrzej Sekula is a great cinematographer, but for those, who haven't read the original (and otherwise also bad) novel, this is just a cartoon. At least Ellis' (bad) novel had some thought to say. In a wrong way as a matter of fact, but this movie transforms the original material into an empty-minded, ""Alfred Hitchcock presents""-type satire and not into a satirical, but vile experience in darkness, as it should be. If you want to know, how disturbing the novel is, watch the hungarian movie ""Nexxt"" instead. It's not an adaptation, but it's a lot closer to the original material and it's also not a great movie, but it is better and a lot more artistic.",American Psycho
835,Chloe_loves_It,Good representation of a serial killer!,8,4 July 2007,"This film was OK really. I mean its not really the masterpiece some people are claiming it to be. Its a matter of opinion really. Its good in the respect that it shows the extent of madness a serial killer reaches before their 'burn out' and just by including a 'burn out' it stays true to the profile of a serial killer. I didn't read the book but I'm sure it was probably better than the film as the books always are! I don't think they could really have anymore gore, it would probably ruin the serious intentions of the film and turn it simply in to a typical American horror/thriller like the remake of 'The Hills Have Eyes' (which I love by the way) where they try to fit as much death, gore and blood in to one sitting without over stepping boundaries with certification. I enjoyed this film and the dark humour was definitely a key to the movies success, without it i don't think i would have watched it past the first half hour.",American Psycho

Christian Bale portrayed his character Patrick Bateman with such elegance, accuracy, and conviction. I was in love with him within 30 minutes. The dark comedy the film gives is absolutely brilliant. There is no other serial killer/slasher movie that can even compare to American Psycho. Between Batemans OCD, lewd murders, and uncanny knowledge for 80's music, he is by far the best since Norman Bates. I recommend this film to everyone, even if you don't watch horror. I have seen this film at least 100 and I own it, so as you can tell it's just plain GREAT!!",American Psycho

This is just the second movie to do so, the first time being when I was probably 7 or 8, had seen a horror movie and had a nightmare. I won't be able to sleep for a month if I read the book.American Psycho is is about this Harvard graduated multi-millionaire, who has inherited his father's business. Patrick Bateman is a guy obsessed with having the best looks, apartment, business card!, ..all the material pleasures. Just like the book the story is narrated in first person, an account of how he spends in day getting through work hours and how he is a serial killer by night. The murders are graphic and the sex scenes are brutal. The murders after the sex scenes are both. Chainsaw, axes, knives... some of the few. Brilliant performance by Bale, so many characteristics portrayed together: arrogance, obsession, passion(for murders), remorse(at the end), and so many more.But the part part is the end. Don't wanna reveal anything about it, but you will be thinking about it for a long long time after you've seen this movie the first time. A must watch for any movie buff!",American Psycho
838,80sgal,"a misunderstood film, I think",8,16 June 2003,"I think a lot of people took this movie as a straight-up psycho, hacking up women kind-of movie, and that's unfortunate.  To me, this movie is a satire of corporate/upper middle class life, and actually gets to be pretty funny at times when you think about what's really going on (not to give away the end, which actually works for a change).  Watching the main character struggle with trying to fit in, trying to be noticed, and trying to maintain an image of what he thinks his co-workers want him to be, and then having this glaringly contrasted with his inner rage at having to do all this and having it not work so well...there's a great scene when christian bale's character is just seething inside because someone upstaged his new business card...it's perfect. and so funny! unfortunately the satire and necessary humor are downplayed too much at times, and the movie loses its footing, getting a bit too serious and letting the satire (which is its main pull for me) slip away almost entirely at times - like the director couldn't decide what he wanted the film to convey.

The layers of satire and irony are so brilliantly put together they mesmerize the mind. I would not list this movie under the horror section and I think that it's name in a way does it a horrible injustice.  I was hesitant to watch it because I thought that it was going to be a cheezy horror flick when it was anything but. It's an intelligent commentary on corporate America in the 1980s, about the modern Manhattan buoguesie (spelling?). Also I think Christian Bale captures pure Americaness because he's able to see us from an objective point of view.  Seeing this movie may make you rethink your values and priorities in life.  If you liked movies such as Fight Club, Quills, Happiness, and Welcome to the Dollhouse I think you'd most likely like this movie too.",American Psycho

841,sam69,HIghly original and darkly amusing.,8,18 August 2002,"This film was i feel highly underated, and deserved a lot more praise. Patrick Bateman is easily one of the best characters in cinema, his lack of remorse and emotion is funny and yet scary at the same time. Not as violent as the novel this film implies a lot of the gory goings on instead of showing them, which makes it more superior than the average horror by avoiding the buckets of blood. The script is provided with enough comical scenes to make this similar to Scream only darker and more intelligent. Also the encorperated soundtrack makes the movies main character even more amusing in certain scenes, watch the film and you will know what i mean.
A great movie that should be seen and watched very carefully to avoid missing anything.",American Psycho
842,frederik_meuwissen,sloppy,7,4 May 2009,"I found American Psycho to be rather disappointing. This may have been because of the fact that I built up my expectations too high, or because of the fact that this is a compelling theme that deserved more of an explanation and a more thorough study of Bateman's psyche than the film actually offered.From the opening credits 'till somewhere halfway the story, i believed that this film had tremendous potential. Halfway trough the movie however, I was forced to revise this opinion, waiting for some explanations of what Bateman is doing or a deeper look into Batemans psyche and what is real and what imaginary. Instead, he just randomly kept murdering girls in random places (the apartment with all the corpses?), strange things happen (Paul Allen's apartment cleaned up all of the sudden by an accusing real estate agent?, Bateman going berserk without any consequences?, Bateman imagining drinking whiskey?) that make you understand that not all of what Bateman does is real, but no explanation is given for this, and we never get to know what in fact is real.By the time I understood that Bateman was imagining certain things, I was hoping that this film would draw to a 'Fight Club ending' and a 'aha-erlebnis'. Instead, it ended with a lot of unanswered questions and a 'Taxi Driver ending', which left a very sour taste and spoiled a movie with heaps of potential.",American Psycho

It is extremely compelling and Christian Bale could'nt have done it any better. He plays great, the character that people were picturing in their heads for 9 years (The time between when the book was released and the movie wasn't). Not only Christian but others as well, such as Reese Witherspoon and much more. This film is one of the best with such an art-house effect to it which really shows Batemans inside of his head. You couldn't know anymore about Bateman after viewing this film, as it goes deeply into every single part, chapter into Batemans mind and life. He really has no other feelings for anyone in his life. Well this film is worth viewing strongly. People may find it silly and weird as some of the stuff is very coincidentally happening. And also the way Bateman acts sometimes. But that just shows his character. So see it now. It is a great movie. One of the best. American Psycho...",American Psycho

846,samurbs,Bale is brilliant in a badly depicted psychological thriller,5,26 February 2012,"Attempting to outline the breakdown in human society, American Psycho is the story of a so-called serial killer and his spiralling journey as he falls deeper into his psychotic state.As a woman, watching the beginning of American Psycho, I thought I had hit jack-pot; Christian Bale, ( thankfully 'Batman' Bale rather than 'The Machinist' Bale), butt naked, oiled up and in a shower. But sadly this mouth-watering ambiance was not to last. After I snapped out of my trance and was engaged back into the words of his character Patrick Bateman, I began to take account of the intense depth of his skin routine, and how this was so focused upon. This was just the beginning of a number of clues pointing towards Bateman's insanity.Together with the monotone narration of Bale's character, the in-depth analysis of what seem to be meaningless aspects such as business cards and skin routines are what makes this film so eerie and odd. The direction and camera work attempt to capture the mess inside Bateman's head, drastically contrasting the atmosphere of the scenes, from a brutal murder scene, straight into massage therapy. By highlighting Batemans obsession with his outer self, it implies that society similarly tries to perfect its outer body to cover the guilt of the uncontrollable nature inside most of us. It attempts to portray how nothing is ever good enough, and that you will always want more, or something else.Bale plays the role brilliantly, twisting and turning his character to depict an 'American Psycho', exactly I imagine as director Mary Harron wished for. At one point he even became so uncontrollably crazy, that he depicted every character that Jim Carrey has ever played, which doesn't say a lot for Jim Carrey, but indeed a lot for Bale! However, as an audience, you never learn to like or relate to any of the characters, which sadly sets you back from the film. If Harron was attempting to describe society as broken, then relating to at least one broken character would have allowed the audience to step into their role, however, not at any point during the film do we feel any closeness to any character. Although Justine Theroux and Josh lucas were brilliantly cast , fitting the parts perfectly of Sexist, Womanising, Businessmen.Perhaps this would have worked better as a TV series, much like Hurron's other work, as the techniques she induces upon this film, would be much more appropriately suited to TV. Adapting this film from a book was a good idea in theory, deep concepts, brilliantly depicted characters and an intriguing plot, but perhaps Hurron was the wrong person for the job, as it just did not work in practise.It may have been captivating, and Bale may have been brilliant, but in all reality, I would have been quite happy just watching the first shower scene! 5/10",American Psycho

I was kind of a man who likes to work hard and compares himself with other successful people. Therefore, I noticed a part of my future personality at Patrick Bateman.

848,gbriles93,A great American horror classic!,10,22 July 2012,"Christian Bale delivers in what is arguably one of the most cultivating and visionary films of the decade. Everything about this film is perfect. The tone, the performances, the psychological message that the movie has and how well it was filmed. All I can say is bravo! While the film is disturbing and extremely graphic, it is depicted as a true film of terror, greed, and how deep down, we can't hide who we really are. In a way, American Psycho strikes me as a combination of Wall Street, the 1987 drama with Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen, and the 2007 horror flick Mr. Brooks starring Kevin Costner and Demi Moore. American Psycho doesn't quite reach my top 10 list of great films but it sure holds a place as a true masterpiece",American Psycho

It's amazing how Mary Harron, manages the association between a typical American businessman high class, with a psychopath. The criminal does not necessarily looks bad, is what wants to tell us. The prejudices of the human mind deceive us. nobody would doubt that a sophisticated man could be a psychopath. I don't know if it happened to someone else, but I felt myself on Bateman's feet, not on victims. this also happens in Hitchcock's films. this film plays with more perverse and hidden mental instincts of human mind. I Celebrate the murder of Paul Allen, without going into moral considerations about what might cause insanity in Bateman.I relaxed myself and simply enjoy this movie full of blood and madness. Caution: a psychopath not necessarily arises because of a conflictive life. Bateman had everything but at the same time he had nothing, he was a rich business man, from Harvard, with an expensive apartment, money, sophisticated taste for music and cooking, good looking, but he realized that he actually had nothing, and that life is fragile and worthless.",American Psycho
851,Rhys_Belding,Deserves a much higher rating.,8,1 February 2014,"American Psycho (2000) - a beautiful movie about a nice rich man called Patrick Bateman who is a banking executive in New York. He has a lot of money so he decides to spend it nicely. He gives money to the homeless, pays for peoples trips to London and even pays for the meals for his colleagues at high-classed restaurants. He also loves to tape everything he does (like a diary). Haha, just kidding (well maybe not about the taping part). American Psycho is a great movie about Patrick Bateman, a psychopathic killer who kills regularly for pleasure but also because feels he he needs to. This movie is very powerful and the acting is brilliant. The introduction instantly got me hooked due its the beautifully artistic shots and the film continued to be very good throughout and even made me laugh in places. The acting was also fantastic from the majority of the cast. This is a great movie and is definitely worth a watch. Just don't show him your personalized business card.

The only point I want to make is this - if you have seen the film and not read the book, read the book! The film actually enhances the book, because you find yourself reading in Christian Bales' voice. It sounds strange, I know, but it happens. I really enjoyed reading the book again. The choice of scenes to leave out and those to briefly touch upon was obviously deliberated. I feel that the right decision was made. The film isn't short, but it doesn't drag either. My favourite scene is where he tells Evelyn that he has to return some videotapes. Bale gives someone off-screen the ultimate don't-mess-with-me look, for no apparent reason. It's the small things he does in the performance which truly makes it one of the best of all time! I really hope a special edition is released after the new Batman film launches him to where he belongs. A true masterpiece of an adaptation. Superb!",American Psycho
853,heckubiss,lame attempt at portraying a real psychopath,5,11 May 2005,"*****Warning contains spoilers********** I saw this last night on showcase expecting it to be a more realistic portrayal of the serial killer / psychopath epoch but instead what we got was a movie which had a surreal / comic book character to it. It is as if the whole movie was a dream. But it wasn't..I say this for the following reasons:Bateman's personality was a little to strange for a psychopath. It is as if the director was trying too hard. A little more subtlety would have been better. IE when he has the prostitutes over at his apartment and goes on that monologue about phil collins. Or the parts when he is talking to the investigator and seems visibly disturbed or uneasy, and the detective is completely oblivious. A common misconception is that psychopath is someone who is insane. The only difference between a psychopath and a non-psychopath is that a psychopath does not empathize with other people. Though a lot of them will learn to ""fake it"" over the years. In its extreme case, they will see another person as no different than an object. The part when Bateman made reference to Ed Gaines is a classic: ""Ed Gains would see a girl and think two different things. I can take this girl out and show her a good time, or I can cut her head off"". The other part I found totally ridiculous, was how Batemen committed all those over the top murders of people and all the other background characters seemed oblivious. Again I think the director was really trying to hard. especially at the end when he kills the old woman, the police officers (which just happened to be parked next to a gas tank which causes a huge explosion!?!? wtf!? ) the guard etc. etc..I can go on and on about psychopaths, and why it was appropriate for Bateman to be a CEO as research has shown that psychopaths often do well in leadership roles etc. bottom line, this is a very weak movie with an even weaker ending.",American Psycho

The issue is William Dafoe. Not that his acting is bad, it is just he practically did nothing in the movie. I think it would be better If he caught Patrick Bateman, or got killed by him or any other surprise/twist. What I mean is: What's the point of having William Dafoe in a movie if you are not gonna use him correctly. It is too much talent wasted in this character. Excluding that part, the rest of the film is almost perfect, great and memorable acting from Christian Bale. if it wasn't for this film, he would never been my favorite actor. To be honest I liked much more is acting in this movie than in ""The Dark knight"", I think this one, he's the one he identifies better. A Psycho! I always liked movies about psychopaths and this one did not disappointed me, if there wasn't the masterpiece by Sir Alfred Hitchcock named Psycho, then this would have been my favorite serial killer movie, better than Silence Of The Lambs in my opinion.

856,cetuh,American Psycho is a movie with a twist.,9,30 October 2015,"The movie ""American Psycho"" is a manic tale of a businessman who is trying to further himself in his position. Patrick Bateman, The American Psycho, is a man who is seemingly descending further into madness. As the story progresses, Patrick progressively commits acts of murder and other heinous acts as he slowly kills more and more prominent figures, from a distraught and suffering homeless man to a fellow business partner that would obviously be noticed if they went missing. His madness intensifies to the point that he went on a psychotic rampage, even to the point of trying to shove a cat into a ATM machine. The characters in the movie besides the main character all show the consistent greed and selfish attitude that's common for the businessmen Patrick was surrounded by. Patrick was shown to not fit in as well, joking about grotesque things that unsettled most people or just talking about murder lightly. Patrick Bateman was shown to have a blatant disregard for the feelings and opinions of others in matters he felt he knew best which happened to be most things, even going as far as murdering some for their ignorance. The movie shows an intense spiral into madness but also an interesting side to the movie when at the end of the movie ,it shows that he might have just imagined the events of the movie or perhaps fantasized them when the coworker he killed in his apartment with an axe was shown to be alive and coming back from a business trip. This twist and how it's presented leaves me with the feeling that this movie deserves a 9/10. My only few gripes with the movie is that it doesn't show his coworker alive again to solidify his existence or survival. It also doesn't show who Patrick truly killed or if he killed anyone at all during that scene or otherwise.",American Psycho

How boring it was. And how cringing the dire performance by Christian Bale was.He seemed to have adopted a Jim Carrey persona. While Jim is funny. Bale is not. The mannerisms, the voice, everything sucks about Bale.And the story? What story. There is none. It's just a collection of disjointed scenes, mixed with violence and murder - to quote Shakespeare - 'signifying nothing.'Also, Bale is only 26 in this movie. At times he looks mid 40s.It's a pile of trash I would not recommend to my worst enemy. One of the most overrated films of all time.Just 1/10 and I am being generous.",American Psycho
858,ajdepola,I was blown away,10,13 January 2019,"The film stars Patrick Bateman, a 27-year-old man who is a wealthy stock broker on wall street although we don't really see him work rather we see him going out to restaurants and other places as he hangs out with co-workers. The story is about Bateman going through life as you or I would but there's a catch; he's a serial killer, throughout the film we see Bateman kill random people and we also see the aftermath of some of his kills.during the opening after a bar scene where he openly admits to wanting to kill a young woman who is bartending but she doesn't hear him due to the music being too loud we get a description of his day to day life. He mentions all of the skin care products he uses to look young his rigorous diet and exercise routine and even saying ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman"" so we can already tell he's not all there but seems like a normal guy on the outside.The film is set on the 1980s so we see people openly snorting cocaine and smoking without any problems. What surprised me the most was when I found out a woman directed this film now I'm not trying to be sexist in fact I think anyone can direct a great film regardless of who you are but it shocked me because of how Bateman treats women. Along with the murders Bateman has women come to his house so he can have sex with them and he even films a session with him flexing at his muscles in the mirror while with two women, now that doesn't seem too bad but right after when they're sleeping the women are ready to leave but Bateman makes them stay saying ""We're not finished yet"" as he takes out a coat hanger out of a drawer as he does we see that he has many different instruments. The films cut's to Bateman letting them out and we see the first girl with cuts on the back of her shoulder and a bloody nose and the other leaving angerly only saying later on that she had to go to the emergency room afterward.The whole film is chock full of weird disturbing imagery but that shouldn't drive you away because Christian Bale delivers a stellar performance and you really feel and believe that he's a psychopath. A little heads up for those who aren't the best with gore be wary that there is a very plentiful amount of blood and gore hence the R rating but I hope whoever watches this really enjoys it, it's definitely one that you won't forget.",American Psycho
859,CarpeDiem12,Have You Seen My New Business Card?,8,13 March 2018,"It's an interesting movie. Not a slasher movie like i expected. Its a psychotic thriller. It gets the idea of a man who thinks he is a perfect illusion of himself. It creates a brand of a man called Patrick Bateman. He is wealthy, handsome, charming and has a great job and prides himself on it. But he has one flaw, he gets extremely jealous and loses himself. Thus comes the psychotic homicidal part of him.He is jealous of competition and thus kills competition like how animals would and gets on with his daily routines. There is humor in the movie as Bateman draws his enemies/victims into him and gets off on the homicidal behavior. Christian Bale does a wonderful Job in this movie. He captures and carries the performances well that you do believe this character and are invested in his story. It's so wonderfully acted that even if you didn't like the movie you would like his performance.",American Psycho

It's just so twisted, crazy and psycho as a movie just can get. I've seen this movie at least a dozen times and I just can't get enough. There's something terrifying but also fascinating in this masterpiece. I like the way Christian Bale turns pretty-boy Patrick Bateman into a psychotic killer and finally over-comes his image as decent guy from next door. Great example of it is that his own psychologist wont even believe him.. He hides his bodies and finally gets away clean. Anyway I'm a huge fan of Christian Bales and I think that this is one of his best! But also movies like Equilibrium, El Maquinista, Reign of fire and of course Batman Begins are good. Christian Bale is just the kind of an actor who does a lot for his character. Can you imagine someone who could act Batman/ Bruce Wayne, Patrick Bateman or priest John Preston better than him.

You'll end up saying to yourself ""What?!?"" and wondering what, if any, message the movie was trying to put across. Any person that thinks it's trying to ridicule the 80s power hungry business community is digging too deep for meaning.

To think that Leonard Dicaprio was even considered for this role is, to me at least, unfathomable.  He lacks the depth that Bale gives the part.  Also, Reese Witherspoon plays Bale's girlfriend and really shines in the short time she is in the film.  The story is well written and the casting is superb.  This is a great period piece as well...You have got to love the Eighties and the materialistic consumerism that goes along with it.

874,loomis2001,A movie you'll hate to love,10,14 April 2000,"American Psycho is by far one of the best films of the year. Many critics and some viewers are claiming that the film is shallow and pathetic...exactly right. And that's the stunning beauty of it all. AP is so deep its shallow and vice versa.Christian Bale (in a trying-way-too-hard American accent) does a top-notch job playing Patrick Bateman, a rich New York Wall-Streeter who lives an utterly empty life. His fiance (the always excellent Reese Witherspoon)is a drip, his friends are drones, and even the people he passes on the street seem to be pathetic, soulless creatures.Finally, we see that Patrick DOES find a way of escaping all of this 80s nonsense...through random acts of hideous violence. The first shocking killing, involving a homeless man and (gasp!) his dog, jolts the audience with its intensity..and humor. Patrick's murders (while not that graphic) make you squeemish because the director has done such a superb job of making them FUNNY. You're laughing as people are chased with axes, nail guns, chainsaws, etc. This is BLACK COMEDY at its finest. You hate yourself for loving every delicious moment of mayhem.The overall point to the story is that in the world of excess, a heavy price of being ""not there"" comes along with all of the wonderful restaurant reservations and business cards with gold lettering. Some may say the meaning is shallow and overplayed, but I truly think the filmmakers accomplish what they set out to do...show that everyone has to find their identity somehow...and hopefully it won't be in the psychotic ways that Bateman does.One final note...unlike the similar in message Fight Club, this one's twist ending is NOT a total betrayal to the entire movie. It really works and even drives the film's message further!grade: 10/10------one of this year's best",American Psycho

When I sat down to watch the movie, I noticed that in a lot of places it was word-for-word with the book, but the scenes were all out of context...didn't work well. The movie was a black comedy, a far stretch from the book. I know that murder and rape scenes must be cut back for the movie, but it just took away from the whole story line.

The urinal cake scene from the book would have been a wonderfully comic/cruel addition to the film, if it weren't for the fact that the entire movie comes off as comic/cruel.

Patrick Bateman consumes himself with self loathing and, in the end, is ultimately revealed to be even more empty, vacuous and incapable when the denouement of the film reveals that he does not even have the substance to have done what he fantasises about.You can speculate endlessly about the artistic, psychological, or otherwise angles - what counts is that THIS FILM HAS SUCH A HIGH IMPACT and pace about it, and such a strong central character that it draws you into fascination and captivation even though its fairly disgusting if you think about it whilst eating your lunch or something like that.I'd recommend it if you like stuff like Cronenburg.

No backstory of the characters is provided and we are left to deduce for ourselves the killer's motivation for perpetrating his crimes, i.e., living a spiritually empty and unsatisfying existence?

It gives a vision on the American (or more common, the Western) culture. Bateman represents the society. He is superficial, selfish, cold-hearted and lets other people die (and even enjoys it).

887,maximeslaperle,a great movie that delves in the psyche of man,9,21 December 2006,"Sometimes, I cannot amaze myself enough of how a female director can understand the mind of men, so eloquently. In such, this is one of those violent movies that breathes a certain plastic beauty about it. It's not the kind of a plastic beauty that comes from a Scorsese movie, for Scorsese uses editing purposes to achieve that. For Mary Harron, this could be for her of a defining picture. It seems so good, that it relatively has no flaws. But we have not probably yet seen the full capacity of Harron as a director, the masterpiece could still be in the works. What intrigues me is the very ""how"" of what makes her actually tick about men, despite the fact that American Psycho is an adaptation of an painstakingly horrible book written by Brett E. Ellis. It explains the huge difference it can make from one medium to another. To be honest from it's own writing style, it's a very sh--ty book. Not even amusing for one single bit. You throw it out even after ten pages. It looks likes Harron can be very faithful to the novel's mentality, but adding on her foremost philosophy on men, coming from her own views. The movie is very crude in depicting the nothingness of male yuppies, living in the dystopia of N.Y. Everybody knows that new-yorkers are despicable bastards on their own time. And this shows this stereotype as it was evident, like morning daylight. Rich people don't have a speck of guilt in their whole f---ing beings, bourgeois and ignorant a--holes, who act like they own everybody, even the bums. This is what makes this movie bring out the just psychosis of it all. You absolutely need to see this movie,a must.

I do fully agree with the comment of ""grendel-37"" made in 2001, though the only part i have a different opinion is the ending of the film. I believe, there enough hint given as what happen To Bateman, it is what he chooses to do! Because ""his layer HAS BEEN IN London"" that night when he killed his competing colleague; in fact he was not! And that explains that he is not going in jail for his murders! And this ending is anxious for Bateman, because he just had a catharsis and now when is going to be the next one!? And i think that terrifies him, as he acknowledges it in some movie sequence!And I do thoroughly, completely agree that the Directing is stunning... One more thing that entirely blew me away was camera work! Hitchkogian Cinematography! Brilliant!",American Psycho

890,jessbarga,"A pretty loser, but NOT a murderer.",8,26 April 2001,"Please note, spoilers follow.I am bemused reading through many of these reviews: not one person has stated succinctly that Patrick Bateman is NOT A SERIAL KILLER. Psychopathic or ""psycho"" he may or may not be; the definition of that term has become ambiguous due to massive pop usage.  But during this film he does not murder a soul.Throughout the film I was absorbed though not decisively impressed.  Fairly well-acted, I thought, though irritatingly plastic and shallow in most spots.  And prettily done: sharp lines, chiseled physiques, alluring dishes at various chic minimalist restaurants.  But surely there must be a point; what can it be?  The movie is clearly not about psychopaths and their mentality, it is about the 80's and superficiality.  Then by what many reviewers have called ""a true cop-out of an ending"" or ""the weakest ending imaginable"", the movie was validated for me.  Bateman had in fact not committed any of the murders so mechanically and attractively (if I'm not psycho myself for using that adverb) portrayed in the film.  Bateman was, though mentally disturbed for certain and delusional of course, simply too lame to follow through with the murders he passionately imagined.
Others have cited his ""inability to receive recognition"" for his crimes. No, that's not it!  He didn't commit the crimes, don't you see?  They were fantasies.  They were cherished illusions, delusions, dreams, whatever you want to call them.  It's pretty clear, though debatable, that he believed in them all the while, which marks him as a clear mental case.  But Patrick was an unreliable narrator, and we were fools to assume that his visions coincided with whatever objective reality the director was putting forth. Specifics?  Well, beyond the fact that the police didn't nab him easily after his last shooting spree, there are the facts that the attorney had seen Paul Allen in London (this could be chalked up to the recognition gimmick, but not correctly, I don't think), and his visit to Allen's old apartment, barren of carcasses, blood, or crime-scene effects.Given the fact that the crimes were just dreams, this movie makes a great deal more sense to me.  Bateman's character epitomizes his crowd: weak, empty, shallow, void of all human qualities.  He is too weak and empty to affect others' lives in any true fashion, and this includes affecting their deaths.  He's the lamest of the lame.  And THAT'S the point of American Psycho -- not a brilliantly original point, but neither a senseless parade of misogyny and murder.",American Psycho

In fact, the existence of such elements are open to interpretation and end up showing exactly why this film needs to be understood more, if not understood properly.Christian Bale has a star-turning and career best performance as a man struggling inside with his thoughts about the environment he lives in. That is where the mental illnesses he displays come from. If you want to see a professional actor at his best, this is the performance you can rely on.As for the film's direction from Mary Harron, she did an excellent job bringing the essence of Bret Easton Ellis's novel on which the screenplay is based to the screen, with some important missing factors which are probably the result of content or budget restrictions imposed by the producers.This is my favourite film because of the beauty and significance of its message, which will only increase over time as far as my interpretation of the world is concerned.Do not be swayed by a precocious judgement of this film.

This movie is smart and you can watch it 50 times and still miss the jokes. Anyone who actually reads this comment come away with one thing-- when watching the movie listen for how Patrick responds to Jean's compliment about him looking good in the morning. His response is hilarious, if you don't find it funny you should just give up on trying to enjoy life. That is all I have to say ..

895,history818,Horror film of American Materialist Society,8,6 November 2006,"I first saw this film in the theater and left shaking my head in confusion. Some time later I saw the movie again, and thereafter I have watched it dozens of times (each time picking up on something I never noticed before).Christian Bale plays an Ivy League graduate working at a prestigious firm in mid-80's New York. He has everything going for him: perfect looks, perfect job, perfect apartment, perfect fiancé played by Reese Witherspoon, but for every perfect element in his life comes a comparison to someone else with better looks (he is often compared another person as a mistaken identidy in which he is offended. Not even his lawyer calls him by the right name), better job (although they are all VP's of the company, yet Jared Leto's character for example always gets the ""good accounts""), better apartment (more expensive, better location), or a better fiancé (Samantha Mathis' character being engaged to a seemingly obvious homosexual).Everything Bale and the rest of the cast of characters do revolves around ""fitting in"". The night clubs, the coke habits, the luncheons at the best restaurants. In a large part of the scenes we see how society at that time behaves ($500 or so for a lunch in which they all say ""not bad"" and each provide a credit card, the memorable business card comparison scene which nearly gives Bale a heart attack). Culture and materialism is picked a part in the movie in a very comedic way.Bale spends most of his time pretending to be someone he's not (fake smiles, fake enjoyment at a Christmas party). However, the movie portrays that in his off time he is picking up hookers only to sleep with them (with praise of his good fortune expected) only to find himself enraged and compelled to murder his victims. Not limited to woman hating, he acts out on his jealousy towards a co-worker all while playing Huey Lewis soundtracks as he seems to be passionate about his 80's music and culture. A homeless man and various animals are even incorporated into his list of victims.He is able to withstand temptation of his ""friends"" and more surprisingly his secretary who he invites on a date only to let her leave unscathed. William Dafoe plays a detective who catches him in his lies and confusion.The film ends in a very eerie way as we don't know if any of the experiences with Bale were real or in his mind. He went from odd behaving to absolutely crazy and the facts are not even facts, but scattered thoughts or undefined realities.It's one of the few ""horror"" films I couldn't help but chuckle at throughout the entire sick and twisted duration.",American Psycho

Harron's direction is very impressive as she manages to take the story through the narrow route that blurs the line between fiction and reality with great finesse. American Psycho is a fascinating vignette of lunacy and obsession as it intriguingly blends its elements of horror and dark comedy into an exquisitely paced, masterfully directed and magnificently written story that delves into the mind and psyche of its incredibly deranged individual with plenty of success, and remains one of the finest achievements of its genre(s) and of the greatest movies of the 2000s.",American Psycho

I would never have expected him to be so good at it.The way the screenplay puts the film in the point-of-view of Bateman, from his violent acts, his denial of his sanity, and his inner conflict to not be caught,keeps the movie fresh and suspenseful. You may consider the ending controversialThe direction and other production areas of this film, make a final product much better (in my opinion), than most of the popular Horror/Thriller/Slasher films of all time, While keeping it realistic and modern-time relate-able.American Psycho, in the end, is one of the best suspense movies i have ever seen.

In my view he doesnt kill a single person but that doesnt matter thats not what this film is about.  Its psycological.  I dont want this to sound obnoxious but if you did not enjoy this film it's because you didnt understand it. Give it another go.  Look for the way Bateman portrays a false image within his vanity and how two faced the business men are to each other.  These men are rich but look at there relationships, money cant buy these men true friends and loyalty.  They all treat each other simply as formalities.

Smacked in the middle is wall Street Buisnessman Patrick Bateman. He wears expensive suits, is pedantic about taking care of his body and constantly tries to get a reservation at the trendy restaurant Dorsia. But underneath the surface, Patrick Bateman is a shell. He may have flesh, blood skin and bone, but inside, he is simply not there. He describes hi,self only being able to feel two emotions, greed and disgust, two feelings which drive him to commit acts of gruesome violence in the night.Patrick Bateman is played perfectly by Christian Bale, who earlier had been in ""Empire of The Sun"" by Steven Spielberg. He gives the character depth and humor and gives excellent speeches, on one hand delivering sick remarks in ordinary conversations, and on the other recollecting careers of Pop-stars such as Huey Lewis and the News, Genesis and Whitney Houston. Patrick's equally shallow friends are played by Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas and Bill Sage among others. Patrick's supposed fiancée is played by Reese Witherspoon who does an annoying portrait of a woman who only cares about what people think of her. But she is supposed to be annoying, so it's okay. Cloe Sevigny plays Jean, Patrick secretary who has a crush on him. She is the only not shallow person in this story, which is probably why Patrick cant bring himself to kill her. Jared Leto also makes an appearance as Paul Allen, the only one of Patrick's acquaintances who can get a reservation at Dorsia. This, plus the fact that he has a better looking business card is probably why he gets an Axe smacked in his face by Bateman.This movie, despite the aspect of the murders, is very funny. Hilarious scenes such as Chrsitian Bale's moonwalk during a murder scene, or a three-some where he flexes in the mirror during the act are stacked on each other, and you will find yourself laughing out loud during several scenes.The translation from Bret Easton Ellis masterful novel is done great, and a lot of the things in the book are in the Movie, with the exception of the most gruesome scenes (who i wont mention here). Several Narrating speeches are in.Conclusion, a brilliant piece of cinema, with great performances all around. Oh, and i almost forgot Willhelm Dafoe's character, the PI Donald Kimball. He gives of a very creepy vibe, and makes both the audience and Bateman feel nervous. Awesome performance.""Do you like Huey Lewis And The News?""10/10",American Psycho
904,badguyriddlar,Exploration of Disconnect,7,13 May 2021,"On surface level, the movie is about a man with a lavish routine who also leads a double life as a serial killer. But the signs of Bateman's disconnect from society as revealed in the ending is the key to truly understanding the film.It focuses on Bateman's high levels of narcissism and toxic masculinity which are all questioned when his fragile ego is broken over mundane situations. This film does a wonderful job portraying the mental state of people like Bateman who are disillusioned by their status and how they view the rest of the world. In addition, the comedic, exaggerated events that occur are quite entertaining.",American Psycho

906,jjjjjj-18,I believe people like this movie because they think they are supposed to like this movie,5,2 December 2009,"I was looking forward to see this one after reading a lot of positive comments about this one in IMDb....Now that i have seen it, i am posting a comment because I want to do my bit in helping any other prospective viewer from seeing this.First of all...i will admit this is NOT a bad movie...but it is not a movie you want to look forward to either....I have said this is NOT a bad movie, because I could sit through the movie without getting too bored. I kept on waiting for the ""good parts"" until the end of the movie.Let me also tell you that for any movie reading a book should not be a pre-requisite....if there is , then that is a flaw with the movie.The movie deals with a psychotic character Patrick Baleman who hides his psychotic part from his co-workers and friends(?)....In reality Bateman has no friends, everyone is superficial...As the movie progresses Bateman's veil of sanity slowly falls off....When you watch the movie, you are unable to interpret what is real and what is imaginary....The film depicts how these could co-exist.....It depicts the movie from the view-point of a psychotic So why did i find it boring???? 1)Because there were no clear explanation of why Bateman became a psychotic....it is not necessary that a movie explains this...but I find it interesting only if that is explained...Then the movie can be enjoyed ....You find fun to see a mind unravel...FightClub is a good example...Apart from the fact that FightClub deals with a more ""visually interesting"" psychiatry case viz MPD....there is a proper logical explanation of the main character became a psychotic....not the case with American Psycho....Add to this the fact the condition he suffers from is not a very ""visually stimulating"" one and that it is in fact depicted in a boring fashion, makes it a forgettable movie experience.Let me give you an analogy....People enjoy playing chess, its fun to use our mind designing strategies...Its even fun to watch a game of chess....You find it fun to watch the moves, how one player uses a strategy and how the other counters it....But can u enjoy a game of chess if you don't understand whats going on -if the game goes above you head(like if two top level players are playing)....Now imagine a situation where two fools are playing it...Again u can't find it interesting to watch their game....u don't get it, because there is nothing to get!!!! I don't see where is the fun in knowing just that Bateman is paranoid...Afterall you are seeing American Psycho and Mateman himself declares from the start that ""I am mad"" 2)Also because..some psychiatry oriented themes can be interesting even if u don't get an explanation of the psychosis...if the premise is interesting...""Identity"" is a good example, there is no explanation as to why there is the disease per se.....but the premise was interesting...In American Psycho there is no premise, because the boundaries between real an imaginary is not clear...You see hallucination after hallucination or delusion after delusion...interspersed with reality -but you don't know which is which and you soon loose interest (atleast I did) In short I found nothing interesting with American Psycho I believe people find it interesting because they think this is a masterpiece and you are supposed to like it.One guy has said (in another comment) American Psycho is fascinating because Bateman is a complex character..yes it is complex...its more than complex it is psychotic, but not interesting....I don't find it interesting to know that how a psychotic can exist with a a very thin superficial mask of sanity....Here i think the director is at fault or the writer of the book...that they failed to make it interesting.....Why would anyone want to know about someone just because he is psychotic The only thing I found interesting in American Psycho was to note how Bateman's co-workers could be so indifferent to his problems...in fact they don't even realize there is a problem!!!!!",American Psycho
907,waldolc,A good film that could have been great.,6,19 January 2014,"If you haven't seen the film yet, after 14 years since it's release, be prepared for spoilers. The soundtrack is mostly distracting. Except for when you know that Patrick is listening to the same thing as us - the viewers - the soundtrack seems to want you to believe that this is the music that everyone listened to during the 1987 and it didn't matter who they were. Even trying to believe that this is Patrick's soundtrack, I found him boring and cliché. Truly, the soundtrack did not live up to the personality of the main protagonist and who he believed himself to be. The theatrical release of this film was edited poorly as you get to the conclusion : at no point is the big reveal, well, big. It seems like an afterthought. It leads to confusion, not the great, ""A ha!"" You are never given the opportunity to rehash the film and understand that it was mostly in Patrick's head. The only other downfall for this film would be that given the satirical tone, most of the time the satire was boring. Christian Bale was fine as were the other actors. The cinematography top notch. But for what must be a heavily edited film, I did like it.",American Psycho

I can't write much about this film without referencing the great scenes which carried it (the Paul Allen-Bateman interaction is excellent), but since I will do my best to avoid spoiler-status, it is a film that should be watched at least a second time to fully enjoy the evolving introduction to Patrick Bateman!",American Psycho
909,omgpressure,Enjoyable.,6,16 August 2007,"American Psycho is a very elegantly produced film. It features some excellent photography, and it's a gripping experience. It is not a film that will one-day be seen as a classic of cinema, but it is enjoyable and entertainingly obscene, watching ""American Psycho"" is like witnessing a bravura sleight-of-hand feat. In adapting Bret Easton Ellis's turgid, gory 1991 novel to the screen, the director Mary Harron has boiled a bloated stew of brand names and butchery into a lean and mean horror comedy classic. The transformation is so surprising that when the movie's over, it feels as if you've just seen a magician pull a dancing rabbit out of a top hat. Four years ago Ms. Harron's film ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" performed similar magic by creating credible facsimiles of Warhol and his motley entourage. ""American Psycho,"" a more ambitious, far more confident film, salvages a novel widely loathed for its putative misogyny and gruesome torture scenes by removing its excess fat in a kind of cinematic liposuction. Except for a few wittily chosen lists, the book's numbing catalog of high-end consumer items has been drastically edited. Its murder rate has also plunged. The trimming demonstrates once again that less is often more. What remains of the story is a sleek, satirical, yuppie-era ""Jekyll and Hyde"" that blithely tap dances along the fault lines separating movie genres. At the heart of the film is a star-making performance by the handsome Welsh actor Christian Bale (adopting an impeccably snooty pseudo-preppie American accent) that softens the novel's portrait of a serial-killing Wall Street hotshot just enough to force us to identify with this ultimate narcissist. Mr. Bale's portrayal of 27-year-old Patrick Bateman, a budding master of the universe by day (he works in mergers and acquisitions, which he facetiously refers to as ""murders and executions"") and homicidal maniac by night, is alternately funny, blood-curdling and pathetic. American Psycho is not for all tastes, but for ones that enjoy a good thriller and can stomach blood curdling violence.",American Psycho
910,pushpamsingh,Movie wasn't convincing..lot of flaws,3,15 July 2012,"Well it wasn't a typical Christian Bale stuff. Movie starts in a narrative manner where he is detailing about his specifics to audience. He is VP in a big company but he doesn't appear to be doing even a bit of job like a VP would do for the company. I am sure company is not paying him for just going to pubs, bars and women. Nevertheless biggest flaw of the movie was while he was killing people, police was almost absent from the scene. Is it possible for a guy to kill someone in a apartment premises and have not even one policeman come and inquire into that? hard to believe.... It looked as if he is just doing anything he is wanting to. Even at the end when he was talking to Lawyer about Paul Ellen, it wasn't clear if he really killed him or all this was just illusion? if he didn't kill him then whose body was he carrying. Well movie was not at all convincing.",American Psycho
911,shawnroy,Brilliant film!,10,16 April 2002,"This movie was one of a handful in my life that I actually went to the trouble of convincing friends that they HAD to see this movie. It succeeds on many levels: dark comedy, social commentary, psychological case study. Acting and direction are first class. So many subtle little details that I caught the second or third time I saw it that eluded me initially. I've read many comments/reviews that decry the lack of a plot, but it didn't seem ""plotless"" when I was sucked into it. By contrast, I've seen many supposedly ""excellently written"" movies (e.g. ""In The Bedroom"") that left me cold. The ending did leave me a little perplexed (I can still remember pestering my girlfriend to tell me the ""true"" ending for hours afterwards), but that's just part of the movie's charm: it will not be type-cast. This movie isn't for everyone, but if you're smart, open-minded, and a little warped, you'll love it. One of my all-time favorites. 10 out of 10.",American Psycho
912,samlnhrd,Understand that it's a dark comedy,8,11 December 2013,"Upon my first viewing of American Psycho, I was deeply disturbed. I was left feeling empty and disgusted by the violent and unsympathetic tale of Bale's character. Of course, my opinion has since changed, and it is actually one of my all-time favorites. What I didn't realize from my first viewing of this film is that American Psycho isn't really a ""drama"" or a ""horror-thriller"". It's actually a dark comedy, and an insanely quotable one at that! After multiple viewings, the movie actually felt very light-hearted in a strange, twisted way. It's intention was to be over the top and poke fun at the upper-class. Christian Bale's performance initially left me feeling sick to my stomach, but that is only proof of the man's talent. The character of Patrick Bateman doesn't kill people because he has to, he kills people because he enjoys it. Christian Bale made me believe he enjoyed his murder spree. I'd hate to know how he prepared for this role! Bale's co-stars do a great job too, with solid performances from a few well known actors (Reece Witherspoon, Jered Leto, and William Defoe), and many lesser known actors. The entire cast and crew did a great job of bringing the audience into a world where greed and selfishness is the forefront of this familiar society. The world that director Marry Harron created is merely a parodied reflection of our own society. We live in a time when people are more concerned with their own public-image than the well-being of others. American Psycho found a way to make us laugh about it.",American Psycho

915,davidquinn_1,A Profound Work of Art,10,24 June 2009,"When I saw this movie, I saw my boss in the protagonist. The line about ""I am not even there"", the deadpan, the utter ruthlessness. And a successful financial professional. Some commenters think he's just a symbol. I know he actually exists, just as depicted.They don't all commit murder. Or maybe they all do. I wouldn't know. The best ones cover it up successfully. Those who know, don't find it in their interest to tell.The ending is not ambiguous. It is clear from the paint and redecoration in the apartment, exactly where the corpses and body parts were, that it's being covered up. It's probably someone buying the place for cheap because of all the gruesomeness there, fixing it up with paint and carpet, then selling it for more money while forgetting to mention its past.Therefore of course the people redecorating the apartment want our hero out. He's looking around carefully at the sensitive areas, maybe he knew something about the murders. It doesn't help them for him to be there.The lawyer doesn't want to know all that stuff either. It doesn't help him to know it. He's the same sort of guy after all.Nobody cares about the people who were killed. Nobody worries about whether this guy is a killer, because it doesn't help them, and maybe they too are killers. Life and the fight continue.That's how it is in that world.

917,predator233,Totally unexpected classic,10,27 January 2003,"Having read the book, and thoroughly enjoyed it, I have come up with an order in which to partake of them:1.Watch the film. 2.Read the book 3. Watch the film.In short, watch the movie to help you visualise the book, read the book to help you understand the movie, then sit back and question your own sanity as you actually laugh at the poignant Eighties Satire throughout. It makes Reese Witherspoons acting seem a lot less wooden for one, but the one thing that reading the book did for my appreciation of the film was to let me know things the film just didnt have the time or space to do-like the history of Patricks family, most notably the fact that he has a brother, who is so similar to Paul Allen (or Owen as the book would have us believe) in many respects, that Batemans reasons for not killing his own brother are as shallow and meaningless as himself-suitably hilarious too, but I wont spoil it for you.But is it any good? Oh yes. It is very, very good. If not for being the first movie to incorporate Robert Palmer into its soundtrack, then for its sheer visual impressiveness, the crisp feel of the restaurant linen portrayed ON SCREEN! It looks fabulous, and the plot is, albeit shortened from the book, a very immersive one, with an ending as killer as the main protagonist.A resounding 9/10 from me.",American Psycho
918,williamcouper,Best movie I have ever seen in my life.,10,9 April 2013,"I can understand why people wont like this movie, people who watch movie just for a quick distraction that can't really feel inside the movie or being part of the experience. I first watched this movie after I had a few Whiskey cola back in Boarding school in the late afternoon of April 2010, I couldn't believe that this movie came out ten years ago and I had never heard of it. First of all I thought that Christian Bale was amazing in the role, I loved that you could feel that he really had too much he has the perfect body, he has the perfect apartment, he has the perfect cloths, the best job, the best girls; therefore something is missing in his life he is insane he said but this insanity is just a will to kill to fill what's missing in his life because he already has everything.The writer of the novel said that American Psycho is a funny book it's a comedy, it is that extreme that it is funny, but the book is way way way more violent than the movie. A big confusion that happens is during one of the final scenes when Patrick Bateman goes a bit too far and start killing everybody in the street, cops ecc.... and people were saying that this shows that everything that happens before is fake and he is not capable of killing anyone, but Easton Ellis himself said that the only problem with this movie is that people wont believe that he killed anyone after seeing that scene, and a lot of people really got confused. So to clarify to all: He kills everybody you see, there is no dream or thoughts, everything you see happens in his life for real.What I love about this movie beside the obvious, is the music from the 80s and you really feel there again or nor (i wasn't born yet) and I just love the final monologue.I wish I was him somehow... without the killings ha ha, that would get me in trouble.",American Psycho
919,kumayl_patel-1,A movie about wall street and a psycho being the backdrop!,10,31 December 2003,"By Kumayl Before starting out I would like to give you readers a brief introduction. American psycho was a very extreme and violent novel that was also infact due to its content the most 'controversial' piece of literature ever produced. But what the director has done, she has basically 'toned' down the graphic nature of the book and converted it into a materialistic and worldly psychopath killer: The 80's Wall Street greed.On a personal note, American Psycho is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen! It is truly my favorite film of all time.Now, I know the name Psycho presents material violent in nature but director Mary Harron has portrayed this movie from the innermost feelings exposed directly from the main character being Patrick Bateman outstandingly played by actor Christian Bale.          (Who currently is working on a new `Batman' movie scheduled for release in the summer of 2005).
Patrick Bateman is a complete definition of a perfect young upcoming urban professional, a.ka. `Yuppie'. He has all the characteristics of a human being but not a single clear identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust. All his friends and coworkers talk about is money and Donald Trump and although Patrick tries to embrace these money-oriented issues he simultaneously transforms himself into a sick repulsive madman.
American Psycho teaches us that there can be a Patrick Bateman everywhere. He could be our neighbor, our colleague, a person we brush into while we walk into a supermarket or even a person at Kashmir Road! The fact that we cannot recognize a psychopath is that they easily blend into our society making us think that they are normal. I mean in the final chapters of the book author Bret Easton Ellis shows Patrick Bateman losing his sanity so badly that he resorts to drinking his own urine, sleeping under his futon and eating handfuls of sand on the beach while his fiancé manicures her nails.I wouldn't recommend this movie to people faint of heart or children. This movie is not about killing in any way. Its about how our society itself with all its glamour and greed can make a man transform into a complete sadist slaughterer. It's a movie which will be enjoyed by young people living in the Manhattan atmosphere at where this movie and book's plot is located.",American Psycho
920,dolfin88,What did i just watch...,4,13 July 2014,"i have no freaking idea why the director and writer wanted to do such a movie which the audience enjoyed till the ending and finally ruined it. They could argue that there is a lot beyond what we saw like the modern society, depressed people, attitudes of the people around us and the state of being nothing even if we could get anything in the world. OK we get it but the movie tries to prove something more than that and completely fails. Christian bale has done a fine piece of work in this movie no doubt about that.The character development was fantastic but that's all whats there. The murders, the way of killing them (If its real or not!!) were also made me to continue watching the movie till the end and when i finished it i was like OK let me check that rating in the IMDb once again, was that really a 7 or a 3?.Then somebody told me to read the novel first then i will understand everything, LOL what a pity ,what is this,a harry potter movie ?? where i have to check the relations between the characters and the events that are not in the movie?.

Patrick is indeed fit like a model and does look very well taken care of .. and he did kill everyone in the movie except for the police car and the 2 men in the building ... and the ending suggest that even tho he wanted to get caught even tho he told his friends his lawyers they all took it as a joke for the simple fact that he is a wall street investment broker for instance take the scene when he drag Paul Allen's body thru the lobby with a huge blood trail across the lobby the doorman doesn't suspect anything because of the way Patrick dresses and where he lives. same with the girl at the dry cleaners.. when he says its cranberry juice.. if Patrick had a beard and jeans and a hood on his head I'm sure he would have been caught... appearance is everything... there is a great line in the film when timothy Bryce played by Justin Theroux says about Ronald Reagen look at him on the outside hes just a gentle old man but on the inside... suggesting he hides a deeper character we don't no.. and Patrick Bateman says only to the audience but the inside doesn't matter!!...i simply love this movie and i have only recently discovered it maybe a week ago and i watched it over and over because it leaves allot things for the viewer to not only figure out but to make answers for themselves.. i hope i helped those of you confused on this movie",American Psycho

This movie was great and Christian Bale was amazing.The movie has a big theme of being the best in the work place and the protagonist Patrick Bateman (Bale) strives to be the best and when he isn't he takes the easy way out, which is where his alternate ego comes out and through his own insane fantasies he 'eliminates' the opposition.The way that he does this is one of the greatest ways i've seen. The murder scenes although sometimes bloody and disturbing they also have a comedic prelude of Bateman (Bale) explaining how certain mainstream songs and how much better they are then any other song the artist produced, which in turn made the scenes great.The one problem that I, and I'm sure others had was the last 10- 15minutes of the movie are very confusing and the director, Mary Harron, has a scene which misleads the audience. I don't want to give anything away because this is a must see, but the ending is a little confusing and some post movie research may be required in order to get what the truth behind the plot was.Other then the confusing ending this is a great movie and a must see!All the way from Batemen to Batman, Christian Bale never disappoints.",American Psycho
923,mntaylor98,Excellent film! A darkly comic masterpiece of human consciousness,9,17 February 2012,"American Psycho is an epic mental masterpiece of disturbed human consciousness. At times it as almost hilarious, as much of the situations within the film are so blunt and ludicrous that one cannot help but find them funny. It presents a fascinating perspective of a disturbed man's mind, and society as a whole. Patrick Bateman displays psychotic and homicidal tendencies in plain view of both his fiancée and his coworkers, but they are so engrossed within their own affairs that they take no notice of it, even when he clearly states that he killed ""twenty, maybe forty people"". The ending of the movie is obscure, which can be seen as a positive approach as it allows for the viewer to come to their own conclusions, or a negative approach as it leaves many loose ends within this already strange and incomprehensible film. But whether the viewer chooses to believe that Bateman did in fact brutally murder over a dozen people, or that all of the incidences simply occurred within his restless and unhinged mind, it cannot be denied that this is a fascinating and wildly entertaining tragic masterpiece.",American Psycho

So, apparently, Bateman did *not* commit those murders? And everything had only taken place in his mind? I realize this is something personal of me, other people may love open endings. But I hate them. If only they had added another 15 or 30 minutes to the movie! It wouldn't have mattered too much what direction they chose for the new ending: he could have been committed to the care of psychiatrists, or the realization that he had not killed anyone *yet* could have set him off on a killing spree - either followed by his arrest or not.For me, such an open ending leaves me with a ""what a waste of my time"" sensation. A sensation of being ""cheated"" out of an interesting film too, to some extent. But, again, this is personal. I'm sure that for many people it is a great movie.",American Psycho

926,leedygray,"One of the smartest, funniest movies ever",10,24 June 2007,"'American Psycho' is one of those rare films which stand up to multiple viewings and remain fresh and funny each time. It is a social satire, easily in the league of 'Fight Club' and 'American Beauty,' which points an accusing finger at the rampant materialism and shallow values of 1980s America. Christian Bale gives an absolutely dynamic and hilarious performance as Patrick Bateman, the Wall Street yuppie who masquerades as a businessman/playboy by day and moonlights as a serial killer. The story is embellished with regular voice overs from Bateman, revealing his obsessions with such matters as who is wearing what, who has the best haircut and who has the best business card. Patrick Bateman; ""I'm on the verge of tears as we arrive as Espace... since I'm positive we won't have a decent table. But we do, and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.""Bale plays Bateman like a man who is constantly starring in his own movies - action/adventure, horror, porn and drama; and for whom others in his world are merely co-stars. But like any psychopathic maniac, underneath there is nothing there.'American Psycho' is a perfect viewing experience for those who love an intelligent movie with first rate acting all round. Willem Dafoe makes a classic appearance as the cop who may or may not suspect Patrick; Reece Witherspoon is his shallow, airhead fiancée who is so busy planning the wedding that she doesn't notice that Patrick treats her with total indifference; Jared Leto is Patricks' idiotic Wall Street colleague, and the subject of his homicidal envy (he sports a really funny 80's hairdo); and Chloe Sevigny is Patricks' sweet natured, blindly infatuated secretary.The film is not for those offended by sex or violence (though the violence is not particularly graphic - more implied). I can thoroughly recommend it though, just for Bales performance - which is one of the best I've ever seen in any movie. He is an actor with extraordinary range, who can play the ego-maniacal Patrick Bateman with as much ease as he plays childish innocence (as in 'All the Little Animals).",American Psycho
927,evoorhees77,Bale's Bateman,8,7 February 2019,"American Psycho is one of the few films that appears in both in Chris Stuckmann's book, The Film Buff's Bucket List (top 50 films of 2000 to 2015) and the 100 Movie Bucket List scratch off poster. So I get to mark off two at once! I'm fascinated by Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman. It's a performance that really made me take note of Bale over twenty years ago and he remains an actor to watch to this day. This film is categorized as crime drama, but I've always seen it as a psychological thriller and, I don't know what this says about me, a dark comedy. Now, if you'll excuse me... I have to return some video tapes.",American Psycho
928,hasanricardo786,"brilliant, thought provoking and disturbing.",8,2 December 2012,"okay i am going to concede something first of all- i watched American psycho because Michael c.hall said in an interview that his inspiration for his dexter character( who i absolutely adore because of his different shades) was the character of Patrick Bateman. so my subconscious mind was rather busy finding similarities between the adept and somewhat moralistic serial killer dexter and erratic, lunatic and 'driven to the edge of emptiness by the greed and mechanic corporate world' serial killer Bateman. let's get to the core of Bateman because i think he is the only character worth analyzing in this movie. as the movie begins the rituals and emptiness of emotions of Bateman is for everyone to see by dint of bale's out of this world facial expressions. his amazing delivery of the dialog- 'i simply am not there.' goes to show his struggle to maintain a social life outside to hide the killer inside much like Dexter. but that's about as far as it goes with similarities between him and Dexter.Dexter is born with blood lust but Bateman is driven to blood lust by the greed and expectation of being superior in lifestyle than others of the corporate and to an extent modern city life and the pressure it brings with it. the vice presidents of pierce and pierce, including Bateman, in spite of their achievements are simply not happy. they judge and envy each other based on designer clothes and 'tasteful' accessories. Bateman just has an extreme reaction to this envy or as he puts it- disgust. the disgust is rather disagreement on certain choices rather than actually being disgusting on a morale level. his victims earlier in the film are disgusting to him like- Paul or that homeless guy. as the film progresses his victims are victims of his impulse or insanity rather than disgust.a scene which really catches me is when Bateman drags Paul's dead body in a bag. seeing him Luis asks him where he got that bag instead of asking what he was carrying in it. he was more interested in knowing the brand of the bag rather than inquiring bateman what it was that was so heavy that he had to drag in an overnight bag.this scene gives the feeling of corporate greed. the conversation in ESPACE solidifies this feeling of emotional emptiness, which is predominant throughout the film, through the sheer disbelief of bateman in what he himself was saying, evidenced by bale's brilliant empty eyes and facial expressions.Bateman is not as calm as Dexter because he was not born a serial killer. in every conversation with the detective, his nervousness and suspicious behavior gives him away. his impulse ultimately drives him to insanity. his relation with his secretary is the only relationship in this movie that is interesting.i can't help but think that he feels something for her. when he brings her to his apartment he is hesitating and not as spontaneous as he is with his other kills. after Evelyn's call he asks her to leave before he hurts her. his panic call to her is as close as bateman comes to humanity in this film. the ending is confusing yet brilliantly sublime. my interpretation is that bateman didn't kill them, just wanted to. his assistant finds his Pb where his wishes are drawn out and you may call them fantasy. he might never have the guts to kill them in real life but he thinks his kills and fantasies will help him get rid of his 'greed and disgust'. this ending goes perfectly with the film's tone. finally, the movie and bale is brilliant.the sex scenes are disturbing the only fault you can find is you do not get to connect with any other character. that's why i think if you take bale out of this film you are left with absolutely nothing. bale deserved an Oscar. many found humor in this film but i honestly didn't find any. maybe because bale consumed me with horror and disbelief through his actions and pin point acting. if you watch this movie closely you will be encapsulated by bale and have your own view of the ending. that's what so brilliant about it.",American Psycho

The performance in this movie, is absolutely outstanding! The way he portraits Bateman, the psychotic serial-killer is by far the best performance I've ever seen in a movie! The plot in this movie is excellent, and during the movie you really understand how much of a psycho Batman actually is! The music in this movie is amazing, and really sets the mood for the film!

I am also a big fan of the book and thought that the film stayed true to the book in every way(which isn't normally the case), the only differences it has from the book is that there are a few of the names that have been changed and a few parts that a mixed-up, meaning that some parts are at the beginning rather than the end where they should be. Anyway to the film, Bale is absolutely superb in his role and I could not of thought of anybody more suited to it.A very well put together piece of film as well, showing that because everybody is so into fashion, nobody really has an identity. As it shows with people getting Bateman's name wrong and vice-versa. So even though Bateman is killing people nobody can really point the finger at him, which you will all find out. If you haven't seen this movie get it, if you have watch it again.",American Psycho
934,diima,Confusing as hell,1,7 January 2014,"I did not understand the concept of the movie at all. It did not have a beginning nor an end, which many would see at a positive angel. There are many great movies without any beginnings or ends but this one was not one of them. The unique mind of Pat Bateman fills you with such wonders and awe that in some way that awe whitewashes the entire movie altogether. You get drawn into his world and I for one did not understand it which was the negative part of the movie. You were never informed of almost anything, the only reason you were there for was to observe, listen to what he had to say and that was it. A lot of scenes and plots in that movie were left in confusion or unanswered and after a while I realized they tended to keep it that way. What I did like was the acting of Christian Bale. So drawn into his character I sometimes forgot he also is the savior of Gotham. Maybe I'm at fault for comparing two completely different characters, but that is what got through my mind as I observed Bateman. Instead of making a character out of a movie Christian Bale made a movie out of Batemans character. In my opinion he raised the movie into a whole new level. A level that made me feel confused about this movie. Was the movie good or bad? One other thing leaving me a bit frustrated was the fact that the movie seemed to try being more than it was. The content weighed too much for the movie to be able to perform good and that kind of ruined the whole thing. Something THAT new like a whole new mind, thinking and world such as Batemans would've been something so good to work with if they hadn't rushed things too much. They tried to put it all into 102 minutes when we just had adapted ourselves into his way of thinking. If I had created this mind I would've at least had several movies about this or a series, because something like this, in my opinion, takes time. We didn't learn everything about the vampire, a whole new creature, with just one or two movies did we?",American Psycho
935,jdernst45,Watch the movie before reading the book!,7,16 October 2006,"American Psycho is one of my all time favorite books. That being said, the movie left me highly disappointed. One thing I've learned over the years is that if you've read a book and really enjoyed it, you will ultimately be disappointed by the movie adaptation. The book is highly disturbing and for some sick and twisted reason, highly comical.When reading the book, I got the impression that it was intended to be a dark comedy. I could have been wrong and was just laughing at things when I shouldn't have been, but the movie didn't really have a whole lot that made me laugh. The movie was just lacking in spirit. I am a big fan of Christian Bale, but his character seemed a little too robotic, much like his character in Equilibrium.The movie just didn't live up to the legacy of the book. Had I not read the book first, I probably would have enjoyed the movie more. That being said, anyone who has seen and enjoyed the movie, go read the book. It is a horrifying look at what mankind is capable of, and something that will stick out in your mind for the rest of your life",American Psycho

This might seem obvious given the title, but when watching it the first time, i was sitting there thinking, ""ok so he is going around killing people, big deal"" But on watching it for the second time it just hit me as he digs the axe into Jared Leto's back, this guy is a frigging' psycho!!Again, this might sound stupid and obvious, but as i was watching it the first time i was like, ""ok so he is going around killing people for NO REASON, big deal"" Once again, during the second time round I realised that he psychotic mind WAS his reason! And thus i came to appreciate the meaning of the film! Also, something that made me appreciate the film even more, was before watching it a third time, i came across ""American Psycho II"", i watched this...it was the worst film i have ever seen...but not in the way ""American Psycho"" was, this ACTUALLY was the worst film ever. Therefore, i decided to watch ""American Psycho"" again. My love for this film grew once more as i saw Christian Bale feeling the need to slaughter one of his best friends - just because he had the same business card as him! You see, this film is not just about senseless violence, but more about the insanity that this anal, pedantic, American psycho brings to the screen (flawlessly by Bale)Most definitely a film to see before you die!",American Psycho
937,latino_kurt,American Psycho - the title says it all,9,14 July 2005,"Christian Bale leapt into the public eye with his stunning, dead-eyed performance as Patrick Bateman, the higher-class of serial killer. I agree entirely with one of the review citations on the video case, 'Best movie monster since Hannibal Lecter.' Bateman is darkly humorous at times, but like a true psychopath, he feels only for himself and requires instant and full gratification, and the lengths he goes to in order to achieve this are truly shocking. The yuppy lifestyle of the Eighties is beautifully epitomised by Bale - one of my personal favourite actors - and captured by Mary Harron, who did a brilliant job with the film. Supporting performances by Reese Witherspoon, Samantha Mathis and Jared Leto et al ensure that Bale is not left to carry the burden alone, but when he has to he does it in style. Leo DiCaprio displaced Bale for the part before Bale won it back, and judging by his performance, he was the right man for the job. Ultimately, like the Lecter movies the critics compared it to, this is not simply a tale of gore and frenzy, but a tale of light and dark, woven together inextricably in a single insane mind. Simple tasks that Bateman performs every day remind us that he is still, to a degree, normal, and that there is part of him in all of us, for better or for worse.

950,SouthernBelleGLS,Bret Easton Ellis was not given justice!,1,26 March 2006,"I love Christian Bale just as much as any other Welsman, but the movie, ""American Psycho"" was NOT, I repeat, NOT credible to the book. It moved so quickly, and seemed really to have no point. I read the book before I saw the movie, and was really excited to see the movie. My boyfriend and I went to Movie Gallery every weekend to check to see if it was in. Finally, when it was we rented it. By the beginning of the movie, it started in like chapter 7! This might make sense in essence of time, but it made Bateman seem like a senseless killer who randomly puts on plastic coats and axes people in his apartment. It doesn't touch upon the subject of him losing his identity and falling into the pit of the eighties, just him discussing Evian with his friends, then at a club, then killing someone. I am not sure if it really is supposed to be a movie because so much of the book is internal. For example, the description of Phil Collins was its own chapter in the book, but in the movie he was describing it to the two prostitutes. This does make sense, I guess, but it is just another flaw that really did deplete from the character of Patrick Bateman. To someone who hadn't read the book, they would have just thought, ""This is a man who is really full of himself, likes sex and kills people for no reason. What an asshole!"" Essentially, that is how it could be viewed, but the aspect of his identity, esteem and human need to really be accepted was not thrown into the mix at all, and I think that's what it was missing. Also, it was not bloody enough. Haha, I'm kidding. Oh, yeah, and we watched the edited version, maybe that was the problem. No, I don't think it was.

954,geryon66,huh?,2,3 March 2001,"Okay, I'm usually a fan of pretentious films which other people find to be boring and plotless, but I have to say that this movie was in fact boring and plotless.  Not to mention pointless and valueless.  It seemed to be about an hour and forty-five minutes of gratuitous violence wrapped up at the end with an extreme copout of a twist.  The violence wasn't especially graphic really, there just happened to be a lot of it implied off screen and so forth with very little else of consequence occurring in the film.  The movie is nearly devoid of likeable characters, save perhaps Chloe Sevigny's and Willem Dafoe's characters, both of whom are as underdeveloped as all of the other characters in the film, alleged protagonist included.  I have to say that the complete nothing of a script was fairly well acted and well shot.  If these scenes could somehow be reassembled and added to in a manner which would produce a compelling story or anything at all for the viewer to identify with, perhaps it could have been an excellent film.  Alas, I find it difficult to enjoy a film which has no semblance of a plot or point and therefore have to recommend that if you never see this film, it will be too soon.  It's seemingly an attempt at giving the appearance of a smart and arty film and while visually it does have some art worth commending, it lacks any real intelligence or insight.

The novel can be excused its wafer-thin plot as it is a first person narrative of a psychopath.The film doesn't have that luxury and it really requires a better than Christian bale to play such a complex character. It seems director mary harron was unsure about how to film this.On the one hand she has censored all the gore and black comedy which was the novel's raison d'etre yet she casts bale and Willem Dafoe-actors scarcely noted for their subtlety.balein particularly overacts inexcusably- American actors like Ethan Hawke or ben Affleck would have done a much better job. In all the film is lacking in originality.The movie was edited again to remove all the violent bits and like The Avengers or the Kilmer saint flick this subsequent is all too obvious and the movie seems disjointed and unfocussed.perhaps harron was hoping a strong performance from Christian Bale would help but he spends so much time on the tics and mannerisms that he fails to drive the narrative forward and his bateman is simply irritating..more like the office pest than a ruthless serial killer.To be honest i wondered why the female characters liked him so much.He's handsome in a bland way but he lacks the charm and manipulative charisma that I'd envisaged bateman having. All in all this film is a mess.A wasted opportunity.Unlike the book there is no hint as to why bateman commits his crimes and to be honest by halfway through I didn't care.

961,valtteri.rantala,A nice adaptation of Brett Easton Ellis' controversial book,9,19 May 2000,"Having read the book on number of occasions, I was suspicious of how this book can be transformed to the silver screen without it losing it's edge.
After that, I was pleased to note that the director and screen writer have done a great job in selecting and building up the scenes yet preserving the overall storyline of the book which, in essence, was a satire of late 1980's nihilistic culture and society.As far as screenplay goes, I especially liked the little gimmick of having P. Bateman do the ""record introductions"" of the book while playing a totally another scene. Bale presents a totally believable Patrick Bateman, delivering a stunning performance. His performance sadly overcomes the performances of other actors in key roles, but this for me did not present a problem, as I viewed the film as being very lead role centric, anyway.Although compared to the book the gore factor was downplayed in the movie, it was depicted in a way that conveyed well the essence of Bateman's character yet kept the movie in a class that doesn't end up being raped by censors.All in all, I was very pleased by the adaptation, and can even recommend it to anyone not having read the book itself as a truly chilling horror comedy / satire.",American Psycho
962,imdb-345,Social commentary meets horror,10,10 August 2002,"American Psycho is one of the best films I've seen in recent years; it is always refreshing to see a film with something to say.  By the way, I've never read the book.American Psycho is not a film for the faint-hearted.  One could argue that at times the violence appears to be of the tongue-in-cheek, over the top style of Evil Dead, for instance, but I think that is to miss the point. Clearly here the intention is to provoke a reaction, and to ask the question ""why?"", not to provide convincing real-life scenarios.Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman excels: you could feel Bateman's tension reach out from the screen.  I found that near the end I was feeling more sympathy for Bateman than for anyone as he alone had shown emotional reactions to his environment.I particularly like the fact that the film felt like a complete work; the themes in it were explored.  Technically I found the film to be superb: photography, lighting and sets were stark and appropriate to the story; Bateman's choice in music was simply hilarious.Note to some other reviewers: this film is not a whodunnit!  If you've ever thought about a film you saw for more than five minutes then go and watch it: you won't be disappointed.",American Psycho
963,MitHundeSein,American Psycho must be approached strictly as satire.,6,21 May 2001,"Spoilers.First, any film that requires the viewer to read the novel it was based on is automatically a failure. Fortunately, that is not true of American Psycho. While reading the novel may help, the film successfully stands on its own. I haven't read the novel yet, and my comments will refer to the film alone.Second, the film should be regarded strictly as a satire and all the events and plot twists are in service to that purpose. If the viewer encounters elements that do not seem believable on a realistic level, then that viewer should look for an allegorical meaning instead. The advertising for American Psycho, in its attempt to draw in a wider audience, did it an injustice by making it seem to be a thriller or psychological portrait of a serial killer. The film is neither of these genres. The film is about the violent and soulless greed of the eighties, the carnage that this greed caused, and the utter failure of justice to correct or even learn from the catastrophe that followed. When we keep these themes in mind, the characters and events of the film are far more understandable.On the larger scale, the film comments upon the destruction wrought by the eighties greed, which is best exemplified by the Savings and Loan collapse. These financial failures are like the mangled bodies of psychotic killers, raped and killed with impunity. The justice system seemed utterly impotent in the face of such well-mannered and slick criminals. These corporate killers showed brazen lack of concern about getting caught; nonetheless they escaped justice. Their charmed life always magically provided someone to clean up their messes. Detective Kimball's failure to figure out the truth reflects the law's inability to impose justice upon this situation.Patrick Bateman is both an exemplar of the shallowness and obsession for surfaces of the era and a failure by its standards. Despite obsessively conforming to the mores of his social circle (""I just want to fit in""), he nonetheless fails to succeed in the continuous competition with his peers, so amusingly depicted in the scene of business card envy. His inward emptiness is displayed by the lavish praise and attention he gives to the blandest of pop music--Phil Collins is the most sublime experience Bateman is capable of. As a consequence of his ability to gain the respect of his colleagues, he also fails to distinguish himself as an individual apart from the multitude of empty suits that comprise his social circle. This lack of determinate personality explains the constant mistaking of his identity by his peers and their refusal to believe that the `lightweight' Bateman is capable of committing deeds not only terrible but decisive.The paradox of Bateman's intense desire to succeed lies in the attempt to create an authentic personality by conforming to social standards that make it impossible to distinguish oneself except by winning the endless competition over externals: the most stylish apartment, the bigger account, the best business card. Bateman fails in each of these competitions and each failure leads to a violent episode of sex and murder. He too shows complete disregard for the consequences and fails to take even the most basic precautions against discovery; he leaves trails of blood in the lobby of his building, occupies the apartment of the victim for whose disappearance he is being investigated, runs naked through the halls of an apartment house chasing a screaming prostitute while brandishing a chainsaw, and so on. As the film near its conclusion, it seems that Bateman can't possibly escape, but like his brothers in the financial massacre, everything, even his repeated confession, is magically overlooked, ignored, and disbelieved.In the final scene, Bateman and his colleagues sit in a yuppie bar looking up at the television screen, admiring Ronald Reagan for his inner ruthlessness. This scene recalls the conclusion of 1984, in which a defeated Winston Smith sits sipping Victory gin in the Victory café, crying tears of love for the image of Big Brother on the monitor and confessing to crimes he did not commit. Smith's inner self has been exterminated and all that remains is a shell able to think only what it has been conditioned to think. In the same vein, Bateman's desperate attempt to become a person has also been crushed, but not by the same means. The charmed life that saves him from the law is also his curse. Bateman comes to the realization that we cannot gain wisdom and self-knowledge from our crimes unless they are recognized as crimes and are punished accordingly. He remains the empty suit.",American Psycho
964,kristy-15,It was an excellent film.,10,15 July 2000,"Something about the main character drew me to him.  I loved the inner-monologue narration and I believe that was key for the audience to really get a peak at the thought process of the main character.  Although the topic is quite dark, this is definitely my favorite movie of the year.",American Psycho
965,Andreas-101,disappointing only because it shows flashes of brilliance...,7,23 September 2000,"Spoiler alertOne scene describes the basic problem - Bateman moving nervously, secretively and giddily through his apartment, gathering the essential tools (an axe, a raincoat) while espousing to a co-worker/soon to be victim, the merits of Huey Lewis and the News in a staccato cadence, and then... - an implied murder. No shots of the victim getting axed, just shots of an enraged Bateman swinging an axe and getting blood spurted up onto his face.
If your going to make a movie based on Bret Easton Ellis' notorious novel, you better have the guts to go all the way. You can't choose one of the more disturbing books on the shelf, and then fail to utilize the very parts of the book that make it disturbing.And that's really the crux of the matter. The direction is quite excellent in parts, and my kudos to the director for knowing how to frame a shot really, really well. Christian Bale's performance is fantastic. He is 100% believable as a psychopath. (actually I'm convinced that anybody who owns more than one Whitney Houston album is more than slightly disturbed) The look and feel of the film are perfect. What's missing is the heavy body blows that the story requires. The excruciating gore, the torture, the ON SCREEN violence, in the book, all of these things are intended to at first juxtapose against and then gradually blend into his Yuppie Scum lifestyle. (He's supposedly clean cut, but he's actually a serial killer. He's supposedly a perfect catch, but he's frighteningly misogenistic, just like the culture and the era) To ""get"" the disturbed point, that all these 80's wall-street shop-till-you-drop, in-crowd, reservation having, business card dropping, homophobic, sexist, racist pigs are indistinguishable from the worst kind of monsters and practice on a societal level what the monsters practice on a personal level... to ""get"" the point you need the most vicious contrast possible. That's why ellis wrote it in the first place. The end doesn't make any sort of sense unless the violence and gore is too horrible to imagine. Then you can see that possibly, just possibly this was all some sort of twisted fantasy... in the movie it just looks like he got away with the whole thing.
Decent movie 7 out of 10, worth watching for Bale's superb performance and the director's competent work, burdened most likely by the industry and censors who wouldn't know an allegory if it walked up and killed them with a chainsaw.",American Psycho

Nothing in the whole story bears any semblance to reality. I doubt that any research whatsoever was done into what goes on in the mind of a psychopathic killer - this one had literally nothing in common with any of the real-life ones mentioned in the movie. This film does a real disservice to the subject, as well as to what little decency is left in both cinema and society.",American Psycho
969,ruppoman,"Either you loathe it, or you adore it",9,9 January 2001,"A review about American Psycho is certainly a very difficult matter. I have to admit, I like this movie. Of course it's not of the kind you can watch in the evining for a  relaxing pleasure, you should reflect on it. To be precise, you are even forced to think about it after watching. Patrick Batmans nightly scouring, his unleashed cruelty and his increasing hideous crimes become a voyage in its mad psyche, a switchback into a poor man's mind .I honestly can understand anyone detesting American Psycho, but I can't concur. Calling it a Movie about cruelty and mutilation would be too superficial. The more you think about it, the more you understand it. It's not a movie which I would suggest my mother to go in, but if you are interested in good motion pictures, if you really are engaged in movie art, you just have to know American Psycho :-)",American Psycho

Throughout the entire movie his obsessions with sex, material items, and his quirky almost OCD personality traits portray a man that is in every sense of the word, crazy. The only way this movie should be under a 8 rating is if it is perceived as a slasher film. Its not entirely about Bateman killing people, but mostly about how hes out of his f*cking mind.Bateman as a character is so complex that it makes every bit of this movie interesting and almost funny. I have never seen a psycho portrayed in any movie so well. There's crazy people in movies so often, its rare that you see one that makes you say ""sh** this guy is really f8cking crazy"".

If you saw the movie, and didn't like it, I have something to tell you. Ok, maybe you do not believe me, but I was practically the only person in the theater who was laughing. Try it a second time, I think people couldn't understand that the movie was a comedy. I hope you can change your opinion, like I changed mine when I saw a movie called ""After Hours"", only in the second time I saw it I could understand that the movie was very funny.

973,shimron-72272,My all-time favorite movie.,10,28 October 2019,"I haven't read the book, and opinion is divided on whether it's better than the movie or not, but personally I don't want to read the book because I don't want anything different. The book is ambiguous as to whether Patrick Bateman actually carries out his crimes (i.e. he's a psycho) or not (i.e. he hallucinated or dreamed them), leaning towards the former, but the movie is definitely on the side of the paranoid schizophrenia theory. All the crimes take place at night and most of them feature elements that are utterly improbable, such as managing to hit a running person in the back with a chainsaw by dropping it several floors down a spiral staircase, managing to drag a body-bag trailing blood through a staffed foyer and out onto the street without anyone noticing, and managing to wipe out two armed patrol units and their cars (blowing them up) using a pistol loaded with a single magazine while not even taking a graze.
Therefore, I have always approached this movie as a satire rather than a horror, with the protagonist being one to pity rather than to despise. As such, I believe it is far more rewarding and entertaining than it would be otherwise.
Opinion will always be divided on this movie, as it still leaves some ambiguity in terms of where reality stops and Bateman's imagination begins.
Whatever the case, this is a movie that everyone should see at least once, if only to decide for one's self, but more so because it is visually stunning, with faultless and compelling direction, perspicacious script and realistic characterization.",American Psycho

976,r-57117,American Psycho Review,8,24 January 2020,"The film American Psycho, which was directed by Mary Harron, focuses on the life of the character of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). Bateman is a wealthy vice president of an investment bank on Wall Street, who is also an unknown serial killer to others. He and the people in his wealthy inner circle mainly focus on the materialistic things in life, such as exclusive dinner reservations, expensive clothing, and the status of their business cards. Patrick Bateman has urges to murder innocent people for little to no reason, which leads to him going on a killing spree throughout New York city. He confesses these murders to his lawyer, Harold Carnes, but the confession is not taken seriously and his lawyer acts like nothing happened.
Christian Bale does a great job of fulfilling the role of Patrick Bateman, expressing a wide range of multiple different personalities and ultimately acting as a ""psycho"". The way the film was shot and composed presents the story and characters in an anticipating way, wanting to know what will happen next. Most of the different camera shots made sense for each scene, including the main focus of the subject(s). The transitions between sequences are smooth and often include music that would either counter or compliment the theme of the upcoming scenes. Dark and slow paced scenes were used to create suspense and give the viewer a feeling of fear based on the vengeful acts of Patrick Bateman. The dialogue between most of the characters is shallow and concise, but gives enough detail to continue the story. The way that the script was written helps support the different sides and personalities Bateman has, such as in one scene, he was talking to his colleagues and seemed to be acting normal, but after they were showing their business cards he had a short temper and walked out. The actors and script also give a sense of the other characters and their personalities. The other main actors, such as the characters in Bateman's inner circle, give us the sense of actually listening to a conversation between wealthy New York businessmen. Including the actors and script, the composition of the scenes are very detailed and set with a specific vision to follow the plot. In comparison, the film Scream directed by Wes Craven, gives the feeling of horror and fear as well as American Psycho, although it is easier to realize it is fiction. The way that American Psycho gives more of a realism factor is based on the plot of a wealthy businessman living in New York City, it is not expected for someone matching this description to be a serial killer.
Overall, the film American Psycho is a movie that I would watch again at some point. The plot is interesting and maintains focus throughout, with senses of humor, fear and anticipation. The composition of the visuals is also an important and impressive part of this film, maintaining interest and entertainment during the whole duration of the film. The direction of Mary Harron was very thought out and brings the story and plot of the film to life.",American Psycho
977,krawenznik,Doesn't have to be confusing,9,20 August 2021,"I don't spoil anything specifically, but just NOTE before reading that I will be comparing the movie and the book, so some differences regarding what the book has that the movie doesn't may come up.I will give an opinion as a person who has read the book and as a person who hasn't.Person who HAS read the book:
The movie is WAY less confusing if you read the book. You just get more things, more jokes or notice little (but important) details, which are crucial to the character. It is also fair to say that this is a VERY good adaptation of the book. The director and writers didn't made stuff up. They may have mix it up a little but that may be because the book is long and a lot of things happen. (If they were to keep everything from the book exactly as it is, it wold be a job only for Kubrick maybe, or Lynch - to put it in other words: it would be a LONG movie. But it makes sense nevertheless, well... as much sense as the book made).Patrick (Christian Bale) pays close attention to details and the book contains A LOT of descriptions of clothes, people, products etc... So, still beeing a good adaptation, the movie just doesn't have some parts, especially the very gory ones and the Armani, cotton, Evian rumble. The parts that may be considered the parts that make the book THE book, but the book and the movie can exist separately. Movies just need to reach a bigger audience I suppose, books, like this one, can be scandalous. Book and movie also came out in different times. Different circumstances. Just a lot came into the equation I guess.I personally enjoyed the book. It was shocking, which made me have high, yet unrealistic, expectations of the movie, but as I was reading I understood w h y the movie wont have all the bloody and plainly wrong moments - not a lot of people would bare watching it. I know I wouldn't. The book just gives MORE. I understood more because the book is from the point of view of Patrick Bateman, so the reader has a deeper insight into his thoughts. Watching the movie, the main character especially but also the way he sees the world, seemed a little shallow. I imagined his thoughts (from the book) that he would think while doing something, but only because his thoughts were very specific, he was specific and he had a lot of thoughts. I felt some holes in the movie, but that's okey, it was a good watch anyway. It didn't leave me mortified like the book did, but it didn't have to. The movie IT SELF is good. If the book didn't exist, it would still be a good movie. But because the book does exist, I'm glad I read it before watching the movie.Person who HASN'T read the book:
I watched the movie with my friend who hasn't read the book and she enjoyed it nevertheless. She asked me at some points what just happen, or who is this person, because the film happens fast. The topic is not typical, the plot is unique, the situations are specific - which makes it a great movie. I also tried to imagine how I would see the movie if I didn't know all the things that Patrick Bateman was thinking, and as the person who read the book said: a little confusing. BUT still enjoyable. The movie is not for everyone, movie vibe wise, its not really a horror or a thriller, its slow, it's interesting, Christian Bale is amazing, it can be funny, but I prefer how i look at the movie having the book in mind. I just like understanding the original meaning of the characters and plot, etc. But that's me, and still after reading the book I don't understand everything, BECAUSE THE BOOK IT SELF IS A LITTLE CONFUSING.In conclusion:
If you read the book - great, congratulations for being able to finish it, you will be either disappointed because the movie is not gory, its not shocking, but you will understand it on a different, deeper level by yourself, or you will be happily surprised, because the movie is just enjoyable, its just a good-weird-BUT THATS THE POINT-it not made to be easily understood, movie :)
If you haven't read the book - also great, if your into weird, not so straight forward-don't know what's happing-movies - this is a movie for you :)",American Psycho

Easton Ellis did a masterful piece at painting descriptions and being as graphic as possible. While it would have been impossible to include every element of the 300+ page book, the movie fell short of my expectations. Bale did a fantastic job as Bateman, but outside of that, I couldn't really point out any other top notch performances. With the bad acting and the forced details, it just seemed like a terrible attempt to capture Easton Ellis' masterpiece.My favorite scene of the movie was the business card scene, which captured the jealous Bateman had perfectly, but again, outside of that there was nothing entirely special. The prostitute murder scene was stupid, the laundry scene was decent, the dinners were boring and contrived. This movie really could have been something special if they put ANY effort into it, but sadly, they did not.For that, I must give it 5 stars.

Oh my God, it even has Christian Bale's finest performance.American Psycho is a captivating study of a madman who simultaneously obsesses and criticizes the shallow culture he's a part of and attempts to hide his chaotic personal life through excessive vanity and beautification. Harron's direction is very impressive as she manages to take the story through the narrow route that blurs the line between fiction and reality with great finesse. American Psycho is a fascinating vignette of lunacy and obsession as it intriguingly blends its elements of horror and dark comedy into an exquisitely paced, masterfully directed and magnificently written story that delves into the mind and psyche of its incredibly deranged individual with plenty of success, and remains one of the finest achievements of its genre(s) and of the greatest movies of the 2000s.",American Psycho

When he tries to confess, no one listens because it just doesn't make sense for a wall street guy to commit murder. Business card scene was the best. Typos in the cards and the shared vice president titles really takes the cake. Bateman and others are just as clueless as the next guy, but they try so hard to keep up a façade to fit in with others.

It's hard to make a movie work when none of the characters has any more depth than a shedded snakeskin and you just can't care if they live or die. Yea, I know the characters are supposed to be shallow (they are, after all, 80s stockbrokers - Hollywood's ultimate soulless weasel stereotype), but they lack even that much depth. They're wet-paper thin. It's almost possible to generate some sympathy for the prostitute or the secretary - almost. In the end you just can't care. Live? Die? Whatever - just get to the bloody point already.In the end, you'll feel exactly what the main character feels -- nothing.",American Psycho

You'll laugh your head off at the way Patrick Bateman reacts toward everything. He is, I believe, so obsessive compulsive that it drives him to insanity. The end will have you guessing the major question - did he really do it? It's a flawless ending and I'll leave it up to the viewer to decide whether or not he committed such acts of inhumanity or if it was all just one hoax conjured in the mind of Patrick Bateman.

The title describes the atmosphere of the movie. Mainly focused in a downtown Manhattan setting with business executive attire back in the late 80s. The protagonist snaps and starts killing people.

One of which he shoves an ax into someones (not telling who) face. I love how before he kills someone he talks about music. There are some sex scenes for those who don't like that kind of stuff so look out. They are very graphic just like this movie is, but it is amazing,an enjoyable,well written and well acted film.

It's very rare to see a movie that makes me want to read the book, it usually works the other way, but I had to buy the novel, and now Ellis is one of my favorite authors. It's definitely a ""must buy,"" don't even waste your money renting it, BUY IT! Then buy the book!The film doesn't have nearly as much content as the book, but none the less, is a personal favorite. It captures the superficial, materialistic aura of the 80's and exploits it in a beautiful way. Christian Bale captures the character ""Patrick Bateman"" in a way that is indescribable. I've always enjoyed his films, but now I'm a fan of Bale's work.Like I said before, I watched the movie before I read the book. After words, I watched the movie again and was so disappointed about the amount of material that was cut out in order to make the movie short and easy to follow for movie-goers, but that's expected.

1009,MatthewHamiltonct,"Good effort for those interested in retrospectives on the ""me"" decade",8,22 May 2007,"I went into seeing this film having already read the book; and was interested to see how the film adaptation would match up. I was pleasantly surprised, the acting was way above average and the director did a good job of making the viewer believe they were actually viewing the 1980s all over again. Christian Bale as I have read many other users comment previously, is magnificent in the role of the film's main character, as he has been in several films since, seems to play the nut-case/tormented genius rather well.Where American Psycho does, perhaps, fall away somewhat is in maintaining the audiences attention and enthusiasm past half-way through the film. There seems to be a slight lack of rhythm to the shock, shock, shock, followed by more meaningful plot evolution. I found myself losing interest to a certain degree as the plot moved on; whereas in the book I was only getting more interested as time went on. Having said this I believe this is an under-appreciated effort, and is well worth a viewing.8/10",American Psycho

1011,ctcrmcou,It's all fantasy,8,28 March 2008,"Finally saw the movie - it was one of five free blu-rays in a rebate with Sony Playstation.Many comments wondered if it was real or not.There are several giveaways that the murders were fantasies. Many times Bateman says things that are evil and violent to someone, but are heard by the recipient of the comments as something else.The outright murders with no witnesses, blowing up the cops vehicles for an easy escape, dragging bodies and blood through lobbies, the cleaned up apartment with no dead bodies in sight, no investigators or police crime scene tape where there should have been, .... it goes on and on. Don't forget the final scene with his lawyer. The fantasies were manifested only in the notebook found in his desk by his secretary. I'm happy she was ""spared"".I found the lack of pursuit by Willem Dafoe (the detective) to be a letdown. The initial questioning of Bateman was definitely right out of the original Psycho, and I found this confrontation as the start of a great ""gonna getcha"" in the end. But it never happened.The only question is, why was a detective asking Bateman questions in the first place, or, was the idea of a missing colleague the spark for a fantasy, just shown after the fact.I loved the business card one-upsmanship. It shows how shallow rich vice presidents (about a dozen were there?) are, and what losers they really are in life as people. Misery loves company, I guess. Reminded me a lot of the yuppies in Trading Places. Bored and prissy. Although they think they are living the ""good life"", but contribute nothing in the end.It was a fun movie, probably sparks our fantasies about what we'd like to do with the scum of this earth - but that's why it's only a movie.",American Psycho

He plays Patrick Bateman very tongue in cheek and this is somewhat entertaining at times. Reese Witherspoon has a very small role as his bimbo girlfriend, and her acting talents are wasted. The cat-and-mouse plot line between our ""Psycho"" and cop Defoe is not fleshed out and fizzles. In the end, its as if the filmmakers and actors got tired of this effort and just said we're done.

The setting is perfect, just as in the book by Bret Ellis Easton, the me generation of the 1980's. All the excesses (money, drugs, women, violence) are prevalent through out the film.

1016,dukesmellingtn,would also like to clear things up,10,31 March 2008,"The ending of the movie is really left open to interpretation, but I do believe there is a specific interpretation that the film maker wanted the audience to receive. I do believe that Patrick Bateman was imagining all of his murders. The first clue is when he drags Paul Allen's body out of his apartment building, blood trails behind- BUT, when it goes to the next screen shot there is no trail of blood. Also, have you ever noticed that his three friends can never find dinner reservations? I think it's because they don't actually exist. I think a lot of the scenarios he creates are in his head, but his whole world (and the people in it ex: Jane or his fiancé) isn't imaginative. Also, Paul Allen and Patrick's lawyer confront him about Patrick Bateman being a ""loser."" When Paul Allen does it you don't think anything of it because he is a superior to Bateman, but when the lawyer does it, it's questionable. The detective is obviously fake because he has so much in common with Bateman that it is unreal; also, the detective is never particularly suspicious of Bateman despite his suspicious actions. If you caught the first scene with the detective, he whips out a CD that Bateman obviously would have liked and referred to the music just as Bateman would. Bateman says he doesn't listen to music because he is freaked out by the similarities.",American Psycho

He was sure no one things the way he things and is only sure they are hinting more of affectation. He knew there is no one who finds joy in himself and are only posing arguments then of reading their mind. In every way he is superior to everybody he sees. But the day he finds out that someone else was promoted to the vice-president to him, he was battered, perplexed. As he finds no reasons for this, he decides to kill those in line for the post and he does these killings not in pure conscience but the beastliness in him because his conscience will never finds the answer to the question why wasn't he promoted? As fail to kill those men for various reasons he only finds joy or mitigate his pain only by killing mean people whose lose of life will not be probed by police to a greater extent. Every time he fells perverse he tortures and kills prostitutes so on.. I heard somewhere there might also be another perception that he isn't killing people by only perceiving them and is only believing that he did them. This can't be fully true there may be some perceptions(like the cat,beggar etc..) but considering what he did with prostitutes there isn't much weight to this argument.",American Psycho

1019,fabiendanger,Better than excellent,10,24 August 2007,"I have read many comments and I have to say that many (here) just analyze this masterpiece from a reductive point of view : the first degree. I do believe you cannot fully appreciate ""American psycho"" if you only see a man in Bateman. Indeed, in this story, every character represents a symbol.One, in a previous comment, has said that Patrick represents the American Dream. This is interesting. To my point of view, he represents the most ugly face of America. Not the one who helps the poor, not the one who respects women, not the one who will be able able to love somebody else than himself. He is America when there is no human dimension anymore.Bateman then can kill this poor guy in the street, some whores. As well, he cannot love his girlfriend. On the contrary, he will consider himself as a kind of God and will respect nobody else. Then this scene at the restaurant when he is among friends and talk about social progress is so funny.Watch the movie and ask yourself : ""What character is an exception to Bateman's insanity?"" ""Which person is offered to him but not killed?"" Then you will see that this person is the secretary. The America of the 80's was very racist (the Reagan's years), don't we forget it. This young wasp-typed lady is the only one to escape safely to Patrick's madness.It is not by simple chance that the movie finishes with Ronald Reagan on TV and Patrick's partners commenting his speech. All is here. Nothing has happened even if Bateman's nightmare was real. The craziness of the 80's (the money decade) is illustrated by Bateman. This is some kind of fable and allegory. This is how I understand it. ""There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this. This confession has meant nothing..."" are the last words and a the author denies, in a last ironic eruption, the quality of his superb work.Mary Harron has done a great jobChristian Bale is amazingBret Easton Ellis is a genius.

1020,ccavallimurray,Poor,1,2 October 2009,"A Movie devoid of any type of hope regarding society whatsoever. American Psycho attempts to create an relationship devoid of a greater morale guidance to try and demonstrate the faults of man, yet in doing so simply creates a petty, heavy handed film, which basks in unnecessary violence and cruelty. Truly I feel for the film, for whose ideals are lost in a mix of self-righteous anger, and seemingly naive hope. For me, I find this film to be another 'drop in the bucket' when talking about the mass variety of terrible films one can possibly find lurking in the movie stores shelves. As for the ability for Christian Bale to act, I still have no doubt, he is as ever capable and true an actor as always. I find it saddening though, that his character back-story and modus operandi was written in a chisel-tip expo marker, when a fine point pen would have been more than sufficient.

1021,cartermichael90,Excellent film but also frightening to know these people exist.,10,26 May 2010,"The film title is self explanatory. It's about an American, that is a psycho. Christian Bale's character is depicted brilliantly in this film and to think that people like this exist in real life is a somewhat frightening thought. American Psycho puts forward the idea of of self perfection to the extreme. Physically and just to name one example, in his work when he is trying to withhold his inner rage from not having the best 'business card' out of his colleagues. There are many films where there is a person who goes from being 'normal' human being to a psycho and vice versa. But here, Bale's character is psychotic from the beginning until the end with no explanation as to why. Towards the end he tries to let his lawyer know he's killed people, but no one will listen to him and this is the closest he gets to having any form of logical knowledge. This film is excellent and is very unique as it isn't always the protagonist narrating his own film however in this interpretation he does and it makes it all the most interesting and intriguing.

So, I ignored the fuss. The movie version is very interesting, but as dull as the book. the only thing I really liked was Bateman's pop music critique! I remember actually owning many of the same CDs as this guy, which is very scary in a way. The song 'hip to be Square' IS very catchy...until the axe is slammed down on Paul's head. I've never heard that song the same way. Anyway, the book was gruesome and hard to read ( I am a writer myself, I don't think i have ever read anything so brutal). I came to the conclusion that Bateman was probably imagining or fantasizing about his crimes, probably jotting them down in a diary...all for fun! I do recall Bret Easton Ellis admitting that the character was fantasizing. 'American Psycho' is a good movie, but you'll never listen to Phil Collins or Huey Lewis in the same way again.",American Psycho
1023,geoff-hollingsworth,In a word...,9,28 October 2010,"Excellent. The way Bale portrays Patrick Bateman both engages the character with the audience and keeps us guessing his true nature. The constant changes in personality given a further presence of darkness and intrigue, which is only heightened by the ending. The artistic feel of the film, which I feel if symbolised straight after Bateman kills someone then is seen drawing the details of their death as an infant gave greater depth to both him as a character and the story, and made it all that much more complex.However, there are some minor details which personally, took away from the realness the movie delivered. Such as Bateman standing on the stairway, simply watching his victim run away then just 'dropping' the chainsaw which, lucking for him, hit her.

1025,tomas_martins12,A bloody drama,8,27 October 2011,"The film uses dark humor to satirize the '80s. A soulless and greedy society where everybody is focused only on themselves and in how successful they are. It revolves around Patrick Bateman, a 27 year old businessman who goes on a killing spree.Bateman is a wealthy Wall Street broker, he has a luxurious apartment, an expensive suit and a limo. But at night he turns into a monster and he kills people with little to no sympathy to them.Every men in this movie is obsessed about his image and Bateman is no exception, he explains us in detail how he works out,what shampoos and body lotions he applies and how he goes to the solarium. He is not only concerned about his physical appearance though, he constantly argues with his co-workers about who has the best business card by explaining in detail what type of letter the card uses and what kind of paper it is. Though, we can verify that all cards look the exact same. They compete to see who gets the dinner reservation on the best restaurant or who has the best client. This serves to show how hollow was the stereotype of the American man back in the '80s.Throughout the movie I noticed that all men look alike, they are all handsome, well educated, intelligent, wealthy, well dressed and they all share the same tastes. Such characters can easily pass by someone else and that is what happens. Bateman is called several names during the movie and he also uses one of those mix ups to commit a murder. This is another example of the stereotype, these self centered people couldn't see around them because they lived for themselves only and thus not caring about anything else.I specifically loved Christian Bale's acting while he was murdering his victims. He added a little fun to the movie by introducing humor to the character and that was a plus for me, Bale was really the perfect match for the role. From dancing at the sound of Hip to be Squared by Huey Lewis And The News to chasing a hooker through a corridor with a chainsaw in his hands and a killer look in his eyes. This also helps us understand how deranged his mind really was.The end is rather unpredictable and we get the feeling this lunatic murderer is the only one that actually feels anything towards anyone other then envy, a feeling of remorse. It gets you feeling like you wanted it not to end there and continued to see how it would all unfold after the events that took place in the end, but I guess they just wanted us to fill in the blanks. That ending provoked a confusion and left me to decide which story I wanted to believe in. What about you, what are you going to believe in? You probably won't get the meaning of it all at first and that is why I recommend you watch it as many times as it takes because this is an amazing work of art.",American Psycho

The snatches of text that I read were enough to repulse me to the umpteenth degree.American Psycho, directed by Mary Harron, and starring notable actor Christian Bale, is nothing less than fascinating and intriguing. This is why I would be amiss if I gave it anything less than an 8.I want to begin with stating the cons of this film.I am sadly disappointed by the disappointing cinematography. The actual look of the footage seems poor.A very big disappointment for me, and I don't want you to think of me as a terribly evil person, but I found there was TOO little killing the film. This film is titled American Psycho, but I think the way Mary Harron and Gueniverre Turner handled the material, it should have been called American Metrosexual/Narcissist.You might be wondering by now, what did I like about the 2000 film adaptation.I loved Christian Bale's performance. At first, I believed it was fake. I thought he was doing a terrible acting job.Then I reviewed the film again. It seemed that he was doing a parody of a fully narcissistic person.Roger Ebert and I enjoyed how Christian Bale acted in this film with no reservations whatsoever. Instead, he delved deep into psychosis and vanity without any regards (and in the acting world, that's a brilliant thing.) Kudos to Christian Bale.I think what makes this film enigmatic is that it is a stunning, satirical portrait of narcissism, vanity, conspicuous consumption, and immorality.What makes the film better is in the end, discovering that Patrick Bateman might not have actually murdered anyone, but rather imagined it all in his sick head.",American Psycho

It's almost as though the writer is mocking the corporate world with the character Pat Bateman. Some of the lines for this character were quite obviously a stab at corporate conformity, (eg. ""Because I want to fit in!"") but my boyfriend didn't seem to grasp the concept as well as I had and was left felling as though the writing was sloppy, and the movie just all around confusing. Maybe it was. But Christian Bales performance really brings the script to life. Non-stop laughs all the way through, that is if you pick up the sick humor right from the beginning. There's also some very hard hitting scenes with a character called ""Christie"", which manage to show us just how inhuman Bateman really is by how she acts and behaves around him and later on, his friend. Lovely movie, but please watch it with an open mind and *Look* for those cocky hidden messages in between what ""seems"" to be meaningless sex scenes.",American Psycho
1033,cazziuz,A good film version of one of the most brilliant books ever.,7,28 January 2005,"Patrick Bateman is young, good-looking, rich and successful. He lives in New York and works on Wall Street during the yuppie era. So on the surface everything might appear to be perfect.But what becomes ever more clear while watching this movie is, that underneath the perfect surface lies a cold-blooded killer with no conception of humanity, a serial killer who, by his respected position in society, gets away with almost anything unnoticed. In his world of luxurious apartments, fashionable restaurants and expensive clothing nothing matters more than appearance and admiration from others; the ""I"" is in focus and nobody cares about others.For all those who like the movie I recommend the book (with the same title),...it is probably the best one I ever read. I even wrote a thesis on it when I attended University.",American Psycho
1034,beeniesigel,Great Movie,10,15 April 2004,"I gave this movie a perfect 10 because the acting and casting were brilliant. The movie is based on the famous novel by Brett Easton Ellis. Although the movie doesnt leave you with the concrete fact that Bateman killed everyone I still feel that the scenes they selected from the movie were chosen well. I have heard of an unrater version but i do not know the whole story behind this. The movie is a good satire on the brutual and materialistic businessman(and American, in general) of the 1980's. He killed someone over where they can get a reservation and their business card! All in all, a good movie, I suggest reading the novel to get the full understanding of Patrick Bateman and his level of insanity.",American Psycho
1035,jpower96,A tale of fragile masculinity,8,14 June 2018,"American Psycho is the story of a psychotic investment banker - Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). He has a nice apartment, a beautiful fiancée and a nice job. However he also has a darker side. When he isn't out partying with his friends, he is out murdering prostitutes, homeless and anyone else who annoys him.While the movie certainly diverts from the book (written by Bret Easton Ellis). I'd say it diverts for the better. The book may be darker and use a lot more disturbing imagery to get its satire across, the movie instead uses a lighter tone. It still manages to deliver that biting satire about yuppie culture in the eighties.This is a movie that shines on re-watchings. The subtle details that the actors and actresses display is phenomenal along with the small things that pull it all together. The movie displays fragile masculinity in its purest form with vain and cruel men in focus. It shows how cruel this yuppie world can be, and at times you almost sympathise with Bateman on his quest to be noticed and stand out. The movies use of the song ""Hip to be Square"" is quite apt.The ending may feel a bit lackluster to some but the unsatisfyingness (best word to describe it) fits with the narrative.It may not be perfect. But considering that I've written a full length essay on this movies subject, and it still holds up - I'd say it's a great satire.",American Psycho
1036,evanbuckley66,"A review, I done for the site Don't Touch The Watch!",7,19 May 2012,"Published in 1991 by Vintage Books, the novel 'American Psycho' is told in the first person perspective of supposed serial killer, and Wall Street yuppie 'Patrick Bateman'. The book depicts in savage detail numerous and grotesque acts of violence towards women, mixed with a pornographic level of sexual content, that led to a great deal of controversy and outrage on its release.Set among the wealthy elite of Manhattan at the tail end of the 1980's, 'American Psycho' spans about three years in the life of privileged investment banker 'Patrick Bateman'. The book documents his everyday activities, told from his detached, self-obsessed perspective. There are frequent accounts of sex acts with prostitutes that 'Bateman solicits'; these (""hardbodies"") as he puts it are subjected to the worst descriptions of torture, rape, mutilation, cannibalism, and necrophilia. Originally optioned in 1991 just after its release, hoping to cash in on the wave of controversy generated by the book, the idea of an 'American Psycho' movie was shopped around the major studios. A number of scripts were drawn up, some scripted by Ellis himself, but treated the movie as a joke, Ellis even ended his script with 'Bateman' breaking into song, joined by the whole of New York.Instead the studio settled on Mary Harron, who had achieved a level of success with her 1996 film 'I shot Andy Warhol' (a period piece set in the sixties), Harron was given the task of creating 1980s Wall Street; at the peak of its 'greed is good' mentality. Initially, she considered a number of actors for the role of Bateman, including Billy Crudup, Ben Chaplin, Jonny Lee Miller, and Jared Leto. Eventually, Harron offered the part to Christian Bale, a little known, at the time British actor.Having accepted the role, Bale was met with contempt from producers, who tried to talk Harron into casting Edward Norton instead. Refusing, Harron stuck to her decision, insisting she would only make the movie if Bale was her lead. The studio finally relented, but as compensation they insisted the supporting cast be rounded out with big name actors. Agreeing, Harron hired William Defoe to play Kimball and Reese Witherspoon to play Evelyn.With knives pointed squarely at the 'yuppie' juggler, Harron and her writing partner Guinevere Turner, set about to turn Ellis's episodic un- filmable novel into a viable movie. That scathingly dissects the wretched yuppie consumer driven lifestyle, under the movies sharp script. Along with a hypnotically unhinged performance by Bale, the movie turns what could have been a sadistic run of the mill serial killer movie, into something darkly comic and unique.What little plot exists in the movie is loosely strung together by the murder of Paul Allen and the investigation into his disappearance. 'American Psycho' deliberately feels incoherent and detached as people fail to recognise each other, and often mistake one person for another, as they have becomes so interchangeable. Just as 'Bateman'spends all day in his office but never works, and visits 'ATMS' to with draw cash to an already over filled wallet. These people and their lives may look glamorous and filled with purpose, but scratch the surface and you'l find there's nothing there.Speaking recently in an interview, Harron spoke of how she saw 'Bateman' as an alien life form, trying to copy our mannerisms, to ""fit in"", as he puts it. He acts as human as he can, but he's so twisted by greed and status that he's stopped being one of us, more of an entity, collected from the cesspool of all that was rotten in the greed is good era.Bale inhabits 'Bateman', in a way no other actor possibly could. His skin an orange glow, his body a rippling series of muscles, covered by exquisitely designed suits. He so inhabits the character, that when you see him on screen you just see 'Bateman', never a performance. Having watched an appearance by Tom Cruise on the David Letterman show, Bale modeled his character on what he calls ""this very intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes"" masked by an appropriately phony smile.During the shooting of the film, Bale never dropped character even speaking in an American accent off set at all times. It was only at the wrap party, that he finally spoke in his own British accent, to the surprise of the crew members who thought he was speaking that way as a joke. It's that level of commitment that makes Bale the perfect casting choice, told at the time it would be career suicide to play the consumer monster; it instead had the opposite effect, leading to another American psycho, 'The Batman'.Filled with endlessly quotable dialogue and classic scenes, like Bateman's moonwalk in the infamous 'hey Paul' scene. The movie has taken on another life since being released, even surpassing the notorious book that it was based on. E.B From http://donttouchthewatch.blogspot.com/",American Psycho

You know, they guy doesn't realize what he's doing because he's someone else while he's killing...blah blah. The only reason I even watched this movie was because it had such a high rating and when I watched it I was like, dude, are you serious? I bet the only reason this got high reviews was because a bunch of old women liked to see the man naked. Psh. And the ending was another one of those moments where I was like, what? It's hard to tell whether he actually killed all those people or not. If he did, then the fact that he managed to get away with all those murders (including a few cops and their cars) then it's absurd to end it with him getting away with it. If he didn't and it was all just suppose to be a psychological thing then it was still a bad ending because the message or intent of the whole movie, at least for me, is unclear. Overall, glad I didn't pay for it.",American Psycho
1038,Ashley_Sumpter,Perfect portrait of a psychopath,8,28 June 2011,"I just saw this movie for the first, and i must say (with a degree in criminal psychology and knowing a lot of information on this subject), that this is a perfect example of a psychopath! Unfortunately i haven't read the book yet, however, it's incredible how well developed the character is.The lack of empathy is obvious and pointed out throughout the movie, and the fact that he ALWAYS has his ego as the first priority, for example, when he didn't kill both Jean and Luis because they complemented him, saying that he was fit, or attractive. The only thing that was truly important to him was himself and how he was presented.The despise that was given to anyone else could also be noted because of the way he keeps talking about music curiosities while he's killing someone. It's very interesting to see how he interprets the songs, mostly when he's talking about whitney houston's greatest love of all.Cristian Bale's performance is truly amazing, I've already seen his other works, but this one is truly remarkable! he makes the whole movie, and really makes the character believable!The last scene is really something, and the constant battle between himself is very interesting to watch, as he feels nothing, however he's very afraid to lose his control.overall i think that's an amazing movie, and people who like to think and try to understand this kind of mental disturbance will really enjoy seeing it.",American Psycho
1039,zomboy23-1,"Very different from the book, but just as great",9,12 July 2004,"When I first saw American Psycho, I didn't like it. It wasn't because it was poorly made or anything, it was just wildly different from what I was expecting. A couple years after seeing it, I gave it a second chance and thought it was a near masterpiece. While the book was great in pushing the limits and seeing how far it could go in the extremities of violence, this was more toned down and focused on the psychological aspect rather than the violent aspects.This film does great in balancing the disturbing imagery and attitude with the black humor of the 80's yuppie scene.WARNING: THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SPOILERS It took me a while to like the ending, because when I first saw it I was completely confused, because it made no sense at the time. But when I look at it now, I like that on a level it changes the entire film. It suggests two things, 1) That he is not Patrick Bateman, that he took his identity like he did with Paul Allen. 2) That the entire film was a figment of his imagination. The fact that he's not able to be caught is his own personal hell. This would also explain why when he would admit to people that he had killed people no one either took it seriously or they ignored it all together. These are the kind of endings in a film that I like, ones that completely changes your perception of the film that you just finished watching.All in all, even though the book and film are different in tone, both are equally excellent in there own way. I give the film what I'd give the book, 9/10.",American Psycho

A film which becomes funnier after every viewing; on a first watch the comedy is certainly not as apparent..the funniest moments come in the throw-away lines that you may not hear the first time around. Encapsualtes the over feel of the book; the screen play is superb selecting some of the best dialogue from the book. Certainly not necessary to read the book before seeing this; indeed if you read the book after seeing the film it enhances it, surely the mark of a good adaption. The attention to detail in the costumes/setting is also superb, as well as the make up etc. which has been much lauded in the 'business cards' scene, one of the stand-out moments off the film.

1042,aleccmax,A Work of Art,10,28 August 2017,"Scrolling through the 1 star reviews in this 'user reviews' section is arguably the most frustrating thing I've ever encountered because their reviews and unfair ratings are often looked at legitimate reasons for not enjoying this film. That being said, this film is not for everyone and has to be understood that it is not a typical horror flick but it is actually a social commentary to the extreme. That is the most important thing to understand in order to understand the brilliance of the circumstances and the characters and the dialogue that is in the show.For sake of brevity, I do not intend to write about every scene and not even necessarily the best scenes but I will be going in depth with examples.Generally there are certain aspects of a film that I look for when giving them a review. For starters I look at the most obvious, the plot. The plot is arguably the most important part of the film. This movie is a film about a young 1980's Wall Street executive who moonlights as a serial killer and a womanizer. Understanding that this is a criticism of 1980's Wall Street, each of the scenes has to be fine tuned to show the different social aspects of the lives of those executives and how significant appearance (inside doesn't matter) is. The film opens on a scene in a high class restaurant. Now this film has been criticized for being an over the top depiction of the singularity in culture during that time but I believe it perfectly. It slowly moves into a more direct viewership of the scene where two waiters are shown at two different tables introducing the night's specials. They are clearly different people (one is black, one is white, one is thin and one is chubbier) but they both speak in the same tone of voice and accent and say the same thing in the same way. Then you are introduced to the main characters of the movie who are all sitting together at a table. The values of each of the characters are shown during a brief exchange and also notes the rampant drug problem and how luxurious and expensive things were with ""Speaking of reasonable, only $570"" when the check came.Then the movie goes in deeper with Bateman's morning routine. He introduces it through a narration as we watch him complete the steps. It is important to note the regimented nature of his routine and how much of a process he feels he needs to go through in order to keep his appearance up. It also reveals an inner aspect of his character that even though he appears to be normal and similar to everyone else, he simply does not feel anything for the people that surround him.The next scene addresses the rampant sexism that occurred. Usually women were in secretarial positions or simply marrying into money and that is exactly what is addressed in the exchange between Jean and Bateman. She tells him he looks nice and he tries to tell her what to wear so she'll look prettier. In the following scene his fiancé is ""buzzing off in his ear"" about their wedding that he does not seem to care about almost making it seem like it was entirely based on appearances or frankly even arranged.The movie is frequently criticizing the singularity of 1980's Wall Street culture and there are many examples of this throughout the movie. For example when he finds the empty apartment where he had a bunch of dead bodies he found it white and with painting gear still there as if there was a quick cover-up. Now obviously this is an exaggeration of actions taken but why would anyone want Upper class culture to be tarnished by the discovery a serial killer and property values in a building overlooking the park would drop significantly. It all hints towards the concept that ""inside doesn't matter"" to people.The sheer brilliance of the characters is also shown throughout the film and even though Bale practically makes the movie with his character, how other people react to his antics is essential and really an under-appreciated aspect of this film. The directing is also necessary to this as Harron pointed the cameras at what she thought was necessary and it was not always the person that was talking. She often provided a contrast between other characters and Bateman by showing over the shoulder shots of how they reacted to his catch phrases and general disposition.The acting was also spectacular where in many snapshots of the film, you can see genuine emotion, the best example after he takes the first swing at Allen and brings up the ax for the next you can see genuine hatred and anger in his face.The score was also great in every scene and really set the tone. The most notable aspect was you would hear a sound of tension every time there was something that angered BatemanI wish I had more space to write more about this film but I do not. It is a work of sheer brilliance and a personal favorite and the ratings from people that expected a slasher flick are not fair to the actual quality of this film. It is constantly excellent from scene to scene and you never catch a break from something that's funny or interesting or just generally important to the story.",American Psycho

1044,marknix2000,Underrated!,10,6 July 2005,"American Psycho tells the story of Patrick Bateman, a Yuppie who works on Wallstreet to add to the vast wealth he was born with. He has it all, looks, charm, money, popularity and even social standing. However not all is at it seems, as Patrick inexplicably descends further into madness This is by far, an excellent, underrated film that disserves more then simple ""cult"" status. There are of course several attributing factors. Batman star Christian Bale amazingly plays the role of Patrick Bateman. He projects the image of Patrick's cold yet unfulfilling insanity remarkably. It's increasingly interesting throughout the film, to watch the phases in which Bale takes Bateman through. From his over eccentric attitude before his many killings, to his subtle wonder of himself in times where he approaches some form of humanity. The best thing about Bale in this film is each facial expressions is important, a simple thing as a smile can lye a hundred feelings behind it. The best example of Bale's acting in American Psycho is the ""Death By Heuy Lewis"" scene in which he needlessly kills fellow businessman Paul Owen (you may have seen him as ""Angleface"" in ""Fight Club""). In this scene the eccentric behaviour of Bateman is pushed to the extreme, followed by the climax of pure anger; which again is played beautifully by Bale.But it's not just about Bale, many of he inspiring Dialogue (See below) is taken exactly from ""American Psycho"" the original book by Bret Eastin Ellis. Each line has obviously been painstakingly considered especially since the entire book is written in the first person of Patrick Bateman American Psycho was directed by Mary Harron, whom admitting is not well known in the industry. Many find it interesting to not that Mary is obviously a woman. Considering the fact that the book was almost banned by Feminists when first published. When Mary took the helm, she allowed the story of insanity to be told but with taste.The only Fault of the film was the choice of Rees Wetherspoon, whom has yet to impress me in any film whatsoever. I personally find her stale and her acting transparent and 2D. Also, Bateman's ""friends"" such as Timothy Bryce were given little screen time; though they may not have been huge characters they were given more flesh in Ellis's classic.At the end of the day, these faults can be over looked when you can simply admire the glorious acting by Christian Bale and the wonderful Dialogue brought to us by Ellis and Director and Screenwriter Mary Harron. The film is not one for the light hearted, but defiantly one worth watching. An incredibly interesting story of insanity and a look on 1980s culture in America. If you haven't already, see this film! It's a must! 9/10",American Psycho
1045,deliciousyummycupcakes,What an Impression,7,1 October 2019,"The film does not take a gorey approach to murder, as some might assume. Christian Bale's role went beyond the topic of a crazed psychopath killer, but instead a materialistic hungry man surrounded by more materialistic hungry men. The film needs to be watched with a close eye in order to really comprehend its purpose.I am not supportive of the idea of abuseing women and murder, and I feel that the film was directed in a way that did not support it, but did create a feeling of discomfort to its viewers on purpose, enough to present the hidden inner lining. That being said, I am a huge fan of controversy. If the viewer is not open-minded to alternative and innovative ideas, this film is not recommended. The controversial elements were used as a tool to promote a disgusting amount of excessiveness consumerism takes on the yuppie culture. I appreciate the subtle comedy and ballsiness the movie takes on. It is rated R, so I don't believe the impression that the film made can be replicated if it was for a more impressionable audience. The plot is not what really sold me on the beauty of the film. It felt under-developed, however the avant-garde themes are admirable. The flick gets in your face.

And days later, I'm still chuckling. I'm highly anti-spoiler so I won't say more on that front but Christian Bale was brilliant. The nuance in his performance blew me away. It so easily could have gone cheesy but he hit it on the head. Perfect. Of course, it is a violent, bloody movie so, not for the squeamish. But that stuff really takes a backseat to the character study and the social commentary.

I think Christian Bale, was fantastic, and perfect as a Psycho.The film is not just about the character Patrick Bateman, the psycho. It's also a mockery of the whole 80's Wall Street scene.If you notice, pretty much everyone in his office looks and acts exactly the same. They are all white guys with brown hair, glasses, suits; they even have the same business card, although they brag about the differences.They are so much alike that nobody knows who anyone else is. Paul Allen always confused Patrick Bateman with Marcus Halberstrand. Then Bateman's own lawyer calls him ""Davis.""

Without reading the book first,the ending seems unclear however close attention to the film will define the idea that Bateman has lost his sanity. This is of course first truly clear when he is asked to feed a cash machine a stray cat (one of the more comedic aspects of the film). Bales acting is awesome. His dramatic skills stand out most clearly in the business card scene. However he is brilliant through the whole film. It seems as though he believes that his skin is only a plastic mask. Th acting is impeccable and script is great. Scenes are perfectly written. i particularly like any moment when Bateman discuss music with a soon to be dead victim.

1050,jim-ven,An alternate statement about the eighties?,6,23 January 2005,"I was passed the book from a friend some years ago, and way before any violence occurred I was finding it a hard read. The first few chapters where so full of over descriptive babel I found it hard to believe it had ever been published, there was just too much attention being paid to what seemed like trivial things. I got it in the end, Bateman's whole world thrived on detail and statement, many films may give you ""a slice"" of the eighties but this one gives it in a way that wont make you grimace with embarrassment and say ""jeez do you remember wearing things like that or listening to that"" its more likely to leave you feeling ashamed of a decade where everything became disposable and fake. But all this is just the backdrop to Bateman's world.Mary Harron did a fantastic job in bringing this to film,I didn't think anyone would go near it. I have had endless arguments with people about whether or not the murders where just all in his mind. Its my opinion that they did occur, but that nobody really cared.Why would they?, as long as they got the south east contract and could get into the most exclusive bars and restaurants. Something that I feel lost its impact from its move to film was, as a male; the uncomfortableness it left me with. There was chapters in the book that where quite obviously meant to arouse you, and they did. This would cut quite sudden to Bateman torturing and killing women. This was a very alarming place to find yourself in. Maybe I feel the film lacked this because I had already experienced this, and maybe because by this stage I realised it was it was a trick employed by Brett Easton Ellis to get you somehow closer to Bateman's state of mind, and get across the idea that the line between his enjoyment of sex and murder had blurred.This film got a lot of flack from women's groups who claimed that it promoted misogyny and depicted women as victims. All of my female friends that have seen the film or read the book have not seen this at all. They have in fact, compared to myself and male friends that have seen/read it; found it the least disturbing.Christian Bale was superb. While at the time I only knew him from his childhood film, Empire of the sun. I was a relief to hear he was getting the role as rumours had it that Leonard DiCaprio's was being considered for the role. I am not DiCaprio's bashing, but everything about the role demanded someone who could portray a powerful man and Leonard frankly wasn't built for the job.",American Psycho

I've seen others that should have had the Warning label. Since Christian Bale is my favorite actor, I can't say bad about him. I like his character and I think he looks SO DARN HANDSOME in business suits. And JUST business suits. I find the movie interesting because this was the first time I saw a movie that was from the ""villian's"" point-of-view and how he sees the environment surrounding him. And I think that was just brilliant and something different. Although, I became I bit rebellious that the fact Patrick Bateman was ignorant and sexually aggressive towards the women he fools around him. What about the prostitutes and the woman tied up on his bed yelling while Patrick is doing sit-ups? And the revolting blood stain on his pillow sheet at the cleaners. But I suppose that was all part of the story. It's a very realistic movie. Who knows? There may be perfect looking men out there with some mental problems out there who go through the same situations like Patrick Bateman. However, my favorite part was when Patrick and his business buddies fumble over business cards. I thought that was just ridiculously hilarious. I guess he doesn't want anyone to get the best of him, but SERIOUSLY, who on EARTH would make such a competition over business cards. Like the clients would notice the ""impressive details"" and the ""watermarks"". Overall, the movie is good. It kept me and my pals at the edge of our seats.

1053,danny-852-356356,An explained look into the deeper messages from American Psycho,10,1 June 2017,"American Psycho follows a businessman called Patrick Bateman who has the ""American Dream"" – he's good-looking, has a good body, and very wealthy, and so on. He indulges, bit by bit, in murdering people with no remorse or emotions. He describes himself as not having a ""single, clear, identifiable emotion"". Did Patrick Bateman really kill all these people or was it a dream or a fantasy of his? You could argue it was a fantasy as a lot of his killings were unrealistic and a lot of scenes were surreal. In my opinion, it really doesn't matter. What matters is that the reason Patrick Bateman killed people was to have a unique identity, to make himself as noticeable as possible to people, even if it was to the extremes of the most ultra violent murders possible. But why did Patrick Bateman want to put his identity out there to others? I interpret this film's theme to be the criticism of how self-obsessed everybody is in society to care about anybody else. The only things people really cared about in American Psycho were the most insignificantly mundane details of life – the ties, the business cards, the reservations made for dinner. All businessmen were practically the same, their only difference in identity being their ties. As all identities were the same, dull and forgotten, Patrick wanted to make himself noticeable to society. Throughout the film, he'd say crazy things straight up to people's faces such as ""I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?"" and ""I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood"". Yet people would either change the subject to something completely insignificant or simply ignore him – or think he's just joking. There was a scene where his victim was screaming and pounding at doors, and moments later Patrick ran after her naked, revving his chainsaw as loud as possible before killing her, and satirically, no one called anyone or did anything, as everyone was too immersed in their own lives. When Patrick had enough and began to kill anyone and a lot of people on the streets with a gun, and confessed everything he had done to his lawyer, not only had he gotten away with it but his lawyer thought it was all a large joke. The logical reason his lawyer found it as a joke was because Patrick said he killed Paul Allen, and Patrick's lawyer had recently met Paul Allen, meaning Paul was alive. This explains that all people's identities were meaningless and merged in with each other, and Patrick mistook Paul's identity for another businessman. In fact, identities are swapped throughout the movie. Patrick's murdering side is trying to stand out in society by any means possible – ironically, his other ""sane"" side is exactly what his ""insane"" side tries to destroy – his sane side is narcissistic and ignorantly self-obsessed. He takes careful measures to working out and putting a face mask on himself that represents his sanity. Beneath it he is flawed, and he must feel flawless. And when making love, he flexes in the mirror and winks at himself. His sane side represents everyone else around him. But his insane side, along with its ultra violence, wants to break out from a mundane life and have a noticed identity that's unique to all others, despite how no-one seems to notice anyhow. Wrapped up, Patrick Bateman has supposed schizophrenia – but what are the deeper thoughts to his charismatic businessman side and his psychotic murdering side? His charismatic side is the identity in which he forces himself to blend in to society, however his darker side is simply trying to do the opposite – make his identity stand out in society. But his identity isn't noticed, and as it doesn't work, Patrick becomes more and more frustrated, committing more and more murders, then cannibalising, then openly murdering people on the street, before confessing everything to his lawyer. But still, people either think he's joking or choose to ignore him, highlighting the ignorant narcissism of humanity in today's world. This is shown in Bateman's last words in the film, which are ""No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.""",American Psycho
1054,abhiiheartless,For all those who are confused after watching it,10,28 January 2014,"*contains spoilers*It's almost like we watch Patrick Bateman go from his normal life. We see a mounting anxiety in him of being mistaken for other people, of killing people and not getting caught, like the real estate agent. And we get to the scene where he's crying on the phone and confessing to his lawyer what he did, and then his lawyer doesn't even really know who he is. The idea being that he gets so hysterical he's just straight up begging somebody to listen to him confessing to all these crimes, and there's still no reaction, and it's almost like he gives up. And he's right back where he started; he' sitting in the same bar with the same stupid friends talking about what they're going to eat and what they're going to drink, and it's just like, this guy is out there, and there's lots of other guys like him. It's almost like alienation breeds serial killers, everyone's so disconnected, it really doesn't matter, it doesn't matter who you kill, it doesn't matter what you do. We're all just robots. And to me you're supposed to be left with a feeling of emptiness, like fear, nothingness, no one's paying attention, nothing matters",American Psycho
1055,owenepps65,A modern art masterpiece.,9,28 December 2013,"*warning spoilers* The movie adaptation of American Psycho is constantly neglected for its true worth by the audiences who watch it. The whole movie is based around the concept of ambiguity and the personal identity of the voyeur, therefore I believe this piece to be somewhat spectacular for its message of the society we live in. It focuses heavily on how we focus on the material possessions of a person rather than the aspects of their personality and value. This is especially clear through the business card scene as we see how, through the connotations of the card, Bateman is pressured and feels outdone, this is exactly the intentions as we are witnessing how society makes one become psychologically damaged in the struggle for social hierarchy. It is this idea of becoming the perfect social model, the 'American dream' that drives the insanity of Bateman as he pushes forward into his decent into madness. As far as the plot is concerned it is a fantastic representation of the human mind and more so a psychopathic human mind as we see how he potentially fantasises about killing people. The plot is left ambiguous so it is down to the viewer to change the perspective and look at what they think the ideas to consist of. I believe it is all a fantasy and the closest he got to killing people were the drawings in his notebook, the rest was a concoction of socially strained insanity and boredom in the sense that because he is 'perfect' there is nothing left for him to achieve. This boredom is then left to ferment in his psychotic mind and leaves us with his perspective, after all it is his narration and his story and seeing that he is insane it would be impossible for him to differentiate between his fantasies and reality, therefore giving us as the viewer his perspective.Relating back to the idea of fantasies, we witness multiple scenes with different themes, one minute we are watching a 'black comedy' full of sharp and horrific humour, then changing to a thriller and then to what some might consider a 'slasher' movie. Although this may appear to be bad editing, it is actually a way of demonstrating the idea of lucid dreaming and how each sequence flows into one and other. This is just a personal belief of mine as I see it fitting to the themes involved. To top it off the acting is phenomenal, an absolutely outstanding performance by Christian Bale, if it weren't for his acting I may have tuned out, because, as it happens, I was very confused by the initial events, it was only after wards, when thought was put in, that I saw the magnificence that it deserved. If you can truly see this movie for its representations of society and the deterioration of the human mind, as well as its outstanding uses of acting and mise en scene then it will truly blow you away, if still neglectful towards this piece then I urge you, sit up from your seat, the director has placed you there purposefully so that you are confused, they have given you an obscure angle, all you have to do is take the confidence to look from another angle, only then will you understand the true meaning, purpose and depth to this movie. It is a catchy artistic and well played performance, but more than that it is a beautifully mastered representation of the world we live in and how, if not careful, we can be trapped in the insanity induced nightmare of modern society.A truly beautiful work of art, both the author and the director deserve the audiences attention for such a sterling effort, very well done.",American Psycho
1056,emmaamylouiserobins,No Introduction Necessary,10,13 January 2014,"This is a movie I have seen at least ten times now, and every time I watch it I gain deeper insight into the mind of the protagonist, the director and of course, Bret Easton Ellis who wrote the novel on which the film is based.Christian Bale gives an epic performance as the twisted Patrick Bateman, who is sickened by the world around him and everyone in it, and who wrestles with himself as he sicks to end his internal pain by inflicting it on others. Whilst obsessed with success and optimising himself, he pushes himself into the 80s yuppie lifestyle and then rails against it, and seeks to destroy anyone who believes in it. He is terrifying yet compelling to watch as his character descends deeper into psychotic frenzy as the film progresses, and he loses sight of what is reality and what is not. I cannot fault his acting - it is crisp, clean and his erratic emotions come across beautifully to the audience.The supporting cast, in particular Reese Witherspoon, Willem Dafoe and Chloe Sevigny, were perfectly cast and gave believable performances in their three very different but complementary roles. The superficiality of Witherspoon's character, who does not realise how empty her relationship with Bateman is, presents a stark contrast to the depth seen in Bateman himself. Sevigny's character, the gentle Jean, is Bateman's one weakness. He sees in her his only hope for the future. She is the only one in the movie who shows genuine selflessness or a hope for a brighter future. Her innocence and purity is portrayed very successfully by Sevigny, with soft voice and wide eyes. Dafoe's character is one the audience finds difficult to predict, and this is down to the way that his character was played. It was shot three times where Dafoe played the role three different ways, which when edited were intertwined so there is no clear picture as to who he is and what he thinks. His excellent performance can then partially be attributed to Harron, the director.The direction of this movie is exceptional. It is fast-paced and layered with additional meaning. No word goes amiss as the audience is plunged into the yuppie lifestyle and the harrowing events unfold around them. The dark comedy comes through with great subtlety, it is a satire unlike any other. You would not expect such nuance and slickness from what many class as a confusing gore, slasher or horror flick. Anyone who claims it as these things has severely missed the point.The music in this film is completely the opposite of what you would expect. Many tracks are 80s pop songs, and this is one of the crucial threads through the movie. Bateman's extensive knowledge of 80s pop shows how he is a part of the culture that he so despises. The other music is considerably different, harsh violins which increase the suspense and darken the mood. The lighting progressively dims through the movie, mirroring Bateman's descent, until the closing scene where it is once again bright as it was when the movie opened. This is a neat, but horrifying ending, as it shows the cyclical structure of the plot. The confusion in this movie is part of its brilliance. Many of the actors look similar, wear similar clothes and accessories, work in the same company and do the same job. The characters also frequently mistake one another for somebody else. Many characters appear once and then disappear for the rest of the movie. Names are interchangeable, people get mixed up, and nobody cares apart from Bateman and this is only at the end when his mind is unravelling and he craves his punishment. Then there is the ultimate question of how much of this movie is reality and how much is fantasy. As the voice-over is Bateman, it is all from his perspective, and his psychosis is so erratic and unpredictable that the audience is left as perplexed as he is. There is a perfect moment near the end of the movie where the audience sees Bateman himself realise that what he is experiencing cannot be entirely real, leading everyone, including Bateman, to question what we have seen before and what we will see after. The first time I saw the movie, I would have only given it a seven out of ten, for the superlative acting, costume, lighting and camera work. I found the plot and dialogue difficult, and when I watched the movie a second time, I saw that this was the idea. I appreciated the intense, multi-layered craftsmanship which makes this film now one of my absolute favourites. It is Harron's indisputable masterpiece in my opinion, and well worth the watch. Twice.",American Psycho
1057,hblo2234,An excellent work,8,9 January 2006,"I saw ""American Psycho"" for the first time when I was younger. I didn't think to highly of it then, and I now know the reason. When I was younger, I could not understand the complexity of this movie, and the character ""Patrick Bateman."" And now, after seeing it again recently, I can truly appreciate this movie for the work of art it is. There is so much more to be read between the lines in this movie then in most others, it's one of those movies you can see 100 times, and still find something new that you missed every other time, and enjoy it all the more. Bale plays his role so well I think, I have read the book, and I think that he is perfect for the character. Though the book is MUCH more graphic, I think the lack of graphic violence in this movie actually goes in favor of it. It allows us to focus on the other things one could so easily pass up. If you have not seen this movie, you must go rent it, especially if you are somebody who enjoys GOOD MOVIES. not your average Vin Diesel flick. The eccentric character of Patrick Bateman is what this movie is about. It is the only ""horror"" movie I can look back on, and say, I have never laughed so hard from this, and not in a cheesy way, in a very good way. GO SEE THIS MOVIE",American Psycho
1058,Michael_Motyl,A must watch,10,1 March 2020,This movie holds a great place for me because of its themes and overall message of the film. It's a film even relevant today and I enjoy how the movie conveys its themes,American Psycho
1059,Kiernaan,Perfect!,10,9 October 2005,"This movie has it all. An atmosphere, great satire, violence, and replay value (for me anyways).The acting by Bale is superb of course. No one else could be casted for this role by a long shot. The tone in his voice is completely jerk-filled and you want to give him a high five every time he acts like the way he does. Through some well shot scenes, a good score and good acting, this movie managed to accurately display an exaggerated 80s Reagan era society. There are so many good lines that add to the cockiness of Bateman that it makes you smirk every time. I especially liked the dinner table scene where he talks about ending apartheid, world hunger, and stress less materialism, etc. but he obviously doesn't care about any of this. He just cares about being the epitome of knowledge...as well as looks, money, and being psychotic as well!I really don't see why the ending was such a problem for people. It's obvious it really happened. If it didn't, it would make the movie's message a complete failure. Why I think it really happened:1. Everyone uses each other's names. Everyone looks the same. Therefore, there is much confusion to which each person really is. Paul Allen confuses Bateman for another character and it goes like this for everyone. Also, every man is cheating with everyone else's girlfriend. It creates this cycle of lost identity. 2. The detective says Bateman was at dinner, so he couldn't have killed Paul Allen at the end. Obviously this is another case of what I discussed in the first point. Stolen identity.3. The violence was another extension of the satire. To make it over the top and completely out of control indulgence, why not add murder to the mix? If Bateman can get away with anything because he's the king of everything, why not it be murder as well? It's a great mix really.I also do not get the book vs the movie comparison failures. Yes, this is a movie, so no, they can't devote a complete hour to discussing the band Genesis, only a segment. Lets cry about it. The movie wasn't as over the top, OK well, you again have only so much time in a movie. Also, lets not take into consideration the ratings that fly with this extra violence. To me, it is harder to accurately convey Bateman and his over the top behavior with less violence, yet this film achieved it. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, but the movie is an adaption, and a perfect one at that. It is its own world.To top it off, the fact that Bateman couldn't cope with no consequences for his over the top actions was pretty great. Like many serial killers, they leave clues to try and get caught. What if you walked into the police office as one and they laughed in your face? From a serial killer point of view, I'm sure it would make your time a complete waste. So overall, his consumerism, materialism, intelligence, greed, murder, reached its climax and the only end result he would have liked was punishment, but now he has to live with this and he can't take it. He can't go any deeper with his escapades. I'm sure for a character like Bateman's, the only end would result in suicide so you would have to abruptly end this as did the book if you want to keep it going in the satire world.",American Psycho
1060,imdb-20-scaramanga,Some books can't be turned into movies...,6,26 April 2005,"If this film was a piece of its own, it would not be bad, but anyone who read the book sees: This film misses the monumentality of the book. While reading the book, you are disgusted by this man and his surrounding and get a deep insight into a society which always follows the money, a society which has used the ""American Dream"" that excessive that it is in danger to die. The reader of the book is bored by Bateman's wealth as he is. The reader misses any human behavior in that book for the first two third of the 550 pages. The reader is shocked by Bateman's only exciting things in his life of purified materialism: His sex and his violence, which is always connected.To make that book into a film is almost impossible. No sane mind will produce a 4-hour movie which would be immediately banned in most countries. But even when your aim is not a total conversion of the book and all its aspects, you could have made it better. First: The movie is too short! When you read the book and then watch the movie, you are waiting for some long hours to come, but then, after only 100 minutes, the film suddenly is over. There isn't the growing boredom of viewing (or reading of) Bateman going to endless dinners. Second: The crimes of Bateman are belittled! Yes, there is a man running with a chainsaw (a scene that I can't remember from the book, maybe it even wasn't in it), a head in the fridge and some bodies in a wardrobe, but it does not create the shocking atmosphere of the book. Maybe with voice-overs of the original texts, you could have gotten this effect. Third: The surrealism is missing. When in the book, Bateman says to a barkeeper ""I want to play with your intestines"", the reader is not sure if it is in Bateman's mind or if it is reality. In the film, you see this without questioning it.All in all the film may be a acceptable movie about a serial killer, but can never be as great as the book.",American Psycho
1061,gregbojo87,may be spoiler,6,18 July 2005,"Although I have yet to read the book, I have one thing to say, and this is to all movies based on books: Of course your going to think the book is better then the movie. If you read the book before you see the movie, then, in your head you will make your own little movie, and ultimately think that your version of the book is better then the directors version. Your probably asking why I'm saying this but its just that i read some guy bitching and moaning about ""the book was so more in depth and developed the characters and blah blah..."" well duh. Look the movie is directed by a director i have never heard of before so obviously it isn't gonna be a masterpiece completely like the original, hell JAWS wasn't even close to being near the book. No movie will ever surpass the literary form, EVER! Sorry i had to get that off my chest, this Movie is all in all pretty good, i rented it out of boredom and I liked it, it has some funny parts where you just kinda giggle and go wow he is totally f***ed up, but in the end it provides solid entertainment that people look for.",American Psycho
1062,derrickmcg1,psychotically.... average,6,15 August 2014,"I was intrigued about this movie hoping that it wouldn't turn out to be another generic ""psycho"" movie stemming of different versions of Psycho itself. But it lacked in a copious amount of areas. The screen writing the plain average with Christian Bale's voice narrations sounding as fake as his smile. Though his character was supposed to be this dull within, it could of been executed and performed substantially better such as Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs. The story had no depth deep down as the audience is left to frantically follow the life of the cereal killer, wondering what is the point of this movie?

Third:Pat is a sick murderer, but from the scene of the ATM to the scene where Pat enter firstly the business building is imaginary. I think it's clear, so many shots, he hunts down the guys and does not make mistakes, police cars, ATMs so on. But from the second time he enters the office the story is going on.

With the perfect cast and the arrogant acting is so realistic.The main character rambles like a narcissist and believes the smallest things are the most important.He is scary because he is exactly like all those people that work in corporate environments.The realize is the scary part of all movies and this seemed like a 1980's video flash back to the days of the yuppies. I would save time and just buy it.This way you can watch it alone and then put together a party of friends and co-workers that this movie would be perfect for. Its great on many levels.

The acting is phenomenal from Christian Bale and the other actors are very good as well. good music and great camera work, this movie really makes you think what happened at the end. But it's not a super serious movie and you should watch it as a satirical comedy about yuppies during the 80's and doing that makes this a very funny movie with memorable scenes you will remember and quote.I recommend watching it multiple times, it never gets old.SPOILER ALERTEven after watching this over 5 times and reading the book, I'm still not entirely sure if what happened was real or just ignored because of the vanity in the characters.

1067,kolanos-1,This is why the Taliban hates us.,10,2 December 2005,"For all those asking whether a fictional character in a fictitious movie had actually killed all those other fictitious characters, or whether he had imagined it all in his fictitious mind -- you should all be shot in the face, pronto. Why? Because if that's the first question out of your mouth after watching this biting, unnerving, and wickedly funny satire -- well, you're an idiot.But that's OK! Because what American Psycho is all about is idiots like yourself...emphasizing American in American Psycho. The descent of American values in recent decades, and the poignant examination of such trends is what is truly distubing about this film. That, or the scores of mindless fools who just didn't 'get it'. Maybe because the truth has a learning curve greater than zero (or less than?).Some see American Psycho as little more than a satire about materialism, and they're correct, but only in part. American Psycho, if you watch (or read it) closely, is much more than that. It is really an indemnification of what America has become. Bret Easton Ellis is quite possibly a patriot in this regard, for he sees the realities of this fading Republic and shows us all, in vivid fashion, the hideous and despicable qualities that have risen to dominance in our culture today.Patrick Bateman is the embodiment of modern America. Our obsessions, our fears, our indulgences, our sins, our utter despair.Unless we learn to face these realities, there is little chance of correcting them.

Our introduction to Patrick Bateman gives us a perfect insight into his life and mindset. We can tell how he has a healthy lifestyle, is wealthy and takes care of his skin. Yet we are also given the impression that he is callous and simply 'not there'. From killing women to comparing business cards, this movie doesn't fail to surprise. By the end of the film, you are left questioning whether any of Patrick Bateman's endeavours actually occur or if it was all just in his imagination. It is up put to the viewer to decide.

1069,locoxman56,Quite possibly the most important film ever made,10,30 January 2008,"I'm 19 years old. The first time I saw the film was in the summer of 2006 when I was 18. Since that day Ihave approximately viewed American Psycho 25 to 30 times and every time I see it I am simply more and more mesmerized by this piece of film. I may only be 19 but I have seen my share of great films over the years(i.e. The Godfather, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Sling Blade, etc.) These films that I just mentioned along with a very select few are those rare films that have no flaws whatsoever. American Psycho is one of these films. After viewing a movie I like to think back and review each and every aspect of the film, what could have been better, what scenes could have been cut, etc. I didn't need but more than a few seconds to realize this film was absolutely flawless. American Psycho is hands down the best film I've ever seen.After seeing the movie with a friend of mind, he was also astonished at how brilliant this film was and told me what he heard about the novel by Bret Easton Elis. He heard that in the book there is much more detail and a lot of questions could be answered and there is much more graphic detail than the movie. I then purchased the novel and read it. And like the movie the book opened my eyes to a new world. The novel was quite controversial at the time written in 1991. The brilliance of the whole thing though is the adaptation from novel to film. Obviously some of the detail in the book could never be shown in theaters and was cut for like I said for obvious reasons. But every single character is played to perfection, some of the names are different in the movie thats not uncommon in movie and novel comparisons. The movie to me is the perfect length for what detail is need from the novel. If you haven't seen the movie read the book and I will guarantee that you appreciate the movie more regardless of your current view of the movie.I had actually saw the movie Batman Begins before I had ever seen American Psycho and this was the first film in which I had seen Christian Bale.I viewed the movie and was blown away by Christian Bale's performance as this new aged Batman. So when I had heard about him playing the lead role in American Psycho I was very excited to find out if Bale was as talented as he was in BB. He was even better. I don't think I've ever seen a better performance by an actor in any movie. And after reading the novel it is even more amazing. When reading the Patrick Bateman lines in the novel, I could literally hear Christian Bale's voice in my head. Patrick Bateman is arguably the most complex fictional character every created. Not only is he misunderstood by most around him he also doesn't understand the significance of his own existence and for those who have seen the movie would recognize that you wouldn't even know that he feels this way by the way he acts around others. Patrick Bateman is 27 years old (in the novel he is 26) and works on Wall Street for a company called Pierce and Pierce. The extent of his job is actually not known as we see him just listening to music or watching TV while in his office. I don't want to give too many more details but Bateman his considered a ""yuppie"". Yuppies were considered to be the young , up and coming business men in the '80s. But if you have not seen this movie or not seen Christian Bale you are truly in for a thrill, this is not only in testament to the character Patrick Bateman but to the acting ability and talent of Christian Bale.I have seen this movie at least 25 times and this is what I wish I could see in every film and this is one of the aspects that makes American Psycho so brilliant. It pretty much sucks you in. You can't help but want to know why certain things in the movie happened and you just will not be able to find the answers.Performances by Willem Defoe, Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, and Jared Leto are mindbogglingly good. Willem Defoe plays Detective Donald Kimball and is at his absolute best even though he only appears in 3 scenes, those of you who have seen the movie can agree about why his performance is so excellent. Not too many people are huge Reese Witherspoon fans because of some of her recent disappointing roles but her role as Bateman's supposed fiancé Evelyn is second to none.If you haven't seen American Psycho I suggest buying the DVD as opposed to renting it because you will most likely want to watch it a couple of more times. If you have seen the film I'm sure a lot of you might think I'm over the top by me saying that this is the best film ever made. One thing I forgot to mention is the humorous quality of the movie especially Patrick Bateman. This movie has so many different background stories, questions, and thoughts. But it is so important because of the world Patrick Bateman lives in. But what world does he want to live in? I think you might know the answer if you have seen the film. Hopefully I haven't taken up all your time on this lovely day but this truly is important to all of us as a society. And if you haven't seen it please try everything in your power to see this movie immediately.So if you'll excuse me I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes.",American Psycho
1070,howard-martin-2992,Top favourite films,9,12 February 2015,"American Psycho. A brilliant movie, to say the least. Any more gore and/or female degradation and this movie wouldn't be as accepted and quoted as it is (at least in my head). Didn't do well in the box office, nor does it get as much recognition as one of Christian Bale's stellar - early performances.The movie has a very serious and dark tone to it, yet it has humour and eerie dialogue at some points. I can honestly say this movie never lets me down when I watch it - which I have easily done over 100 times in the past 15 years.The book is very well written - repetitive, like Bateman is in the film, but good. Much more graphic and grotesque than the movie by a long shot. ..is that a gram?",American Psycho
1071,kamipuo,Gripping while a bit confusing,8,20 June 2018,"Shortly, I was really fascinated how quickly I got used to the 'world' of that movie and the characters, I immediately wanted to know about them. The narrative was great and all the events kept me on the edge of my seat. Christian Bale was absolutely amazing and convinced me that he is unstable very well.
The ending left me confused and I just wanted to know if it actually happened or it was just a dream. Even though the director said that she was aiming to make it seem very ambiguous, I reckon that it was going more towards the idea of it all being in his head, although I was looking for reassurance. So the director's choices at the end a bit disappointed me.
Very excited to read the book, as I did not realise one existed.
Great movie.",American Psycho
1072,joemastrix,"If you love Christian Bale, you may not know what love is until you've seen this film.",10,14 July 2015,"Christian Bale brings on a hailstorm of awesomeness through his implementation of being completely emotionless, in combination with an utterly unstable train of reckless, careless, and utterly brutal acts of insanity. If you have watched The Dark Knight Trilogy and threw up in your mouth after finding out that Ben Affleck will be replacing Bale's take on Bruce Wayne, you'll find a whole lot of comfort in knowing that it doesn't matter what character Bale takes on, or may have taken on in the past. It's going to be breathtaking. With the uneasy movie title (American Psycho), it can and should only be expected that this movie will pull you in quick, and push you out hard. If you're an up-and-coming Christian Bale fan, you're in luck, because this movie is one that no one ever anticipates from the start. You'll know just what I mean when the credits start rolling towards the end.",American Psycho
1073,g_machado-11256,A great paced movie with an awesome performance,8,21 April 2016,"When I went to watch this movie I didn't expect much more than a good psychopath movie, maybe with a plot twist to get the notoriety it has. Well I was quite wrong.The movie depicts a suit man that works at Wall street and that could be easily identified by any viewer as psychopath, named Patrick Bateman and being played by Christian Bale. Being the star of the movie, Bale deliver a rock solid performance, that makes the character very captivating. Other big names on the movie is Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto, though it gets too little time on screen too really matter.As the movie goes you keep discovering, through discretely killing scenes or thought provoking conversations, more about the people around Bateman, and more importantly, about what the movie tries to depicts through satire: A society very materialistic and with shallow motivations, and someone that get so bored with this idea that goes on a killing spree to keep sane... or does he? with an ambiguous ending we are left to wonder if all the killing was just Bateman's imagination, or if it was real.As an overall the movie delivers nice writing, great acting, classic scenes and an end to keep a discussion going.",American Psycho
1074,lizardluv,If you're confused by the ending...,9,2 December 2006,"My take on the ending is that the last killings are so over-the-top there is confusion (intentional) about what is real and what might be in Bateman's head. But it doesn't matter, the underlying theme becomes clear regarding yuppie excess, and the soulless, emptiness and insanity exhibited throughout the movie. I didn't read the book (and I realize the book is more intense/brutal, etc) but the film gets its point across. What are we really laughing at here? What reflection is presented about American society, class, and bourgeois culture? Seeing how this was set in 1987, during the Reagan years, this film is every bit relevant today, and more so.My 3¢",American Psycho
1075,lsamak,"A brave, if ultimately unnecessary adaptation.",9,29 March 2016,"Christian Bale's performance as the deranged Wall Street serial killer Patrick Bateman is the elevating feature of this film. It is a performance of ultimate dedication and passion. Did this film have to be made? not really. Does it totally convey the hopeless and nihilistic themes of the book? not really. Fans of the book will be disappointed by the condensing of a 300 page novel into a one and a half hour film. However, the scenes that are not cut are executed with suitable panache and style, credit to Director Mary Harron. Much of the violence is toned down, and tastefully done, with a cool, sterile colour palette and smooth camera-work juxtaposing the terrible acts committed on screen. It also is executed in a way that brings a dark comedic undertone to this cult classic. This film intrigued me enough to go and read the book. Before I read the novel, I thought the film was amazing. In retrospect, it pales in comparison to the original. However, as a stand alone piece of filmmaking, it is utterly unique and noteworthy. I highly recommend it. Watch if you loved 'Fight Club', which shares many themes but examines them in a different manner, or the TV show 'Mr Robot (Which is heavily inspired by both novels/films)",American Psycho
1076,jeremyrmanis,American Psycho.......more than a horror flick,10,7 August 2005,"For those who have seen the advertised trailers, or have heard of this movie through unpleased viewers only, this movie is more than a horror flick. Even though the actual trailer for the movie is marketed as a common horror flick, don't be dissuaded. This movie is very telling about a genre in American history that has since evolved. The eighties in New York were a time that glamorized appearance without depth and ""style over substance."" This movie takes your mind through that period in time and shows viewers the horrible disorders of personality and shallowness of the soul that sought to ""kill"" those who would not fit in. Conformity, being a powerful motivator, drives you to do things that you normally would not. Patrick Bateman, the main character, played masterfully by Christian Bale, epitomizes the thesis stated above. His cold, dark appearance gives the full impact of what is one of the most controversial novels of the last 20 years. This is one of my favorite films because it is so telling about the human condition. Don't rent this movie.... Buy it.",American Psycho
1077,abihijaw,"Worst movie from its year,Bale sucked beyond measures",1,31 May 2016,"This is without a doubt the most overrated piece of trash I have seen in my entire life. All this movie had was a guy who killed people for fun\It's hard to summon up enthusiasm for a performance so rooted in bloody banality. I mean, as Patrick, Bale's most emotionally pressing dilemma is: Chainsaw or butcher knife?It's all soooo predictable. Sunday. Monday. Tuesday. Yada, yada, yada. Everything. The book was much better though,but then again it didn't have an overrated Hack like Christian Bale dragging the movie down constantly.This movie was terrible! I found it boring and stupid and the ending didn't make sense at all...definitely would not recommend seeing it! he entire thing is so shallow and masturbatory that it's very hard to care about anything that's happening. Even without a well developed character there was still the possibility that the result would have been entertaining, but the psychotic killer angle was executed without any suspense whatsoever. There never seemed to be any reason for any of the plot developments, and from the very start we are just given a character who wants to kill people for some reason. A Hollywood cheeseball overall. Bad music throughout. Everything felt fake.And Lastly I would like to add,Christian BALE IS THE MOST OVERRATED HACK OF ALL-TIME.PLEASE STOP ACTING AND SPARE US THE TORTURE.",American Psycho
1078,bobmobil,It's a pretty good movie,8,20 July 2018,The Wolf of Wall Street + Dexter + Donnie Darko = American Psyho :D,American Psycho
1079,devantedesigns,A classic.,9,6 October 2016,"American Psycho is an exceptional film because it's suspenseful and comical. Two elements that make for an iconic black comedy thriller. The film is an adaptation of Bret Ellis's novel, which has the same name, that originally served as a satire. The all star cast includes: Christian Bale, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon, and Chloe Sevigny. The director is Mary Harron, who previously worked on her debut film, I Shot Andy Warhol. Despite the fact that Harron was a relatively new director, the film had no shortcomings in flawlessly adapting the novel. The rating of the movie is R due to the sex scenes, profanity, and gore. The movie offers you an invitation into the mind of a psychopath while displaying the comedy of it all. Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale, is the main character and focus of the film. He's a successful investment banker that leads a double life as a serial killer. With Bateman often expressing psychopathic desires, the core of the film's plot deals with his thoughts through narration. This element gives the impression that the viewer is hearing the thoughts of Bateman, which makes the build up of the movie suspenseful. The victims of Bateman include both people he's acquainted with and strangers. Throughout the film Bateman displays different personalities: a corporate nerd, a witty and materialistic asshole, and an insane serial killer. The personalities previously mentioned eventually intertwine by the end of the film. There's an element that plays with psychology when Bateman frequently slips in and out of reality; it adds another genre to the mix of the juxtaposed film.Although the movie is focused around a psychotic man, there's still an element of underlying comedy. The dialogue and Bateman's personality is what adds that comedy. Bateman's outburst of vulgar, violent words towards other characters throughout the film is hilariously creepy because the other character doesn't hear him. He yells things such as, ""I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood,"" yet the bartender, the receiver of the quote, continues on normally. There's an axe scene where the killing is interluded by a history lesson of the song, ""Hip to be Square"", as Bateman dances around his victim, and later proceeds to bash his head in. At one point in the movie Bateman and his peers compare business cards as if it were a football game. These stated instances is what exemplifies the ridiculousness of Bateman. I am a huge fan of black comedy so I found it hilarious rather than completely morbid, and Harron's writing makes it easier to do so. The movie deals with a lot of ""inside the mind"" narration, which adds the element of suspense to further shape it into a thriller. As a viewer, I was on the edge of my seat to see how the next killing would occur because his thoughts foreshadowed his urge to kill. The cinematographer did a good job with adding suspense because some of the shots during the night scenes resembled that of a film noir. Pairing the film noir shots with suspenseful film music as Bateman scrambled to hide evidence after a killing made me ask myself, ""Is he going to get away with it?"" The suspense factor makes the thriller more interesting and engaging. American Psycho is a classic film. It's a classic notably because the scene with the axe has become iconic in popular culture, but also because of the remarkable delivery. The film utilized dark comedy and suspense to its advantage. If I had to give it a rating out of 5 stars, I would give it a 4.5 out of 5. It's a film that I continuously mention and recommend to those who have never seen it before.",American Psycho
1080,shahfahadking,Unexpected brilliance,9,13 November 2020,"The way the plot is set and with immaculate perfection it just shifts to something you never expected. that element of surprise is fantastic
""feed me a stray cat"" is the easiest giveaway if you're also stuck in the dilemma about the story being an imagination or not .
the eventual end is fantastic
the sympathetic yet unnerving end which relieves and confuses you is fairly unique,alludes you into a different realm. This movie checks our sanity and showcases the unnerving yet eccentric nature of human thought and imagination while describing our permanent struggle to disestablish ourselves from the enslavement of stagnant thought and the spontaneity of human consciousness.

""Don't shoot the hooker in the head while she's sucking your.......""....err...well, o.k., that was mine.For me, it wasn't a horror movie, or a suspense so much, but more of a black comedy. I don't think it would have been nearly as good without Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman. I think the match up of him and Reese Witherspoon as his fiancé is priceless. The two together are perfect. My two cents.",American Psycho
1083,CristiDragomir,"It is absolutely a brilliant masterpiece, put together by the director and Christian Bale",10,4 August 2006,"This is a magnificent movie. It is absolutely a brilliant masterpiece, put together by the director and Christian Bale. As of this movie i placed Cristian Bale on top of my favorites actors list. The man is simply glowing in this part, but i recommend that you also watch: Equilibrium, The Machinist.... Absolutely clear psychological study of the modern man that seeks knowledge of himself, but it is limited by the petty things in actual today's city life. A study about pain and will to reflect one's pain on others.

I would hope that people who have only seen this movie once and didn't care for it should watch it again and think in the context of a comedy- my two cents. I though that the screenplay was fantastic, especially the dialogue. Another thing that intrigued me was how the director used close-ups to capture the essence of the comdeic value that certain aspects of scenes contained. This use of heightened drama makes me laugh out loud every time I watch this film. Lets not forget the brilliant acting done by Christian Bale, who IMO, is the most gifted out there right now- perhaps a younger Gary Oldman who takes better roles.",American Psycho
1085,tristanrandomtools,Good but never great,7,10 January 2018,"An interesting premise which unfortunately started to lose me by the
end of it. American Psycho was certainly entertaining and I didn't
consider the movie a waste of my time. Christiane bale's strong
performance certainly elevated the movie as a whole. Had it not been
for him I would've given this movie a 5. Some of the murders committed
in the film ,especially near the end, were downright dumb and they took
me out of the experience as a whole. At the end the plot had started to
bore me and the eventual ""twist"" was more confusing then it was
shocking or surprising. A 7/10 is a fair rating for this movie. Watch
it at night.",American Psycho
1086,brendanmcfa,What a Pretentious Movie,1,8 December 2005,"I must admit to being extremely disappointed with this movie. The mis-anthropic message could not be seen as a metaphor for the 1980's 'greed is good' capitalist mentality, or as a commentary on prevailing western sensibilities. Rather it is self indulgent at best, coating a soft pawn movie with the veneer of social examination.The characters are 2 dimensional with no empathic qualities, The dialogue staged and contrived; although the acting is good you cannot polish a turd. If I had been a 13 year old boy watching this movie I would have been impressed by American Pscho's over-simplistic message, as a man I am not. 'Wallstreet' delivers a far more clever and concise commentary on the phenomenon of the 1980's. And, if you will allow me to retort, it's tag-line 'greed is good' will always stick in the memory.",American Psycho

1088,Ivny,Good movie,10,13 December 2018,"I found the movie very good! None of the reasons that address all the ""coincidences"" of the nuances of a psychopathic structure in an ultra capitalist society. A comment on the difference between visual and visual to ""feel bad"" inside, which is ""empty"" of emotions. The protagonist (psychopath) lived trying to fit in, trying to be the ""ideal"", but was diminished because he worked in his father's company. He never came to admire others or the recognition of colleagues. Even wearing branded clothes, good beauty routines, a ""perfect"" girlfriend, etc. He had a mania of cleanliness, of organization, of body worship, and, in addition to being very narcissistic, it was empty and cold. Everything was based on creating a perfect exterior, clothes, apartments, business cards, best restaurants ... even the sex movies were scripted, to make them perfect! the first to have been subjected to total control, subjugating and threatening the person's life? He liked music because he was extremely intelligent and rationally cold. It has no feelings, but how music can have meaning in many ways. He did kill all people! However, the film's biggest criticism is precisely the fact that no one has noticed it. There was no one there, someone was really importing nothing but status. The dictator was having dinner with the victim as he confused the names (as the investigator had already been commented on with the protagonist at a dinner party). The person in charge of the building, thinking about the sale of the property, covered the bodies found. And in the end, the protagonist had a crisis of nervous laughter, because it was not a society that did not see, did not see anyone! Finally, the lack of ""feel"" and the one who carries it, makes the psychopaths often kill. Trying to feel something, inflicting its victims. We are surrounded by psychopaths who do not kill, but inflict a lot of pain on people. In a narcissistic and capitalistic society, where it is more important than being, this can be very exacerbated and incredibly dangerous.",American Psycho

Which all guys can relate too he is Awall street whizz. And top of his game. He has plenty of friends that he does not even need. Basicaly you can tell he is a very materialistic person the way he explains his day at the start of the film. His quotes are amazing. A very addictive accent also. And most guys would love to be him Maybe take away the serial killer life and he is a perfect human. Just take my word if your a guy you will love this film i give it 100 stars.In my top 5 definitely. Bale is an amazing actor.,American Psycho

It was interesting to track man without any emotions, just with one intensive feeling - commit violence, strictly speaking - kill people - sometimes well-considered and sometimes spontaneously.
