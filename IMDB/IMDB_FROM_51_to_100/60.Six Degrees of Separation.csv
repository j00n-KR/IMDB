0,SnoopyStyle,Great role for Will Smith in sharp social commentary,8,1 May 2015,"Ouisa (Stockard Channing) and Flan Kittredge (Donald Sutherland) are upper class Fifth Avenue NYC private art dealers. Their prized possession is a two-sided Kandinsky. They recount the story of their dinner with wealthy South African investor Geoffrey Miller (Ian McKellen) to a growing crowd. Paul (Will Smith) interrupts the dinner showing up at their door claiming to have been robbed in Central Park. He supposedly is studying at Harvard with their kids Talbot and Woody and is the son of Sidney Poitier. All the while, he is shown practicing his con. Then they catch him in bed with Rick (Eric Thal) and they kick him out. However Miller wants to connect with Sidney Poitier. Then their friends Kitty (Mary Beth Hurt) and Larkin (Bruce Davison) come to them with the same story. They find Dr. Fine (Richard Masur) with a familiar encounter. The kids find out that it's their high school classmate Trent Conway (Anthony Michael Hall).It's an eye-opening performance from Will Smith and it's actually one of his best. He's being the slick performer and it's playing up his natural charisma. It is probably one of his most daring character and one which he has not gone beyond. I do wish he takes some chances in non-conventional roles to expand his repertoire. Channing and Sutherland are also terrific. It's sharp social commentary. On a minor note, J.J. Abrams overacts a bit as Dr. Fine's crazed son. His ridiculousness is somewhat funny. The kids generally yell and overact too much.",Six Degrees of Separation
1,Hitchcoc,Like No Other,9,22 February 2011,"I guess we can see the genius of Will Smith right from the start. This is a film about a chameleon who is able to create for himself identities suited to an intriguing game he is playing. He really wants to be loved, but has become so deeply entrenched in his charade that he soon isn't sure what he wants. He is a master of subterfuge with a smile and a wink. He claims to be the son of someone who is relatively reclusive and unapproachable. This gives him the opportunity to invade people's lives; but for what? It's his ""victims"" that grow because of him. He is searching for a family but needs so many assurances. He chooses the super-rich, which makes his job much harder. The performances by Donald Sutherland, Stockard Channing, and Smith, himself are quite incredible. I began by absolutely hating these people. They are so smug and pretentious that they make one gag. And that's why their redemption due to this invader is so poignant. They grow to love this young man in their own ways, despite the fact that he appears dangerous (is he; I don't know). Of course, the six degrees is the theory that we are all related in some way if we go back six generations. The thing asked is, how can we then be so different. A real surprise.",Six Degrees of Separation
2,claudio_carvalho,"Outstanding Performances, Confused Screenplay",7,30 July 2006,"In New York, the art dealers John Flanders ('Flan') Kittredge (Donald Sutherland) and Louisa ('Ouisa') Kittredge (Stockard Channing) are ready to have a business dinner with their South African friend and client Geoffrey Miller (Ian McKellen), when a wounded young black man comes to their fancy apartment telling that he had been just robbed in Central Park and asking for help. He introduces himself as Paul (Will Smith), a friend of their son and daughter in Harvard and son of Sidney Poitier, and the couple invites him to stay with them. During they night, they find that Paul is not who he claims to be. When they investigate the life of Paul, they find the hidden truth.The first time I saw ""Six Degrees of Separation"" in 1993 or 1994, I was very impressed with this movie. I liked the concept of the six degrees of separation between human beings, but mostly the acting of Will Smith, Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland. The very difficult and long lines were brilliantly presented by this trio of excellent actors and actress, almost as if they were on the stage. Further, the name of Stockard Channing in a film for me is a synonymous of high quality. Today I have just seen this movie again, and I maybe I am more critical with the years, but I found the screenplay quite confused. For example, the relationships of parents and sons and daughters are extremely aggressive from the side of the Harvard students, and I have not understood the point in the story. The affection of Louisa ('Ouisa') Kittredge for Paul Poitier- Kittredge could be a projection of what she would like to receive from her apparently ungrateful son and daughter, but her daughter actually talks to her. Anyway, this movie is intriguing and original and deserves to be watched. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Seis Graus de Separação"" (""Six Degrees of Separation"")",Six Degrees of Separation
3,lee_eisenberg,conning ever afterwards,7,13 February 2006,"Before Will Smith became associated with fighting aliens and rapping, he starred in ""Six Degrees of Separation"" as a young man who comes to a rich couple's house and pretends to be Sidney Poitier's son. But more than just focusing on him conning them, it looks at how his presence makes them have to reevaluate their lives.It seems that mostly, director Fred Schepisi went downhill from here. He was already well known for movies like ""A Cry in the Dark"". Since this one, he's had some good spots like that one with Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins (I can't remember the title right now), but ""IQ"" - while acceptable - was basically a popcorn movie, and ""It Runs in the Family"" apparently sucked. But this one is certainly good.",Six Degrees of Separation
4,jboothmillard,Six Degrees of Separation,6,24 October 2010,"During the days of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and just before getting the big break in Bad Boys, this was probably when the film industry really took notice of the up and coming black American star, from director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne, Fierce Creatures). Basically the Kitteredges, Louisa 'Ouisa' (Grease's Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Stockard Channing) and John Flanders 'Flan' (Donald Sutherland) are rich art dealers in New York. They are ready to make a big deal with South African friend and client Geoffrey Miller (Sir Ian McKellen), when they are interrupted by a young black man named Paul (Will Smith) coming into their fancy apartment. He says he was robbed in Central Park, and after they help aid his wound, he starts telling them about himself, claiming to be a friend of their son and daughter in Harvard. Secretly though, we see from some flashbacks, he has practised everything he is going to say to Ouisa and Flan, and how to say it, and they believe every word, even his claim to be the son of Sidney Poitier. Paul does absolutely everything to charm the couple, and Geoffrey as well, including making a home cooked dinner, and they kindly invite him to stay the night, while Geoffrey has been tempted to go through with the deal with Flan. The next morning however Ouisa and Flan find out that Paul is not everything he claims to be, when they find him making love to a man, and they are sure he was fibbing about much more than that. The Kitteredges try to investigate Paul further, and along the way they realise that they are not the only ones to be almost conned by this very talkative and very clever black kid on the block. After many revolutions about Paul, and people saying that Paul did do some good for their lives in some way or another, Paul calls Ouisa and Flan at home to make his confessions, they did try to see things from his side, but in the end there can only be tragedy. Also starring Mary Beth Hurt as Kitty, Bruce Davison as Larkin, Richard Masur as Dr. Fine, The Breakfast Club's Anthony Michael Hall as Trent Conway, Heather Graham as Elizabeth, Eric Thal as Rick and Lost creator J.J. Abrams as Doug. The title, also called the ""Human Web"" relates to the idea that everyone is at most six steps away from any other person on Earth, so that a chain of, ""a friend of a friend"" statements can be made to connect any two people in six steps or fewer. Anyway, Smith is the driving force of this film, he is perfect in his role as the supposedly knowledgeable con, Channing is also good as the wife in the con, and Sutherland does alright as her husband. It's a film that makes you think about how you know and find out about people in your lives, and it is a likable drama. Good!",Six Degrees of Separation
5,moonspinner55,Literate but meandering misfire,4,10 December 2006,"John Guare adapted his own hit play about a young black con-artist (Will Smith) who infiltrates the world of upper-crust, white New Yorkers, earning their trust and respect (and money) before his scam is revealed. Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland play a vacuous couple of privilege whose lives are fatefully changed by the smooth-talker, but while they are obviously a successful (and, one presumes, educated) twosome, Guare can't help but make them easy targets. The writer's literate set-up is better than his follow-through, which has a hazy point (the wealthier we are, the more shallow or foolish we become?). Director Fred Schepisi stages this like a TV show with flashy editing, yet there isn't anyone here we can relate to. Schepisi darts around in search of interesting chatter, but the whites are all rich ciphers and the kid the only one using his brain. Channing, as well as Heather Graham and Richard Masur, is worth-watching, but the rest of the film is stunted by a perplexing awkwardness. *1/2 from ****",Six Degrees of Separation
6,gradyharp,"'I want life to be experiences, not just anecdotes'",10,7 October 2005,"SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION is an outstanding play transformed to the screen with dignity but with a script that keeps us in the live theatre instead of in a motion picture. Not that that is a bad thing: the script by John Guare is brilliant. It simply seems a little static, with its marvelous plays on words, repeated phrases, and disjointed movements significant unto themselves but not really taking advantage of cinematic possibilities of flow.Essentially the tale of how a married couple who deal art (Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland - both in peak form) are so caught up in their superficial lives that they are taken in by a handsome young African American con artist (Will Smith) whose various antics bring the couple round to reexamining their shallow existence. Most of the story is related over art dealings and dinner conversations and are peopled by such luminaries as Kitty Carlisle, Ian McKellen, artists Chuck Close and Kazuko, Mary Beth Hurt, Bruce Davidson etc - a really fine ensemble. There are many social comments clustered in this story and it continues to play well after its origins on the stage and fifteen years after the movie was made. This was one of Will Smith's entries into film as well as one of the gifted Stockard Channing's finest roles. Highly recommended for repeated viewings. Grady Harp",Six Degrees of Separation
7,safenoe,This deserves more recognition,8,12 October 2016,"I remember seeing David Hampton as a guest on Donahue (one of the best talk shows ever) and it gave life to an already living script which became Six Degrees of Separation.This movie deserves more recognition. Sure it's talky, but the script is literate and if you're a fan of the Fast and the Furious genre, then please move on, please.Sorry if this sounds prudish, but seriously the gratuitous swearing almost overshadowed the movie. I know, I know, someone will say to me that swearing is a reflection of real life, so get over it!!! Maybe, but seriously, I never heard anyone complaining after leaving the multiplex that a movie didn't have enough swearing. Never.",Six Degrees of Separation
8,=G=,"Blaaa, blaaa, blaaa, blaaa, blaaa, blaaa.....etc.",5,6 September 2002,"""Six Degrees..."" tells a meager story of a pseudosophisticated art dealer of sorts in Manhattan (Sutherland) and his pseudosophisticated wife (Channing) who find a young black gay man kerplunked in their lives causing them to mentally scurry about not unlike Pooh (""Oh, Bother!"") and recount the experience to their friends...etc. ""Six Degrees..."" is theater on film with incessant dialogue rolling off the tongues of ultraglib characters, staginess, and obvious scripting none of which are exceptional. This flick lacks the stuff which sets films apart from stage and is likely only to be appreciated by devotees of the theater, dilettantes, critics, and the like. (C)",Six Degrees of Separation
9,lasttimeisaw,Six Degrees of Separation,6,31 May 2012,"Nearly 20 years ago, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION should be regarded as Will Smith's breakthrough role into the mainstream Hollywood, the film is adapted by a renowned play by John Guare, directed by Aussie Fred Schepisi (from A CRY IN THE DARK 1988) and Channing reprises her role in the film edition which has guaranteed her sole Oscar nomination so far. Ever since the opening strain, there are echoes of high-class snootiness abounds which sets the keynote of the whole conversation-foiled phoniness among its quite antipathetic characters, namely the Kittredge couple, then when Will Smith's young intruder emerges, the tension never alleviates although it seems that from the surface the harmony is unfeigned at the beginning and Smith's identity as Sidney Poiter's son is ever questioned, simply since he knows their children's name and his eloquent run-down of his father's filmography, but presented by Smith's black color, the unspeakable sensitivity of racism is well-written and underscored. Added that the paraphrase of CATCHER IN THE RYE is more or less a stratagem of showboating, so when all the boast ends, the ugly truth manifests himself, a satirically comedic story continues with a welter of less spectacular vignettes. Written from a true story, John Guare's screenplay is less staggering than the integral cast, Channing is superb in her final revelation scene but elsewhere, her ability is curbed and sometimes even a bit OTT, Sutherland is more natural and his role is much worse in both moral and ethnic gauges, still another great performance for his undervalued career. Will Smith is the linchpin to influence his low-life leverage onto these upmarket snobs, his performance is not so astonishing on account of the greenness and rawness, but he is luminous in front of cameras, although the fake gay-kiss is a let-down, Hollywood's conservationism is just as dreadful and stinking as its unimaginative blockbuster monopoly. Funny thing is that in the film, Smith make a spiel on the importance of the supremacy of imagination, which plays a grave part in distinguishing human from other species, but now has being over-abused in the mundane media, but the whole theory is too feeble to be taken seriously, neither by upper class nor by those less self-concerned great amount of masses. So who is the real audience of the film? The filmmakers behind it had not a clue! PS: a young J.J. Abrams is in the film as well, as an actor, who could expect that?",Six Degrees of Separation
10,vincentlynch-moonoi,Close to brilliant,8,4 August 2015,"This film is close to being brilliant. It is a totally unique film. And to top it off, a first class performance by Will Smith in what I would call his breakthrough film.Smith plays a young Black man who works his way into the lives of a number of people in New York City. Mostly his ""victims"" are the rich and successful, although one young couple befriends him, which ends in the death of the young man from suicide. In all cases, Smith's liaisons are designed to make him money. But later in the film you begin to realize he's not just a con artist; he's a deeply needy young man who lives in sort of a fantasy world. He wants all the good things in life, but only really sees his way free to get those things through hustling.However, it's not just Smith's performance that stands out here. The primary couple that he ""befriends"" are brilliantly played by Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing (certainly her best role). They're a totally absorbed rich couple who have no sense of realism beyond their own art-filled world of the rich.Supporting roles are played by Ian McKellen (who coincidentally has one line where he mentions ""The Lord Of The Rings"" nearly a decade before that film series was filmed), Bruce Davison, and Richard Masur. There's not a bad performance in the film.My only disappointment in the film is that in the end we don't know if Will Smith's character is alive or dead.Highly recommended.",Six Degrees of Separation
11,slightlymad22,Will Smith Should Have Been Nominated For An Oscar.,8,28 November 2017,"Continuing my plan to watch every Will Smith movie in order, I come to Six Degrees Of Separation (1993)Plot In A Paragraph: Based on a true story. An affluent New York couple (Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channinh) find their lives touched, intruded upon, and compelled by a mysterious young man (Will Smith) who is not quite who he says he is.Will Smith totally knocks it out of the park in this movie. He is utterly compelling!! You just can't stop watching him. Changing was nominated for an Oscar for her work here, and personally I think Smith should have been nominated too. He is brilliant. Donald Sutherland is as brilliant as he always is. That comes as no surprise, the surprise was Smith had a performance like this in his locker. Likewise Channing, who I had not seen in anything since Grease. Director Fred Schepi Wanted Meryl Streep, whom he has recently worked with in A Cry In The Dark for the role of Ouisa. However the film could never have been made if Channing hadn't been cast as Ouisa. She starred in the Broadway version, and the playwright, John Guare, stipulated that if the play were adapted to a film, Stockard Channing would have to reprise her role. Without Stockard as Ouisa, the movie was not to be made at all.The supporting cast is great too Ian McKellan, Heather Graham, Anthony Michael Hall and a certain J.J Abrahams.It's probably a bit too artsy and talky for most people here to bother watching. But I found it engrossing though.Despite positive reviews, the movie only grossed $6 million at the domestic box office.",Six Degrees of Separation
12,Rodrigo_Amaro,"""You just need to find the right six people to make the connection!""",10,1 February 2011,"At one point, in one of the most memorable moments of ""Six Degrees of Separation"" the rich lady played by Stockard Channing says this: ""I read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six other people. Six degrees of separation between us and everyone else on this planet. The President of the United States, a gondolier in Venice, just fill in the names. I find it A) extremely comforting that we're so close, and B) like Chinese water torture that we're so close because you have to find the right six people to make the right connection... I am bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people.""In a sudden event that changed her life to the point of realize that we are separated by six other people, before all of this happen Ouisa Kittredge and her husband Flan (Donald Sutherland) lived a perfect and wealthy life in all the New York luxe as Art dealers until an injured black man appear on their door claiming to be stabbed while walking near by their house. How did he got there and why did he got there? Because he studies at Harvard along with the Kittredge sons. Paul, this young man (played by Will Smith) is taken by the couple who gets impressed by his eloquence, his mannerisms and knowledge of arts, Kandinsky double paintings and because he happens to be....Sidney Poitier's son!But the world keeps on turning at its usual in Kittredge's house just when they realize that this guy is not what he says he is, after being discovered sleeping with another man in their house. And after some strange series of coincidences the Kittredges along with friends who met this strange man they get desperate to find out who is this guy who seduces everybody and then disappears, taking something with him but at the same time injecting a marvelous and different experience in the lives of all of those rich families.John Guare's play is adapted to the screen with elegance, a funny charm, never ironic or satirical, and a brilliant drama that knows how to be more than just a statement over the empty lives of wealthy persons that becomes interesting when a stranger man appears; it is a look into everyone's lives and the events and things that can changes us in a positive way even though we don't know that it was a good experience in the moment but later there's that click in the head and you say ""I get it!"". It makes you understand the world around you and change things, experience different things, look in a different perspective. It has the same quality of Pasolini's ""Teorema"" but it is less dramatical, more positive and funnier!The quality of the performances presented here are at its best: Stockard Channing is amazing reprising his role in the play as the rich woman who entertain her friends with the stories involving Paul; Donald Sutherland is always excellent and competent in all of his roles and this is a great role for him. He really should play more millionaires in films because he has a powerful presence on the screen, charming the viewers even while playing bad guys (which is not the case here). Completing the principal casting we have the young Will Smith dominating in an important role, and one of his best performances of all time. The supporting cast includes Bruce Davison, Mary Beth Hurt, Ian McKellen, Richard Masur, Eric Thal, Heather Graham, J.J. Abrams (way before he creates a series called ""6 Degrees"" and ""LOST"") John Cunningham and Kelly Bishop (stars of the original play making a cameo in the film). Fred Schepisi direction is fantastic, and the musical themes composed by Jerry Goldsmith suits the film very well.""Six Degrees of Separation"" is another case of an excellent but almost forgotten film that many people will never heard of, or never watched. And the strangest thing about this fact is that when of this release it was well received by critics, almost a consensus in brilliant and positive reviews but it didn't live up to be a more recognized film even with nominations for the Oscar and Golden Globe (Best Actress). My theory: lack of home media distribution, lack of exhibition on TV and perhaps some viewers were really shocked with the plot. This film didn't connect with a larger audience, which is sad, but at least it connected the right viewers to see that this is a masterpiece, still relevant to this date. 10/10P.S. some years ago I managed to get a Dvd of this released by a strange division of MGM - not the original one and I know because they're real stuff and there's quality material. Unfortunetaly, the Dvd copy I have goes to my hall of shame since it's edited down to the core: the whole Paul thesis on ""The Catcher on the Rye"" and its importance is cut out, and part of the sexual content too. Outrageous. Glaldy I knew those moments vivdly and never gotten out of my head. I only got back now because I read the play and it made my remember those parts and I'm not sure if I'll ever see them again unless internet or a good distributor re-releasing it.",Six Degrees of Separation
13,FiendishDramaturgy,It Changed My LIfe,9,23 February 2009,"This film not only looks at a mentally disturbed youth on the streets of America, it also looks at intelligence, sensitivity, articulation, and heart. This is not the best role Will Smith has ever taken, but it is his best performance, ever. I also have to say that it is by far his most human one. This is truly interesting, but beyond that, it, without effects, CGI monsters, or multi-million dollar explosions, completely entertains.More importantly, it teaches tolerance, eloquence, and how to obtain the ability to love. This film introduced the Six Degrees of Separation theory which haunted Kevin Bacon so completely until he realized it was a form of adoration rather than belittlement. Channing, Sutherland, and Smith are excellent herein, and it is their performances which rise to the top like the best cream.This is extraordinary in its lessons, lovingly taught in such a way as to disallow your knowledge that you have learned anything until it's too late.This is still surprising.It rates a 9.0/10 on the Drama Scale from...the Fiend :.",Six Degrees of Separation
14,Lechuguilla,Chaos Control,8,26 August 2007,"A charming young man named Paul (Will Smith) insinuates himself on a rich art collector named Flan Kittredge (Donald Sutherland) and his wife Ouisa (Stockard Channing) at their posh Manhattan penthouse. The film is based on a stage play; most of the scenes take place indoors; and the script is heavy on dialogue.One might conclude, with justification, that the film is a spoof, or satire, of chic, artsy types. Paul is an intruder, albeit a smooth-talking and charismatic one. He introduces an element of chaos into the controlled lives of Flan, Ouisa, and their high society friends. Indeed, part of the film's charm is listening to the babble of these rich snobs, amusing in their haughty, insular attitudes, as they react to Paul's behavior.But, if it has a satirical plot, the film also has a serious message; namely, that as individuals, we are all bound to everyone else on the planet by a trail of six people. That's a very erudite concept. Yet, the film's plot does not carry through on that lofty message with any ""degree"" of profundity. On the other hand, given Paul's rather obscure motivations, a variation of that message might be more consonant with the actual theme of the film, as applicable to Paul: ""... how everyone is a new door, opening into other worlds"".The overall plot of the film seemed a tad confusing and disorganized at times. Paul's persona conversion in just ""three months"" did not seem credible. And some of the film's younger actors overact their roles.However, the costumes and detailed production design are terrific. Jerry Goldsmith's tango background music, with all those violins, is wonderful. The film has excellent color cinematography, with some good shots of Manhattan. And, as a real bonus, Kitty Carlisle makes a cameo appearance toward the film's end.Watching Stockard Channing act is always a pleasure; her terrific performance here is one of the main reasons to see the film. ""Six Degrees Of Separation"" likely will appeal to more sophisticated, urban viewers, people who appreciate cinematic detail, subtle humor, and rich, elegant film sets.",Six Degrees of Separation

I found it a little boring in parts and yet brilliant in others. I was a sales person in the 80s and know a little about puffing!! Will was perfect at it, it's not lieing its puffing!! A fine line i learned to master however this movie is a slow burn as they say and I have A.D.D. so my concentration wanders in slow burn movies. It was a solid 6.5 only because of the great performances the story started out fantastic but then dragged and the ending was just ok. I get the meaning of the movie I related to it in so many ways. I was a young aspiring possible executive and was offered a big job in New York flew there and met all these pompous old white men and I said no and stayed in Minnesota. Anyway it's a decent film and if you're a will smith fan it's an absolute must I think its 1 of his best performances.",Six Degrees of Separation
16,rosscinema,Absorbing script and performances,8,5 June 2003,"This is the film that made even the most harshest critics admit that Will Smith had real potential as far as being a serious actor is concerned. This is the story of a young gay hustler named Paul (Smith) who knocks on the door of Ouisa and Flan Kittredge (Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland) and tells them a story of being mugged and also being the son of Sidney Poitier. He says he knows their children from college and remembered they lived there so thats why he came. After a lot of talking and impressing them he cooks them a nice dinner and they invite him to spend the night. They also loan him money but in the morning they find him with another man and they kick everyone out. The Kittredge's talk to their friends and find out that they all encountered Paul as well but were afraid to say something because they were embarrassed. The films title refers to the fact that we all know everyone by six people or degrees. The main focus of the film deals with how this young man made these characters take a good hard look at themselves and the relationship they have with each other and their children. The writing is very sharp and for most of us what is being said onscreen can easily go over our heads. Its a very intelligent script that forces the characters to see things that they seem to take for granted. Directed by Fred Schepisi who has shown a real knack for filming plays before and he also has shown to be very good at making films that are more character oriented. I remember one of his first films from the 70's called ""The Devils Playground"" and was impressed at that time by his direction. What really stood out for me though were the performances. Will Smith seems to tackle this complex script with an all to easy manner. As I watched his performance it was clear that he really understood the script and his character. You don't see that everyday from such a young actor, especially one that has limited training. But for me the best performance comes from Stockard Channing who was in the play as well. She's always been a very strong actress and a very underrated one at that. While watching her character in this film Channing does a wonderful job of allowing the viewer to watch her characters attitude change from the first scene to the very last. It really is Channings film and she received a well deserved Oscar nomination for it. Its one of the best in her career and its the driving force for the film. Casual film watchers may be put off by the sharp dialogue at first but I hope they stay with it, its a very good film about self realization and all the actors here are terrific.",Six Degrees of Separation

18,gangstahippie,"Strong Performances, but could have been a bit better",7,7 February 2010,"Flan (Donald Sutherland) and Ouisa (Stockard Channing) play a typical upper class, rich, yuppie couple in New York City. On one faithful night, a young man named Paul(Will Smith) comes to their house saying he has been mugged and that he goes to school with their children at Harvard University and is the son of veteran actor Sidney Poitier. He is quickly loved by Flan and Ouisa due to his charm, wit and knowledge of literary works such as ""Catcher In The Rye"". However, after finding him and another male in their bedroom, they kick him out. As they speak with some friends, they find out that Paul is in fact a con-man who charms his way into the homes of the upper class and throughout the film, the couple, along with other people who have encountered Paul, try to find and have him arrested while Ouisa also finds out about herself. Six Degrees Of Separation was adapted from a play of the same name, made by John Guare(who also wrote the screenplay for this film), which was in turn inspired by a real life event which happened to a friend of his. The film was directed by Fred Schepisi. Let's start with the positive. The acting in the film is top notch. We have big names such as Donald Sutherland who has proved himself to be an excellent actor in countless other films such as ""Ordinary People"". Stockard Channing, who you might remember from the musical/comedy ""Grease"" also plays a good role. But the biggest surprise in this film is probably rapper/actor Will Smith. At the time of making this film, Will Smith was known as the rapper ""Fresh Prince"". He also starred in the popular comedy series ""The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air"". This was his first dramatic role, and he was simply brilliant. My biggest problem with this film was thatit just was not that interesting. The plot itself was somewhat intriguing, however I did not like the way it played out. There were quite a few times in the film where I was completely lost and did not understand what was going on. The film also dragged in a few places and I feel some portions could have been either trimmed or completely taken out of the film. An example of this is during a scene where Will Smith's character is staring at the camera and reciting a very long list of the films of Sidney Poitier. I understand it was essential for his character to have knowledge of Poitier and his work if he was to pretend he was Poitier's son, however we (the viewers) could have lived without that scene. In conclusion, Six Degrees Of Separation is a fairly well made film with strong performances and a somewhat intriguing storyline, however I found it a bit boring and overlong at times.",Six Degrees of Separation
19,Howlin Wolf,"Takes the form of a dour sociology lecture, more than anything!",2,13 August 2004,"""All you've got to do in order for the bourgeousie to clasp you to their bosom is appeal to their vanity and avarice"".  Dead on-target though that assessment may be, it makes for an insufferably grating few hours of film-watching.  Having to squirm through footage of fine actors INTENTIONALLY masquerading as obnoxious twits may not EXACTLY be my idea of torture, but it came perilously close to it on occasion.The only possible redeeming feature of this I can see would be as a vehicle to showcase Will Smith's talents as a straight dramatic actor.  Having offered this as some form of mitigation, if you really do want proof of his capabilities that badly, then ""Ali"" is a much better and more worthy demonstration.  If ever there were an argument for pretentious and stultifying dull playwrights to confine some of the vacuous twaddle they peddle strictly to the theatre and nowhere else, then ladies and gentlemen, this movie may well be it.  I found it to be staggeringly tedious and irritating, but if you're looking for something to set your teeth on edge, then this could just do the trick - It's seriously about the only thing it managed to achieve in MY case!  2/10.",Six Degrees of Separation

Will Smith plays a con man who insinuates himself into the lives of a bunch of clueless rich people, and does a damn good job in his first major film role. Not only that, but everyone is great in this. And it was creatively filmed and edited. As an aside, there are blink-and-you'll-miss-them cameos by future directors J. J. Abrams and Oz Perkins. And perhaps the funniest part of the whole thing an extended discussion about whether or not they should make a film version of CATS.

23,harry-76,Challenging Assignment,7,11 November 2002,"Converting this hit Broadway play to film posed a real challenge.How to ""open it up"" so that it worked as film, was Director Fred Schepisi's challenge to his production crew. What was successful onstage needed to be properly converted.The original playwright John Guare also scripted here, and did a respectable job with a tough assignment.  The production ended up being edited in a kind of ""patchwork quilted"" manner, often with mixed results: the constant juxtaposing and vacillating of scenes seemed to become redundant at times.The cast did good work, though.  Each lead--Donald Sutherland, Will Smith, and Stockard Channing--brought his and her own distinctive persona to their respective part.To focus in on Channing, she certainly has enjoyed a remarkably varied career, with an almost breathtaking array of fully developed characters. Although she's been in the business working constantly for over thirty years to date, she still looks great.  Her emotional range is enormous, and every part she tackles is intelligently realized.The currently long running tv series, ""The West Wing"" is a case in point, in which she constantly appears as creative and energized as in the first episode.  Even after playing ""Six Degrees"" for four years at Lincoln Center, her film work here looks completely fresh.In an interesting bio on Bravo, Channing revealed that she's happy to be where she is: sort of on the ""second-tier"" of the ""star ladder.""  As fine as she is, she doesn't have ""It"" like, say, a Julia Roberts--but then she admits to being happy ""not surrounded by armed guards of photographers all the time.""  Thus she can walk down a street in relative obscurity.  Yet when viewers see her in a production, they recognize ""that face and that voice."" (Personally, I always thought she might've had better career luck going by her real first name, ""Susan."")""Six Degrees"" is admittedly quite a talkfest for film, a kind of an intellectual exercise, not for all tastes.  One has to really focus in and keep the brain attentive.  For those who have the energy and willingness to do so, ""Six Degrees of Separation"" offers a most intriguing and enjoyable dramatic experience.",Six Degrees of Separation
24,Pedro_H,Good acting - but too clearly a so-so stage play.,6,9 February 2005,"A small time street conman (Will Smith) talks his way in to an uptown New York apartment with the aim of hustling a few bucks and a free meal - but things develop in ways neither party could have predicted.I always says con-men and gigolos know more about the human condition than most university professors. While the professors live in their ivory towers preaching to note takers, the con has to work his/her knowledge in the cold world of reality.This film, developed from a play, gives mixed messages. The central couple are art dealers, so they know a little about hustling, charming and selected truths themselves. Meanwhile the black con Paul (Will Smith) is very street level. All he has is a silver tongue.(David Hampton - which the story is based on - died of AIDS without a penny in the world.) The story is interesting enough for a while, but the lack of drama soon makes itself felt. In all con stories there is only two threads of drama: Will the mark go for the con or not. In most such stories the author goes in for a bit of both - to get in the maximum drama. I won't say what happens here.The green edges of the chattering classes are exposed and the acting is first class, but I wasn't sure what this adds to the sum of my knowledge. Paul is a failure and maybe suffering from a personality disorder. He is in the wrong game because a silver tongue could take him far in this world - all goods need selling.I praise this film more for being different more than being good. It is a mediocre script and the tricks it can pull are limited. Its main plus is proving that Smith can act quite well when given the time and the space.",Six Degrees of Separation

The film starts from nowhere, goes nowhere and ends up nowhere. The film tries to be intellectual for the sake of being intellectual, and not because it has something to say. As a matter of fact, it has nothing to say, apart from the fact that rich kids are alienated from their parents in modern society and spoiled by ""having"", which is rather obvious, and this is just a footnote of under 5 minutes in a movie that lasts 2 hours! The rest is... simply nonsense.One gets the feeling that this film is something like modern art; the viewer is not supposed to understand because he is an inferior creature to the artist who is the only one who has been enlightened. Since humans however, do not like being inferior creatures, they say they understand (even if they don't) and praise the genius of the artist simply so that they too can feel as ""enlightened"" themselves... This is in my opinion why most critics praise this and similar movies, books, paintings, etc...On a positive note, one has to say that Will Smith's performance in his cinematic debut is fantastic! This is definitely not something one can see every day.

Will Smith acts his pants off, well quite literally in some scenes, but he is superb in this role, and acting along such names as Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland, both of whom are spectacular in their roles. A story based around the idea that everyone is connected to everyone else by a maximum of six other people, it's just finding those six that make the link, and this is turned into an extremely interesting story, told in a series of anecdotal discussions between the main characters and their friends and business partners at various different social occasions. You find yourself drawn and fascinated to the tale as it unfolds, almost feeling as though you are one of those people, eager to hear the next step in the tale. However, I felt somewhat disappointed in the ending, almost as though it didn't fit and came out of nowhere. Yet the ideas of the stranger giving the couple more than they gave the stranger was a good one, I just think what they finally got wasn't what the story neededbut then, sometimes that's life.

Granted the acting all around is superior. But the plot, the storyline. Too improbable, too unrealistic, too far fetched as if anyone would let a complete stranger into their homes in New York City. Please, get real. The antics of the college kids are too ridiculous for even words to describe. It is the story of an underprivileged young man who wants to rise above his station in life by fooling the unsuspected rich people he comes to learn about. An inventive and imaginative script, but just too ridiculous for me. The Paul character seems to have charm magnified 1000 percent that he can hoodwink others--even so much as to have sex in a horse drawn carriage with a very straight man. His charm is that powerful, that captivating that he beguiles everyone getting them to rethink their values and mores at the end of the film. The end of the film. I could not wait until it ended.

34,copperncherrio,New Respect for Will Smith,9,13 March 2011,"I have gained new respect for Will Smith, as an actor, after this movie. Not that I didn't have much before As much as I adore his personality among other talents, I really didn't expect him to pull off this role with such ease. Considering the difficulty.Paul is one of our main characters, who suddenly appears at a rich couple's home (who are art dealers). He's stabbed after a mugging and dressed in fine clothing, he claims to be the couple's son and daughter's friend from Harvard. After going through detailed knowledge about their children, he woos the dealers and their business guest with his charm, knowledge, and deep insight into the world (at this point Will Smith delivers some great monologue). Later the plot ensues and you find out the Paul is not who he claims to be and the mystery unravels through dinner conversation and anecdote.This movie is based on a play, and through the movie you can clearly see the strength of the dialog carries the story as well as the actors who deliver them. I love the movie for its depth in simplicity. How it uses conversation to draw you in rather than the typical action. It uses conversation to reveal the action and mystery that you so desire.My favorite character in the movie is Ouisa Kittredge played by Stockard Channing. She's the main character who is closest to Paul and grows after this experience with Paul.Do not be mistaken, this movie is NOT about a bunch of rich snobs coming to their way after being exposed to a black boy with promise and potential but no means. No, there is perhaps 5% of that in this movie, and there is no strong pretenses with this film. It goes deeper than just a sympathetic rich white lady, much deeper indeed.This film may not be for everyone, but it is for those who love good dialogs and monologues and for those who love plays ( or at least don't mind them).(the kid's were stupid and pointless one dimensional characters, but that's my only qualm).",Six Degrees of Separation

Yet a complete stranger touches them to the core with his cleverly fabricated stories and irresistible charm designed to play off  that very longing. While it's the same longing within himself that motivates his charade.  And so the world goes round in mixed up confusion. Great look at the existential angst of modern society done with intelligent, sardonic humor. This is one of the more thought provoking comedy/dramas you'll find. It's a searing look at modern interpersonal relationships and how they can be so lacking of any true human significance, centered more in material gain, business opportunities and social climbing.

39,shrine-2,Among the greatest films of the 90's,10,24 December 1999,"There may be some who see the characters in ""Six Degrees of Separation"" as unbearably shallow; who find the creature comforts of the Kittredges and their discussions about art effete; who focus on the sickliness of a young man who would envy them and try to enter their world under false pretenses, but what I see is how difficult a task it was to get us to relate to these people and what a prodigy the makers of this movie have pulled off.""Six Degrees of Separation"" is not an easy picture to like.  Ouisa and her husband are well-off and affected.  The interloper Paul is cunning and heartless.  But the mess that ensues with their meeting seems to usher in a breath of brisk air into the lives of each.  The Kittredges begin to see how musty their existences have become, and Paul begins to understand deeply what pain his deceptions have created.  The ruminations about life and art that writer John Guare touches on seem way beyond the scope of my meager comprehension, yet you feel you know--intuitively--that they are something of the highest order.  (I'll never forget what wonders he wrought with his ""Atlantic City."")  And there isn't enough I can say about director Fred Schepisi.  In fact, there is no plainer way to say it; he is one of the greatest directors working in movies today. (There is no one alive today that could have made a movie like ""The Russia House"" with the same astounding dexterity.  And ""Six Degrees"" is just as complex a sensual experience.)It was clear from the sitcom ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" that Will Smith had star potential, but what wasn't clear was that given the right role, he would open up in the minds of some of us a new set of possibilities in the world of acting.  Smith exhibits an acumen as Paul that's on a par with a performance like Dean Stockwell's in ""Compulsion."" He's that good.Donald Sutherland has never affected me in quite the same way as he does here.  He's the right actor to bring John Guare's contemplations on art to the screen.  The camerawork and pacing of the scene follows Guare's lead on the theme, and Sutherland gives in to the moment with delicacy and breathless ardor.Stockard Channing, on the other hand, has a more difficult task.  She needs to play a cultured woman protected from adversity and give it emotional weight.  She almost manages it, but the ending of this picture fails her, I think.  It needs the same sophisticated hand that the rest of the movie has. Maybe her going back to see Paul in jail, or going to a place where they play somber music only Ouisa can appreciate and watch her drift off into another world than the one she lives in.Suffice it to say, ""Six Degrees of Separation"" is one of the greatest movies ever made in the 90's.

It manages to be about the worst offender in two of the worst ""gawd-this-flick-sux"" categories. First, almost everyone in the flick acts like a total moron most of the time. Sutherland acts like a coherent person would a few times, but then he just reverts right back to moron- mode. Only House of Sand & Fog can match this for requiring everyone to be moronic in order for the movie to move forward. Second, it is just pompous celibacy of the kind common to people trying to act educated. Putrid, pompous, puerile, pretentious pablum. From the first scene to the last. Every single scene. How did they accomplish that? Only My Dinner With Andre comes close, and even that had some good stuff stuck in the private-parts of the pablum. As I reviewed Andre, at least it has some honest truths. (but the reality is that the people who will give it a ""10"" are the exact people who these truths are most honest about. Hypocrisy defined.) This bucket has nothing but swill. I guess I can say one other good thing about it. It continues the tradition of movies that somewhat accurately portray the inhabitants of the two worst places I have ever lived. People, over the age of roughly 35, in NYC are mainly pompous celibates. People in SW Connecticut are mainly obnoxious A-holes with no family life nor concern for the people around them.

Stockard Channing, Donald Sutherland, and Will Smith give superb performances. But humanity and warmth is missing from the lives of the Kittredges and their set.

John Guare's children are based , it seems, on real life people. How lucky for Guare to have found the great Fred Schepsi as their perfect foster father. Will Smith plays a man without identity, choosing one for himself, with such care, with such gusto that everyone remains enthralled, first of all us, the audience. Stockard Channing's Ouisa discovers a new side to her own self in front of our eyes. It is a performance of guts and beauty. Donald Sutherland's Flan is a first for the movies, we've never met a character like him on the screen. The scene in which he listens to Will Smith's Paul explain his thesis is a triumph. We see Flan falling in love. It is chillingly beautiful. Then, of course, the aforementioned Will Smith, he moves with a borrowed self confidence, like his character and it's impossible not to love him. He has the elegance of a Cary Grant and the charisma that we all now associate with Will Smith. I only regret that he didn't go for the kiss. That would have completed the shocking sum of all his parts. I love this film. I love John Guare for writing it. I love Schepsi (he's an old love of mine ""Cry in Dark"" ""Plenty"") The superb editing, the wonderful tangoish score and the work of the production and costume designers makes ""Six Degrees of Separation"" one of the most rewarding movie experiences.

The movie title refers to the theory that, taken 2 people at random from the globe, be it the Pope and yourself, an eskimo and the President of the United States, there can be at most 6 people separating them. Therefore the trick of getting in contact with any person can be reduced to the finding of 6 people. In practice, Will Smith gets particularly lucky, as only one person will be needed to accomplish his task, of stepping into the world of the rich bourgeois New York society. In particular, the life of a family of art merchants (Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing) is literally swept by his arrival, which opens a crack in their life and start making them reflect about their own existence.The movie is witty, amusing, passionate, rich in surprises and in elements of interest, as it addresses the problem of existence (how much of it you can account for), the role of fantasy and imagination and the relationship between parents and children.

Please don't tell me that this is exactly the point and how their roles were meant to be played. Only the worst director in the world could have looked at their group scenes and said, ""now that really sizzled."" I am positive that every actor in this film (some of whom are truly gifted performers) other than Stockard Channing, (who---let's face it---has been a lot better than this)--probably cringe when they watch themselves in this. This is the only timeI have ever seen Donald Sutherland in, where he is grating and annoying. Bruce Davidson is much better than this and seems to be phoning it in. And Will Smith is NOT a revelation in this film, no matter how much people wanted him to be. He is more of a charming speech giver than someone truly invested in hischaracter.

53,JaniceNicole,Fails to keep your attention,5,30 January 2012,"""Six Degrees of Separation"" is about a rich fifth avenue couple, the Kittredge's, who are conned by a young black man one night and spend the next few weeks finding out as much as they can about this boy. They go around telling the story to everyone they come across and find friends who went through the same experience days before. The movie is very slow moving, with many of the important scenes carried out through endless dialogue and very little else going on. Originally being a stage piece, the heavy dialogue is to be expected; however, the adaptation to screen leaves you wanting a little more. In spite of it's flaws, ""Six Degrees of Separation"" gives an interesting insight on how superficial lives can be and how we sometimes take what we have for granted.",Six Degrees of Separation
54,nitramd2000,i was intrigued by this film,8,17 October 2012,"i voted this film very highly, an 8 to be exact. i might be the only one that thought Will Smith did a fine job within this movie. His character rehearsed his lines, therefore sounding rehearsed. So that robotic argument is virtually out the window, considering that's what his character was to be and sound like. Did anyone write about the possibility of Paul having any mental illness? It seems like people missed that the character of ""Paul"" needed mental help and that is one main reason louisa or oisa or whatever her name was felt for the kid. She was also impressed with his ability to learn so much and be able to change his way of speech and become so articulate in a matter of just 3 months. Personally, i cant think of a movie i've seen where i thought Donald Sutherland ever did a bad job either. I will agree with one thing though, the acting of the ""kids"" of each family was god awful.",Six Degrees of Separation
55,Baby Bunny,"Thank you, Will!",8,14 February 2000,"Watch this terrific movie if only to see Will Smith actually ACT!

56,ROBERT_BLUE,"The Con, The Greed, The Homosexuality",9,6 September 2007,"Every once and awhile, seemingly always at the oddest of times, I finally sit down to watch one of those films that everyone's heard of, but no one has seen. And every once and awhile I find a film that stirs my passion for storytelling.Six Degrees of Separation will most likely never be understood, as the themes and allusions are often colored and complex. Even this writer doesn't begin to fully understand everything Guare is trying to say. It is however, quite disappointing, that in all of the internet chatter Google may churn out, the themes of homosexuality are ignored as if they have absolutely no bearing on the story. They are as vital a part of the story as is Louisa's breakdown scene, and Flan's realization that he does actually love Paul.So, when you're at the video store, bored with the drivel Hollywood pukes out these days, pick this film up. Pay close attention to the cracks that begin to form in the characters, and run your fingers along those cracks to the end, and you may find yourself caught up in a story with a star shaped meaning. But be careful, it is the type of story that may have you looking inside yourself and who you're connected to.",Six Degrees of Separation
57,mrsovicdarko,"Good storytelling, bad story",6,17 August 2015,"Movie starts as an interesting story. I thought that Pol will rob rich people, and that is why he trained so much. I hoped that he would do some great deceit. but no, as the movie goes along, it become clear that behind it is a story not worth telling. Poor gay guy who only wants to enjoy rich people company, not cool. especially because those rich people are full of them, and not care about lower class, and doing everything not to become. Ending is too poor. Some would say that it leaves it to imagination, but I say that it lacks imagination. 6 stars only because it has great actors that did fine job, and story at first that got me curious. On the second hand, maybe I should put 5 stars, too bad for grades in between, 5,5 is the correct answer.

Then he goes to this couple's house and cooks them dinner and they all have a nice talk about art and books. Ian McClellan is there and he is trying to be South African but knows his accent is bad so doesn't say much. Then it is morning and the woman finds the nice guy bumming a stranger in the bedroom. Then everyone flips out and Donald Sutherland picks up all his trinkets.Then the next hour of the film is the couple telling a story. They tell the story to the kids who are SEETHING about them giving away the pink shirt which was for his new body.So then the newspaper says that the first guy, the nice guy, bummed some other guy and took his money after they danced in the rainbow room which is so unfair because he was just being nice as usual and likes a nice bumming. Then after a few more cocktail parties and stories the nice guy calls up ""Weezer"" the lady and says, you are my father do you want me to make you dinner again then they get stuck in traffic and Donald Sutherland cares about the nice guy when they see him get arrested but then he doesn't care anymore because really he is heartless and just wants to sell art to foreigners who don't even want to buy the art and just want to hear about the nice boy. Then Weezer is upset because she can't find the nice guy because he is a liar and is schizophrenic and he has hanged himself (probably) with the pink shirt in a prison but she is not family.

The message of the movie is the danger of living life as a series of anecdotes or cocktail stories. Under that main current swirls several eddies of secondary observations on the human experience, including how we are connected to each other, how we often fool ourselves, and how it is easier to distract ourselves with 'situations' and 'events' of life, rather than engage ourselves in 'living' life.",Six Degrees of Separation
64,jpoulter11,Overlooked and thoughtful examination of many salient barriers,10,19 January 2011,"A fantastic script bolstered by excellent performances, pleasant visuals, and steady directing. Once 'Six Degrees' truly gains momentum and once the characters become fleshed out (usually aided by the insertion of complementary characters), the issues tackled in the film start to weigh heavily.There are so many worthwhile concepts at play here, particularly the latent desire for those separated by a societal barrier (race, class, age, etc.) to reconcile and to look more closely at one another.The ending was fantastic; it may be frustrating to some viewers given its ambiguity, but that's what I loved about it. The events that occurred in the film would not be done any justice by neatly wrapping them up at the conclusion. There are too many disparate forces and influences on the characters, especially Ouisa. The important thing, however, is how she embraces her new experiences and allows them to challenge her and contemplate if her life is how she wants it to be.Highly, highly recommended.",Six Degrees of Separation

He played a blue collar homosexual conman who invaded but possibly enriched the lives of isolated upper class fools, while pretending to be the son of Sidney Poitier.  As his deception unravelled, the effect of his entrance into their lives deeply affected those involved, marvellously played by Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland. The film was expertly acted and directed, though as often is the case with play-to-film adaptions it did seem like a filmed play.

""to be or not to be"", well william had it all. who are you? what are you going to do with your life? to what extent do you actually exist without other people? how free are you? are you only what you had been doing as time passed by with you incessantly planning things, or are you what your heart tells you to be? life is the time that passes as you keep planning things, as lennon says, and how exactly does that apply to you? the picture has two sides, yes, and in this system, this cage,whatever you wish to call it, this invisibly internalized system whose grip on us gets stronger day by day has soaked into our individual lives so much that we have turned into blank sheets who have become what we are told we have to be. we, then, completely forget about what we have been, what we were. and so life becomes a series of blind-fights you put up with anyone, even with a random guy on the street whose name you don't even know, at whose face you don't even look. cause you have to stand straight and face forward. all those things that we do to fake it. to fake that we are lonely sons of bitches who play in their own comedies without ever knowing it's a comedy.. and then the strangest guy intrudes your life and sings you back what you had denied: your real self. people are so different and yet so alike. think of maslow's pyramid. and they are so scared and they are made so lonely by constructs and schemata that they are so keen on surviving as to refuse the most sincere kind of connection with other souls cause, damn, it is so hard to believe people. so what do you do? you start wearing a mask and it gradually becomes your face..like the way it was with the theater kids in the movie. and you fake it. you fake it just to get recognition and approval, whatever. just to belong. to be loved. and you repeat this with every one. you turn into a sick person, the normal person, with only one side of the picture. well, the movie not only makes quite clever references to *spoiler*--salinger's the catcher in the rye but the whole movie is based on the book's theme--*spoiler*.. what is it that makes you hold on? well, i guess it is time that we look for the threads...like those placenta like aura kind of things that donnie(darko) saw.

71,enshroudedconvolutedenig,My View on six degrees(spoilers),10,13 September 2006,"I Love this movie; There is so much more to it than meets the eye and when looking into the depths of the movie you so the intricate dance of subtleties that (in my opinion) make this movie joy to watch. This movie shows both the peoples capacity for kindness, but also our gullibility to kindness. We see the relationship between the ""higher society"" parents of today, who are far out of touch with their children, and their children. The subtle representation in this movie is seen throughout the movie and show's many of the different things brought up in the movie.The kindness of strangers reflects throughout the movie, it makes the movie progress. Each family brings him in and helps him out with only his word that he is a friend of their kids. They put him up in their house (and two of them trusted him enough to leave him alone) given only their child's name. Although focusing on the rich it even show's the poorer kindness with Rick and Elizabeth, who take him in with barely enough means to get by themselves. Ouisa shows a giant capacity for kindness when she stands up for Paul's memory at the diner party declaring ""it was an experience, I will not let him become an anecdote, oh that reminds me about the time that impostor came into our lives, tell me the one about the boy"" and again when she agree's to take him into the station so he is not treated poorly.The converse of their kindness we also see the representation of the rich peoples relationship with their children. The Kittridges give away their sons ""favorite"" pink shirt to Paul, and have no idea comment on their daughters ""I'm moving to Afghanistan"" cry for attention. You can see that it is a cry for attention when Tess is on the phone and says ""I'm moving to Afghanistan, I'm throwing away everything..."" and hangs up. Larkin is not even concerned with the happenings of his child's life ""I don't want to know, I don't want to know"" and would rather stay oblivious to it. The group of parents and their children are together when the kids erupt with rantings against their parents ""you don't understand, you gave him my pink shirt"" etc but they are more entirely concerned with Paul.The distance in the parent to child relationship is one of the many things shown in the subtle representation frequent throughout the movie. ""The Candinsky's painted on both sides"" The double sided painting represents life, there's two sides to everything. The painting can represent the movie, the chaos representing the chaos of those trying to find Paul and control being the control Paul shows sneaking in and out of their lives. ""Collage is the art form of the twentieth century- everything is somebody else's"" again represents life, but rather todays life opposed to a general statement about life itself. everyone is taking parts of everything else and just claiming their own. We no longer have ""a genius on every corner"" (Goeffery) but rather we just have ""a rainy night in Boston"" where everything is put together. This movie itself is a collage of ideas embedded into each other and given flow.",Six Degrees of Separation

I think it'll keep us on the edge of our seats. Will Smith is a very good actor for being his age so we would definitely enjoy watching him act in this movie. Critics say that Will Smith was a phenomenal actor in Six Degrees of Separation and really played a big role in transforming the play into a great film, keeping the audience at the edge of their seats.

Flan and Ouisa are entrenched in their own rich and extraordinarily sheltered world of art dealing, until a young man barges into their lives. This movie, though it does slow down in parts, is certainly worth the time. It forces us to rethink the lives we lead, and how we are inextricably intertwined with everyone else on the planet--whether or not that fact is convenient. Paul, the intruder, dazzles Flan and Ouisa with his outgoing personality, cooking skills, and in-depth knowledge of Catcher in the Rye (a PERFECT novel for Paul to admire). As the plot unfolds and more of Paul's history is revealed, the viewer will certainly become mildly uncomfortable. It's worth it, though.

I recall that only one of us was actually able to appreciate any of it. Perhaps we were all just too immature to understand the complexity of this film but upon watching it again I can hardly see how critics can adore this train wreck.I cannot relate to any of the characters and I doubt I could empathize with any of them if by some cruel twist of fate I was one. Ouisa is an unrealistic combination of random emotions and childish ideas. Her line ""Chaos...Control...Chaos...Control...You like?...You like?"" is one of many that just drove me and my peers to hating her. Flan and his ridiculous obsession with his Kandinsky painting and his stale, generally uninteresting personality is yet another prime example of bad characters making bad films.Will Smith, was perhaps this films only saving grace as I have enjoyed some of his other, more entertaining films. Unfortunately his unnecessary unexplained ending along with his lack of a MIB tuxedo or awesome alien adversaries meant that he was no better a character than any one else in the film.We watched this film for our topic of journeys and there is no literal sense of journey therefore every ounce of journey had to be inferred, ""read between the lines"" so to speak.Six degrees of separation is a bad movie.

This is the beginning of a magical evening, which in turn makes Ouisa search for the meaning in her life. Many reviews complained about the chaotic feel of the movie, but the chaos actually symbolizes the lack of direction in Ouisa's life, or as she says it herself: ""There is plenty of color in my life, but I'm not aware of any structure"". More generally, this movie directs all of us to be more conscious and try to look for who we really are.All in all I think this is one of the best movies of the twentieth century and it should be a real waste if you'd decide not to watch it due to its 'low' mark on IMDb ;).",Six Degrees of Separation

I'd heard about the movie for years, and thought it was based on a true story of an impostor claiming to be Sidney Portier's son. My husband knew Will's character was gay; I didn't know and didn't care. The move was wonderful. Is is based on an actual person? Or had I imagined such a person years ago when the movie first was released? Some people may think Will is gay. Such is the power of his acting skills, the writer, casting director, and directors.

He was able to get in and befriend the high society world that he so admired. I saw the actually show myself and even I was impressed as hell with him. The difference is that the real-life person grew up in a well to do very privilege home himself. I wish the movie reflected more of that.
