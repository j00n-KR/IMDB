0,SnoopyStyle,sci-fi noir,5,25 August 2021,"In the near-future, Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) lives in a flooded Miami due to climate change. He and his assistant Emily 'Watts' Sanders (Thandiwe Newton) operate a machine for people to relive their best memories. Both are veterans of a devastating recent war. Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) walks in asking for help to find her keys and begins a relationship with Nick. She goes missing and Nick becomes haunted reliving his memories with her over and over again. The police hires him to get into a comatose suspect's memories where he discovers Mae working as a nightclub waitress. He starts investigating on his own and dives into a rabbit hole of mysteries.There is a lot to like in this near-future sci-fi noir. I like the style of it. I like Hugh Jackman. I like the idea of this concept but the concept actually imbeds a devious story landmine. It forces a lot of the action into flashbacks. The narrative becomes a labyrinthian mess. It strives for something interesting but fails to grasp it. Writer/director Lisa Joy seems to be trying to branch out on her own after her work on Westworld. She has something there but it needs work. The first thing I would work on is the title. It's trying to be Nolanesque without the self-confidence.",Reminiscence
1,boblipton,Stuffing A Decent Mystery Into Film Noir Technique Just Because,5,4 September 2021,"A decade or so in the future, in a half-drowned Miami, Hugh Jackman and Thandiwe Newton run a business dredging up old memories from people. While they work fr the court system for futuristic depositions, most of their customers are people seeking happiness and comfort in the past. One shift, as they are about to close, Rebecca Ferguson bounces in, wanting to know where she left her keys. Jackman is captivated and they soon begin an affair. But then she disappears, and Jackman pursues her trail, leading into a welter of corruption.Every trick of film nor, from odd angles, to filtered lighting, to voice-over, to flashbacks, through societal corruption is used in this sci-fi story. And as it went through a bag of tricks more filled than that of Felix the Cat, I became convinced that it was all style and no substance, things done because the audience would go ooh and ah and never think about why they would do things that way. Ok, so global warming causes the waters to rise and start to slop over Florida, so they build these gigantic sea walls costing tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, and continue to occupy the upper floors of buildings..... instead of moving to higher ground? We also get to see New Orleans -- already below sea level -- in the same condition. Well, bad guys gotta do bad things, I suppose, even if there's no reason, noir protagonists gotta do voice overs, femmes gotta fatale, and so forth.Nicely tangled plot, but it's all as wired as the front of Miss Ferguson's strapless evening gown.",Reminiscence
2,Prismark10,Reminiscence,5,24 August 2021,"Lisa Joy is the sister in law of Christopher Nolan and wife of writer Jonathan Nolan.Reminiscence has some reminders of Memento. A man trying to piece together his past.Set in the near future where Miami has been half flooded with the richer folks living on the dryer part of the city.Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) is a war veteran turned private investigator. Along with his assistant Watts (Thandie Newton) they have special equipment to draw out their client's memories or relive favourite moments.One day lounge singer Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) walks in wanting to find her lost keys. Bannister is enchanted by her and they begin an affair. Watts distrusts her.Mae soon disappears and Bannister searches for her. Worse he has been reliving the memories of Mae.Soon discovers that Mae might have targeted Bannister, she was after something on behalf of a wealthy family. It leads Bannister to a murder plot and a child in danger.Despite the futuristic settings which has some nods to Waterworld. This is a film noir at his heart. The voice over narration brings to mind Blade Runner.Reminiscence has too much baggage. The movie itself is flat and lifeless. Some of the action scenes are lazy. The CGI of a half flooded Miami is well done though.",Reminiscence
3,nogodnomasters,Faulter States,4,27 August 2021,The film takes place in the future with the streets of Miami under water and boats are used to navigate the city which is in chaos. Nick (Hugh Jackman) operates a memory machine where people can relive their glory days. Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) comes in and wants to find her lost keys. The two become an item and Nick falls in love and Mae leaves town. Nick wants to find her while everyone knows he was played.The film tries to do too much with both the setting and the plot. The main fault of the production is half the time people see themselves in their memories and the other half is a more proper first person view of the events. There was zero consistency or explanation. The movie was too boring and needed to be cut.Guide: Brief sex scene. No nudity. No swearing as I recall.,Reminiscence
4,kosmasp,Science Fiction Fairy tale,7,26 August 2021,"Any movie that might bring anyone to read on certain things ... is good in my book. And while I assume that some watching this, may not have heard of Orpheus story ... they hopefully will look it up.Having said that, I understand that for some Hugh Jackman may look like he's not fully involved in here at times. But the fact this feels like a Science Fiction noir ... well that really tingled me quite a lot. Also the overall casting is amazing. Daniel Wu may only be a bit player here, but his charisma and coolness oozes of the screen.Add to that a wonderful cinematography and you could do far worse here. The story may be predictable to a degree and certain things may not make too much sense, but there is a philosophical note here ... and an ending that is the best possible I assume ... but you may judge differently.",Reminiscence
5,Sleepin_Dragon,All endings are sad....,6,28 August 2021,"...apart from the eventual moment where credits rolled, it's a decent watch, it just felt too long at times, and a bit repetitive.It's an interesting film, it's almost like a sci fi film noir, it has that moody, subdued atmosphere, and the appropriate dialogue, the contradiction comes with the water logged Cities and imaginative technology, an interesting contrast of styles.The trailers looked great, the film looks fantastic, but for me there was too much of a focus on the visuals, and not enough on the actual storytelling, which at times was a little drab. Visually though it's amazing, the futuristic world looks awesome, throw in Rebecca Ferguson's gorgeous presence and Jackman's muscles, and you have something for everyone.Imaginative, interesting, just a little too slow for me, it felt like a film hampered by restrictions, which of course it was. 6/10.",Reminiscence
6,classicsoncall,"""It started as a con, but by the end it was something real.""",7,17 September 2021,"The science here is somewhat suspect, but I guess that's why the word 'fiction' is attached to the genre. You might also include the word 'fantasy' because a number of things just didn't add up. I can sort of go along with the idea of memories being reproduced as holographic images, but when Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) inserted himself into one with Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) by replacing Boothe (Cliff Curtis), that was taking things a bit too far. But overall, I did like the twists and turns in this little story of love and revenge. That it didn't end happily ever after was okay by me; not all stories have to have a satisfying conclusion. I just have to wonder though, why a guy like Nick would relegate himself to a future of living with his past memories over a relationship gone wrong. Retreating into one's nostalgic memories has it's place, but can never be a substitute for moving forward in life.",Reminiscence
7,paul_haakonsen,Quite entertaining mystery thriller...,6,19 September 2021,"When I sat down to watch ""Reminiscence"" from writer and director Lisa Joy I hadn't even heard about the movie. But it being a new movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to sit down and watch it. And it having the likes of Hugh Jackman, Cliff Curtis and Daniel Wu on the cast list, just sweetened the deal.And I will say that writer and director Lisa Joy definitely managed to compose a storyline that was every bit as interesting as it was entertaining. And I was more than adequately entertained by the movie, especially since it wasn't a predictable plot, and there were some fairly interesting changes to the storyline along the way to throw off the audience. The storyline here is well-written and nicely paced, which makes for a good movie experience.The cast that appeared in the movie were nicely cast and definitely portrayed their roles and characters well, which added to the overall feel of the movie.If you enjoy a thriller mystery that doesn't lead you down a predictable path, then ""Reminiscence"" is a movie you should take the time to sit down and watch.Visually then ""Reminiscence"" was nice. The CGI department made the movie look very atmospheric and realistic, which added a lot of depth - pardon the pun - to the movie.My rating of ""Reminiscence"" lands on a well-deserved six out of ten stars.",Reminiscence
8,Quinoa1984,"Not original, but it certainly is a lot of talent and energy for a film that doesn't know it's silly",6,20 August 2021,"This is one of those times my star rating shouldn't necessarily reflect the entire quality of the film in question. I enjoyed more than a few parts of Reminiscence, less because of actual satisfaction with the material or performances and more because it is not very good but is completely enjoyable despite all that.This is such a sincere, clichéd, ambitious and silly piece of total pulp taken from not only Film Noir but from I may venture to assume Noir comics (like Sin City if it got tossed into the hands of a grad student working on a dissertation on recognizable but still science fiction hellscapes) and put into a pot roast where Hugh Jackman looks intense and sad and angry for two hours, Thandie Newton perfects concerned and/or consternation while occasionally (kind of inexplicably to me) turning total bad-ass assassin, and Rebecca Ferguson as one of the most attractive yet totally cold Femme Fatales this side of the ghost of Gene Tierny.The dialog is so striving for the poetical it becomes hilarious and the concepts thrown in regarding the world around this memory-videography system where it's dystopia but there's also been a war and there's the Haves and Have Nots and zzzz but not much is done with it except there needs to be cool and seemingly deep ideas about society in turmoil as the backdrop. And when it's time for an action scene or fight to break out, the filmmaler Lisa Joy is much less compelled by realism than the thrill of seeing two guys tumble into a music room and you betcha the piano will get some use despite it making so little sense (again, looks cool how it floats down into the performance area).Same thing as, and I credit my wife with pointing this out post screening, how Jackman's Nick mentions in one of his lugubrious narrations that Miami at night is when everything comes alive because it's too hot out in the day... but he still goes out in the day time sometimes, plus New Orleans which is also the deep south and turned over by climate change disaster, and he dons a full suit and tie and trenchcoat because God forbid he look like something outside of what Mitchum or Bogart perfected so long ago.I could go on listing the sheer nonsense on tap in Reminiscence, but that wouldn't make for a particularly compelling review. No, if you think a much dumber yet still wildly watchable film that clearly is the off kilter (yet sadly sometimes still boring) love child of Dark City and Inception (and naturally this is by Nolan's sister in law, not to put her down for that, good for her to get an original screenplay made, especially one that swings so hard as this one), then go for it. Reminiscence is too long, too full of its own science fiction grandeur to take very seriously, and all the actors - I neglected to mention Cliff Curtis in a memorable snarly villain role with a great-terrible burn mark on his head- are bringing it 11000% and I am always grateful when people aren't phoning it in. And... can someone explain what the ending is all about? I mean I get it, but... why?",Reminiscence
9,CinemaSerf,A hollow-graphic experience.,6,15 September 2021,"The problem with this is you haven't the faintest idea as to what the thing is about until so late in the day as to have long since even up... Hugh Jackman (""Nick"") runs a sort of laboratory with his pal Thandie Newton (""Watts"") that has a big bath into which folks can go an relive their memories for a few hundred bucks a pop. One day, the beautiful ""Mae"" (Rebecca Ferguson) arrives, into the bath she gets and poor old ""Nick"" is hooked... From here on in it's not quite clear whether we are in the past, the present or the future - was she real, is she real - is he, is any of it - and most importantly - do we give a monkeys? Sadly, his obsession wasn't mine - and I lost interest. There are some fun scenes - especially for fans of lethal fish, but for the most part it is a good looking but rather uninteresting story that gives us precious little context at any stage that might enable us to opt into his fixation. Nobody's best work.",Reminiscence
10,oscaralbert,TITANIC is the only previous Neo-Noir film to feature a grand piano sinking . . .,10,31 August 2021,". . . at least 40 feet into deadly waters. However, though private eye hero Nick seems down for the count just as much as TITANIC's Jack, his warmer and more shallow imminent watery grave of a flooded Miami theater allows him to resurrect himself for a far sadder and more poignant ultimate fate than pretty boy Jack's (who never had to tussle with Cal within the wreckage of ANY musical instrument!). Femme Fatale Mae proves to be a much better singer than that raft hog Rose, and Mae's haunting renditions of Rodgers and Hart's ""Where or When"" will leave empathetic viewers with an earworm as persistent as a toothache. Clocking in at about half TITANIC's running time, REMINISCENCE is far more visually stunning than its over-rated bladder-busting predecessor. While the lack of a crass PR campaign will prevent this current release from winning any Best Picture Oscar, its flooded Miami tops a flooded boat any day of the week. Though the plots of both epics center around the fate of bits of costume jewelry, the briefer REMINISCENCE's echoes of futuristic BLADE RUNNER totally obliterate any ""innovations"" bloated TITANIC's over-used storyline elicits. Toss in Watt's role as Nick's neglected guardian angel and Cyrus as a far better (DICK TRACY worthy) villain than Cal, and you may wish to join Nick in reliving the valiant Mae forever.",Reminiscence
11,bombersflyup,Put me to sleep this one.,1,22 August 2021,"Reminiscence has no entertainment and no purpose.How a film starring Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson can be so dull, I dunno. Thandiwe Newton's just annoying, why cast her? Poor characters and writing, PC junk as well, meh.",Reminiscence
12,thesar-2,Total Reminiscence,4,22 August 2021,"Not sure which I preferred more: the original Waterworld, or this prequel.Just kidding. This isn't a prequel, but rather a sorta-sequel to movies I'd much rather see.Throughout this futuristic film noir, we hear countless of interesting ideas. Wars, Global Warming's destruction and land disputes/politics. All of which sounded MUCH more exciting.To be fair, this movie looks gorgeous and I still have yet to see a bad Rebecca Ferguson performance, though, I would probably rank this one my least favorite. And in a movie I'll never see again.Thanks to our stupidity, the oceans have reclaimed much of the lands. Wars broke out, dry lands seized, many millions displaced and temperatures get so hot we all became nocturnal. But, forget all that. Our story here involves a love triangle involving a man so obsessed with a dame, he nearly loses his mind and his memory-replay business. When the dame disappears, he uses his machine that helps people relive their memories to figure out what happened to her.The rest of the story is the old-fashioned crime mystery with hours of exposition. I understand why it's used here, but I'd much rather figure things out for myself. I've always believed in: Show, Don't Tell.It was okay. Glad it was available at home because I most certainly would've fallen asleep in the theatre with nothing else to distract me. But it was nice to see two of my favorite actresses from the Mission: Impossible franchise together in one movie.***Final Thoughts: I do feel sorry for people who have children and they'll have to live with the consequences coming from our current stupidity. Hopefully, they'll come up with some creative ways to combat the new Earth after Global Warming continues. Not sure why people won't just move more inland. This movie brushed right over that - again, there were many more movies I would've rather seen in this film's universe.",Reminiscence
13,FeastMode,poor execution of decent subject matter,4,29 October 2021,"This movie isn't horrible. But it's definitely not good either. And i can't figure out what could have made it better. It's a cool idea that doesn't result in a.... memorable movie (lol i'm stupid).It looks good. The performances are great. Some of the editing seemed off. And i wasn't emotionally invested in the story. It's mostly fine with some stuff i disliked (1 viewing, 10/28/2021)",Reminiscence
14,Cineanalyst,"""Ever hear of Orpheus and Eurydice?""",8,20 August 2021,"Yes, Hugh Jackman, I have heard of Orpheus and Eurydice, and you, dear reader, have too if you've read my reviews for ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" (2019) and the ""John Wick"" series (2014, 2017, 2019, thus far), or otherwise are familiar with one of the greatest Ancient Greek myths. I'm going to have to start tracking references to this tragedy if it continues to pop up in cinema so frequently. Looking back, it's making me thankful I took a college class on Greek mythology and film; it's coming in handy. We watched ""Black Orpheus"" (1959) for the cinematic adaptation, by the way. For my taste, ""Reminiscence"" is too blunt with the references--the scene from which the headline quotation is taken is repeated thrice, after all. It does do something reflexively interesting with the myth, though, so that may be forgiven.Additionally, I wonder if there's not an allusion here to another literary source--one that was not only forgotten, but lost, to borrow the picture's parlance, and so it's never explicitly stated, or, perhaps, it's just because I'm nostalgic for those books, too, of Lewis Carroll's Alice stories. To judge by the 42% Rotten Tomatoes score for the title as of this writing, professional entertainment critics don't share such appreciation. They'll harp on the real-world and cinematic references--global warming through ""Blade Runner"" (1982), ""Strange Days"" (1995) and brother-in-law's ""Inception"" (2010)--which is fine; that's there, too. I'd only suggest that one not dismiss this as rehash without considering that's rather the point of it.Jackman's Bannister doesn't create new movies within the movie that is ""Reminiscence;"" he pulls them from memories and replays them over and over again. Most movies are already this, anyways, but tend to conceal rather than acknowledge it. Memories as movies and remembering other people's memories, as well as his own, Bannister is our surrogate spectator within the movie. Thus, we're being asked to bring our own mythological, literary, cinematic and worldly memories to the endeavor. The purpose becomes a matter not of originality, per se, but interpretation. The noir-styled mystery on screen for Bannister and, for us, what all of our memories add up to here--""Blade Runner"" and the rest of the neo-noir sci-fi cannon, ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Orpheus and Eurydice."" With the same understanding, writer-director Lisa Joy and husband Jonathan Nolan's ""Westworld"" series isn't any less one of the few enticing shows on TV because it was already two films (1973 and 1976).The ""Blade Runner"" connection is obvious. They're cyberpunk neon-noirs with extensive voiceover narration, detectives in search of memories, film as surveillance, apparent femme fatales, rain from the skies or from the seas. Indeed, some of the noir storytelling here couldn't be much more generic: the femme fatale here as a nightclub singer that could double for Jessica Rabbit, which itself was already a parody; the clunky voiceover; familial conspiracy involving the city's robber baron. The only thing missing is Humphrey Bogart lighting up cigarettes. With this interpretation, ""Reminiscence"" is more a remembered movie than itself a movie. If ""Blade Runner"" is a look into the eye for humanity, ""Reminiscence"" is likewise through the mind a search for the meaning of remembering, of movies, stories.What's interesting about the sea-levels-rising dystopia is a fear of aging on a global scale. I say this because one of the more intelligible of the usual interpretations of ""Alice in Wonderland,"" as well as its sequel ""Through the Looking-Glass,"" is as a parable for a child's fear of the adult world she will one day join. ""The Matrix"" (1999) already got this as a noir-infused sci-fi dystopia. Nevertheless, it's neat here that, in a sense, one character takes the red pill and the other the blue--one choosing to move forward with life and another to remain in memories of the past. Besides, what else are we to make of the Queen of Hearts so prominently displayed, of the eat-me drugs and the drink-me booze, of Jackman's Alice picking up the White Rabbit of a femme fatale's dropped belongings--the keys in her memory and the ear rings in his--and chasing her down the rabbit hole of a bizarre world of train tracks on top of water and traveling in row boats as if with a Talking Sheep on the way to a burnt Humpty Dumpty, the city collapsing like a house of cards. My favorite Alice allusion here is the shop of clocks, a motif from the books as much as the use of mirrors here. Note the only mad character in the movie is trapped here in a loop with hordes of doubles in hats; it's the picture's mad tea party.As for the Greek mythology, ""Orpheus and Eurydice"" is so compatible with cinema because that narrative, too, is about the gaze and resurrection--a legend anticipating an invention to be millennia in the future. An underworld that is literally under water, where a man is set on fire for the rest of his existence. How apt, then, that this Orpheus and Eurydice gaze through the art form of motion pictures--the older model of memory tub here even projects the remembrances in widescreen format upon a screen, as well as in black and white for further nostalgia. Kind of interesting, too, that the Jesus figure here, the walking-on-water Saint Jiu, turns out to be a false prophet. Movies are our memories of the dead. Humphrey Bogart, Rutger Hauer--they're gone except when we replay ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), say, or ""Blade Runner."" So is Alice Liddell, for that matter, but there's John Tenniel's drawings of her caricature in the Alice books, just as with the other people's memories drawn in Bannister's book here. Bannister as filmmaker and spectator, just as with martial arts in art galleries with the ""John Wick"" franchise, painting in ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire, carnival in ""Black Orpheus,"" and Orpheus, too, was a musician (and in a visually splendid picture, I especially love the sinking piano), poet and prophet. As with Orpheus, as with Bannister, as with the film spectator, looking back entails recalling someone or something that no longer exists; it's always a kind of death, and it's always the ending.",Reminiscence
15,A_Different_Drummer,watta waste,6,1 November 2021,All the pop-flies and near-misses from the Nolan family -- even if by proxy -- tend to be technically perfect with the best A-list actors. Now THAT is irony.,Reminiscence

Anyway I really enjoyed the bulk of the movie I didn't hate it except overtime dragged on a little to much. The cinematography, Sci-Fi aspects, writing, and story were all superb especially the cinematography/scenery! Some complained about the CGI but I think it was pretty solid I do think Lisa Joy is a lot better with WestWorld that show is masterful!

18,Thanos_Alfie,Not good...,5,6 November 2021,"""Reminiscence"" is a Mystery - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a private investigator of the mind in the future trying to find a missing woman who is a former client of his. He starts investigating her disappearance in order to find the truth behind it.I have to admit that I had expectations from this movie and I was disappointed by it since it had a simple but boring plot. The direction which was made by Lisa Joy who is also the writer of it, did not succeed on making us understand neither the concept of the movie nor to relate to her main characters. The interpretations of both Hugh Jackman who played as Nick Bannister and Rebecca Ferguson who played as Mae were good but they could not save the movie. Lastly, I have to say that ""Reminiscence"" is another mystery movie that failed to create the atmosphere to support it so, I do not recommend it to anyone because I am sure that you can find far better mystery movies than this one.",Reminiscence
19,cruise01,Sci fi mind bending film that gets lost with whats it trying to be.,5,21 August 2021,"2.5 out of 5 stars.Reminiscense is a pretty bad science fiction thriller film that tries so much to be everything else and even throw a few other sci fi movie ideas. But it is terribly put together in this film. It tries to be a neo noir crime solving thriller, love story, mind bending, and post apocalyptic with the world being over taken by the sea. Does any of it work? Not really. It just becomes one dull thriller with Nick (Hugh Jackman) revisiting memories. Trying to put pieces together while searching for his ex Mae (Rebecca Ferguson). And is obsessed with his past. Revisiting for nostalgia. And trying to solve her disappearance. While opening up a conspiracy that involves him going on a goose chase.Plot is flat. It can be confusing. It all comes together when the film puts everything together in the end. There are twists and turns. Is it surprising or satisfying? No. The build up leads to absolutely nothing exciting at all. You will be left rather disappointed.Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson did okay with there roles. Even Thandie Newton. The movie is wasted with a boring script and dull direction. The concept of the world being overtaken by sea level was interesting. And a big war that changed everything being briefly mentioned in the narrative was all set in the side line. The film is a bit mixed with Inception and Blade Runner. But those films were far superior.The music score is boring. Script is wasted with tedious characters and the action is boring. The shoot out sequence in a bar is terribly put together. The visual effects are decent.Writer and director Lisa Joy first film adaptation is a disappointment. Such a shame cause her work on Westworld is amazing. And seeing this film felt like a chore to see what would happen next with its mysterious plot. It does lead to a disappointment.",Reminiscence
20,zkonedog,Noir Aesthetic May Not Be For Everyone,5,30 August 2021,"When I first began hearing about ""Reminiscence"", my interest almost could not have been higher. Director Lisa Joy co-creates the TV series ""Westworld"" with husband Jonathan Nolan (himself a film/TV writing star), and the concept of nostalgia or going through old memories seemed an utterly fascinating one. As such, I was as excited to be in a theater seat on opening weekend for this one as any film in the past year or so.But then, a rather strange thing happened: ""Reminiscence"" turned out to be an extremely different film than I ever could have expected. To be honest, I'm still a bit unsure (hence the down-the-middle 5 star ranking) as to its objective quality, seeing as it how was such a departure from what I had in mind going on.For a very basic overview, ""Reminiscence"" tells the story of Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman), a man who has created a machine allowing one to go back and viscerally experience memories from earlier points in life. Along with partner Watts (Thandiwe Newton), the duo eek out a living in a flooded, pre-apocalyptic Miami, charging for each ""reminiscence"". Just before closing time one night, however, the beautiful and mysterious Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) walks in wanting to find a lost set of keys. What results from that seemingly simple request is an ever-deepening rabbit hole for both Nick & Mae.The strangest thing about ""Reminiscence"", at least to me, is that is isn't particularly a plot-driven movie. Nor is it even necessarily character-driven in the traditional sense. It doesn't directly dive into the mechanisms behind the memory experiences, it keeps the sci-fi angles at an arm's length, and there is not a single/central mystery to solve. All those elements are present in some capacity, but not ""the thing"" that is focused on.No, the calling card of ""Reminiscence"" is its clearly enunciated desire (through every piece of cinematography and character performance) to be a piece of film noir. That aesthetic is all over the entire process. The closest comp I can give the movie is ""Blade Runner"", in terms of the crusty/gritty characters, the bleak setting, and the central conceit that never seems to be the main focus. From the costumes to the props and even some of the other filmmaking choices (like a recurring voice-over), this is noir through and through.Very subjectively, I am not a huge fan of film noir. As such, I was surprised (and truth be told, a bit disappointed) that ""Reminiscence"" took such an approach. My experience watching the film was certainly dimmed because of it. For simply comparison's sake, this is a far different style of filmmaking than the approach taken by her husband and brother-in-law, to be sure.At this point, then, I'm kind of giving ""Reminiscence"" an ""incomplete"" grade. I very much need to see it again now that I know what type of film it is. Perhaps that will produce a higher opinion.

21,eddie_baggins,Overflowing with many half-explored ideas,5,3 September 2021,"One of the most glaring examples of an ""almost"" film I can recall seeing, poor old Reminiscence at times comes mightily close to providing us with something special and wondrously inventive but more often than not squander's it chances to become a film that is intriguing in parts but quickly moves towards a picturesque failure rather than an original winner.Transitioning from her work on the hit HBO series Westworld and marking her feature debut as a director, Lisa Joy has found very little of her namesake with Reminiscence's recent release around the world on the hybrid same day streaming/cinema format that has seen her Hugh Jackman starring sci-fi infused romantic thriller sink badly at the global box office in what will go down as one of 2021's most disastrous performance's from a financial point of view.Garnering a slew of fairly mediocre reviews with but a handful of critics willing to overlook the films failings for the good it sometimes manages to deliver, Reminiscence feels like a poor man's hybrid of Inception and call's to mind the grand vision of a now revered film such as Dark City as we follow Hugh Jackman's army man turned memory investigator Nick Bannister through a mysterious case of missing love interest Mae (Jackman's Greatest Showman co-star Rebecca Ferguson) in the not to distant future where the war ravaged world is overcome by rising sea-levels and people's obsession with re-living the past rather than the dreary present.Story wise this concept provides Joy with a great chance to explore some wonderfully realized visual moments and the film is jam-packed with references and insights into a greater world you wish we had been able to explore here but what we are left with outside of the great mix of neo-noir cityscapes and dingy dive bars is a rather so-so story between Bannister and Mae that never becomes a love story or mystery that grips like it could've.There's so much going on here you almost feel as though Joy and her friends at HBO would've been better served had they decided to allow Reminiscence to grow and expand its many concepts in a mini-series or the likes, this may've given room for the foundation of the story to grow, for us to find reasons to care more about Bannister and Mae's dealings and for the mostly hinted at scenarios in this product to become more than something that teases us without every providing a resulting feeling of satisfaction.Final Say -Visually arresting and filled with some fantastic ideas, Reminiscence is sure to find some fans but for the majority, this will be a disappointing experience in the ""almost"" category.2 1/2 fish tanks out of 5.",Reminiscence

But when a seductive woman named Mae(Rebecca Fergeson) comes into Nick's place to see her memories,he becomes infatuated with her. But is she really into Nick or is she working for someone else?.Overall this film is like something Christopher Nolan would direct (Lisa is married to a brother of Chris's so that makes sense). Hugh Jackman was good in this film but I think he was miscast as I think the likes of George Clooney or even Bradley Cooper might be better as Nick.

Miami is now completely submersed into ocean water. We are introduced to Nick, who has a machine that allows people to revisit past memories (how? Don't ask!). One day, a dame walks in. She is Mae and she has lost her keys, and could Nick help her? Why, of course! At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the directing debut of producer-writer Lisa Joy, best known for her work on the acclaimed HBO series ""Westworld"". Here she comes up with a story line and a setting that immediately feels like we've seen all of this before in one way or another. But that's not the worst of it. I have no idea how this happened, but the acting is just pathetic. Check out the scene where Nick and Mae make out for the first time, I mean, you can practically hear the director yelling ""and... ACTION!"". Or later when Nick, in search of Mae, wonders into a New Orleans bar and gets confronted by Saint Joe and his ilk. It's barely watchable. I can only imagine Hugh Jackson thinking ""how in the world did I end up in this mess?"". How indeed, Mr. Jackson! The movie is billed as a ""neo-noir science fiction thriller"" and ends up being a wanna-be ""neo-noir"" and a wanna-be ""thriller"", but in fact falling short on every level.""Reminiscence"" was released in theaters this past weekend while also streaming on HBO Max (where I caught it). The movie outright bombed, being the worst debut EVER (a pathetic $2 mill) for a film playing in over 3,000 theaters. Yea, no joke. Bottom line: I cannot recommend this film in good conscience to anyone. If course don't take my word for it.

27,jtindahouse,Bland and not as smart as it thinks it is,4,2 September 2021,"The first rule in film is Show, Don't Tell. A reasonably simple rule and one that the majority of films adhere too. Apparently 'Reminiscence' didn't get the memo though. The exposition in this film is bordering on ridiculous. First of all we have narration, and not just set up narration, but constant narration over-top of the majority of scenes. Then there are the cringe-inducing moments where the characters just talk us through everything that is going on. At one point a revelation is being revealed to the audience and Hugh Jackman's character is just summarising it point by point for us. It was embarrassing.The film is so bland. It asks us to care about a mystery of a missing woman. However it completely forgets to make us care about her first. When she disappears you don't feel anything. If anything you're probably relieved she is gone because she was rather annoying.The supporting roles are badly written, like fake imitations of real people. They feel more like Bond villains - just without anything interesting to say. The premise might sound interesting on the surface, but really it just takes away any need for characters to do any digging into the mystery. Why investigate when you can just plug someone in and watch? This movie was a total misfire and one I would certainly not recommend spending your hard-earned on.",Reminiscence

32,kluseba,Imaginative dystopian science-fiction movie with diversified depth,9,17 September 2021,"Reminiscence is a dystopian science-fiction thriller with romantic undertones. The first feature film by Lisa Joy features a very charismatic Hugh Jackman and an intriguingly enigmatic femme fatale played by Rebecca Ferguson.The story revolves around scientist Nick Bannister who has developed a machine that enables people to relive moments from their past. He is assisted by his faithful colleague Emily Watts Sanders who has strong feelings for her boss who is however completely oblivious to them. One day, a mysterious woman named Mae comes into his office and Nick Bannister experiences love at first sight. Mae represents everything he has always been looking for. She is smart, cultivated and charming and they start to develop a tender romantic relationship. From one day to the other however, Mae disappears and leaves Nick broken, confused and worried. He attempts to find out what might have happened to her and soon uncovers a dangerous web of drugs, lies and murder.This movie convinces on numerous levels. First of all, the acting performances are credible and touching. Hugh Jackman is believable as the tough outsider who goes far and beyond to save the love of his life. Thandiwe Newton impresses as faithful colleague with some demons of her own who sees through the lies of the mysterious femme fatale. Rebecca Ferguson delivers the goods as enigmatic woman with multiple layers that are uncovered step by step.Up next, the cinematography of this movie is flawless. The film takes place in a flooded Miami that looks at times depressing but at other moments almost romantic. The machines shown in the film look particularly intriguing. The flashbacks are animated with a nostalgic touch in form of shaded colours and muffled sounds.The story comes around with a few twists and surprises as it keeps the audience guessing until the very end. The movie meanders from dramatic elements over romantic sections to breathtaking action sequences and offers a balanced genre mixture. The ending is quite unexpected and leaves room for discussions and debates.Obviously, this movie isn't perfect. It would have been great to get some background information on the dystopian future. The intriguing locations could have been more present in the film as well.The entire universe is so fascinating that it would perhaps make for an even greater television series than a potential sequel.At the end of the day, anyone who likes dystopian science-fiction cinema should certainly watch this movie at the cinema. This film will appeal as much to those who are looking for a gripping drama as to those who might rather be looking for a film noir with occasional action sequences. This timeless movie has the potential to stand the test of time and become a genre classic. Experience it on screen as soon as you can to get some welcome escapism in difficult times.",Reminiscence

In the near future, coastal cities have been ravaged by flooding & being the pragmatic humans we are; we adapt. Since the populace has taken to remembering the better times, Jackman, who runs a memory recovery business, along w/his partner (a former military running buddy), played by Thandie Newton, is booming.

All of this from writer/director Lisa Joy, wife of Jonathan Nolan (who both created the problematic HBO's Westworld series), who gets her film noir on but borrows too heavily from 1995's Strange Days w/a splash of Blade Runner thrown in but ultimately if it looks too much like something else, maybe a return to the drawing board was needed.

36,rgkarim,"Reminiscing On Detective Days, A Slow Dive Into a Layered Mystery",7,22 August 2021,"LIKES:Feels like a Radio Detective Show;
Reminiscence is a film that I find heavy influences from the radio talk shows that came prior to television. Hearing Jackman's character sort of narrate the adventure, giving feelings, thoughts, and descriptions of the flooded world that is a fun flashback to the audio tales that were normal. Like a good audio book, it helps add a little fun and personality to the movie that brings you into the detective work just a little more.The World Building:
As said in the trailers, the world has become a mess with the melting of ice caps and the destruction of dams, to turn much of the land into a submerged mess. This Waterworld like setting may not be as desolate or expansive as Kevin Costner's precursor, but the flooded zone gets established early on and shows a potential future that could happen. No major floating cities, or alien like devices, Reminiscence takes on a more realistic quality that is all about showing adaptation to poor scenarios and what humans would resort to when so much is robbed. Seeing all the surviving cities, getting adapted to a much smaller world, yet still doing the same sinful vices that we as humans indulge in establishes a great place for this mystery to unfold and not stray too far from the feeling of the movie.Character Usage
You know me and how I like characters to have adequate time and integration into the story, and fortunately I felt this movie succeeded in that aspect. Reminiscence has a lot of clues to dive into and a lot of people to bring those clues to light. Like a great crime mystery, the characters in this ever shrinking world all have a place in the story, each one leading to the next piece of the puzzle or providing an adequate obstruction to overcome. So many characters provide that one integral piece and often come back at a later time to help close the case up and provide adequate drive to each character's outcomes. Even the most insignificant character has a place in the story and I love seeing that kind of planning on profile come through in a manner that other movies fail to achieve.Acting:
I think the acting on this is not the biggest mind blowing performance, but it certainly brought the characters to light. Newton's role as the sort of partner in business of Jackman, has some vim and vigor to her character, pushing Jackman to defy his addiction and focus on the case. She's got some demons of her own past to conquer, but I like the fire and depth of her involvement to help add some kinks to the linear story to shake things up. Rebecca Ferguson as well does a great job in the complexity of her character Mae, especially given the mono emotion she seemed to be directed in for the film. Like Gone Girl, there is a lot of mystery behind Mae, a truth that is buried deep between various placements in the drowned world. Much like other dramas, she is the key to so much of the plot, dropping clues, leaving breadcrumbs so to speak, and she does it with that mastery of a drama star. The looks, the mannerisms, the coy manipulation of her actions is alluring to me as it was Nick and I loved the evolution as the ending started to play out. As for Jackman, the man is one of my favorite actors for many reasons, and though this is not the most stunning performance, I can't help but feel he belongs in an audiobook future. Jackman's portrayal of torture and longing is executed quite well, He's got a wide array of things to piece together, and seeing all the adaptation to the scenario was good in my opinion. The realistic struggles, the reaction to the truths, and so much more is well crafted and I enjoyed seeing him in this detective role.The Mystery Itself:
It's nothing mind blowing again, and let's be honest it has a lot of familiarity to several other great detective cases. Yet, I still enjoyed the attention to detail and the ever evolving nature of the mystery at hand compared to how it starts in the first twenty minutes. A simple search for a missing love interest opens up to many connections, and utilizing the other likes mentioned above, starts to turn into something that requires some attention to make connections. The stretches to bring clues together are minor and I liked seeing the thought into bringing these supposed separate sections of the world together. Small details, origin stories, and even ambiguous clues have some relevance to it and it was fun to see that come together for the final mystery. Even the ending wraps things up to a level I feel is quite good for closure, poetic, emotional, and again fitting to the story set up in the throngs of this mystery.DISLIKES:Originality is Not Maxed out:
The realistic work is nice and goes with the level of science fiction that is not quite borderline fantasy. Yet, for the concept built up about reminiscing and diving into memories, there was still more that could have been done with it. Similar to minority report, the diving into a memory could have used a little spice to the mix to really help it stand out, give this tale a little more unique flavor they were shooting for.More of the World Exploration:
Despite good set up and again establishing the boundaries of the new flooded world, there was still more that could have been elaborated on. Several of the districts could have taken a video game approach and added a little more creativity and dynamics compared to the bland colors they chose. We could have seen some new designs for how they managed electricity and power, or how the social classes could have had different palaces in the battle for dominance. There was more potential to bring the case into, and though I think the pieces were well placed, some more creativity could have helped give it that originality bonus I mentioned earlier.The Flashback to the War:
The war is mentioned a bunch and plays a significant mention in their background, and yet we never really see it. I'm not saying it's place in the mystery is really significant, but for so much mention and character development use, I would have enjoyed some flashbacks and maybe a clue or two hidden in the memory of the war. Another one of those components where a big detail was sort of just included, this element could again expand a little more of the story and play off the reminiscence focus of this movie.The Pacing:
Like many, the biggest complaint I have of this film is the fact that movie is very slow in the long run. Slogging through the grey and dark environments, the constant looping of one location and barely making any progress gets a tad monotonous. Reminiscence's pacing is trying to give you enough time to get entrapped in the mystery and onto the characters, but the fact that some of the sparkle is lost to the realism at nearly two and half hours, is something that I do not think will go for the attention span of most audiences. With this slow pace, patience may be thin, or one may break up the viewing (if streaming) to really steal away from the storyline they are trying to tell. This is the biggest hinderance of the ordeal and the fact I warn to watch with more energy if possible.The VERDICT:
Overall Reminiscence is paying homage to the detective stories of old and mixing with the realistic science fiction that such a story works well in. The theatrics are well contained and worthy of executing the case, and I applaud the acting to hitting their marks for characters with not the biggest diversity, they do their jobs. Yet it's the playing by the rules, character utilization, and the pieces well thought out and integrated that are the main selling points for this mystery and solving the matter at hand. And yet, the movie is not fully utilizing the science fiction aspect it could do so well, and the movie really needs more creativity to offset the bland grey that sort of slows down the movie. Some dives into the past, a little bit more world building/exploration are some other suggestions to improve, but really it's the pacing that needs the most revamping. This is not a fast movie, nor one with a lot of exciting pieces, and while appreciative of the look back into the days of mystery shows and novels, it is that element that may deter you finishing the tale. Overall, this movie is one that is better at home than the theater, but worth a look for a good mystery.My scores are:Mystery/Romance/Sci-Fi: 7.0
Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0.",Reminiscence
37,rannynm,"While the film has some strong points, they're not strong enough to hold the film afloat",6,21 August 2021,"Reminiscence is an overly long film with a lot of loose ends. The movie strives to be a romance and yet the love story is weak. While the film has some strong points, they're simply not strong enough to hold the film afloat.The storyline follows Nick (Hugh Jackman), a man desperately in love with Mae (Rebecca Ferguson). After she vanishes, Nick uses technology known as the Reminiscence, which lets users revisit memories that they've forgotten. Nick uses the memory technology to locate where and why Mae has left. Slowly the truth unravels only to reveal dirty secrets.The movie definitely has its upsides. One of the film's strongest points is the friendship between Nick and officer Watts. The two go way back, and it's even confirmed by Watts that she's in love with Nick. Watts does everything possible to prevent Nick from burning a memory in his brain from using Reminiscence too often. However, they have a falling out and their argument is never really resolved, ending in an uncompleted arc. The whole world is flooded; it is unclear as to why. It appears as though there has been a war - one in which both Nick and Watts are veterans of. The war is only mentioned; it's never really addressed in depth, which leaves many loose ends. The war is the reason for the international flood and sinking of London, but there's no description or overview of the war. Throughout the film, there are glimpses of memories of Mae and Nick together. These memories end up being repeated over and over, which can't help but feel repetitive. Nick's love for Mae is supposed to feel unending, but it feels limited by these few memories.The lesson Nick learns is to believe in love. He goes the distance to learn the truth about Mae, refusing to believe that their relationship was one-sided. He goes against his closest friend and hardcore evidence to find the truth, even subjecting himself to the Reminiscence forever.I give Reminiscence 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 16 to 18 plus adults.

Secondly it presented a dystopic world, following war, where the present was so miserable and precarious that no one wanted to live in the present.Nick (Hugh Jackman) and Emily (Thandi Newton), ex-forces types, ran an ""access your memory"" bureau business. Much of the graphics and the interpretation of the images was not dissimilar to Minority Report and there was a smattering of Blade Runner, however derivative this aspect of the movie was brilliantly handled, I was gripped!We then an old style crime thriller as our damaged hero tried to resolve his PTSD and hunt a killer.What was less satisfactory, firstly, there was a lot of style over substance and the movie sagged a bit in places, I blame the edit, secondly the over feminised touchy-freely script grated on me, and seemingly diluted what was largely an action movie. The denouement and conclusion were muddled, as they tried to conclude the movie as a great romance when it was established early on that all the romantic moments were a contrivance as part of crime, no person would seek to immerse themselves forever in fake memories.I'm giving this a weak 7 outta 10, Hugh Jackman was brilliant but I am sick to death of ""ball-breaker"" Thandie Newton and ""doe-eyed"" lolling Rebecca Ferguson, these actresses are being typecast in these demeanours when they have so much more to offer.

43,bankofmarquis,Could have used a better Director...like one of the Nolan boys,5,24 August 2021,"Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest Directors of our time usually making films that have an attribute of time in them. His brother, Jonathan Nolan, has had a hand in most of his brother's terrific works as well as the creative force behind such ""trippy"" TV series as PERSON OF INTEREST and the recent revival of WESTWORLD. In both of these TV Series, Jonathan Nolan was assisted by his wife, Lisa Joy.Lisa Joy has written and directed her own ""trippy, play with time"" film, REMINISCENCE that has quite a few of the hallmarks of a Christopher (or Jonathan) Nolan film - but it also has one very unsettling aspect to it - it plays like a twice over copy of something else.REMINISCENCE is a classic neo-noir with our hero being smitten by the femme fatale which draws him into her world, where murder, criminal activities and low-lifes run rampant all with a downbeat tone.This sounds like a terrific premise for a Christopher Nolan film, unfortunately, in the hands of Lisa Joy, it is like watching a local community theater production of a Broadway musical.The first 1/3 of this film is one long, laborious setup for the tragedy that will unfold and it is told at an uninteresting snail's pace. Reminiscence picks up a bit in the middle with a pretty good action scene - and plot twist - before squandering this momentum with mediocrity at the end.Joy's script - which was on Hollywood's infamous ""blacklist' of scripts for many, many years (a list of screenplays that are generally praised, but for some reason or another have not been produced), is at the core of the problem. The dialogue is not very interesting and dripping with heavy film noire clichés. She does not follow the Hollywood doctrine of ""show, don't tell"". She TELLS the audience much, much more than is needed and never really gives the audience any credit for figuring things out for themselves.For example, there is a ""dirty cop"" that is central to the plot (there always is in this type of film). So, how do the other characters in the film address him? ""You're the dirty cop...""I'd laugh if I wasn't so bored.What DOES work in this film is the acting of Hugh Jackman (as our hero), Rebecca Ferguson (as the femme fatale) and - especially - Thandie Newton as the ""Gal Friday"" of Jackman's. Someone needs to give this talented actress a true showcase of her talents.Someone also needs to give good ol' Cliff Curtis a vehicle for his talents - he is one of the most misused good performers in Hollywood and he is misused in this film as well.And...don't get me started on the special effects. If you are going to make a trippy, sci-fi, futuristic neo-noire thriller, you probably shouldn't cut the corner on the special effects, but this film does that, amazingly.But...with a good Director at the helm there is enough ""good enough"" here (especially in the acting) that you should be able to pull something decent out of it.But...Joy is making her theatrical film directing debut - exactly the type of director that this film does not need. What this film needed wasn't a rookie director like Joy, it needed a Nolan - either Jonathan or (preferably) Christopher to make this work. But, one will have to be contented with a copy of a copy.And that's just not good enough.Letter Grade: C+ (the performances of the leads almost salvage things.5 stars (out of 10) - and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Reminiscence
44,Vivekmaru45,I think Mind Probe would have been a better title for this thriller.,6,28 August 2021,"This is a fairly dark thriller about a character who meets the love of his life and then looses her forever. This is a pain we humans all share. I believe no one should experience this, but as we are just mortal men and women, the end is inevitable.Hugh Jackman became a household name as Wolverine of the X-men. His best performance and best movie remains the X-Men Origins: Wolverine. You should check this one out it you have never seen it.In this film Nick(Jackman) and his partner Emily(played by the excellent veteran actress Thandie Newton) have a business where they are able to offer their clients a trip back in memory lane(so-to-speak!). One day a client called Mae comes along to ask for help to recover some keys.Nick becomes infatuated with Mae and begins a relationship with her. Soon afterwards Mae mysteriously disappears and the whole movie is about Nick trying to find out what actually happened to her.This one is a watered down dark thriller and not like the excellent Harrison Ford movie Frantic which I would recommend as a better movie.",Reminiscence
45,abisio,Better if forget about this movie,1,22 August 2021,"If you are looking for very slow paced, full of clichés, totally predictable, without characters chemistry and incredible boring movie; then this is for you. Otherwise do not even try!!! It is for your own good.Let's go by parts.Thandie Newton is the best thing about the movie. She is totally credible in the action scenes (which are really poor) and as suffering/rejected person in love with her boss.Hugh Jackman a charismatic actor; lately doing depressing losers with languid performances that seems to be slow motion.Rebeca Fergusson can be credible in an action movie but she is not FEMME FATALE and her acting and chemistry with Jackman are cold as ice. There is no way you could believe she becomes the obsession of the main character.Script do not make any sense; what has to to a flooded Miami and war (that is never shown or explained properly) with a detective (?) story on Falcon Maltese / Chinatown style but with science fiction elements.The movie is explained through dialogs and VOICES IN OFF. Some of them are so cliched that are an embarrassment to hear. Lisa Joy (the unexperienced director) spent more time showing the flooded city that putting images instead of words. She seems to have gotten a nice budget; but wasted it in things that add nothing to the story.The sad ending; is forced and ultimately absurd. But most of the movie is on the same level so do not be surprised.In brief; this movie is an INSULT to the public. Is the kind of movies that make you REGRET going to cinemas. How it was released and how Lisa Joy get the budget and greenlight for this is hard to believe; but get away from it.",Reminiscence
46,bob-the-movie-man,I'll only remember how disappointing it was.,4,24 August 2021,"It's the near future and global warming and a recent war have drastically changed life in Miami. The days are too hot to do anything other than sleep, and the oceans have risen deluging the city. Ex-military colleagues Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) and 'Watts' Sanders (Thandiwe Newton) run a 'reminiscence' business, allowing customers to re-experience memories from their past as if they were there. But when nightclub singer Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) begs for their help in finding her lost keys Nick's heart, life and livelihood is thrown into turmoil.Positives:
The special effects showing a submerged Miami are impressive enough.I enjoyed the soundtrack by ""Westworld"" and ""Game of Thrones"" composer Ramin Djawadi.Negatives:
The script is dreadful. Hugh Jackman's does a voiceover, droning on incessantly about things like memories being ""perfect complete beads on the necklace of time"". (Yes, I appreciate it's aping film noir here, but if you're a regular reader you'll KNOW how much I HATE voiceovers!)Outside of the voiceover, the dialogue generally doesn't sound remotely like things that people would say to each other. There are some cringe-inducing segments of speechifying. That's when you can actually understand what's being said: I found the sound mix makes that really difficult with some of the lines.This seemed to me to be reflected in the performances of Jackman, Ferguson and Newton. Star-power indeed, but it appeared to me that they didn't have confidence in the words. Fans of the trio will, I think, be disappointed. (And I am a big fan of Rebecca Ferguson. She is again gorgeous here and - unlike in ""The Greatest Showman"" - actually gets to sing).Summary Thoughts on ""Reminiscence"": This film is a big disappointment to me. When I first saw the trailer, I went ""YES, YES, YES!!"". It looked like an interesting post-apocalyptic sci-fi with perhaps elements of ""Inception"", ""Waterworld"" and ""Flatliners"" thrown in. Jackman even gets to tussle with sheets on a rooftop again! (Was anyone else playing ""A Million Dreams"" in their head?). But then came the film itself. The result was that about two-thirds in I was really willing it to end. (On principle, I don't walk out of movies). To be fair, the story did pick up slightly towards the conclusion, so I could quietly put my 1* rating away.I really feel sorry for writer/director Lisa Joy in writing such a negative review. The executive producer of ""Westworld"" (who's also written and directed some episodes) had secured Jackman and brought some of her ""Westworld"" talent with her. I'm sure she put her heart and soul into this as her directorial feature debut. But I'm afraid it just did nothing for me and - given the talent available - came across as a wasted opportunity.(For the full graphical review, please check out onemannsmovies on the web, Facebook and Tiktok.

48,Sir_AmirSyarif,"A dull reminder of other, better sci-fi movies",6,31 August 2021,"Lisa Joy's 'Reminiscence' is a dull reminder of other, better sci-fi movies. It bears the appearance of a film noir like 'Blade Runner' (Ridley Scott, 1982) combined with the mind-bending idea of 'Inception' (Christopher Nolan, 2010). There's so much promise here, especially with Hugh Jackman, Thandiwe Newton, and Rebecca Ferguson on board, but the cheesy screenplay and stagnant directing never manage to live up to it.",Reminiscence
49,kjproulx,"A Cool Concept, Overly Explained",5,15 September 2021,"Original ideas that come from big Hollywood studios are a dime a dozen these days, with most of the best content coming from sequels, television shows, remakes, or great stories involving superheroes. As much as I don't like having to say it like that, that's where the focus has been for many years now. The greatest films of each year are usually the independent films that never get seen. Reminiscence is the very reason that's the case. Everything about this film from the concept to the trailer itself had me intrigued, but Warner Bros. Backed a project that doesn't do anything with its concept, making for a poor film overall. On top of that, nobody seems to be talking about it, even prior to its release. Original ideas need to also be marketed just as much as the sequels and superhero movies out there, otherwise they will be left in the dust. Here's why I believe Reminiscence to be a great example of a film that does absolutely nothing with its cool concept.The first act of this film had me completely invested. Reminiscence begins with the explanation of what has happened to the world in the future and hardly anyone benefits from the remaining pieces. For that reason, people love to revisit their past memories. With the help of a business run by Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) and Emily 'Watts' Sanders (Thandie Newton), people are able to step into a mind device that shows them and gives them a euphoric experience, almost as if they are back in that moment. This device is known as the Reminiscence device and some thought-provoking questions are brought up throughout the film. This specific aspect of the film that makes the overall premise possible, is fantastic, but the premise itself is terrible.When a woman named Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) enters their business, Nick instantly finds himself attached to this woman. Becoming romantically involved, they share some nice moments together, but then she vanishes. The premise of the film is basically the fact that Nick is obsessed with Mae and needs to find out where she went. I instantly found this choice to be a huge mistake because there was no way this particular story could've fulfilled the nice set-up of the world they live in. The further I made it into the film, the more and more I cared less about what was on-screen. The overall story was so unengaging that I didn't care what the outcome was by the conclusion.Written and directed by Lisa Joy, who is best known for her work on the series Westworld, I would say did a nice job directing, but I personally think the screenplay was overly written. There are far too many instances of narration by Hugh Jackman, basically spoon-feeding the audience with all of the information they need to understand each scene. I felt the world and characters more than spoke for themselves, making nearly all of the narration (although well-spoken) unnecessary. The visual style of the movie was also very cool to look at, blending the CGI background seamlessly with the in-camera imagery (most of the time). For how lived-in this world feels, I just felt like this film would've felt like a mess without the narration, but the narration was also distracting, so it's a bit of a catch-22. I'm not saying I could've done better, but the tone of the film clashed with everything happening on-screen for me.Overall, Reminiscence deserves praise for its unique setting and concept, but if that's all a movie can provide, other than an overly simplistic disappearance plot, it fails as a whole for me. Hugh Jackman is giving it his all here and I thoroughly bought into this man's obsession, but it felt like it belonged in a different film. Rebecca Ferguson also provides a nice level of mystery to the film with her performance, but again, how it was written just had me not caring. I can't bring myself to recommend this one to anyone, but if you're always looking for a cool sci-fi film to watch, you may find more enjoyment out of it than I did. Reminiscence is now in some theatres and streaming on HBO Max, but there are much better viewing options right now.",Reminiscence
50,kuarinofu,This one is hard to judge,7,22 August 2021,"It is impossible to unequivocally evaluate this film.There are plenty of bad aspects of the film, and they are significant:1) the main story (it is very simple and predictable in its core yet has lots of overcomplications).2) the world (the things we see seriously mismatches the things the characters say, also, the nightlife thing was obviously made-up for the purposes of pushing the noir style, since there are lots of daylight scenes and there is nothing special about it).3) the characters (some of the things they do and say are just groundless, sudden rambo-style rage breakouts, executions, hardcore rage, etc.). Also, the dialogue is way too artistic, but this fits the style so I'm mostly ok with that.And yet there were many things I enjoyed:1) the cinematography.2) the score.3) some of the psychological and emotional moments were memorable.Aside from all the plot holes and inconsistencies, hard cuts and contradictory rules of the world (mostly there for the social commentary), I can say that I still enjoyed it. Many reviewers compare the film to Strange Days, and I can agree to a certain extent, but obviously, this one is inferior.If you're willing to suspend your disbelief and watch an almost successful attempt at film noir with a good emotional background but lacking a story - I'd recommend it, but don't expect too much. If you get easily bored by dialogue and slow scenes - probably you should avoid this.",Reminiscence

To reach it, all you have to do is watch this movie and sleep halfway through it.Holy cow what the heck was this movie. For two and a half hour it was a battle trying not to sleep. Everything was monotonous. The cinematography was decent and created a calm and dreamy atmosphere, just like going down a trip of memory. The story was boring and uninteresting. It's basically two and a half hours of a dude trying to find a crackhead. There's a plot about political corruption and the dreadfulness of Miami. Of course I could not care any less about this dumb and boring story. Honestly there wasn't much going for this movie, it just got stretched out for like forever.Okay, you think maybe Hugh Jackman might save this movie. But nope, the script didn't give him a lot to do. There's some action and intense scenes, and he was okay in them. Most of the time he was just grumbling and walking around. Worse, he had to narrate every single thing about the movie. Again, his monotonous voice almost put me to sleep. There's a scene where he was reacting to a memory of someone that he put into reminiscence, and he basically uttered out all his thoughts.

As far as I'm concerned; this wasn't as terrible as few people suggested it to be. I mean, I get it. I do understand everyone's frustration and disappointment about the film; but somewhere down the line, there was this tangible narrative that does work to a certain degree in my opinion.Albeit I do acknowledge the fact that the flaws are hard to look past. Even more so, when you could firmly recognize all the wasted potential. In other words, this was indeed a fascinating concept that was entitled to greater attention & treatment whatsoever!Set in the dystopian future, it was full of weighty ambitions; there's no denying that. But the problem is they took a gamble and incorporated too much in here, more than was necessary! And the sad part is, almost all of them ceased functioning. What could have easily been a simpler feature about Love; ended up being a contorted commotion of varied approaches.I only say this because I absolutely adored the chemistry in-between Hugh Jackman & Rebecca Ferguson (All thanks to their charisma and likability I suppose). Not to mention, some of those dramatic shots and an imposing score all around; immensely aided in that regard as well.Had it been supervised properly; things could have been turned out differently.

56,MrDHWong,A convoluted mess of storytelling that squanders an otherwise good concept,4,26 August 2021,"""Reminiscence"" is a sci-fi noir film written and directed by Lisa Joy (Westworld, Pushing Daisies, Burn Notice). Starring Hugh Jackman, Rebecca Ferguson, and Thandiwe Newton, it is a convoluted mess of storytelling that squanders an otherwise good concept.In a dystopian future, the citizens of Miami, Florida have been forced to adapt to a nocturnal existence due to rising temperatures and flooding. Deep within the city, war veterans Nicolas ""Nick"" Bannister (Hugh Jackman) and Emily ""Watts"" Sanders (Thandiwe Newton) run a business that allows clients to relive old memories through a special machine known as ""Reminiscence"". One day, a new potential customer named Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) arrives asking Nick and Watts for assistance in finding her misplaced keys. Despite Watts' reluctance to trust her, Nick soon hooks Mae into Reminiscence, where he starts to develop an obsession over her past, culminating in the two pursuing a forbidden romance.Science fiction and film noir are two genres that go together like bread and butter. This is because most stories set in a sci-fi environment tend to involve a crime or mystery that plays well into the investigative nature of the characters usually seen in noir fiction. ""Reminiscence"" attempts to blend these two genres together with its intriguing premise but ultimately fails to get it off the ground where it matters most.Admittedly, the film's first ten minutes did succeed in drawing me into its post-apocalyptic world where the Earth's polar caps have melted and extreme temperatures are a major problem. This is obviously intended as commentary on climate change, which is an increasing point of discussion as it becomes more of an issue as time marches on. Unfortunately, I quickly lost interest once the actual plot kicked into gear.Early on, it is established that the reason why paying customers use the Reminiscence machine is to escape reality, which, to be fair, is a decent idea. However, once Mae enters the picture, things take a turn for the worst. Her character is so boring and onenote, and considering she's supposed to be the backbone of the entire film, this is a major problem. There's nothing interesting about her past, aside from her being a singing cocktail waitress, but other than that, little other information of importance is divulged to the audience. I never cared at all about what ended up happening to her in the end, instead hoping that Rebecca Ferguson at least had fun playing the role, because I sure didn't enjoy watching it.In her directorial debut, Lisa Joy fumbles her way through telling such a needlessly complex story, throwing so many twists and turns at us that it becomes a chore to simply follow along. It felt as though the film became so lost in wanting to be highbrow and philosophical that it forgot how to be fun. This is identical to the direction her TV series ""Westworld"" has gone in - starting off brilliantly but quickly losing its way into an orgy of confusion and befuddlement.Additionally, Joy borrows heavily from better films that also dealt with journeys into the human mind such as ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Inception"", the latter of which was made by Christopher Nolan, the brother of her husband Jonathan. While it isn't uncommon for filmmakers to take inspiration from other works, nothing here felt fresh or original. I often checked off how many tropes and clichés I could find during my viewing, to the point where I was writing them down on a nearby notepad. It's moments like this take me out of the movie and make me wish I was watching something else instead.It comes as quite a surprise that with an actor as charismatic as Hugh Jackman in the lead role that he never manages to connect with the audience. Jackman is known for his likeability and screen presence, yet Rick is one of the dullest characters he's ever played. At no point was I ever invested in anything he was going through, as most of the film consists of him either staring intently at a bad guy or peddling tedious exposition in an attempt to move the plot forward. Worst of all, he has no chemistry with the rest of the cast either. Hugh Jackman is the type of bloke who could get along with virtually anybody but his interactions with the likes of Thandiwe Newton and Rebecca Ferguson always seemed unconvincing. I place the blame here on a poor script and in no way believe that Jackman would ever act this badly on purpose.All things considered, Lisa Joy has proven she has a long way to go before she'll ever be able to create content on the same level as her husband and brother-in-law. I do see the potential though, as she has had a hand in coming up with some fantastic ideas in the past but without true vision or focus, we can only end up with mediocrity. It's truly a sad case to see so much hard labour go to waste on something like this.I rate it 4/10.",Reminiscence
57,cardsrock,Most disappointing film of the year,5,23 September 2021,"This had so much potential. The premise is great. The cast is solid. The writer/director is the co-creator of Westworld. However, the end result is a boring slog that misses the mark.The whole city underwater thing was pretty pointless as it didn't affect the story at all. It takes about 90 minutes for anything to happen. I really didn't care about the characters or their motivations. The story just doesn't grasp you or really justify why a film was centered around it.I love the idea of a sci-fi/noir mashup, but this was pretty poorly executed.",Reminiscence
58,CANpatbuck3664,"A Huge Swing for the Fences, Very Ambitious But Some Things Work and Others Fall Flat",7,21 August 2021,"I didn't know anything about this movie until I caught the trailer ahead of The Suicide Squad and the first thing that catches your eye (other than the attractive A-list cast) was the sunken city of Miami and this idea of the flooded possible future of the U. S. south coast. Say what you will about the story beats or the narration, this is a beautifully crafted world and its wonderfully shot (my hat off to director of photography Paul Cameron). A high concept like this could easily come of an unrealistic or stupid but this version of futuristic Miami is haunting and while not wholly original, it underscores the bleakness of Nick's life. The turmoil surrounding the floods and the further divide between the classes does factor into the plot but minus the aesthetics (which doesn't disappoint) it makes for an excellent backdrop. The visuals with the Reminiscence process reminded me a lot of Joy's TV series Westworld, they catch your eye but they also made me a little uneasy, they were eerie and something below the surface was there and it held me at arms length from trusting the process of Reminiscence. The action scenes were also well shot, I thought they worked surprisingly well for a movie that wasn't primarily marketed on it. Hugh Jackman's character isn't Superman or John Wick but he knows how to fight and he defeats his opponents through a combination of technique and situational awareness. The action scenes got the job done and that's all I needed from them.I was surprised how little hype there was about Reminiscence's release because of how many talented actors are in the cast. Hugh Jackman is a great leading man but I'd describe his performance as workmanlike in this. He's fine and he showed up to work but I can't say he was a revelation as Nick. With how full of angst Nick was as a character, I kept expecting his Wolverine claws to come out and have him yell MAE at the sky. Rebecca is suitably cast as the femme fatale but like Jackman, she's hindered by her character. Her chemistry with Jackman is serviceable but it falls short of Nick and Mae's love being one for the ages like the movie needs it to be. She's fine as Mae but nothing to write home about either. I thought Thandie Newton gave the best performance as Watts, her character's feelings for Jackman are always there through her performance but also suitably hidden, she's fiercely loyal to Nick and she makes the most of the occasionally hammy bits of dialogue she's given. Cliff Curtis comes in and out of the movie but he's an accomplished performer and he's good as the villainous Cyrus. I also liked Daniel Wu in his short amount of time as Saint Joe, his character feels a little tacked on but he was solid as a Cajun gangster type.The window dressing is there but next we have to start talking about the plot. Reminiscence is a sci-fi noir mashup and I love a good film noir story. But after reading reviews from the critics, I agree that Reminiscence follows a predictable arc and its got its share of genre cliches. I still enjoyed the story and while the middle of Reminiscence lags and could have been edited tighter in some scenes, I thought the ending had some nice turns to keep you involved. So, to enjoy Reminiscence, you'll have to forgive some familiar beats in the plot, some big exposition dumps in the dialogue and some cliche character choices. I was able to get past those bumps in the road but if you're not in a forgiving mood, it could wreck the experience for you.The biggest flaw in Reminiscence is the characters and character motivations. Nick is SO obsessed with Mae even though they were only together a few months to the point that he's willing to let his business fail, wreck his relationship with his best friend and partner Watts and repeatedly risk life and limb to find her. She's obviously duplicitous and untrustworthy from moment one and it was pretty maddening that he couldn't see the bigger picture. Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson are good actors but they aren't given enough time to make this kind of sacrifice believable. Its the crux of the plot and it doesn't gel. Nick isn't a terrible person or an uninteresting protagonist, he was just too flawed to sympathize with.Reminiscence wanted to be on the level of something like Inception or even Westworld and while I loved the ambition behind it, its too inconsistent and cliche to hit that level. But it also avoids the other side of the spectrum e.g. Surrogates or Jupiter Ascending (which I still don't hate but definitely missed the mark). Joy's vision is fully realized through the cinematography, the concept plays despite some problems, I was always interested in where the plot was going to go and I thought a couple of the twists at the end worked. This is actually my favourite kind of movie to talk about, its easy to heap praise on a masterpiece or laugh at or rail against something terrible. I had more fun with Reminiscence than I expected to and despite it not being a home run, I appreciated its ambition and its a film that can be dissected and discussed after the credits roll. I wasn't disappointed to catch it in the theatre based on the visual flair Reminiscence has but from a quality standpoint, I'd recommend catching it on your preferred streaming service.",Reminiscence
59,statuskuo,Hard Boiled Memories,8,22 August 2021,"I am a massive fan of the film noir genre so allow that to be the barometer of how I rated this.The story is of living in the past and how some of is would like to filter out all the bad and focus on the good. Enter Nick Bannister. A former soldier of a war that destroyed Earth's environment, where floods literally dissected the have and have nots. Reminiscent (get it) of ""Chinatown"" the rich gobble up all dry land and cultivate their fortunes by exploiting the poor. In this case keeping them sub-water level to scrounge for drugs to keep their society suppressed.Now, yes...it's goes over movies we've seen in the past. The dystopian future where crime is survival and people live in such abject awfulness they are pleased whenever sun shines on them. In Nick's case it comes into the form of Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) a luscious lounge singer who seduces Nick into a darker world he is prepared for
Hugh Jackman is great in this as a grizzled old dreamweaver. He gets pulled in easily due to his own melancholy past. Where women are his weakness as a good guy wanting to save a broken woman. Along his journey is tough fellow soldier Emily Watts (Thandiwe Newton) who assists Nick in putting people under to enjoy their past. Her loyalty to Nick is deeply felt as to how he had ""rescued"" her after some PTSD as they are fellow soldiers. She seems to be the only one who understands his darkness.As the story unfolds, Nick is now obsessed with a woman who he had a passing relationship with. A few clever intercuts between memory and present time and the rest becomes a mystery of why darker forces are wanting to hurt Nick and anyone who he encounters.There is a deep sadness to the movie. It's no surprise that she is related to a Nolan. Similar feelings of bittersweet remoteness of people trying to regain emotional footing. In a world of near future tech. To me, the best parts are when Nick desperately seeks out the elusive mystery woman and unravels what you consider a femme fatale has deeper tolls to pay.Director Lisa Joy spins the tale at a solid pace. I didn't feel the over 2 hours this was listed as. Perhaps others saw an early cut. I found the concept intriguing and reminds me of a similar movie in ""Dark City"" in terms of feeling.I'm glad I ignored the poor reviews and experienced this for myself.",Reminiscence

This movie had me at Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson. I loved them in The Greatest Showman. Nick Bannister, a private investigator of the mind, navigates the alluring world of the past when his life is changed by new client Mae. A simple case becomes an obsession after she disappears and he fights to learn the truth about her.The dramatic mystery is directed by Lisa Joy who is the sister-in-law of famous director Christopher Nolan! This is her debut feature film after directing the popular HBO show Westworld: The Complete First Season (DVD)THINGS I LIKED:
I adore Hugh Jackman and will watch anything he's in. He's so talented, handsome, and charming. His fans will be thrilled to see him shirtless quite a few times in the film.Rebecca Ferguson is so beautiful. We all fell in love with her in The Greatest Showman, especially when she sang, only to learn that her voice was dubbed by American Idol contestant Lauren Allred. Stunning voice. In this movie, we actually do get to hear her real singing voice in several scenes. Unfortunately, it's nowhere near the level of Jenny Lind's, but good for Rebecca Ferguson for giving it a shot.Thandie Newton is such a likable actress.The scenes shown at the beginning of the film were fascinating. I wanted to learn more about what happened to make those images occur. Very good world-building with some cool visual effects.Nice cinematography.A few twists.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The screenplay stalls in its attempt at an apocalyptic film noir. It falls far short of its potential.The story is a bit confusing and boring at the same time.Even the action sequences were not very good.There are some insightful lines, yet the dialogue is not very inspiring.Sadly, this movie will be entirely forgettable.I kept wondering how the electricity would work in the buildings if much of the buildings were underwater.The world-building wasn't completely thought out. Many of the parts of the dystopian world just didn't make sense.As much as I loved the talented cast, some of them were not ideal for their roles. For example, I really like Thandie Newton but we're supposed to believe she was such a tough military might during a war that she has a reputation even though she's such a petite woman.It's really hard to get fully invested in any of the characters.Very slow pacing.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

61,sbweightman,"Soggy Noir - some great ideas, but flawed in its execution.",5,22 August 2021,"With the charm, style and character of a 'detective noir' film but set in an alternative future where ecological disaster threatens to end and upheave society, the film should have a lot going for it. Unfortunately, there isn't enough to make it stand out - the story keeps you engaged enough, but the setting is underused and it can't really decide what it wants to do with all of its ideas. The plot is traditional detective noir with plenty of twists, a damsel in distress, a handsome rogue who plays by his own rules, an alcoholic sidekick, mobsters and a corrupt elite ruling class, but this time, it has a memory viewing technology gimmick which once again provides the audience with the idea of escapism from the grim real world, a desire that many other recent productions have also tapped into. The acting is good with a strong cast who convincingly portray their tragic love stories and the infrequent actions scenes look good and add some excitement, although they do seem a bit out of place. The reminiscence mechanic is functional, but not very spectacular to watch, the slowly flooding city may look great, but is only used as an allegory and the social upheaval it refers to isn't used to any great effect. Much like this review, the film is too long to say too little and whilst entertaining enough, ends up being a bit boring.",Reminiscence
62,lareval,"To the very least, works as a good enough entertainment",6,22 August 2021,"This movie bring me reminiscences to 'Inception' (the visuals the city flooded, as well as the visuals and some dialogues), 'Chinatown' (the rich bennefiting from the poor and usin water as a tool was a little part of that plot) or 'Trance' (seeking answers in the memories). But it manages to stand for itself thanks to the presence and talents from Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson. The script is murky and sometimes weaker, but gets better towards the end. The story has some dramatic gravitas as well, which I appreciated. All in, not the worst movie of the year: just a decent entretainment not so original but with flow and interesting.",Reminiscence

64,JoelChamp85,Not Executed Well,6,22 August 2021,"The two things I liked about this film was Hugh Jackman and the flooded cities. Visually it's executed well, but I don't think the director was capable of achieving what was envisioned. The movie tries to use the backdrop conflict of Chinatown (1974) where there's an underlying problem that is surfaced by the investigation of the protagonist. At the same time trying to achieve the same narration style noir-crime that Sin City (2005) did so well, but doesn't reached the same protentional. I simply found the goals of the characters uninteresting and predictable, with a muddled/weak ending.",Reminiscence
65,sweidman-28016,Incoherent and Disjointed,5,30 August 2021,"""Memory is the boat that sails against its current.""Nick Bannister, a private investigator of the mind, navigates the alluring world of the past when his life is changed by new client Mae. A simple case becomes an obsession after she disappears and he fights to learn the truth about her. Reminiscence is a sci-if neo-noir given the opportunity of having a big budget. That can be both a blessing and a curse. The story is way out there, so much that it's hard to follow. The big budget helps with what it needs, but it also needed to make back its budget which will never happen. In its first weekend, it was number 9 at the box office (which is pretty bad), and now this week it didn't even make it in the top 10. I don't think it'll ever make it back and go down has one of the biggest flops of the decade. Lisa Joy has many interesting ideas, but none with explanations. It's to incoherent to follow even for the most attentive watcher. It also suffers from severe pacing issues. After 30 minutes, it's revealed that was all exposition. If it takes that long, something is wrong. Most scenes aren't needed for the final product. I know there's a lot going into the aesthetic, which I'll get into, but really it doesn't matter by the end. The parts I could follow did catch my attention and I would've liked to know more, but it's too disjointed.The script is very stiff. While it tries to be existential, it comes off as a bunch of random quotes found off the internet. One part, and I don't know if this is intentional, sounds like a ripoff of The Twilight Zone intro. It borrows ideas, but doesn't use them in the best ways. If one thing was right, it's the production value. The sets are really interesting to look at and you do get absorbed into this dystopian setting. The camera work looks good. And one of the most interesting things, at least for me, was the color scheme. It's so bizarre, but I guess it worked. The acting isn't necessarily notable, but I will say Rebecca Ferguson and Thandiwe Newton were good. I'm not sure what else to say. Reminiscence was just unremarkable. I never had much of an interest, and apparently most didn't. Only a few people have taken a strong liking to it and I'd like to see that perspective. I could see this gaining a cult following someday because it's having some reactions similar to Blade Runner and last year's The Empty Man. Maybe a rewatch is needed, but I can wait.",Reminiscence

67,TaylorYee94,You're just an empty man looking for a woman to blame.,8,26 October 2021,"'Reminiscence' is a great entertainment for me who has not watched 'The Maltese Falcon' or 'Westworld'. The film itself has many advantages, and they should not be overlooked. Just a little tip for people who want to enjoy this movie. Do not put too much emphasis on 'sci-fi' part, it's just a tool and setting to solve the mystery. Nick needs the technology to replay memories of people to track Mae. Go into the theater and expect high level of mystery. I get why people are harsh on this work because they try to interpret it solely based on science fiction side of it. Even so, I can find the director's ambition and effort in places.Set design. The setting that the world had flooded and that the war lasted for a while does not affect the story that much, but the production design audience can watch as a result of them is aesthetic. City on the water with lights reflecting everywhere. It gives not only futuristic ambiance but also fairytale and utopian ambiance when all things are calm, very much in contrast to dystopian narrative.Story development is tight. One lead leads to another like a chain. There is no leap of logic, and it is just interesting to follow Nick's journey together.Symbolism. Nick is obsessed with memory of Mae and with Mae and is afraid to confront the real truth at the same time. Mae and past memory are symbolized and accompanied by the light. When Nick is very close to the Boothe's memory, the truth, Nick turns away from the light when Boothe draws the curtain open in the fighting sequence. After Boothe drowns and struggles to come back alive, light is pinned upon Boothe whose memory is the truth. Nick hesitates but dives into the light. This time, Nick almost drowns but light or Mae whichever saves him. The director places metaphor here and there throughout the movie very delicately.There are some weaknesses as well. Saint Joe's lines are hard to understand. They are mixed with Chinese that audience does not understand without any specific purpose. Whenever he speaks, it becomes hard to follow even though it is important to the plot.Action sequence is cumbersome, dull, and slow. When I watched the fight between Nick and Boothe, it is hard for me to think it is an actual fight, but rather seemed planned ahead, 'If you hit here, I will hit you there'.",Reminiscence

I generally am not a big Scifi/Fantasy film fan. I end up watching a lot of them because my husband and most of my friends are. I went in to this film with very low expectations and ended up being pleasantly surprised.The visuals in this film were lovely, a true feast for the eyes. The acting was really well done. I thought Hugh Jackman, Thandiwe Newton and Rebecca Ferguson all did phenomenal jobs keeping me engaged in the film. The world building was also well done. It is set in our world but in the future where the oceans have risen and buried a lot of land (I appreciated that this didn't get preach-y about global warming), wars were fought but in the end there were still the rich who are living well and the poor who are not. There is this technology that allows you to revisit memories from your past, which people pay to do (hence the beautiful title Reminiscence). I don't want to say any more, because I want you to enjoy the film like I did.At the end of the day, this film was about a mystery, a con and following the money...but it was told in such a clever way that I would watch it again, and I do not know too many sci-fi/fantasy films I can say that about.Highly recommend...side note: the chemistry between Mae and Nick was just smoldering and it contrasted very nicely with the loyal friendship between Nick and.

72,Mike_Devine,A bad memory...or a worse nightmare?,3,24 August 2021,"Hugh Jackman has been trying to find his footing in a post-'Wolverine' world. He's hit it big once ('The Greatest Showman') and has had a few smaller roles that haven't received much attention. But his return to his should-be comfort zone that is action/drama in Lisa Joy's 'Reminiscence' is better left forgotten.Despite being an all-around disappointing film, there are a few aspects of 'Reminiscence' that are worth noting. For one, it's intriguing to see what a future underwater Miami could look like, so points are awarded for creativity in this regard. The cast is also strong, between Jackman and his 'Showman' singing co-star Rebecca Ferguson, as well as the venerable Thandiwe Newton. But this is what makes the end result less forgivable - to waste such talent.The dialogue in 'Reminiscence' is laughable to the point where you may look at your phone for a second and forget you're not watching a CBS procedural crime drama. The character development is unfinished at best, lazy at worst, and it's hard to feel a sense of attachment or empathy for anyone here. The storyline is also as choppy as the Atlantic.It's hard to say exactly what the core issue is here, but either way, it's clear 'Reminiscence' was left out to dry with its late August release. Not a high point of Jackman's career, to say the least.",Reminiscence

But the world-building, rushed lore that is noticeable in the background and only mentioned and never shown, development and execution just don't measure up to it's potential. And for the cast it has, their delivery feels undercooked, which is strange. And I feel like Rebecca Ferguson continues to play her roles with a ""I'd be better if you didn't love me"" face. Considering the script is also underdeveloped, it might be a problem with direction.I didn't manage to care about anything being told, and the sluggishness didn't help.

director: Lisa JoyStarring: Hugh Jackman, Rebecca Ferguson, Thandie Newton, Cliff Curtis, Marina De Tavira, Daniel Wu, Mojean Aria, Brett Cullen, Natalie Martinez, Angela Sarafyan etcNick Bannister (Hugh Jackman), a private investigator of the mind. Navigates the alluring world of the past when his life is changed by new client Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) A simple case becomes an obsession after she disappears, and he fights to learn the truth about her. I was very disappointed with Reminiscence. It was very much a film of two halves.My first few positives would be the fantastic cinematography. Interesting concept and idea. Great themes. As well as good character background, mystery and dialogue. This film had an interesting and unique visual style. Whether it was the creative slow mo's or the beautiful colours and scope the film managed to create. With the concept of the reminiscence and the process behind it being a truly visually stunning element to the film. I thought the concept and idea itself was really interesting. I thought the concept of being drawn to old memories was really well explored. Highlighting the positive and negative side to its high concept in an interesting amount of detail. I also thought because of this, the film touched upon some good themes. The themes on grief and holding onto the past were explored in a unique and interesting way. Giving the film a good amount of depth to explore. I also thought the character background was great, it was fascinating to see a lot of these characters lives being shown to the audience so easily through their memories, it gave you insight into what their life once was and made you understand or sympathise with them. The dialogue was also very strong. Some of the dialogue had a lot of depth to it and made me think a lot about some of the themes and questions the film was asking the audience. Therefore, engaging me with the film as it made me think. Finally, I also thought the film built an interesting mystery in the first half. The character of Mae was mysterious and had this secretive nature to her that really built a very strong mysterious allure and tone.However, my first few negatives would be the odd set up. Jarring shifts in time and rushed pacing. As well as unneeded scenes and underdeveloped and unlikeable characters. The film had a lazy set up between Mae and Nick. Having them meet for the first time because she lost her keys was just lazy and not very creative. Yes, it was explained more later, but they could have thought of something a bit more exciting than some lost keys. There were also some very jarring shifts in time. It was often very unclear on whether a particular scene was real or a memory. And they would often not set it up, so therefore when it was just a memory there was some very jarring changes when they suddenly went back to reality that really effected the pacing for me. There were also so many scenes that felt unneeded. A lot of scenes just repeated themselves or felt derivative of other works. And particular scenes which felt forced and thrown in for the sake of it. There was a lot of underdeveloped characters, the film added a new character into the mix far too often and couldn't keep up with itself. A lot of the characters were involved with big twists but were hardly in the film which made a lot of the second half completely pointless. And the characters in general were unlikeable. Nick was rude, insensitive and frankly ridiculous with his actions and it made it hard to connect with him as a main character.My final few positives are the chemistry and performances of the two leads. Some decent worldbuilding and twists. Some good development to the plot and action in the first half. And a likeable supporting cast. Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson both had fantastic on-screen chemistry. There chemistry was believable and fun to watch. Their romance was believable and the sexual tension between them both was very noticeable and well done. Both of their performances were also fantastic. Hugh executed a committed and passionate performance and once again proves how strong of an actor he is. Rebecca Ferguson was the true star, with a charming and enchanting performance that worked brilliantly for this kind of film, she played her role to perfection. Some of the worldbuilding was well done, the film expanded on its scope and story world well with a lot of new locations that were vital to the plot added to make the story more interesting. Some of the twists were also well executed. The twist with Mae and her dodgy past was interesting and added great development and a new layer to the film. Some of the action was also very strong. I wish there were more action scenes as the ones we did get were intense and entertaining and visually fascinating. I also thought the supporting cast specifically Thandie Newton was excellent. She bought some refreshing humour to the film and her dynamic with Nick was fascinating.My final few negatives would be the clunky pacing and lack of reveals. The underdeveloped second half. The underwhelming reveals and how tonally confusing it was. And the poor ending. The second half was poor I am just getting that out there. The pacing was so clunky and there was just a lack of reveals. The second half was just so slow and didn't go anywhere for so long. Without any meaningful development to the plot and characters and no reveals, leaving the audience in the cold for far too long. The second half was poorly written and just underdeveloped. It felt like they didn't have a clue what they were doing. With poorly written characters and odd creative choices that completely changed the films direction far too often, and the structure was just all over the place. The reveals and twists were also extremely underwhelming. The film spent so long building a strong mystery over the character of Mae and what they ended up doing with her character completely got rid of all that mystery and lure that the film had in underwhelming and poorly written twists. The film also felt very tonally confused. Not really fitting into one specific genre to make itself stand out. With a blend of action, drama, sci fi and film noir that just didn't blend well together. Finally, the ending was terrible. It was very repetitive and didn't know when to end. Not really resolving most of the films plot and it felt like it ended multiple times.Overall, Reminiscence has a fascinating visual style, a very strong first half and fantastic performances. But the second half was beyond poor. With terrible creative decisions, A plot that got too over complicated for itself. And it felt like they didn't have a clue what they were doing. In an underwhelming and forgettable film noir/sci fi that isn't in the league of the films it was trying to replicate.Overall rating 56/100.",Reminiscence

77,ginocox-206-336968,Squanders excellent elements on wokeness,5,23 August 2021,"Reminiscence (2021) has the necessary elements for an outstanding neo-noir film: a cynical hard-bitten amateur sleuth, an enigmatic femme fatale with a checkered past, corruption, betrayal, artifice, moral ambiguity, a tangled plot, and intriguing characters with closets filled with skeletons. Performances are excellent, particularly by Hugh Jackman (Nick), Rebecca Ferguson (Mae), Cliff Curtis (Booth) and Daniel Wu (Saint Joe). The plot is satisfyingly convoluted. Production values are outstanding. Yet, the film can't seem to maintain focus.As has become endemic recently, woke filmmakers seem unable to resist the temptation to put their audiences asleep with sophomoric political commentary and allusions. The film is set in a dystopian near future recoiling from ""the Border Wars"" and flooding caused by climate change. As the current villains du jour are the Chinese, the chief villain is played by Daniel Wu, better known as a Hong Kong megastar. The cast is an international potpourri of talented performers, including Australian Hugh Jackman, Swedish Rebecca Ferguson, British Thandiwe Newton, New Zealander Cliff Curtis, and Mexican Marina de Tavira. All police are corrupt and the only honest employee in the criminal justice system is a female prosecutor. The wealthy are irredeemably corrupt, having used their ill-gotten gains to move to gated communities on high ground. The audience is constantly assailed with political commentary, ranging from subtle to in-your-face, which distracts from the plot.Water is everywhere. The film has more water images than Hannibal (2001). Water can symbolize many things: cleansing, baptism, life. Babies gestate in an amnionic sac of fetal urine. Reminiscence clients are partially immersed in a sort of sensory-deprivation chamber half filled with water, while their memories are projected into a sort of three-dimensional stage filled with gossamer strands resembling falling rain. When Nick (Hugh Jackman) visits Mae (Rebecca Ferguson), she asks if he wants a glass of water, which she pours from a high-tech filtration device. As they embrace, the glass shatters (possibly an allusion to a Jewish wedding ritual) and filtered water overflows onto the floor. Nick's brush with death occurs when he saves a villain from drowning and must choose between the welcoming embrace of the sea and the searing light from above. The film begins with a dolly shot of the ocean's waters engulfing the lower stories of skyscrapers, and ends with Nick easing into one of the Reminiscence chambers. It's never clear what all these water images are meant to symbolize, if anything. They're impressive and look frightfully expensive. The water is eventually shown to be connected to the villain's plot, but seems more of a distraction than anything else.As with many films written and directed by females, Reminiscence has significant issues with nudity and sexuality. When sultry femme fatale Mae comes to his office, Nick says, ""If you'd liked to get undressed,
we provide modesty suits, so I can slip out while you . . ."" To which Mae replies, ""You're gonna see it all anyway, aren't you?"" The exchange establishes that clients need to be naked when they enter the Reminiscence chamber, but also creates a sort of Chekhov's gun, with the audience expecting to see Mae naked. But what follows is a series of awkward Hayes-Code-esque shots contrived to preserve the actress's modesty. The character professes nonchalance about nudity and is played by an actress from Sweden, a nation at the forefront of the 1970s sexual revolution, yet acts like a coy Disney contract player. Later, two other characters are shown in the chamber wearing garments and another is shown with medical breathing apparatus. Earlier, a wheelchair-bound character expresses an interest in revisiting memories of Angie, creating expectations of a steamy romantic interlude. But Angie turns out to be a dog. Nudity can represent innocence, or vulnerability, but the filmmakers equate it with adolescent titillation with no more insight than their handling of water imagery.The film has a massive cosmos of reality issue in that the memories are presented as if in a hyper-realistic three-dimensional landscape seen from the perspective of a fly on the wall or a three-dimensional animation creator who can view the action from any angle, including events not witnessed by the client.An extended gunfight is brilliantly choreographed and executed, but seems out of place in a noir film. Later the film seems to devolve into a chick flick before discarding all genre conventions to deliver a sophomoric statement promoting socialism.Reminiscence is evocative of Blade Runner, Seven, 8mm, Inception, Chinatown, and various noir classics. It has all the necessary elements for a cinema classic, but squanders much of its potential with self-indulgent ennui-inducing wokeness.",Reminiscence
78,pkpera,"Film Noir, distopia, crime .. and low realism",5,21 August 2021,"Ah, how someone can say 'low realism' about movie happening in future ?Surely can, probably most blatant was when Mae went in vault after meeting with Watts - that was shown as memory of Watts, while she clearly did not see it - otherwise would not let it. Not just unrealistic, but ehm, stoopid. Like comparing this movie with Inception. It was unrealistic too - we know now that dreaming is not accelerated, but it was not my biggest problem with Inception, just to say it, when it was mentioned here in multiple reviews. Just because author/director of this movie is related with brothers without local area network, it must not mean that she takes all inspiration from them. Whole tone of this movie was not what I saw in movies of much more famous relative.I think that acting was good, really can't imagine some actors doing better with this material. I saw Hugh Jackman in much better movies so far.For the end: is it possible that there is working electricity in buildings which lower 50-100 yards are under water ?

79,movieman6-413-929510,"Interesting, but well-known film that lacks details.",5,28 August 2021,"Reminiscence is a new Sci-Fi mystery thriller directed, written and partly produced by Lisa Joy. This is only the first film she has directed in her film career.The film is set in the future where the water level has risen and most cities have been submerged. In this future there is technology that allows people to retrieve your memories, to show them to you so that you can relive your memories. Others can also use this way to obtain evidence, to solve crimes. Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) tries with this invention to help people with treatments for a fee. When the mysterious Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) also books him for treatment, Nick begins to become obsessed with her. When Nick learns that Mae has gone missing, he decides to find out where she has gone using his own memories and the memories of people who last saw her.That this film fits the first film that Lisa Joy has directed and written, can be seen from the film. She also seems to be inspired a lot by the TV show Westworld, which she has also worked on and the works of her husband Jonathan Nolan and brother-in-law Christopher Nolan. This film comes across as the film work they have previously worked on, such as the film Inception, only instead of dreams, this film uses memories to get certain information. For example, this film can come across as familiar to film connoisseurs and sometimes even as a lesser copy if you compare the film with films such as Inception.The film lacks details, because what exactly happened to the world and the rising water level is not clearly explained. You only hear about a war and climate change could also be the reason. The film also lacks clear information about how the technology used to retrieve the memories can be manipulated or influenced. So at a moment it comes across as if they are simply doing something so that the story can continue. The visual effects look reasonable, but you can also see that the flooded cities are projected on a green screen.The film cast does a good job. The relationship between Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson starts off a bit strange. Hugh Jackman initially comes across as an obsessed stalker rather than a lover, trying to find where the missing woman has gone. Together with Thandiwe Newton, he makes an entertaining duo as boss and assistant. Unfortunately, this relationship is somewhat overshadowed by his search for the missing client. Rebecca Ferguson also comes across well in the film, but due to the mysterious side of her character, it is a bit unclear what exactly is going through her mind and what exactly she wants to do.",Reminiscence

81,srdjan_veljkovic,Tries to hard and aims to high,5,28 August 2021,"There are interesting ideas in there. The story is somewhat interesting, there are parts in the middle where you're actually eager to see what's going to happen, like in a good thriller you should.But, it tries too hard to be more than it is. This is not some Blade Runner level story about the human condition. Nor is it some epic tale like the Matrix.Also, it aims to high, with too many metaphors and ""bigger than life"" plots, twists and loops and way too many social commentary. No, there are no time loops, thank god, there have been way too many tries at striking the Groundhog Day gold in the last few years. They are story loops, much like many others, but, still, with an interesting perspective.It's also too long. There isn't enough of a story or suspense for almost two hours in there.Casting is decent. It's nice to see Hugh Jackman stepping away from Wolverine. He's still struggling to do so, but, he's getting there.Rebecca Ferguson is miscast. She's no femme fatale, and the way her casting works in Mission Impossible is that she's a ""tough, sexy spy"", that is, more of a Tom Cruise's female counterpart than a Mata Hari. She does do a decent job, though.Of the rest, only Thandie Newton has a significant part and she's also decent. She does miss several opportunities to do better, but, unfortunately, one learns to expect that from her.Director/writer/producer Lisa Joy obviously took on too much here. Even doing only one of those jobs on an adventure like this (which aims high and tries hard) would be tasking, let alone all three. It might have actually led her to believe that she can do it, because she has total artistic control.One does find it very refreshing that a movie that is a complete artistic product of one woman does not have a touch of feminism. Sure, there are few jabs at men, ""who don't see what's right in front of them"", but, that's to be expected and, hell, it's often right, actually.Story wise, the ending is kind of bad. It takes too long, does not make much sense and is too ""poetic"", in a way.Streamlined to something under 90 minutes, without social commentary and with more ""making sense"", this could have been a solid sci-fi thriller. As-is, it's only somewhat interesting if you want to see what happens when people try to hard and aim too high.",Reminiscence

On the other hand he also offer his services with a side business allow people who choose not to live in the present to relive memories to escape the troubles of their lives. Nick eventually meet a woman named Mae(Rebecca Ferguson) and falls in love with her, but after time's passed Mae's gone missing and he can't find it in himself to move on. Nick figures something must've happened to her so uses reminiscence to go on a mystery to find out what happened where did she go only discover something much more complex going on. One of the biggest attractions and highlights of the movie is the concept of memories. It also serves as it's handicap the way it's handled you've seen this concept done before with other films such as minority report and inception. Reminiscence feels as if they're trying to recreate that tone of Inception, but trying to throw it in with sci-fi noir style feel like blade runner. It tries to make it seem like it's more meaningful deeper then it actual is. Hugh Jackman's good at the movie has a good voice for his constant monologue and very enticing and soothing, but it doesn't really say much when you're not given much outside of being just an obsessed person. It could've worked if more time was given prior to scenes of them interacting with each other, but given how the film is structured it doesn't really seem as though a considerable amount of time has past. You don't really feel any sort of relationship between these two it just comes off he's more obsessed with her than actual affection. The Film tries to be a mix of sci-fi with classic noir style Jackmans constantly monologue throughout the story in a style kind of similar to Rod Sterling from the twilight zone. The cities being on the water does offer visually interesting setting, and seeing how they get around how many of the angle shot look creative. Although it's not really all that relevant to the story like it doesn't have that much of an impact. Top that off with the fact that it is constantly Hammering in the war the past of the Nick and his partner being veterans. The trenches things like this are constantly mentioned but you never see anything about this war no memorials, no memories. When it's the cause of why so many people hate their lives and this world now, it's pretty crucial that you explain what it is if you're Mention it this much. Overall reminiscence is an average film it's a basic plot but it tries to try so hard to immerse you with a theme that feels as it gets lost. While it get credit for trying to standing out and unique it falls lackluster with it's story.",Reminiscence
83,ilovefoodcoma,Hugh Jackman great acting!,7,3 September 2021,"Hugh Jackman is perfect for this role because he has such deep charming voice. There are many fighting scenes in the water, he did very well. I was also touched by many of his emotional scenes. He really gave it all.The storyline is more interesting than I expected since the reviews aren't that good.

It will be so cool.",Reminiscence
84,darkreignn,Needed more time to truly thrive,7,28 August 2021,"To fully thrive and succeed as a dramatic romance, ""Reminiscence"" needed more time. While watching, I often found myself awestruck at the stunning visuals and naturalistic world building. The near-future, dystopian sunken city of Miami looked incredible; the movie had more than its fair share of breathtaking special effects that managed to tell stories about the world, the characters, and the environment that they lived in. To me, that was enough to keep me interested and engaged in the goings on of the film. However, the crux of the movie involved the budding romance between Nick and Mae, Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson respectively - and unfortunately, that romance was not given nearly enough time to develop.The hook of ""Reminiscence"" isn't its gimmick of a machine that is capable of allowing people to relive their most cherished memories; it's the plotline of Nick Bannister searching for his lover, Mae, after she suddenly and mysteriously disappears. What happened? Where could she be? And, as the trailer so aptly puts it, who was she when not with him? It's an admittedly compelling premise, and would be even more compelling if the movie spent an adequate amount of run time organically building up the romance. It's obvious that Nick is attracted to Mae, but his love feels more like obsession, especially when the movie doesn't really show them falling in love. Sure, they meet, and the attraction is there, but then the movie seems to time-skip forward, and before you know it Nick is in love, and Mae is gone. Where was the development? Granted, the scenes between them are beautifully shot and romantic in terms of visuals showed, but the chemistry just isn't there.Because of that, you as a viewer won't necessarily feel emotionally involved in the romance, the characters, or their story. So, what will you be involved in? Simply put, the visuals. No, the writing and the acting is not good enough to be compelling - in fact, sometimes the dialogue is just plain bad, embarrassingly so. Its truly the stunning effects and worldbuilding that is going to keep your interest - both those things are so good, and work together so fluidly, that I had a surprisingly good time with this movie, despite its many shortcomings. As a science fiction movie, the world building was so competent and entertaining that I began to watch the movie strictly for that - and many times, it told a plethora of stories all on its own.If you're going into this movie because the trailer sold your on its action, I would recommend you turn back now, because the action is not only not plentiful but also uneventful. There are less than a handful of action sequences in this movie, and all of them are so unimpressive that it paradoxically started to become impressive. The action isn't necessarily badly filmed, but it's just bland; the fight choreography is poor - you can basically tell what moves the characters are going to make before they make them, and you can tell that the characters aren't actually hitting each other, which is a sin as far as I'm concerned. The action isn't believable, it just looks cheap, and there is a noticeable lack of intensity.All of those negative points aside, I really did enjoy this movie. The visuals and world building is legitimately impressive, and Rebecca Ferguson is attractive enough to add a significant amount of entertainment value. If you're a fan science fiction, I'd recommend you give ""Reminiscence"" a go - it's not an incredible movie by any means, but it is a good time.",Reminiscence

And this waterlogged deadweight has well and assuredly sunk.In short, the script is a mess. It's borrowed heavily and poorly from far better films going back decades. It's cornier, it's convoluted, the dialog is awful from the opening monologue. It's just bad all over.

After countless wars and natural disasters, the world is divided between the rich and the poor. The film follows Nick Bannister, who navigates people's memories for money. Nick's life is changed by new client Mae. A simple case becomes an obsession after she disappears, and he fights to learn the truth about her to navigating his and others' memories. While the film dragged at times, I thought it was pretty entertaining for a slow bur thriller. It also felt like a mix of inception and Minority report. However, the idea of memories being the key to solving a mystery was fresh enough to help the film stand on its own two feet. In addition to this, I thought the cast was fantastic. Hugh, the Wolverine, Jackman's performance was amazing, and this is just another example of how great of an actor he really is.

96,blrnani,The critical antipathy seems to be rooted in their inability to label it,7,24 October 2021,"Ostensibly this is an action movie (come on - Hugh Jackman). But it's also sci-fi (future world and futuristic technology) and a crime thriller. But it's also a love story (not one, but two, but you'll have to watch it to figure that one out). There is even a strong element of social commentary running through it.But this isn't a film that tries to be all things to all people. There's a very strong story thread running through it that binds the whole thing together without giving too much away, so it maintains the suspense almost to the end.We know pretty much what to expect from Hugh Jackman, despite his versatility in handling a diversity of roles. But Thandiwe Newton - I have always been a huge fan - reveals another facet and Rebecca Ferguson relishes in her role as a character neither HJ nor the audience are quite sure about throughout. She breathed life into the dying MI franchise, once they'd figured out that what made the TV series so great was the teamwork (ie: it ISN'T all about Tom Cruise) and she's great in this very different role.For those who keep their eyes and ears open, there is also an interesting spiritual message running through this film, encapsulated by one character's words: ""you saw something different in me and I liked and wanted to be that person you saw."" The way this world structured is geared to bringing out the worst, not the best in people. That is going to have to change if the human species is to survive and evolve!That so many try to do good even so is to their credit and inspires hope.

'Vertigo' is actually quite similar in this way, except Scottie was actually furious when he found out, whereas Jackman's character has an all is forgiven mindset.The cinematography was actually good and prompted thoughts of 'Blade Runner'. Though, the extended fight scene between Jackman and Cliff Curtis was atrociously choreographed. Daniel Wu was a diamond in the rough, but everyone else who is usually money ie. Thandie Newton, were uninspiring.Then the whole plot line using the memories and the machine just felt like a complete rehash of 'Inception' or even 'Deja Vu', both of which are supremely better movies I might add.To be clear, 'Reminiscence' is not terrible, there is much worse out there.

It is quite a good one, but it does not fit into mainstream production. It does struggle though a bit with performances, but I must defend the actors - they have to do what the director wants, like looking appalled for too long sometimes, etcetera. I think that the cast did very well, and we have to consider that the directress is not experienced. Which doesn't mean she didn't a good job, overall, no it's the exact opposite.It is a shame that this (quite expensive) production did so bad at the box office, but that is not the movie's fault. If 840000 households streamed it in the first three days during (!) theatrical release, I don't need to say more.Reminiscence is not an action movie, but a mysterious romance, with a few action sequences. Its qualities are in style, cinematography, mood, dialogue and pacing.And, of course, Thandiwe Newton. Rebecca Ferguson though, I consider a bit of a weak spot - I could not really feel her as 'Femme Fatale' and Hugh Jackman is sometimes a bit bleak for me, but again, I put that in the direction's responsibility, and to his (broken) character - he hasn't quite to save the world here. Both main characters are to be seen as ones of many survivors in a more or less depressing world.Contrary to many claims of boredom, the movie never bored me. Therefore, I give it a 7.",Reminiscence

2) The composer is one of my favourites currently working in film and TV, I thought the score was very good
3) It is certainly a ""concept film"" and I thought the concept was very interesting and thought provoking; the film does a good job of explaining the mechanics of 'the tank' and the rules of what can and can't be done
4) I was definitely intrigued by the mystery that is playing out throughout the course of the film, I remained engaged throughout and I think repeat viewings will enhance the viewing experience of the filmNEGATIVES:1) The writing definitely had issues in my opinion. The plot is unnecessarily complicated at times and some of the dialogue was frankly atrocious: the repeated conversation around 'a story with a happy ending', for example, was particularly cringe I thought
2) I was never fully sold on the relationship between Nick and Mae; he's completely obsessed with finding her and basically gives up his life at the end of the film to be with her; even though they've only known each other a few months it feels like?3) The film appears to end with Mae being effectively redeemed and portrayed as a good person, but as far as I'm concerned she was still deceitful, a drug addict, a kidnapper and a murderer??

108,Spartan_1_1_7,Middling experience at best. Disappointing.,6,2 November 2021,"Reminiscence (2021) is a sci-fi noir thriller and is a directorial feature film debut of Lisa Joy, the co-creator of Westworld alongside her husband Jonathan Nolan. She also directed one of my favourite episodes from Season 2. It is set in a not-so-distant future Miami where the world has been subject to rising sea levels wreaking havoc. Memory tech is a craze where one can relive their cherished moments from the past and Hugh Jackman's character is running a business of it alongside his friend played by Thandiwe Newton. Things go awry when a customer, played by Rebecca Furgeson, goes missing and Hugh's character takes it upon himself to find her. I was curious to check this out and sadly it was disappointing.The movie is competently made for the most part i.e the sets, the production design, the CGI, sound effects and music, the pacing, the cinematography, the acting, are all executed well enough that you get the feeling of a proper good looking and sounding movie. It's in the writing and story department where it falters and drags the entire experience down from being a good or even great one to a middling one at best.The movie mixes in different ideas and concepts, none of them new, and while on their own they are cool, when blended together with the story you get, it doesn't work nearly as well as there is a lack of energy and urgency that you don't really get throughout. You are experiencing the story play out and it's kinda OK but it never goes beyond that.There is superficial depth to the themes and ideas where the movie thinks it is being deep and poignant but you don't really get that feeling. It's just sorta there. Not to mention the fact that the entire plot hinges on a romance that was hardly developed so you don't get that connection which should hook you.Take out the competency in other elements and high profile actors and this would be bad but since those things are present, it goes up a few notches, so props to Lisa Joy for that at least and hopefully her next outing will be better. Rebecca Furgeson's beauty alone kinda pushes it one point above for me not gonna lie, it is what it is. Simply put, it was just OK. Disappointed cause it could have been a lot more. Maybe if Jonathan Nolan was helping with the script, that would have been the case, who knows. Not recommended but hey, if you are curious, give it a shot.

On the other hand we have perfect special effects, the film is a visual marvel, the performances are good, the social context is well planned and structured but it does not add anything to the story that is going to unfold.

111,hoernkeem,"Reminiscence (2021, Lisa Joy) Good depth of feel and setup but lacks payoff",7,1 September 2021,"Lisa Joy is not a name I am familiar with, but it gets my attention when you are the writer, director and producer of a relatively high profile feature starring Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson who last flexed their onscreen chemistry in 'The Greatest Showman'. It appears she rose to prominence off the success of the show 'Westworld' which she co-created, directed, produced and wrote. Now she has developed 'Reminiscence' as her first big screen adaptation. It is a very ambitious science fiction slanted neo-noir thriller. This film probably wouldn't have been a financial success in the best of times but the COVID-19 pandemic certainly hasn't done the film any favors. It was simultaneously released in August of 2021 in theaters and HBOmax.Hugh Jackman stars as Nick Bannister. The setting is Miami in the near future. It is not quite post Apocalyptic, but it is dystopian. There has been some war and sea level has risen to flood much of Miami which exists like a modern Venice, however, due to extreme daytime temperatures people mainly live at night. The super rich are the only ones who still occupy the dry land that hasn't flooded. Nick operates a business with his friend and partner Watts, played by Thandiwe Newton, also a 'Westworld' veteran. It is a reminiscence business, which Nick used during the war as an enhanced interrogation technique, where he uses a machine to allow subjects/clients to vividly experience past events and memories in their life. One day a woman named Mae, Rebecca Ferguson, walks in and utilizes the machine to help her find some lost keys. Nick is immediately smitten with Mae and they start a relationship, and then one day Mae vanishes. Nick, convinced she wouldn't just leave, starts an investigation utilizing both reminiscence and good old fashioned detective work. Each step he takes is like peeling back layers of an onion and he finds out many things about Mae who appears to have a lot of unsavory secrets. The mystery culminates in a showdown and some revelations and Mae's ultimate fate revealed.There is a decent amount of good and bad here. I loved the layered feel of the world these people currently inhabit. They didn't really need to have all the flooded world stuff or the post war stuff to really tell this story, however, it added some interesting depth to the story. I liked pretty much all the actors here and I very much enjoy good noir style detective stories which is exactly what this was. The main key to an upper echelon detective story, though is the payoff. Does all the cloak and dagger lead to a good, believable reveal at the end, and while all the twists and turns ultimately work in the narrative I couldn't help but feel that at the end this went out with more of a whimper than some sort of amazing climax. When you find out the mystery of Mae it was just okay. The other sticking point is the reminiscence technology. It is the lynchpin of the story structure for without it you cannot tell the story this way through all these fractured memories, but I feel like we have seen this style of technology over and over again that it has lost something. The whole tech setup felt very 'Minority Report', as just one example, although I realize they are not exactly the same, but for narrative purposes it is all cut from the same cloth. While I really enjoyed the production design and the look and feel of this film I just wish they could have put a story with a better climax and payoff in place along with some more originality as far as the reminiscence technology goes.Eric's Grade: B-",Reminiscence

118,terrylarosa,Great film noir of old with a futuristic setting,9,21 August 2021,"Eerie to see my hometown ( Miami ) like that but still cool. Nothing terribly new but still a good mystery that keeps you entertained until the end. Good acting throughout, especially Hugh. Rebecca is beautiful as always. Great to see them together again from The Great Showman. There's nothing convoluted or complicated about the movie if you have an actual thought process. Is she bad, good. Is there true love? This takes the meaning it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all to a whole new level. A couple of good action scenes keep things moving but it's Hugh's eternal yearning to find the truth that wins the movie. Never was I bored despite the slow pace. Reminiscent ( pun intended ) of Inception and Minority Report. The new crop of movie viewers are so pathetically demanding but they end
liking utter trash like the movie Joker. Final tidbit: that's not the way the story of Orpheus ends but I can understand Hugh's spin on it. Enjoy if you can think for yourselves.",Reminiscence

Writer/Director Lisa Joy has combined a still-born screenplay with uninteresting direction.The voice over is shockingly-bad saccharine flowery prose, uninterestingly delivered by Hugh Jackman. Had they used a more iconic voice to read the voice over, like Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Kelsey Grammar or Jeremy Irons, it would have helped. For that matter casting someone else in the lead role would have helped. I don't know what Jackman was going for, but he never reached it. Thandie Newton is wasted with not enough to do, but she still provides the most interesting performance. If you're going to cast a chanteuse, cast someone who can sing, although Rebecca Ferguson can't act either.Flooded Miami is an interesting look, but of course, it would have been overrun with rats.

The audio track basically sounds like books on tape with all the interminable voiceovers from Hugh Jackman, featuring some of the same lines over and over again.The rules of the memory machine are very hazy and flexible to suit the exposition needs of the movie. Like we're reviewing a person's memories but they are showing us things that happened that they didn't see or hear at the time. Huh?Minor characters are over the top caricatures, with over-wrought lines. Thandiwe Newton does her best but isn't very believable as an alcoholic. She drinks an entire fifth and still comes across as sober, intelligent and wise. It also doesn't make a lot of sense that this is Jackman's ""best friend"" but she hides everything she knows about his love interest?It seems they going for some mashup of Inception, West World and the Matrix, but it was a cheap imitation at best.

This is solid noir; sometimes subversive of the genre, other times hitting tropes well.There were a couple times where the answer seems obvious, but for the most part it fosters doubt and suspension of disbelief enough for all of the compelling elements to sing. The script is good. The dialogue is uneven, but actually swings to quite good when it's not swinging back to a bit too much exposition. The set design is fantastic. The aesthetic is cool. Incorporating climate fiction, with the water level having risen, and the class stratification interplay, all worked for me.Will it blow your mind? No. But it is more intelligent and interesting than it seems to be getting credit for. It's a mash-up that was to my taste and what I didn't know I wanted going into it.

Other than that, this movie is quite bland. The conversations are vapid, and nothing really happens until very late in the movie. By that time, I'm wishing that the movie would end already. The only thing crossing my mind is how lucky we are as HBO subscribers to not have wasted gas, money on tickets and maybe on overpriced soda and popcorn, time spent waiting in line, and sitting in possibly dirty chairs.

There is zero chemistry and connection to his love interest, so his obsession with her just comes across as stupid. His hurt feelings are forced. The narrative/voice over technique is used instead of letting the movie tell the story on its own. Director knows the audience won't have a clue what's going on if they don't narrate it.

131,BijeshNagesh,Futurism Meets Filmmaking Excellence,7,27 August 2021,"Any movie starring Hugh Jackman is a movie worth watching. I saw mine in a regional theatre when it released only today since, sadly, we don't get HBO Max in India (hopefully for the time being). ""Reminiscence"" was a delightful, and oftentimes heart-stopping, look at Jackman delving into a shockingly underrated Sci-Fi story and role (as Nick Bannister, a war veteran).He joined forces with fellow ""Greatest Showman"" alum Rebecca Ferguson (who played the intriguing Mae harbouring more than her fair share of secrets) and produced outstanding chemistry within the framework of this deep and complex script, which is deserving of more appreciation that it seems to have gotten. Nick's desperation to learn what became of Mae (""People don't just disappear"") felt urgent and momentous.Thandiwe (formerly Thandie) Newton (who played Emily ""Watts"" Sanders, a war veteran who served with Nick) was back together (though briefly) on screen with her ""Westworld"" co-star Angela Sarafyan (who played Elsa Carine). Natalie Martinez (who played Avery Castillo) also gave a good performance. Plenty of other notable performances as well - Daniel Wu (Saint Joe), Cliff Curtis (Cyrus Boothe), Marina de Tavira (Tamara Sylvan).Written and directed by Lisa Joy, ""Reminiscence"" 2021 was equally memorable, engaging, thrilling, and eye-opening. It held plenty of 'near future' elements and themes - technology, corruption, implications, consequences.Ramin Djawadi kept pace through his musical scoring with the web of events and sequences that unravelled in this film. Paul Cameron's cinematography kept everything on point, visible and crisp for anyone to admire. Mark Yoshikawa's editing prowess deserves special mention, because he made the film - at least for me - come across as relatable and comprehensible despite it dealing with such a 'heavy' subtextual theme. Jennifer Starzyk's costume design was heartfelt in its attention to character-specific detail. All other teams in sundry categories truly did a number on ""Reminiscence"" that's deserving of attention and appreciation.I cannot for the life of me imagine why this movie garnered such low ratings on IMDB, and elsewhere. Was it the runtime (almost two hours)? Was it the 'dark adult' romance? Was it the full-fledged 'futuristic' take blended with thrills and paced potential? Was it the great acting from Jackman and Ferguson? Was the difficult-to-spell title?I honestly feel some people are too quick to rate things without taking the time to explore nuances, subtleties, and expression. The devil, as they say, is in the details. My suggestion: if you don't like the movie, get up and walk away or just change channels. Why put yourself through the effort of watching something you apparently hate only for you to rate it low and make others, like myself, think twice and almost not go see a film that I ended up adoring.I don't mean to sound preachy, am merely attempting to understand the sadly prevalent 'culture' where trendy tropes and instant satisfaction are giving a bad name to good artistry.""Reminiscence"" explored the possibility of going back through our memories and reliving past moments in vivid detail. This is something nearly all of us desire to try, and that this movie captured in a dark yet beautiful way. It portrayed an almost-noir future world altered by war and the growing demand from people who wish to (almost therapeutically) dive into a past memory if only to feel the relatively simple bliss of days long gone.It also exceptionally covered the Climate Change induced concept of rising global water levels. Brilliant production design by Howard Cummings, to say nothing of the excellence of Set (Leonard R. Spears) and Art decoration (Matthew Gatlin and Scott Plauche). I also appreciated the implementation of the 'memory machine' tech to help with law enforcement and criminal investigations. The action sequences were also superb.The movie ""Reminiscence"" on HBO Max was, in my humble opinion, a brilliant (tad cerebral but adequately dramatized) take on a familiar Science Fiction notion. Being a passionate reader of and dabbling writer in that very genre, I loved every minute of this movie. It enhanced the already prevailing fact: the brain is an incredibly complex bio-machine.The film - which integrated elements of mystery, deception, and crime - contained no loose ends, at least as far as I could see. I would like to stress the importance of letting the story and its characters take you through this dramatized script, and to shed all assumption and expectation, including 'Wolverine' moments from Jackman - sadly, some people can't see him as any other character.""Reminiscence"" was outstanding and unjustly underrated. The teams who worked on this project definitely obliged a 'storytelling risk', but they most certainly hit the right mark as far as I'm concerned.",Reminiscence

135,pinokiyo,"Exposition Galore. Bad pacing, rushed romance, cliche, predictable.",5,22 August 2021,"I thought the most basic thing about screenwriting is that you need to SHOW rather than TELL.This movie is like the biggest prime example failure of worst expositions ever. It's comical how Hugh Jackman talks through all the ""twists"" -- that it's not dramatic at all where the director intended to be.If you're expecting Inception, you will be HIGHLY disappointed. There is no real hook to grab you into the story or mind shocking twists, thrilling action in this movie like Inception or Minority Report had.In fact, all the action/fight scenes in this movie is the most generic boring scenes that just drag the movie down even more.The pacing is the worst about this film. The romance is so rushed, mostly lust, it's just not believable at all why Hugh Jackman is so obsessed with the girl. Even in the end, the ""twist"" with the romance is still silly and unbelievable.And when you think the plot is about Hugh Jackman trying to find the girl, the story becomes extremely convoluted with boring side story about a mob boss/district attorney case/drug dealer, and bunch of other characters start getting thrown in there that you can really care less about; that's why a lot of people will lose interest immediately.I mean, in the end you realize why you have to care about these other characters, but as a first time viewing experience, the pacing just drags and you won't be invested in it.The characters/dialoges/acting are so cheesy, especially Daniel Wu's character throwing in Chinese words with English. A lot of cheesy scenes like sparing the life because ""oh you served in the military too? Yeah, respect brother, so I'll let you live, even though my boss told me to kill you."" scenes. The girl's action is just irrational and a plothole too just to drive the story to be ""dramatic.""If you like Greek Mythology, the concept is similar to the story of Orpheus and Eurydice; the ending can be interpreted similarly to Inception whether it is a happy or sad. While it has an interesting idea, I thought the whole execution, dialogue/editing/acting/action was underwhelming.Inception is like 30 minutes longer than this movie, yet it feels much faster; watching Inception 3 times in a row will probably feel faster than watching this film one time. This movie definitely feels more like a stream quality/TV-Movie than big budget blockbuster Inception theatrical movie.A lot of similar movies like Deja Vu, The Final Cut (starring Robin Williams), Minority Report, Artificial Intelligence... etc.",Reminiscence
136,eve_dolluk,Contrived Neo Noir Sci Fi,5,21 August 2021,"Hmmmm what can i say, visually this film is pretty good, the style and texture are great and the painting of a future world succumbed by the Oceans are done well.The concept is an interesting one as well, The ability to relive memories again, although some memories can hold dark secrets.So why only a 5 out of 10....It uses a lot of Voiceover similar to detective films of the actual Noir Era but provide supposition more so than inner thoughts. As others have pointed out similar to Bladerunner before they were removed due to them being jarring.Flashbacks !!!, due to the nature of the concept reliving memories through flashback scenes is rife and the whole idea of the story., a detective movie through memory flashbacks.Dialogue.... The film suffers from pretty poor Dialogue, dated dialogue often wooden or mundane but at times laughable. The performances are however pretty good so kudos to the actors involvedVoiceover and Flashbacks !! Never a great thing in film making.That being said if there was a deeper more interesting story here it may have worked better but overall the story is bland with many missed opportunities for something of greater scope.Overall Reminiscence is a rather contrived movie leading to a mundane resolution pieced together in a disjointed fashion lacking flow and suffering from poor pacing. For a mystery it also lacks much mystery, it lacks the meat on its bones to allow the viewer to think or get involved.I am not sure if there was combination of rushed writing or lack of filming schedule due to covid or not. Poor editing maybe but the film falls very flat very quickly and never gets going again.Its a shame is I like this type of film, Film Noir, Detective mysteries, I probably marked it higher than it should have been due to this.A generous 5 out of 10 mainly for the visual experience.",Reminiscence

If the words can't hold a scene on their own, edit the damned words.This is what happens when the director part of the director/writer role realises that the writer half of the equation has been an indulgent ass and tries to edit the scene to be interesting instead of editing the dialogue to be on point.A lot of this is like that. It's quite a talky film with not very much of interest to say, and an awful lot of what it does say is terribly corny. That it's all delivered by a patchwork of two dimensional 'types' that have been assigned plot points instead of personality makes the whole enterprise feel rote rather than real - you can't imagine any character doing anything other than what they've been programmed to do.Jackman does his best as a dishevelled private eye (in everything but name) trying to find a mysterious femme fatale/chanteuse who disappears from his life faster than she entered - Rebecca Ferguson must be first on the cast list for anyone who needs someone to play a character who is confidently smug about how attractive they are and can talk at the same time.Newton plays his hard as nails colleague who looks out for him, a jaded guardian angel loyal to a fault. At least she's not given the quiptastic and cringe-worthy dialogue that made the irrepressible and cool AF Maeve so insufferable and dull in S2 of Westworld. Here, her character is just dull.It's all very hokey and pulpy and uninspired while desperately trying to be clever and relevant.

From the first act the things that mostly catch our eyes are the very performance of the two leads Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson. With every turn and twist they shape their performance in such a good way that it gives us a good feel and also makes us sit tight through the entire presentation. The flow of the story is quite interesting in the first act, where in the second and third act it kinda gets predictable from time to time but the suspense of the film grabs you in and doesn't let you get bored. Screenplay is as good as it can be for this film and so is the direction. The main thing that works as a big advantage and also as a disadvantage is the one single suspense that will tingle you throughout the movie. It will make you sit on your seat and enjoy the movie but it will also make you wanna skip to the very end to get the answers.

156,blackoutH,A missed opportunity,5,10 September 2021,"A strong concept, a dystopian future is depicted yet it is not so distant from our future reality, strong performances from the main actors and amazing visual effects - however the movie still falls short.It has the same problem as so many other Sci-Fi movies with an original idea, they focus more on generic over used plots rather than get more deep into the consequences of this new technology, how did it came to exist in the first place and what is its impact.For Reminiscence, we are set in a not so distant future where the sea levels rose placing cities partially under water, people use this technology that allows them to relive old memories since their future doesn't seem so bright, presenting it like this sounds like a candidate for a great flick, however they choose to leave us at that - zero development on the implications of the technology, how is society addressing their issues after such a catastrophe, any other interesting path they could go they ignored, instead they focus on Hugh Jackman's crush and the unjustified obsession he develops by someone who he shared a couple minutes of scree time.And that's about it, a generic action / thriller movie that happens to be set in the future with some cool technology, so it's a complete missed opportunity.Still, the performances are as good as you would expect and the visuals are indeed well made, let's hope Lisa Joy continues to improve her work, since her other project Westworld managed to impress me (at least the first 2 seasons, we don't' talk about the third one!)",Reminiscence

Movie takes place in the near future with a backdrop of global warming being ever-present. That story-line takes up none of the movie however flooding / glacial sea rise -- whatever you want to call it - is a stark and interesting backdrop throughout the film.

Its like watching a pop video strung out for ninety minutes.A talented bunch of actors aren't given much to do and so you (I) didn't care a bit about any of them, the plot seemed really kind of silly and a mixture of films about this kind of thing you've seen before.In a nutshell, unoriginal and a poorly told story.If you want a modern take on film noir maybe check out Gotham/The Dead Can't Lie, which features this films main musical number, or if you want a good film with the sci fi memory thing then Strange Days has the same central ideas of this, but is also a well made film with interesting characters and a better plot.",Reminiscence
162,axapvov,Bonus points for trying,5,20 August 2021,"This movie tries to put an old noir feeling into a new setting, more relevant to today's fears, an overflooded, overheated, overnostalgic place. It's very welcome to slowly be getting over the postapocalyptic cyberpunky phase.Blade Runner it is not but it benefits from the sort of exhaustive planning to be expected from anything associated with the name Nolan. Good things here and there add up and at a certain point you can't even care if the plot is interesting or not, it's just cool to watch.Not a fan of Hugh Jackman, he's like a bad version of Clive Owen rebuilt for the ladies. Rebeca Ferguson manages to overact more than he does, which is some accomplishment. The rest of the cast makes up for those two, thankfully, whenever they can. I liked Thandiwe Newton a lot, Cliff Curtis and Daniel Wu are great too, the whole supporting cast is good.There's a lack of confidence in the story. At some point you might get lost about the plot and the movie seems to be answering ""it's ok, we don't care either, we just liked the setting"".

181,guskeller,Ambitious but bites off more than it can chew,7,27 August 2021,"Reminiscence is surprisingly ambitious, but because it bites off more than it can chew, it is occasionally corny. Set in a dystopian future and stylized like a nostalgic film noir, Reminiscence has a retro-futuristic design that is perfect in theory but let down in execution. Unfortunately, the world-building is grander than the effects are able to support, undercutting the overall feel of the movie. The writing is another good example of this because it does massive world-building, introduces a lot of concepts that are both interesting and deep, and even delivers a classic noir mystery. However, throughout the script there are bits of dialogue, devices, and settings that are cliché enough to disrupt immersion.Yet, despite its flaws, Reminiscence is held together by its solid technical attributes and strong acting. Throughout this film, there are memorable cinematic images, interesting musical choices, elevating sound, and very good performances from Hugh Jackman and Thandiwe Newton (who always seems to be one of the best parts of whatever she is in). It may not be a seamless classic, but Reminiscence is actually pretty good. Overall, there is definitely enough going on here to forgive its shortcomings and please audiences.Writing: 7/10

Some will ask, well can you just judge the production based on its artistic merits? And I will answer with a resounding NOT POSSIBLE. In the 80s yes; 90s ok; in the early 2000s at times maybe; but definitely NOT NOW! In this day and age so much of what we see and hear is laced with some poisonous form of propaganda tethered to some nefarious 'Agenda'. Hollywood is promoting a kill-or-be-killed outlook for incoming generations (this was PG13) while having them resign themselves to futility and hopelessness vis a vis climate change ipso facto - a vacuous term to be sure. Of course the climate is changing! We've had several ice ages; however this one, will have been induced by man, and not haphazardly or through negligence; but by the satanic deliberation of those who wish an end to civilization. Consider researching Ionospheric heaters.I cannot overstate the damage this movie will affect on our wayward zeitgeist.

It is also very reminiscent of a film noir style of mystery.The movie is full of exposition, which although usually bothers me a lot, I was fine with for the most part. But it is a thing and it did heavily impact aspects like the world building, where we kept being told how it works instead of being shown more.Amongst the overly romanticised portrayal of their relationship and the over-reliance on exposition, what bothered me was some of the dialog. Quite often they would launch themselves into long monologues overflowing with tropes and metaphors. Every important character had at least one of those, with some parts being repeated.

It sounds promising at first. However this kind of idea requires some deeper style. Memories should only be seen as is, from the POV of a person. But this one tries to be smarter by using 3rd person view angles all the time. Finally memories look like perfectly filmed hollywood productions with perfect camera angles. This was enough for me to get distracted but althogether with clumsy protagonist and weak script, it made finishing the movie really difficult. This kind of sci-fi project requies a deep imagination, storyline and unique style. Unfortunately writer(s) have none of them except budget.",Reminiscence

It has all t he elements of a good film, but you can't help but feel that it really needed a good script editor and possibly an even better film editor.If this hadn't had the cast (hey, it's Rona-time), it'd be straight on Sy-Fy.It has too many elements, too many influences, too much throwbacking and little or no originality.It is littered with Bladerunner references, but has tried (and failed) to take it up a notch or three. The plot is deliberately confusing and one can't help but think that this is made to impress a certain somebody.If you have a spare two hours to burn, give it a go... But chances are, you'll not really remember much of it.One star for Hugh Jackman though - but even he can't save this from drowning in a pool of it's own pretentiousness.Quite simply put, there are faaaaaaaar better films out there to sink your teeth into that won't make you wish you hadn't.If you can spot the Bladerunner references, you'll laugh so hard that you'll realise that this is all makeup and no foundation.And as for the voiceover.... less said about that the better the dove will be.This almost feels like it was a script given to Christopher Nolan, which he tossed in the bin, only for someone to pick it back out and un-crumple it.",Reminiscence

Hugh Jackman's should-be engaging is really the only redeeming quality of the movie, and I saw should-be because this film is not engaging in any sense of the word. The world of the movie is so disjointed, putting memory, crime, and post-climate change flooded cities together in a hammy mesh of ideas that feel pulled from somewhere else. The movie is focused on being a crime drama, but unfortunately there is neither witty storytelling, tense mystery solving, or thrilling action and the center of the story, but rather boring romance scenes that are so flimsily constructed and so out of context you quickly lose any care you could have. When there is action in the movie, it is some of the boring action ever conceived, one just simply being characters standing behind poles while bullet holes appear in said poles. The world building feels incomplete and for the parts of the world we do learn about (through some of the most monotonous exposition to ever come from a human mouth), sound either too cliche and too random and have virtually nothing to do with the story expect for to extend the runtime. The visuals are so plain, yet the film feels although it wants you to think they are sweeping, when literally the ""dazzling"" set pieces are nothing more than everyday objects surrounded by water.

Now, he and his current girlfriend must work together to find out about the mystery of her disappearance by using their equipment.Reminiscence is another one of those movies that I really wanted to like. I was looking forward to it because it looked like an original sci-fi film trying to create some thought-provoking ideas while having some exciting action. I really like Hugh Jackman and I wanted to see him in a new film. However, several of these films have been disappointing... and unfortunately, this one gets added to that list.The best way to describe Reminiscence is that it is the movie equivalent to that video game that is so confusing that you need a guide figure out what to do and what is happening. What people complained about Tenet being too confusing is exactly how I felt about this. This is a movie that has plenty of ambition in its story and even some interesting world building. The movie is a crap sack world with the perfect tool of escapism that could be used to make this a sci-fi horror film. Just imagine, a movie where the memories can either trap you in a world of illusion or trigger your low points again to make you freak out. That would have been better than what we got.Instead, it is a very average thriller with a solid performance from Hugh Jackman and a convoluted story. It focuses on Nick's relationship with Mae, but it seems to shift from past and present so frequently, that it can be hard to tell what is going on. This is especially the case when Nick is confronting people who know about her disappearance and after the confrontations, we just from past to present again. The pacing is the biggest issue. It feels like the movie jumps from time period to time period. The third act is when the movie finally finds its footing and there are some thrilling moments with a solid climax and ending, but it is hard to let the confusion of the first two acts go. It also felt like the movie did not explore its premise enough and instead focusing on Nick's weird relationship with Mae. It feels so awkward and rushed. It does not help that Mae is a pretty uninteresting character. The story is a let down for sure, even with the third act and solid world.The performances are fine. None of them are stand outs, but they get the job done. Hugh Jackman does solid work as Nick and he shows some emotional expressions when dealing with Mae. The other notable performance was from Cliff Curtis. At first, his performance is nothing special, but his character is put through a horrific torture scene and it stands out as one of the most brutal scenes I have seen all year. There is also Rebecca Ferguson as Mae and honestly, she did not do much for me. She is a lovely woman and I am sure that she is better in other roles, but this character gives her hardly anything to work with. She just fell flat, but I think it is more on the script than her. Thawndie Newton as Emily is fine, but her character feels so underdeveloped, that I had little to no interest in what would happen with her. Thandiwe Newton's character is such a misopportunity because she could have been a great supporting character, but she is shoved to the side for Mae. The cast is good but the characters are not.Reminiscence has some nice technical aspects at least. The scenery is beautiful, even with a destroyed Miami. The cinematography is stunning with several shots where I thought, ""how did they do that?"" Particularly, a shot underwater heading toward the light and a very clever reflective first-person knockout. The action beats are well-shot and edited. They can even be intense at times. The musical score certainly has its haunting moments and the song that plays during the moment that the credits roll is soothing to my ears.Reminiscence is not awful, but it is more confusing than intriguing. This movie just goes to show that originality does not equal quality. It is hard to recommend this movie because it lacks the dynamic execution of concepts other sci-fi films while coming off smarter than it actually is. However, there is some value, originality and ambition here. There is a good movie buried underneath the confusion. I just wish that the final product was better than what we got.",Reminiscence

It was an emotional love story but due to the heavy effects, CGI, it looks stale and artificial.Watch some Abbas Kiarastomi, Roman Polanski, Sidney Lumet, David Lean kind of cinema, where stories were from present and earth, not from some un-discovered apocalyptic world.",Reminiscence

However, it plays out more like someone is reading a novel and we're watching a reenactment of it. For how much the movie dragged, the main plot points (and even the love story) felt rushed. As in, maybe explain the floods and the wars a little more..? The action sequences seemed out of place too and the dialogue wanted to be more inspiring than it actually was.I admire the attempt to rekindle the on-screen chemistry of Rebecca Ferguson and Hugh Jackman from The Greatest Showman, but sadly not even the constant smolder of someone as gorgeous as Ferguson could keep this movie afloat.

I've watched more thrilling Star Trek ""Holodeck"" stories than this.They also played it nice and safe, staying in the warm middle of the culture flock, believing all the politically correct narratives, right down to the bone;-That is, any creative team which believes in the Global Warming narrative so hard that they'll base an entire world-build on its precepts is by default going to be too mediocre in the awareness and knowledge department to be able to create anything more than mediocrity.This was made by people who are had by ideas, not the other way around.Still, I gave this a 6 out of 10 because.., it was competent if slow. It almost looked great. If you are ignorant in key subject areas. (Some of the water effects indicated a terrible lack of understanding about the destructive effects of salt water and wave action. Buildings aren't going stay standing with their bottom three floors submerged, and no, dykes don't work like that. If you can't figure that stuff out, and you're too oblivious to hire somebody who can direct your production team, then you're probably oblivious about just.., all kinds of things.)And the ending...That was stupid and nihilistic and childish. You lose a star for making me sit through the whole film just to be fed that ending.But otherwise.., it was a pretty good photocopy of a photocopy of a Dashiel Hammett novel made by a young person without enough clues or real experience in life.

There is also design, special effects, score and soundtrack, cinematography, atmosphere, acting and dialogue. It is a rare movie that fires on all cylinders. One of those films to me is the original BLADERUNNER. REMINISCENCE has some of what made BLADERUNNER an unforgettable action/futurist film. Miami has replaced Los Angeles, and its streets-turned-canals from rising sea levels is a terrific visual. Throughout the film are wonderful sets of a decrepit future. Director Lisa Joy must also be a fan of the original BLADERUNNER release, by employing the noir voiceover, a visual of an ascending dove and most obviously the overall production.The opening scene has an excellent musical background. But the score weakens as the film goes on. I wonder if different composers were employed for different parts of the film?The plot I'll admit is weak. Two weeks after seeing it, I could barely remember what it was about. In an ironic way, this make it a film better seen at a movie theater than on a small screen.",Reminiscence

246,Darvener,Review without spoilers,3,18 August 2021,"Movie Reminiscence was created under director and writer Lisa Joy with a Hollywood star in the main role Hugh Jackman. After the success of Westworld Lisa Joy decided to create her first movie under the FilmNation Entertainment production company and under Warner Bros. Distribution.Movie is about a man named Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) who is a private investigator who reconnects all forgotten memories through a tank of a quarter filled and a computer where you must insert a card and then set volts. The computer with a combination of a tank and some sort of hat will produce a hologram visual memory. One night will come to his place where he is doing these holograms Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) clothed with a noir looking dress. She came to his place to remember where she have her apartment keys. In the day they get acquainted and they are now a couple. The plot is that he wants to find his girlfriend with the name Mae (Rebecca Ferguson), who disappeared overnight. If there had not been half a city underwater and a reminiscence machine, it would be a cliché story.Movie accompanies us with a plot and during the first shootout you will start to know that the script isn't as good as the trailer told us. During the movie you will discover many logic holes which Lisa Joy left in the script. The director (Lisa Joy) left in the movie actors who have performances on average except for Hugh Jackman, Rebecca Ferguson and Thandie Newton. The execution of transitions between real world and reminiscence vision is weird and strange. It feels like she had forgotten her experiences from Westworld during shooting the movie.Despite all the criticism you can find a few good things in the movie. Hugh Jackman in the role of Nick Bannister have a perfect performance and the role was created for him. Camera was very good, but there were some problems with granulation. The VFX in this movie is very well crafted. One good thing which is in the script is the concept. Concept is very good and original but the execution is terrible.This movie does not deserve a higher rating than 3/10 (in percentage 25%).",Reminiscence

It had a few action scenes but never really even took off. Not even Jackman, who I have been rooting for should have saved this movie, or Ferguson and Newton could save this movie.

Then innumerable TV and movies have memory manipulation stories like ""Total Recall"", ""Altered Carbon"", ""The Seventh Day""...The climate change effect of a permanently flooded Miami is simply a background, except that it suggests a late 21st Century date (albeit with anachronistic 2020 cars, vehicles etc.). However, there is no comment about climate change.The murder-mystery plot is a bit too complex to be realistic; except to a paranoid's self-flagellating psyche of ""conspiracy"" in every detail or thought.The two main actors are accomplished, Thandie Newton (very underutilized actress), and Hugh Jackman.

255,chiefjournalist,The Nolan Angle... Falls Flat Again,6,22 August 2021,"One of the producers on this film is Jonathan Nolan; brother and sometimes collaborator with his brother Christopher Nolan. And although he's not been given any screen credit for the script on this movie it; I'm betting that his marriage to the film director Lisa Joy allowed both Jonathan and Christopher Considerable input to the script development and the eventual shape of the finished project. (From this point forward there are some mild spoilers.)Like most Nolan films this movie deals with time shifting and memories. Hugh Jackman runs a memory clinic in the futuristic sunken/water logged Miami. He and his Army Buddy (Thandiwe Newton) help their customers do everything from find lost keys to reliving the actual feeling of being held in the arms of their lover. The technology is amazing and allows Jackman & Newton to guide their customer through the catacombs of memories in their mind and view it as a 3D representation and record a legal document for posterity. They are licensed by the state and also are called upon by local prosecutors to recover memories that could prove the guilt or innocence of criminal suspects.Against this backdrop Rebecca Ferguson plays a fem-fatale who's featured presence in the movie is all too short. She drop's into Jackman's life; he falls for her and the she's gone as quick as she appeared. Leading him to spend the rest of the film try to find her. For me this is where the movie began to go off the rails. The hunt begins a series of disjointed sequences -- including;

265,syd9907,Journey into Confusion and Absurdity,2,20 August 2021,"Where does one begin with ""Reminiscence"", which is on HBO Max and in theaters. This film had so much potential, especially with the caliber of actors like Hugh Jackman, Thandiwe Newton and Rebecca Ferguson, and no matter how much they tried, they couldn't make this film and the laughable dialogue come alive. Everything that could wrong did in this film....horribly wrong. It's slow, confusing, it never finds it footing and just barrels along like a runaway train that you know will eventually crash and burn.Reminiscence has the look of a film noir and Blade Runner comes to mind, coupled with the mind-bending of Inception and Strange Days. However, all three films did it better.We have climate change flooding Miami and forcing people to move about at night to avoid the blistering heat during the day, boating among buildings while dealing with fallout from an unspecified war. The war is mentioned a million times, yet we really don't know much about it and that's truly a missed opportunity. We have the wounded soul in Jackman desperately trying to find the mysterious woman (Ferguson) who left an indelible print on his psyche. So he keeps going into his device that allows people to recover and vividly relive old memories, offering a comforting glimpse of better times to those experiencing this new Hellish reality. The only thing I can say is NO to all of it.And Thandiwe Newton (Westworld) is completely wasted in this film as Jackman's partner and fellow veteran, though in this journey into absurdity, she's actually the brightest spot in the entire film. Don't waste your time with Reminiscence, there's much better options if you like this genre of film. Reminiscence cost $68 million to make and if this film get's a 4th of that budget back, it'll be a miracle and I'm being generous.",Reminiscence

If the part had been played by a female the Metoo crowd would have been shrieking their displeasure, as a man I too cried No More for heavens sake.With possibly the worst fight scene ever in any film, things start low and get worse. You can visibly cringe as the two protagonists wait for the other to grapple with them before exchanging laughably contrived blows. Again poor direction let's everything stumble.Hard to see anyone coming out of this with any credit, really a waste of time and money, you can't include effort as there seems to have been very little of that here.Any sort of storyline or plot is very quickly lost through lack of control and feeble acting.

277,gpcheng87,Total Recall - Book on Tape,4,1 September 2021,"Was looking forward to this - it's a shame because it has a great cast and had potential.Movie is basically Hugh Jackman narrating... the entire time. He even states things that are happening while we're watching him watching the moments happen (i.e. ""You saved him."" That alone shouldn't be a spoiler, but you'll know what I mean when you get there/hear it). You can listen to this movie with your eyes closed and not miss a thing - which is the opposite of what a movie is supposed to be.The movie also uses this narration to skip all the parts that should have been shown/expanded on in favor of ""cooler"" scenes that really don't need a ton of show-and-tell; for example we see people use the machine way too many times - we know how it works after the first 3. Instead, it would have been much more interesting to show how/why the floods came, how quickly the water is rising, and how that affects the current landcape (jobs, rich poor, pricew, economy...etc.) For example, Rebecca Ferguson's character is basically a lounge singer at a seedy bar, but her apartment is pretty great compared to how bad things are supposed to be in this post-apocalyptic world... complete with a roof and view. Is... she rich? We don't know. Jackman's character seems better off than she is, but he and Thandie Newton's characters argue about money from the get go.Verdict: Slow, small world, simple static characters, predictable.",Reminiscence

And then the memory tub contraption was a bit reminiscent of Inception, so it made sense to get braced for some trickeration. Not sure what to trust, right? That could be a good thing, actually, could make for a certain suspense. Except, in this film, it doesn't. Good cast members provided a ray of hope, but all sorts of things quickly seemed to make no sense, and there wasn't enough development of character to make it emotionally investable to continue. I reminded myself that I never made it through my first viewing of Inception (then revisited it several times later, as it became one of my favorite films). But that was back when I was still drinking, and literally passed out on the couch. Now, after almost a decade of sobriety, I was dozing off on Reminiscence with nothing stronger than a diet soft drink on the table.

What are the chances people in the distant future talk in film noir 1920's cadences. Bad direction? It's most likely a combination of all three. The premise is at best mildly intriguing - the noir moodiness is poorly executed. At times it feels at its best it's a video game plot. Thandie Newtons characters intentions don't make sense-or at least she doesn't have enough of a back story to warrant it. There's a lot of problems and not enough good moments to even it out.

Meanwhile, the rest of the cast are as flat and redundant as the film's breached New Orleans flood defences. The only saving graces are some decent apocalyptic vistas and acceptable special effects, but the bad script and dull screenplay soon wash all this initial promise away.In summation this is a total big studio (Warner) washout and it really does question whether tinseltown has run out of ideas and indeed the 'talent' it takes to realise them.

Night Shyamalan an permanent onanistic state we watch the story for lack of a better word unfold and it hurts so much to suffer through it.By the end we find out that Mae had killed herself to make sure she could finish her character arc from con artist/junkie to mother/ideal woman, Thandiwe Newton's talents are completely wasted by turning her into the girl that always loved Nick but couldn't, everyone who is a bad guy has been killed or was too afraid to kill themselves, and our beloved Nick was allowed to slip into a permanent coma to live out his fantasy life with Mae.Lisa Joy has done some amazing writing in the past between Westworld, Burn Notice, and Pushing Daisies but this movie is like every horrid trope pushed into 2 hours of screen time and Hugh got enough deus ex machinas in this film that he receives no more for the rest of his acting career.But end of the day, it really just felt like Hugh, Rebecca and Thandiwe were just there to pick up a pay check.I was going to give the movie 4 out of 10, but even the cinematography is just...bleh.

Then follows 90 minutes of narrated cliche after cliche reminiscent (no pun intended) of every narrated detective movie or show you've ever seen. The characters are one-dimensional and utterly boring. The scenes are dry and lack 'presence' (no one is putting any feeling in any of it). And the story is painfully predictable (you can see the next thing coming 5 minutes before it does, while the thing just drags on and on).The premise of the movie itself (being able to relive memories) leans on a few assumptions about the human mind which contradict science (might not bother everyone, but it bothers me, since I like science fiction not to straightly contradict established science too blatantly).Dull.

So of course I am highly disappointed that this is so poorly created and time consuming. Just because you can afford to make a film doesn't mean you should. This is poorly written and badly executed. I didn't finish as it was either made for those with the brain capacity of a boiled peanut that are easily engaged in movies or people that are getting paid to say nice things that are not true.

The rich live on elevated ground while the less fortunate have to swim to work. If that wasn't bad enough extreme temperatures mean everyone lives a dusk-till-dawn existence.On the plus side, Nick Bannister, played by Hugh Jackman runs a service where it is now possible to relive your memories in 3D. Handy for spending time with passed away relatives or finding lost car keys. But when the mysterious woman he's been seeing disappears without trace Bannister uses the technology on himself to piece together what happened.I made the mistake of getting excited about this movie.

Unfortunately, Reminiscence just doesn't deliver.It was brought to us by the same guys that made Westworld, a slick and thought provoking sci-fi tv show. In Reminisce, however, something went wrong.

I had zero expectations when I hit play - didn't watch a trailer or read anything about it beforehand - just figured most of my picks for the past week had been oldies and wanted to catch something new. I found it slow paced but the mystery plot was well done and the characters were good.The graphics for this movie are amazingly done (despite what the CGI haters claim).They definitely could have explored different aspects of this story and world in which it takes place, but that wasn't what the film was about and the little pieces we got seemed to be just filler for that main storyline.Personally I wish they would have sped up the speed of the main story and included more history, action and drama but the story they wanted to tell (tragic romance) was spot on and the mystery and sci-fi are solid.After giving it some consideration, they deserve the 10 stars. Glad I was able to catch this on HBO Max due to the slow pacing but I imagine the rich and surreal environments would be awesome to view on the big screen.I must not watch much in the romance/mystery category - I thought this was a pretty unique storyline - global warming with memory scanning and hologram capabilities, how the mystery plot was played out...

377,kdlprod75018,Missed the mark... Trapped between ghosts of 2046 and Westworld...,5,4 September 2021,"Throughout watching this movie, I was constantly reminded of two ghosts of feature for very different reasons... The first ghost is the 'Westworld' TV series obviously because of the director and her partnering producer, but also most importantly the second ghost is the movie '2046' by Hong-Kong art-house filmmaker Wong Kar Wai. I won't dwell on 'Westworld' as 'Reminiscence' is a very different movie from the aforementioned TV series, though it uses similar concepts of being in the future getting into someone's mind/brain and playing tricks within it, in this case, reliving someone's past memories in a post-apocalyptic climate changed world as opposed to living a journey in an amusement park in an AI dominated world for 'Westworld'. While I love 'Westworld' and how it works so effectively thanks to its episodic format which allows for multiple intrigues and real character development, 'Reminiscence' misses the mark as it is just too short of a fomat to really be able to blend action sequences with real character development and well Proustian reminiscences of time past. The nods to 2046 are a lot more subtle but none the less very much present throughout the movie. The miami neon signs and hotel roof settings are similar to those used in 2046 where Hong-Kong neon signs and Shanghai's 60s hotel rooftops are prominently featured, so was the casting of Daniel Wu & his deliberate dialect talk in Chinese & English which reminds you of the language format in 2046 somewhere lost between cantonese, chinese and japanese. Centrally, 2046 dealt with reminiscences of the past and the future from a central character avoiding his present life and missing the mark because of it, a character lost in a past love and longing for a dreamed fantasized love... In 'Reminiscence', we're dealing with the past only for Hugh Jackman's character but also in a way, the character is also longing for a future that will never happen, and we get a glimpse of it at the very end of the movie where Hugh Jackman's character muses about him and Rebecca Ferguson's character becoming Orpheus and Eurydice except living life right where they chose it to be, somewhere between past and future... in the middle.Alas, the middle road in arts never really gets you anywhere... or it leads you to a 5/10 movie rating overall as seems to be the case for this movie... While Westworld's darkly robotic/AI/big data world centered around many lead characters all playing a part in the grander story, 'Reminiscence' relies solely on Hugh Jackman's character and performance... which was fine but never really awesome... Rebecca Ferguson & Thandiwe Newton are just second fiddle to it all... You never really experience much of any kind of action thriller suspense either... as the plot just lacks any kind of real stakes... yeah, he longs for a woman who has disappeared and wants to find out where she is and what happened to her... but it's so short of a movie and really in the end, the whole reason why was just not engaging enough because we just never really got exposed to the supporting characters...
While 2046 was a highly sensual and emotional experience of the mind with exquisite filmmaking, 'Reminiscence' feels just very blend and forced... There is just little time and talk allowed as the plot needs to move along if the movie is to be a 2-hour experience.The one redeeming dimension of the movie is the set design, where we are engulfed in lush tapestry of post-apocalyptic Miami city and ocean mixed together.Unfortunately, whether it was deliberate or not, probably not for lack of desire from the director/producers but because of pressures from the studios, this movie ended up being a muddled feature trapped between genres... part love story, part sci-fi intrigue, part art house movie... never really touching, or entrancing, or thrilling enough... muddled in the muddy waters of the urban oceanic world it's supposed to be set in... a pity really... Had they really pushed the 2046 angle, they probably could have ended up with a really good movie albeit very different but at least, it would have not been half-boring, half-interesting as it is... Had they pushed the waterworld angle and intrigue, it could have been something on par with Westworld in a short format... Alas, the producers just stayed right in the middle and well missed the mark.. Too bad...",Reminiscence

Some plots give me the feels where the actors discussed the things that happened which they already know just for the sake of explanation to the audience. Lastly, the directing was like something heavily inspired by Nolan's Inception but couldn't just hit the level because the budget is limited or the production was not carefully executed enough. I would give it a 6.5 as Hugh Jackman's performance was exceptional in this one and there are some plots I really appreciate.",Reminiscence

The lack of mold everywhere).Hugh Jackman plays ""protagonist with dubious American accent"" who is paid to peer into people's memories and gets wrapped up in the most boilerplate noir plotline possible, with drinking and a femme fatale and hard-boiled lines and fist fights. The spoilers don't even matter once you know that and have even a cursory understanding of cinematic tropes in noir and later-day sci-fi.I will say exactly this: it was adequate, inoffensive late-August entertainment that's at least more tolerable than most streaming platforms' originals, less stupid and insulting than The Tomorrow War, but in no way would I have ever gone to see it in a theater or paid for it beyond its inclusion with HBO Max.

This is especially harmful toward the movie's main gimmick - the Reminiscence technology. The main character tells you that since the present (and future) are bleak, nostalgia has become a way of life but you don't see that in the movie.

MILD spoilers ahead,8,20 August 2021,"While I kind of agree with some users mention of how the setting, a possible near future where oceans have flooded Miami, seems unnecessary I do feel that it doesn't take away from the main idea here. I also see how it adds to the story in some ways..As someone who gets lost in memories of better times now and again, I can totally see a future where people would pay to experience some of their best memories in a more complete way. To me, this movie is a perfect blend of a mystery and love story. Maybe it's because I'm a man, but I related to Hugh Jackman's character 100%. I felt his performance really brought out the desperation, confusion, and need to solve the mystery to find Mae. Maybe it's also because I think Rebecca Ferguson is one of the prettiest women out there, but I related to his head over heels reaction to her. It made me
reminisce (reference intended!) of past experiences in my own life. I felt that:all characters were believable
the special effects were well done
the setting brought about a despair
And that the pacing was perfect..I did take away small points because I feel like this may have borrowed her idea but can't remember exactly what movie it reminded me of. I also thought it would've been cool to maybe add a memory or two of the flooding and further examine the effect it had on society, as opposed to a Hugh Jackman voiceover.

429,rosebudfr,JOYlessness,4,23 August 2021,"I was initially looking forward to this flick, enjoying Lisa Joy's WESTWORLD (seemingly half the cast makes a cameo) and the premise behind this movie. Alas, the trailer damped my enthusiasm, and the actual film completely cured me of any kind of remaining JOYfulness (haha).Granted, Chandler-esque plotting is always intricate and serpentine, but calling the plot here convoluted doesn't begin to express the utter confusion wreaking havoc in this story - way too many characters only glimpsed here and there but who turn out to be central to the story (""who was that again??""), underdeveloped protagonist (Why exactly does he behave the crazy way he does? Why again does he care so much about that woman??), too many chance encounters and convenient coincidences (*lazy writing* alert), way too much drama, absurd twists and dei ex machina, etc. Most everything looks and sounds fake in this movie, which in WESTWORLD is the whole point but here drags the whole thing down toward the creative abyss.I agree with other reviewers saying this is typical episodic writing - this film is one long list of barely related episodes the necessity of which is questionable to say the least (e.g. The whole New Orleans passage). Likewise, way too many side characters are calling for our sympathy and empathy whereas we barely remember who they are - this should have been a miniseries and then we could have - perhaps - cared. It could also have helped a movie which doesn't know what it wants to be - a noir crime thriller, a romance, an action flick? In BLADE RUNNER, this patchwork of genres actually works, but then that movie had a very simple and straightforward story and focused zen-like on more important stuff.That is perhaps the worst offense this film is guilty of. This being science fiction, worldbuilding is supposed to have some kind of importance, but is treated here carelessly. We're told global warming makes days unlivable outside, but we never see anyone even perspiring, or any AC units chugging away on windows. We're shown at the beginning and ending some half-hearted rioting, but never shown or told anything else about the social situation in the course of the film, never really shown (just told through an exposition-heavy voiceover) how precarious life is in this bleak future. Instead, characters keeping referring to some past war that has strictly nothing to do with anything and is just typical of an attention-span challenged plot that doesn't know how to focus.You'd think a half-drowned Miami would be a nice setting for a noir, James Lee Burke-like (aaaaah, HEAVEN'S PRISONERS...) story, but this film has zero atmosphere. Outside shots feel like cheap cardboard sets, clubs feel like any basic TV series joint, you hardly ever see the populace, what they look like, what their lives have been reduced to, what it feels like to replace cars with boats, etc.Noir-ish cyberpunk scifi has given us some underrated gems, some even dealing with similar plots and themes (STRANGE DAYS anyone?), but this one will not be one of them.",Reminiscence

Thandie Newton's character has a surprise daughter to go reconnect with and made whole-have we been in Westworld all along? The actors and concept had promise...

He's a man who deals in memories in a reality people would prefer to forget.Haunted by his own memories of a woman he falls in love with, he uncovers a murder mystery with a confession of love unlike anything seen before.Will it warp your brain like Inception? Maybe not. But will it leave your mind unchanged? Only if you have a lack of imagination.Reuniting PT Barnum (Hugh Jackman) and Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) plus the magnificent Thandie Newton and the cast is simply unforgettable.",Reminiscence

No it isn't perfect but lets be honest no movies are anymore. At times it tends to drag but that doesn't make it a horrible movie.

It is definitely a quiet, thoughtful, slow burn of a movie. But it is absolutely worth watching. While viewing, I got essences of Blade Runner meets the Minority Report meets just a hint of Inception. Don't get me wrong; it is not nearly as good as any of these movies, but it takes you on a mind bending, dark, futuristic journey that has a resolution which worked for the overall feel of the story. I think the final scene was the weakest, being completely illogical and impossible. I think the build-up of some of the character's relationships were definitely rushed and felt incomplete, like some bad editing had stolen moments that would have allowed me to care more about the characters. There are also come completely unbelievable scenes which take away from the movie as a whole, but it is a futuristic fantasy, so who am I to judge? However, overall the movie is completely watchable, and entertaining in a quiet way and has some really beautiful scenes.

447,aserpentperplexed,Blade Runner with an Unhealthy Dose of Cheeeeese!,5,14 September 2021,"Clearly in some ways inspired by Blade Runner, in the sense that it is a Neo Noir film set in a not too distant dystopic future earth and has some interesting philosophical points to make. It's more like the original version of Blade Runner rather than the director's cut, in that there is an annoying voiceover narration from the protagonist (Hugh Jackman) which attempts to explain every single thing the movie should be telling us without narration. This voiceover has the same probably as the voiceover in the original versions of Blade Runner: SHOW DON'T TELL. A lot of symbolic significance to the various scenes that one should be able to glean from just watching the movie are explained to us by a Hugh Jackman narration as if we are kindergartners who haven't been taught what symbolism is yet.In this case, rather than the topic of what makes a person a person and reckoning with your own mortality, this movie has some points to make about memories, and how we revisit them (both literally and figuratively), and the addictiveness of living in the past. I would say that there's a message about Climate Change as well, but that mostly just informs the setting and while the concept is brought up multiple times the main plot of this movie would be identical if climate change hadn't flooded Florida.One could also make the argument that this movie is about drug addiction, both in that there are literal drugs being abused in the movie and this drug like memory device that enable people to be addicted to re-experiencing their past. However, I don't want to think about that too hard because if the memory tank is an addiction, then Hugh Jackman *spoilers* decided he wanted to overdose himself until he's dead, which I don't think is a very well-thought-out message when you deliberately and repeatedly go to the effort to compare the memory tank with a drug addiction.*End Spoiler""As you can see here, there are quite a few themes that the movie wanted to explore. Too many themes to fit into this movie! A lot of the pol would keep out attention.The dialogue is just CHEESE. And I'm not talking a good cheese, more like Casu Marzu.

No feelings, no attachment.The reminiscences (hum hum) of the Film Noir genre are here but they are dull and miss the intended immersion. Characters are too shallow and clean. Story is too gentle and weak. ""Noir"" is never reached during the movie, replaced by some preachy and pseudo-philosophical dialogues.Sci-fi background ? Once again, completely careless about science, especially for the real mechanisms around memory and the real consequences of massive floods.

However its funny because if a movie has above average exposition, people get mad but if it hasnt then people get mad for not understanding the movie.Anyway, apart from the plot, the cinematography is very good. I really liked the semi-post apocalyptic take of the world and congrats to the director for showing it to us both at close and from afar.The acting from the protagonists is also very good(especially Hugh Jackman is the highlight, with his powerful and emotional performance.

In general, those of us who love great movies, especially thrillers, are pretty bright. The biggest fault I have here is the way the script spoon fed lines and telegraphed SIGNIFICANT clues as well as red herrings. In the film, it is all about the details.The scenes of the memories are always significant are supposed to be giving all of us clues, and we - the audience - are watching along with Jackman and the others to try and figure out pertinent facts. So we are all on the edge of our seats, soaking in the details, and we don't need the actors to speak the obvious. The scene has WAY more impact if you just let it happen without showing it to us and then TELLING us what happened, after we have watched the scene and made our own conclusions.I don't want to be specific as I don't like to add spoilers but in this case, I will mention one specific scene (there are dozens of lines like this throughout the film which is why I am giving this such a low rating. I can overlook one or two boo-boos but it happens so much throughout I believe it had to almost be intentional by the writer.)In this scene, as it is playing out, a character drops her earring, looking back at the bldg, and when Hugh Jackman picks it up (as he is watching the memory play out) he actually audibly says ""The earring. She wanted me to find it."" Like it is some huge revelation. We just saw the scene and we KNOW she dropped it on purpose for him to find it. We don't need him to now say it as if we, are too stupid to grasp that. It is annoying and condescending. And the script is FULL of lines like that.So, as an escape, as a fun 2-hr diversion, it was ok, but it is definitely not a movie I would ever watch a second time, or many times, something I love to do when the script is brilliant.One reviewer said to stream it or wait for cable.

People always want a breath of fresh air and something different, and here comes something like this again and suddenly nobody likes it or thinks it's stupid. Apparently everyone expected a fast-paced action movie, but that's just not what the film is. It's part drama, crime and thriller in a sci-fi setting with a few creative ideas.For me, next to Cruella, Reminiscence is the best film of the year so far.The story is creative and exciting and the setting is refreshing and different for a change. The film is suspenseful and emotionally involving and most importantly, the film is twisty and consistent, especially with the ending. For those who find happy endings soft and cliché: watch this movie, because it doesn't have a happy ending and it is consistent and pulls this consistency hard. Great! The film takes its time with the story and the buildup, which I'm sure the impatient among us won't like. If you are looking for action, this is not the place for you. Those who like quiet dramas, thrillers and crime thrillers will be fine here.Hugh Jackman plays great, as do Rebecca Ferguson and Thandie Newton.I'm already looking forward to the second viewing, even if I know everything before then.

None of these things mean anything either other than the fact that people mention them.There's a 1930's gangster film inside a film set in a clock shop where the characters stand and wait to talk to Hugh Jackman several times as if they are NPC's in a video game.But really it's about lost love, and memories, and remembering memories and a kidnapped child for some reason.They could only afford 3 sets, so the whole movie basically takes place in the same room but also in memories.

Was this really the best they could put together? ... I maybe wouldn't have minded so much if I'd streamed it, but I went to the cinema and paid that extra money, so I REALLY feel like I've wasted it ....I could have got some new socks instead.I was already bored to tears by the dull story, bland set pieces and empty characters with zero chemistry, but when the ending happened it was like the final nail being whacked into the coffin, and I just sighed to myself in disbelief.I'd lost track of the amount of times my eyes had rolled throughout the film. I'd been so close to walking out numerous times from around the halfway point, but decided to be fair and see it till the end. I really wish I hadn't and gone with my gut instinct.There is a very slight glimmer of the potential for something mildly decent here, but literally almost nothing works. I didn't care in the slightest about what was going on or any of the characters.Rebecca Ferguson, I'm sorry to say, plays such an unlikable and uninteresting character that I desperately struggled to see why Hugh Jackman's character was SO obsessed with her; to the point where he dedicates his life to her from the SECOND she walks through the door... especially when he has Thandiwe Newton's character practically pouring over him the entire time they're together. How would he not have seen that?Again, I'm sorry, I like Thandiwe Newton, but she's supposed to be playing an alcoholic here. Apart from having drink in her hand during a few scenes, there's nothing to suggest she's this deeply tortured soul they make her out to be.Hugh Jackman plays a character so blindsided and naive that it's almost embarrassing. You'd expect his actions to come from a young teenager, not a middle aged adult.I could go on, but what's the point?The opening shot of the movie was quite nice. I'll leave it there.",Reminiscence

What was new was the idea of using technology to access memory. Was this film predictable? Yes, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining. It was also like watching a Christopher Nolan film.

The story flows too slowly to be able to enjoy the ride, and the direction fluctuates more than needed. I found a couple of dialogues that are almost the same as Peter Dinklage's Rememory, surely an influence to the writer.Again the visual effects are the best in the movie and the sequence of the last minutes seemed to wrap up the story well.

possibly because he has to read pearls of wisdom like
-I will never understand this woman completely -
or he is trying to comprehend the fact, that now men and women are get equally paid in the movies.Rebecca Fergusson masks her boredom much better, still she has to wear horrible clothes, that make her stiff,
which again is a shame, if we remember her performance from ,for example, Rogue Nation.Thandiwe doesn't even has to pretend to be engaged as she plays the character that is bored by nature and drinks plenty of colored water from a flask.I left the middle rate of the movie because of the actors worth watching despite all the flaws.I mean if you like to watch bored Thandiwe watching bored Hugh peeping at Rebecca of bored clothes.",Reminiscence

Because of the trailer and the vibe it gives, you may think so, however, after watching the movie, you cannot possibly compare them AT ALL.-The earth is apparently in a bad shape because global warming got to a very destructive point but you never learn the story of that.-Because the sun is too hot now, Nick (Hugh Jackman) says nobody goes out in the morning or afternoon anymore and every place works during night hours, but you can clearly see him and many others wander around and do chores during blatant daylight.Nick and Watts do this job of giving people a chance to revisit their old memories via a computer-type of looking machine. One day a woman (a gorgeous one on that) enters their store and well, you guessed it, our guy Nick falls in love with her.Becomes obsessed with her.Starts acting careless.Listens to no one and no advice.And this happens all the beginning of the movie so no spoilers, but you start to become less and less interested in the storyline because of how stupid the guy is not to be able to see BS that's right in front of him and he is a private invastigator, mind you.Me and my friend watched this at the cinema and paid for it but I wish I could get my money back 'cause it was a waste of my time.

That all we have in this world are our memories good or bad. It's what we choose to remember that makes our experience good or bad.There was a lot of truth spoken in this movie of human existence, that in life there is never such thing as a happy ending. Eventually every prince and princess must die, wether it be from the villain coming back and taking their vengeance on the hero/heroine, or maybe old age comes and takes one and then the other, regardless the important thing to remember is the fact that no one knows the greatness of the light until they've tasted the bitterness of the dark. That appreciation of the dark, will allow us to savor our moments in the light.That's where this movie takes you, on a journey thru the truth of all the stories we live, wether we choose to accept them as fiction or fantasy, and does so in a film noir style that has been missing from a lot of movies we see now-a-days. I highly recommend that when walking into this movie, leave your thoughts at the door and enjoy the movie for the psychology that brings up.

533,amichaelmanzella,"Really enjoyed this, the ""good"" reviews are correct",9,28 August 2021,"Seeing the previews for this I thought ""love the stars but doesn't look interesting."" Well, here I am sitting on a Friday looking for something to watch and it came upon this. Read the reviews and really looked at the positive reactions. I could not be happier that I decided to watch this.Who it's for:
-Those who like the stars. I love Rebecca Ferguson in all the roles I've seen her in (which admittedly is only like three or four now including this). I will say there were some feelings I had seeing her with Hugh Jackman in Greatest Showman. I thought they were great together. If you liked that movie interaction then you will absolutely love this.-Those who love a move that really caught them off guard... I liken this to the first time I saw Oblivion. That surprised me with the story and with the slow but action-ish edge of your seat love story. This movie gave me the same feelings. There wasn't a moment that I wasn't thinking that this was a good movie. As opposed to The Last Jedi when I knew it was crap 20 minutes in. Damn it hurts still.-Those who get 20 minutes in and already know they like it. If you are at all intrigued at that point you will like this movie. It's good. I don't disagree with the bad reviews, I don't think this is for everyone. If you get 20 minutes in and aren't intrigued then call an all stop and find something else to do.-Those who are reading reviews hoping this is a good movie. It's not just good. I almost never write reviews on here and I immediately took to writing as the credits rolled. Heck, I finished the credits at this point and already miss them. I don't care if that's lame. If you are hoping this is good then you are correct. If you aren't sure if this is good then you are also correct just not in my eyes you jerk.Look, I had my first drink at the start of this and my fourth drink by the end, and now I'm writing this. The story kept me hooked throughout. I even paused when getting another round which is rare. I love a good story here and there, movies that are edgy but have a good sci-fi but also love story with some mystery. I think of Oblivion and In Time (also love the stars of In Time) and how those impacted me. This is right there. If you are meh and looking for something mindless and ""fun"" look elsewhere. Mindless fun moves absolutely have their place and I love them. But, I'll refer to other positive reviews that got me to watch this: it had what it needs if you are in the right frame of mind and really enjoy these stars. Some reviews mention Momento and Inception which had me intrigued, but they aren't really applicable. This movie isn't like those, but I think reviewers were attempting to capture their thoughts and feelings at the end. In those cases, I would agree.If you are one the fence because of differing reviews then go with your gut. I did and couldn't be happier to have watched this. Ignore any typos in my review and don't let that influence your opinion. Grab a drink land watch this awesome movie.",Reminiscence

544,rangerxus,Reminiscing the days when studios released good movies,5,21 August 2021,"A total failed attempt at film noir. All the elements were there: a masuline gruffy leading man narrating the movie (Jackman), a loyal sidekick (Newton), and the femme fatale (Ferguson). But the film was never able to gain enough traction to take flight. The storyline had potential but substandard acting and meandering plot-line left me detached and indifferent. There were a couple of plot twists but not unpredictable.The movie had great potential with its setting of ocean flooded coastline and the technology of reminiscence as an escapism from an intolerable existence. But these futuristic concepts were not developed other then as simple underutilized background to forward an uninspired story line forward.to it's predicable and uninspired ending.I am a fan of Hugh Jackman and Thandiwe Newton. But the scene of their big argument was some of the worst acting I've seen from actors of their caliber... totally forced and unbelievable. The fight scenes were also unconvincing and the choreography was below modern movie's standards..A movie to watch when it streams or on DVD rental. But unless you are a strong Jackman fan not worth spending the money in the theater. Alternate movies might be Blade Runner (Harrison Ford) or Surogates (Bruce Willis) both of which are better movies in my opinion.And to those who rate Reminiscence high and pity me for not being capable of understanding the movie, I have seen thousands and thousands of movies in my lifetime. I like movies of all genres as long as they are well crafted films. I know the difference between a great move, good move, mediocre movie, and terrible movie.

I wanted to like this movie and after a while it just kept letting me down.Questions I asked myself last night after watching this:
1. Why are they in love? (There's zero substance to their relationship shown beyond lust).2. Why establish rules for reminiscence to just have Nick continually break them? Are they trying to show how much he cares for her? It just seems like a crazy stalker trying to find the woman that left (yes, he is validated, but still seems off).3. Why is there a random, overly long, fight scene just thrown in the movie for literally no reason?4. Why make this huge elaborate semi post-apocalyptic world, to have it all mean nothing? Was the whole point of a world underwater just to have Nick find the White House in the ocean? I mean, there was literally no other tie to this whole elaborate setup (wasted opportunity).Just a letdown. I wanted to love it but found myself realizing the movie peaked about 30 minutes in and then just slowly tapered into nothing. I did enjoy the music and the singing though.",Reminiscence

The problem stems from the fact that it defines memories in a form that does not exist.Our memories consist of what we have seen, heard, smelled, tasted and touched. Reminiscence relies, in part, on the notion that memories include things that we could not be aware of.Moreover, the film constructs memories based on how others might view our experience.For example, in one case a client seeks to recall where she lost a key through an examination of her memories. She unknowingly drops the key but we are expected to believe that she remembers having done so.Ms. Joy should stick to writing.",Reminiscence

Not original by any means, but that's not the intention: the opposite. Noir has it's tested format and tropes to which the movie conforms faithfully, and it still works. The lonely, jaded detective; the femme fatale; the brutish yet somewhat sympathetic antagonist; the cynical but honest friend: all very well cast, particularly Thandiwe Newton who I found very reminiscent of a Thelma Ritter in this. What this captures of the old movies that many comparable films don't is the sentimentality, and I think it eventually succeeds in it's central aim of generating a wistful atmosphere, though it's no ""Out of the Past"".I wanted to see what the director had done with a favourite genre, and I apreciated it - it was to my taste.",Reminiscence

601,tannerholloway,'Reminiscence': Money Can't Buy the Magic of Storytelling,6,21 August 2021,"For those of you who don't want to read a drawn-out review, or haven't seen the movie yet, I'll try to do a short, spoiler-free summary in this part. To be blunt, on the surface, 'Reminiscence' was entertaining. It has a decent story with fantastic visuals, but just doesn't capture that magic. I've seen pretty harsh criticisms of the movie in other reviews, most of which I don't think are warranted. I am personally under the impression that this movie was predisposed to be harshly criticized. This is mostly due to its basic resemblance to 'Inception' and the relation of the director to Christopher Nolan (this is coming from someone whose favorite movie is 'Inception'). With that said, this is no 'Inception,' nor is it a distant relative. 'Reminiscence' has its flaws, like and directionless second act, unnecessary sequences, and what feels like an underdeveloped story. This being the case, makes the misuse of such a cool concept hurt just a little bit more. 'Reminiscence' has its flaws and is by no means great cinema, but I enjoyed it for the most part. If you're a fan of sci-fi or thrillers, I think this would be worth watching for something new.SPOILERS ARE FAIR GAME FROM THIS POINT ON (more specific review):
For starters, I like the setup of this movie. I like the world-building they did. They put their own spin on ""dirty future"" by being a corrupted, post-war, flooded Miami. The shots of this are also pretty awesome, but I wish they hid the CGI a little better. My main complaint on this would be that the exposition is slightly long, which turns many people off.One of my other complaints that kinda ties into this is the way they tried to introduce the audience. They breezed by the fact that the world was flooded and far-future. Then they proceeded to try and explain themselves by talking about this war (that happened prior to the events of the movie) over and over. They mention the war at least 5 or 6 separate different times, which got old very quickly. They tried to force too many themes into the corrupted world/war events.The thing they did very well with this movie is the visuals. The color filters, cinematography, and the look of the world were all particularly great. At the same time, this makes it feel slightly hollow since the visuals far outclass the story behind it. This shows me that they had a budget behind them and room to work with, but just didn't necessarily nail what they were going for.My main issue with this movie is the second act. The second act, or a large portion of the movie's middle, did not have any direction. This is where my ""underdeveloped story"" comment comes into play. I don't think the script was written well enough to warrant a nearly two-hour movie. The middle of the movie starts out on a bad note because it really hits a lull after we are introduced to the conflict. Then, it proceeds to show a bunch of unnecessarily long sequences that only move the plot along slightly. If you have ever heard the expression ""talking a lot without saying much,"" that's kinda the middle of this movie. This movie has quite a strong start and decent ending but did not know how to connect the dots through the middle.",Reminiscence

614,calabashmc,Strange Days knock off,5,24 August 2021,"While Reminiscence is not a bad movie it is a blatant rip off of Katherine Bigelows and James Cameron's 1995 classic, Strange Days. It has so many similar elements but with the soul sucked out of it despite the great acting and wonderful sets.After watching this I had to rewatch Strange Days, just to clean my palette. Despite its

617,ronnierukus,A Fresh New Take on Old Ideas,9,22 August 2021,"I'm willing to bet most of the people who disliked this film didn't understand it. Most of us are too impatient to let it play out. We want the flavors of a stew that's simmered all day at microwave speeds, but far too often life doesn't work that way. As Alton Brown says, ""Your patience will be rewarded.""This move has common themes and predictable undertones. But beneath the ideas and plot twists you think will play out is a masterpiece that bends time. Sometimes you don't know whether you're in the past or the present. This definitely has some Christopher Nolan time manipulation vibes. And I cannot stress how creative and emersive the world is in which this movie takes place. The technology feels like an episode Black MirrorFor most, this will take multiple views to digest all of the subtle clues and intricacies you missed the first time. I'd also recommend watching with the subtitles on. Don't be lazy. Don't get distracted. Put your phone down and pay attention to this movie. Your patience will be rewarded.",Reminiscence
618,velmoon,Are we talking about memories here?,5,26 August 2021,"First of all... the premise of this film: the possibility of going back to your memories and experience them as if you were there again... ok perfect!!! So why on earth would you remember your memories in third person ?? Did anybody noticed that the images of the memories are presented in third person? What the heck was that !? When I remember myself doing something I don't actually see myself, I remember what my eyes saw, or maybe is just me and everyone else have super powers ? It shocked me from the very beginning, and unluckily it goes on and on, so I couldn't stop thinking about this!! :(Secondly, The cast is great, but there's no chemistry between them. I was rather having fun by imagining Hugh's real life wife, watching the movie with him and saying... Hey baby, I think you can do a better effort in this kind of scenes, I'm not that jealous you know, I know is your work and we've been through this already.... Kiss, kiss good night.Thirdly, The ""key phrases"" of the movie, feel more like random phases coming from a brainstorming session at 10pm at night, everyone feeling super mega creative but super mega tired at the same time...

619,mmsucks,This year's biggest disappointment,1,2 September 2021,"Reminiscence was hyped up as a Christopher Nolan - esque movie. It's even directed by Christopher Nolan's sister in law, Lisa Joy. Form the cinematography, music, and storyline, the whole movie feels like a Christopher Nolan movie minus the quality.The biggest problem with this story is Lisa Joy's inability to write. She's not a creative as she used to be a corporate lawyer. Reminiscence's poor writing makes it clear that Lisa Joy's husband Jonathan Nolan is the REAL brains behind West World. Lisa Joy is just a coat tail rider. With West World, she rode her husband's coat tails and with Reminiscence she is riding Christopher Nolan's coat tails by trying to copy him. Instead of copying Christopher Nolan, she should have tried to do her own thing.As many other reviewers have pointed out, the only reason this wannabe Nolan film got made was because of nepotism.",Reminiscence
620,Arjan8000,Good movie!,7,4 September 2021,"Lisa Joy has made a very good movie that is captivating to watch. Similar to her style in Westworld while watching you're trying to figure out what is actually going on with the main character and where the plot will take you. Slowly the main plot is starting to reveal itself and then another twist or turn happens. It was very nice to watch, visuals where really awesome. I rated this a 7/10 because I had fun watching and thought it was pretty good.The story was pretty clever, but the delivery made me just shrug along with it. I think it had more potential then was delivered, maybe thats shy the average rating here is so low. Definitely would recommend seeing it if you're on the fence due to the low-ish average review rating!",Reminiscence

If you don't get it, don't watch it and maybe don't hammer the rating so bad. I liked it and thought it was overall pretty good. I probably wouldn't pay movie theater prices to see it but if I had taken my wife on date, I wouldn't be angry either.",Reminiscence
622,centurycyclist28,Lost,6,22 August 2021,There was no real story behind it until almost the very end. It had so much potential. There was really no way of knowing why Hugh Jackman played a character who seemed so incredibly lost. It kept looping. I felt at first that it was going to be similar to inception. It felt like it for 15-20 min and then drifted. I've been trying to figure out how to rate it and I simply don't know. It made me think. The Cinematography was solid. The overall acting was good. I would have liked to have seen a different approach instead of this search that had way too many loops. I'd still recommend checking it out so you can feel the intensity of it.,Reminiscence
623,vadimsound,Good enough but not great,7,3 September 2021,"Well it's not Blade Runner (1982) but you got a pretty interesting concept, nice worldbuilding and art design, Hugh Jackman and all the main actors are really good along with Daniel Wu (who's in it for a couple of scenes but is stil lvery memorable), intriguing soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi (Pacific Rim, Iron Man, Game of Thrones and Westworld).In a world populated with kiddie popcorn comic book films this movie feels like a breath of fresh air and also urges you to read up on the Greek myth about Orpheus and Eurydice and a film that makes you want to learn something is OK in my book.Overall it is definitely worth a watch.",Reminiscence
624,alipup09,"It's a sci-fi, it's a romance, it's... not quite what it set out to be",3,28 August 2021,"I have never seen a movie so actively work against itself as Reminiscence does. There is so much potential in the world and characters of this movie, but the pacing, dialogue, and insurmountable twists lead to an ending that just... fizzles.The acting is great. Hugh Jackman, Thandiwe Newton, and Rebecca Ferguson still manage to bring life to a story that seems to reset itself every 15 minutes or so. What they can't do is make me care about characters that lack real arcs or motivation despite continuously reminding us of a troubling and interesting backstory.Nick (Hugh Jackman) and Emily (Thandiwe Newton) are veterans from a frequently mentioned, unnamed war that run a private business that assists others in reliving their memories. Thanks to the terrifying effects of global warming, there's no hope for the future so people escape to their past.Despite being an excellent premise, the story is then convoluted with romance wrapped around a crime mystery wrapped around corruption. Because of this, you don't realize what details of the story are important until they come up again later- making what should be riveting twists feel jarring and completely out of place.Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) also has a chance to be an amazing character. As an ex-addict running from a troubled past, she manipulates Nick in order to save her own life but ends up falling in love with him in the meantime. Although her story isn't anything new, the only real fun in the story is sifting through the past that brought her into the enchanting romance she had with Nick. But the closer we get to the present, the more the story ruins her character.There's this guy, Saint Joe, who Nick is helping the police find, but he's not the antagonist. Dirty cop Cyrus Boothe who even skims off Saint Joe is... because he's hired by Sebastian Sylvan to find Mae, to find Nick, to find Elsa and, much more importantly, her son.Mae is helping Boothe because he's threatened to turn her back to Saint Joe after also stealing from him. This is where I became intrigued by her unnecessarily awesome skills of manipulation that she can't use again to save Elsa's son and herself. Her story fizzles to an ending where she must kill herself to save a character we barely know to prove she's a good person to Nick- which is just disappointing.But this world, drowning in an ever expanding ocean and burning during the day is beautiful. Whether it's water taxi or train, traveling across states to solve this mystery is beautiful.Did this review feel jarring and unsure where it was going? That's how you will feel watching this movie.",Reminiscence

It got really ugly and unbelievably cheesy. In general, everything was so bland and predictable I wanted to close my eyes :)Westworld (some episodes written by this director/writer) was good.

668,dimitrijemilosevic,What movie did you guys watch?!,9,28 August 2021,"I'm honestly mad that this movie will be (and already is) a box office failure, because of potential audiences getting discouraged by bad reviews from people acting like sheep, who just copy from others and can't create their own opinions.Acting is amazing, score by Ramin Djawadi is amazing, and i can't find any fault in Lisa Joy's direction. Story is great, and especially commendable is the way Script made it fit in all the right places at the right times. Themes and subject matter that this movie explores and the way it explores them is accomplished in really effective and realistic way.What is the biggest sin of this movie? - It relies on exposition a little bit more than usual to establish some parts of the story. That's mostly because there is no way director Lisa Joy could show us entire world-building of it in 2 hours runtime. I'm 100% sure those were the restrictions made by the studio, especially for the first time movie director. This is not lazy or forced exposition, it's just necessary and i think script handled it gracefully.Did people expect action movie? This is not action movie. You writing: ''I was so bored, I fell a sleep'', because you expected Inception 2, is not this movie's problem.There wasn't doubt in my mind that this movie deserves anything less than 8/10, but because i liked it as much as i did on a personal level i'll give it a 9/10. I have few nitpicks with it, some little things that didn't make much sense on the first viewing, but i only watched it on TV, and i plan to watch it again on a big screen when it comes to theater near me.",Reminiscence

The elusive pasts of characters interlock mystically with their present lives in this provocative film. Acutely-choreographed fight scenes make clever use of the environment and portray the intense stakes of this harrowed world. The mostly engaging dialogue does lapse at times, once in a while putting a strange distance between supposedly close characters. Yet, the performance of the cast pulls the weak scenes together with the strong ones.

This movie has lots of Inception vibes and impressions but with it's own unique and different style that clearly differentiates it. The plot is refreshing and kind of new, pacing is well formed, cinematography is excellent and acting is phenomenal especially that of Hugh Jackman. Reminiscence is significantly driven by nostalgia, the main context is manifested by emotions, sentiment, and eagerness towards the past as well as memories.

I surprised that I actually made it through a quarter of the movie. This movie moved slower than me getting up to go get a snack from the pantry. I checked the time when I thought I was at the halfway point and preceded to say ""It's only been a half hour? I've invested way to much into this movie."" I preceded to walk out of the room and write this review as my memory of this movie is fresh.The characters of this movie live on the coast... where the water levels have risen to where they can barely survive. I'm no expert on geography, but isn't there a state in the middle of the country where there are no oceans called Kansas? Nobody lives there because there is no reason for it to exist. There would be plenty of room there. The one reason this movie gives me hope is because, according to their logic, California will be underwater in the near future and I think that is for the better.I can't comprehend the time setting of this movie either. Its like walking into a futuristic home, but you realize that there is still plastic on the furniture because an old lady lives there.Advice I give to people that want to see this movie: Use that weird bathtub to go back to a time where you haven't heard of this movie and use your hour and fifty five minutes to to anything besides watch this movie.",Reminiscence

700,sdpersonal,A cool sci fi nod to film noir mysteries,8,22 August 2021,"Negative reviewers are missing the point here. Ripping on this movie for using voiceover means they don't understand that it was purposely referential - what's wrong with a twisty, turny mystery, pulling imagery and pomp from classier times, but wrapped up in a sci if plot device? It's a particular flavor, to be sure. But not a bad one. And certainly not a poorly executed one.Reminiscence is a lot of puzzle pieces that are hard to understand at first, but presented in a romanticized and aesthetically pleasing way (think ""The Tourist"" or the 50's vibes evoked by shades of ""Inception""). Maybe I'm just a sucker for all the buttons this movie pressed, but I really enjoyed it - enough sci fi to make the plot feel interesting, but not so much that it lost substance.",Reminiscence
701,nicoladguess,Very dumbfounded by how bad this was,2,22 August 2021,"Oh wow, this was poor.The makers of this movie are banking on you not having seen Strange Days, which the main plot was taken from. They then amateurishly mixed in elements from other movies, hoping this film-by-numbers approach could produce something passable.To be honest, had they just stuck with copying 100% of their ideas, they might have produced an unoriginal but good pastiche of other better films.But no. They added in their own dialogue which is the worst I have heard, at least this decade. They also made sure 45 minutes of the film is exposition, because an audience just loves to be explained to. They then decided the love story on which the rest of the film hinges can be told in montage form and slotted this into a ten minute segment at the start of the film. Then, to tick the ""this film is profound"" box, they have characters referring to Greek mythology over and over again, and coming out with the kind of trite aphorisms instagrammers go loony for.It's basically a boring, pretentious two-hours of Hugh Jackman growling, unnecessary action sequences, and superfluous side-plots.

Quite a few reviewers compare it unfavorably to ""Inception,"" and I have to admit that I've neve seen the latter, but ""Reminiscence"" hit me like a hammer. I didn't know what the movie was about when I went in, and only understood its associations with memory as the plot unfolded. I lost five close relatives in an eight month period, and I would gladly give ten years of my life for one more Christmas with them all; the beginning scene where the man wants only to go back and throw the ball for his dog hit me hard. And great lines--""Memory is like perfume, best in small doses."" ""If there are ghosts to be found, it's us who haunt the past. We haunt it, so we can look again. See the people we miss, and the things we missed about them.""I thought the photography was beautiful, the writing and acting were great, and the characterizations complex. Thandiwe Newton going Rambo at one point was a bit of a surprise, but I liked it. In short, this movie has at least one huge fan. Yes, it was entertaining, but it also touched me deeply, and that's what great art is supposed to do. I will definitely watch it again.",Reminiscence

I love how much of a word-smith Lisa Joy is with this film, adding intricate details into the plot and demonstrating a clever knowledge and usage of time, not too far into the film, much like the introduction of Inception.The cinematography has got Hoyte Van Hoytema written all over it. However, referring to my previous comparison of Deja Vu, it's a big improvement, adding natural light (although CG/studio work in parts) into the film, it's simply stunning to look at!The soundtrack is just awesome. After further inspection of the cast and crew, I can see why Nolan and Joy had Ramin Djawadi in the team, working on the Westworld soundtrack, they clearly have a great working chemistry within the Westworld/Reminiscence team!

This film was around about a 6. Showed promise with the concept but ultimately failed on too many fronts. My problems with it are:1/ Opening scene - just looked like bad CGI - uh oh I thought within the first few seconds - not a good start2/ The whole flooded city concept - just doesnt work - you cant just carrry on a couple of floors up. Venice works but most other cities dont like water.3/ The water is crystal clear - no sewage, mud or debris from the flooded city, let alone the lack of sealife.4/ The dialog in places is so cliché - some of Thandiwe Newton's lines were painful.5/ The technology doesnt make sense - how can someone have memories where they are looking at themselves - their memory is what they see, not a scene that they are visibly in. When was the last time you had a dream where you were visible?6/ The voice over narration clearly is following the film noir of the ""Double Indemnity"" et al, but just comes across as cheesy and a replacement for bad visual story telling. You can't marry film noir narration and science fiction, as the cinematic release of Bladerunner proved.7/ At the end he is lying in the tank with a tidy greying goatee - and Thandiwe Newton is a greying grandmother. So clearly in the preceding 30 years or so he has been lying in that water being cared for with someone feeding him, clearing up his excretions and shaviing him (no scummy water or hairs) - not to mention the fact that they have to keep the electricity on to keep him dreaming - who's paying for that?Lisa Joy clearly married the wrong Nolan.

Hugh Jackman carries the film well. The production and set design are very interesting as a world set in a climate change affected future.It's not a perfect film nor is it for everyone. But it's far better than the 4's and 5's it's gotten to this point.",Reminiscence
732,KmanS,This demonstrates how making a movie and a TV series are significantly different endeavors.,4,20 August 2021,"I had great expectations of this because of Westworld. Halfway through it, I realized the concept (of being able to relive memories) found itself into a sub-optimal channel -- a movie. At the end, I was sure I didn't want to relive my experience of watching this.The movie opens with great ambition. The camerawork and direction are clearly inspired by movies like Inception and the world-building is pretty good. The special effects that demonstrate a Miami in a future where sea levels have risen are very well done but the icing couldn't save the cake -- the cake being the core items the movie should have been exploring.Westworld succeeded because the series took a concept and explored multi-faceted layers from a philosophical perspective. This movie could have done that too but fails because the time needed, which otherwise would have been present in a TV series, has shrunk to a few minutes. The whole story, of course, needed to be told in under 2 hours!With very little time spent, much of the chemistry between characters is left unexplored and seems rushed. You neither feel for Elsa nor Freddie, leave alone some of the other characters. I would not be surprised if this concept is reused in the future as a TV series. A whole new world opens up to explore and create, with no rush, with a concept where one is able to relive their memories!",Reminiscence

What motivated Nick Bannister to pursue his ""Eurydice"" into the dark underworld of crime? What made him wake up from his listless existence as observer to become an active participant in the hunt for the truth? Was Mae a siren or just a lost soul? Was it just lust that drew them together or did they find a place where life had a meaning for them? Each of the other souls had a secret that drove them - the assistant, the underworld kingpin, the henchman/policeman. The tycoon & the wife& the mistress... each of their stories (and many others) collaborated towards this unusual story of intrigue in a dark near-future world.

They're bad but you know they're bad and you continue to watch them to fill time because they're enjoyable in places.This is not one of those movies. The trailer sells it as this brilliant sci-fi thriller set in underwater Miami. Except the underwater element was absolutely... pointless. Nothing happens underwater. There's zero relevance to it. You could explore people's memories without it being 'a time before we were underwater'. They make one fleeting reference to it being 'too hot in the daytime, so we became nocturnal' but again, no actual reasoning behind any of the vague climate change disaster movie you could have expected.At every point where you think 'oh, this could get interesting now', it takes an unnecessary, pointless turn for no good reason apart from making you sigh in your cinema seat for another half an hour, wishing you'd brought an extra pre-mixed gin and tonic into the cinema to cope with the everlasting pointless plot.Don't see it, not even on a rainy Saturday afternoon at home.",Reminiscence

The direction is fine, bar the fight sequences which are poor. But still a great setting is wasted, so much potential but under utilised.I actually really enjoyed the final third but Hugh Jackman's voice over is up (down?) there with Harrison Ford's Blade Runner one!Don't avoid as there is much to like, just don't expect to be blown away.",Reminiscence

Don't compare it to inception, just don't. I don't think it was ever supposed to be anything close to Inception.This movie has the vibe of the 90s movies, it promises to be that and delivers accordingly.The cast wast simply outstanding.From cinematography point of view it will melt your heart if you love this kind of things, a bit moody, a bit nostalgic.I'd be happy to see more movies like this one.The only thing that could have been better was the story, but still, this movie is better than 90% of anything in the past 2 years.",Reminiscence

The idea for the movie is ok and the actors good but the execution is absolute B-grade. Don't expect anything really from the plot, it's just a basic action movie probably made to exhaust the hunger of action movie fans.Second positive thing about the movie is the unpredictability of the ending, even though throughout the movie you already know what is going to happen in every scene.The characters try to be witty and clever in every sentence they say which makes the movie even harder to watch and sometimes cringeworthy. Only thing from keeping me walking out of the movie was that I was watching it with 2 of my friends and didn't know did they like the film or not (plot twist, they didn't).Please just skip this movie if possible, absolutely nothing worth to see in this one.",Reminiscence

Why is Bannister explaining the story to the audience throughout the movie? Is the whole movie his reflection while he's permanently ""tanked""?2) What's with all the cheesy speeches by every freaking character? It's really over the top. Was the writer coerced into it?3) Don't repeat what we can see. We can see Mae saving the child. Bannister doesn't need to say it as he's watching the hologram. Just one of many such lines4) Get the details right please. Here is one big example: if Mae is a grandma shouldn't Bannister's body be severely older and atrophied? Did he set up an unlimited supply of nutrition via IV? Did he ask Mae to come periodically to inject him, shave him and replace the urine filled water? He could've been easily discovered dead after a few days. It would've been more real. Are we so attached to this character that he needs to stay alive? When the ending shows this kind if improbability, it becomes a farce and inconsistent with the rest of the movie which is an indication to me they didn't think it through and lowers my overall opinion significantly.",Reminiscence

I had no preconceived notions, but my expectations were high after seeing the trailer.After the movie was over, it took me some time to really understand how I felt about the movie. In that sense, I immediately give it credit as thought provoking. I did not see it as boring or feel like it was dragging and especially did not run the risk of falling asleep as others mentioned.I believe you need to let the story pull you in. There are multiple layers to this story, so give it time. I don't care about the seas rising or why they chose to stay in Miami or even about the war. I chose to focus my attention on the elements that were important and I found those elements to be intriguing and they kept me interested the entire length of the film.This movie is not for everyone and that's okay...just give it a chance and you may enjoy it.

It is deep and often poetic. The acting is well-played and the plot is superb. There are more than enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes. There is mystery, action, love and romance.This is an intelligent movie. You have to focus, think and feel. Every word spoken, every action taken has a purpose. If you approach this movie in a slipshod manner, you won't get it.For me personally, there is something haunting (in a good way) about this movie.

The concept and world setting was interesting. The actors did such a good job, I really was amazed by the performances.It was quite puzzling though. Filling in the blank pieces as we go into the movie and remembering all the faces but overall the story became clear. I was glad it wasn't about a world-saving effort but just a man that tells us how the world is now and why people come to him for the past.I love how this movie was taking it calmly, it has action moments and no unnecessary gory things, exactly what I was hoping for this movie. It also had some very cool shots and moments of cinematography. Its actually a mix of sci-fi and romance and when you understand the details the characters tell people or the viewer, you feel the history and context of this world which was done quite well.I must say I didn't understand everything after the first watch but I definitely will watch this again and I recommend this movie for all the sci-fi genre lovers, just don't expect the stereotypical utopian happy world with lots of dramatic actions but just a relaxing deep story that does take quite the turns to keep you interested.",Reminiscence

Do this and you will understand at least a part of this movie. Then think about when they walked back out of it again, and you may begin to feel the rest of it.People poo-pooing this movie, well, they make me wonder if they've never felt deeply about anything. Maybe it is because this movie caught me at a time when i have been particularly reminiscent, but it really struck a chord, and not one that any other movie I've ever seen has hit in quite the same way.Take that cynicism and push it to the side and go see this movie. Don't throw it out though, keep it nestled in the back of your mind. You'll need it to fully appreciate this one.Oh, and as an aside, i've seen some reviewers saying things like the performances were bad or there was no chemistry or even that the writing was bad and then i've seen others praising all 3. I'm not sure where the naysayers are coming from on these points. I found the writing to be at least decent through and in spots brilliant. The chemistry between Thandiwe Newton and Hugh Jackman was rough, but this was done with purpose which you'll come to understand during the movie.
