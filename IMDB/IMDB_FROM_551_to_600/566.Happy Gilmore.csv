0,MartinHafer,Formulaic and dumb....but worth seeing for one scene.,6,1 March 2009,"HAPPY GILMORE is a very shallow and formulaic film. Despite some odd twists (such as a hockey player somehow making a great golfer), the overall plot structure is very, very familiar. In many ways, this film is like CADDYSHACK combined with the typical ""poor guy makes it big"" film--with few major surprises. So, when Gilmore ends up having his big golf game at the end of the film, don't look for anything particularly novel or surprising.So far, it sure sounds like I am not big on this film and that would certainly be correct. However, part-way through the film, there is one of the singularly funniest scenes I can recall seeing in a film in recent memory. DO NOT READ ON UNLESS YOU DON'T MIND MY SPOILING THIS FOR YOU!!! DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!! During a celebrity golf tournament where celebrities are teamed with pro golfers, Happy is paired with Bob Barker. Repeatedly, Happy makes a nuisance of himself. It becomes so bad that the usually nice persona of Barker disappears and they have a UFC-style fight that is very funny. After all, seeing a very elderly Barker in a fight is funny--at least in a silly and unsophisticated way. And sometimes I could use this sort of laugh.So, while the film is far from great, there is enough to see and enjoy that I mildly recommend it. Plus, for parents it's one of the few films that kids like that you can watch without feeling your brain cells rotting away--like it would if you were forced to watch LITTLE NICKY!",Happy Gilmore
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Nothing groundbreaking or anything, but it is amusing and it is for me one of Sandler's better movies",7,1 June 2010,"I cannot say I am a fan of Adam Sandler, while I do find him irritating in general, he has done some decent movies. Happy Gilmore is one of his better movies, though I would personally put The Wedding Singer and Spanglish over this. But it is better than Little Nicky and the Mr Deeds remake, that I can tell you. The story is predictable and holds no surprises, the script is somewhat uneven and the ending struck a false note with me. However, while it is of no cinematic value, the cinematography and scenery are above decent, and the slapstick action and sports sequences do have its amusing moments and when I say amusing it was actually amusing. Adam Sandler is delightfully goofy and a lot less irritating than I usually find him and Julie Bowen is a nice romantic interest. Overall, not exceptional being a bit of a no-brainer, but it is an amusing knockabout sports comedy. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Happy Gilmore
2,SnoopyStyle,Adam Sandler is angry funny,7,12 April 2015,Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is desperate to be a professional hockey player but he's horrible at skating and can't handle the puck. He does however have great intensity and the hardest shot. His grandma (Frances Bay) hasn't paid her taxes and they're confiscating her stuff including her house. He discovers that he can really hit the golf balls and starts hustling golf. Golf pro Chubbs (Carl Weathers) takes him under his wing to join the PGA tour. Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) is the arrogant star golfer. Virginia Venit (Julie Bowen) is public relations for the tour.Adam Sandler is still funny at this point. There is something endearing about a young idiot who still has lots to learn. The compelling part is that his character grows. He's an angry dude and a hilarious one. His character is one that the audience can root for while at the same time laugh at. Sure it's stupid but that's the fun part.,Happy Gilmore
3,gavin6942,Fast-Paced and Relaxing Sandler Film,7,24 September 2006,"If you don't like Adam Sandler, you won't like this film. But that should be obvious. This one is not as laugh-out-loud funny as ""Billy Madison"" nor as subtle in its witty humor as ""Wedding Singer"", but is one of the easiest to watch for just winding down after a long day.Happy Gilmore is a hockey player who has no future in hockey. So he becomes a golfer instead (not unlike the guy from ""The Cutting Edge"" who became a figure skater). Luckily, he's a very good golfer because he needs the money to save his grandmother's house from being repossessed so she can escape from Ben Stiller's sadistic nursing home.Again, you won't get any over-the-top laughs like the singing clown from ""Billy Madison"" and no obscure references like ""Wedding Singer"", but lots of little jokes to keep you going. Most memorable is the fight between Adam Sandler and Bob Barker, which is probably not only one of the film's best moments, but no doubt created a resurgence in ""Price is Right"" fans among the college age demographic.And then there's the appearance of a ghost of Abraham Lincoln, which is either completely nonsensical or some very subtle racial joke. Oh, and then there's the midget on the tricycle. Does it make sense? No, but it does not have to.In my opinion, the film is not worth owning (I'd rather own ""The Wedng Singer"") but is still one of those you can watch again and again because of its light and fluffy nature (sort of like Jell-O). And who doesn't want to help save their grandmother?",Happy Gilmore
4,lee_eisenberg,"Happy 40th, Adam!",10,9 September 2006,"Since today is Adam Sandler's 40th birthday, I decided to comment on one of his movies. ""Happy Gilmore"" is one of two movies in which he seeks to make something of himself in sports (the other is ""The Waterboy""). This flick basically has him doing his usual stuff, and anyone who gets in his way gets pounded, all tied around his desire to do something for his grandmother (Frances Bay).Still, I can imagine how much fun they must have had filming some of those scenes. If absolutely nothing else, the ""Frankenstein's foot"" scene should make the whole movie worthwhile (although the Bob Barker scene is pretty neat also). It just goes to show that sports don't have to be all about machismo; they can just be silly. Also starring Christopher McDonald, Julie Bowen, Carl Weathers, Allen Covert (who most recently appeared in the Sandler-produced ""Grandma's Boy""), Robert Smigel, Richard Kiel, Kevin Nealon and Ben Stiller.One more thing: why'd they film an Oregon scene in Washington?!",Happy Gilmore
5,jboothmillard,Happy Gilmore,4,27 May 2011,"I had heard about this film, because of the leading actor and the theme of the film, I certainly wanted to see it, from director Dennis Dugan (Big Daddy, You Don't Mess with the Zohan, Grown Ups). Basically failed hockey player Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is looked after and living with his grandmother, he has no direction in life and his grandma owes money from taxes to keep the house. One day while at a driving range he is bet on that he can't hit a golf ball far, and that is when he discovers his talent to hit a ball a hundred feet away. Retired pro golfer Chubbs (Predator's Carl Weathers) spots Happy and this newfound talent, and he tells him that a lot of money can be made going pro, at first he is reluctant but he enters the debut championship. He manages to win and is ready to go to the real championships to play professional golf, alongside such high profile players like the egotistical Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Happy slowly becomes a talking point, not just for his skill to hit a ball far to the hole, but for his temper tantrums and frequent swearing when he goes wrong on the course. He is of course earning loads of cash and the fund needed to pay for the house is slowly being raised, but there is the obvious low point when he is forced to stop playing. Chubbs gives him back some confidence on a mini golf course, and even though his one-handed friend dies, Happy is determined to beat Shooter, they bet with each other to win the championship for ownership. So the big championship match comes round, Happy trails for a little while, letting Shooter gloat and be a bastard, but in the end the hero prevails, and Happy and his grandma get their house back with the prize money. Also starring Julie Bowen as Virginia Venit, Frances Bay as Grandma, Allen Covert as Otto, Robert Smigel as IRS Agent, Bob Barker, The Spy Who Loved Me's Richard Kiel as Mr. Larson, Dennis Dugan as Doug Thompson, Joe Flaherty as Jeering Fan and Lee Trevino. Sandler as always is the fun often moody slightly odd hero, McDonald and Weather also do well in the two main supporting roles, there are some good typical slapstick jokes, and you can enjoy the golfing moments, it's not such a bad sports comedy. Okay!",Happy Gilmore
6,ccthemovieman-1,To Be Remembered Forever: 'Happy' And Bob Barker Trading Blows,9,30 March 2006,"A ""pro"" golfer duking it out with veteran game-show host Bob Barker right in the middle of a tournament. That scene alone makes this one of the more memorable comedies of the last 30 years. Almost everyone I know has either seen or heard of that scene and everyone laughs at it.It IS ludicrous and that's what makes it so funny. In fact, most of the movie is totally preposterous, totally unbelievable and totally wacky, which is Adam Sandler's trademark in these comedies. He's low key but violent, as he was in Mr. Deeds, Punch-Drunk Love and a few other films.Here, Sander is even more vocal and violent than normal and definitely more crude, which is saying something since this actor usually doesn't play guys with a lot of class. ""Happy"" is a hot-tempered hockey player who can hit a golf ball 400 yards so he tries his hand on the PGA tour to help raise money for his grandmother. I just shake my head even writing that last sentence, it sounds so stupid....but this is a stupid movie with an incredibly stupid story but is hilarious, for the most part.Anyone who is a golfer would appreciate this movie more than others, because Sandler says and does things we'd all like to do on the links at times but, thankfully, don't. In short: this is a crude but very funny movie.",Happy Gilmore
7,Quinoa1984,Apollo Creed with a wooden hand!! funny as hell,7,30 April 2000,"Adam Sandler has a very funny movie here that works like no other since Caddyshack.  Sandler plays a lazy guy who has to save his grandmother's house from being removed.  So, he starts to play golf in a way that only Sandler can.  He is also instructed by Carl Weathers (who memorably played Apollo Creed in Rokcy), and wathcing his scenes I had to leave the theater from laughing so much (he had a wooden hand and it always gets knocked off). Sandler knows how to keep people rolling in the ailes, and this proves it. A++",Happy Gilmore
8,bevo-13678,Classic sander brilliance,10,29 March 2020,I like the bit where he hits the golf ball really hard. Comic genius. If Adam Sandler doesn't go down as the greatest actor of all time then it will be a travesty,Happy Gilmore
9,hitchcockthelegend,Mr. Angry channels aggression nicely...,7,7 August 2016,"True Story. All my friends are golfers, however, it's not a sport for me. I played with them once after they continued to badger me about it, at a par 4 hole I used a putter instead of a driver to get onto the green, literally just whacked it straight and hard, I holed in 3, much to my friend's consternation!!The purpose of that story is why I enjoyed Happy Gilmore so much, it takes fun pot shots at the sport whilst daftly proclaiming that any dude can play in his own style. This is an absolutely no brain movie of course, with a plot as daft as it sounds - a failed/angry ice-hockey player takes up golf to earn money to save his granny's house from being repossessed - and of course he becomes a cause célèbre to the golfing curates.Sandler has and always will be an acquired comedy taste, making this very much one for his fans only. And truth be told this is basic Sandler where he's shouty and sweary, and he certainly improved on a filmic level from this point on. So what you gonna do? I laughed a lot, but you see I'm a Sandler fan (though there are some films of his I positively hate), it cheered me up and sometimes that's all I want from one of his movies. 7/10",Happy Gilmore
10,Theo Robertson,It Didn`t Make Me Unhappy,3,14 October 2003,"I`ve never understood the popularity of Adam Sandler or the fact that he`s presently one of the highest paid stars in Hollywood at the moment . I`ve not seen too many Sandler movies so perhaps I should hold back my opinion but I think HAPPY GILMORE is an archetypal Sandler movie . Sandler plays Gilmore a self deluded ice hockey player who`s a bit goofy and a bit of a schmuck who tries his hand at golf and ... well you`ll have to see the movie to find out what happens I expected to hate this movie since I`ve little interest in either Sandler or golf , but it`s not nearly as bad as I expected . It`s hardly a classic comedy like CADDYSHACK was but it is amusing in parts and one scene involving Gilmore`s rival and "" Frankenstien`s foot "" made me chuckle .",Happy Gilmore
11,jotix100,Five under par,6,5 January 2005,"A hockey player, turned into a golf ace, is the premise for the movie. Dennis Dugan has delivered a funny comedy, even though it doesn't break any ground on this genre.Adam Sandler is somehow controlled in the film. He delivers as Happy Gilmore, a man that takes up golf as a way to make enough money to save the family home. The grandmother will lose the house because of the expenses of paying for the nursing home, where has gone. The nursing home is ruled by the maniac Ben Stiller, who terrorizes the lady. It's strictly a formula movie that can be played by the numbers. Watching it without any expectations proved to be better than resisting the inanity of the screen play.The funniest moments are the scenes of Mr. Sandler with Carl Weathers, the man with a wooden hand. The two actors are immensely funny. Without a doubt, the best thing in the picture is the sequence involving Bob Barker playing Gilmore's partner. Mr. Barker is hilarious as the man that realizes how bad Gilmore is and wants to teach him a lesson for ruining his chance in the tournament.The film is mildly funny. If nothing else is playing, it's worth a look.",Happy Gilmore
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,I'll admit that I'm not in the target audience,6,31 October 2009,"I get it, I really do. He grew up as a Jew in Conservative, Christian America. He's not the only one who got screwed up by it. Look at Seinfeld, Mel Brooks, or, if you want to see a case where the individual got *really* warped, take a gander at 'Weird Al' Yankovic. I understand, but I still can't get into Sandler's aggressive style of humor, where it seems like those least deserving of pain and whatnot are first in line to receive it in copious amounts. Not big on sports flicks either, and the ""underdog defeats the pro"" crap is the worst kind of them, hands down. Apart from that, Dennis Dugan, who helmed the two most hateful movies I have ever seen, Saving Silverman and National Security(sexist and racist, respectively, both in the extremes), is undoubtedly my least favorite director. Why did I watch this? It was on TV, and I knew I'd have stuff to say, as I took it in years ago, when my tastes were less refined, and even *then* I couldn't stand this. If you've read this far in my review, you basically know what kind of... piece, and I'm not saying of what, this is. The Stiller thing needed a pay-off, am I right? On the plus side, it's nice to see Richard Kiel work again(Jaws from two Bond films), and his T-shirt rocks. If you're into this kind of comedy, you'll probably enjoy yourself. The acting is good. It's shot and edited well. There is moderate to strong language in this, as well as disturbing content and mild sexual content. I recommend this to fans of those who made it. 6/10",Happy Gilmore
13,view_and_review,The Price is Wrong Bob!,8,16 July 2020,Ooooh the early days of Adam Sandler. He was gold back then and Happy Gilmore was perhaps his magnum opus.,Happy Gilmore
14,anaconda-40658,Happy With Sandler.,6,12 May 2015,"Happy Gilmore (1996): Dir: Dennis Dugan / Cast: Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen, Carl Weathers, Christopher McDonald, Bob Barker: Not nearly as funny as Caddyshack, which worked due to its views of golf stereotypes. A name like Happy Gilmore indicates that he was the apple of his grandmother's eye but it never sustained his inner torment. He plays bad hockey but when his grandmother is forced into a nursing home by the I.R.S he promises to win her home back but he does so through golf. Carl Weathers coaches him then he feuds with champion Shooter McGaven. The idea of one's talent translating to unfamiliar places works as a plot but much of this is repetitious, predictable and stupid. Directed by Dennis Dugan who brought the world Problem Child. There are moments of visual flare but much of the humour is obnoxious. Nonetheless some viewers may relate to Adam Sandler as Gilmore whose willingness to help his grandmother is met with the struggle to maintain one's temper. Julie Bowen is basically a romantic prop to be won over. Christopher McDonald as Shooter is the high class antagonist. Weathers holds strong as a coach with a wooden hand due too an attack by an alligator. Bob Barker appears long enough to have a golf confrontation with Happy and beat the snot out of him. This is certainly no Caddyshack but it would be a great candidate for several cracks with a golf club. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Happy Gilmore
15,FlashCallahan,A warm glass of shut the hell up......,7,23 August 2014,"Happy's grandmother's house is foreclosed because of her failure to pay her taxes, and she's placed in a retirement home. He must try and find a way to make some money. Whilst at a driving range, he discovers that he can hit a golf ball a hundred feet, so the range pro, convinces him to try being a pro golfer. Reluctant at first, because he considers himself a hockey player, but when he learns he can make a lot of money, he gives it a try and surprisingly, in addition to his amazing driving ability, his personality has made him popular the crowd. Shooter McGavin, the tournament leader, thinks that Happy's an embarrassment and is jealous that he is stealing his spotlight, so tries to get him thrown out.....This is the film that did it for Sandler. The Wedding Singer is a brilliant movie, but this is the one that got Hollywood to notice the man. Here is the film that started it all, and Sandler knows this, that's why his production company is partially named after his career defining movie.But the main difference with his this, and films up to Big Daddy, and his later works, is that in this film, there are not as many random out of the blue moments like there are in Grown Ups, and Zohan, and this makes the film a little more coherent.That's not to say I don't like his later movies, I think the man is a funny writer, it's just that this stands the test of time, and can be watched over and over,without becoming too monotonous.It's consistently funny, Sandler is endearing enough to carry the whole movie, and Macdonald is excellent as the paranoid shooter.But we still have the random things here. Ben Stiller is wonderful as the orderly, and of course Weathers, who sends himself up something rotten.Its a fun film, always guaranteed to raise a smile.",Happy Gilmore
16,movieman_kev,travel back to a time when Adam Sandler was something that seems unimaginable nowadays...funny,9,5 September 2005,"Adam Sandler is Happy Gilmore, a constantly rejecter hockey player wannabe. Due to way overly late unpaid taxes, his mom will lose the house that Happy grew up in. Gilmore has no clue how to raise the money, so he puts his grand mom in a nursing home overseen by a cruel orderly (an uncredited Ben Stiller). Later, back at his grandmothers house, he tries to get the movers to get back to work by out distancing them in golf strokes. When he finds out that he has an amazing golf swing and can get money for it he heads to the putting range to have people pay to watch him. This is where he first catches the eye of Chubbs Peterson (a hilarious Carl Weathers), who wants to enter Happy in some pro tournaments. Happy is hesitant at first, but his need for money wins over. However he has quite a temper, which leads to the pro golfer Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) to loathe him. But Gilmore has Julie Bowen as a love interest who tries to keep him cool. This is a hilarious Sandler vehicle from way back when he was still funny. It has a great many lines that you'll find yourself quoting with friends months afterwords, non-stop hilarity, and a very memorable fight with Bob Barker. What more can one ask for? My Grade: A Special Edition DVD Extras: 6 Deleted Scenes; 5 minutes of outtakes; Combo trailer for the ""Dazed and Confused"" & ""Fast times at Ridgemont High"" DVDs; and Trailers for ""Chronicals of Riddick"", and ""the Bourne Supremacy",Happy Gilmore
17,Mr-Fusion,"Violence, hockey, vulgarity ... all the good stuff!",8,25 February 2019,"My favorite Adam Sandler movie.I just think it aligns perfectly with his comic persona. He seems to fit this character perfectly. It's the kind of adolescent silliness that I gravitate toward. I can't tell you how happy I was that my 9 year-old seemed to approve (""That was a very good movie""). And she's way more mature than her old man is.It's not just the character of Happy Gilmore that's memorable here, but also Shooter McGavin, and Christopher McDonald deserves credit for making the entitled jackass a solid villain. Same for Carl Weathers, and you would think he'd be slumming it here, but he sure doesn't show it.Best of all? Out-of-Nowhere Bob Barker; secure enough in his celebrity to openly parody it with a free-for-all fistfight.Tell me ""The Price is Wrong, b***h!"" isn't one of Sandler's best lines.",Happy Gilmore
18,SimonJack,Adam Sandler's zany move from the ice to the links,6,21 January 2021,"There was a time when Adam Sandler was trying to make each of his succeeding movies more far out and zany than any previous one. Well, ""Happy Gilmore"" did that in 1996. This is the type of film that many will find funny on the first viewing, but it doesn't hold up a second time. That's one of the problems with comedies that rely on antics, especially when they are crass, crude or mean-spirited. There's just enough of that in this film to keep it from being a very good comedy.The plot is good, and a version of one of the oldest standard themes of comedies, crime and action films. A hero comes to the aid of a relative or friend who's about to lose everything. Some of the sports scene are very funny, and good, Sandler's Happy Gilmore transition from a hockey slammer to the long-drive champ golfer is the core of this film. Most of the comedy around that is good.The fight on the green between Happy and Bob Barker is one of those scenes that's funny once-though a bit crude. The best of the supporting cast for some humor are Joe Flaherty as Donald, Gilmore's heckler in the crowd; Carl Weathers as Chubbs, and Allen Covert as Gilmore's homeless caddy, whom the credits list as Otto.",Happy Gilmore

20,StevePulaski,"The price is right, but the payment is short",5,26 November 2011,"Golf is dreadfully boring. Thankfully, films like Caddyshack and Happy Gilmore posses ambition to bring fun to the green. Both are fresh ideas that use their actors to motivate their screenplay. Unfortunately, Happy Gilmore manages to drive itself into the high grass area shortly when the game commences. Let's watch...Happy Gilmore is often cited as ""Sandler's funniest film."" I'm not sure he has one. I recently did a fairly lengthy blog post on the subject of Sandler's films and tried my hardest to find the one that made me laugh and enjoy thoroughly. I'd probably say his best piece of work had to be Funny People. Was it funny? Not a whole lot, but it was enjoyable and a step in the right direction Sandler quickly abandoned.The story of Happy Gilmore is simple; a loud, energetic, aspiring hockey player of the same name takes up golf when he finds out he has a powerful swing. He has serious anger management issues, and because of that, somehow, he attracts the gorgeous Julie Bowen, who plays a Public Relations Director, and also, a fellow golf player named Shooter McGavin (McDonald) who wants Gilmore off the face of the golf world.What Gilmore desperately wants to accomplish is getting $270,000 so he can buy back his grandmother's house that was recently taken away by the IRS because of failure to meet tax payments over the last decade.There's the setup, compiled of the obligatory sports movie and love story clichés, but the main problem is, well, Sandler's character. The Happy Gilmore character is odd, annoying, and aggravating. This is what you call a film's desperate attempt at comedy. Gilmore is easily fatigued, which is why his character is seriously hard to like or side with. The character gets into fights every few minutes, resulting in lame, cartoonish blows to the face and also to Sandler's personal ego.It seems the film couldn't succeed in the writing portion and went immediately to the punching, kicking, ""things didn't go my way"" kind of slapstick. Keep in mind that if you read many of my reviews you'll know I am a fan of silly slapstick. It takes a certain mood and a very likable lead actor to pull off good slapstick. I wonder if Chris Farley could've brought more coherent likability to the Happy Gilmore character.Also, the product placement is shamefully explicit. I'm aware it's golf, and like every other sport, is known to display product placement around the field, but when doing it in a film it appears that some of the big name companies are put in for the money - not the realism of the source material. Especially the utterly shameless marketing for Subway. Have mercy.When compared to present day Adam Sandler, Happy Gilmore has a harmless innocence to it. It's not harmful in any way, except maybe your tolerance level. Sandler finds will be at home with this, while others will search the screenplay high and low for the real humor.But, the film does deliver laughs, just not consistently. There's nothing more uncomfortable than watching a comedy, that is supposed to be funny, but isn't. Happy Gilmore gets laughs, but a lot of them aren't distinct in any way. I think the most memorable scene is when Bob Barker and Happy Gilmore square off on the green. I think one of Barker's lines before the scene should've been ""humor, come on down!"" Starring: Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen, Christopher McDonald, and Carl Weathers. Directed by: Dennis Dugan.",Happy Gilmore
21,Smells_Like_Cheese,One of Adam's funnier movies,7,12 September 2006,"I decided to get into the older Adam Sandler movies because I did hear a lot about them. I also heard about how funny Happy Gilmore was, my mom had mentioned how she had it, so I decided to give it a chance. To my surprise, I had an excellent time watching this movie. I have to say that this is actually one of my favorite Adam Sandler movies.My favorite part was Adam getting the crock as a gift for Carl Weathers as a Thank You present. But he screams, and well, I don't want to give the spoiler. You'll just have to see it. Happy Gilmore is a very funny movie with some terrific actors and I guarantee that you will at least get a few laughs.7/10",Happy Gilmore
22,DKosty123,Golf in a slap shot?,7,1 October 2007,"This film is very funny. The character development is extremely shallow, but you can't argue with the guest stars in this movie. The cast is loaded with lots of famous folks doing cameos.This turned out to be Richard Kiels last performance. He was always a busy character actor. Of course, legend Bob Barker does an amazing sequence.Adam stars as a hockey player who decides to try golf. The premise is just enough to hang the humor on. Once he starts, he turns out to be more of an oddity than any golfer around. Once you scrap reality, it works. How this sequence with Barker worked out is so amazing.People at Price is Right were asking Barker to repeat his line at the tapings even when he was getting ready to retire.This is a movie to put your brain in neutral & enjoy the humor.",Happy Gilmore
23,thesar-2,"Don't Look Now, I'm Finally Happy",7,27 July 2015,"A follow-up to his miserable Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore is actually one of Adam Sandler's best comedies he's done. Maybe they got the right script, the correct director or just that Sandler dropped his loud, incoherent, obnoxious and incomprehensible gibberisha ton worked here and I found myself actually (and FINALLY) laughing out loud in one of his comedies.I do my best to keep an open mind during any movie, and I devoted this weekend to spend more time with Sandler's more well-known films I hadn't seen. Even though, I didn't have high expectations for this. It didn't help, the opening credits were fairly lame and I thought: here we go again. But, then, the comedy began to work with Sandler's first couple of strokes of the golf balls. I started to uncontrollably laugh and enjoyed myself for the remainder of the flick.Granted, it's not the most original movie, and it relied on the usual antics, movie tricks and clichés. Still, I enjoyed the ride despite knowing how it would play out.Sandler works best when he doesn't lower himself to sudden, expected and whiney outbursts. Much like modern-day Melissa McCarthy; when she's not ""Tammy,"" she's pretty damn funny. If I hadn't just now watched this movie for the first time in 2015, I would've had a renewed faith in Sandler, despite his already failing grade in 1996. Unfortunately, he would continue to make an enormous amount of garbage that would certainly make his movies a(n unintentional) laughing stalk in the industry. That all said, he's had a few gems, and I completely recommend this one.",Happy Gilmore
24,Robert_duder,Sometimes I have to eat my words even when I don't want to,8,12 January 2016,"I had not seen Happy Gilmore. People were shocked when I would say this but I also had zero desire to see it and the more time that passed, the less I wanted to see it. It seemed like it was in that vein of comedy that I didn't care for at all. I don't hate Adam Sandler, but I hate when he does stupid so I lumped Happy Gilmore into that. My wife insisted we check it out when they added it to Netflix so we gave it a try. Not only was Happy Gilmore not terrible, it was actually quite funny and silly but in all the right ways and you can actually see Adam Sandler's charisma that has made him a comedy staple for the last couple of decades. This was far better than his fare as of late. I even was especially impressed with that infamous and ridiculous fight between Happy and Bob Barker. Someone told me just before I watched this that I had to because it was a staple of 90's cinema and I scoffed at them. Well I take back my scoff. For all it's ridiculousness, it is a quintessential 90's film and it's the perfect type of movie to just turn your brain off and have some fun.Sometimes its hard now to figure out why Adam Sandler is so successful. But when you go back and look at Happy Gilmore you see the type of guy that came out of Saturday Night Live with a ton of talent. Happy is a great character full of anger and uncontrollable outbursts and he's funny and commands attention. Its not an Award worthy performance, it's just a fun role. A good part of the success of the movie is the supporting cast. Christopher Mcdonald is absolutely perfect as the egotistical nemesis to Happy. McDonald is always good at these types of character roles and this is no exception. Julie Bowen (now known for Modern Family of course) is decent as the love interest. Her character is very one-dimensional but she does alright. She certainly doesn't flex any comedic muscles in the role. Frances Bay, another great character actor, is perfect as Happy's beloved Grandmother. Some other faces to watch for are Bob Barker (of course), Ben Stiller, Joe Flaherty, Richard Kiel and Allen Covert to name some of the stronger supporting roles.Director Dennis Dugan has had a very interesting career. He has done a lot of Television and a lot of silly comedy. Then he seems to have hitched his ride to Adam Sandler and hasn't looked back since. I don't know if Dugan feels comfortable in the genre or what but this was one of his better films with Sandler so I guess he deserves credit. I'm not sure he has much style, he just sort of uses his cast decently and tells his story. Happy Gilmore is a dirty adult comedy but it's also not toilet humour for no other sake so I can respect that. I laughed a lot and had a good time so I eat my words and I admit to Happy Gilmore's deserved legacy in 90's film history. 8/10",Happy Gilmore
25,g-bodyl,Hilarious!,9,1 November 2010,"Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison were the two movies that launched Adam Sandler's impressive career. They both were equally impressive movies but I am going to focus on Happy Gilmore of course. This movie is a great mixture of comedy and sport. Even though I despise golf greatly, I had a blast watching this film.This film is about Happy Gilmore, a guy with serious anger issues. he enlists in the Pro Golf Tour to win money so his grandmother can move back in her house that was taken away by the IRS.I though Adam Sandler was great here so screw that Razzie nomination. I think he is funny in every movie that he's supposed to be funny. I loved the cameos by Bob Barker and Ben Stiller. That made this movie even better.Overall, this movie is hilarious and one that I would watch over and over again. I rate this film 9/10.",Happy Gilmore

27,The-Sarkologist,Simply not what I ever expected from a golf movie,8,2 September 2012,"Just as a note, the day that I am writing this, January 20 1999, is the day is which Adam Sandler's new movie, the Waterboy, hits the screen. It is one that I have to see, just to find out what a ""Madoolaoblongorla (sp?) is. But this isn't a commentary on the Waterboy, that comes when I see the movie. No this is a commentary on Happy Gilmore, which I think is one of Adam Sandler's best movies, though I reckon most of them are pretty good.Happy Gilmore is about a guy named Happy Gilmore. He is an ice hockey fanatic and really wants the play. The problem is that he cannot skate, but he does have very good ball control. Still, they don't want him on the team. Things get worse when his grandmother is forced out of her house due to unpaid taxes, and while the removal guys are moving stuff out, they make a bet with Happy to hit a golf ball. It lands up that he can hit the golf ball over 400 meters and as such manages to get himself into the pro-tour. On this tour though is a man named Shooter McKay, who wants to win the yellow jacket. McKay is the bad guy: he is a conservative arrogant snob who has a way that golf should run, and the game does not include Happy Gilmore.What Happy Gilmore does though is that he adds new life to golf. His antics and his psychotic attacks attract a huge crowd and the ratings soar. The thing is that Happy has a big problem controlling his temper. When the ball doesn't do what it is supposed to do, he freaks out at it. When somebody gets in the way he will beat them up, and this draws a huge crowd. As such the golf board is very unwilling to let him go.Happy Gilmore is a hilarious movie. It is also a very popular movie. One of the video stores I go to claim that it is often out, while another said that their copy went to Movieland Heaven. It has some good quotes though the comedy more deals with Happy's actions. There is slapstick, which is actually pretty cool, but the comedy comes more out of the things Happy says and does. It is a great movie and I can see why it is so popular.Favourite quote: I eat pieces of sh*t like you for breakfast.What? You eat sh*t do you?",Happy Gilmore
28,briancham1994,Really funny,9,20 August 2020,This is one of Adam Sandler's best works. He has a totally zany and crude sense of humour that really pays off in this scenario. He totally invests in his role with an exaggerated gusto and this is what really makes the film hilarious.,Happy Gilmore
29,Floated2,Enjoyable Older Sandler film,8,9 August 2016,"Happy Gilmore is an early film of Adam Sandler's during his 1990's era. The spirit of the film and the title character played by Sandler are every bit as enjoyable as many have considered this film to be. Happy is the ultimate chip-on-his-shoulder leading man, who settles every argument with a punch in the nose or a biting wisecrack. He has a short fuse which is shown that the slightest spark can set him off, occasionally with great results. He is a lifelong hockey fan, and he wants desperately to play with the pros, but he has one problem which is he can't skate. However after one day occasionally fooling around with golf with a few friends, he is noticed by former gold legend Chubbs. From there on, Chubbs tells him that Happy is a great and has talent, though Happy doesn't want any part of golf since his goal is to become a hockey player. Happy Gilmore does have several decent laughs and Adam Sandler plays the character as needed. For a comedy the plot works well enough and the pacing is good. It isn't too long and it is quite enjoyable for those of fans of this sort of comedy. As a rewatch 02/27/20' Happy Gilmore remains an enjoyable and fun positive watch.",Happy Gilmore
30,johnnyboyz,An unhappy viewing experience which sees some rather disturbing material play out under a guise of adolescent comedy.,4,4 February 2010,"Happy Gilmore is one of the more distasteful sporting comedies you'll see, a film that tries to take sociopathic behaviour; marital problems; care-home abuse as well as rage and render each of them content that we may or may not find funny. The film's opening sets the tone in both the misjudged humour we'll be spending the next hour and half sitting through and the cold detachment from the piece we'll feel, when a mock home movie is established to be in the capable hands of an individual before they are killed at an ice hockey match. What happens next is the same 'home movie' aesthetic of the sequence, but this time with an 'invisible' shooter of the material. Such a ploy, after establishing a rather nostalgic tone to the piece before horribly killing of the camera operator, sets up the alienation the film has from the real world and will go along way in detaching us from the daft reality of its own – we feel disconnected from the off after I doubt there are many people in the world named Happy, but Happy Gilmore's Happy Gilmore is named-such, and he's played by Adam Sandler. I think Happy is, in fact, Happy; but the things that make him happy are things that do not necessarily make the rest of us so – it is the same relationship the film has with humour. Happy's life is built around conflict and pain. Throughout the duration of the film he'll be in direct competition with a rival sports star; he'll have a disagreement with some Ice Hockey coaches over whether he makes the team; he'll partake in stylised S&M sessions with one of those automated machines that pitch baseballs in full public view and a wrestling match with an alligator I suppose captures that insane rush for conflict and adrenaline that he so badly craves.But Happy's chief, overall source for conflict is with the state itself, when it is realised his Grandmother's scenario is that she must leave her house of many-a decade and move into Ben Stiller's prisoner of war camp-like run nursing home because of unpaid taxes. Consequently, big bucks on the pro-Golf tour seems to be the only way in which he can raise said funds. There's something quite pleasant, quite heart-felt about having to take up something new and as difficult as Golf for sake of those close to you, in the sense you're doing it all for them – but Happy Gilmore renders Golf something the lead has to do out of necessity, mocking those that play before taking it up himself and failing to undergo any significant on screen changes in terms of attitude. One wonders whether, at any point, he was ever enjoying what it was he was doing. In taking up Golf, antagonism born out of a rivalry with tour veteran Shooter McGavin (McDonald) arises, as does a friendship with Chubbs Peterson (Weathers) and a tour PR manager called Virginia Venit (Bowen) acts as a love interest.I think Happy was in love before; his relationship with a girl at the beginning is observed as he talks dirty down an apartment intercom as his girlfriend walks out on him for unspecified reasons. Given his temperament, something that we come to learn more of as the film progresses, I think it may have been because of one or two instances in which he struck her, but the harsh realities of why this relationship is now off is completely ignored when a frat-boy sight gag is inserted into the sequence. Later on, he'll be asked about what happened between them and he'll lie to them that she died. So, are we sort of behind Happy because he wants to help Grandma out? Or are we anti-Happy and his antics because he, quite possibility, beat up his ex-partner a few times? Then again, we probably dislike the character of Shooter McGavin more than Happy – a man that feels Happy is destroying Golf but then contradicts himself in hiring an individual to put Happy off his game. Everything clashes and just ends up being a bit of a mess, systematic of both the film and its content.Within the universe of the film, Gilmore can complete a round and head onto the next tour stop without ever having to face both the disturbing the peace and assault charges which would surely have been brought against him in the real world. The use of violence and destructive behaviour for sake of laughs is woefully misjudged in Happy Gilmore, turning fits of rage and destruction of objects items of near-slapstick. One sequence sees a fistfight between an elderly man and Happy on the golf course; one that should have ended in the hospitalisation of the elderly man and a jail term for Happy. However,the need for violence-infused laughs wins and this is not the outcome. There's something really distasteful in watching a fight between two people being taken to the level it is when, in reality, one of the two parties would be dead from their injuries.One wonders what Happy might've done, given his predicament involving his Grandmother, without the sport of Golf. He may have become a foot-soldier to a local crime boss – forever being sent out to break the fingers and arms of those that owe the kingpin money. Happy's describing of swearing, fighting and breaking things as ""fun"" captures the film's overall tone, and acts as a pass-key for the less informed viewers of the sick spectacle that is Happy Gilmore to additionally have fun – we're even treated to what it's like inside Happy's head, in which a bikini-clad Virginia and unicycle riding midgets rule the roost. For all its stupidity and ineptness, the final insult is that it all boils down to a 'final green' climax, in which very basic rules of Golf are twisted for sheer dramatic effect. A sad and depraved effort.",Happy Gilmore
31,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Easy-to-watch underdog sports comedy,6,15 December 2008,"A temperamental aspiring hockey star with no talent finds he has a gift for the game of golf and uses it to make enough money to buy his grandmother's house back. This has light- hearted sports comedy written all over it. Toss in the comedy of Adam Sandler and then you go from light-hearted to wacko and borderline stupid. Either way, ""Happy Gilmore"" is about as easy to watch as rain drops on a window.Like all collaborations between Sandler and director Dennis Dugan, ""Happy"" is full of strange characters (grandmas, midgets, awkwardly tall people) and stuck up, obnoxious antagonists (like Shooter McGavin) that make you like Sandler's terribly flawed character merely by default. Like many of his earlier films, ""Happy"" is one of Sandler's angry roles, where the physical comedy reigns supreme. Not his best gig, but amusing enough. The scene where he is learning to putt and takes his frustration out on a mini-golf robotic clown head pretty much sums it all up.There are a few humorous nuggets from this film that have a high place in the list of top Adam Sandler comedy lines/moments, like the fight with Bob Barker accompanied by the timeless ""the price is wrong, bitch."" Other than those few great lines and funny scenes, there isn't a whole lot to love about ""Happy Gilmore,"" but it acknowledges that and doesn't waste your time at just 90 minutes long.",Happy Gilmore
32,Anonymous_Maxine,"Adam Sandler has never been a real favorite of the critics, but Happy Gilmore is undeniably one of his most successfully hilarious comedies.",8,17 April 2002,"In Happy Gilmore, Sandler plays the part of a determined hockey player who doesn't make the team but soon inadvertently discovers that his hockey skills translate very nicely onto the golf green. Until the point in the film where Happy begins playing golf, most of the laughs come from his misfortune (`Happy Gilmore I called your name, didn't I?' [eagerly] `No, you didn't.' `Oh, well, better luck next year!!'), but it is the conflictive interaction between himself as a self-proclaimed hockey player and the much more formal and (for lack of a better word) high class game of golf that makes up the majority of the entertainment for the rest of the film.
There is clearly a take on the classic odd-couple comedy structure here, as Sandler's vulgar hockey habits collide with the neatness and formality of the golf green, and for the most part, this comedy scheme works pretty well here. Sandler seems to adopt the character of Happy Gilmore with great relish as he displays violent acts of hilariously misplaced aggression, clearly foreshadowing his similar actions as Bobby Boucher in The Waterboy. Indeed, some of the funniest parts of the film come from his lengthy streams of profanity at the misbehaved ball when it doesn't go where he wants it to go (`PIECE!! OF!! MONKEY *beep*!!'). So you have an undeniably entertaining and amusing character who does undeniably funny things, but it is at the logical level that this film falls on its face. Luckily for the movie and for its fans, this is not the most important element of a movie like this. It's not very likely that a slob like Happy, who doesn't make the hockey team, is going to suddenly find himself bringing in thousands and thousands of dollars left and right, and stick to his plan to buy his grandmother's house back. You would think that, having seen that he can make that much money, he would at least have kept going for a while instead of quitting as soon as he had accumulated enough to buy back the house. A noble cause, obviously, but no red blooded American male on the planet is going to just quit the game because he prefers hockey or he hates his lead opponent. But who cares? Sandler delivers the steady stream of laughs as Gilmore with such skill that the comedy of the film far overshadows any such imperfections. Gilmore himself seems to be a bit overly violent in scenes where it doesn't seem entirely necessary, and there is clearly some overdone product placement, but it doesn't take away from the rest of the film. Mike Meyers made brilliant use of product placement in Wayne's World in such ways that added hugely to the comedy of the film (although he tripped over this technique in Austin Powers 2, when he made it massively over-emphasized and stonily unamusing), and the excessive violence of the Gilmore character is justified (although just barely) by the fact that his imperfect characteristics make his efforts (or lack thereof) to fit in with professional golfers even more amusing. As the pros stand around sipping expensive wine and discussing their respective accomplishments, Happy walks in asking where the pinball machine and the keg are. They want fame and recognition, he wants money and beer (and Virginia, the sexy reporter who fills the role of the obligatory love interest in the typical Sandler film).
There are a lot of scenes in Happy Gilmore that, as much as I personally enjoy the movie, simply fall flat (many of which involve the homeless guy who Happy employs as his caddie, or the nutcase that Shooter McGavin employs to destroy Gilmore's chances of winning the tournament, or anything involving Chubbs' prosthetic hand) but the film succeeds where it is supposed to. Sandler presents Gilmore as a strangely likeable character, despite all of his destructive habits, and the film is peppered with other notable performances, not the least of which are by Carl Weathers as Chubbs, the former golf pro who takes upon himself the immense task of taming the wild Gilmore, and Christopher MacDonald, in yet another brilliantly hate-able role as the immutable Shooter McGavin. Happy Gilmore is a comedy from Adam Sandler, which means that you already know what kind of movie that you are going to get here, so don't complain if it turns out to be what you expected. Sandler does not make award-winning films, and chances are he never will, but the comedic value of Happy Gilmore is unquestionable. It is, to sum it up just as briefly as movies like this can be summed up, a perfect example of what I like to call Fast Food Cinema. It's a lot of fun, but there's no nutritional value.",Happy Gilmore
33,videorama-759-859391,Sandler tees off another hit,8,1 September 2014,"This film really took a rubbishing. Really you can take Adam Sandler or you can't take him. In his second lead effort, we're not really in it for the acting stakes, given his reputation as a thespian. This is a very funny and addictive movie, centered around a gifted golfer, Happy (Sandler) who can knocks balls off tees for amazing distances, but when it comes to accurate soft putting, and getting it in the hole, there lies his weakness. Sandler also ends up with another hottie, too, yes that ice skating scene was intimate. Going pro, he's also stealing the thunder from current champion (Mcdonald). Richard ""Jaws"" Kiel, missing a body part, marks a much absent and thankful return as Happy's ex boss, where Carl Weathers as Happy's tutor, meets a tragic end as a result of one of Sandler's stupid pranks. Near the end of the film, we're very much entering Caddyshack territory, as we know what's gonna ensue. Truly this is a goofy and inventive comedy, with some great gags. Definitely, to rent and take home, where most of you won't be disappointed, especially kids, which I truly recommend this to all.",Happy Gilmore

I really like this movie and I think it's a lighthearted comedy a lot of people would like.This movie is about a hockey player wannabe. He discovers that he has the most powerful golf drive in history, and decides to join the P.G.A. tour to make money, so he can save his Grandmother's house. Adorable. The downside is, his mentality is of a hockey player, not a golf player.

36,GOWBTW,Barker vs. Gilmore: That's what made it great!,8,17 February 2006,"This is one Adam Sandler movie that'll go down in the history books. He plays a ex-hockey player whose slap shot makes him a golf pro. I mean he's no Tiger Woods, but with a few lessons he'll be good. Happy Gilmore(Adam Sandler) would be playing pro-hockey, since he couldn't skate, his swing was the strong point of it all. I mean, if a person could swing, doesn't make him useless. Since Gilmore's skating handicapped him from the dream sport, golf club shaped like a hockey stick keeps him from being disillusioned. Chubbs Peterson(Carl Weathers, ""Action Jackson"", ""Predator"", and The ""Rocky"" Movies) is Happy's mentor. A football player-turned actor lost his hand to an alligator. Happy did get his revenge on the alligator, but his payback claims Chubbs' life as well. Then my favorite scene of all time is ""The Price is Right"" host Bob Barker battling Gilmore in a brawl, which I think is outstanding, and hilarious as well. This movie is what Barker calls is his ""revenge"" since he took karate lessons from Chuck Norris. WHAT A PAYOFF! That's one game-show host I wouldn't p--- off! All the way, this movie rocks. See it for yourself. Being a ""Price is Right"" fan, I wouldn't miss it for the world. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",Happy Gilmore
37,freemantle_uk,"It may be one of Adam Sandler's better films, but still not that great",5,10 December 2015,"1996's Happy Gilmore is often regarded as one of Adam Sandler's best comedy, a film with a solid fanbase. It is deserving of that status, being more tolerable then his later offerings.Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, a Bostonian man who aspiring ice hockey player who has no skating abilities and anger management problems, but has a killer slap shot. When his grandmother's home is repossess by the IRS Happy turns his talents to golf and quickly becomes a sensation. But his angry persona and blue collar roots results in Happy making enemies on the Pro Golf Tour.Despite the praise Happy Gilmore received it is a standard Sandler film, having moments of violent slapstick and angry outbursts, a mega-douchy villain, a love interest and having some sort of family element. Fortunately Sandler's more crass and overly sentimental material is not evident like it is his later films, nor is its message as harass like I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. Happy Gilmore's problem is simply the humour is not funny or consistent enough. There is no dept the humour on offer or the slapstick lacks invention. The best moment is when Happy has a fight with Bob Barker but it is really a joke for an American audience. The most noticeable thing about the film's direction is its exaggerated sound effects when Happy hits a golf ball or when someone gets hit.Happy Gilmore has a standard sports movie storyline which in the perfectly acceptable for a comedy; it gets the job done even its story is predictable. At least there was some variation because of the family story, Happy's attempts to romance the tour's head of PR and the clash of culture between Happy's unfiltered personal style compared to the refined, upper class world of professional golf. Happy is responsible for a working-class, beer drinking audience coming to watch golf, wanting a show and outbursts, shaking up the natural order of the golfing world.Happy Gilmore was made before the worst excesses of Sandler's career, but his shtick was hardly great to begin with. There are many better comedies of this style out there.",Happy Gilmore
38,drqshadow-reviews,"Unapologetically Silly, Short-Sighted and Superficial... and I Love it",7,28 January 2020,"Recipe for a prime Adam Sandler comedy: dream up a ridiculous, one-note concept, plaster it with silly side gags, stretch the whole thing to fill ninety minutes and... somehow succeed in spite of yourself. There's no way this rudimentary formula should work so well, but here's Exhibit B, and I'm still laughing.Sandler in the mid-90s was a roiling ocean of slapstick brilliance, totally superficial and meaningless but all the more endearing for it. Here, of course, he's the brainless hockey player turned golf pro, capable of driving the green on a par five but allergic to any semblance of a short game. It's a role catered to his strengths - quick temper tantrums, wacky fight scenes, childish infatuations - and he still plays them well. All the fleeting extraneous bits land, too, from Carl Weathers's absurdly long false hand to Lee Trevino's frequent, often wordless, cameos to Christopher McDonald's delicious overacting as the stuck-up front runner, Shooter McGavin.It doesn't look great (actually, the budget must've been pretty tight) but that's hardly the point.

39,jimbo-53-186511,"Neither screamingly funny nor particularly clever, but it still manages to be reasonably enjoyable",6,25 June 2021,"Ever since he was a little boy Happy Gilmore only ever wanted to be a professional hockey player. Over the years, Happy has tried repeatedly to hit the big time, but has faced continual setbacks. Then by chance, Happy discovers that he has a gift at hitting a golf ball over an incredible distance which catches the eye of former professional golfer Chubbs Peterson. In the meantime, Happy's grandma is facing eviction and needs a huge chunk of change in order to keep her home. When Happy realises he can potentially make a lot of money as a golfer, he sticks with it in an attempt to raise the cash to save his grandma's house, but unscrupulous pro golfer Shooter McGavin is determined to do everything in his power to stop Happy from winning...Undoubtedly there is a certain absurdity to the actual plot in this film; it's based on a man being able to hit a golf ball twice as far as your average Joe which, in theory, is possible but highly unlikely. Still if you can overlook the slightly flawed premise then the film itself isn't actually too bad.Most of the good stuff is derived from Happy himself and his unhinged volatile persona. Sandler can be good when he gets the balance of character and humour right and I felt as though he did here. Sure it's fair to say that Gilmore is not exactly 'role model' material, but his short-fuse is bore more out of frustration and a desire to succeed than plain nastiness.Some of the cast are able to bring a bit extra to the table and lift the film somewhat; Carl Weathers was a good supporting character worlds away from macho types that he's portrayed in the past and showed here that he can do comedy. Richard Kiel once again used his towering physique to scare the beep out of Happy's rival; Kiel was limited with what he could do in this film after being badly injured in a car accident, but even with these limitations he was good in the screen time that he was afforded.In fairness it is easy to pick holes in some aspects of the story; Sandler's temperament was a contributory factor in him never having a career as a hockey player yet this same behaviour is ultimately tolerated as he advances through the golf hierarchy (OK it's not tolerated in its entirety, but Happy is never 'kicked off the tour so to speak'). However, there's a nice arc to the story in that Happy is only trying to make all the money to save his grandma's house that these flaws never really matter and despite Happy's crazed behaviour he's never unlikeable which is why I've given the film a fair score. Also Happy's bad behaviour is also tolerated as it keeps viewers tuned in providing the film with a sort of social commentary which again gives the film a bit of a lift.Happy Gilmore won't have you rolling around on the floor laughing, nor will it provide you with anything particularly clever or surprising, but it has some funny moments and a good natured premise which overall make Happy Gilmore a fairly enjoyable film.",Happy Gilmore

45,framptonhollis,A Fun Movie,6,29 August 2015,"Adam Sandler, before he was infamous for making some of the worst movies of all time! This is one of the Sandler movies that people add as an exception after insulting Adam Sandler's film career. I mean, it is really funny! It's unlike most of Sandler's other movies because of how hilarious it was, and Sandler was actually pretty good in the role, as, pretty much, a sociopath who plays golf!Although it is very funny, the movie is predictable, and it is really a by-the-numbers 90s comedy. It has the bully character, the unneeded romance, an old lady ""sidekick"", etc. I mean, if you just gave me a detailed synopsis of the plot, without any major spoilers, I would probably be able to tell you exactly what happens in the movie, plot wise, but that doesn't make it bad, because it's funny, and, in a comedy, that is all that really matters.",Happy Gilmore
46,Rob_Taylor,Harmless fun and entertaining.,7,1 October 2003,"I must admit, I sat down to watch this movie expecting to see the Sandler trademark character who has mental/emotional problems. Whilst this is true to the extent that Happy Gilmore has chronic anger management issues, it falls short of the usual ""character who has no grasp of the real world"" which so often has predominated in Sandler films. Instead, Happy is savvy enough to know when he's being mocked and more than Happy (no pun intended) to beat the crap out of anyone who does so.The story is entirely predictable. However, you don't mind this, as with such films, the fun and entertainment comes not from being uncertain what is going to happen next, but rather from the anticipation of what you know will happen in due course.All the cast give great comic performances, though I felt more use could have been made of Sandler's homeless caddy. For the most part he just stands around. Likewise, Ben Stiller's minor role of the evil nursing home attendant ended rather abruptly. I was expecting a showdown between Stiller and Sandler over the former's treatment of Sandler's grandmother, but it never happened. I suspect this was a cut-scene, as I can't imagine the two of them not seeing the great potential in such a confrontation.The only really negative thing I can say about this movie (and it is really a generic failing of Hollywood that I've noticed in several movies lately) is the reliance on audience knowledge of cameo characters in order to get laughs. Just who is Bob Barker? I have no idea and I suspect a lot of the non-American audience will have no idea either. To me the whole fight scene on the golf course between Sandler and Barker was nowhere near as funny as I imagine it would be if I had any inkling of who he (Barker) was.But overall the film delivers plenty of gentle humour and the occasional guffaw. Well worth a look, even if you've been turned off by Sandler's characters in the past. For me, Sandler has taken a turn (albeit a modest one) in the right direction with his characters here.",Happy Gilmore
47,eric262003,Back In a Time When Sandler Was More Risky,8,30 July 2013,"Back in the 1990's there was a time when Adam Sandler was one of the leading funny men. The two standout films that starred Adam Sandler at the time was ""Billy Madison"" and this one here ""Happy Gilmore"".was the metaphoric jumper cable that electrified Mr. Sandler's acting career. For the past decade and a half, Sandler's movies have been simple in plot, but they are never short on entertainment and you become quite passive over the surreal moments. ""Happy Gilmore is by far no exception to the rule.Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, a young energetic hockey player with a big problem, he can't skate. Happy is raised by his grandmother after his father was killed after a severe slap shot to the head. When government officials discover that his grandmother owes them $270,000 in taxes. they raid her house and repossess every on of her belongings that even includes the house. And that they'll only get it back if they can find a way to pay the money they owe.With his hockey career being null and void, Happy seems his chances of getting back her loot is virtually impossible. As the movers carry their possessions, one of the moving men starts up a bet to Happy that happy couldn't strike a golf ball farther than him. Much to even Happy's surprise he actually has the amazing ability to to drive the ball well over 400 yards. This inspires Happy who continues to gain impressions on spectators including Chubbs (Carl Weathers) who was an ex golfer whose career was cut short by an alligator bite. on his hand.Chubbs persuades Happy to compete in a local tournament and if he succeeds, he will be eligible to compete in the PGA tournament. And so Happy emerges victorious and brings a volatile demeanour and mean drive as well as a very strong fan following. But his short-tempered attitude almost gets him kicked off the tournament due to his gratuitous cursing and destroying clubs. With the help from Chubbs he progressively tones down his act and even his payroll starts to materialize. During the tournament, Happy becomes a hated rival by a top player named Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) McGavin takes the sport seriously while at the same time looks down on all the competitors due to his condescending nature.There is not very much thought put into the movie, but that could all be forgiven because it's hilarious and brilliantly scripted. and after ""Billy Madison"" this is the second funniest film that Sandler ever performed. This is definitely a movie you don't want to miss out. It's hilarious, easy to follow along and even if you don't like golf it's still fun to watch.",Happy Gilmore
48,JLRMovieReviews,Many Viewings Are Required!,6,18 July 2016,"Ever since he was a young boy, Adam Sandler wanted to be a hockey player. His hot temper and uncontrollable rages fit the sport, but then he is taken off the team. When the IRS takes his grandmother's (actress Frances Bay) house for back taxes, he vows to make enough money to buy it back. Ultimately, he takes up golf to win the tournament money. But golfer and rival Christopher McDonald has something to say about that. (Christopher plays his role memorably and mercilessly well.) For some reason, I had been avoiding Adam Sandler movies like the plague, since most of his humor is usually childish, infantile, dumb, silly, etc. I must have seen something years ago to have come to this conclusion, But recently I decided to watch a few. After finding out that this movie and ""Billy Madison"" were his best, I saw them. I think most people would agree that the highlight of this film is Bob Barker and him duking it out on the golf course. But parts of this seemed too silly and/or dumb, like him trying constantly to shake Carl Weathers' wooden hand. My main criticism of this film is that most of its one-liners, jokes, or scenarios fall flat resulting in little to no reaction other than shock, which gets in the way of enjoying the film, along with his almost-hostile disposition due to his love of hockey. But he does agree to cool it down and act more professional. A lot of people would say to take ""Happy Gilmore"" for what it is, not to think about it too much and not take it so seriously and just enjoy yourself and let it come over you, the whole experience. A second viewing is needed for this experiment! Oh, boy!",Happy Gilmore
49,michaeltrivedi,Okay,6,30 November 2019,"Happy Gilmore was alright. Not as good as Billy Madison. It has some funny parts. Some downers too. The whole golfing thing gets kinda boring. There's politics being played which you lose interest in. And Sandler's character is not really that cool. Just a normal perhaps aggressive guy. The hockey player type. It was alright, but of course definitely watchable.The movie is about a guy who knows how to play hockey, who joins a golf tournament so he could win money to pay off his grandmothers home debts. Chaos ensues at the golfing tournament.It's an alright watch. It's definitely better than some of the other stuff on. I like Adam Sandler. Even his bad movies are ones I've watched many times.I'd recommend watching it.6 stars",Happy Gilmore

Although he has undeniably been in some stinkers, I've always liked Sandler and found him funny.It's the same old Sandler formula in 'Happy Gilmore' - silly characters, a ridiculous story and plenty of dumb jokes. Exactly what you would expect, but it does serve a purpose as a piece of light-entertainment and it does consistently provide laughs, which should be how any comedy movie is judged.Overall, 'Happy Gilmore' is definitely one of Adam Sandler's better movies. It's fun and entertaining, and that's really all you can ask for from a film like this.",Happy Gilmore

53,Beta_Gallinger,One of Adam Sandler's stronger films,8,3 March 2009,"This 1996 film, starring comedian Adam Sandler, was released the year after ""Billy Madison"", also starring Sandler. I didn't see either of those two famous films from start to finish until years after their release. I saw all of ""Billy Madison"" for the first time in 2003, and don't recall being too pleased. I finally watched ""Happy Gilmore"" in 2006, and definitely thought it was better than its predecessor. Watching ""Billy Madison"" again this year, I was more impressed than I was before, but still found some of it a tad embarrassing. Overall, it was a mixed blessing for me that time. After my second viewing of that film, I watched ""Happy Gilmore"" again, and I definitely still prefer it. In fact, it may have been just a bit better to me than it was the first time.Happy Gilmore is a wannabe hockey player who was raised by his grandmother. He has failed in his attempts to make the professional league due to his lack of skating skills and trouble controlling his temper. His grandmother hasn't paid her taxes in years, and owes a total of $270,000 to the IRS. Because of this, she is evicted from her house (a house which Happy claims his grandfather built with his bare hands), and is forced to live in a retirement home, which is secretly run as a sweatshop! Happy must find a way to make $270,000 in time, before the house is sold, and discovers how far he can hit golf balls. Soon after ex-golf pro Chubbs Peterson sees his skill, and leads him into professional golf, only because Happy knows this is a chance to make money and save his grandmother's house. He turns out to be a huge hit on the pro golf tour, but his aggressive tendencies may be a problem here as well, and golfing champion Shooter McGavin is determined to bring him down! Sandler played the same kind of character in this film as he did in ""Billy Madison"", a goofy, immature maniac. Both films are pretty silly, but this one doesn't get QUITE as puerile as its predecessor (for example, no pants wetting gags here), and while not every single gag in this film made me laugh, none of them actually embarrassed me, which some of the gags in Sandler's 1995 film seemed to do. In ""Happy Gilmore"", the comedian made me laugh quite a few times, sometimes hard, with his antics in the lead role, involving slapstick and insanity. Highlights for me included his tirade on the golf course and some fights he gets into, including one with game show host Bob Barker. While Sandler provides most of the humour, some of the other cast members can also be funny, such as Joe Flaherty in his bit part as the ""Jeering Fan"", there to make Happy Gilmore's game more difficult.During Adam Sandler's film career, he has had some big hits as well as flops. It seems this one turned out to be one of his successful films, which I would say it deserved to be, unlike, let's say, the 2002 feature-length cartoon, ""Eight Crazy Nights"", which deservingly tanked. As usual with films starring the former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian, this one is crude and rather juvenile, though certainly not as juvenile as some of his other films. I guess that's one of the things I like about it. Unlike some of Sandler's comedies, including ""Billy Madison"", and even more so the rather disgusting ""Eight Crazy Nights"", this one doesn't tend to overdo the puerile humour. Still, it's not for everybody, including those who hate the comedian who plays the main character here, but for fans of his who want a laugh, this film has been good for that through the years.",Happy Gilmore
54,educallejero,"Less terrible than Billy Madison, and still bad",2,31 October 2020,"Even with more relatively ok jokes in this one, on paper, the reality is that they just don't land, either because the executions fails (mostly Sandler) or because they are surrounded of tons of other bad jokes.The story is just a bunch of ""sports movie clichés"" put together without any effort, with us having to make the effort to ""connect the clichés"" and accept any character development as obvious and clear, even when is never shown on screen. I know, ""it's a comedy"". About that...If you find the lazy jokes funny enough, then yes, this movie moves fast enough to entertain you. But if you are like me and just don't laugh with Sandler as easily, then you won't find pretty much anything, because again, there is nothing clever in this ""satire"".

Maybe it's my own sick form of punishment. Maybe I hold on to a little hope that the film might be good. I don't know, but with Happy Gilmore I got exactly what I was expecting. It's a stupid, goofy, brainless comedy that has all of the cheapest and lamest kinds of jokes rolled up together in a big ball of suck.Adam Sandler stars in the title role as a wannabe hockey player who finds out he has a ridiculously strong golf swing. He uses this ability to compete in golf tournaments, saving the prize money for his grandma who was recently evicted from her home because she owed the IRS $270,000. Happy gets himself into all sorts of wacky situations on his way to the money, encountering all sorts of strange and eccentric characters both friendly and not so friendly. However, the result of all this silliness... not funny.Happy Gilmore is a film that tries so desperately to be funny. That's all it wants to accomplish. It only wants to make its audience laugh, and that's what any comedy film like this should want to do. But Happy Gilmore fails at doing that, at least for me. It's not funny, only stupid. It's your basic Adam Sandler idiocracy that is just as unfunny in this film as it is in the rest of his screwball comedies.The film has all the things that make a screwball comedy what it is today. It has a ridiculous plot, unbelievable characters, and impossible character relationships. These are the things that seem to make these kinds of comedies tick, and there is really something wrong with that. Then you add the fact that the character of Happy is a total jerk and incredibly unlikeable it just sets up Happy Gilmore to be a disaster of a film. I may have laughed once or twice, and I didn't hate the film enough to turn it off, but it really is an awful film.",Happy Gilmore

Except those times when fans are taunting him or running onto the golf course, that is.And when you add a celebrity television star who can beat the crap out of him, it's just that much better. Bob Barker plays a cameo role in ""Happy Gilmore"" who gets fed up with Happy's game of golf, which ends them up in last place.The only reason Happy even played the game was to help his sweet old grandmother get her house back.

58,eminkl,"This one remains a simple dose of energetic fun, twenty-odd years later",7,17 April 2020,"Recipe for a prime Adam Sandler comedy: dream up a ridiculous, one-note concept, plaster it with silly side gags, stretch the whole thing to fill ninety minutes and... somehow succeed in spite of yourself. There's no way this rudimentary formula should work so well, but here's Exhibit B, and I'm still laughing. Sandler in the mid-90s was a roiling ocean of slapstick brilliance, totally superficial and meaningless but all the more endearing for it. Here, of course, he's the brainless hockey player turned golf pro, capable of driving the green on a par five but allergic to any semblance of a short game. It's a role catered to his strengths - quick temper tantrums, wacky fight scenes, childish infatuations - and he still plays them well. All the fleeting extraneous bits land, too, from Carl Weathers's absurdly long false hand to Lee Trevino's frequent, often wordless, cameos to Christopher McDonald's delicious overacting as the stuck-up front runner, Shooter McGavin.

74,The_Light_Triton,A Comedy that's only blotched by one single flaw,9,3 October 2016,"Adam Sandler, whether you love him or hate him, he still makes movies and this one is arguably his best. He crossed the blue-blooded traditions of golf with the rabid, blue-collared style of hockey, and brings about a comedy that is still loved to this day.Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is a failed hockey player who has a sweet heart but a short temper. That, and a slapshot that could send a puck through 6 inches of Kevlar. While his grandmother's house has been repossessed by the IRS, But in his words ""A house my grandfather built with his bare hands."" Happy learns that his mean slapshot translates into a 400+ yard golf drive, something that has never been seen before. With a few strokes of luck, Happy gets an opportunity to get his grandmother's house back by joining the golf tour, With the support of tour coordinator Virginia Venit (Julie Bowen) and legendary golf pro Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers) but he's got a rival in Shooter McGavin (Christopher MacDonald) the leading money winner who has never won a gold jacket, as well as a lifelong enemy in Price is Right gameshow host, Bob Barker. Now this movie is downright hilarious. From Happy's antics on the golf course, to his unbelievable showdown with Bob Barker, It is a riot of laughter and humor. But as I mentioned in the summary, There's one single flaw that this movie could've done without.In-film advertisements. If you didn't notice, Pepsi and Subway commercials are littered throughout the film. The arena where Happy tries out for his local hockey team has Pepsi clocks. Happy brings Subway home for his girlfriend. Shooter asks specifically for a diet Pepsi from Virginia. Happy Gilmore is teamed up with Bob Barker on the Pepsi Pro-Am. Happy gets $50,000 from doing a Subway commercial, and gets free Subway for life. There's Subway logos littered all over the tournament championship course.And it gets worse - if you watch the heavily censored TV version of this movie, the editors removed almost all of the product references in the movie's dialogue, but the worst edit is the logo on Happy's subway shirt. The editing they did is blatantly obvious. Other movies had obvious product placement in them too (GMC trucks in Lethal Weapon 2, Pepsi in Home Alone, McDonalds in Big Daddy) But here it's overdone.At any rate, it's a comedy that's achieved a cult status and it's possibly the best film Adam Sandler's ever done.

77,CinematicInceptions,Prototypical Sandler movie. Well blended comedy with memorable characters.,7,22 March 2015,"Although it isn't the most incredible cinematic work to ever come out of Hollywood, it is understandable how Happy Gilmore is one of the mostly widely enjoyed comedies out there. It lacks a good story and has all of the trademarks of a standard Sandler movie, but it hits several areas of comedy that can please a lot of people with different comedic tastes.The storyline is structured much like Billy Madison with Sandler starting off as a burnout and going through some trials to achieve a goal and beat a villain that comes up partway through. Several points of the story feature rather far-fetched outcomes to hopeless scenarios. The plot is pretty weak in its gradual development with Shooter McGavin, and the movie might have been better off without any plot, but even in comedies, there has to be some kind of plot.None of the characters, like the storyline, have a whole lot of depth. Sandler's character has a much different personality from Billy Madison, but he, as always, has some goofy remarks, witty remarks, over the top antics, and spats of anger. Happy Gilmore is pretty much the character that all other Sandler characters are based off of. Grandma, Virginia, Chubbs, and Shooter McGavin have personality, but not arcs. Grandma losing her house is basically the driving force of the story, and we can see that she matters a lot to Happy. Virginia is primarily present to keep Happy from letting his hockey instincts get out of hand, and ends up as his girlfriend without realistic reason. Chubbs is a pretty likable character and is a rather pivotal besides. Shooter McGavin, while not an interesting villain like Heath Ledger's Joker or action movie villains, is still a great antagonist because of his ability to be such a hateable and passive-aggressive jerk. There are also a lot of small but memorable characters that Happy plays golf with or around, such as Bob Barker, his two caddy's, the obnoxious fan at the celebrity tournament, Mr. Larson, and the guy that talks about the golf ball's energy.As I said before, the comedy reaches several regions, though it maintains a constant goofy and blatant feel. Some of it's crude, but not as much as in, say, Anger Management. There is a good balance of situational and verbal humor. Basically every character, big and small, that has a line brings some kind of comedy in their screen time. Even the golf channel announcers, who are scripted like real sports announcers, contribute humor. Probably what sets this movie apart is its ability to bring a diversity of comedy into each individual scene. Not everything in every scene will strike you as funny, but there will probably be a couple of laughs in each.A quick word on the execution. The visual quality and cinematography with Happy's insane shots are nothing special, but somehow add to the general mood. The acting and scripting are debatable, as in most comedies, but you can tell that every actor fits their respective character.Again, this is pretty much the prototypical Sandler comedy so if you have liked any of his other movies, apart from maybe Airheads, this should be at least somewhat enjoyable. It doesn't take a high IQ to appreciate, and can be seen under almost any circumstances. I would recommend watching it on a road trip if the audience isn't too young. If you don't mind a little ridiculousness, it's worth a rental. Overall Rating: 8.2/10.",Happy Gilmore
78,Flagrant-Baronessa,"It's not Caddyshack, but it's quality comedy",8,29 July 2006,"Happy Gilmore is Adam Sandler's only standout performance in a long list of half-assed, unfunny comedies. But this is it, the real deal. This is the film that all other Sandler films make references to, quote and celebrate, in case you ever wondered where phrases like ""It's all in the hips"" (as said in Little Nicky) and ""You eat pieces of sh*t for breakfast?"" (quoted everywhere) came from. Well, Happy Gilmore is the birth of these phrases as well as the birth of a comedic star. It is also just all-around solid comedic entertainment and a crash-course in golf. Or rather, 101 Things Not To Do On The Golf Course.Adam Sandler is Happy. But this is only his character's ironic name, because Happy is really quite angry and extremely frustrated at getting nowhere in his amateur hockey career. He slips into golf by what can only be described as a fluke, and is able to take out his aggressions on the golf-court, setting records for longest drives ever as he aggressively hits the ball. The anger he has is advantageous here, but a big problem when it comes to putting - and an even bigger problem when it comes to dealing with smug competitors like Shooter McGavin (superbly played by Christopher McDonald).Happy Gilmore thus follows Sandler on the golf-court, where 90% of the film takes place. Happy is one of those rare characters in films that you desperately pull for and end up hating all of his competitors and enemies. In this way, Happy Gilmore is a very effective film as it establishes a hero-feeling with its main character, in spite of his flaws. I can't think of many other films in which I've wanted the lead character to win as much as in this one. On top of that device, you have such gems like Adam Sandler beating up old man Bob Barker on the green, Adam Sandler screaming at a golf ball asking it ""Are you too good for your home?"", and Christopher McDonald in one of the most hilarious and subtlety comedic performances of the 1990s.So Happy Gilmore is the Godfather of all Sandler films, as well as the only truly good one. It borrows somewhat from Caddyshack in the goofy golf sense so it can't be considered truly original, but it IS original when it comes to Happy Madison productions.8/10",Happy Gilmore

And you can almost tell he has your back. That's soooo rare in cinema.My favorite is definitely Julie!! She delivers a smart woman, but also an easily lovable one. Her expressions and smile.

84,mOVIemAN56,Funny? Yes. Pointless? Yes.,9,12 May 2005,"Happy Gilmore is one of my top ten favorite comedies and brings out what little humor their is in golf. It's the best golf comedy since Caddyshack (1980) and really puts you in the golfing spirit. Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is the grandson of loving grandmother Gilmore (Frances Bay). He is in love with hockey but can't break into the roster of the local hockey team. After being cut he returns home to find his girlfriend leaving him. After a crazy night with a Japanese lady, Happy gets a call from his grandma saying that she is being evicted.Happy doesn't know what to do so he takes her to the local nursing home run by a psycho orderly (Ben Stiler). Happy goes back to the house to make sure everything is going alright to find the movers playing golf. Happy tells them to go back to work but say that they're on break. Happy says that if he can hit a golf ball past the two guys than they go back to work.Happy does more than that by hitting the ball 300+ yards and hitting two people at the end of the street. Happy, after meeting Chubbs (Carl Weathers), goes to the Waterbury open where he nearly kills his caddy because he thinks he's getting robbed. After winning he is on the pro tour and ready to get his grandma's house back.Along the way, Happy must deal with pro Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), Bob Barker (Himself), and hostile fans who he ends up beating the hell out of. Happy is kind at heart but has problems with anger when frustrated or unhappy. One of the funniest scenes involves Bob Barker saying he should be working at the snack bar and Happy head butts him.The story is just plain old fish out of water story with some unforgettable laughs. Happy's official caddy is the best part as a hobo bathing in the 8th holes pond or washing his underwear in the ball washer.This film is funny, it's attractive, and it really brought Sandler into acting. The golf scenes are pretty well filmed and accurate with real golf. Chris McDonald is sinister as the hostile pro competing for the Gold Jacket and Richard Kiel is hilarious in his cameo as Happy's ex-boss turned loving fan.Happy Gilmore.

88,rollernerd,Just tap it in,5,20 December 2020,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the sports comedy flick Happy Gilmore (1996) starring Sandman as the title character who always dreamt of playing pro ice hockey but theres one thing he keeps forgetting - he cant skate and sucks at the game. But he soon discovers he may have a talent for a completely different sport - golf. Happy forcefully enters a tournament so he can win his grandmother's house back. But Happy has another problem - his short fused temper, which isn't really allowed in the sport of golf, so Happy must find a Happy place to avoid getting kicked out of the prize winning tournament. Throughout the film Happy gets into fights every few minutes, resulting in lame, cartoonish blows to the face and also to Sandler's personal ego. This film had a few laughs including the intercom tune of ""I want to kiss you all over and over again"" between Sandman and literally the public, his foul mouthed antics between anybody and anything on the golf course and Ben Stiller's small cameo appearance of Hal - the orderly bloke with the interesting 70 stache. The film looses its spark towards the end and doesn't delivery anything new or unique and also what happens with Hal?? A funny moment by Carl ""Apollo"" Weather as Chubs and also watch out for Otto the homeless Caddy - a regular member of Sandman's entourage. Definitely not one of Sandman's best but still a funny flick, what lets the movie down is the repetitive slapstick humor and the simple ending, overall 5.8/10",Happy Gilmore

1. The comedy is utterly hilarious and it never fails to produce raucous laughter.
2. The costume design is great as it perfectly mirrors the character's personalities, in addition to serving as a constant visual reminder that Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) doesn't belong to the golfing crowd.
3. Adam Sandler gives a patchy performance: he's at his best when let loose to act as crazy as he wants.
4. The soundtrack is slightly basic and generic, but it does add a fun and lively feel to the film.
5. Happy Gilmore undergoes a nice and succinct character development as he learns to control his anger and mature.
6. Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) is on the receiving end of an adverse physical and psychological ending.Cons:
1. The sound effects whenever the golf ball is hit, or whenever a punch is thrown, is needlessly corny.
2. Shooter McGavin is wholly one-dimensional which makes the conflict between him and Happy Gilmore feel rather hollow.
3. Adam Sandler delivers a patchy performance: he's far too wooden in the intimate and emotional moments.
4. The death of Chubbs (Carl Weathers) is cheapened as it's over-the-top and comedic.",Happy Gilmore

Since it's about golf, that makes it a comedy.""He also complained that it was more of a product placement for Subway sandwiches than a golfing movie.It's kind of ironic,in this case, that it has a 7/10 on IMDB and may arguably be known as Adam Sandler's best work. While I prefer Billy Madison, I agree that this IS when of his finest works.Happy Gilmore is about that person, who has a huge passion for hockey. He plays, but he does not really have good skills. But he does have good skills with golf, and when he learns he can golf to save his Grandmother's house, he goes on a golfing tour against a pro golfer. The problem is his temper gets in the way.Any one who has seen an Adam Sandler movie can know what to expect: Stupid humor is the main thing. Happy Gilmore has a lot, but it's still pretty funny.

I only watched this as it came on TV & I couldn't find the remote to turn it over or be bothered to get up.However, whereas the humour content in his other films are 'absolutely nil' this was just 'nil' so I suppose it was his funniest I've seen to date.I know it was only a film but the lack of golfing knowledge by the writers shone through more than anything. Countless errors & ignorance of rules. Nor can I take any film seriously where the lead character is called 'Happy' and the golfing pro is called 'Shooter'. Also Sandler again unrealistically pulled a gorgeous woman, despite the hinderance of him being a right prat which seems to go unnoticed amongst the women in his films. All of that I could've put up with though.
Unfortunately however, he AGAIN managed to irritate beyond belief with his usual trait, ie his idea of comedy consisting entirely of talking in a slow gormless voice. Somebody needs to tell him this mimic of a slow learner which crops up in all his films, ceases to be funny when the viewer reaches 3 year old.Despite all that though I saw it through to the end, without wanting to vomit (except the scenes mentioned above) & I remained interested, so for that: 4/10",Happy Gilmore

Simple humor, occasionally funny voices, a regular guy doing something great, either on a big stage event, or merely passing high school. Happy Gilmore may be the most consistently funny of the Adam Sandler movies as a failed hockey player finds out he can hit a golf ball 350 yards and tries to earn enough money to buy back his beloved grandmother's house from the IRS. Simple plot, surrounded by funny performances from Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed from the Rocky movies) as golf teacher Chubbs and Christopher McDonald as the smug professional golfer Shooter McGavin. And just for fun, Lee Trevino makes brief, and funny, appearances throughout the film. The signature scene of the film is when Happy Gilmore (Sandler) plays golf with Bob Barker (yes, that Bob Barker from The Price Is Right) get into a fistfight over who is play golf well or not. It would have been in poor taste if Happy were to beat up Barker, but since it goes the other way around, it has a certain comic genius to it and saves what could have been an uncomfortable moment. The golf highlights are all long shots and fancy editing, Gimore slices almost every tee shot, but through the magic of movies, we don't see that happening. It's funny throughout the movie, not laugh out loud funny from start to finish, but there are a lot of chuckles, the story is cute, and it is not as crude as other Sandler movies are. It's sweet, cute, and most importantly, funny enough to maintain the entertainment value all the way through.",Happy Gilmore

I don't know about you, but with someone as gorgeous as Julie Bowen next to me, golf would be the very last thing on my mind! She must be one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen in the movies.The film offers run of the mill Zero to Hero schmaltz and from the word 'Go' we are left with no uncertainty of how it will turn out, but his journey to the final championship, is a cleverly written comedy with strong performances from all involved most notably by Christopher McDonald as Gilmore's arrogant and devious opponent Shooter Mcgavin.McGavin will stop at nothing to finally win his much coveted Gold Jacket and his interplay with Gilmore as he tries all sorts of ways to have him removed from the tournament is hilarious, and provides the film with most of the gags.However what I found to be the most gut wrenchingly funniest moment in the picture, was the old man at the ice rink as he solemnly mimes the words to Endless Love. Brilliant.Look out for a wonderful and hilarious scene where Happy has a violent punch up with American game show host Bob Barker and a great cameo from Ben Stiller as the sadistic nursing home orderly.One question though.

Adam Sandler, Christopher McDonald, Julie Bowen, Frances Bay, Carl Weathers, Ben Stiller (cameo), Bob Barker. Very funny vehicle for bad boy Sandler, about a loser who strives to be a hockey player. When his grandma loses her home to the IRS, he joins the pro golf tour to make enough money to buy it back. While Sandler delivers a terrific performance (and is aided by excellent supporting actors McDonald and Weathers), the show-stealer is Ben Stiller, as an evil nursing home manager. Best scene: the ""landscaping duty"" scene at the nursing home. RATING: 8 out of 10. Rated PG-13 for violence, strong language, and comic sexual themes.",Happy Gilmore

108,chucknorrisfacts,Sandler's best,7,27 April 2010,"To me, ""Happy Gilmore"" is Adam Sandler's best work. If you've never seen it before, you'll be laughing your you know what off throughout the movie. I only wish Sandler had continued making stuff like this instead of turning out bombs like ""Little Nicky"", ""Mr. Deeds"" and lest we forget, ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"".Happy Gilmore is a wannabe hockey player, but there's just one problem -- he's not any good. Sure, his dad taught him the secret of slapping the greatest slap shot, but Happy's inability to skate well pretty much renders him useless in the hockey rink. After the IRS threatens to take his grandmother's house away after her failure to pay her taxes, Happy is determined to earn enough money to buy back her house from the government. He soon discovers his talents are better suited to golf than hockey, and earns a slot on a professional tour. From there, hilarity ensues. I won't give away any more than that.I definitely recommend checking this one out, but I'll admit that I've seen it so many times over the years that it's not as funny now as it used to be, namely because I know it by heart and know everything that's coming before it happens. However, it'll still provide several viewings of entertainment for you and your friends, or whoever you end up watching it with.",Happy Gilmore

Where else can you see Adam Sandler get into a fight with Bob Barker?  Although the plot is lacking any sort of major depth, the comedic writing is well-crafted and well-edited.  Adam Sandler is one of the most-talented comedic actors on the planet whether or not the movies he star in are good or bad.  Underrated by critics but loved by fans everywhere, it gets a 9 out of 10!PS:  This was his best movie before ""Mr. Deeds"" and the best golf comedy after ""Caddyshack""!",Happy Gilmore
110,Caleb_Everett,Sandler's Best,8,8 March 2019,"Happy Gilmore is, in my opinion, Sandler's best movie.It's the right amount of Sandler absurdity while mixing in honest true emotions every now and then. That coupled with the fact that the film gives us one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Golf antagonist of all time, Shooter McGavin. The polarizing attitudes of the two really sell this and make it a fun movie.For me, the only downfall of this movie is that we are supposed to believe that all it takes to be a golf pro is the ability to hit the ball really hard...I know, I know, that's what makes the movie comedic, but you can still have a comedy that exists in the real world (it's my opinion).A fantastic film and it's Sandler at absolute best will definitely watch again.",Happy Gilmore

None are particularly well-written or directed brilliantly but that didn't matter during this era of Sandler films. This film is hilarious and timeless. It has some of the funniest on screen jokes and scenes that I have ever seen. It is endlessly rewatchable because of the charisma of a young Adam Sandler. With an all time great movie villain, Shooter Mcgavin, you just cant go wrong in watching this movie for a pure fun time. I've probably seen this film over 100 times and it still entertains the crap out of me. I can't judge this film from an artistic perspective, because the cast and crew were not remotely going for that.

Carl Weathers is awesome as Chubbs Peterson, Christopher McDonald plays a perfect 'loser' as Shooter and plenty of other good SNL cameos are abundant (Kevin Nealon is great). Adam Sandler is at his funniest with his personality in this movie. The Waterboy and Billy Madison seemed a little more far-fetched, this movie took an idea that seemed like it could happen and threw in a bunch of crazy silliness for added fun and I think it worked like a charm.

I think If someone chose one Sandler movie to see in their life, I would seriously hope this is the one. It's a great golf and hockey movie, but I don't think there is another Adam Sandler movie out there that makes me laugh more, enjoy and laugh some more. ""Happy Gilmore"" is not a bad Adam Sandler film. In the plotline, you have an ultimate hero-type character named Happy and he's fighting to win a life of security for his grandma. Actor Christopher McDonald plays Shooter McGavin, a villain you love to hate and he attempts to foil Happy's quest. There are other actors in this movie, including 'James Bond' actor Richard Kiel, who plays Happy's 8' tall former employer who threatens Shooter at every turn. Bob Barker is also in this movie and he doesn't get much funnier than Mr. Price Is Right insulting our hero. Ben Stiller plays a great part in all this, as he corruptly directs a retirement home.

114,hung_fao_tweeze,Surprisingly pretty okay,7,19 April 2011,"Time and experience has made me loath to watch nearly any movie starring an SNL alumni. Yet every now and then one rises from the comedic swamp that is actually better than the rest of the stable. This is one of them. I avoided seeing this movie until now. After viewing it I was pleasantly surprised. I admit that I didn't expect much so I was quite ready to 'diss' this movie. And, indeed, there are places where you're not sure something was supposed to be funny or not, but the movie doesn't dwell. The pacing keeps it alive and interesting. It's good to see Richard Kiel again. Carl Weathers is a hoot with his wooden prosthetic hand and obviously longer arm. He should do more comedy. And Bob Barker!! A great and memorable inclusion. The only real disappointment was the rather abrupt ending. It didn't go off with a bang - it faded. Abraham Lincoln? Why? Why not. His sudden brief appearance for no reason is always funny. Bottomline: if you find the need to watch a movie from the line of SNL players - this is a good recommendation.

Bob Barker gives one of the best cameos ever as Sandler's p'od parter in a celebrity golf match and Carl ""Apollo Creed"" Weathers returns as an ex-golf champ. Some good laughs, but a predictable story. I think the stardom of Sandler is based on the fact that he acts like somebody you could be buddying around with at a local party -- maybe someone will give me 10 million for a flick like this one day...I think I can take Bob Barker. 7 of 10.",Happy Gilmore

I am glad I saw it as a free movie because other wise I would have demanded my money back. Simply put Adam Sandler plays the same loveable goofball (think Jerry Lewis) with undiscovered talent. This time around Sandler portrays ""Happy Gilmore"" a hockey obessed player who takes up professional golf to earn money to save his grandma's house. The funny moment in this movie for me is after Happy Gilmore exclaims ""The Price is Wrong!!"" to Bob Barker (host of The Price is Right) ,  then Bob Barker gives Happy Gilmore a roundhouse punch to the jaw. Does this mean I wish I could give Mr. Sandler an uppercut, not for this mild mannered person. However I would like to ask Adam Sandler to stop using the same character for his movies.

Adam Sandler plays what he plays best, a guy whom seems like a jerk, but ends up being really sweet.  Sandler plays Happy Gilmore, a low-luck hockey player with no skill, but an incredible slapshot.  His parents are both dead and the person he goes to for advice or comfort is his grandma.  She, however, hasn't paid her taxes in years, and gets her house repossessed by the bank.  Happy stumbles on golfing, and finds that he has an extraordinary talent for driving the ball incredibly far.  To get money, he joins the PGA tour.  His lead rival, Shooter McGavin, buys Happy's grandma's home to make him quit, but they drive a bargain.  If Happy can win the PGA tour, the house is his again.  The results are hilarious.

127,kittiwake-1,Great fun,8,8 November 2006,"I'm an Adam Sandler fan. I'm also a mom. Sometimes, I want those things to be able to mix. This is one movie I was comfortable sharing with my 12-year-old son. (Parents, please watch this one before you let your kids see it if you are conservative!) He gets a kick out of watching Happy overreact to the things that happen to him in this flick. My son also knows not to take Adam Sandler movies seriously. That's one of the great things about him. He can enjoy a movie that isn't considered ""Oscar quality"" and not put it down just for that reason. I found this movie hilarious and watch it often. Some of the cameos were cute. Check out a famous game show host golfing with Happy. The acting was a bit wooden, but game show hosts don't get their job for their acting talent. You'll recognize actors that Sandler casts in all of his movies. (And why not? Ron Howard does it, too!) The plot was cute. If you hate golfing, don't worry. This movie isn't all about golf. That's why it's called ""Happy Gilmore"" instead of ""Golfing with Happy Gilmore"". I think Happy is the ""dark"" side of all of us. Little holds him back from expressing his opinion when things aren't the way he thinks they should be. It's a great ""unwinding"" movie. Had a bad day? Happy does the acting out for you. (If we all acted like Happy, this world would be a strange, violent place. But, since we aren't like Happy, we can live vicariously through him as we watch him do the things we only daydream about.)

129,DaRick89,"Consistently funny, but carried by an over-the-top Adam Sandler",7,1 July 2012,"You don't have great expectations of a movie like Happy Gilmore. You see the cast and you realise that how much you will like the movie depends on how much you like Adam Sandler and his antics. Sandler would become a far more rounded actor later on, but at this time he rarely played anything over than a clownish idiot. Here is no different...but most of the time, it actually works quite well in this movie because Sandler takes that shtick to new and sometimes shocking levels. He does all sorts of wildly over the top and absurdly stupid stuff - whacking people off their balconies with golf balls, throwing tax-men out of houses, fighting with celebrities and coaches, threatening rivals with beer glasses. However, most of it works BECAUSE of its absurdity. Even the other characters sometimes get in on it, with Carl Weathers' character melodramatically falling out of a window at one point. The plot also works as a fairly simple underdog story. Happy Gilmore is a failed hockey player who has to try and get his grandmother's house back after it is repossessed, causing him to take up golf more seriously and face a fancied pro to get it back. However, at a deeper level, the story is all very predictable, replete with the failure, the requisite love interest, the lovable little grandmother, the mentor, the largely humourless golf director and the twisted villain. Nonetheless, the plot does enough to make you get behind Gilmore and laugh as he does absurd things.The acting is often about as predictable as the plot. Indeed, Sandler largely carries this film BECAUSE he is so over-the-top, with deliciously pig-headed lines of dialogue like ""you eat pieces of s*** for breakfast?"". I suspect that if he tried to be a bit more understated, the film would not be as funny so we therefore could not ignore the film's otherwise basic plotting and acting as easily. However, basic acting doesn't necessarily mean BAD acting - everybody else, from Bowen to Bay to McDonald to director Dugan, perform their relatively one-dimensional roles pretty well. Even Ben Stiller and Richard Kiel are a nice surprise as the twisted nursing home warden and Happy's old boss respectively, while the fight scene with Bob Barker is hilarious. The likes of Trevino, Lye and Lundquist provide well-known faces and nothing more. The scenery is quite nice, while I don't take serious issue with the product placement because it makes the tournament a bit more realistic, even if there wasn't any big need for a SUBWAY ad. The music used was also good. Ultimately, the film's basic nature DOES mean that I can't rank Happy Gilmore as being anything more than an above-average comedy despite it being consistently funny. I would also not recommend it for those who dislike Sandler. However, I would recommend it for most other people. 3.5/5 starsP.S: Some of the deleted scenes are as good as the rest of the film.",Happy Gilmore

135,paul_mampilly,"""Till The Night Closes In.........."". Sandler at his best.",7,6 January 2005,"Golf, who would ever thought it would be funny at all. It is very easy to imagine what was going through the minds of Hollywood studio executives when someone said they have got an idea of a comedy which mainly involves golf. It is a narrow genre, however the last time such a movie has been made was Caddyshack. However since I have not seen it, Happy Gilmore is still going to be one of my favorite golf comedy movies.PLOT SPOILERS The plot is really simple. This rubbish wanna be ice hockey player has this phenonomenal talent for whacking a golf ball for more than 500 yards. He decides to take up golf, only for the fact that he needs to get money to pay off his grandmother's debts and get her house back. He sets the golfing world alight and is seen as a new and unconventional hero of the green. His temperament and his amazing drives brings in rowdy crowds, which does bring the game to disrepute but the ratings seems to hitting the roof all the time. Everyone seem to like him apart from the current golf champion, Shooter McGavin, who seems to be jealous from this newcomers popularity. So Shooter decides to get Happy to play him for the championships.This has to be Adam Sandler's best movie that he made. I thought that the Wedding Singer was his best, but that has to be given to this movie. He is so funny as Happy Gilmore, and I would have to say that the greatest scene, is when he starts singing Exile's song. It always cracks me up all the time I see that. The rest of the actors were OK, but to be honest this was Sandler's film. However, I would have to say Ben Stiller's cameo deserves another viewing, as he acted as the sadistic nursing home co worker. Julie Bowen does a moderate job as the love interest, and strangely enough looks like my old biology teacher, which is seriously weird but alluring nonetheless.Anyway I absolutely love this movie, and I have to say that I am a convert to Adam Sandler. However this does not mean that I just only like really stupid movies, but he is a great comic.",Happy Gilmore

138,jaysilentbob37,A film that I treasure.,7,2 July 2006,"This film is the one that introduced me to one of my favorite actors, Adam Sandler. His movies are mostly hit-or-miss gag machines, but this is one of his movies in which nearly every gag works. I almost miss the old Adam Sandler. The old Adam Sandler character would be a man who acts nice, but turns violent and angry when he doesn't get his way. Now he plays a mild-mannered every-man who makes little wisecracks. Not that the latter isn't funny, but the former is what he'll always be remembered for, and this is a perfect example of an Adam Sandler's true comedic side.Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is a nearly unlikeable loser who after a strangely traumatic childhood, grew up to be a raving, anti-social lunatic, who happens to be obsessed with hockey. He constantly tries out for hockey teams, and proudly holds two league records (Most time spent in the penalty box, and he was the only person in history to ever take off his skate and try to stab somebody). One day, his girlfriend dumps him, he doesn't make the hockey team, and the IRS repossesses his grandmothers house which he grew up in. Soon, he discovers that he has an incredible talent for golf, with a record breaking long drive. Unwillingly taken under the wing of one-handed former golf pro Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers), and becomes a golf sensation due to his long drive, and extremely rude behavior, much to the dismay of the leading tour money winner, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). A bitter rivalry and a race-against-time ensue, as Happy tries to earn back his grandma's house, and beat Shooter.Happy Gilmore is a movie that I truly adore, and will always cherish. There are many quotable lines, and hilariously random scenes and/or characters. One of the funniest ones is a cameo by Ben Stiller as a cold-blooded orderly at an old folks home, who treats the citizens like inmates. One of the funniest comic bits in any Adam Sandler movie is the sequence in which Happy gets into a fistfight with Bob Barker, the host of ""The Price is Right."" For some reason, Bob fails to notice the heckler who's most frequently uttered word never fails to affect Happy's game for the worst. Another hilarious thing about this movie is how many of the characters in the movie manage to play their parts and keep a straight face, even when Happy is assaulting innocent people for the smallest reasons, and cussing out the golf ball when it won't go ""home."" Happy is one of a group of quirky characters in the film, but much of the humor comes from the reactions of the serious characters, and/or the extras when Happy does something stupid. One hilarious example of this is when Happy repeatedly screams out every word that can't be said on TV, well... on TV. The overall premise of the film is fun, and the film delivers non-stop laughs. Sit back and enjoy the classic Adam Sandler vehicle. I highly recommend this film, and give it 10/10. It is proudly rated PG-13 for Language and Comic Sexuality.

142,fog-9,lowbrow classic,7,30 January 2006,"happy gilmore lives in a strange place, now inhabited by ben stiller and the cast of American pie... that lowbrow, idiotic type of comedy that requires very little work from the viewer to generate laughs...however, happy gilmore is funny because of a few reasons... movies like this are steam trains; they need to be fed jokes, one liners, visual gags and zany scenes the way a burner needs coal... without them, the movie slows down and slides back down the hill...happy gilmore is relentless in its provision of funny moments... it's a juggernaut, wielding a crazy protagonist and an absurdly unlikeable villain... somewhere, the chemistry was just working...happy gilmore is not intellectually challenging... however, it does not pander exclusively to the bodily fluid and innuendo craving audience... it's hardly very mature, but it's not mindless either... it rather choose to play on the fairways, in the interesting world of pro golf...taking on a subject like golf was a stroke of brilliance, because it is a fertile area for basic humour... it's very nature makes it ideal... instead of drugs or relationships, we are given the gentlemen's game...it's the same old sport movie cliché, but it just seems so fresh... the jarring juxtaposition of the common man in a sport characterised with big money and a sense of elitism... it works brilliantly...adam sandler is excellent at physically conveying uncontrollable, explosive anger... it's hammy in its own way, but few do it as well... he's zany, he has good timing and delivery, and he doesn't let it dip too far into sentimentality... this movie had great pacing, a decent script for a film of its type, and it blows some of his later films out of the water...if you can put yourself in the right frame of mind, few movies of this genre could be as satisfying as happy gilmore... the formula is tired now, but this movie is a cut above...",Happy Gilmore
143,nutz4n64,Best Sandler movie I've seen,9,18 January 2000,"I have only seen two of Adam Sandler's movies, and this is definitely the better.  The acting was terrific on just about everyone's part (are we seeing a big difference from Waterboy hear?).  Anyway, Sandler is a complete loser that tries to become a hockey player.  The movie opens with a Wonder Years type sequence, in which we see Happy's youth years.  Flash forward to a hockey try out in which he kicks the coach's @$$.  I don't know about other people, but I thought that was hilarious.  That and the scenes where the people get hit by his first shots and the kid trying to take a baseball. The actors go about their routines so well that I just can't help but laugh.  Happy's first victory wins him a spot on the pro tour, trying to get enough money to get back his grandmother's house from the IRS.  Along the way, he meets his foe, Shooter McGavin.  The attitude Shooter carries does make him very unlikable and really makes you proud to see his butt get kicked.  Plus, Sandler's hotheadedness sets up many hilarious scenes, including one where Bob Barker kicks the crap out of him and where the censors have to work overtime whenever he misses a shot. We can be proud to know that Sandler makes better movies than The Waterboy.",Happy Gilmore
144,bigdgun,"Boring, stupid, pretentious, not very funny.",1,16 April 2000,"One of the worst comedies of the decade. Not much to laugh at, although I have to admit that it's probably the best Adam Sandler film so far. It is getting really OLD watching Sandler play the same stupid, grown up little child, in all of his movies. You want comedy...see Meatballs, Stripes, Animal House or Caddy Shack...something with a little joie de vivre. This is crap!",Happy Gilmore

He plays uncredited, but steals the show completely!Just mindless fun without any surprises, but good enough if you don't have to do anything better.",Happy Gilmore
146,dover,The best of Sandler's comedies,6,20 May 2000,"While calling a movie Adam Sandler's best may be damning it with faint praise, this is pretty well-done as dumb comedies go. Sandler is in his element as the goofy hockey wannabe trying to raise money by using his 450-yard drives to win money on the PGA Tour. Playing off the indignant Christopher McDonald, a pro on a hot streak bothered by the popularity of this working-class hero, the comedic timing here works out well, and there are some good scenes when tempers flare (a notable one with both McDonald in a bar and TV's Bob Barker).The movie will become a lot funnier if you happen to play golf, or even watch, it, because the antics of Sandler on the golf course (he plays in a Boston Bruins jersey and putts like he's using a hockey stick) are ridiculous enough to be funny. There are some good laughs from various places on the course, and Ben Stiller gets some chuckles as the insane and sadistic orderly at the nursing home Sandler's Grandma is staying in while he tries to win back her house.As a final note, you can't hit a golf ball that far like that. I've tried , my friends have tried, anyone who plays golf and has seen this movie has tried. Everyone just hits a 50-yard worm burner. Standard Sandler fare, but good for a few laughs.",Happy Gilmore
147,helenaduberry,"Silly, moronic and downright funny",7,21 January 2001,"Adam Sandler isn't a popular one with the critics thanks to duds like Airheads and Mixed Nuts. And while I enjoy his recent crop of movies, many do not, which I think is a shame. This has a lot of jokes, and while most are funny, some don't come off with good effect. Happy Gilmore is an amateur hockey player renowned for his violent ways. When he is introduced to golf, he uncovers a talent he never knew he had. The supporting cast is good, with Carl Weathers (Predator) superb as Chubbs the one-handed golfing coach. Yet you feel Sandler has to do a bit more to raise a smile. This is funny but at times a bit too lame for it's own good. 7 out of 10.",Happy Gilmore

Yes you have to like Adam Sandler and you do not need to think much. But it is an hour and a half of pleasure for me and always makes me giggle like a little kid. I love the fact that Shooter is such a numpty and you know he is going down. Carl Weathers as Bubbsy is terrifically over the top and Happy even manages to get his wooden hand destroyed but he gets the alligator he did it. There are also hilarious cameos by Richard Kiel as Happy's ex boss complete with the nail from the nail gun Happy fired at him and causing him to be sacked of course and Ben Stiller as an abusive care home assistant. My favourite scene is Happy's fight with his playing partner at a pro-am tournament who is the guy who presents the Price is Right. ""The Price is Wrong bitch"".

Even Stiller's brief stint as an abusive orderly made me chuckle.All in all, one of my favourites. Re-watch value = infinite.",Happy Gilmore
150,imdb-21622,Laugh out loud funny comedy,9,27 June 2010,"I see a bunch of recent bad reviews. So let's try to understand why people might not like this.1) Adam Sandler annoys them - as we all know, not everyone will appreciate a comedian. Adam Sandler plays a very specific role. He's outrageous. He goes from this little voice, to this manic swearing out of control guy. 2) They don't appreciate dumb comedies - And this is a dumb comedy. It's written that way. 3) They are of the wrong generation - My dad hates many very funny movies. He's of the wrong generation. He thinks Bob Hope is funny. He prefers gentler humor. I hated Super Troopers, but kids love it. 4) They have no sense of humor - I have met these people. They should stay away from comedy movies. Their instinct seems to be to hate comedies until proved worthy of their refined tastes. I feel sad for them.That out of the way, I give this 9/10. Do I like all dumb comedies, no. But this one is special, like Airplane, Caddy Shack, Stripes, etc.First off, Sandler's rants slay me. ""Don't you want to go home! Are you too good for your home??"" His sudden violent impulses are just plain silly. They are meant to so outrageous as to be funny. He has funny lines, and delivers them with perfect timing. He's a born comedian, love or hate him, and this role perfectly suits him. And he's quite likable just like the Hansons' in the movie slap shot. I think because we all want to vent our rage sometimes. It's not like he's mean to people who are nice to him. Or rude. He just has a short temper.Carl Weathers as Chubs is priceless. I think there's real talent in how he delivers his lines. He plays this passionate person who denied his own shot at fame, wants to make Happy great so he can feel part of greatness. His part is played almost totally straight. I almost wish he had more lines in the movie.People have complained that the movie is basically a bunch of gags. What's wrong with that? Almost everyone I know loves Airplane, and it's just a bunch of gags. Almost everyone I know loves Caddy Shack. Even more so, a bunch of gags tied together by almost no plot.Best scenes -Bob Barker vs. Adam Sandler (The Price is WRONG B***!)Adam Sandler asking the ball why it does not just go home (I love to golf, and who doesn't sometimes feel like the ball just does not want to go to it's home)Richard Kiel wearing the T-Shirt, ""Guns don't kill people, I kill people""",Happy Gilmore

I would say That's My Boy is his 2nd best, then 3rd place goes to Billy Madison. Sorry to The Wedding Singer fanboys. Yes that is a funny movie, but it has some sad parts in it. Just like 50 First Dates, The Wedding Singer is more of a romance movie than a comedy.Saying The Wedding Singer is Sandler's best comedy would be like saying Punch Drunk Love is his best comedy. Both are great movies, but they're certainly not Sandler's best comedies.Back in the day, my favorite Sandler movie was The Waterboy... of course I was 15 years old when it came out.... but now that I'm a grown man I cant stand to watch The Waterboy. Yes, that movie has funny parts in it, but it just did not age well at all. I would rather watch Going Overboard than watch the Waterboy. I'm not even joking!Why did I go into so much detail about The Waterboy not aging well?Because my whole point of this review is to say that Happy Gilmore is better with age.

I love Adam Sandler in almost everything he's in. Most people say Adam Sandler was only good in the 90s but I disagree even though I do think his older movies are better than the newer ones. This movie is a classic in its own right but not on the same level as Caddyshack. This movie has great slapstick, funny one liners, pretty good music, and some fine performances but Adam Sandler is the best thing about this movie. I also like the fact that it's one of the only times Adam Sandler shares the screen with Ben Stiller. I look forward to seeing them both in The Meyerowitz Stories. I love this movie!",Happy Gilmore

And I'm telling you this is one of Adam Sandlers greatest movies ever. I rank this movie as his 3rd best ever in my opinion. Big Daddy comes in 2nd and the Water Boy is my favorite Sandler Movie. Many great actors have made their great career starts on SNL. SNL is like the ED Sullivan show for comedians who want to get their starts. And Adam is just another one of those great actors. Will Ferrell is another actor ready to take his acting into the movie world.,Happy Gilmore
157,dustinkdye,Back when Adam Sandler was funny...,6,15 July 2013,"If you only see one Adam Sandler movie in your life, it should be ""Happy Gilmore."" This is the quintessential Adam Sandler movie, the one he has been trying to recreate ever since.Unlike some of the so-called ""smart comedies"" of the past few years, ""Happy Gilmore,"" doesn't pretend to be anything it's not--namely a low- brow comedy. The movie's admittedly banal set-up is simply a platform for the comedy.Happy Gilmore is pretty much the same character Sandler played in Billy Madison: a lovable everyman. Despite his mother walking out on the family after getting fed up with his father's obsession with hockey, and his father dying after getting hit with a puck at a hockey game (all this is in the first couple minutes of the film, so there are no spoilers here), Happy doesn't give up his dream of being a professional hockey player. Happy has an incredibly powerful shot, but he can't skate. After failing another tryout for a pro hockey team, he decides to make some quick cash hustling a golf driving range until next year's tryouts. When his grandmother is in danger of losing her house due to back-taxes, Happy decides to join the golf tour to get the money to save her house. With the help of a retired pro (Carl Weathers, Apollo Creed from ""Rocky""), he quickly becomes the star of the tour, threatening the determined pro, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald, playing the cartoonish villain he plays in every low-brow comedy).Adam Sandler would probably be the first to admit that this is not a great movie. But it is still funny and succeeds in every area it was meant to. Happy's outbursts are often hilarious, especially when he ends up in a fist-fight with Bob Barker. Ben Stiller provides some good laughs as a heinous nursing home attendant, and I especially enjoyed Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond movies) as Happy's former-boss- turned-biggest-fan.Recently coming off ""Saturday Night Live"" and releasing his classic comedy album ""What the Hell Happened to Me?"" only days earlier, ""Happy Gilmore"" is Adam Sandler at his comedic height, which he himself has yet to top.",Happy Gilmore
158,PadraigWalshFilm,It's slapstick at it's finest.,7,19 August 2012,"Happy Gilmore stars Adam Sandler and is probably his most loved and memorable film. The film follows Happy Gilmore, a hockey player who never seems to make the team. When the IRS come and give him a deadline of 90 days to make enough money to save his grandmother's house, he becomes a golf player in order to make the money. Well, it's slapstick at it's finest. And you can tell it's slapstick right from the beginning. And from the beginning I mean the opening credits. It's pure slapstick. But it's funny as hell and I really enjoyed it. It has to be one of the most recognizable films of the 90's. And of the last 20 years. It was Sandler at his best.",Happy Gilmore
159,shaidarharan,"Almost perfect movie, still, painfully funny",10,8 April 2001,"Adam Sandler's best, by far.  This movie is funny from start to finish.  I don't understand why people complain about Chubbs wooden hand, it's obviously fake, thats whats so funny.  If you look in goofs, it says u can see his hand...u can see it the whole time, his frickin prosthetic is about 2 feet longer than it should be (exaggeration maybe).  Adam is having a good time as usual, and he is really funny in this movie, where as in some other ones, just strange.  The only part I didnt like is Bob Barker winning a fight.  I guess that was his stipulation for doing the movie, but he fights like a sissy, not that Sandler looks like he can fight..although he does play a hockey player..sigh..

If Happy Gilmore is real, then he'll be the McEnroe of golf. Happy's dream ambition is to become a hockey, and he screws it. Then he found a secret talent where he can play golf and send the ball flying for 400 yards! An then he met with former ex-golfer named Chubbs (Played by Carl Weathers who plays Apollo Creed in Rocky. Chubbs wants Happy to be a Golfer, and he did.

161,moviemonster92,"Movie Schitzo's Review of ""Happy Gilmore""",7,30 July 2006,"Adam Sandler is a genius. He has made so many great and funny films with basically no plot. I think he enjoys playing dumb characters or characters that learn a lesson at the end of the film. Some of his best performances to date are ""Big Daddy"" and ""50 First Dates"". Here he plays an ill tempered Hockey player who real wants to play the game. When his Grandma (Frances Bay) forgets to pay the mortgage Happy comes to the rescue. He gets help in the form of a black guy who had his hand bitten off by a 'gator. So Happy decides to win some money by playing golf. Along the way he makes an enemy in Shooter McGaven (Christopher McDonald) and catches the eye of a love interest Virginia Vennit (Julie Bowen), all the way headed to win the championship game and to get his Grandma's house back from Shooter. One of the most famous scenes in this movie is the scene where Happy and Bob Barker get into a huge fistfight. This is a very ""Happy"" and dumb comedy from Sandler and his crew that goes up there with some of his other sports movies like The Waterboy and The Longest Yard. All in all this was a very dumb and entertaining movie that should become a favorite of everyones over the years.3 out of 4 stars",Happy Gilmore

163,pvilleguy,Yawn,4,25 April 2006,"Another predictable piece of fluff from Adam Sandler. As long as there are 15 year-old boys, Sandler will have an audience for his movies. Yell a lot, make jokes about bodily functions, toss in a bit of mindless class envy and a ""girl"" (never a strong woman) for Sandler's character to sweep off her feet, and you have the basic formula for everything the guy has been in since he left Saturday Night Live. I'm not blaming him or the people that line up to pay good money to watch this stuff -- he makes lots of cash and the people lining up get mindless entertainment. For the most part his attempts at humor are as harmless as they are limited, and a little mindless fun never hurt anybody.Sandler is a one-trick pony, though, and if he doesn't learn some new tricks pretty soon, he'll become the Jerry Lewis of his generation -- a guy who exhausted his one-trick repertoire early on and spent the rest of his career as a caricature of himself. Jim Carrey seems to understand that phenomenon and while he's no Henry Fonda, he has at least expanded from the ham-handed humor that marked his early films into a few roles of some depth. Maybe Sandler doesn't care to expand --he certainly has no obligation to do anything differently and he's making money hand over fist, so it's a fair question to ask why he would want to change. Makes no difference to me, but it might to him when the notion of what's funny changes (as it will) and he hasn't adapted. Then we can all look forward to the Adam Sandler Labor Day Telethon.",Happy Gilmore

167,pgwhite95,The PGA should be grateful!,7,30 December 2008,"The Professional Golfers Association should define its sport in two era's. That is the time before Happy Gilmore, and the time after Happy Gilmore. Before Happy Gilmore, golf was still the ""guy in plaid pants"" type of sport. A game meant for people of affluence and social position. Happy Gilmore re-kindled the Caddyshack affect, advertising to the young, and not-so-affluent crowd showing us that golf can be both fun, and colorful. The golfing technique that Happy Gilmore uses is funny, and entertaining. His frustration with the game is understandable and is easy to relate for anyone who plays. I know after watching this movie it made me want to golf more, it especially made me want to try out his unique swing and see if I could actually hit a ball like that, which I didn't.Adam Sandler uses his unique, SNL type comedy to drive this movie. The story has a defined plot, with defined characters. This is a remarkable difference to many other, comedies with other SNL actors. Sure, there is some definite points, like where he is pummeling spectators or interacting with other SNL cast members, like Kevin Neeland but, this movie actually delivers both good laughs, and good entertainment. It is a great story which takes some ""kid"" who just wants to play hockey, and ends up being a phenomenal golfer.It has been a few years now since this film was released but, I know plenty of guy's, and ladies who started golfing after watching this movie. It's not so embarrassing anymore to tell your friends you went golfing last weekend, on top of that it's not so embarrassing to go to he golf course wearing a flannel shirt, and shorts.

170,sthapns247,Possibly the Funniest Movie Ever,10,8 February 2004,"Now I'm not one to throw around the ""____est Movie Ever,"" but I'm not afraid to use it here.  I don't judge movies on one large spectrum, like many people; I judge them according to what they are supposed to do.  A war movie should appeal to my emotion on human life; acting is not necessary.  A drama should have good acting and a story that matters and is conveyed well. (Hardest to pull off.)  A comedy is just for entertainment.  The acting can be hit or miss, the story should only exist to make funny stuff happen, and it should get funnier every time you see it.  ""Happy Gilmore"" is like the word ""wiener"" in the sense that no matter how many times I'm exposed to it is still makes me smile, giggle, chuckle, or roll over crying.Adam Sandler has a unique comic style.  It is like a combination of Chris Farley and David Spade, two of the cast members he grew up with on Saturday Night Live.  He can be the straight faced, sarcastic person Spade usually is, but he can also do excellent physical comedy and has an enormous amount of energy much like Farley.  All this comes together in this movie to make the lead character funny just thinking about him.  A hockey player playing golf that glides through life and flips out every once in a while... We've all wanted to be Happy once in our lives. (Whether the name or the adjective applies to you is irrelevant.)The story is there only to make the funny happen.  Gilmore is a failed hockey player and those scenes are awesome.  He then meets an ex-golfer with one hand... Wonder why he's an EX-golfer?  This is played into the whole ""Old, seasoned pro teaches the upstart, reluctant newbie to defeat the bad guy and everyone lives happily ever after.""  But the story is not really important because it's a comedy and it's funny.The dialogue is very good in this movie.  There are so many little things that are said that you have to watch it over and over to catch it all. There are so many one-liners and classic scenes... This is by the number one movie I quote with my friends.Comeos are also important in a comedy movie and this one has the greatest cameo of all time... Bob Barker.  When you see the movie you'll see what I mean.  This also plays into the irony that has to be in a comedy movie, but needs to by styled in a way that you can't see it coming and when it happens you let out a fast, unbelieving laugh and then forget about it... It's how these movies work.All this comes together to make a movie that gets better the more and more you watch it.  The movie exists to amuse and it does this better than any other movie in history.  Some people may say that this movie is not the ""Greatest Comedy Movie"" because it's stupid and senseless... I just look at them and laugh because they don't know what comedy is. (See that was irony.)There is no reason for you not to like this movie unless you look at it the same way you look at ""Forrest Gump"" or ""Saving Private Ryan..."" Don't, its not a drama or a war movie, it's a comedy movie... The best comedy movie ever for that matter.NOTE: Watch the VHS or DVD because it is terribly censored when it is shown on TV and it really detracts from the over all mood of the movie.",Happy Gilmore

I almost got muscle cramps a couple of times because I was laughing so hard! Adam Sandler plays Happy Gilmore, a wanna-be hockey player who can't skate and has no control, but he can kill the puck. His grandmother is about to lose the house his deceased grandfather built for her unless she can come up with a quarter million dollars in overdue income taxes. This leads Happy to his discovery that he is the best long-ball golfer in the world, and with a little coaching (from Carl ""Apollo Creed"" Weathers) he can turn pro. He does and there begins his hilarious journey toward saving Grandma's house.As with his other movies, if you don't like Adam Sandler, then don't rent this. It will drive you insane. If you do like him, however, you'll have a hoot watching this one!",Happy Gilmore
172,walion,Random stuff all the way.,1,10 January 2016,"Writers Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler give us one of the most disappointing comedy movies of 1996. I have no idea how Dennis Dugan has agreed to direct such a story, most of which is just random scenes that are supposed to be funny. Unfortunately most of it is just not in place.Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is a rejected hockey player, who tries to become a MVP in golf so that he can save his grandmother's house, which she's going to lose due to not paying back taxes. He then joins the PGA Golf Tour so he can get the money needed to help his grandma. Henceforth, the movie shows its full ""potential"".Unfortunately, Gilmore has a big rival in the face of the self-assured and envious Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), who will do everything to stop Gilmore from winning the 1st place. Happy's advantage is that he can shoot golf balls for far distances, which ultimately makes him a podium challenger.I don't know whether the things that happened after Happy joined the Tour were written with the intention to be funny or just the writers put some random sounds and stuff not knowing what they were doing. When the golf balls are shot we can hear a sound, as if somebody shoots with a 45mm gun. While the ball is in the air, it seems like it's a Boeing 747 plane with an engine fail.The only moment in the movie that I actually laughed is when Happy, the sociopath playing golf, started hitting the alligator that was not an actual alligator, but a dog, judging on its coherent, typical dog barks. A car (VW Beattle?) runs over Gilmore with about 30-40 km/h and what happens? He's just having pains in the right shoulder, which he moves with not problem at all. After 5-10 shots he again shoots the balls with the same power as he did in the beginning. Adam Sandler is half a Superman in this movie - he even beats a man who can actually be his grandfather by means of age.A very predictable movie. It's only worth watching it just to see the alligator scene. 1/10 for Sandler, 4/10 for the movie.",Happy Gilmore

I am a huge ""Price is Right"" fan and have been to two tapings of the show.  Unfortunately, I was never called on down, but an old geezer I met in line was.  If he'd only have listened to me while playing the Card Game, he would have won a brand new Mercury Tracer. Pity.  I think Bob Barker should make extra money hurting bad actors like Adam Sandler.  (Maybe ""Punch-Drunk Love"" was a fluke:  but there are no absolutes in acting.)  Bob could bash Jennifer Lopez' teeth out with a Plink-O chip or run Joe Pesci down with the Big Wheel.

I'm a fan of hockey -- not one of golf; however knowing that probably made the movie better for me. A golf fan might have found many faults with the movie. Not knowing golf made the movie better for me.Watching (and hearing) the soaring golf balls made me laugh every time. It reminded me of Herman Munster hitting the baseball and beaning Leo Durocher 4 blocks away. The first time I ever saw Herman do that, I was rolling on the floor for several minutes. This movie reminded me of that and I was once again on the floor when Adam Sandler did it with the golf ball. By the way, Herman had me on the floor again when he kicked a football several miles away.I just saw that the movie will be on TV next week (I think TNT or TBS). I truly hope that they do not cut out too much.This was a very pleasant movie and I suggest you watch it with a youngster -- say a 12 year old. They will love it!",Happy Gilmore

177,md-ulus,Stupidity as brilliance,8,22 March 2012,"IMO, Adam Sandler is not a movie star actor, he is a comedian. These days he deludes himself into being a big shot ""actor"", fact is this guy can't act for s**t. He has been relegated to starring in run-of-the-mill comedies that no one remembers or cares about after 6 months.I saw Happy Gilmore when I was 15 or 16 and it was hilarious to my friends and I. After all those years I can still clearly recall every one of my favorite scenes. It's pure ridiculous crap but it was surprising, different, and hilarious to my adolescent male mind.The plot of this movie is nothingness, a weakly contrived excuse to string together a sequence of events comprising a movie. The script is pure idiocy really, but it is an absurdly satirical idiocy, and absurdity can be really hilarious if it's done right.Really, it's like a stand up comedy routine presented as a narrative, it's all about Adam Sandler getting laughs as a true comedian, not a wannabe actor.",Happy Gilmore

This film has a great cast who all play off each other brilliantly, especially Chris McDonald & the guy from Rocky & I can't believe it didn't do better in the cinema in England... in fact it might have only been on selected releae here 'cause I can't remember it coming out.  Sandler is great in it & all you people that say he mumbles his lines, it's his style & it's that which attracts the audience to him because he seems so non threatening to the audience. This is a beautiful film & it demonstrates the ability of all the actors brilliantly... Adam Sandlers temper, Chris McDonalds snyde nature, the loveable grandma's loveableness. It seems kinda the actors as charicatures, but instead it's just good casting.  This film is awesome... I think i've seen it about 80 times & i still haven't got tired of it.",Happy Gilmore

Adam Sandler plays a man called Happy Gilmore and he tries to be a hockey player but sucks and he sucks at hockey and almost kills people at it. Then one a man call chubs teaches him how to golf and he becomes the best golfer of all time. There is also a idiot named shooter and he competes against happy and happy ends up beaten shooter. The ending of the movie is the best part because after happy beats shooter steals his jacket and then everybody beats up shooter.

187,RevolverConnery,Classic Comedy,8,10 December 2008,Not since Caddyshack (the first not the second) has golf been painted in such a humorous light. It is a story that many of us can identify with. A man has a dream but happenstance causes him to change direction when tragedy strikes his family. In this case a hockey player's grandmother loses her house and he discovers a talent for golf. With help from a living golf legend this scrappy up and comer prepares to join the pro circuit finding love and a rival along the way.There are so many classic bits and lines that you'll not regret seeing this film. I know people who don't like Sandler's work and still never miss an opportunity to see Happy Gilmore. There are even some meta-humorous elements. Such as when the character Chubbs says that his mother didn't allow him to play football. When in real life the actor actually played for the Oakland Raiders in the 1970's.Watch this with friends. Definitely not a kids movie but it is a real blast. You are going to want this one for your own movie collection 8.5 of 10,Happy Gilmore

In fact, I don't like most of his films, but this one is genuinely funny.Carl Weathers is great as the one-handed golf pro and Ben Stiller and Bob Barker (of all people) have great cameos. Christopher MacDonald, who is a fine actor, is very good as Happy's nemesis, Shooter McGavin.

""Happy Gilmore"" is just a ""Laugh Out Loud "" comedy, if I can steal such a cliché' phrase.(Which I use so often) The reason I say that is....some movies make you chuckle, smile, etc....but when you actually ""Laugh Out Loud"" ,that's a funny comedy. I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie and the intro where Happy is doing the voice over giving you the back story on his life. I was in tears laughing so hard. (Theatrical/DVD/VHS version)(TV edit was cut bad.) If you haven't seen it, shame on you. This just became available in a deluxe 2 disc set with ""Billy Madison"".(A good comedy but not as good as ""Happy"") Check it out. God, I hate that Bob Barker!!!!",Happy Gilmore

193,iollann,Review 'Happy Gilmore',6,28 March 2017,"Review: 'Happy Gilmore' 'Happy Gilmore' starring Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen and Christopher McDonald is a film about a rejected hockey player who tries his hand at golf to save his grandmother's house from being repossessed. Directed by Dennis Dugan, released in 1996 this is an Adam Sandler classic and definitely one of his best films but that's not saying much. 'Happy Gilmore' is an aspiring hockey player but he is always been rejected. When he learns that his Granny's house is going to be seized he joins a local golf tournament under the management of 'Chubbs Peterson' played by Carl Weathers. He wins the tournament and earns his place on the pro golf tournament. As I said Adam Sandler puts in his usual crude, juvenile performance but this time it actually works especially in comparison to his other recent films like 'Jack and Jill' and 'Grown Ups'. This film was released when Adam Sandler was putting out his best films like 'The Water boy' and 'Billy Madison'. Adam Sandler has plenty of experience playing characters like 'Happy' because in all of his films that I have seen he plays the same character. Christopher McDonald puts in a fairly decent performance of Happys' rival and reigning champion of the pro golf tournament 'Shooter McGavin' an arrogant and pretentious man. As I said he plays him pretty well. Bill withers puts in quite a funny performance as 'Chubbs' Happys' mentor and eventually friend. In comparison to his performance in 'Rocky' as 'Apollo Creed' he plays a much more comedic role showing his versatility. My favourite scene in 'Happy Gilmore' is when 'Happy' has a fight with Bob Barker from 'The Price is Right' who is playing himself. This is a pretty iconic scene in my opinion as most people I know, even if they haven't seen the film will know of this scene. I think that is what id best about this film, the back and forth between characters, Happy and Bob Barker, Happy and Shooter McGavin and Sometimes even happy and Chubbs. Another great scene that really sticks out to me is Happys' dream sequence. It's really uniquely shot and funny at the same time. All in all I criticize Adam Sandler's performance but this is truly his best film. I first watched this film when I was very young so I am quite nostalgic about it. I would like to see Adam Sandler try his hand at serious acting or going back to his roots to films like 'The Water Boy' or 'Happy Gilmore' because films like 'Jack and Jill' aren't working. Adam Sandler has proved he actually can be quite funny with the right actors around him supporting him. I give it a 6/10 it probably should be a 5/10 but I feel very nostalgic about it.",Happy Gilmore
194,smiley pie,A Golfer's Nightmare!!!!!,10,26 April 2000,"I had never heard of this film before but I saw it had Adam Sandler in and it was a comedy and thought it has to be quite funny!!  Well I was WRONG!!!! It was 100 times better.Happy Gillmore is a fanatical Hockey freak and will do anything to make the team but when he fails to make the Hockey team again he decides to beat up the hockey coach!!When his grandma's house gets taken by the IRS (because she has not paid her taxes) Happy promises her he will get the $217,000 to get the house back at first he has no idea what he is going to do. 
But when he discovers that he has an abosolutely amazing drive in golf he decides to enter the pro tour but he was not the best behaved person on the tour because he would swear in front of a live audience and even beat people up.If you liked Adam Sandler in BIG DADDY and THE WEDING SINGER you will love this it is a must see film (not just for golf lovers)9/10",Happy Gilmore

196,liell,I'd say this is probably the funniest movie of all time.,9,19 July 2011,"As far as comedy goes, this is the best! It honestly does not get better than Happy Gilmore. I don't think I've ever laughed as hard in a movie! Even after seeing it at least five times, it stay makes me laugh out loud! A word of advice: This is a movie to watch with a group of people who also like to laugh. It will be a lot more enjoyable the more you laugh and the more you know other people think it's funny too. That being said, it's not the type of movie you'd want to watch if you're looking for some deep message. It's just a simple story about a new golfer with anger management issues who tries to win back his grandmother's house. But it is HILARIOUS.To demonstrate the type of humor used throughout the film, imagine a quiet, peaceful golf course filled with proper people there to enjoy the sport. And then there's Happy. He comes to the course dressed like a bum, has no idea what he's doing, and treats the game as if no one were watching. For example, he frequently gets mad when the ball does not go in the hole. Once, in my favorite scene, he gets down on the ground next to the ball and says, ""SON OF A B**** BALL, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST GO TO YOUR HOME?! THAT'S YOUR HOME! ARE YOU TOO GOOD FOR YOUR HOME?! ANSWER ME!"" and then begins freaking out even more.So, I guess, if you don't like that kind of humor, this movie's not for you. But if you think that it'd be funny to watch a psycho golf player on the course and dig an inspiring story of love and determination on the side, check this out. It's become a classic in my mind, and out of all the great comedies I've seen, none of them seem to compare with this one.Adam Sandler, you are a genius.With love, Simba Jackson",Happy Gilmore

Adam Sandler is without a doubt a very funny guy. this movie combines hockey and golf. Sandler playing Happy Gilmore is a hockey player but he's playing golf today. trying to save his grandmothers house he is forced to come up with some cash and quick. Shooter McGavin sees Happy as a threat and will do anything get him out of his way of winning a tour title. this movie has everything you're looking for in a movie, Sports, comedy, and a little bit of romance. if you've had a bad week and are looking for an escape from reality this is definitely a good movie to get the job done.",Happy Gilmore

I have yet to show this movie to any friends or family and find one who didn't like it.

I know a lot of people think his comedy is strange, or too dry, but I get it. The same goes for any comedian. It's in the small nuances of Mr. Sandler's delivery, and his facial reactions that crack me up. The way he can deliver a put-down, or insult is priceless. He's always at his best when he's playing himself, instead of a forced scripted character, and also when he has the same crazy friends in his movies. This is one of the rare movies, like ""Star Wars"" that I can watch over and over again. Great job!",Happy Gilmore

It has the funny moments, the fun characters, the memorable music, moments, and quotes, and also being one of the most famous sports flicks and Adam Sandler flicks of all time! But it does have problems. It is clichéd, but this was the 90's. Clichéd sports flicks were common then. It has stupid moments like the ass shot at one point and how could Happy get that crazy shot to work TWICE? A few jokes don't work and apparently on the DVD version, we don't see Hank the Quilt guy get his proper punishment. But apparently you can see it on TV, so OK, I guess? But despite that, it's a comedy classic and definitely, next to Caddyshack, one of the best golf films of all time. Happy is funny, Chubbs is another one of the great mentors, Virginia's good, I love the grandma, the Bob Barker cameo was awesome, the ""Jackass"" guy was funny, and so and so on. I also even love Mr. Larson, too. I mean, it's not perfect, but it's fun, funny, exciting, memorable, and one Adam Sandler's best, if not THE BEST, film/s EVER! THE END",Happy Gilmore

With its cast of highly unemotional actors and a cringe-worthy 'happy place' containing a midget on a bicycle, that I think is meant to crack some laughs, Happy Gilmore has a rather bizarre feel to it. The 'bad guy' is just ridiculously bad and the good guy is all too naive and innocent. Not to mention 'Happy's reaction to the death of a good friend is acted as if he had merely scratched his thumb. But a movie that deserves its own category 'the Adam Sandler' it is rounded and i believe that all movies deserve to be watched, so watch this movie with a very open mind. Enjoy.",Happy Gilmore

As a golfer myself I can say that the antics pulled in this golf caper are are riot!  I have seen the film probably over 50 times but each time I laugh as if it were my first time viewing it.From Carl Weathers and his wooden hand, to Happy  teaming up with Bob Barker, this movie keep you laughing the whole way through.  Even my 80 year old grandparent loved it!Perhaps the best review I can give for this movie comes from Happy himself-- ""Talk about a hole in one!""",Happy Gilmore
220,mikejohnston,The funniest film EVER,10,9 November 2001,"Adam Sandler comedy is very much an acquired taste, however if you like films such as Road Trip, Deuce Bigalo (by Sandlers Production Company Happy Maddison) or Tom Green or Jackass humour I would highly recommend his films. Also if you have liked any of Sandler's other films then Happy Gilmore is a must see. Although not as mainstream as Big Daddy or The Wedding Singer, Happy Gilmore is the funniest of his films to date. There are so many good lines in this film that it continues to be amusing watch after watch and for the first few viewing had me almost in tears at some points. I have now seen this film too many times to even count and could probably recite the whole script along to the film, however it is still funny every time I see it. Truly the funniest film I have ever seen. 10 out of 10.(N.B. if you liked this film then be sure to see Billy Maddison as well)",Happy Gilmore

You don't have to behave, as long as you can make jokes. You don't have to be polite, as long as your girlfriend is not around. I wonder what kind of message this movie is trying to make. Only because you have a good goal(buying back grandma's house) and then complete it shouldn't make you a hero. This movie is directly targeting at the teenagers and yet they used an extreme way to suit the teens' appetite, that's sad. That's why there are so many divorces nowaways. Because your boyfriend doesn't have to be a good guy as long as he's good to you, at least that's what you think before the marriage. Then when the 2 people finally get together Happy Gilmore is going to punch Virginia in the face just like how he punched other golf players, because Virginia burnt the steak.",Happy Gilmore

227,Travis_Bateman,"As a non-Sandler fan, I liked this one!",7,19 July 2004,"I'm certainly not a big Sandler fan, as all his comedies seem too alike...except this one. Happy Gilmore. Basic story. Happy's grandmother is booted from her home, which Happy's grandfather built by hand or something. Happy stumbles upon a great golf swing of his, no doubt due to the fact that he is also a hockey player. So Happy works his way up the circuit and makes money, friends, and enemies along the way in his mission to get the house back, and you can imagine the square peg in a round hole scenario you get from having a hockey player in the golf world. Now unlike the typical Sandler comedy, the supporting cast is just too good to make this typical. Christopher McDonald is hilarious as the arrogant veteran golfer, Shooter McGavin, as he steals nearly every scene he's in. Carl Weathers is good as Chubbs Peterson, the golf pro with a wooden hand anxious to train Happy. Also look for Bob Barker's cameo, Ben Stiller's sleazy character, and even Richard Kiel - who played Jaws in the James Bond movies.Surprisingly there's never really an unentertaining moment and all the jokes and gags seem to hit more often than miss. Check this out, even if you don't care for Sandler's other movies, you may like it. I give this a 7 or 8.",Happy Gilmore

But one man changes all that. Meet Adam Sandler, an unlikely golf player with anger to boot. But if he used that anger properly, could he go very well? Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) has to raise a lot of money to save his Grandmother's house. He tries everything until one day he is tempted to hit a ball for $20. Guess what? He proves to be better than his friends. Despite what he thinks, he is better at golf than hockey but still he continues to believe that he is a pro at hockey. Then one day he meets a man who he really hates and he wants to open a can of whoop ass all over him.This movie gets more into violence than some people might have wanted but still it remains entertaining.If you want a good soundtrack, this movie rocks the house with songs by such artists as Pilot and many more. The soundtrack is truly, ""Magic."" Some people might just dance to the soundtrack and forget about the movie. Not me, though, I love both. The music for this movie suits the mood of the film and the golfing way.The lighting for this movie is good compared to the movie,""Dead poets society."" Most of the movie is in the day were Sandler is at his most active. The choreographing of this movie is great when it follows the balls long journey to the hole.I'd have to give this movie a 7/10 because I hate golf but I love this movie. If anybody wants to watch golf hanging by the edge of your seat, watch this movie. If your too lazy to sit at the edge of your seat or you don't like the pain, you can still enjoy this movie from a far.",Happy Gilmore
229,Bassthang,One of his best.,10,9 April 2008,"Adam Sandler is rapidly becoming my favourite on-screen comedian. He has this knack of doing incredibly stupid films that nevertheless manage to put a big stupid grin on my face for the whole show. This one has all the Sandler trademarks: a daft plot, a pervading sense of (mostly) innocent fun, incredibly funny supporting cast, plenty of cameos, cartoon-like laws of physics, references to his other films (or is that vice-versa in this case?). His characters tend to start out unlikeable (such as Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison), but the viewer ends up rooting for them anyway as the film progresses and the character's good side is revealed. There is usually a positive, inclusive feeling to the comedy style: just about all the characters in the film (even the sleaze-bags) are treated well by Sandler's character (once he gets over his temper tantrums in this case), which puts these films head and shoulders above the derisive, divisive style of humour that seems so common elsewhere these days. Sandler's characters tend to only make headway when they are being good, which isn't a bad message for the kids in the audience. Yet there's nothing saccharine or Disney-esquire here. While some gags are a bit predictable, there are still plenty of surprises and some outright lunacy that keep it fresh. Even once you suds out what the Sandler formula is, the films are still enjoyable to watch. Sheer fun!",Happy Gilmore

It's a great movie to watch with friends for the first time, especially for the fact that you will be quoting lines with them randomly for quite a while. I have seen it over 30 times, and I still laugh. This is Adam Sandler at his very best. Great random characters, such as the ""Jackass"" man, the homeless guy, and very best, Bob Barker!

A kid gets hit with a baseball machine, and air conditioner drops on an old lady. There isn't much of anything I didn't like about the movie.

Basically, it is an absolute classic, for the average viewer unfamiliar with the Sandler-esquire subtle timings and completely random-style comments throughout, the film may be wasted. But the movie does not disappoint. Adam Sandler does what he does best, presumably playing a character close to his own personality once again as a sportin' nutter. The sub-characters are just as hilarious, and the film is a well produced, while still being a non-stop selection of whacky moments and endless quotable lines...Ben Stillers semi-cameo role as nursing home attendant is genius, as he uses the old folk as cheap labour for hustlin' textiles in their sewing time, and is a proper Bastard to them all...'you can trouble me for a warm glass of SHUT THE HELL UP!'

Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and especially The Waterboy were simply humiliating, low-budget comedies with no humor save the odd inappropriate pun or a flat-out dumb joke. Now, however, he seems to be making more... sophisticated movies, which will help his career far more than his previous works. Happy Gilmore is somewhat predictable, but despite that fact, after watching it I was still grinning because of the random midget-on-a-tricycle daydream.

252,Matt&RLP,A comedy classic.,9,20 July 1999,"Happy Gilmore is truly one of the funniest movies of all-time. It stars Adam Sandler as a frustrated, would-be hockey player turned PGA golfer -- by far his best film performance. Carl Weathers (Chubbs Peterson), Christopher MacDonald (Shooter McGavin),  Ben Stiller (nursing home aid), Bob Barker (himself), and Lee Trevino (himself) also all turn in memorable and hilarious acting jobs. The Pepsi Pro-Am fight scene between Gilmore and Barker is (in my opinion) the funniest scene in movie history. For those of you who may not have seen the movie, first of all, do whatever you can to see it as soon as you possibly can, but secondly, I don't want to say anything more for the chance of ruining part of the movie for you.

263,peachiepagan,Adam's best performance yet!!!!!,9,20 March 2007,"Happy's golfing talents are discovered in this action-packed sports comedy movie that drove into the box-office this week. Ice Hockey ""wonnabe"" Happy Gilmore introduces his 400 yard golfing talent and begins to change the way of golf as the IRS re-processes his grandmothers home due to not paying taxes. Happy( Adam Sandler) has a well under par golf performance, but a spectacular acting one as he hits the spot every time.As a rejected Ice Hockey player, Happy discovers his golfing talents and ex-pro Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers) helps him progress. Gilmore with his popular 400 yard drives is aiming for the hole-in-1's to raise the money required to get his grandmothers house back. Happy's talent and rage creates the media interest that he needs to join the Pro tour. Competing with bitter rival Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) on the tour, they have their ups and downs to say the least and the practical jokes keeping coming.Comical moments are throughout this box-office spectacular such as the soaking of Gilmore on the green at 9pm where he expects to meet the other pros' and his rival Shooter is to blame. Gilmore's anger and rage threatens his place on the tour which Shooter encourages his being thrown off. But due to the public interest and viewing figures Gilmore brings he remains on the tour although the outburst the fight with Bob Barker isn't the best moment for Gilmore.Gilmore's anger is a key part to this comical film as several times throughout the film he lets himself go as he relieves his anger. Such as at the mini golf course he decides that the clown that keeps laughing at him when he misses a put would be better without a big red nose. Or the fight on the Pro AM with Bob Barker after they come last and Bob isn't pleased or the pushing of Happy's caddy but none the wiser Happy believes it's just someone pinching his clubs.Adam Sandler has yet another comical film but this has to be rated as his best performance yet in a positive acting career. This film is a sports comedy which is a must-see although the rating of 12 is appropriate as there are some sexual comical references. Gilmore has made this a must-see and the film is well worth a top spot at the box office as Gilmore bring a whole new life on golf.",Happy Gilmore
264,toomstone06,Happy Gilmore,10,3 August 2009,This movie is hysterical. You'll like it if you are an Adam Sandler fan. This movie is not recommended for people that do not enjoy Sandler flicks. It's a typical Adam Sandler film of him being a goofball. His character though is slitely different than his character Billy Madison. The characters are both goofballs but Happy Gilmore is more tough. For my full review of the movie go to my movie review website at this link moviemaniaonline.webs.com/. I don't wanna write the review here just in case I accidentally put a spoiler. But like I said Happy Gilmore is hilarious. If you like hockey or golf you'll probably enjoy this film.

I don't think it would be possible to write a role he is more suited to, humorous, angry ( in a comical way ), and slightly deranged!Persuading Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed in Rocky, bad guy in Predator) to star in this film was a master stroke. As Chubbs, the former golf pro who lost his hand playing golf he is the perfect foil for Happy (Sandler). All the cast obviously enjoyed making this film immensely.It may be about golf, but don't let that dissuade you, it's not boring!! And you don't need to know anything about golf to enjoy the film.I have to also mention Happy's Nemesis Shooter McGavin - the smooth-talking wisecracking rival golfer.  He is superb, playing his role with real aplomb - why haven't I seen him before?!I don't want to give anything away, as I wouldn't want to take any of your enjoyment away, but GO WATCH THIS FILM!  It may be slapstick to a degree but it works!  I have seen it about 50 times or so but it still cracks me up every time.

Making use of his trademark humor, Adam tells the story of Happy a failed hockey player who can't skate. Upon finding a set of his grandfather's golf clubs Happy learns he can drive the ball better than the pros. This plot sets Adam up for a great story riddled with jokes. The jokes themselves are hilarious, I mean how funny is it to watch Happy get drilled in the face with baseballs as he ""trains"" for next season.

Once Happy joins the PGA, things get funny fast as he brings silliness and antics to the golf course much to the ire of the other professional golfers. Of course, Happy learns some life lessons along the way, and teaches others a few, keeping the story light through the Happily Ever After ending.Acting was pretty good with Sandler delivering his usual. McDonald was also in character as Happy's nemesis and did nicely. Bowen played nicely with everyone else and Bay was amusing as always. The remainder of the supporting cast was solid and entertaining.Camera work, sets, and backgrounds were good and consistent with a high budgeted film. Physical effects were of the slapstick variety, as is normal for a Sandler flick, and good. Dialogue was campy and silly yet kept the movie entertaining. Sound and soundtrack were both well done.Overall Happy Gilmore is an entertaining comedy that moves long nicely with plenty of laughs. Those wanting intellectual stimulation will be a bit disappointed while those just wanting some good laughs will likely enjoy the film quite a bit.",Happy Gilmore
270,reviewer77,The greatest sports comedy... ever!,9,5 November 2005,"Watching Happy Gilmore for the first time after a year or two, I was struck by just how funny the whole film is. For some strange, strange reason, this film was given horrible reviews by most 'big' critics. It scores only 58% approval on RottenTomatoes.com, and an even less impressive 31% on MetaCritic.com. I think I can see why  it is exactly the sort of film people can point out all the weaknesses in and feel superior too. This is a shame, because Happy Gilmore belongs on any list of the greatest sports comedies of all time.Adam Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, an unsuccessful hockey player whose grandmother has not paid her taxes in years. When the IRS takes over her house, Happy has no choice but to put his grandmother in a nursing home for the time being. In one of his most underrated roles, Ben Stiller plays the supervisor at the nursing home. This is a man who is almost comically evil. When an old lady complains her fingers hurt, he replies, ""Aww, well, now your back's gonna hurt, because you just pulled landscaping duty!"" While at the driving range, Happy discovers he has a strange talent  he can drive a golf ball 400 yards. Realizing that winning the PGA tour could allow him to buy his grandmother's house back, he teams up with retired golfer Chubbs (Carl Weathers) and becomes a golfer. Julie Bowen stars as Virginia Venit, Happy's love interest. And, in an absolutely brilliant performance, Christopher McDonald plays Shooter McGavin, one of the most memorable comedic villains ever.The film is constantly funny, charming, and well paced at an hour and a half. You can watch this film over and over again, and it will not get old. This is Adam Sandler's best comedy.",Happy Gilmore
271,mike-macblane6,The Best hockey/ golf movie ever!!,8,4 July 2013,"When it comes to hockey and golf, there's a known correlation that brings the two sports together. The second I hear the name Happy Gilmore (Adam Sander), I immediately think of the hockey player turned professional golfer Happy Gilmore. The screenplay in each scene describes every part extremely. The dialog is hilarious you'll be remembering these quotes for days. Every time I see him in his movie I think why I can't ""hit a golf ball 400 feet."" That's something I could never do. Happy Gilmore finds away to hit the golf ball that far.The reason I say that is because Happy Gilmore finds out that his grandmother's house is being repossessed and finds a new hobby, golf. Happy's grandma hasn't paid her taxes in over fifty years so the government has the right to take all of her possessions. While at local golf course Chubs Peterson, an old golf pro, somehow finds Happy just to drag him into the world of golf. A classic quote that Happy says during when Chubs first meets happy while he's in a batting cage, ""Three hundred and sixty-four more days until next year's hockey tryouts, gotta toughen up!"" Then Chubs says, ""By god son, you're making me sick!"" One of the best quote's in the entire movie. He wanted this for his grandma. His grandma meant the world to him. He thought that each tournament he was in would give him money to put towards buying the house. Happy won the invitational tournament, but a lot of it was just on pure luck. He'll have to rely on luck through the entire pro tour.Throughout this, Happy Gilmore learns that as he enters into this pro tour that he's going to be introduced to his new reason to play golf. That was to beat his new rival Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Shooter McGavin was the leader in tournaments won and money earnings. People began to notice that Happy Gilmore is a character of his own. Tournaments began to be sold out every time and he started attracting people that you normal wouldn't see at a professional golfer's tour. They just want to see Happy Gilmore perform and do well along with his bizarre behavior. A long time former employer, Mr. Larson appears in one of the tournaments. He's there to cheer for Happy not Shooter. Throughout the rest of the tour Shooter is tormented by him. A quote that'll keep coming back to was what Mr. Larson says at two tournaments of which he was at and he takes Shooter McGavin's nine iron and bends it saying, ""Shooter haven't you forgotten your nine iron???? HAHAHAHA!"" At tour championship Mr. Larson shows up again but when appears there, Shooter McGavin hits the ball into the crowd. The ball all of a sudden lands on Mr. Larson's foot, he shouts, ""Is this your ball?! It struck my foot!"" Shooter asks the tour director if he can get a drop, but the tour director says that he has to play it as it lies. So Shooter hits the ball of Mr. Larson's foot, Mr. Larson says after that, ""That's too thus far Shooter!"" Shooter answers back, ""Oh you count?"" Then Mr. Larson fires back, ""And you can count on me waiting for you in the parking lot!"" The crowd goes, ""OOOOOOOOOO! Better run Shooter!"" Best part of the movie by far! Shooter McGavin decides he needs to get even with Happy Gilmore by hiring the Jackass Man to get Happy Gilmore off the tour when Happy is playing with famous television game show host, Bob Barker. Happy just needs to develop his short game to be able to beat Shooter McGavin. He realizes that he needs Chubs, so he goes back to him to work on his short game and pleads that he knows everything. The one thing he points out is he needs to find his own ""Happy place"". His grandma is included with what he's thinking about in his happy place because she makes her grandson very happy. There's one more tournament and that's the Tour Championship, but I can't let any details about how this ends. I'll let you find out for yourself.This movie really is a movie for the ages. You'll be remembering this movie probably the rest of your life. Adam Sandler really is a character to watch for in this movie alone. The rival between Happy Gilmore and Shooter McGavin is almost an unforgettable rivalry that will be ever to be shown in a movie. I can promise you this movie will not disappoint. It's a movie to die for. If you hockey or golf then this movie would be a perfect fit for you. I hope you enjoy!",Happy Gilmore
272,dinofiasco,A comedy for those who laugh at kick-in-the-crotch jokes,2,29 August 2013,"Many have consider this one of the funniest movie of all-time. Seriously? I did not laugh once during this film. All the intended funny scene involved someone getting hit with an item (golf balls, ac unit, nail-gun, golf club) Happy beating up someone/something, characters cursing/threatening someone, and Adam Sandler's character pretending objects were his penis.This is not a movie for those that enjoy high-brow comedy. If you enjoy America's Funniest Home Videos, this a movie for you. Otherwise, skip this low-brow, slapstick-filled, lame attempt at humor.AT least this movie didn't resort to the lowest form of humor: fart jokes.",Happy Gilmore
273,aprilkey22,Wowsers!!!,10,5 April 2019,"Omg where do I begin with this masterpiece of classic comedy? Well, for starters, this film has it all - funny moments, touching parts and, of course, golf. Adam Sandler gives an award winning performance as Happy Gilmore, a hockey player kicked out of the local league for being a rude person. To fill up his time, he takes up golf. Genius. I know! It's a goooood film and deserves to be more praised for its comedic timing and sports.",Happy Gilmore
274,weekealex,A Hockey player wannabe who becomes a golfer,8,27 September 2013,"In the movie ""Happy Gilmore"" (1996), Adam Sandler is the main character. The film director is Dennis Dugan. In this film, Happy Gilmore has no direction in life; he is a failed hockey player. His dream was to become a professional hockey player but he cannot skate; he then becomes one of the best golfers in the town. Happy's grandmother, who he was raised by, soon finds out that she is going to lose her house. So, after realizing that he has these amazing golf skills, Gilmore joins the P.G.A. tour to try to win money to save his grandmother's house from getting bought by someone else. He finds out about his spectacular golf drive while he is at the driving range one day. He becomes the star of the crowd and everyone loves Happy. His rivalry is named Shooter McGavin who thinks Happy Gilmore is a joke and an embarrassment.In this film, I think the primary message would be that Adam Sandler is a failed hockey player but soon finds his passion in golfing and helping out his grandmother. Although Sandler's dream in ""Happy Gilmore"" was to become a famous golfer, he realizes that golfing is his true strength. Even though you might want to be one thing in life, sometimes it does not always work out and you end up finding something much better. Adam Sandler happened to do just that. I also think that the director really wanted viewers of the film to see how much Happy Gilmore loved and cared for his grandmother. Overall, I thought the whole film was enjoyable. Adam Sandler is my favorite actor which is one of the reasons why I chose to write about this movie. I love Happy Gilmore's sense of humor in the film. He was always goofing around on the golf course. I also liked how much he cared for and loved his grandmother. Family is important to me and I enjoyed watching Adam Sandler love his family in the movie.",Happy Gilmore

276,trotterjt,"Happy Gilmore, produced by Subway and starring the same guy Sandler always plays",1,7 May 2010,"I'll admit, when I was 14 I enjoyed this movie. Watching it as an adult, I can understand perfectly why Gene Siskel walked out of the theater during this movie, the second walkout of his entire career. Sandler plays Happy Gilmore as the same character Sandler has ever played: a mercurial, boyish, sweet-talking violent sociopath. Some of the setups are mildly amusing (the fight with Bob Barker) but most off-putting to me, besides the violent rages Happy flies into every 30 seconds, is the blatant product placement. ""Happy Gilmore"" genuinely feels like an infomercial for Subway. I wonder if they funded the whole movie.",Happy Gilmore

Unfortunately, the comedies that are advertised the most and make the most money are stupid ones like this, with talentless ""actors"" like Adam Sandler being the same person in every single film. Don't get me wrong - I hated him the FIRST time he did his character. On Saturday Night Live, he and David Spade were the two worst, yet ""Canteen Boy"" was a huge hit. Ugh.If you want smart humor, you don't see an Adam Sandler film EVER. If you want easy-to-understand humor, go see Naked Gun or something instead - it's very easy to understand, but one thousand times better. This type of movie is for people that don't know any better, it really is. Saying that it's a movie you ""treasure"" makes me sick.Adam Sandler is, and always will be, totally talentless and unfunny. He has been his whole life, yet the entirely slow public loves him. I'll never understand. If you have any respect for your intelligence, never watch this movie or any other movie featuring this awful human being.",Happy Gilmore

When by chance Happy discovers he possesses an abnormally long drive with a golf club and joins a golf tournament, hilarity ensues. Adam Sandler plays the part of Gilmore to perfection, and his emotional reactions to events in the film are unquestionably funny. From Happy pushing over his caddy to his brutal assault on a miniature golf clown, you will thoroughly enjoy the ride.While this movie has its faults, it's one of the only comedies that made me laugh out loud during its entirety, and I still laugh at it after seeing it dozens of times.",Happy Gilmore
279,colevasic,The Typical Comedy,6,11 December 2015,"We all know what a comedy is and we can all predict the plot of the movie before even finishing it, wouldn't it be nice if we had a comedy where we didn't know what was going to happen? Or if the movie surprised us at the end? Happy Gilmore isn't an exception. Happy Gilmore is about this guy who is kind of struggling with living and his grandma gets kicked out of her house which really upsets him. During the process of moving his grandma out he comes to find that he is really good at golf, but not in the normal way he isn't necessarily, ""professional"" he just runs and hits the ball and it just soars through the air. This guys name is Happy Gilmore, Happy ends up going to the big tournament where he must face off with the best golfers in the world, here he faces many challenges and has to learn to be a better golfer to win the tournament and use that money to buy back his mothers home. This movie is just like any other cliché movie that the main person overcomes the challenge, or the hero wins the war, etc. The biggest struggle Happy has to overcome in this film is his biggest competition, a guy named Shooter McGavin who is a real professional golfer who has been doing it a whole lot longer than Gilmore. Happy Gilmore isn't completely taken by surprise with golf because he has been playing hockey is whole life which basically involves the same swing technique and everything that golfing does. But Happy realizes that he won't ever have the chance to win the tournament unless he seeks help from someone who knows what exactly they are doing. The person that Gilmore goes to and seeks out is a guy he knows as Chubbs, who has a fake arm because it got bitten off during a golf tournament by an alligator. This movie is definitely one of those, ""dirty secret comedies"" where the humor is just kind of dumb comedy but that doesn't mean it isn't funny, it definitely is a funny movie! This movie is attracted for its simplistic representation and I would concur, because you already know what basically is going to happen before the movie even ends. The main part of this movie is that Happy has to beat Shooter McGavin in a tournament in order to pay for his Grandmas house so she doesn't have to move out. Whenever there is a plot like this in a movie, you know that the main character or hero is going to come through with the challenge and everyone is going to live happily-ever-after.The tournament starts out fair and they keep playing through it, eventually everyone is eliminated except the two that face off in the end. It comes down to the last hole and Shooter swings an impressive hit that puts him ahead a little bit, as long as Happy doesn't get it in in less amount of hits. Unfortunately, an accident happens with a bystander and a big tower falls down blocking the course, Happy wants people to move it and go again when its clear, but Shooter says the rules say that once you start a hole you have to finish it. Gilmore takes this and has a flashback to when he went mini-golfing with Chubbs and how he had taught him to be the ball and to just relax and take a breath. Gilmore does just that and he ends up using the fallen over tower to his advantage to hit the ball like you would hit it if you were playing mini-golf, the ball bounces all over the place and eventually finds its way into the hole. This scene is very dramatic as you can imagine and when it goes in everyone goes crazy and starts cheering and celebrating. Gilmore gets a prize jacket and a trophy, but more importantly he gets money that he later uses to save his grandmas house.This is why I am not super impressed with this movie; it is funny but very predictable. But to come from the other side, it is just a comedy, ""a dumb comedy"" more specifically so it doesn't necessarily need to have some super in depth plot or some big surprise that happens. That's the whole point of this movie, it's just like a dumb comedy that makes you laugh even though it might seem un-intelligent or looked down upon. Even thought this movie might have a normal plot and is nothing special, it is still a good movie and it definitely made us laugh. I think the characters were chosen very wisely, the actual actors that played the characters and the actual characters themselves. They really complement each other and they build on each other, the main character wouldn't be the main character without his supporting characters and those characters really did help Adam Sandler in this case. For example, when Gilmore goes to the mini-golf course with Chubbs (Carl Weathers) they really improve Gilmores skills and help him basically win the tournament in the end and this is a key point in the movie. I think the casting director really hit it on the head. In conclusion I would say that to criticize this movie for having a cliché plot would be unfair and if that is the only thing I got out of this movie that would be a lie. Because this movie is a first of its time it is a classic. This movie is a knee slapper and I would say a classic, lots of people know what this movie is and have probably seen it. In the end this is still a very funny movie and I would recommend to anyone.",Happy Gilmore
280,coledrew,Happy Gilmore,8,26 October 2016,"Happy Gilmore is a great movie. It's a great movie for many reasons, the plot is fantastic, the script is awesome and Adam Sandler is hysterical. The 1996 film starring Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen, Christopher McDonald and Carl Weathers is a classic. Directed by Dennis Dugan, it is one of his bests along with other films like Big Daddy, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, You Don't Mess with the Zohan, both Grown Ups 1 and 2, Just Go with It and Jack and Jill. Being produced by Robert Simonds, this is also one of his best known films. Other notable films produced by Simmonds are Cheaper by the Dozen and The Pink Panther, This Means War and Big Daddy. Happy Gilmore is a rejected hockey player with a really hard slap shot. He gets cut from the same team every year but still tries out. He finds out that his grandma, who raised him as a child, house is being evicted. While playing around with some golf clubs he learns he can drive a golf ball really far. With help from his friend and trainer, Chubbs, he works his way up to the PGA tour in hopes to win enough money to get his grandma's house back. His antics attract an unusual crowd to the PGA tour which is good for business but other top golfers like Shooter McGavin think he's an embarrassment. Making $41.20 million dollars, Happy Gilmore is another one of Adam Sandler's best movies. The comedy was rated 7/10 of IMDb which is lower than what I believe it should be. I would rate the movie 8.5/10. 30 year old Adam Sandler is hilarious in this film and the acting over all is very good. Another reason I love this movie is because I think they did an awesome job attracting all audiences, I watch this movie with my family all the time. It attracts people of all ages. My younger cousins and my grandma and grandpa both love this movie as well. Over all, this movie is a classic. It has a very funny plot that is easy to follow for everyone. The actors assisting Sandler do a great job supporting him throughout the film. There are many hilarious scenes and quotes from Happy Gilmore. Most people have seen the movie already, but if you have not you definitely should soon.",Happy Gilmore
281,tommywiller,'Happy Gilmore' Hilarious and Heartwarming,10,21 February 2017,"Dennis Dugan, the director of 'Happy Gilmore,' did a remarkable job of making a comedic movie into a movie that you could truly relate to the characters and the story lines. Dennis Dugan also the director of 'The Benchwarmers', and 'Don't Mess With the Zohan', consistently can make the viewer amused, but these movies serve no justice to the plot of 'Happy Gilmore'. After watching Dennis Dugan movies, you are often left clueless on the point of the movie. With 'Happy Gilmore' you leave with the laughs and grow close with the characters, and the stories behind each character.In the move 'Happy Gilmore' there are multiple story lines that completely compel the audience. Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler), is the main character and deals with a tremendous amount of adversity throughout the movie. First and foremost, Happy's Grandmother, whom he loves dearly, loses her house. Happy's mission is to get the house back to his Grandmother. Secondly, Happy meets his crush Virginia (Julie Bowen). Happy does whatever it takes to win over her heart. Lastly, Happy needs to overcome the antics of his arch nemesis Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Along these seemingly reachable goals, Happy deals with an outrageous amount of setbacks to keep the viewer at the edge of their seat. Nothing is given to Happy, he needs to make everything happen himself through shear willingness, and devotion to the tasks he has at hand.With these main story lines, Dennis Dugan hit the jackpot. How could you possibly go wrong with a man seeking to find the money to buy his Grandmother's house back? Also, no one can dislike a man going after the woman of his dreams. These story lines could've easily been thought of as 'boring,' or 'not original,' but Dugan dressed up the plot and the story lines into an adventure that has never been seen before.Dugan's best decision was making Adam Sandler the main act. Adam Sandler as an actor always impresses me, and in this film he goes above and beyond. Sandler never has any trouble making people laugh in his films, but in 'Happy Gilmore' he's able to relate to the audience with his true feelings for the ones he cares about. I could sincerely feel the struggle that Sandler's character was going through to get the house back to his Grandma. Supporting actors such as Christopher McDonald, Julie Bowen, Frances Bay, Ben Stiller, and Carl Weathers do a great job to make Happy's emotions come alive. 'Happy Gilmore' listed as comedy, family, and sports genres could truly also be listed as a romance, and an action film. This movie truly encapsulates and brings out the best of all genres. Each scene, line, emotion, and expression contributed to an unforgettable ending.",Happy Gilmore

Everything works.........from the second shot knocking the woman out of the window to the kid getting hit by the baseball machine to Carl Withers with his arm (?) round the alligator. I would have a preferred a greasier (popular) anti-hero to play 'Shooter' but that may well have taken the point away from Stiller sending up the 'looser' movie. Being English, and a cricket fan, I can identify with Stillers legwork and arm swing in hitting the ball. It's a classic 'leg forward, bat following' technique. I wonder where he learnt that.

Apart from the comedy value of it which was pure classic Adam Sandler the guy just gets to me every time and I seem subtly drawn to his cute little smile in every film I watch. I don't know why it is but he just gives me a weird little tingle every time I watch him that I've only experienced once before in my life with a man I loved dearly but I really just think Adam Sandler is a beautiful god and really should have won an Oscar for this film because it was easily the sexiest film of all time.
