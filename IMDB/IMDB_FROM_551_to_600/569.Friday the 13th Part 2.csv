0,TheLittleSongbird,Introducing Jason,7,6 January 2018,"'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all of. Of the sequels, 'Friday the 13th Part 2' is one of the better ones easily and one of the few instalments to be as good, even on par. It's not perfect, it's not what one would call great. It does however achieve its primary goals well, it is scary and it is fun. Plus it introduces Jason Voorhees as the antagonist, so it is an important sequel in the series in this respect. Like the first 'Friday the 13th', 'Friday the 13th Part 2' is far from the best when it comes to acting. The exceptions are appealing Amy Steel and a truly freaky Warrington Gillette. Everybody else ranges from average to dead-end.Nor is it the best when it comes to dialogue. Much of it is very crude and cheesy. Or character development, and what the film does worse than the original is that we don't sympathise with the characters here as much apart from Ginny. The ending is a head-scratcher and pretty nonsensical, not the truly unsettling one of the first film.Visually, on the other hand, it improves over the original 'Friday the 13th' quite drastically. It's still creepy but has more of a professional, slicker look and like more time was dedicated to it. Like 'Friday the 13th', 'Friday the 13th Part 2' is very gory and gruesome, though not pointlessly so, but it is also very frightening and suspenseful. This is apparent in the deaths, which are still very creative and shocking, and the hauntingly eerie music score. 'Friday the 13th' is assuredly directed and moves along at a lively pace. As said, Steel carries the film with a good deal of appealing charm and Gillette proves why Jason is often considered an iconic character in horror. Overall, pretty good sequel and one of the better ones of a variable franchise. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Friday the 13th Part 2
1,Leofwine_draca,Quickie sequel delivers the goods,6,19 July 2016,"The first sequel was quickly churned out (only a year later) after the first Friday the 13th film proved to be a success. However, PART 2 has only a little of the atmosphere (generally created through fear of the unknown) that the original had, mainly because we all know this time around that the killer is Jason. Our killer doesn't wear the iconic hockey mask here but instead a sack on his head which makes him resemble the murderer in THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.On the plus side, the film has slicker production values which give it a much richer, glossier look, but apart from that its just another run of the mill slasher clone with a thin plot and lots of bloody murders. This time around the murders are not so varied or that bloody, and a couple (the machete in the face, the double spear-impaling) are directly lifted from that Mario Bava classic, BAY OF BLOOD. The rest of the film is full of the clichéd teen character skinny-dipping and arm-wrestling, the usual activities. There are lots of clichés in the film from the old jumping cat scare to the mysterious phone call.There were two parts of the film I really liked; the part where the heroine takes a chainsaw to Jason (although in a fit of stupidity she immediately drops the chainsaw instead of finishing him off), and the ending which threatens to be sentimental, but had a further shock. The acting this time around is even worse than in the first film, with all the characters being bland and emotionless, and nobody you care about. Even the lead, Amy Steel, is not as fleshed-out as Adrienne King was. The make-up case done on Jason is pretty good though and he looks much like you would expect, having grown up into a man from the first film but still being the same old deformed weirdo we all know and love.",Friday the 13th Part 2
2,SnoopyStyle,Better than the first,6,19 March 2014,"After the first movie, Alice Hardy (Adrienne King) is still haunted by Mrs. Voorhees killing everybody at the camp. Her nightmare comes true as she is killed off immediately. It's been quiet for about 5 years. A new camp is opened nearby to train camp counselors. It's not too long when the killings start all over again.This is a better movie than the original. The production value is superior. This is a no non-sense serial killer movie. Everything just look better than the original. There isn't a big future star in the mix, but Amy Steel is pretty good as Ginny. However it is still just a functional slasher movie and nothing more.",Friday the 13th Part 2
3,claudio_carvalho,The Slaughter  Part 2,6,28 December 2003,"A group of instructors having a training course are advised to go to another field in the next County, since the place where they are is close to Camp Lake Crystal. They ignore the advice and part of them is murdered by Jason, who is alive, living in the jungle with a deformed face. This film is just a sequel of Friday the 13th. The beauty of Amy Steel calls the attention of the viewer. My vote is six.",Friday the 13th Part 2
4,kosmasp,"Same same, but a bit different",7,5 November 2020,"I am just going to assume you have seen the first Friday 13th movie. I mean if you haven't ... why would you watch the sequel! It clearly states so in the title, that this is not the first one. Which makes it even crazier that this rehashes the last minutes of the first film. While Cunningham didn't get how or why they would bring back Jason Vorhees (he was dead, wasn't he?), Steve Miner took over ... and quite the job he had to undertake. Make the same movie but a bit different.So right from the start we get rid of what remained from the first movie (excluding Jason that is). And then we get more teenagers for him to be mad at. Why you ask? Does it really matter? Let's say because they can live a life he never could and he hates them for it. That should be good enough. We also get a final girl that is quite clever. Even if not as asexual as some might remember her. She's quite flirty isn't she? Rhetorical question that was.This sequel does not just see a different Jason actor ... it sees many of them. Apparently a lot of crew members literally stepped into his shoes. Though Steve Dash is the one who seems to take most credit for it. Some may question that, with other stunt man trying to make their case, but it seems he did the heavy lifting (or glass related stunt breakthrough) ... no pun intended.Since the first Friday movie was so popular but also had many people who were shocked at the gore it had (again quite tame from todays standards), this had quite the issues. Especially because it tried to outdo the first one. So quite a few things landed on the cutting room floor. While this has more blood then, it seems to have less nudity. Though that does not matter that much I think - it's more about the killings isn't it? I think most would agree.While this also contains Jason as character and killer, sort of the first time, it is not the Jason most might know, especially thinking of the later movies here ...",Friday the 13th Part 2
5,gavin6942,Let the Nonsense Begin...,7,22 April 2007,"A camp near Camp Crystal Lake opens, and the new counselors just can't wait to get a peek at ""Camp Blood"". Well, someone in that camp just can't wait to get more than a peek with them...I entitled this review ""let the nonsense begin"" because this is the part of the series where you have to turn your brain off almost completely. Jason is played by something like five different people over the next two or three films, so he constantly looks like a different guy. He seems capable of shopping at nice stores (look at those shoes) without being able to talk, earn money or drive a car. More than half the counselors in this film disappear and nobody ever bothers to mention this (I think the next film says there is ""one survivor"", but I could point out at least nine, especially one man who goes to the bar before the killings). And the biggest nonsense of all: a killer I have to assume is Jason that tracks Alice down to the city and is able to find her address and phone number. Without being detected. Amazing! Nonsense aside, there are some positive things to be said here. This is the first film directed by Steve Miner (producer of the first film), who also does Part Three and does later horror films ""House"" and ""Halloween H20"" to name a few. So he is a horror icon through and through. Adrienne King returns in a weird green jumper. And we even have the return of Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney), uttering what for me is his best line: ""I told the others but they didn't believe me. You're doomed, all doomed."" (or something similar) More nonsense includes how someone can look like an old woman just by wearing a sweater, or how that person knew that wearing such a sweater would make them look like that person. But I think I have said enough about the nonsense...This film introduces the adult Jason Voorhees, although a strange version of him with a sack over his head (apparently an homage to ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown""). We also have character Ginny Field (Amy Steel), who briefly returns in part three and Sandra Dier who plays a key role in part four. So some aspects of the next few films are set up in this one. Oh, and this also features the completely pointless six minute flashback that becomes a staple for the next few films. On the plus side, there is a reference to Mario Bava's ""Bay of Blood"" and a debut role for Stuart Charno, who later appeared in ""Sleepwalkers"" and ""Christine"".Otherwise, this is really more of the same. Kids hacked up in a wilderness camp. Lights going out. And the same music that at times is such an obvious ripoff of ""Psycho"" that it is sickening -- even worse a ripoff than the music from ""Re-Animator"" (or at least as bad). But if you liked the first one and want to see more hacked up kids or want to find out what happened to Alice Hardy or Crazy Ralph, here you have a chance for that.",Friday the 13th Part 2
6,lee_eisenberg,Jason and the blood-stained fleece.,10,12 February 2006,"So, the man synonymous with the ""Friday the 13th"" movies finally gets to do his stuff (if you've seen the original, then you know what I mean; if not, then see it so that you understand). Five years after the original, Camp Crystal Lake has closed for good, but a camp across the lake is opening, so I shouldn't have to explain what happens. There's pretty much everything that one would expect. You'll have to determine what you personally think of the wheelchair scene (you just may end up reciting the last line from ""Dr. Strangelove"").It's weird to think. Jason was originally the man in the Greek myth who got sent to find the Golden Fleece; now he's associated with a hockey mask-clad slasher killer (actually, he doesn't wear the hockey mask here). And obviously, my 10/10 rating only applies for people who would actually take any interest in such a movie.",Friday the 13th Part 2
7,jboothmillard,Friday the 13th Part 2,4,21 November 2009,"From director Steve Miner (Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, Lake Placid), this first of many sequels introduces the iconic character that would rule the series. You may remember, a younger looking Jason Voorhees jumping out of the water, pulling Alice Hardy (Adrienne King) underneath, just after she killed his mother Pamela (Betsy Palmer), and the opening has her stabbed in the temple with a ice pick. Five years later, a Counselor Training Center, at Packanack Lodge, near Crystal Lake Camp is opened by Paul Holt (John Furey), and he is joined by many other counsellors. A couple of the counsellors are getting too curious about the camp near them, especially hearing the legend that Jason (Warrington Gillette) didn't drown in the lake, and soon enough, one by one, they face the psycho's wrath. Jason may not be wearing the hockey mask yet, he is instead wearing a bag, but he witnessed his mother being killed, and he is not afraid to kill at least nine people in nasty ways. Also starring Amy Steel as Ginny Field, Kirsten Baker as Terry, Stuart Charno as Ted, Walt Gorney as Crazy Ralph and Marta Kober as Sandra. This film isn't as exciting as its predecessor, especially the copy-cat ending, but the introduction to Jason and the quite well done graphic and gory impaling of characters is worth watching. Okay!",Friday the 13th Part 2
8,Woodyanders,Worthy first sequel to the original,8,28 January 2013,"We all know the drill: A merry group of attractive young folks go into the woods nearby the notorious Camp Blood. Naturally, Jason shows up to spoil their fun in the most brutal manner possible. Director Steve Miner and screenwriter Ron Kurtz cover all the essential body count bases in a satisfying and straightforward manner: Amorous happy-go-lucky young adults smoke weed, drink booze, do the deed (or at least get ready to do same), and die in various gruesome ways. This first sequel basically plays like a slicker and more streamlined version of the original, with Peter Stein's polished cinematography in particular utilizing a smoothly gliding Steadican with impressive results. Harry Manfredini's shivery ooga-booga score adds immensely to the overall spooky atmosphere. Adrienne King briefly reprises her role as Alice while Walt Gorney makes the most out of his regrettably limited screen time as the gloriously loopy Crazy Ralph. Moreover, Amy Steel as the smart and perky Ginny qualifies as an extremely fetching and appealing final girl. This movie further benefits from a tasty array of fine-looking ladies: Yummy frizzy-haired doll Marta Kober, the insanely cute and foxy Lauren-Marie Taylor, and, last but certainly not least, the positively delectable hard-bodied stunner Kirsten Baker, whose sizzling skinny-dipping scene rates as an undeniable highlight. The filmmakers deserve extra credit for their take-no-prisoners grim approach to the material (for example, the harsh machete-in-the-head murder of likable disabled dude Scott is genuinely shocking and tragic). Alas, a majority of the goriest bits had to be trimmed in order to secure an R rating, so the kill set pieces don't quite pack the full punch that they could and should have. A solid slice'n'dicer.",Friday the 13th Part 2
9,Tweekums,A solid sequel that keeps the best elements of the original and builds on them,8,10 December 2018,"In an opening sequence, set months after the original film we see sole survivor, Alice Hardy, having nightmares about the events at Camp Crystal Lake before being murdered. The action moves forward five years and a new camp has opened up on the shore of Crystal Lake. The events involving Jason and his mother have passed into folklore with rumours that Jason still stalks the woods in the area. As the new councillors arrive they talk about Jason but nobody is really concerned; some even want to walk the short distance to the old camp. Inevitably it isn't long before the murders start again; although the campers don't immediately realise that they are being picked off one by one.If you enjoyed the original film then this is certainly one to watch. It opens well with its reminder of what went before followed by the surprising death of Alice. Things then slow down a bit as the new characters are introduced; while none of them are killed till around the film's half way point they are some scares as we are fooled into thinking one or more characters could be attacked... there are also a couple of murders involving side characters. Once things really kick off the tension quickly rises as the killer starts killing the young councillors. These murders are quite shocking but not excessively gory. The cast might have been picked because they look good in short shorts and tight tops but they do well enough and look genuinely scared when they are meant to. Amy Steel does stand out as Ginny Field. Overall I'd say that if you were a fan of the original film you should watch this; if you didn't like the original you are unlikely to want to watch this.",Friday the 13th Part 2
10,BA_Harrison,Jason's body-count starts right here!,8,9 December 2008,"Ding Ding! It's Round Two of the Camp Counsellors vs The Voorhees Death Match, and first to bite the dust is sole survivor from the original film, Alice Hardy (Adrienne King): she gets an ice pick in the head from Jason (Warrington Gillette), who is out for revenge for the death of his mother.Having finally dispatched of this particularly troublesome teen, the deranged, straggly haired freak returns to Crystal Lake, where he bides his time, worshipping his mum's severed head at a candle lit shrine. Five years later, and Jason's patience eventually pays off: a camp counsellor training centre is opened only a stone's throw from the site of the original massacre (what a great idea!), and it is full to the brim with nubile young women and men ripe for the slaughter.Steve Miner's follow-up to the hugely successful and highly influential slasher Friday the 13th might seem more like a remake rather than a sequel, since the story hardly breaks new ground, but thanks to its stylish direction, better dialogue, and likable characters, it proves to be a lot more fun than its predecessor.Miner's deft handling of proceedings means that the film never drags between kills (a major flaw of the first film), offering some entertaining and plausible interaction between the characters, plus the obligatory scenes of nudity, sex and skinny dipping featuring attractive young women: smokin' hot babe Kirsten Baker's naked night-time swim is most impressive; Amy Steel's heroine is pretty yet spunky; Marta Kober sure knows how to work a bikini; and even good-girl Vicky, played by Lauren-Marie Taylor, attempts to get naughty.As far as the death scenes are concerned, they aren't quite as graphic as in the first movie (if Savini has supplied the FX, this film would've been an absolute stonker), but they come thick and fast and the film has enough scares and tension (Jason in his burlap sack mask is pretty damn creepy) for one to be a little forgiving about the lack of blood.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Friday the 13th Part 2
11,Quinoa1984,Somewhat exceptable,7,8 October 2000,"Now, while I don't find any of the 13th films scary that much (probably my immune system has been built up against badly made horror films), I found that this fiolm was Ok by some standards, and, it is needed in case your in Scream.  Here, 5 years after the slayings in part 1, teens return to the same area for camp counseling, but find another killer is on the loose, a crazy (and un-dead) man with a potato sack on his head (creative huh). Younger teens will probably find this entertaining, but for anyone who has seen much better than this will find it standard.  C+",Friday the 13th Part 2
12,BandSAboutMovies,What's that thing about copying and flattery?,4,13 April 2018,"Of course, there was going to be a sequel. Sean S. Cunningham refused to direct it because he was against the studio plan to bring Jason back from the dead. He said that it was too stupid and would never work. Hmm.Beyond a plan to be an anthology of stories on Friday the 13th (which sounds a lot like the plans for Halloween), another thought was that Alice would be a reoccurring hero in this series, continually facing off against Jason again and again in sequel after sequel (again, think Halloween and Laurie Strode). Sadly, after was stalked by a fan, she said she wanted out (she even stayed out of acting for a long time).That's why this movie starts with her death. I always wondered why this happens, because it invalidates all of the emotional investment that you put into the last film!So of course, everyone decides that re-opening Crystal Lake would be a great idea.We've got Ginny (Amy Steel, April Fool's Day), Sandra, Jeff, Scott, Terry, Mark, Vickie and Ted, who sit around a campfire and listen to the legend of Jason. Even Crazy Ralph from the last movie shows up to warn everyone before getting killed.Here's my problem with this sequel: it rips a lot off. Jason doesn't have his trademark hockey mask, so he steals the look of the Phantom of The Town that Dreaded Sundown. And then there's the issue of taking two murders shot for shot from Mario Bava's A Bay of Blood. A machete to the face and a couple stabbed together by a spear? Attention director Steve Miner: Bava did it first and better. Miner would go on to direct Halloween H20, so his sins are many.Just like Shakespeare, everyone dies. Except Ginny. She discovers Jason's altar to his dead mother and ends up stabbing him in the should with a machete. And then the movie does another shock ending, making you think Jason survived. He, of course, did not. Or he did. You know how these things go.My question is: Did Jason rise from the dead? Or was he alive in the forest all these years? And how did he learn how to use a telephone? Let's just stop asking questions.",Friday the 13th Part 2
13,Coventry,"Well, the sequels are off to a bad start ...",3,7 November 2003,"Spoilers ahead...I never really did understand the success of the first Friday the 13th film. It was enjoyable but it doesn't really deserves to be so huge as it is and after watching the first sequel... I really wonder why they even continued making more and more sequels. I guess I'm a late Jason fan. I really enjoyed parts 4,6 and 7 and I agree that Jason is a true horror icon in those movies. Friday the 13th part 2 is a rather boring movie and pretty identical to the first with the difference that Jason does the nasty himself this time. What I really missed was some sort of background or even flashbacks about Jason growing up all alone in the woods. I think a more detailed portrait of Jason building up his insanity would have added a lot of value to both this episode AND the series.  The link with the original is laid by killing the last survivor ( naturally ) but that's it. This episode ( a complete Steve Minor project) is filled with clichés and predictable twists but he doesn't seem to care. The whole thing takes place at the opposite side of Crystal Lake were a group of young people take a course of becoming a counselor. It's been 5 years since the original massacre.
Movies like this are merely being remembered for their original killings or perhaps a tiny little twist. The slaughterings in F13 part 2 are nothing special to say the least ( even the ones in the original were much better ) and I hardly call that ending a ""twist"". There are a few pretty young girls to admire in this film and - like it has to be in a slasher - they are pretty horny and barely dressed most of the time. But, if that's what you're looking for ...there are other genres to satisfy you... Not recommended !!",Friday the 13th Part 2
14,hitchcockthelegend,Here's Jason!,6,13 September 2008,"We open with a tension filled sequence as Alice, the only survivor from the bloodbath of Camp Crystal Lake, dreams about her encounter with Mrs Vorhees, the murderer responsible for all her friends getting killed. An eerie atmosphere exudes from the picture, the sense of dread hangs heavy, and sure enough the dread is about to be realised........Sadly it's all down hill from that moment on, Friday The 13th Part 2 appealed to me many many years ago when i was a spotty teenager, back then any sort of blood and nudity was the pinnacle of cinema as far as i was concerned. Revisiting the film now, it's clear that it really doesn't have a great deal going for it. One thing the modern horror audiences learnt from Wes Craven's Scream franchise, is that teens in horror films are stupid, all lining up to be bloody blade fodder at the hands of a maniac. Formula remains the same, the girls run around in ridiculously short shorts, their bosoms bouncing with care free abandon, the blokes get horny and as we now know, any sort of sex results in a horribly grizzly murder. The deaths here are at least a bit inventive, and the first presence of Jason Vorhees at least gives the film a more solid, and decidedly evil axis to work from, whilst the score from Harry Manfredini, a sort of Psycho/Jaws fusion with wisps of death, is highly effective.It just gets bogged down by characters nobody cares about and acting that belongs in a Russ Meyer picture. The Friday franchise does have the odd picture that scores high in in the horror entertainment stakes, part 2 falls somewhere in between OK and dreadful, an uneasy 5/10 from me.",Friday the 13th Part 2
15,Hey_Sweden,The carnage continues.,8,17 March 2012,"""Friday the 13th Part 2"" is good, straightforward slasher fare that plays a formula for all it's worth. Its story (mostly) takes place five years after the events of the first movie, when a camp counsellor training centre has been set up in the Crystal Lake area. For five years the area has been quiet, but that's about to change, as the arrival of a new batch of nubile victims will spur Jason Voorhees to murderous action, as he inherits the mantle of crazed backwoods mass murderer from his late mother Pamela.This sequel announced the emergence of Jason as a prominent slasher icon in a big way, and he's a truly evil creep in this one, and still more or less human, as opposed to the unstoppable zombie he would become in later sequels. While not ignorant of the iconic status of the hockey mask, this viewer has to say that he really likes the ""pillow sack"" covering of the face in this entry. The Jason face makeup is good if not too consistent with the way he looked in Part 1. Sadly, the trimming down of key gore scenes definitely dilutes their impact, although there's still a delight in the way he stalks his victims as the preludes to the kills.Director Steve Miner keeps the story racing forward; if it weren't for that extended, 12 minute plus pre-credits sequence that reminds the audience of what has come before, this would be quite the short movie indeed. Even so, it runs a mere 87 minutes. The woodsy setting works just as well as before, and Harry Manfredini's instantly recognizable score adds to the fun just like it always does.The cast does acceptable work, with Amy Steel as Ginny making for an appealing and intelligent ""final girl""; the best in this series in this reviewer's humble opinion. A psychology major, she actually attempts to mess with Jason's mind in order to get the upper hand, and doesn't do too bad a job. John Furey is likable male lead Paul Holt, a guy scrappy enough to give Jason a good fight. Stu Charno is great as geeky comedy relief guy Ted, and Kirsten Baker as Terry supplies some wonderful eye candy, especially as she goes skinny dipping. A treat is in seeing Adrienne King, Betsy Palmer, and Walt Gorney return to their previous roles; Gorney is just as hysterical as ever as doom sayer Crazy Ralph. Fine cinematography (by Peter Stein) and production design (by Virginia Field) are assets - Jason's isolated decrepit dwelling is truly a marvel to behold.All in all, Part 2 is one of the best sequels in this franchise by far, a solid continuation to one of the definitive slasher movies, delivering enough laughs, shocks, and thrills to make this a fine hour and a half or so of no-fooling-around entertainment.Eight out of 10.",Friday the 13th Part 2
16,preppy-3,Boring sequel,4,22 July 2006,"I'm surprised I've taken this long to tackle the Friday the 13th horror movies. I'm a huge horror fan---you think I would have done this sooner. After seeing this I realize why I was hesitating. Anyways...This film starts off with long, boring 12 minute opening going over the first film and seeing Alice (the only survivor) being killed with an ice pick to the head. It happens only a few weeks after the end of the first film and she is killed by a full grown man who turns out to be Jason---but Jason was dead AND only a kid at the end of the first one! That's one hell of a growth spurt! Five years later another summer camp is being set up NEAR Camp Crystal Lake. The new counselors are told Jason's body was never found (??) and some people say he's grown up alone in the woods (???) and attacks anyone who comes near his place (????). This contradicts everything in the first movie! Still it does contain the films only spooky scene when this is told around a campfire.Anyways Jason attacks and starts killing the counselors. Why? They're not ON Crystal Lake just near it. The film has dull dialogue and next to no plot. Here's a few observations: Counselor Terri (female) has a dog named Muffin (GAG!). A guy named Scott asks her to dance--she refuses and he picks up the dog and dances with her!!! There's a tasteless shot showing Muffin (GAG!) about to be killed to a hot dog on a grill.Terri skinny dips for no reason--at night--with no one around--and no lights.There's one reasonably well-done killing.We see Jason actually MOVING the bodies--you never see this in a slasher film.Jason has a stupid sack over his with one eye hole--the hockey mask came in Part III.The final chase between Jason and Steel is actually well-done because Steel acts very smart. Good music too.Tasteless scene #1--Jason getting kicked in the groin.Tasteless scene #2--Ginny and the mouse under the bed Tasteless scene #3--The guy in the wheelchair getting the machete in the face.An ending that made me jump and made no sense either. Where is Paul? And Muffin (GAG!)? Where are they taking Ginny? There are only 8 killings (5 guys, 3 girls which is surprising) and they're all pretty bloodless. The MPAA came down hard on this picture because the original was attacked for being too gory. So--most of the murders were cut down severely--about a minute of footage is gone. One infamous scene (the double impaling) was cut to almost nothing! Even if the killings had been left intact it probably wouldn't change the fact that this is one dull movie. The cast is actually not bad--but the dog named Muffin was a bit much. Amy Steel especially was good and I admit to liking Tom McBride too. But the script is boring and the actors are given no characters to play--heck I didn't even know ones name until she was killed! The lapses in logic and Jason's age (and size) were annoying. Also this movie supposedly takes place in 1985 (it was shot in 1980) if we believe the first movie happened five years ago! It is well-directed by Steve Miner though. He has since proved that he is a good director--he just didn't have a story here to work with. Also this established the have sex=be killed (although the screen writers said it was unintentional). Aside from Steel this is not that good. I can only give it a 4.",Friday the 13th Part 2
17,poolandrews,"The first Friday the 13th to feature the infamous Jason, solid entry in the series.",8,11 June 2005,"Friday the 13th Part 2 starts with the surviving Alice Hardy (Adrienne King) having a nightmare about the events of the original Friday the 13th (1980) in which she beheaded mass murderer Pamela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) with a machete & had a close encounter with her supposedly dead son Jason. It's been several months since the gruesome events at Camp Crystal Lake & Alice is trying to get her life back on track, however her progress is cut short when one night she finds Mrs. Voorhees severed head in her fridge & is then brutally killed by having an ice pick shoved into the side of her head. It's now been 5 years Camp Crystal Lake has been closed & abandoned, the surrounding area is trying to forget about the horrific legacy left behind by Mrs. Voorhees killing spree. Two teenagers, Jeff (Bill Randolph) & Sandra (Marta Kober) drive into town looking for a new counsellor training centre that has recently opened in the area, just across the lake from Camp Crystal in fact. A old man known as Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney) warns them both that they're ""all doomed"", Jeff & Sandra ignore his ramblings & continue on their way. The new camp is run by Paul Holt (John Furey) & his girlfriend who doubles up as his assistant Ginny Field (Amy Steel, apparently her character Ginny Field is named after Virginia Field this & the original Friday the 13th's production designer), there is a good turn out & things start well. After some initial light training Paul says that the hard works begins tomorrow & anyone who wants to have a big night out do it now. Half the group go & half stay behind, those staying include the attractive Terri (Kirsten Baker) & her unwanted admirer Scott (Russell Todd), Terri's friend Vicky (Lauren-Marie Taylor), a guy in a wheelchair named Mark (Tom McBride) plus Jeff & Sandra. But there is someone else there as well, as the rain begins to fall & lightening starts to strike a mysterious hooded figure is stalking the camp brutally killing everyone one-by-one...Produced & directed by Steve Miner Friday the 13th Part 2 is a solid entry in the Frday the 13th series of films which have become my favourite horror film franchise & Jason my favourite killer, I have to say that I really missed the iconic hockey mask Jason has for the remainder of the series though as here all he gets is a bag over his head. The script by Ron Kurz is not a huge departure from what has gone before, or indeed since. It isolates a group of typical teenagers deep in the woods & has Jason kill them off in various ways. I found the stalking & slashing in this entry pretty neat, director Miner manages to create some decent tension & a few scares. The script throws in a bit more motive for Jason's killing spree than usual as it suggests that Jason is out for revenge after witnessing his Mother's death & whose head he still has on a table surrounded by candles. But what it basically all boils down to is that these films are all about the kills & they're pretty good in Friday the 13th Part 2 even though it's obvious that they are censored, which is a shame. There's an ice pick in the head, a machete slitting a throat, a double impalement, someone has a hammer whacked into the the back of their head, Jason cuts someones throat with some wire & someone ends up with a machete planted in their face. While none of these murders are particularly graphic I liked them, as usual Jason is unmasked at the end & here he looks like a deformed man rather than the rotting zombie he would latter become. The teenage character's are clichéd for sure but having said that I thought they were surprisingly all quite likable & no one really annoyed me, well except Jeff I suppose but then there's always one isn't there? The cinematography by Peter Stein in Friday the 13th Part 2 is very stylish & classy, the daytime shots are very rich in colour & the nighttime shots are well lit to create a good atmosphere. As a whole the production values on Friday the 13th Part 2 are above average & it has a nice polish about it. The cool sounding score & especially the main theme by Friday the 13th regular Harry Manfredini is unmistakably Friday the 13th & I think adds a little something all on it's own. Overall I'm a huge fan of the Friday the 13th series of films & this is a good one, while not terribly original it goes about it's job with professionalism & turns out to be an enjoyable slasher. You know what to expect so have a reasonable level of expectation & I'm sure most slasher fans will find something here to entertain & enjoy.",Friday the 13th Part 2
18,Bunuel1976,"Friday THE 13TH PART 2 (Steve Miner, 1981) BOMB",1,22 October 2006,"I've only ever watched the first and last films in this neverending series of slashers - Friday THE 13TH (1980) and FREDDY VS. JASON (2003); neither was any good, and this second instalment is, if anything, even worse! Following the stupid misadventures of a number of fun-loving teens for 90 minutes would test anyone's patience - and, with that in mind, I decided to watch this a day earlier and leave PART III for Friday the 13th itself (which is actually the only reason I lowered myself to renting such outright trash!)... While there's plenty of violence (a couple making out in a bedroom are speared right through - directly ripping off not just Mario Bava's giallo TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE [1971] but the original Friday itself!), this is mostly relegated to the second half: we have to suffer first through a long-winded prologue (reprising virtually the entire climax of the first film) and oodles of exposition in order to pigeon-hole each and every one of the teens (but, then, a few of them get lost in the shuffle - the irritating geek, for instance, never returns from the night on the town!), plus make perfectly clear (unless it may go above some particularly feeble-minded audience member's head) the fact that their camp is situated next to the infamous ""Camp Blood"" (Brrrr!). Still, the unseen murderer (outside of the last shot, that is) device grows tired pretty quickly (where's the iconic figure of Jason wearing an ice hockey mask, anyway?!), as does the plot contrivance of isolating individual members of the cast - thus marking them all too obviously as the next victim (at least, a couple of the girls are attractive and even get to shed their clothes)! I guess you can all elicit from this negative review that the slasher subgenre, in my estimation, is about the lowest point in the horror spectrum!",Friday the 13th Part 2
19,utgard14,"""These kids smoke better dope than I do.""",6,9 April 2014,"The first Friday the 13th sequel follows the formula with more camp counselors showing up at Camp Crystal Lake and being slaughtered one by one. This is the first of the series where Jason is the killer, although he doesn't yet have his iconic hockey mask. He wears a sack over his head instead. He also gets kicked in the nads. Pretty funny, honestly.The cast is full of young actors playing obnoxious teens and twenty-somethings. Adrienne King briefly reprises her role from the first film before Amy Steel takes over as the 'final girl.' Acting-wise, Steel's an improvement I think. This one also has more cute girls than the first movie and more nudity, which would become a prerequisite for the series. The tracking shot of Kirsten Baker's rear end as she walks through the woods is priceless. As with the first movie, I really liked the locations they filmed at. Gives an authentic atmosphere to the film without appearing cheap, like most of today's low-budget horror films do. If you like old-school slashers, you'll like this one. It's solid entertainment that you don't have to take seriously, despite the macabre subject matter.",Friday the 13th Part 2

21,Boba_Fett1138,Enjoyabe genre piece and sequel.,6,24 October 2009,"This movie continues the Friday the 13th franchise and set the standards for all of the later sequels. In this movie the killer this time is really Jason, while in the first movie it was still never the film-makers their intention to make of the Jason character a serial killer to make an entire movie franchise out of.The movie is like everything you can expect from a genre movie and it's mostly being very formulaic. Fans of the genre will find very little true originality in this one and also little surprises in it's build up and execution. Again it's mostly a movie that is all about a bunch of young people being killed one by one, while they are at a camp, nearby the Camp Crystal Lake from the first movie, despite old cycling crazy Ralph's warnings.So the movie does very little original or surprising but it also does very little wrong. That means that this movie is simply an enjoyable and also good enough genre piece to watch. As a sequel it also serves its purpose at further expanding the Jason Voorhees rampage and set the tone for its further sequels. After this movie it became all the more obvious they had all the intentions of turning this into a long running series of movies. i just wished some of the killings within this movie would had been a bit more original. It's strange that in this movie some characters are being killed in the same way. Also lots of blood and gore got cut from the eventual print, to avoid getting a X rating. It has as a result that the movie is fairly tame with its graphic killings and blood. You really feel that they were holding back, while watching this movie, also with its nudity.A typical genre movie that does very little wrong but also offers little originality within its genre6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Friday the 13th Part 2

23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"What, were you expecting a clever title?",6,17 January 2011,"Following the events of the first, a survivor recalls events from it(shown in clip form, to eat up a bit of the already meagre 81 minute sans credits screen-time... also, it's not even the best of the average picture they remind us of), writhing in agony of how unimpressively it was done, ending with her waking up abruptly from remembering waking up from a nightmare. No, really. She's apparently drawing mildly unsettling images(faces with red, black and yellow on them) to get over the trauma, as well as taking five-second showers(yes, I get what it's supposed to be... it's poorly done, deal with it, don't make excuses for it). Then a new batch of 25-year-old supermodels are finding Chrystal Lake... oh, wait, no, it's one close to it(and it makes a huge difference! Like... uhm... oh... uh... nevermind), and they get warned on the way... this time only by Crazy Ralph(my favorite from these two... how can you not love this guy, he shows up, tells people they'll die, and either walks or *bikes* off), solidifying just how much this one is phoning in the build-up(we hardly get any stalking, the largely uninspired death scenes come out of nowhere and again end instantly, so we don't have time to get afraid before it's already over, with the exception of the OK opening and the genuinely suspenseful ending), also exemplified in the way the backstory is told(yes, the campfire setting is good, still, that's *it*). As such, the majority of this is forgettable and barely, if at all, works as you're watching it. The acting is awful again, if some of the dialog is better. Humor remains lousy. The chicks are hotter, and dress it(lots of butts in tight shorts, and some tops, too). I understand this is about how the rest of the films in the franchise are... sad. Jason's look is changed and it's great. The mythology is slightly expanded upon. There is some sexuality, nudity, violence, gore and blood in this. The DVD comes with a meh theatrical trailer. I recommend this to those desperate for a mindless slasher-flick. 6/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
24,kevinolzak,The final premiere on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater,2,15 January 2021,"1981's ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" followed the Sean S. Cunningham original on to Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater a year apart, among only three 80s titles to appear for Chilly Billy (1981's ""The Fan"" popped up in between). Associate producer Steve Miner succeeded Cunningham in the director's chair, the major obstacle being no killer, Mrs. Voorhees decapitated in spooktacular fashion for a bravura finale, so why not just bring back long dead son Jason to now avenge his mother? (never mind that they had 23 years to find one another since his 1957 drowning!). For the uninitiated who walk in without thinking, they might be forgiven for believing this was Cunningham's opus minus the gore, the MPAA ratings board not allowing Carl Fullerton the same latitude with makeup effects as Tom Savini, leaving only a series of relatively bloodless murders in easily telegraphed stalking scenes devoid of any suspense. So slavishly does this film copy its predecessor that, once Adrienne King's Alice is dispensed with before the opening credits, it's the exact same story only with more nubile girls and an even greater emphasis on sex. Jason can't possibly kill off over a dozen lazy teens once the picture reaches the midway mark (another long wait to see any bloodshed), so half of them go off for a night on the town while the few remaining are sitting ducks, literally in the case of one unfortunate in a wheelchair. Much has been said about the straight rip off of two imaginative killings taken from Mario Bava's ""Antefatto"" from 1971, pared down to almost nothing, one a machete to the face, the other the impaling of two lovers in bed with a spear. This is less a sequel than a cynical paint by numbers retread, done on a higher budget but without any passion or feeling (it managed to earn only half the box office of the preceding entry), a pity that this would set the template for a seemingly endless number of follow ups that almost but not quite reached an interminable 13. Chilly Billy dipped his toe in the water of this new decade on three occasions, but quality trumps quantity, the 'mad slasher' era quickly descending into parody as John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" receded further into the past.",Friday the 13th Part 2

And Mrs. Voorhese wasn't the killer. They were close to Camp Crystal Lake, aka Camp Blood, and now we get to see Jason in action.There are even more horny nubile young men and women to prey upon and they are right next door to Camp Crystal Lake doing counselor training. They are learning first-aid and other survival tools. Too bad for them that training doesn't include serial killer survival.This is pre-hockey mask Jason so he's just a rookie. He learned a lot from his mother and even improved upon her killing tactics. He's a master stalker. He never gives his position away until he's ready to strike.

He wears a really creepy pillow case or something over his head instead of his hockey mask, and it's actually a scarier effect than the more iconic image--he should have stuck with it. There's a long prologue in which the only survivor from the first film eventually gets an ice pick in the forehead, but only after she's been repeatedly scared by the phone, a cat, etc. This opening is actually pretty nerve-racking, and it sets the tone for the rest of the movie, in which the kills are more original than the first (I'm a particular fan of the handicapped kid who gets a machete in the face and then is sent bouncing down some garden steps in his wheelchair) and the nudity is more bountiful and gratuitous. I'm not even going to try to justify my enjoyment of slasher movies---they speak to the basest instincts in all of us and are really morally repellent, but, hey, I like what I like.One of the better episodes in the interminable series.Grade: C+",Friday the 13th Part 2

What she doesn't realize is that the son of Mrs. Voorhees, who goes by the name of ""Jason"" (Warrington Gillette), has somehow tracked her down and is out for revenge. He gets what he came for and the scene now shifts back to the general area of Camp Crystal Lake where some new counselors are attempting to establish a summer camp again. Unfortunately, Jason lurks in these same woods and he is even more dangerous than his psychotic mother ever was. Now rather than reveal any more of this film I will just say that I thought it was almost as good as the original movie. If nothing else it seemed a bit more polished and greatly benefited from the same general recipe for success as the first film. Likewise, all of the young ladies were certainly attractive with Amy Steel (as ""Ginny"") and Kirsten Baker (""Terry"") probably standing out the most. In any case, I thought that this was a pretty good horror film and recommend it to those who might enjoy a movie of this type. Above average.",Friday the 13th Part 2

What really works here for this one is the rather fun and simple back-story here, giving this a great set-up that's really worthwhile in generating a fine slasher epic. The fact that the introduction to the campers here at first which isn't a rather bland, boring set-up that's actually rather fun instead is a big part of that, and when mixed with the effectively eerie stories about the legacy of the area and it's grizzly history in just the right doses this here is incredibly fun. Once the main slashing section starts off, there's a lot more fun here as the film gets in some outstanding chasing and stalking sequences, from the sheriff running through the woods towards the abandoned camp after the shadowy figure, encountering the couple searching in the woods and then to the highlight offerings of the slaughter against the campers where this one piles on a series of incredibly brutal, clever kills that are real show-stopping moments with the most noteworthy a machete slammed into a paraplegic's face and forced to roll down three flights of stairs backward as such, though on the whole the deaths are truly fun and thrilling. There's little to appease, though, of the rather exciting and thrilling final chase here which is one of the best and most thrilling chases in the entire genre as there's so much action spread throughout the scene as the chase rages through camp, out into the woods, throughout the cabins and finally back to the old campsite in a lengthy, scary sequence that gets quite fun not only for the surprisingly smart battle tactics use to try to escape while in the woods but also for the sequence of events in the cabin at the end where the psychology utilized to hold that whole scene together is a clever, unique and totally original idea that's wonderfully played off here. These here hold this one up quite well as there's not a whole lot of flaws. The biggest issue here is the rather lengthy and wholly unnecessarily long intro here, which takes up fifteen minutes of time not only offering a recount of the previous film's finale but also with her rambling about the apartment and it could really use a trim to make it less lengthy.

32,Wuchakk,Serious retread of the first film with some differences,8,29 July 2014,"I'm fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise even though I'm not a gorehound and only occasionally watch slasher flicks. It has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I I saw 1985's ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" on TV one night in the late 90s. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young people in a fun camp-type environment in the woods; the presence of an unstoppable killer, who increasingly becomes a hideous monster over the course of the series, adds an air of danger and suspense. Include scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise.Released in 1981, one year after the first film, ""Part II"" is basically a retread with different characters, a different killer and a different camp on the same lake, not far from ""Camp Blood,"" i.e. Camp Crystal lake. In reality, the film was shot on an entirely different location; specifically Kent, Connecticut.It's interesting how none of the films were shot at the same location even though, typically, the location in the story is the general vicinity of Camp Crystal Lake. The locations of the films in the series include northern New Jersey (I), Connecticut (II), Southern Cal (III, IV, V & IX), Georgia (VI), Alabama (VII), British Columbia (VIII & XI), New York City (VIII), Toronto (X & XI) and Texas (XII).It's the camp-like settings of most of the franchise and the unrelenting monster that is Jason Voorhees that especially sets ""Friday the 13th"" apart from similar franchises.Concerning the tone, the first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the series introduced a campy element in Part III, which plagued several subsequent entries (V, VI, IX & X) until the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway; still, I prefer the serious tone. Speaking of which, the only thing questionable about the first film, as far as realism goes, is how the killer is able to throw an adult corpse through a window or hang a body from a door, etc. But I suppose these things can be attributed to the powerful psycho Voorhees gene (or the demon thing disclosed in 1993's ""Jason Goes to Hell"").Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some chilling atmospherics, some of the others as well, but, with the exception of the 2009 reboot, I don't find these movies particularly scary. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not scary. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes. There are numerous jump-scares, of course, but that's not what I'm talking about.Part II doesn't overstay its welcome at a mere 87 minutes. It introduces the adult Jason Voorhees, but he's noticeably smaller in stature and more human than in later sequels. A couple of times the main protagonist, Ginny (Amy Steel), is able to deter him fairly easily (like opening a car door or kicking him in the groin). Speaking of Ginny, she's a fine heroine in the manner of Alice in the first film and Pam in Part V. Kirsten Baker plays the requisite hottie, Terry, and the filmmakers don't fail to highlight her beauty. Unfortunately, the ambiguity of the ending is inexplicable.GRADE: A-(If you wonder why I rate a film like this so highly, I'm grading it according to what it is: a slasher flick. No genre is beyond redemption or above contempt and this one delivers the goods).",Friday the 13th Part 2

So if you haven't seen part one you can pick this up without a problem, but if you have seen part one then it's better that you fast forward until th e pre-credits. But again, Friday the 13th part two had his problems, a lot of the gore was cut out and was never seen afterwards. The two scenes where you can feel the cutting is the spear going through a couple. You see the spear going towards the bodies and you never see it going through the bodies. They had to cut that out. So the gory shot was left out! The ending should have been the decapitated head of Mrs Voorhees smiling but it looked ridiculous so the left that one out and didn't have a real ending, so again, they freezed on her head and edited it with the end credits. But it also takes over 40 minutes before things really starts. The first killing is after 30 minutes but again, nothing really happens, okay, a nude scene is given to keep you watching, but the killngs aren't gory, and Jason wasn't scary at all.

Friday the 13th Part 2 finally introduces Jason Vorhees, but he doesn't wear his famous ski mask just yet, just a clothe of some sort.

But they might wanna change their mind when a big man in a hooded clothe comes to terrorize them and ruin their day. But we discover that it is Jason Vorhees, he's returned from the grave to avenge his death as well as his mother's. The poor and horny teens are brutally slaughtered and it is up to Ginny to get through this horrible night.Friday the 13th Part 2 is over all a pretty fun film, not as good as the first Friday th 13th film, but it's decent enough to give another watch. I really hope the upcoming sequels are just as fun. Although I'm still not too into Jason, it's all good, he still delivers a good scare with the best death scenes.

One by one, they fall victim to a new menace, the alleged Jason Voorhees.Like the first movie, there are plenty of scares, screams, gore and running around. The acting performances were a notch-up from the previous film and even though it's still a typical teenager horror flick, the characters, I thought, were a little more likable and heroic, especially Amy Steel as Ginny and John Furey as Paul.The plot is pretty basic, with a lot of running around, slashing and screaming, and the elements pretty much match the first movie. But, there is still enough tension and excitement to leave you entertained.Grade B-",Friday the 13th Part 2
40,sddavis63,Jason Takes Over!,6,6 January 2010,"Somewhat to my surprise, I enjoyed the first movie of this series. It had, of course, something of a psychological thriller bent to it as well as being part of the ""slasher"" genre, the killer there being Jason's mother, who wants to avenge his drowning death which was caused by the negligence of camp counsellors. This sequel loses the psychological bent. The killer now is Jason himself, this being explained by the fact that his body was never found, so he didn't actually drown. Apparently he was just wandering in the woods all that time (which makes one wonder why he didn't make his survival known to his mother, since in the first instalment she really didn't seem to know he was alive) and now he wants revenge, having watched his mother get killed. (The opening scenes apparently tell us that Alice, who in the original movie killed Jason's mother, does herself get killed in a rather bloody fashion - and although it wasn't made entirely clear to me that it was Jason who did it, it still made for a good addition to the story told around the campfire!)In any event, without the psychological angle around his mother, this movie is a bit less interesting than the first. It's set at a neighbouring camp (Camp Crystal Lake now being off limits) that's being used to train camp counsellors. As slasher films go, it's pretty standard, with all the normal components you find in such films (although not as bloody as it might have been): a lot of young women in various stages of undress, a lot of young people making out or getting ready to make out, a lot of young people getting killed, a lot of things going bump in the night, and acting that while not terrible is also not great. Routine stuff all this may be, but the movie still has some pretty effective chills and thrills to it. Jason's hockey mask is missing - here, he wears some kind of sack over his head - and now that the typical slasher genre is introduced, one wonders where the series can go - although it obviously did go! As slasher film series go, however, this particular movie isn't a bad sequel at all. 6/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
41,thesar-2,Killer Kameras from outer Kamp,5,14 January 2009,"Here we go again  the killer kameras from outer kamp. To me, growing up on the series, and now, as an adult, the scariest scenes in horror films, are the ones where I can actually see the killer. Part 1 did the killer's POV the most and 'Friday the 13th Part 2' follows suit, but focuses more on his, well, shoes, if that's scary. I loved the revenge/reminder of Part 1 opening, but it was a bit long at about 16 minutes into an only 86 minute film, or basically 20% just for an intro. Five years, or one to us, after the killer was hacked (loved how the blade is delivered from right to left, but the head falls to the right) in Part 1, a new group of unsuspecting 20-somethings start up a camp for underprivileged youths. Okay, that's just a set up to a slaughterhouse. My main question is: if this killer, (no spoiler here) Jason Voorhees, is so bent on avenging his mother's death  which he already did 2 months prior to the events in this film  how does anyone get anything built in these woods? If these woods are so ""cursed"" then how come the construction crew and delivery people can come and go, supplying the grounds with new cabins & stock and leave alive? Joke! That's not what these films are about. It's about nude females, sex and horror, and to me, the horror begins with the proximity of where they show the killer (well, killer's shoes) to all the nobody victims and really picks up when we finally get to see 'The Town that Dreaded Sundown'-copycat killer Jason. Just as part 1, this could've been the finale and speaking of which, it does contain the most frightening and creative ending in the series.",Friday the 13th Part 2
42,bensonmum2,My favorite of the series,7,27 August 2005,"It's been five quiet years since a group of councilors were murdered at Camp Crystal Lake. But when a new group of councilors arrives to open a nearby camp, the killing starts all over again. Who's behind the murders? The original Camp Crystal Lake Killer is dead. Could it be her son who was believed to have died in the lake years earlier? By the time someone figures out who the killer is, most everyone else is dead.Friday the 13th Part 2 has always been my favorite installment in the series. I've always thought that Jason was more frightening before he found the hockey mask and became the unstoppable iconic killer zombie. This Jason is human and that makes him more real. And, to me, the horror factor is increased when the killer is based in reality. He's a primitive being (not unsimilar to the inbred mountain men I recently wrote about in Wrong Turn) capable of extreme brutality, out to avenge the death of his mother.Most of the movie is about what you would expect - grisly murders, an absence of logic, woeful dialogue, and iffy acting. Friday the 13th Part 2 also features just about every horror cliché that fans have come to expect in a teen slasher. When I saw this movie in 1981, a lot of what we consider teen slasher clichés were still being developed. Back then, a lot of this was still fairly new and fresh. And whether I should or not, I still see the movie the way I did in 1981.",Friday the 13th Part 2
43,gridoon,"Forgettable and worthless, but moodily directed.",5,23 November 1999,"While you're watching ""Friday The 13th, Part 2"", it's important to forget for a while your normal requirements from a movie. The characters are pitifully uninteresting, the ending is super-idiotic, the whole movie is cheap-looking, exploitive and trashy in the extreme. However, what distinguishes it from the other early ""Friday The 13th"" outings is the moody, atmospheric direction and the reasonably tight pacing. Miner (who made the far, far inferior ""Part 3D"" the following year) uses many point-of-view shots that are maybe even more effective than the similar shots in the first ""Halloween""! So, while the film is about as bad as the offensively inept ""Final Chapter"" in terms of characters and acting, it is possibly the best of the series in terms of directing. And it is a HUGE improvement over the original.",Friday the 13th Part 2
44,lost-in-limbo,Camp Crystal's living myth.,7,10 October 2009,"After the success that was 'Friday the 13th', a sequel was inevitable with Part 2 coming out a year later hot on the heels of the slasher boom (and also Part 3 which was done in 3D by director Steve Miner). Part 2 basically continues on where the original finished, having Adrienne King's character return but not for too long. And this is where the legend Jason would make his mark as the unstoppably merciless killer, after scaring audiences in the original's shock ending but before the iconic hockey mask entered the picture this tall, lanky figure wore a simple potato sack with one eye hole that I found far creepier. As for the instalment itself, for me it was the most eerie of the lot, as unlike the latter films, I didn't entirely find it just a body count set-up but more so playing out like a spooky cautionary campfire tale of consistent atmospherics and cheap shocks. After 'Part 5: the New Beginning', I thought the series just lost that raw, primitive edge that made me simply adore the early catalyst films of the series. Part 2 and 3 would be my favourite of the lot with a more human-based, but dangerously scavenging Jason who wore some nicely polished black shoes on this occasion. Yeah the down-to-earth photography seems to focus on his legs and shoes. Miner's cheap looking entry has obvious intentions of exploiting its clichéd formula of violence, sex and drugs. However after it's opening recount and booming jolt it goes on to settle down (time the fresh meat ah I mean teenage counsellors to muck around with Jason ominously lurking about), but eventually after setting the mood it comes off its leash to open with a quick one by one concession of unsparingly brutal deaths and storm up an exhilaratingly non-stop cat and mouse chase between Jason and the central female heroine (an affably strong Amy Steele performance). As for the baffling ending, make what you want of it dream or not its unnerving. Harry Manfredini's highly effective score is pulsating, but at the same time chilling with a knife cutting through the air like quality. Miner's competently taut and precise display is basic to limiting itself to the budget restraints, but suitable with moments of little tension, even though it's constantly telegraphed and modest make-up FX work. There's a real authenticity to the performances with the likes of John Furey, Stuart Chano (a fun comical turn), Kristen Baker, Lauren-Marie Taylor (truly adorable and one of my favourite Friday 13th girls), Marta Kober, Bill Randolph (with these being look-a-likes to Kevin Bacon and Jeannine Taylor's characters from the original), Russell Todd, Tom McBride and Walt Gorney returns as crazy Ralph who ends up not following his own ominous warnings too bad.Unpleasant trash maybe, but its passable stalk-n-slash.",Friday the 13th Part 2
45,Robert_duder,Body count continues is right...just more bodies stacking up,6,25 March 2009,"The tagline for Friday the 13th Part 2 really says it all. ""The Body count continues."" While there are some significant points to this sequel ultimately it is simply an epilogue to the first film. There isn't anything wrong with that but the story in this second film is barely existent. It's just Jason going on an enormous rampage following the actual story of Part One. There are two significant things about Part 2. First of all we get the finality of Jason catching up with Alice Hardy from the first film. And secondly you have the fact that Jason Voorhees becomes the sole psycho killer for the rest of the series. Basically they simply wanted to show this fact so the story line for this installment is weak, even more weak than the usual slasher story lines. The cast is there simply to get picked off and have no personality or even the guts or style to go up against the killer. Nonetheless Friday The 13th Part 2 gives fans plenty of killer gore, plenty of Jason and that's really what it's all about. Unfortunately a sequel should be more than an epilogue especially under the pretense of serializing and Lord knows they serialized Friday the 13th.What can really be said about the cast? Much like the first installment the cast is very campy and they aren't really looking for any solid acting parts. Adrienne King returns briefly from the first film. She was terrible in the first film and proves to have learned nothing about acting in this installment. Still she doesn't last long and it's good to have the main character from the first film come back. With a background in Soap Operas Amy Steel plays free spirited Ginny in her first film role. She does okay but there is still some element of really cheesy acting to her, maybe it's the script. A gentlemen who went on to Soap Operas, John Furey plays her love interest and the male ""hero"" Paul. Honestly he barely lifts a finger and never really plays hero in any way. Still they are decent together but I think he could have been and done a lot more. Warrington Gillette takes over the role as the hulking killer Jason. He shows the strength but somehow lacks the personality that others have managed to show with emotion and body language. I would go through the rest of the cast but honestly none of them stand out one bit. They all have their roles as victims but ultimately they don't do themselves any justice.Considering this was director Steve Miner's first film, but certainly not his last, it might have taken him this film to really learn the horror genre. I think he might have struggled picking up the film where the first one left off but he gets to try it all over again for a third installment which I will review very soon. The bottom line is simple if you're willing to sit down for the entire series which any horror fan or slasher fan or Jason fan must and will do then you have to watch this installment. It isn't awful, and it is entertaining, it just isn't the best of the series but every series will have it's speed bumps and you have to watch all of them, the good and the speed bumps. Still part of a classic series with some important classic moments for Jason. 6/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
46,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"While it was invariably a profitable decision to retroactively raise the now iconic killer from the dead, it isn't capitalised on here.",5,13 April 2018,"While the decision to retroactively resurrect the series' now iconic, somewhat supernatural serial-killer, who was entirely absent from the first picture and actually little more than a background plot device, was invariably a profitable one for the franchise as a whole and the reoccurring 'Jason' character has certainly been captured into the pop-culture zeitgeist, it makes for a questionable concept at best - even though consistency isn't something the series would become known for. Shoehorning in an entirely new mythology messes up the motivations of the prior title. It's a shame, then, that the filmmakers didn't use their newfound villain and his masked mug to their advantage in 'Friday The 13th Part 2 (1981)'. They didn't learn from perhaps the biggest mistake made in the first film, as the killer is still hidden for most of the run-time which restricts what is shown in the worst possible way because there's no reason for it. There's no mystery or suspense built from the omission, as was attempted previously, and the violence is also bizarrely restrained (in reality, due to pressure from the MPAA). This means that the flick can't even claim to have that real visceral edge that the original had, though. Another major problem is the distinct lack of plot. The feature essentially adds up to a bunch of teens going to a camp before a killer kills them all, which feels like it came from a half-written outline that was rushed into production far too early, likely the case considering it hit theatres only the year after the first, even though there are some decent sequences (like the ending) sprinkled throughout the brisk narrative. 5/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
47,bowmanblue,Probably should have been the first film,7,23 October 2014,"'Friday 13th – Part II' is better than the original 'Friday 13th' film. And it isn't. What it is, is EXACTLY the same film, just done again. If you were to put Friday 13th on one television and Part II on a TV next to it, you'd feel you were looking at the same film on both screens.The first film was phenomenally popular, so the makers obviously decided not to stray too far from the original concept. Once again you have a group of annoyingly attractive teenagers who go to a summer camp to pair off and have sex then get murdered (and not particularly gorily by today's filmic standards). They get slaughtered one by one until you're left with the only girl who hasn't had sex. She is then stalked, while constantly screaming and running away from the killer until the traditional climax. Occasionally the 'action' is broken up by an ugly man wandering into the camp to try and warn the kids, only to also get murdered.You really could just watch this film as 'Part I' as it's technically better, even though it's basically the same story. Plus the 'reveal' of the killer was more satisfying this time round.I also couldn't stop thinking of 'Blackadder II' when he puts a bag over someone's head. Here, the killer also wears a bag (and is therefore about as scary as an episode of Blackadder).The early Friday 13th films are more about 'horror history' now than genuine scares. You can watch them for nostalgia value and to see how horror used to be done. However, they're filled with every cliché that the 'post-modern' horror films (such as 'Scream') make a living out of ridiculing. Enjoy them for what they were, not how they come across now.Should really be 3/5 stars for its lack of originality, but 4 stars if you haven't seen the first one.",Friday the 13th Part 2
48,cricketbat,Even less plot and character development than the first one,4,5 October 2020,"I think Friday the 13th Part 2 has even less of a plot than the first movie. This one doesn't even have any sort of interesting twist at the end. It's just a group of one-dimensional camp counselors getting killed off one-by-one by a killer with no personality. The story is so predictable that it isn't scary, and it doesn't make a lot of sense, either. Some people may enjoy this sequel, but I found it to be lacking.",Friday the 13th Part 2
49,CuriosityKilledShawn,Mommy has a reward for you.,6,23 November 2006,"Before the blood was dry on Pamela Voorhees' machete the producers were already at work on this sequel, which is basically the same thing all over again. Though I prefer the characters in this one and it does move a lot faster (and end quicker, slightly to its detriment).Alice Hardy has apparently not recovered from the emotional stress of lopping Jason's mommy's head off, and apparently the not-really-dead Jason was watching from the woods when she did so. Doing what any loving son would do, Jason shoves an ice-pick into Alice's head.Flash-forward five years to 1984 (the first movie was apparently set in 1979 according to Pamela Voorhees' tombstone) and a bunch of camp councillors go through training at a new facility not too far from Crystal Lake. Some of them wander a little too close to Jason's woods and end up getting splattered. Thin on plot, but thick on eye candy. There are some very attractive girls in this one and wear wonderfully revealing clothes. Especially the wonderfully lithe Norwegian actress Kirsten Baker. She's probably the sexiest of all the girls in the series.Part 2 is much more attractively shot than the drab, grubby original, with slick photography, longer takes, a clear sense of space and place. It's so odd that a series once critically derided now represents how to effectively shoot and edit horror in an age when so many are over-produced and insulting to one's intelligence. The deaths are bit more creative this time around too, though it's a bit cruel of potato-sack wearing Jason (who usually kills by a set of rules) to axe a crippled guy in the face. Jason stays in the shadows for most of the running time and only begins his massacre towards the end. He doesn't have superhuman powers yet, and feels more like the adult special needs child he was always intended to be.As with all most movies in the series there's not much tension as the characters never know that they are in danger until Jason slaughters them. I should give it a pass in this regard as it was an early sequel, and despite not featuring many of the tropes and visuals associated with the Friday the 13th series it's a good movie and superior to the first.",Friday the 13th Part 2

This introductory part will not mean much to those who did not watch the first film, while it will only bore those who did. Then follows the film so boring that I barely made myself to see it through. The film itself is not so bad and, if I did not watch the first part, I would probably rate it five out of ten. But since I watched the first movie recently, and this one does not bring anything new, but merely continues pouring sand in the desert, I was terribly bored.

52,ironhorse_iv,"This movie get a lot campy as time goes on, but at least, Part 2 wasn't too stupid. The movie does have its scary moments. Jason really hates counselling.",6,13 February 2015,"Directed by Steve Miner, the film marks the first time Jason Voorhees (Warrington Gillett unmasked/stuntman Steve Daskawisz when masked) is the antagonists in the film series, as his mother, Pamela (Betsy Palmer) was the killer in the previous film. Jason Voorhees's motive is crystal clear in this film. It is a direct sequel to Friday the 13th, picking up five years after that film. He has to take revenge on Alice Hardy (Adrienne King) who killed his mother in the conclusion of the previous movie. After that, he must try to get rid of the rest of the camp counselors in nearby training camp. It's just another manic Friday for him. Originally, Friday the 13th Part 2 was not intended to be a direct sequel to the 1980 original, but rather part of an anthology series of films based around the Friday the 13th superstition. Like the Halloween film franchise, after the popularity of the original film, villain attacking the heroine, the filmmakers decided to bring back Jason and the mythology surrounding Camp Crystal Lake, a trend which would be repeated for the rest of the series. Stylistically, Friday the 13th Part 2 had a lot of the same elements that made the original Friday the 13th a sleeper hit in 1980, such as first-person camera perspectives, gory stalk-and-slash scenes with the same eerily music, and sex/nudity. One of the biggest problems of the film is trying to connect this to the previous film. The movie took forever to recap the last film. This film has one of the longest pre-credit sequences in cinematic history, nearly 15 minutes in some versions. The main different between this film and the last is the lack of suspense. You know, whom the killer is, this time. It's also, sucks that the movie series lacks a strong ""it girl"". I was really hoping for a strong female protagonist like Ellen Ripley from the Alien film series or Laurie Strode from the Halloween series in these films. It kinda sucks that the final girl, Alice Hardy from the last movie was kill off, pretty quick in the beginning. Adrienne King was pursued by an obsessed fan after the success of the original Friday the 13th and wished her role to be small as possible in the sequel, because of that. I really find it very odd that the movie has her being stalk and killed as if she was being attacked by that crazy fan. In my opinion, she should had refused to retake the role, until the problems of her personal life was taken care of. Ginny Field (Amy Steel) is alright replacement. The final girl often shares common characteristics: she is typically sexually unavailable or virginal, avoiding the vices of the victims, very sympathizing people that becomes masculinized through ""phallic appropriation"" by taking up a weapon. Ginny is nothing like the common final girl. Ginny has a lot of vices, sleeps with her boss and mostly catatonic and useless in the end. It undermines the notion of positive final girl. The whole idea that she can pass off as Voorhees mother by wearing her old sweater is a bit goofy. I wasn't impressed with any of the actors acting here, but honestly most of the supporting characters were pretty likable. None of them, had any of the mean-spirit traits, the later films would later put on. It's weird that the teenagers that went off to drink and party, didn't die first in this film. It's weird that the movie would even have the nerves to kill a character with a disability like Mark (Tom McBride). Kirsten Baker as Terry was very sexy, and pretty much, worth watching, just to see her nude scenes. Jason was still pretty sinister, despite, not yet, dawning the hockey mask. The potato sack mask kinda remind me of 1980's Elephant Man in how creepy it was. The movie gorn is pretty intense. The Make Up work is just as good as the first film. The movie had to be cut by approx. 1 minute to secure the R rating, and not an X rating. Some scene, the editing is clearly visible. As of today, none of the cuts have been restored in any way, even with newer release DVDs. The movie really had a cop-out when it came to the dog, Muffin. It's so weird, that the movie preach, it's alright to killed people in a horror, but don't dare, kill the dog. I guess, the movie didn't want to anger PETA. The film's ending has been a source of confusion for fans. Writer Ron Kurz has stated that Jason's window jump was intended to be, like a jump scare like the first film in reality. However, like the beginning of this film, the beginning of Part III, in replaying the end clip, showed Jason jumping into them, as if a dream. In an unused ending, after Ginny questions where her boyfriend is, the scene switches to Mrs. Voorhees' head, which then opens its eyes and smiles, indicating that Jason had killed him. Overall: It's just a carbon copy of its predecessor that it's slowly turning into what the film series is known for. It's not bad, but it's not the worst. It's just mediocre. Worth checking if you want to have cheap thrills.",Friday the 13th Part 2

I was astounded how generic and lifeless the first movie was and this sequel isn't far off.Here in Jason Voorhees's debut before he finds his iconic mask he is remarkably bad. What I mean by that is he's a bumbling incompetent fool and a shell of what he is destined to become. A couple of scenes near the end of the film are almost comical because of how bad he is at being a killer.With mostly cutaway deaths, very thin storyline and little to set it apart from every other camp slasher film I'm starting to wonder how this franchise reached the pinnacle it did as I'm 2 films in and not impressed in the slightest.The Good: Follows directly on from the original Well cast The Bad:Jason really used to suck!

56,tomgillespie2002,"An improvement on the original, but still a pedestrian slasher",4,22 February 2012,"After narrowly escaping death in the first film, Alice (Adrienne King) is in recovery when she is murdered by an unknown killer. After dreaming about being dragged into the water by Jason Voorhees at the end of the original, the apparently dead son of mass-murderer Mrs. Voorhees, rumours spread that Jason is out for revenge after seeing his mother decapitated. Five years later, a fresh bunch a naive horny teenagers arrive at the rebuilt Camp Crystal Lake for some relaxation time. Soon enough, murders start occurring and it becomes clear that a masked Jason is indeed out for revenge.The main problem with the Friday the 13th franchise is that every film seems to be a re-hash of the previous, and this is no exception. The basic premise of an unknown killer stalking clueless teenagers is exactly what happened in the first film, except this time it has a bit of a trump card in Jason (played by Warrington Gillette). Mrs. Voorhees was a rather lame and unrealistic reveal in the climax of the first, and although he is yet to don his iconic hockey mask (here he wears a flour bag with an eye hole), he makes for a much more effective and physically intimidating killer.But the film doesn't really have any effective or memorable murders, which, let's face it, is why you watch a Friday the 13th film. The only scene worth any mention is the killing of the boy in the wheelchair, which provides an unintentionally hilarious moment that sees him rolling down the stairs backwards after being stabbed. It also has possibly the most annoying horror character in history who not only has the nerve to survive the film after disappearing half way through, but is also ginger.

Revisited it recently.
Planning to go on a Friday the 13th marathon.
This second installment picks up five years later, where new killings takes place, not at Camp Crystal Lake but at a nearby training camp.
Now this is unfair as nobody is starting the bloody Camp Crystal.
More than 6 mins r spent on the flashbacks of the first part.
It has some nudity, lots of kills n the same cliches of the last girl beating the assailant down but not making sure that the assailant is dead.
It also has a big chase by a fat cop.
Felt sad for the physically challenged guy, he never got the opportunity to get laid with Vickie.
The skinny dipping scene of Kirsten Baker is an eye candy. Her tight body n glutes is well appreciated by a trainer like me.
This is for the first time audiences get to see Jason's face which may remind the new audience of the killer from Hatchet.
The use of the sack hood is similar to the 1976 film The Town That Dreaded Sundown.This one has lots of q's.
How did Paul survive, what happened to Paul in the end, why in the end no cops bothered to look around or why no cops came across Jason's hut. Why no search was done for the missing fat cop since his last trip was near the camping area.
How did Jason manage to survive so long in the forest going unnoticed, if Jason didn't drown in the first part n he saw his mom go on a killing spree n he even saw her decapitation, why he never bothered to confront her mom....It has the iconic death scene (single spear n two bodies) inspired from Bava's Bay of Blood.",Friday the 13th Part 2

61,insomniac_rod,Solid Slasher flick from the 80's. You can't get much better than this.,9,23 August 2004,"The best thing about this movie is that it proves that a Slasher movie CAN be scary AND gory. Part 2 demonstrates that suspense, gore, and all of the Slasher elements can be combined and deliver great results.Part 2 came when it had to; in the time where the Slasher genre was very popular and when suddenly hundreds of movies like this came out.""Friday the 13th part 2"" had the BIG advantage of being the direct sequel to the movie that created the 80's love for the genre. The Friday the 13th title helped this movie to stand out from many other movies from the genre. Everyone had to watch this movie in order to confirm Jason's existence after his shocking appearance at the end of part 1.*SPOILERS* As everyone knows this time Jason is the killer at Camp Crystal Lake and it's nears. At the beginning of the movie Jason takes revenge on Alice (the counselor that decapitated his mother in part 1) by killing her and then heads to Camp Crystal Lake to start his first killing spree. Five years have passed since the camp re-opened and after the tragic events that led to Mrs. Voorhees death. A new group of counselors seem to ignore the curse over Crystal Lake and settle down just to be killed one by one by Jason Voorhees.I like this movie very much for many reasons. First and most important is Jason's debut as a killer in the genre. After this movie Jason started a legacy that doesn't seem to have expiration date. In this movie Jason is very frightening. He wears a sack with one hole and old dirty clothes. He has little but quality screen time. His appearances are filled with creepiness as he's a mysterious being. There's no proof that he died or that he's still a human and that's what makes him so scary. The acting is surprisingly good. Amy Steel as Ginny is by far the most liked Friday the 13th lead female character. She's a good horror actress and considered one of the best Scream Queens. I can say that she's among the Top 5 of the 80's. Solid performance Mrs. Steel. The other cast members weren't required that much so there's nothing much to say about them except that they did it o.k. There are classic moments in this movie that are well remembered by the fans and genre lovers. Jason's P.O.V. when killing Vicky, the double impalement on bed, Scott hanging from the tree, Crazy Ralph's death, Jason getting beaten down, the thrilling chase scene in the woods and the unexpected ending are stuff for legend.The characters were very likable to the point that you feel sorry for some of them. The death scenes are great here. There's plenty of gore and many inventive deaths. My favorite has to be the infamous double impalement on the bed. A classic in the series and in the genre.The music is perfect. It totally works for the movie. Violins and cellos were never that scary. Many have tried to copy the Friday the 13th music but nobody has managed to do it correctly.The ending is suspenseful and you can say shocking. You don't expect Ginny to wear Jason's mother's sweater and apply her Psychology knowledge on him. Ginny used her child Psychology studies on Jason and good for her that she survived because of them. This is something that deserves a special mention! Intelligence and beautiness work together and can beat a demented killer. You won't see something similar in other movies from the genre.""Friday the 13th part 2"" is a scary Slasher movie. Believe me, that's something that not many movies on it's kind can brag about. One of the best Horror movies of the 80's in my opinion. Watch it even if you're not interested in becoming fan of the Friday series. It's a solid Horror movie.8/10.",Friday the 13th Part 2
62,Anonymous_Maxine,Whoa! A good sequel!!,6,5 April 2003,"I say that, of course, in reference to the expected quality of a movie like this. In general, horror series like the seemingly endless Friday the 13th series are composed of one hugely successful original film (generally, by today's standards, inexplicably so, despite the abysmal standards of today) followed by a lot of stomach-turningly awful sequels that try in vain to recapture the success of the original film. The first sequel in the Friday the 13th series, however, seems to escape that trend, although it never manages to be much better than the original, which wasn't that great in the first place. But at the very least, even the Austin Powers series went more precipitously downhill than Friday the 13th.The movie takes place several years after the original ended, and since Mrs. Voorhees was the real killer in the original (which we all know because we've all seen Scream) and was beheaded at the end, we now have to have a real killer. The thing that helps this movie escape the treacherous realms of the sophomore effort is that it presents the story so well. Jason has lived in the woods since his mother was killed (a horrifying event which the young Jason witnessed), not interacting with a human being in any way in all those years. In order to seek revenge for his mother's murder, he has been savagely stalking and murdering anyone who comes close to his area of the lake.Not exactly the most intricate storyline, but at least it's not some mindless killer running around killing any teenager daring enough to get involved in any kind of sexual behavior (an extremely popular motive in cheesy horror movies). In this case, promiscuity is punished because Jason supposedly drowned because the counselors who were supposed to be watching him were making out when he was screaming for help.There is a cheesy fireside scene where one character explains this whole thing to all of the teens who are out there training to be counselors, which obviously ends with one person in disguise jumping out of the bushes screaming and scaring the hell out of everyone around the fire. The movie then jumps into auto-pilot for most of the film, becoming your typical slasher movie, but at least they took the time to explain why all these killings were happening, right?This makes me wonder, however, why they would cover Jason's face with a cheap piece of bedsheet with a little hole torn in it for one of his eyes. They've seen Halloween! They know the effectiveness of an expressionless mask, so why not be a little more creative here? The only reason I can think of is that Jason lives in the woods and doesn't exactly have access to things like the costume store where Michael Meyers got his mask, but he did have access to axes and machetes and candles and whatnot. Surely in all those years he could have come up with something at the very least a little more comfortable to wear or easier to see through.At the very end of the film, by the way, we are treated to a close up and slow motion look at Jason's real face (something that we never get to see of Michael Meyers, although we almost do in one of the films), as he leaps through a window to grab the last girl left alive. And what a face! No wonder nobody wants to play with him!As far as the killings themselves, Friday the 13th Part 2 fits in with most other 80s slasher films, which are little more than exercises in coming up with new and interesting ways to kill people, because we already know the formula from countless slasher films made before. In this case, there are certainly some creative murders, and the film even confused me with feelings of sympathy for Jason near the end, particularly when he is holding his arms up trying to get away from the chainsaw.The poor guy! Someone killed his mom for avenging his death, and he's lived in the woods alone his whole life! He's the victim here! Okay, I wouldn't go that far, but I definitely felt badly for the poor guy when he fell off the chair and then almost got chainsawed. But luckily he's soon back on his feet (even after almost being cut completely in half with a weak swing of a machete) goring people with big scary knives and reminding us of the dangers of messing with him. Or, as it were, being anywhere near Camp Crystal Lake.This is also, by the way, the last time that any sympathy can be felt for anyone dumb enough to go up to the lake. The rest of the sequels are filled with people who deserve to die anyway for being so dumb. Well, at least his mask improves from this point on.",Friday the 13th Part 2

Tongue and cheek dialogue, bad acting (sometimes good, depending on the performers), humor, some shocks, nice T and A, and of course, bloody carnage, and this unimpressive sequel does have these moments, a great jump scare in it's end. We kill off the last survivor, make way for the new batch. I like a couple of surprise moments in this, and this movie doesn't suck. I just expected more, where age does wither these films. Really, nothing goes beyond the great guest performance of the Vorhees mother character, and we do know with Jason, you can't keep a good psycho down, and his own living quarters with his trove of buddies, is a s**thouse. I really did like the suspense leading up to the end. Again we have a survivor.... so we know what that means.

65,GOWBTW,My second personal favorite movie!,9,24 January 2006,"When you thought you got a latter favorite FT13th movie, not all are that bad. The first one was a thriller and a chiller. The second one is better. More babes, more fright, the more intense. My favorite character in the movie is Ginny(Amy Steel). This is her start before the TV show ""The Powers of Matthew Star"". Ginny is one of the best looking babes in the movie, second is Terri, whoever's next? Who cares. A new killer is out and about wreaking havoc in The Crystal Lake area. And for Jason Voorhes? He's here, without the famous hockey mask. This is a start of a the terror that haunts Camp Crystal Lake. With Pamela Voohees headless, the new threat is worse than Pam herself. I like the people who hooked up with one another, I liked the one who changes her top and her panties. That scene is one of the biggest teasers in the movie. Terri is the one with Muffin the dog was a real athlete, she got popped with a pea-shooter, then gets her clothes stolen while skinny-dipping in the moonlight, at least she was still alive at that time, that scene worried me a little bit. She looked good with her hair all wet. I'm glad that Muffin was the other survivor in the movie, the question is, ""Who was the other dog that got killed?""

67,jadavix,For completists only,5,10 April 2019,"""Friday the 13th Part 2"" has all the same problems of the first movie, but none of its good things. It too doesn't have a single character that makes an impression on the audience, and when the ""hero"" finally emerges, it seems like they were chosen at random because these movies need someone to survive.The ""good things"" it misses are the gore effects of wizard Tom Savini that made the first one memorable. We don't get that here, as Savini didn't return, and a bunch of the death scenes were cut to avoid an X rating.There's not really a whole lot to recommend ""Part 2"" for, then. The ending does have some non-boring moments, but it's really for completists only.Yes, this is the first ""Friday"" in which Jason does the killing, but many of the people involved in the production of the first movie have talked about how stupid that is. If he survived his ""drowning"", why didn't he just go to his mother and prevent all the killings in the first movie? How did nobody discover this weird kid living by the lake all those years? How did he survive, and grow into such a strapping and lethal adult?",Friday the 13th Part 2

Viewers will have to wait until part 3 for him to don his iconic hockey mask. Like the first movie part 2 benefits greatly from Harry Manfredini's soundtrack. The pace of the film & nudity have also been turned up a notch. However, 48 seconds of gore & violence were removed at the request of the MPAA, so sadly the gore is down from the original (Mrs Vorhee's beheading is thankfully repeated in all it's glory). The film does also have a few gaping plot holes - how did Jason survive all this time? How did he track down the Final Girl from the original?

69,dee.reid,"""Friday the 13th, Part 2"" - More of the same, but you know what? Here's Jason!",6,22 January 2011,"I'm no fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" series of slasher films; I think they're pale imitations of the ""Halloween"" series and were only made as cheap competition, but have nonetheless been highly influential over the years and have earned their own devoted, more-than-obsessive cult followings. Jason Voorhees has to be the most boring screen slasher ever. I don't particularly like ""Friday the 13th"" (1980), but I did like the first sequel in the series, 1981's ""Friday the 13th, Part 2."" To get this out of the way, ""Friday the 13th, Part 2"" is a superior follow-up to the original film; I really like this sequel, even though it is a stretch to say that it's a lot better than the first film.The reason this film succeeds is because it has better writing (by Ron Kurz, based on original material from the first film's screenwriter Victor Miller) and way better direction from Steve Miner. While this film still has many faults - due to it rehashing many elements from the first film, production problems that are most likely a result of a limited budget, and a horribly MPAA-butchered picture - ""Friday the 13th, Part 2"" stands on its own as a superior film to the original.""Friday the 13th, Part 2"" is set five years after that bloody night in ""Friday the 13th."" A group of camp counselors have opened up their own camp not far from the now-infamous Camp Crystal Lake, the site of the original bloodbath in the first film. Someone - Could it be Mrs. Voorhees's long-believed-dead son Jason? - is offing the poor unsuspecting camp counselors during one terrifying night at the camp.""Friday the 13th, Part 2"" is a slickly made little gem of a slasher flick. I commented earlier on the problems that are most likely a result of a low budget, but Miner's direction keeps the film on-track after a slow beginning, including a brief re-cap of the first film (which also happens to feature first-film survivor Alice Hardy - returning actress Adrienne King - getting brutally dispatched within the first five minutes). Here, as in ""Friday the 13th,"" you also see a lot of the cliché slasher film moments start to ingrain themselves in this series, its sequels, and every imitator that followed. You also won't find any Oscar-worthy performances here, either, but lead Ginny (Amy Steel) gets some points for some last-minute improvisation that ultimately ends up saving her life from bloodthirsty Jason.But of course, ""Friday the 13th, Part 2"" is most famous for being the actual debut of Jason Voorhees. He has yet to dawn his infamous hockey mask (he wears a burlap sack over his head to hide his grotesque facial deformities), but he's just starting out here and, boy, does he take great delight in slicing up hormonally-charged young people. I also don't think he has any of the supernatural powers granted to him in the later sequels, but here he is still a deadly force to be reckoned with, even though the film is also genius in making this brutal killer almost seem human and frail just when it seems like his bloodbath is showing no signs of ever relenting. His many, many kills are quite gory - even if trimmed by the MPAA - but lack the creativity of special effects wizard Tom Savini's innovations on the first film; also be on the lookout for the sexiest ""Jaws"" parody ever filmed early on ""Friday the 13th, Part 2.""""Friday the 13th, Part 2"" is one of the few examples of a superior horror sequel. It's a lot better than the movie that preceded it, that is true, but only by a very narrow margin. I personally enjoyed it a lot more than ""Friday the 13th,"" because of Steve Miner's direction and the film's tension-filled last 20 minutes. The climax of ""Friday the 13, Part 2"" are some of the most intense moments ever in a horror film, and they have to be seen to be believed.6/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
70,kevin_robbins,It packs a punch for slasher film fans and ties the first movie in very well,7,13 May 2021,"Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981) is a movie I recently watched from my personal collection. The movie takes place five years after the first film when a group of camp counselors are in the process of opening a camp on the same lake as camp blood . Predictably the killings begin right where they left off in the first film...but by whom? This movie is directed by Steve Miner (Warlock, Halloween H2O and Lake Placid) and the cast includes Amy Steel (April Fool's Day), Kirsten Baker (Gas Pump Girls), John Furey (Tracker), Tom McBride (White Lies) and Marta Kober (Rad). This movie is perfectly executed in that it gets through the setup quickly and right into it the killings with a nice size body count to rack up the creative killings. The music score is also almost on par with the first film, the kill scenes are a notch better, but the storyline is a notch below the first movie. Overall, it packs a punch for slasher film fans and ties the first movie in very well. I'd score this installment in the series a 6.5/10.",Friday the 13th Part 2

72,drqshadow-reviews,"Tame, Shallow and Repetitive Compared to the Original",3,6 October 2016,"A rather base, derivative sequel to the effective (if ham-fisted) first Friday. It's less bloody but every bit as violent, with a comically ever-present Jason stalking through the shadows in almost every scene (no matter how distant), seeking hapless teenagers to string up for the vaguest of reasons. He's not quite the icon he'd grow into with later installments - no hockey mask, clunky coveralls, a tuft of long brown hair - but he does a fair job of mixing up the arsenal and he's usually bathed in shadows so we can give that a pass. There isn't much to root for in the bland cast of victims, which checks off stereotypes like a politically-correct Saturday morning cartoon. Even at an economical eighty-seven minutes, I felt like we were spending a bit too much time with these shallow, repetitive supporting characters. Special points for sending the wheelchair-bound counselor down a steep flight of stairs with a gaping head wound, though. Redundant and formulaic, rambling and aimless, it's a little too comfortable with aping the original where it could be seeking broader pastures.",Friday the 13th Part 2

I like this movie's closer connections with Part 1, like Alice's brief return, and the scary desiccated dead head of Mrs. Voorhies and how Jason has it on a creepy shrine, and old Crazy Ralph, who really must have been insane because he failed to predict his own doom this time around! It was great to see the late Betsy Palmer again, if only as an apparition in Jason's twisted mind. The opening prologue is so unnervingly eerie with Alice alone in the middle of the night and finding her worst fears realised as she finds an old friend hiding out in the fridge... I always hated when they'd kill off the surviving characters of previous movies like that, it makes their struggles feel so pointless. At least he had the good manners to take the kettle off the hot stove afterwards.. People complain about how Jason could have possibly located her, but maybe she was closer to Crystal Lake than we thought, she did say that she was trying to get over her trauma? I didn't feel much for the victims except for Amy Steel and the scrawny red-headed hobgoblin comedian because he was highly annoying, but at least he was something! I so dearly wanted to see him gruesomely get bumped off but surprisingly he never was. It's so random how he and a bunch of other nameless camper trainees just stay at the bar and out of the rest of the movie. I didn't like the Paul character because he was too much of a cocky douche and to me not particularly likable at all. And I hated the stupid little cutesy frou-frou dog with the ribbon in its hair named Muffin. The creature's only purpose was to turn up alive and well at the confusing end so you'll think everything's all sunshine and buttercups. I repeat: the dog's name was Muffin! I love Amy Steel as Ginny, she was really cool and beautiful and she was one of the best final girls in horror movies ever. She was a very different kind of heroine than Adrienne King was, a little more fly and tomboyish but she had a strong charisma about her, and she was a fighter who thought quick on her feet, she kicks Jason in the balls and briefly goes after him with a freaking chainsaw! I liked the way she was somewhat sympathetic to Jason and his mother and how she uses what she knows to her advantage at the end when she buys herself some time by putting on the filthy blue sweater of Jason's mother and fooling him into believing that she's her. I find that whole tense moment to be one of the all time great scenes of the Friday the 13th movies. The kills are decent but I don't think they're as gory or effective as the ones that Tom Savini put together for the first film. The best ones are when it first reveals the old dirty baghead version of Jason and it focuses on his hand in the foreground holding the knife as he closes in on the terrified girl who's too scared to even try and run... There's the killing of the couple humping in bed which brings a ghastly new meaning to the term ""double penetration!"" Then there's also the death of the handsome guy in the wheelchair which feels especially cruel and brutal just because he was a little more vulnerable than everybody else, and it was almost as if they had him in that chair to begin with just so that they could have the awesome shot of him tumbling down the long stairs with the machete still stuck in his head.. (It was so worth it!) I love the potato sack Jason, he looks so ridiculous, he's like an adorable little rabid hobo! He's a far cry from the great movie maniac he would become, as he's still alive and isn't all that hulking or super-strong or even that threatening, but he's not without a certain bit of that vital Jason stalkyness. And I can accept Jason's mysterious return as an adult, although his not drowning as a freakish child does devalue the original movie's impact and does technically mean that Mrs. Voorhees was killing for absolutely nothing.. But you know, jeez, we got the adult Jason that the generations of fans connected with in a major way and that kicked the series into high gear, moving on! I really wish that at the very end when it focuses on the head of Pamela Voorhees, which I find quite a chilling image, that they'd have gone ahead and had the head open its eyes and smile at the audience like they were planning to before some genius decided that it would've been silly.. But I think it would have made the ending even better and would have confirmed that something dark and supernatural was already at work with Jason and the Crystal Lake woods. An entertaining solid sequel and a good chapter in a great series. The grim fun in those deep dark spooky woods was only just beginning....",Friday the 13th Part 2

""Part 3"" is okay, but from there on the films start to go downhill one by one.The film starts off with Alice, the survivor of the first movie, getting knifed through the head at her house, and then it goes on to some camp counselors trying to fix up a summer camp not far from Crystal Lake. Everyone is enjoying it, having a good time like all those who have come to the camp before them. But then people start disappearing, and the body count begins to climb, and pretty rapidly I'd say.Steve Miner (who later directed ""Halloween II"" and ""Halloween H20""), does a good job here with the directing, setting a good mood throughout the film. The score is pretty much the same (ki ki ki ki ma ma ma ma). The acting is mediocre, but when I watch a ""Friday the 13th"" film I'm not looking for great acting, I'm looking for a good ol' slasher movie, which doesn't rely on good acting. The special effects are decent, the ending to the movie was really great, and the murder sequences that take place in Jason's little shack out in the woods were well plotted.The original ""Friday the 13th"" is by far the best of this series, you don't get any better than that.

I think the acting is better, and I think the execution is better and more entertaining. Betsy Palmer makes a small appearance and does well as Mrs Vorhees. The violence here is not that bad really, I liked the way it was done, it is not overly graphic or grotesque in any way. I also like how the sexual content was handled, also not too in your far or graphic. Amy Steele is good here, she is especially great in the scene where she pretends to be mrs Vorhees in order to distract Jason and escape. I loved that scene, and I thought it was clever, and usually clever/smart things do not happen in this genre of horror films lol. This movie also does have some interesting dialogue, like the bar scene for instance, where Amy Steele is talking about if Jason was real, and more than just an old legend, and has this interesting monologue about Jason and his connection with his mother. It's not like Oscar winning or cinema gold, but I thought that part was well written. I also found the characters likable here, which is sometimes hard in slagged films.

79,JoeKarlosi,Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981) **1/2,6,6 February 2013,"A worthy continuation in the series. A new group of camp counselors set up business in an area right next door to the old ""Camp Blood"" of Part One, where young misfit child Jason Voorhees had drowned in the '50s, and which was only recently plagued by a series of gruesome revenge killings. Now the adult and maniacal Jason, still alive and wearing a white, one-eyed sack over his head, hunts and slaughters the naive intruders. Director Steve Miner does a decent job at the controls, and injects some old-fashioned suspense into the festivities. Fan favorite Amy Steel is an asset to the new cast as the tough heroine who gets to confront Jason on his own turf. At the time this sequel was made, nobody knew what an icon Jason would ultimately become, so members of the original team opted out. This included absent makeup maestro Tom Savini, so the makeup effects here were competently done by Carl Fullerton. The best effect of Part II involves a machete embedded into a character's face. **1/2 out of ****",Friday the 13th Part 2

82,Witchfinder-General-666,Jason Celebrates his Murderous (But Quite Unspectacular) Debut,4,20 May 2009,"Warning: SPOILERS!!! (Not only of this film, but also of the predecessor, ""Friday The 13th"")Though I've never been a great fan of the ""Friday The 13th"" series I recently decided to watch the films again after several years. I never fully understood what made the ""Friday"" films so immensely popular among some of my fellow Horror fans, but I still admit that some of the films are very entertaining if one is in the right mood. This first sequel to the immensely popular (but, in my opinion, mediocre) original is the first film to introduce the iconic Jason Voorhees as the actual villain. And the fact that an iconic villain is introduced is actually the main reason to watch this film, which barely reaches mediocrity otherwise. The whole premise of this film, as well as the further sequels, contradicts the story of the original. Otherwise, the story could not have continued. In part one, the murderess Mrs. Voorhees was a mother gone insane after her son Jason's death. After she was (very visible) beheaded on screen in Part 1, she couldn't re-appear in the sequels, of course, which is why Jason 'resurrects' in the sequel. Gore-master Tom Savini, who was responsible for the special effects in the first part, refused to be part of the first sequel because he found the idea to be stupid. The villain who was resurrected for Part 2, however, turned out to become one of the most popular Horror villains ever.The plot of this first sequel is quite simple. After Mrs. Voorhees was beheaded in the end of part one, Jason begins by murdering the only survivor, Alice Hardy, who killed his mother. He then goes on a killing spree murdering annoying teens working at a holiday camp near the original Camp Crystal Lake... The second part may be just as influential as its predecessor, but, as far as I am concerned, it is only remotely entertaining, and not the least bit scary. The most interesting aspect of the first part were the killings, many of which were copied from the Italian genius Mario Bava's milestone ""Reazione A Catena"" aka. ""A Bay of Blood"" (1971), and the lakeside location, which was just as obviously inspired by the aforementioned classic (in my humble opinion, Bava was arguably THE greatest Horror director who ever lived). The same is (even more obviously) the case here. The killings in this sequel are a lot less explicit than in the first film, however. This may be both due to the lack of Tom Savini as the gore-guy, or to calm film censors after the first film was criticized for its violence- Especially the 'double impaling' sequence is very obviously inspired by ""A Bay of Blood"", but even more obviously tamed down.Jason does not yet wear his trademark Hockey-Mask in this one yet (The third part was the first one for him to appear in that outfit), but wears a bag to cover his face. The teenagers at the camp are entirely annoying, which lessens the suspense, but increases the impatience to see them killed. Overall, ""Friday the 13th"" should arguably be seen at least once for its cult-status, but, personally, I really don't think this cult-status is justified. The few rewarding moments in the film include: Mrs. Voorhees' severed head in a refrigerator. Mrs. Voorhees' severed head on a shrine built by Jason. Foxy young Kirsten Baker going skinny-dipping A guy in a wheelchair getting a machete hacked in his face.Otherwise, the film is only recommendable for its being somewhat of a classic. As far as I am concerned, this is a weak entry to a generally overrated series.",Friday the 13th Part 2
83,caspian1978,A Worthy Sequel,7,13 October 2004,"While most sequels cash in on their original movie's fame, the second part of the Friday the 13th series lives up to its name. Unlike the first movie, Jason stars in this movie while his ""mother"" has the cameo. The gore and the kill scenes surpass the original. The characters are true teenage stereotypes. Much like the ending in the original, the ending here is great. A jump out of your seat moment that lives up to the original. This is way before Jason wears his hockey mask. Here we are witnessed to a masked killer that uses a pillow case to hide his scary identity. From here on, the fame of PART 2 made it possible for the next bunch of films to happen. It is pretty much all down hill from here. While some of those films lived up to being great horror movies, most fell short and could not recycle the same effect that PART 2 had on its audience.",Friday the 13th Part 2
84,Jonny_Numb,possesses the same fast pace and manipulative shocks of the first film...,6,5 September 2003,"...which isn't such a bad thing.  Sure, character development is non-existent, but the characters are less obnoxious this time out (and the girl I was hoping would get naked DID get naked!).  Steve Miner (""Halloween: H20"") does a fairly good job building suspense through a minimalist approach, and keeps the film moving at a breakneck pace--something is always going on, even if it defies common logic (how could that overweight cop possibly keep up with Jason?  how could the male hero track the heroine to Jason's secluded cabin in the woods?).  The murders are deliciously nasty, yet lack the expert polish of Tom Savini's work in the first ""Friday the 13th.""  And yes, there are moments in this sequel that generate genuine shocks and scares, which is something practically unheard of in our latter-day, self-aware slasher flicks.  This isn't highbrow cinema, but it's a passable way to waste an evening.5/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
85,aidanratesmovies,Meh,5,24 June 2020,"An incredibly average, formulaic, cheesey, but moderately entertaining slasher flick- Friday the 13th Part 2 spends too much time referring back to the original than providing anything new to be excited with. The actors vary from okay, to incredibly cheesey, with Amy Steel providing the best performance in the film, as she makes the most of her often ridiculous banter. Once the film stops going back and forth, before the credit sequence, and refering back to what previously happened for nearly 5 minutes of its short runtime- the film begins to pick up a bit. It's characters are stale, and very steriotypical, not to mention horny, literally it feels like every character in the film is used as a prop or an excuse to have sex somewhere throughout the film. The film isn't very scary, but creepy in its tone and atmosphere, and though the shots and script are plenty obvious what is going to happen most of the time, it isn't a total bore to watch, more like a guilty pleasure fun flick for most. But for me, honestly, I have to say I wasn't too impressed or thrilled to experience the sequel to a film I only semi-enjoyed. It's often messy, but not all a bad time. It's just too average for its own good, and with everyone throughout the film relying so heavily on the uniqueness of the situation, you can't help but feel like there should be something more, or at least something better.My Rating: 4.5/10.",Friday the 13th Part 2
86,mrdonleone,no horror and only a bit of nudity,6,9 April 2009,"I am going to try to prove this sequel is not a good one, because it lacks creepy scenes and doesn't have much nudity.I came to a point in my life where I was thinking 'hey, maybe it would be great if I would see the entire Friday the 13th series all over again' and yes, it's true, very often opinions do change on different times. with this sort films it doesn't matter at all when you watch it: if you're into some horror, you will enjoy it, but if you're not, you will be disappointed.I remember very well the first time I saw this sequel, I was still very young. like all young kids, I was more interested in the nudity and shocking gore of this movie. on both levels I wasn't very pleased: the few nude scenes are only enjoyable with a DVD player (which I hadn't at the time) with a zoom function and the shocking gore scenes, well... there aren't.yes, you read it right: there are totally no shocking gore scenes! this was (and still is very) strange, because on the end of the original Friday the 13th, we discover 'poor' Jason is a scary monster with lots of blood on his body (propably from lying too long and too much in the water of the lake). I was forgotten this. but where is the blood? where are his mutilations? In the original, we see a hugely deformed body, in this sequel, we see Jason as a normal man with only a weird formed face (with a paper bag on it - how could he see a thing?). yes, it was a big disappointment.but hey, it's still creepy. the end, however, is worthless. it's a stupid ending. I was hoping to see Jason killed, but he just survives. not only that, but we don't see the final battle. not only that, but if everybody except a guy and a girl are dead, and we find out the guy has been killed and Jason is disappeared again, than why didn't he kill the 'dangerous' girl too? this first sequel was a disappointment.",Friday the 13th Part 2
87,Samiam3,"A little better, a little worse, still good",7,8 June 2009,"To be honest, Part II is pretty much the same as part I. Too frequently does this sequel from first time director Steve Miner directly resemble its predecessor. The plot, the setting, the character types, the music, and even some of the shots are virtually identical. Do not however let these faults discourage you from seeing this movie. Just as it was promised by the first (and is pretty much expected by the viewers), we get to meet Jason Voorhees, although he has yet to get some proper facial wear. He wears a Ku Klux Klan hood instead of the hockey mask, but the effect works the same. As for the horror, I was a little disappointed but not terribly. Instead of solid suspense, Part II resorts to a lot of cheap and predictable shocks (including the famous jumping cat)What I found most interesting about Part II is the way in which the viewer feels a little empathy for Jason. Considering he was left to drown by his counselors, witnessed the decapitation of his mother by one of them, and considering he has nowhere to go in the world, One cannot blame him for wanting to kill the people who run camps on Crystal Lake. (to put it one way, they make him feel uncomfortable). I guess this is a bit of a bias on my part, but I'm sure many would agree with me that Jason is more interesting than another cast of cardboard cut outs to be picked off one by one. As a protagonist, Amy Steel is a little less painful to watch than Adrienne King, because her delivery is much better, but she is still pretty much the same character; a heroine who must survive by running as fast as she can (or something like that).In the end, Part II is more of the same, but somehow it entertains. A fairly good job.",Friday the 13th Part 2
88,ctomvelu1,Old One-Eye,7,27 October 2009,"I always found Part 2 the creepiest in this long-running series. Jason the child has not drowned, but grown up to be a very demented killer living deep in the woods, his mother's heed given a place of prominence in his shack. He wears a sack over his head in this one, making him resemble the Elephant Man, only with a machete in hand. Campers are returning to Crystal Lake, and Jason doesn't like having neighbors. The hockey mask will come later, of course. One of the best, if not the best, in the series. I always thought the actor playing Jason in this one was a match for Kane Hodder's immortal Jason. And Part 2 is now being remade for a 2010 release.",Friday the 13th Part 2
89,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"The story continues,....without some its good parts from the original",5,19 August 2014,"Even though Friday the 13th (1980) was not the most original of ideas, it still maintained a level of entertainment that came as a surprise, considering that it took the main premise from Halloween (1978). Although the style was also parallel, the story was different which helped it stand out from other horror films at the time. Jason Vorhees - who would've known that would become a common name? Of course this wasn't revealed until close to the ending of the first film. Plus, by the ending viewers were introduced to a melancholy ending about where the remains of Mr.Vorhees were. It wasn't the fullest of closure but it did end the tragic story rather well. Apparently Paramount felt that wasn't enough closure.What Part II decides to do is bring the story full circle. This idea is successful in some respects, while at other times the execution leaves more questions instead of answering them. One of the best parts about this sequel is its continuity. If there's one thing a sequel should get right, it's sticking to the story it originally told. It has got to and thankfully the filmmakers accomplished that. This is accomplished by showing and explaining to its audience what happened to the girl from the original. Then, the story sets itself up with a new cast of camp counselors. Unfortunately this is where things began to head south. For one, the characters are flat. There is barely a character that makes themselves feel any different from the last bunch of counselors fans viewed from the first film.Along with that are individual story lines to these characters that go unfinished. Unlike the first entry, which ended with a decent amount of closure (with a few loose ends), this entry misses even more, with absent explanations on a few of the main characters. Ron Kurz writing is very uneven. He keeps continuity but forgets to keep this work in line. As Steve Miner's debut, his direction is fairly predictable sadly on a lot of cases. Much of the execution relies on copying its predecessor with no creativity or uniqueness this time. Not even its cinematography by Peter Stein grabs the attention. Stein likes to keep his cameras hidden in the brush so that its impossible to get a feeling for all the surroundings. There isn't much to be see this time.Besides continuity being one of its strong points, the violence, background concept and music are commendable. Although the gore has been edited quicker, the bloodshed is still heavy and gruesome. The background concept to what happened to Jason and being expanded upon is interesting. It dilutes Jason's motivations a bit and lacks clarity but it still is an eye grabber. Music was again produced by composer Harry Manfredini. For the most part, Manfredini keeps everything the same. Still screeching strings and whispering ghostly voices. It is nice keeping the signature feeling but incorporating some tunes would've been better. It's not a terrible entry but it could've had the bumps smoothed out.The sequel manages to keep clear continuity with its parent yet fails to clear up anything for the current entry. With a cast resembling a carbon copy of its first set of characters, the execution feels too similar except for a few parts like its violence and background concepts.",Friday the 13th Part 2
90,raulfaust,Give me a break,2,15 October 2011,"I am really shocked-- of how bad this film is. It begins much like the first one, but is far from decent.

92,PredragReviews,"It's Friday 13th again, why are you all going there!!!",7,4 May 2016,"Although no where near as good as its predecessor this is still a fine easy to enjoy slasher horror. Starting with a long flashback to the 1st film (10mins before we even see the opening credits) and culmination of Alice, we then move onto the new set of young councilors at the (very convenient) next door camp and the killings begin again. The actually awkward crow-barring in of Jason (we get no reason why he's still alive, has he just been hiding away for 20-odd years) comes over fairly seamlessly in actual fact. The rest of the story is basically a standard slasher, stalker plot, however the film is very suspenseful at times and there are some very good shock/jump sequences, particularly the opening 10 mins with Alice form the previous film and the climax is a very aspect of the picture and then tension is heightened throughout it. Pacing is great, performances are surprisingly decent and the director Miner keeps everything moving along very well, gore scenes aren't as good as Friday 1 but certainly don't detract from anything in the main picture.The plot is not quite as good, but this is the film where we really see Jason get to work and establish the identity of the franchise. The 1980 original, for all its merits, was not always clever enough about hiding its debts to ""Psycho"" and ""Halloween"". For much of the film Jason (or often Jason's shoes and legs!) has real threatening presence, only late on does he occasionally turn a little goofy, perhaps a sad precursor of how the film was to eventually lose its way. When he reveals his deformed face, this is done no favors by HD, and it is clear that the deaths are both tamer and less well done by the FX standards of the recent ""Friday the 13th"" film from Marcus Nispel. But none of this should detract from a film that has spawned imitations and cultural quotations far and wide.Overall, there are some legitimately great moments in Friday the 13th part 2. The whole climax and all through to the finale is very well done. There is also a midway scene where a police officer gets a brief glance of Jason running across the street and into the woods. The policeman follows him into the shack we see at the end of the film and gets a hammer thrown into his head. That scene really stands out for me. I'm not sure it was intended to be as eerie as it is, but the brief cut of Jason running into the woods is definitely well handled and convincing.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Friday the 13th Part 2

Quebec Rating:18+(should be 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating:R(Should be 18A)Friday The 13th Part 2 is the first sequel to the Friday the 13th horror franchise.This film is the start of at least nine sequels for this series.In the first film which I have not seen, it was Jason's mother getting revenge for her son drowning.In this film however, we meet Jason who will be the main antagonist for the rest of the series.He wants revenge on camp counselors for letting him drown back in 1958.This film and Jason X are the only films in the Friday The 13th series I have seen.I also saw Freddy Vs Jason which I thought was very entertaining and good.I have seen all the NIghtmare On Elm Street films and loved all of them.I prefer Freddy as an antagonist rather than Jason.Freddy was very evil in the first film and in the other films he has plenty of funny one-liners.Jason however does not speak.The film starts off with a recap of the events of the first Friday the 13th film.Then we see that the woman who survived in the first film has been killed by an unknown person.We then see a bunch of camp counselors in training.They are all basically having fun and everything until one by one, they each start getting murdered.So what follows, like in most slasher films, they all try and stop Jason before they all get killed themselves.Now as I said in previous reviews on this site, I usually like slasher films.The original nightmare on elm street is one of my favorite horror films.This movie however just didn't do it for me.I mean the score was pretty good and there were some cool death scenes but I found the film to be a little too short and fairly boring for a slasher film.I thought the film was decent and its worth checking out for slasher film fans.Also, in this film, Jason does not wear the hockey mask he is known for wearing but rather a bag with holes for eyes.",Friday the 13th Part 2
94,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Great flick marred only by a lame ending,9,3 April 2012,"In this, my favourite in this now lengthy series, the sole survivor from the first film, still traumatised and suffering nightmares after the events of the first film, unaware that an unknown figure lies lurking in the darkness outside her house. In such a lengthy pretitle sequence, the film tricks us into thinking that she will be the focus of this film, before pulling the rug out from underneath the viewers' feet and brutally killing off her character 20 minutes into the film. The real heroine is not introduced until about 30 minutes into the film, when we are taken back to the shores of Crystal Lake, where another group of people are attempting to open another summer camp on the opposite shores of the lake, five years after the events of the first film. A lull in action while we're introduced to the current group of victims-to-be is quickly forgotten when the carnage begins again. But who is to blame this time? Jason's mother again? Or did the little goofball grow up and follow in his demented mother's footsteps? Its unusual structure is uneven: it has a 20-minutes long pretitle sequence; followed by a joke sequence involving a two truck; but then a lengthy lull in action while we're introduced to the characters, before kicking back into gear for the second half- but then a letdown with a pointless, nonsensical ending (jumping through a window, possibly stolen from Phantasm?) marring an otherwise great horror flick. The film should have ended just as Ginny and Paul walked out of the shack Jason lived in.But the good outweighs the bad in this film, and I think it manages to top the first film. The writers tried to get a bit psychological here, with the heroine hypothesizing about what made Jason's mother kill, and what Jason would be like if he had lived- it was an interesting twist. The seemingly higher budget also helps, as does better photography, and more attempts at suspense in between the bloodletting. The characters are not as obnoxious as in a lot of other slashers, which is also works in the film's favour. My favourite scene has a boneheaded cop chasing Jason into the woods, and stumbling onto, and into, Jason's ""house"".",Friday the 13th Part 2

(Though tragically without his hockey-mask in this entry...) Much like the original, the film was a low-budget feature that proved to be a financial hit, solidifying the franchise as one that was bound to stick around.Some time after the original film, a new group of counselors at Camp Crystal Lake are stalked by the silent, hulking killer Jason Voorhees- somehow back from the dead after his mother's beheading in part one. And as the bodies begin to pile and the stakes begin to rise, it all builds to a shocking climax.I do think this is where the series started to really pick up steam. I had my issue aplenty with the first film (which I discussed in my previous review), but I do think a lot of my problems were rectified in this follow-up. And I really do think director Steve Miner is the main driving force to thank for that.Miner is someone I am a most definitely a fan of. In addition to directing two entries in this franchise, he also helmed the highly entertaining and underrated horror-comedy ""Lake Placid"" and ""Halloween H20""- which is arguably the best sequel in the ""Halloween"" franchise. While I don't want to trash talk series creator Sean S. Cunningham, I do feel that Miner is a much more confident visual storyteller, and has a much better grasp on composition and pacing. This sequel is just a wholly more competent production than the original and the direction is a massive part of that.I also feel that writers Ron Kurz and Phil Scuderi deliver a more refined story this time around, and are able to build up a better group of central characters who are easily and quickly defined. While they may never move into any real realm of complexity, everyone at least has a personality here and you do on occasion find yourself actually fearing for some of the cannon-fodder, erm, I mean ""victims.""There's also some creative kills to tide over the gore-hounds, some nice ""naughty scenes"" for the pervs in the audience, a few funny moments and a much brisker pace to boot. All in all, the entertainment factor is just ramped up so much here that it's a ton of fun to watch. Especially with some friends and perhaps a few beers.That being said, it's still a pretty shallow affair, and I'd be lying if I said it was technically a ""good movie."" It gets much closer to what the franchise would eventually evolve into during its best outtings but it doesn't quite reach that level, so I do have to dock a few points for that.But in the end, it's an improvement over the first without any doubt and is definitely worth checking out for slasher fans.I'm giving it a slightly above average 6 out of 10.

Heres the problem with that he's fully grown, he somehow knows where she lives and travels to her house. Cut to 5 years later and a group of counselors are trying to open up a camp and start being stalking and slashed by a hooded Jason.

The killings / gore are pretty good, too. Somehow, the whole cast appealed to me slightly less than those in the first part, but certainly Ginny makes for a worthy opponent of... Jason. Yes, Jason... I found the given of him having survived in the woods alone all those years a bit of a stretch.

By now, we know the killer is Jason Voorhees, who then proceeds to hack away at a new batch of dope-smoking, oversexed teen campers who show up ""five years"" after the events in the original. Jason kills with a machete to the face, butcher knife and barbed wire, slashes a couple of throats and sends a spear through a lovemaking couple courtesy Mario Bava's BAY OF BLOOD. Betsy Palmer is seen in flashback footage from the first movie and in a few seconds of new footage. Carl Fullerton did the fine make-up FX, much of which had to be cut for an R rating.",Friday the 13th Part 2
99,Pumpkin_Man,"You've Met Mother, Now Meet Her Son!!!",10,16 May 2016,"I like this one pretty well because it introduces us to adult Jason Voorhees for the first time (But he doesn't have his infamous hockey mask just yet. He's basically a hillbilly living in a crappy shack and wears a burlap sack to cover his face.) This one has some pretty interesting kills like a double penetration with a spear through the chest and a machete to the face for a handicapped man. The film takes place five years after the original. A man named Paul hosts a camp-counselor training camp at a building near Crystal Lake. Paul's love interest is Ginny, one of the girls who gives Jason a pretty decent fight. Among the rest of the group are lovers Jeff and Sandra, who want to see Camp Crystal Lake for themselves. Sweet Vickie who is in love with wheelchair bound Mark. Ted, the jokester, and Scott & Terry.

Lets see, Olivia-Newton-John lookalike? CHECK! 80's dweeb? CHECK! Wheelchair guy? CHECK! It goes on and on. The pacing of this sure ...(read more)was strange. After a refresher course of what happens in the fist movie, the first people killed are, no, not the new campers, but OLD PEOPLE STILL AROUND FROM THE FIRST MOVIE! ha ha. It's not until maybe half an hour in (maybe longer) until we start saying goodbye to the new cast members. I was surprised at how MANY counselours there were, and I was like, no way, they're not going to off them ALL are they? And true enough, they DON'T. That's sort of a cheat..

101,TheUnknown837-1,"""Friday the 13th Part 2"" is appropriately titled, since it is quite literally more of the same",4,8 November 2011,"""Friday the 13th Part 2"" is appropriately titled, since it is, in more ways that one, a continuation of the surprisingly successful and still-popular 1980 film directed by Sean S. Cunningham. And depending on one's idiosyncratic tastes and aesthetics, that will be either a good thing or a bad thing when watching ""Part 2."" And it is my sad duty to report that I stand with the latter.Because ""Part 2"" is really more of what we got the first time around: alarming dehumanization (especially toward the female half of the human race), poorly-staged acts of gory violence, shoddy performances, and (for me) absolute boredom, mixed with bursts of anger, from beginning to end. As it opens, it is right after the final events of the first one. The sole surviving counselor from the first movie (Adrienne King) is trying to cope away from home, and her parents, when she gets the creepy sensation that she is not alone (in the house, cabin, motel? I'm really not sure what it was). The camera lingers on her in a Hitchcockian way and just when she feels safe, a figure grabs her and shoves a blade to the hilt in her skull.And then we know that it was perhaps the believed-drowned boy Jason Voorhees did not die after all, saw his mother get beheaded, came back for revenge, and is, I guess to carry on his mother's name, cut the throats of anybody who comes back to where they thought he had died and where she *did* die.Cut to our new cast of characters as they head back to Crystal Lake, the 'haunted' summer camp where throats and faces were slit the time before. From there, it's just more of the same. Would-be drives of suspense in the first act along with angering scenes of sex and drug-doing between the teens, some random killings in the second, and lots of close calls utterly devoid of excitement in the third right up till another open-window of an ending, leaving plenty of room for Part III and the many others that followed.The acting is amateurish, but then again I cannot imagine the actors had much fun being slapped around, covered with cartoonishly-lit fake blood, splattered with mud, undressed, and photographed in lewd manners so that the audience may take some joy in seeing them slaughtered. The only big difference the second time around is a decrease in directing quality. The work of Sean S. Cunningham was home-videoish in the first one, but the shots and flow of images by Steve Miner is another step down.Unquestionably, there is an audience for the ""Friday the 13th"" movies. They would not have made an entire franchise for the heck of it. Like the Japanese monster movies, which also have an appeal for a certain cult and little for the rest of the world, you either admire the aesthetics for what they are, or do not for the same reason. I personally do not.",Friday the 13th Part 2
102,baumer,"Introducing Jason Voorhees, ruthless killer",9,13 August 1999,"May contain some spoilers:Who would have known that the Friday's would spawn 8 sequels?  It is a testament to not only their immense popularity with the teenage crowd but to how you can make a horror film with a small budget.  While the Friday's aren't anywhere on par with Halloween and the first Nightmare, the first 4 were scary and atmospheric.  Here, Steve Miner has directed a scary tense film, especially the opening ten mintues and the final 20 minutes.  In between is a good film but the moments mentioned above really are what true horror is all about.  And what is memorable of this installment of Friday the 13th is that it introduces the horror world to the killer Jason Voorhees.This picks up a short time after the first one ended.  And it starts off in the city where the survivor of the first one is home and resting and trying to put her memories to rest.  Needless to say that she doesn't last too long in the film.  And then we get to the parts that we want to see.  A bunch of counselors at Camp Crystal Lake.  They are basically lined up to be slaughtered and all that's left to do is to try to figure out who is going to go and who isn't.What is so great about this one is that it pays attention to some of the elements that made Halloween so scary.  There is a lot of gore in here but it is background for the suspence.  There is one scene near the end where Ginny knows someone is in the dark room with her and Paul.  She doesn't know why she knows, she just does.  And then Jason strikes and we all jump.  It is a perfect scene and it deserves mention because it is a technique that early 80's horror films were good at and one that 90's films aren't.  The film also has great false scares and when Ginny is in the cabin in the woods and she comes face to face with a ?ghost? and what she has to do to survive, well it is one of the best scares in all the Friday series.  And that is because it uses so much tension, so much anticipation, so much intelligence. We know Ginny is in danger and we are hoping that she gets out of here alive.  It is really a great scene.Friday 2 is a good horror flick.  It has all that you could hope for in a scary movie.  If you want to remember what it was like when you were a kid and watched these movies in the dark, my advice to you is to do it again. Get your barbecue chips and Coke and turn off all the lights, get your girlfriend, wife, fiancee or dog and sit back and enjoy a great 80's horror movie.  This is one of the better ones out there.",Friday the 13th Part 2
103,gedikreverdi,Jason in his sack mask,5,24 August 2021,"I feel kind of bad when I can't love a classic horror film like most people do as most of them watched them decades ago than I do. The first ten minutes is simply a rehash and recap of the first film. Then young people drinking and having sex. The killings were instantaneous and a lot less gory. We don't know how the final girl survived and how her boyfriend Paul came to save her after Jason killed her (we didn't see him getting away or anything). Jason was living in a makeshift cabin in the woods where he made an altar with the head of Mrs. Voorhees and I liked the first one solely because of her, her acting and everything about her. I liked how Jason used different tools to kill although they were off the camera and his altar at the cabin and his sack mask with one hole on it. What I like about this film most is the opening scene where Alice the final girl of the first film gets killed. And where is Jason's hockey mask already?",Friday the 13th Part 2

The acting is better, the direction is better (by Steve Miner, who made ""Halloween H20""), the characterizations are better and the death scenes are more fun to watch.  Plus, there's more nudity.But all in all ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" is forgettable slasher entertainment.  I still wasn't locked in and still felt it was pretty dull.

106,hnt_dnl,Overrated sequel,2,25 October 2021,"An opinion that seems to be gaining traction over the years is that FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2 (1981) is one of the best sequels and maybe even better than the original, but I honestly don't get it. The first movie has a charm, originality and re-watchability that I just don't see in this first sequel. First, Part 2 has way too many camp counselors! The first movie kept it to a reasonable minimum of about 7 counselors, while Part 2 doubles down and has as many as 14 or 15. That doesn't give much time to develop anyone and really spreads the dialogue thin. The characters in the first movie had this energy and likability that the ones in this one completely lacked. Second, the characters who did get significant dialogue and screen time in this movie were all interchangeably bland. The 2 blonde leads playing the main counselors Paul and Jenny were terrible and had no chemistry, delivery their dialogue in the most annoying monotone. And none of the dialogue worked. There was something natural about the dialogue in the first movie, but in Part 2, characters would tell unfunny jokes that didn't land either on or off screen.The original Friday the 13th had a great setup with the lone camp counselor girl hitchhiking her way to Camp Crystal Lake and methodically meeting a different odd local or crazy along the way until she met her untimely demise by the film's mystery killer. The movie deftly set up that the rest of the counselors were in mortal danger and there was a good pacing to the kills. This sequel just introduces a ton of characters and kills most of them off within like 10 minutes, so there's a lot of filler in this movie of boring characters being boring. The final girl Jenny didn't actually do much in this movie or get any kind of real development. She basically lucked out because she was at a bar along with the other disposable counselors while her peers were getting slaughtered. She also gave this way too self-aware speech about Jason when there's no way she could have known he was at the camp killing her friends. Her final ""Mommy"" speech to Jason was ludicrous. There's no way that should have worked. I would even say Paul was more of the lead than she was.I suspect that the group of fans who look down on the original movie and give more props to this one because it wasn't actually Jason doing the killing and he didn't start until this movie. But it shouldn't be about WHO is doing the killing as much as which is truly the better story and Part 2 barely has any story. Also, very famously, not only was Jason not the killer in Part 1, but also he didn't even have his notorious hockey mask here in Part 2 yet. He wore a sack over his head AND overalls. Hardly the intimidating Jason that came to be in the later sequels. The hockey mask didn't come until Part 3. And for anyone who thinks that the ending to Part 1 doesn't make sense, take a gander at the Part 2 ending! Lol Jenny somehow gets that jump scare attack by Jason through the window, cut to her being put in an ambulance and Paul nowhere to be found. Did Paul save Jenny from Jason and second time giving his life in the process? And what happened to Jason? Did the authorities just not care?Another thing that this movie has that the first movie really didn't is gratuitous sex and nudity. When they did it in Part 1, it felt more part of the plot, like the strip poker game. This is similar to how the first Saw was a psychological horror movie while Saw 2 initiated the torture porn aspect into the series with as much gore as possible. Aside from the 10-minute kill sequence (which was nothing special) and the final chase, there's not much to this movie but a bunch of interchangeable 1-dimensional teen characters doing a whole bunch of nothing.",Friday the 13th Part 2
107,Fernando-Rodrigues,What happened to Paul??,6,25 January 2021,"Median and simple, but entertaining. I think Jason's character would work more if he wasn't so ""human"" in this movie.

108,ODDBear,Here comes Jason...,5,18 September 2005,"This second installment in the Friday the 13th saga is quite good. It's all amateur night in terms of acting and writing, of course, but director Steve Miner keeps viewers interested for the most part. Granted, it's middle section is nearly totally worthless, absolutely nothing happens. These fill up scenes aren't all that good but things get interesting once Jason finally shows up and carnage begins.The kill scenes are pretty good, no Savini here but they're good all the same. Some are total rip offs (like say...Twitch of the death Nerve) but others quite inventive (wheelchair guy...ouchh). And Miner actually manages to build some suspense and shocks from this ohh so simple premise.It's not as good as the first one and some sequels are superior (parts 4 and 6 leap to mind) but if you're a fan, such as myself, it's well worth watching.I'll give 5 out of 10.

Friday The 13th Part 2 works about the same as # 1, however the tension of the finale is lost in what becomes mainly a slaughter house of teens killed one by one. There is no real plot and indeed this entry does feature the most survivors mainly due to the wisdom of a couple kids staying in town. However the shock ending in this one is easy to see coming and it's interesting to note that the killer in this film wears a pillow sack over his head. It's all fairly goofy although the movie does open well with legit suspense.

110,Mister-6,Slap-dash slasher....,1,15 August 1999,"Hmmm, where to begin.  About the most interesting thing about this movie is the fact that Jason aged so quickly since we last saw him jumping out of the lake in the original ""Friday the 13th"".  In ""Friday the 13th, Part 2"", he must have aged at least 20 years or so, but it must have been only a year or so later, since the surviving heroine from the original hasn't aged at all.Other than that, there are just more teenagers, more sharp objects, more deaths, more acting...HA!

111,TOMASBBloodhound,As good as any film in the series.,8,20 April 2005,"If you've never seen this film, or it's been a while since you've seen it, then do yourself a favor and check it out. This is the film that really put the name ""Jason Voorhees"" on the map. It seems that another camp has opened on Crystal Lake a few years after the original takes place. Now Jason is fully grown, and out to get some revenge for his dead mother! A young Steve Miner was handed the reins for this one and part 3, and he did a very respectable job. With only about a million dollars to use, he created a frightening and more than profitable film which set the table for many more down the road. Since it cost so little to make the earlier films in this series, it just goes to figure that ANY public demand for sequels was bound to create one after the next.Part 2 is somewhat less gory than others in the series. One particularly graphic death was trimmed way down to avoid the X-rating which would have spelled death at the box office. There are some other graphic deaths to make it worth your time, however. One unlucky cop gets the back of a hammer through his cranium. Another man is hung from his feet and his throat slashed. A poor guy in a wheelchair gets a machete in the face, then rolls down a long flight of stairs. Overall, there are still enough killings to keep your interest.The suspense is the strongest aspect of this film. Jason is a smaller and quicker adversary in this film than in the others. The guy they cast for him originally auditioned for John Furey's role, so he wasn't some gigantic beast like Ted White or Richard Brooker. The last fifteen minutes when Jason pursues Amy Steel around the camp are incredibly scary. The moment when Jason comes crashing through the window at the end is perhaps the biggest single scare in the series. And maybe I'm in the minority here, but I think Jason with the gunny sack over his head may have been scarier than with the hockey mask. With the sack, you have absolutely no idea what he looks like under there until we see him unmasked. And what a sight that is!! This is a very good horror film. Do yourself a favor and take another look at it.8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Friday the 13th Part 2

The survivor of the first film is driven crazy by her dreams and thoughts that she will be killed next by Jason or his equally psychopath mother.The setting is the summer of 1984, and yet, a new set of counselors reopen Camp Crystal Lake now, hoping to generate business based on the legend of Jason Voorhees. ""Part 2"" is actually the first part of a continuance sequence of events that ends in ""The Final Chapter"", when Jason starts his rampage of murder. After seeing his mother decapitated, he loses his mind, and murders the campers in his own right. Of course, he is tamed (for a brief moment) by the thought that his mother may be alive. Only to find out that it was a camper that put her shirt on.""Part 2"" is somewhat better than the original, but it is not the last good ""Friday the 13th"" movie.

I am a big fan of the actress and I love her to death in Friday the 13th Part 2. This movie is my number 4 favorite slasher Friday the 13th film in the series and I love Amy Steel so damn much as Ginny Field! She was the best heroine in the slasher films in my opinion. I love this film to death and I enjoy it and love it the same as the first one I love the atmosphere in the film. It has the best kills in the series. Characters are fairly well-developed and likable, at least for this franchise, and there are plenty of thrills. One of the most memorable final shocks rounds everything out.It is Jason Voorhees first outing as the murderer and the image of him wearing the potato sack over his head is burned into my retinas as one of the most memorable in the franchise.Amy Steel is a brilliant addition to the cast, a great heroine I love her to death in ""Friday The 13th part 2"" and I also love her in April Fool's Day she was excellent in those two films. She is always my favorite lead and I really enjoy Friday the 13th Part 2 more then the first one.Friday the 13th Part 2 is a great sequel great horror slasher movie that made Jason Voorhees memorial cool horror icon.This time the film was directed and produced by Steve Miner who I thought did an excellent job directing the film. This time for the special makeup effects was Carl Fullerton who did the right job like Tom Savini did with the first one.I love how Amy Steel defend her self against Jason Voorhees who was this time played by actor Steve Daskawisz with a potato sack. Amy Steel used chain saw on Jason that scene was copied by Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning and was also used and copied in Maniac Cop 2 I just didn't like it. Watch the climatic fight between Jason and Ginny in which Ginny imitates Jason's mom Pamela (Betsy Palmer) and then she swings with a machete towards Jason and Jason raises the mattock to block Ginny's machete swing this was an epic Climatic fight in the movie.Ginny Field with working tool fork in the hands is just memorial all over Amy Steel's picture we see her on IMDb and every where.Mrs. Voorhees is dead, and Camp Crystal Lake is shut down, but a camp next to the infamous place is stalked by an unknown assailant.Adrienne King and Walt Gorney did return that was a surprise for me and the were the first characters to die in the beginning of the film.Adrienne King wanted to reprise her role as Alice, but she said that she wanted to be on screen for a short period of time because there was an obsessive fan who was stalking her, broke into her apartment, and she feared for her life. So I respect the actress and her decision since this film she never return on TV screen but she lend her voice to animation movies. Adrienne King filmed all of her scenes in two days then she run faster as she could.Amy Steel has stated that she found shooting the ""window scene"" difficult. The shot required three takes and her frightened reaction is genuine. Because the shot was in slow-motion, a high-speed camera was used, and every time she heard the film start running, she would tense up and get scared. Amy was very upset with the director for the window scene and it was really annoyed cause director keep shouting they have to repeat the scenes.Great horror slasher suspense entertaining 80's movie my all time favorite horror film I still going to watch it. I watched this film 7 years ago when I was a big fan of Supernatural and I heard Jared Padalecki auditioned for his lead role in Friday the 13th reboot and I was curious so I went watching this film alongside with the first original film and Jason X before I watched reboot that was my fourth film I saw.I remember seeing this movie on DVD in the video store when I was in high school. I wasn't interesting seen it that time but today I am glad I have this film on Blu-ray, just got it this Thursday all 11th films and I watch it in Friday 22th this is the 3d time in the row I saw this film and i still will.This is one in my top 5 favorite Friday the 13th films it is my number four favorite slasher Friday the 13th movie and it is the best one. The movie it self's get's my Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval 10/10 Amy Steel is the queen of screamers and she is way better then Jamie Lee Curtis in my opinion.",Friday the 13th Part 2
115,eminkl,"Redundant and formulaic, rambling and aimless",3,18 April 2020,"A rather base, derivative sequel to the effective (if ham-fisted) first Friday. It's less bloody but every bit as violent, with a comically ever-present Jason stalking through the shadows in almost every scene (no matter how distant), seeking hapless teenagers to string up for the vaguest of reasons. He's not quite the icon he'd grow into with later installments - no hockey mask, clunky coveralls, a tuft of long brown hair - but he does a fair job of mixing up the arsenal and he's usually bathed in shadows so we can give that a pass. There isn't much to root for in the bland cast of victims, which checks off stereotypes like a politically-correct Saturday morning cartoon. Even at an economical eighty-seven minutes, I felt like we were spending a bit too much time with these shallow, repetitive supporting characters. Special points for sending the wheelchair-bound counselor down a steep flight of stairs with a gaping head wound, though. Redundant and formulaic, rambling and aimless, it's a little too comfortable with aping the original where it could be seeking broader pastures.",Friday the 13th Part 2
116,fernandoschiavi,"Despite the shallow characters and clichés, Part 2 comes almost like a remake of the original, but with some refinements",6,6 September 2021,"Released just a year after the original Friday the 13th, ""Part 2"" was the first film to feature Jason Voorhess as the bloodthirsty killer who would eventually win millions of fans over the years, but here he still hadn't used his famous hockey mask. In the original, it was his mother who was responsible for the killing. The series took off in quantity from then on: almost every year of that decade saw a Friday the 13th being released. The movies never gained respect in terms of quality, but most of Friday the 13th was always good enough for slasher movie fans, and this second chapter is no different: there are some very interesting scenes and a very tense atmosphere. This second part brought some interesting points that differentiate it from the sequels that would come later. First, here's a script that tries and manages to function as a Part 2 primarily by bringing back three characters from the previous movie. Furthermore, the script is interesting, well-crafted and with an efficient conclusion. And most importantly, here's Jason's debut, who in the original movie was just a memory seen in a few scenes.The beginning of Friday the 13th - Part 2 is one of the most interesting of the entire franchise. Here we meet Alice Hardy (Adrienne King), who survived the massacre in the original film. Five months after the first movie, Alice is in a house located near Crystal Lake. Still scared, the girl is trying to reorganize her life. Outside the house, a man is lurking. Here is one of the first surprises in the script. Early in the projection, Alice is killed. This is Jason's movie debut as an assassin. And no one better to be his first victim than Alice, who killed his mother in the previous movie. As a curiosity, this is one of the biggest intro scenes before the opening credits in the entire history of cinema, with approximately 15 minutes in length. The opening act, probably the best of this second chapter, closes the story of the original film in a single sequence, practically in real time, full of good suspense and some clichés that had already occurred in the original film and would occur in all sequences (false scares, atmosphere of growing terror, etc.). This scene takes place far from Crystal Lake and brings a tone quite different from anything seen in the previous film. Early on, the franchise gets rid of Alice by introducing us to Jason Voorhees, son of the original's assassin, and who sets out to seek revenge for his mother's death. Your next target? The new batch of teenagers who stupidly insist on vacationing at Camp Crystal Lake.After this prologue, the movie really starts. Five years after the slaughter shown in the first film, businessman Paul Holt (John Furey) decides to open a summer camp very close to where Camp Blood was located, in Crystal Lake. He hires some young people to be monitors at the camp - which is already ready to receive the children, unlike the scenario shown in the first film in the series, which was still undergoing renovations. Among the new monitors, a highlight is Ginny Field (Amy Steel, from The Night of the Deadly Games).The plot then follows the line from the beginning of the original with the monitors arriving at the camp and until an appearance of old Ralph (Walt Gorney), who was also the first movie warning young people to leave that place. Jason then takes action and kills part of the cast. However, an interesting curiosity of the script is that not everyone dies here. There is a group that will spend the night in the city and escape the killing promoted by Jason. By the way, another highlight of the plot is exactly how Mrs. Voorhees' son is shown. Here we have a lean, lithe Jason (running all the time) who wears a bag covering his face and one eye. The mask would only come in the next movie, from 1982.From the premise, we can already see that it is the very same movie we saw the first time, but exchanging the mother for the child. Ron Kurz's script doesn't venture to explore new areas or concepts, sticking exactly to the structure of the original, and while that's terrible for the reason that it makes the experience somewhat boring and predictable, it's necessary for the franchise to slowly find its way. That's because, before Part 2 was made official, the producers even considered Friday the 13th to be an anthology film series, where with each new movie we would be introduced to a different slasher story with different characters. In a way, that's sort of where the franchise ends up going, as Jason Voorhees' character insists on coming back from the dead over and over again, and the events of each movie don't seem to have much connection to each other - after all, Alice is dead right in the first scene, and this event has no repercussions in the rest of the narrative.Unfortunately, that means introducing us to new characters, but none of them are interesting enough for the audience to care about. Kurz's script is exceptional in bringing absolutely nothing new to the teen lead group, who make up yet another camp team that prepares Crystal Lake for the arrival of future members. Final girl of the time, Amy Steel does well at screaming and even trying to confront the killer Jason, but it's hard to empathize with any of the (deliberately, perhaps) throwaway figures on the projection.Part of the success of Friday the 13th - Part 2 was due to the competent direction of Steve Miner, who participated in the first one as an associate producer. More than the job, he is said to have been alongside Sean S. Cunningham during the major creative decisions of the original film and that he would have even directed some scenes. Miner diligently replicates all of Sean S. Cunningham's stylistic marks in the original. The camera movement that constantly puts us in the assassin's POV is mandatory, and ends up causing an effect similar to the first one. However, as the original twist was about Mrs. Voorhees being responsible for the murders, the POV never left her figure until the final scene. Here, with Jason already established as the assassin, Miner can play better with the silhouette and menacing presence of the villain, who doesn't yet have his hockey mask, but wears a white cloth bag that can be frightening depending on the angle or the Peter Stein lighting. There are a lot of good ideas at the climax as well, with the protagonist making use of Mrs. Voorhees's sinister severed head to try to confront Jason, and maybe just for that moment the movie is worth the visit.Although it's not a great thing, if you buy the idea and don't keep establishing a series of questions about verisimilitude, the narrative takes off and fun is guaranteed. The pace is better than the first foray on the unlucky day, the performances are on average for the available script, there are tense and very well-planned scenes, such as the chase in a hut involving someone under the bed and some mice that they appear to spoil other people's hiding places, in addition to the final scene, with a fright similar to that preached in the previous film, this time, more technically worked, in short, more intense.The body count is higher than before, but still reasonable by series standards: there are young men impaled during sex, there are throats spouting blood, as well as hammering, stabbing and other verbal conjugations involving bladed weapons. The soundtrack remains interesting, as it manages to relate to the scenography of isolation and fear. This part 2 delivers a more agile narrative than the first film, as well as following a new path. Jason has taken the lead in the killing on Crystal Lake, which has become the basic scenic space for creative pursuits and assassinations as we find out more about Jason. In one scene, we discover that he lives in a shack made up of scrap wood and building materials, where he keeps an altar adorned with burning candles around his mother's head. Jason gains a little depth here as the reason for his kill becomes clearer. The man with the mentality of a traumatized child, who refuses to accept his mother's death and does what he thinks would please her. His murders are a kind of sacrifice in honor of his holy mother, the only person who cared about him. So much so that even the soundtrack reproduces this devotion: the chorus ""ki-ki-ki-ki, ma-ma-ma-ma"", eerily whispered during the tensest moments, originates from the phrase ""kill her, mommy"" (kill her, mom).In the end, Friday the 13th: Part 2 comes almost like a remake of the original, but with some refinements over its form and the Jason Voorhees mythology. Far from being a great movie or a memorable sequel, it lives up to Cunningham's work. Despite the shallow characters and clichés - some irritating - the most important question for any horror fan: is the movie tense? Yes! The early 1980s scared a lot of people, and compared to the 21st century releases so far, you could say that this 1980s slasher movie sequel is way better than average.",Friday the 13th Part 2
117,mario_c,"""Jason is a legend""",7,10 February 2009,"This is a cult movie for me. Unlike the first Friday THE 13TH which I had never seen before, this movie is one of those which I had already watched in my teenage years, and which introduced me into Horror films (together with other sequels of this series, ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series, among others). It's also the first movie where JASON really starts getting some action... This film has some remarkable scenes (at least for me!) like the death(s) with the spear (when JASON kills the couple in bed with just one spear) or that scene near the end where we see the girl imitating JASON mother. I think this sequel is more suspenseful than the original and is better done. It is better acted and better produced, even though it has a similar plot and clichés. The soundtrack is also similar but quite nice, with those unforgettable and distinctive creepy sounds.",Friday the 13th Part 2
118,Ben_Cheshire,Makes the formula too specific + constricting.,8,30 June 2004,"(spoilers)The second movie is very important in a series like this because it often sets the trend for exactly what elements of the original movie will be taken as the ""formula"": which elements the audience needs to see to take this as a ""Friday the 13th"" movie. The elements that Steve Miner has solidified as the formula from Cunningham's movie are: killer's first person POV, or we follow the killer's shoes, the relationship between sex and death, young teens on summer camp around camp crystal lake, great variety in types of deaths, no-one finds out about the characters who've already died as the movie progresses, because it takes place in such a short period of time, the CH-CH-CH HA-HA-HA, and, most important, the gradual development of suspense.Friday the 13th Part II is unique in that the part of the myth that the rest of the series took its cue from was actually this movie, not the first one: ie, Jason = Friday the 13th. This time the characters aren't as annoying, and the girls are much cuter, but its just like watching the first movie again, except the killers have swapped.What Miner has done is carried over far too many elements from the first. The formula is just too much: it extends to setting, character and story. Its just too constricting. There's only so many times you can watch a bunch of teenagers accidentally camp around crystal lake again and not believe Jason is real. I'll be interested to see how the makers of the next movie cope with this constraint, actually.6/10. By far less significant than the first film.

119,EijnarAmadeus,Campy Jason,5,22 November 2010,"Friday THE 13TH PART 2 is basically the same film as the first one with the only major difference being the killer's identity. It opens with the surviving heroine (from Friday THE 13TH, who killed Jason's mother) being murdered with an ice pick in her own home, and from there we jump to some nubile campers visiting Crystal Lake and soon encountering bloody executions. Parts of the first 20+ minutes feels and looks exactly like the first film, but in all its simplicity the film is one of many slasher-horrors that's entertaining to watch, especially with like-minded friends, and first of all enjoying the characters and the way they're being killed.

120,acidburn-10,better than the first,10,27 May 2005,"Five years after the horrible massacre at Camp Crystal Lake, all that remains is the legend of Jason Voorees and the death of his demented mother who had murdered 7 campers until one get her.It starts of with Alice (Adrienne King) the survivor of the first one, having nightmares about the events of 5 years ago at camp crystal lake. She's living alone in a spooky house and talks to her mother on the phone about trying to put her life back together, unaware that Jason is lurking around outside, she jumps in the shower and gets phonecall, a hang up from Jason, she goes into the kitchen, opens the fridge door finds a human head and Jason pops up and rams a screwdriver through her head.Then we meet Sandra (Marta Kober) and Jeff (Bill Randolf), on a payphone to they're friend, then Crazy Ralph from the first one appears warning them like last time ""I Told the others they didn't believe me, you're all doomed, you're all doomed"".Eventually they join the other campers at a camp site near camp crystal lake, we get the new meat head councilor Paul Holt (John Furey), Terri (Kirsten Baker) one of the early victims, Ted (Stuart Charno) the funny one, Jeff and Sandra the carefree lovers, Mark (Tom McBride) wheelchair guy, Vicky (Lauren Marie Taylor) the nice girl, Scott (Russell Todd) the charmer and last but not least the main heroine Ginny (Amy Steel) who's the best last girl out of the entire series in my opinion.Overall, much better than the first one, the deaths are wicked especially the one with the 2 people in bed together getting speared, and even the guy in the wheelchair gets it, in the face with the machete, Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney) makes a final appearance as crazy ralph before he gets garotted with barb wire and the one with the guy gets caught in the trap and has his throat slit hanging upside down.The only standout performance is from Ginny (Amy Steel) who was also impressive in April Fools Day, really goes for it with Jason in the final showdown between killer and heroine.",Friday the 13th Part 2
121,Darkside-Reviewer,I hope Muffin survived,6,28 June 2020,"Friday the 13th part 2 was released just one year after the original was a massive success for Paramount making over $32.000.000 at the box office it even out grossed The Shining.Part 2 had a budget of one million dollars and
took only one month to film. There originally was no plans for a sequel but because of the first movies success and the publicity gained from the violence in cinema controversy that became a hot button topic especially in the 1980s when the Horror/Slasher movie genre was at it's peak with hundreds of movies being made over the span of a decade ranging from successful and unique movies like The Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and The Child's Play franchise to low budget exploitation movies like Hell of the Living Dead, movies made to quickly cash in on the horror movie craze of the 1980s.Friday the 13th part 2 was the first movie to feature Jason Voorhees as the now iconic killer in the franchise. In this movie Jason is still human and can feel pain which gives the movies third act chase scene's more tension because even though he is a psychoticly deranged killer with no real intelligence who kills anything or anyone that trespasses on his territory he can still be hurt and killed so he takes his time killing his victims when they are alone and away from the group watching and waiting from a distance until the time is right then killing each victim in extremely violent ways. Where as in the later entries he becomes more a supernatural being who can just teleport himself next to his victims and essentially becomes unkillable so nobody can hurt him or outrun him taking all the tension out of the chase scene's and making it just another Friday the 13th movie.This movie always seems to come up as one of the terrible sequels in the franchise but that is simply not the case while it's knowhere near being cinematic gold it is still one of the better movies in the Friday the 13th franchise and in the slasher movie genre it has some memorable kills a strong and intelligent lead actress who beats Jason and doesn't scream so loud your eardrums bleed.I recommend watching Friday the 13th part 2 if your a fan of Horror/Slasher movies and enjoy movies that don't take themselves to seriously and while this isn't the best entry in the franchise it's still entertaining and bloody.",Friday the 13th Part 2

This time Jason Voorhees makes his first participation as the killer, the murder scenes are gory, thanks to Tom Savini. The plot is similar to the first film, but Steve Miner knows how put his own print. The score is really suspenful, Amy Steel is an amazing last girl, the film locations are another summer camp by a lake, creepy ones specially when it rains. Jason is in Crystal lake and ready for a killing spree. Classic slasher sequel!",Friday the 13th Part 2

This one was based more on Jason, but the first was based on Jason's mother, Mrs Vorhees. The first movie was made in 1980 and then a year later the 2nd was made in 1981. Years and years later there were more and more of theses movies, i wonder when they will stop because in ever movie jason vorhees has to come back to life. To kill again. I wonder if there will be a re-make of friday the 13th, maybe one day they might be one, we'll all have to wait and see what happens in the future.

124,TalesfromTheCryptfan,A nice introduction to Jason Voorhees!,8,10 February 2009,"In 1979 two months after the horrific killings in Camp Crystal Lake, survivor Alice (Adrienne King) has moved on with her life but gets murdered mysteriously. Five years has passed and now a new camp lead by Paul (John Furey) and girlfriend Ginny (Amy Steel) have opened up a new Camp Counselor training facility just near Camp Crystal Lake or what the locals call ""Camp Blood"". Rumors have it that Jason Voorhees (Warren Gillette) is still alive for he didn't drown but lives in a shack as a hermit seeking revenge for his mother's death. Mysterious deaths have occurred as some of the trained counselors are disappearing one by bloody one, it's up to Paul and Ginny to unmask who this killer is behind these atrocious happenings.An exciting and well paced sequel to the 1980 slasher classic! after the first movie was a huge success for Paramount Pictures, the studio decided to green-light a sequel and a possible franchise thus it was born. This is the movie that introduced horror fans and moviegoers to the infamous Jason Voorhees as in the first movie it was his mother that was the killer but he did made a couple of tiny appearances especially near at the end of the first one. Betsy Palmer does a great cameo as Pamela Voorhees but in a mirage sequence, although Jason is the killer in this movie he doesn't don his infamous hockey mask until the next movie instead in this one he wears an Elephant Man-esquire burlap sack over his head with an eye-hole to cover his hideous face. The body count is higher this time with some good gore and death scenes such as for example the Icepick to the skull and the machete to the face of a crippled person sequence.This one offers good jump scares, gory violence and of course one bizarre ending but this installment is a solid entry that is a nice first starring role of the Jason Voorhees character who became an 80's horror icon with Freddy Kreuger.",Friday the 13th Part 2

There is no attempts at originality or good acting. There is a good amount of gore, blood and nudity.

127,LebowskiT1000,A good sequel,7,15 August 2002,"I've never been a fan of the horror genre, but I thought I'd finally give these films a chance nonetheless.  Given that these movies are incredibly cheesy, the film is pretty good...for a slasher film.I was really shocked to learn that Jason Vorhees wasn't even a main character in the original ""Friday the 13th"" and even more shocked to learn that neither ""Friday the 13th"" nor ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" features Jason Vorhees with a hockey mask.  I guess I'll have to see the next installment now and see if they introduce the hockey mask there.The story in this one is pretty much what you'd expect from this sort of film, nothing terribly complex and a lot of scenes to make you jump.  I kind of chuckled a little after watching the film because the formula for this film is EXACTLY the same as the first ""Friday"" film.  I'm sure you've seen both films you will agree with me.  I don't really think that is a bad thing, just kind of an interesting observation.All I can say is that if you're a fan of slasher movies, then you should definitely see this film, but make sure you see the first installment before watching this one.  I hope that you enjoy the film.  Be sure to check out my reviews for the other ""Friday"" films.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Friday the 13th Part 2
128,raypdaley182,Awful,1,13 October 2007,"Starting where the last film finished with a recap in case you'd forgotten how it finished is this films intro. Already you know Jason died as a child, his mother is dead meaning there is no danger and the entire point of the film is debunked before it ever starts. Trying to ask ""but did Jason actually die?"" only succeeds in debunking the ending of the original so is also pointless.Right, a camp next door to where Crystal Lake used to be is starting up. Now the 1st BIG goof is the assistant saying the phones aren't working yet. Not true as the guy who has his truck towed was talking to the camp for directions.The campfire story about Jason possibly being alive is pointless. We were told he wasn't a strong swimmer (and was far out in the lake when he drowned) and he was only a child so he'd have had to have taught himself wilderness survival in an area where there were bears.The 1st to die is a local old man peeping on a couple kissing. Next to die is the local sheriff having chased a mysterious figure to a shack in the woods (where WAS he hiding by the way?). Finally one of the camp workers is killed (he was hung by a mantrap so an easy kill) though why their considered prey I don't know, their NOTHING to do with Crystal Lake.Next dead is the guy in the wheelchair (from behind as well, what a coward!). And he then kills a couple who were in bed having sex. And the girl in the sweater. The main camp leader is next to die in front of his assistant and she is the only one alive apart from the guy left at the bar.Now she had a chance to kill him (the guy we're supposed to think is Jason) using the chainsaw, why she didn't when she'd seen him kill her boss and knew he'd killed all her other friends already is beyond me. It later appears he HADN'T killed her boss, just knocked him out as he turns up to save her in the shack where Mrs Voorhees head was.You are left with a possible but uncertain if it was fake scare at the end and the assistant being put into an ambulance and driven away. It is unknown if the boss was alive and what happened to the guy they left at the bar.A very weak ending in a very stupid & pointless film.",Friday the 13th Part 2
129,Beejerman,CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),7,11 November 2021,"The stage curtains open ...The legend of Camp Crystal Lake continues in this 2nd entry into the Friday the 13th franchise featuring a whole new crop of camp counselors for Jason to knock off. Jason Vorhees moves front and center now as the main antagonist and infamous killer. The opening sequence starts us off catching us up with Alice, the first movie's sole survivor and is the foundation for not only this movie, but pretty much all the movies to follow.We flash forward 5 years into the future when we join a new counselor crew in a camp nearby Crystal Lake, and our young, unsuspecting bunch is stalked once more by a killer unseen. By now, the story of Jason Vorhees and his mother has become a local urban legend that is whispered around campfires. One of the camp counselors, Ginny, believes that it is more than just a story. She believes that Jason is real and that his story is not only tragic, but sad. But when the truth of it all hits too close to home, the sadness is replaced with the need to survive.As sequels go, this one was pretty good. It continued the story effectively from the first movie as we are exposed to Jason, now fully grown and running around through the trees with a burlap sack over his head and a pitchfork in his grizzled hands. Yes, Jason actually runs in this movie - a brief time before he dons a hockey mask and plods heavily around through the underbrush. And watching Kirsten Baker walk through the woods in short shorts is worth the price of admission alone.I recommend this movie at a solid 7 stars out of 10, the same rating I gave the first movie. I'm not saying it is on par with the original, but pretty close. There are some good jump scares, and memorable death scenes. The final sequence was well filmed, and the final scare was worth the wait. Dark tones, good visuals, and a fun scarefest. Friday the 13th - Part 2 delivers.",Friday the 13th Part 2

Basically it's a re-hash of the original, only this time the murderer isn't quite so mysterious. Once again, there's plenty of gory murders to be had, in fact the murders of this film closely mirror those of Mario Bava's great Reaziane a catena (1971). Adrienne King of the original film reprises her original role early for a pretty good opening sequence, while Betsy Palmer briefly appears toward the end of the film during a tense showdown.The likable cast is pretty average, Amy Steel being best in her decent heroine role.Overall, a by-the-numbers slasher, but not without its entertaining merits.

As a matter of fact, it's just about as good as the first movie. Part 2 is pretty much like part 1: a group of young people get slaughtered in a woodsy summer camp by a monstrous maniac. It's a scary, gruesome, entertaining horror show, with some likable characters (Amy Steel is a standout as the heroine). At least this one doesn't have as much of Betsy Palmer (as Mrs. Voorhees) as the first one did. Her overacting performance in part 1 was screamingly hilarious (and ridiculous). Nevertheless, ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" is a gory movie for people who are slasher movie fanatics like me if the film is well made. Yes, this slasher movie is well made.

132,baileycrawly,An Improvement on the Original,8,26 October 2019,"I'm far from the first person to say that I believe this film is a major improvement over the original.
The original was very cut-and-paste, a story that relies on convenience and the lack of logic to propel its characters forward. It was a fun enough slasher to watch with friends, but it held nothing in the way of a memorable storyline.
This movie, while still falling victim to a few of the problems of the original (with one of those problems literally being copied and pasted, same actor and all, from the original), has enough of a unique storyline to be a much more interesting film. This is the first time Jason himself personally goes around killing, which is great.
Overall, it's still not much more than a typical slasher (the Jason movies never appealed to me as much as some other franchises) but it kept me mildly entertained so, for that, I have to give it an 8/10. More memorable than the original, but not much more so.",Friday the 13th Part 2

This movie has probably been heavily bashed already for not being original, try it before you bash it. This movie takes place 5 years after the first. No one has returned to the Crystal Lake camping area since the massacre in the first film. A class of counselor recruits are at a camp for training. Unfortunately, the camp is located right across the lake from Camp Crystal Lake. Although Mrs. Voorhees is dead, that does not mean the killing has stopped. The survivors of the first movie are the first to be killed. Alice (Adrienne King) Is killed at home only 2 months after the first movie had ended. This is Jason's first kill ever. 5 years later, at the counselor camp, Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney) returns to stalk this new set of campers. However, Jason catches on and he is killed off fairly early, only the 2nd death in this movie. Also, 2 teens, Sandra(Marta Kober) and Jeffrey(Bill Randolph) decide to explore Camp Crystal lake but are caught by a sadistic cop, Deputy Winslow (Jack Marks). Soon after, Winslow encounters Jason and gives chase after him into the woods. He reaches a shack that Jason has made and enters, only to be killed from behind. Not only is he the first cop ever to be killed in the series, he is the first to make it to Jason's home...alive anyway. Over all, this was a good movie.

Icon Jason Vorhees makes his first appearance in the sequel and obviously from here on out, Jason goes down into slasher lore as one of the great horror movie characters. Part II is a great film to kick back and collect some 80's nostalgia. However, the film lacks quality writing, has a long-winded recap, a shoddy ode to a Texas Chainsaw Massacre character, and death sequences that are at times poorly executed. Also, Amy Steel, similarly to Adrienne King, didn't showcase a strong screen presence and is not as memorable as other ""final girls"" in slasher flicks. Aside from its problems, Friday the 13th Part II is an enjoyable film and is followed by a band of horror fans that are a lot more optimistic about the film than I as a viewer.",Friday the 13th Part 2
142,theshadow908,"Boring, incredibly flawed slasher film.",4,14 March 2006,"With the ending of the first film, it seemed only right to continue the story. I guess they figured they didn't need to improve anything. In this movie we find out that Mrs. Voorhees' son Jason never drowned, but he became a hermit in the woods. Now he's out to avenge his mother's death as some counselors open a camp adjacent to Camp Crystal Lake.This movie is basically an exact copy of the first film, only now Jason is doing the killing. The stalking scenes are the same as before, and it ends up just dragging. This movie isn't really as entertaining as the first one. It drags on and on, and you have to wait until basically the end to see anyone die. The death scenes are so terribly done that they're laughable. Did anyone actually find this scary? I really can't say anything about the acting, because like any Friday the 13th movie, it stinks really bad. But the terrible acting isn't really worth complaining about compared to how bad everything else is. Of course, I have to cut this movie a little slack, because Jason appears for the first time.Like the first film, mindless entertainment, just not as entertaining.4/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
143,bh_tafe3,Hmmm...,5,6 December 2008,"This really isn't a bad horror film sequel. It lacks the atmosphere of the original but is effective in creating chills. The kills are creative enough.The early films in this series are notable mainly for firsts. This is the first time we see Jason, who is understandably upset by his mother's untimely death in the original. He doesn't have the trademark hockey mask yet, instead donning a far more scary, but not near as iconic, bedsheet.He seems rather axe happy in this one, and is given plenty of annoying teenagers to slice up.Nude scenes once again, a good dose of blood as well. Decent horror film, but by no means essential.",Friday the 13th Part 2

Although he seems to be seeking revenge, he just appears to be seeking some missing maternal attention.  The attempt to use ""child psychology"" on him on the end is classic hokey film making.The real reason to see this one is Kirsten Baken's nude scene.I have just one question:  Where the hell did he get the hockey mask after they took away his burlap sack (like in ""Elephant Man"")?",Friday the 13th Part 2
145,buckikris,Holt It's Been 5 Year's; But If I Were You I'd Locate In The Next County.,10,15 September 2019,"The sequel returns Alice( Adrienne King), in a small bit part in the beginning. Two months have passed since her horrendous trauma with Mrs. Voorhees. She seems to be getting along O.K. considering what had happened to her. She still has nightmares about what happened, and seems to have a rocky relationship with her mom. When she gets a hang up call one night, she begins to worry. She still wonders what happened to the boy Jason, and wonders if if we he who called?After the call she decides to lock up, but she still hears rumbling outside. When she goes to feed the cat, she opens the fridge and sees Mrs. Voorhees severed head. There with an ice-pick is a grown Jason who tracks her down to get revenge.It's been 5 years and a counselor training camp is opening up, this camp is on the same lake as the infamous camp Crystal Lake. The head counselor, Paul( John Furey) believes it's a legend and doesn't take the Jason thing seriously. He also doesn't want his CIT's worrying about it. His co-counselor, Ginny(Amy Steel); believes there is more to the story.Everything seems to be going well at first until crazy Ralph is killed spying on Ginny and Paul while they are in a cabin together. The next day Ginny has a sixth sense to her while the group is out in the woods. She feels like someone or something is watching; but shrugs it off later. While the group is taking a break at the lake Sondra( Marta Kober) begs Jeff( Bill Randolph) she has to see Camp Blood. So the 2 take off and come to the fenced off area. There they find a dead dog, and come into contact with the local sheriff( Jack Marks). They get hauled in and Paul is warned about keeping his people away from the place. The Sheriff explains that it has been calm and the last thing they need is trouble brewing again.That night Paul gives most of the counselors the night off, before their training begins. Jeff and Sondra are two that have to stay behind, some others remain too. While the majority have gone to the local bar, those left behind eventually find something to do. It doesn't take long for the stragglers before they start getting bumped off. The kill scenes are not as graphic as those in the original, but are still cringe worthy.When Ginny and Paul return to the camp they wonder what has happened. Why does the place look so unkempt? Ginny wonders what is going on especially since they can't find anyone? Paul tells her to calm down and everything is fine. When the two discover the bloody sheets in the bedroom, the lights go out. Ginny and Paul work their way to the rec room were she warns Paul somebody is in here. Soon Jason pops up from the shadows and goes after Paul. Ginny is on her own and tries to get help. From her Ginny fins Jason's shack, tricking him, until Paul finds her. The two unmask him once Ginny knocks him unconscious. The two are horrified at what they see, and Paul helps Ginny to the closest cabin. The is questionable, did they have a final fight with Jason or not? Some believe when Jason comes through it's all in Ginny's mind. I like to think Paul survived, but we are still left in limbo.In Conclusion, this is a great sequel to a slasher film; and I was surprised since it was rushed out after Friday the 13th. The very end is a little unnerving in Jason's shack. I was waiting for Mrs. Voorhees eyes to open, because the camera kept zooming in on her severed head. It is still a mystery about Paul and some may see this as a buzz kill; but you are left to your own conclusion.",Friday the 13th Part 2
146,DigitalRevenantX7,Dumb as hell.,3,9 December 2008,"Alice, the sole survivor of the Crystal Lake Massacre, is murdered in her house. Years later a new summer camp in spitting distance of the old camp is preparing to open. During one night, an intruder sneaks into the new camp, intending to butcher the counsellors.The original ""Friday the 13th"" was in many respects the film that popularised the slasher genre. It also set the basic formula that became the norm for dozens of cheap horror flicks. This time the directorial reins have passed over to Steve Miner, who worked on the original.As was the case with most of the nine sequels, ""Part 2"" is nothing more than an excuse to showcase more killings. This time it doesn't stop at ten. The film has no real style, just showing teenagers in skimpy outfits before having the killer take them out. As usual the script is what script? It's just a killer on a rampage. Cut & paste that for the plot. The acting is atrocious, with the teenagers being the usual numbskulls. But the film's main problem is the fact that the killer, who wears a burlap sack over his head, is Jason Voorhees, the kid who died in Camp Crystal Lake as a boy. This would have to be one of the dumbest plot points ever introduced in a film. The music score is the same old cheesy crap.",Friday the 13th Part 2
147,squeezebox,As good as the original (not that that's saying much),5,28 January 2003,"This first of many sequels is about on par with the original, quality-wise. Jason Voorhees, the little boy who supposedly drowned in Crystal Lake twenty-odd years ago, has become something of a local legend, sort of a boogey-man who lurks the woods. Unfortunately, the legend turns out to be true, as Jason himself (dressed like the Elephant Man) begins hacking up the new group of counselors, avenging his mother's beheading at the finale of the first movie.Apparently marred by drastic cuts to remove what were reputedly some pretty gruesome special effects (the MPAA sucks), which leave the film choppy and uneven. However, there are a few moments of enthusiastic carnage left intact (two counselors are simultaneously impaled while having sex, a paraplegic kid gets a machete in the face and rolls down a flight of stairs in his wheelchair) and there's a good deal more nudity than in the original.And you have to respect a movie in which a character gives away her hiding spot by wetting her pants! Directed by Steve Miner, who co-produced the original and went on the direct the far superior PART III. Paramount's DVD release is top-notch as far as picture and sound quality, but couldn't they have released the unrated version?",Friday the 13th Part 2

That's even considering the rules of the genre: the killer can't die and can morph from one place to the other.So many scenes go on for so long that any chance of suspense is home and the filmmakers are doing everything they can to hit 90 minutes. The opening scene is excruciating.This movie uhhh... The fights are so horribly staged and unrealistic that it blew my mind. She hides behind the car he can't see her or hear her when she runs away? He tackles her in the woods and she goes behind the closest tree and he has no idea?I know movies take liberties for the sake of suspense but I couldn't find any rational that made any of the stuff in this movie work.",Friday the 13th Part 2
149,jcbutthead86,"A Terrific,Scary And Suspenseful Sequel And One Of The Best In The Series.",10,25 March 2015,"Friday The 13th Part 2 is a terrific,scary and suspenseful sequel that is filled with fine direction,a good cast,a solid score and memorable special effects. All of those elements make Friday The 13th Part 2 a worthy sequel to the original and one of the best in the series.Set five years after the original,Friday The 13th Part 2 tells the story of a group of young Camp counselors who are working at a new camp that's right next to Camp Crystal Lake(aka Camp Blood)and are being stalked by Jason Voorhees(Warrington Gillette)the son of Mrs. Voorhees(Betsy Palmer). Lurking and watching in the woods,Jason is going to give the group of Camp Counselors an unlucky,bloody and violent night they will never ever forget. After the Box Office success of the first Friday The 13th in 1980,the sequel Friday The 13th Part 2 was released a year later and was not only a Box Success but introduced audiences to one of the most iconic and memorable characters in the history of not only Horror Movies but film in general in the form of Jason Voorhees who's reign of terror would start with this film. Friday The 13th Part 2 is a great sequel that is such an entertaining and thrilling roller coaster ride that takes some of the elements in the original(camp setting,kills etc)and builds on them with ease and gives viewers an intense,suspenseful film. The scares and suspense in Friday The 13th Part 2 are well done with wonderful pacing and is very much like the original with terror coming and going with non-stop intensity that just grabs viewers by the throat whether it's the Jason POV shots,chase scenes or kills. Despite being one of the brightest looking movies in the entire series(especially during the daytime scenes)the atmosphere in F13 pt 2 is still pretty effective and creepy and gives viewers a sense of dread and fright where you feel like no one is safe from Jason's wrath and carnage. The Kills and gore in the film are creative,memorable and are among the best in the series with two killing scenes that are some of the most iconic of the franchise. The big chase scene is one of the best chase scenes in the in the franchise because there is tons of terror and fright that never stops and viewers won't be able to hold your breath. F13 P2 maybe one of the shortest films in the series(at 87 minutes)it's one of the most memorable. While the character Jason Voorhees makes his first appearance in this film he actually does well with a combination of being scary and at times clumsy(in a funny way). In this film(and three and four)Jason acts more like backwoods hillbilly and hermit wearing overalls and a potato sack on his head(no Hockey mask in this one) as an outcast of society and a demented killer. What also makes Jason great in this one is that we rarely see him until the very end because we only see his feet,hands or see him lurking in the background hiding out in the shadows waiting to kill and strike at anytime. As a result Jason isn't the Hockey Mask wearing antihero and star he became in the later sequels but Part 2 is still Jason at his very best. As for the other characters with the exception of the one main character Ginny(Amy Steel)none of the other characters while interesting aren't well-developed and let's face it the campers are just there to be in Jason's brutal slaughterhouse of death and pain. The ending of Friday The 13th Part 2 is great and filled with suspense and excitement but has caused debates and confusion among fans of the series over whether the ending really happened,did not happen or was a dream or not with no easy answers. A great ending.The cast is good. Amy Steel is wonderful and memorable as Ginny,with Steel bringing depth,courage and dimension to the role making Ginny one of the best final girls in the series. John Furey is good as Paul,Ginny's boyfriend. Warrington Gillette is fantastic as Jason,with Gillette being menacing and creepy. Martha Kober(Sandra),Tom McBride(Mark),Bill Randolph(Jeff),Lauren-Marie Taylor(Vickie),Stu Charno(Ted),Kristen Baker(Terry),Russell Todd(Scott)and Jack Marks(The Cop)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by actors from the first Friday The 13th such as Adrienne King(Alice),Betsy Palmer(Mrs. Voorhees)and Walt Gorney(Crazy Ralph).The direction by Steve Miner is great,with Miner always moving the camera and giving the film a good pace,style and atmosphere. Solid direction,Miner.The score by Harry Manfredini is terrific,suspenseful and adds to the film. Another wonderful score,Manfredini.The Special Make-up Effects by Carl Fullerton are impressive,bloody and memorable. Fine Make-up Effects,Fullerman.In final word,if you love Horror Films,the Friday The 13th series or Jason Voorhees,I highly suggest you see Friday The 13th Part 2,a terrific sequel and one of the best in the Friday The 13th series. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10.",Friday the 13th Part 2

151,Rendanlovell,Better then the original?,3,19 July 2020,"I wanna say that everything about this is worse or, at least, on par with the original. Yet, I can't say I hated this like I did the original. It's just bland and stupid. It quickly wraps up the loose threads from the original by killing its lone survivor straight away in a scene that doesn't matter at all to anything. Then it quickly moves into the actual story, the first one again but with more characters and worse direction. Characters are constantly looking at, hitting, or throwing things at the camera. Its jarring and clunky to put it mildly. There's absolutely no point to it and it happens over and over again. The budget is obviously higher then part 1 and the cast is like 3 times bigger. As we all know, bigger doesn't mean better. Just like the original the characters are dumb and bland but now that blandness is spread across 20 people instead of like 8. This means you're invested much less in these people, especially since the majority of the characterization is nothing more then their wardrobe. Every character wears different clothes, so they're different! Putting it simply, it's just so the film can have a higher body count. Like the first one, this wouldn't be bad if the kills were fun, but, for the most part, they aren't. Jason is actually in this unlike the first and you actually get to see deaths, so that's something. Plus, there's a few more memorable kills then in the first, like when the wheel chair man is smashed in the face with a machete and sent wheeling down a mysterious set of stairs. That was awesome and completely bizarre. That said, It's marginally less violent then part 1 and that's saying something. I heard the filmmakers were told to keep the blood down in this one and it does feel less gory. A lot of the kills in part 1 were off screen or awkward in some way but at least they are kinda gory thanks to Tom Savani (not even close to his best work though). Now, I don't need every slasher movie to be Day of Dead levels of gruesome. I don't need to see Joe Plato's legs get torn off in graphic detail in a Jason movie, but can I at least get more then a cheap looking stab or strangling? Is that to much to ask? One thing I liked about the orignal that isn't true here is the gritty tone and presentation. It was cheap but with the gorilla style you had a bit of edge to it. Like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre. That grittiness is all but gone here, as is the setting of a forsaken summer camp. Now it's just a camp kinda close to the old one. In short, I didn't have that vitriolic reaction to this I did with the first one but that's not to say this is better or even watchable. It feels a little more tongue in cheek with the constantly horny, cheesy dialogue which was fun, but that's faint praise. Some kills are fun and there are a lot more then in the original. However, If you don't have an interest in slasher movies, 80s horror, or even horror in general you can avoid this one.",Friday the 13th Part 2

153,loomis78-815-989034,This time it is Jason,8,23 February 2014,"The pre-credit sequence shows us Alice (King), the only survivor from the original, opening her refrigerator door and seeing the decapitated head of Mrs. Voorhees! She quickly gets an ice pick shoved into her skull by a faceless killer. It turns out to be Jason (Gillette), the deformed son of the deranged Mrs. Voorhees who is now avenging her death as she did his in the original. How Jason survived the drowning of the original film is never explained. Five years later Paul Holt (Furey) is opening a training program at the camp across from Crystal Lake with a new crop of teenage counselors and Jason begins his rampage. Staying exactly in the vein of the original, Part 2 is a body count film in its truest sense. You know the counselors are there to be slaughtered and Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney) is back warning of doom, so the question is how does it play out? With a good looking cast, and decent acting for the most part, this sequel has some nice slasher moments in it. Paul's background story of Jason around the campfire is so chilling and intense Part 4 in this series would use it to recap the series to that point. Director Steve Miner, an associate Producer on the original, directs with a sense of flair and adds some suspense to the stalk and chase scenes with Ginny (Steel) at the end which is a lot of fun. The overall production is glossier this time around and the ending in Jason's shack is a good one. Jason with a sack over his head and armed with a pitchfork most of the time impales two lovers together, and a vicious machete to the face of a man in a wheelchair could be the highlight kill of the movie. Great effects work by Carl Fullerton rival Savini's work in the original, even though the MPAA made them trim a lot away before it was released. An energetic score by Composer Harry Manfredini helps too. Part 2 adds nothing new other than Jason who really doesn't make any sense. If you just go with it, Part 2 is a solid slasher film.",Friday the 13th Part 2

Amazingly, there was no blood in that scene! It's a miracle! Then, five years later, some teenagers go to Camp Crystal Lake again. Why? I don't know. Then the murders start to happen. What a surprise. First, Crazy Ralph. Barbed wire is wrapped around his neck, thus killing him. Then a police officer. A hammer claw hits him in the back of the head. Then Scott.

I don't know what happened to her, she was killed off screen. Then comes Mark. While he's outside in his wheelchair, a machete comes out of nowhere and hits him in the face. He falls down some steps, to his death. Then Jeff and Sandra. They are both impaled at the same time. They die instantly. Then comes the last victim, Vicki. She is stabbed. Good last death, right? Then Paul and Ginny come back to the camp and find everyone's dead. Then the killer comes after them. Mark is hurt and the killer goes after Ginny.After a chase, Ginny finds a shrine built around Mrs. Voorhees's head and identifies that the killer is in fact Jason Voorhees, who supposedly drowned.

Instead, a potato sack will do sufficiently for this film! We see the original survivor, Alice Hardy (Adrienne King) killed off in the prologue in a kind of over-the-top scene. Sadly, according to IMDb's trivia section, Adrienne King chose to end her acting career after this film due to being stalked by an obsessive fan. Amy Steel is the main protagonist of the film, and she plays Ginny in this sequel, and I think she works better in this one.I liked this one better than the first, cause I guess I have an easier time believing it, and not taking it too seriously. The usual clichés are rampant throughout such as gory deaths, teens having sex or attempting to have sex, and shocker ending. The 80s seemed to spawn these types of movies, and this one is no exception. I can't claim to be a fan of this series, but it's hard to ignore Jason Voorhees as a horror icon. This one is a little more grounded than the sequels to come but is less entertaining, and number two is overall an improvement on the first film.**½ out of *****!",Friday the 13th Part 2

And honestly, I tend to mix up the details of each movie with one another, their basic structure being the same. But here is this part-2 which actually invented Jason and also the films' basic formula and so far, I consider this the best of the lot ( ""Jason Lives"" coming as the close second best and ""Jason goes to Hell"" being the worst). The cheesy formula of all the Friday slasher movies: bunch of youngsters in Camp Crystal Lake... night falls... some have sex... one/two girls get skinny-dip in the lake... (the lead female always most decently dressed)... silent Jason with sharp weapon... killing begins... others discover bodies before themselves become victims... Now they all started from this movie, not exactly from Part-1. And here the kills, I should say, are actually creepy.Now there are few things in this movie that are completely potty. For example, first, the girl from the first movie getting killed and second, the disgusting cloth Jason used to cover his face. It's a relief they introduced the famous hockey mask later in the series.

The original Friday the 13th movie is more creepy more scary and more original. This movie is fun but lacks on the story, it has problems with the killer and so on.I don't appreciate in this movie killing Alice Hardy (Adrienne King) the final girl and unique heroine from the first film, I hate that! The first time 10 years ago I saw this film I was major dissapointed. Adrienne King shouldn't have been in this movie at all and she should be again heroine but the actress was stalked by a stalker when the first movie come out, that was a true story so the girl feared for her life and she drop out of the movies. Killing Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney) was another problem I had. Screw this movie. They go off and kill 2 characters from the first movie. This movie shouldn't reflect on the original movie and should focus on the future sequel not the past.I love the first movie to death much better, the sequel is not near good as the first movie in my opinion. Sean S. Cunningham and Betsy Palmer were mad because Jason was alive all this time they were both angry because the writer and director changed the character.The killer Jason in this movie is not scary enough, he is laughable, humoristic maniac a white hood on his head with an eye with a looks like an farmer and a clumsy stupid killer! Jason originaly suppose to play Warrington Gillette but the guy did not know how to make his own stunts. What kind a stupid dumb moron was hired to play Jason when the idiot like he his couldn't make his own stunts? The idiot takes all the credits for playing Jason when actually he only played one scene. Steve Dash played Jason R.I.P. he is really missed. The mask was inspired by the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976).Steve Dash really palyed well Jason at one point he stated that the mask was so horrible to see trough, so he fall down few times. The plot was also confusing like what happened on the end to Paul Holt (John Furey) ? till it's day it was never explained.Amy Steel was xcellent as the main heroine but it would have been better if she would would be the soul survivor and would her self single defeated Jason, but Paul rescued her so thanks for nothing movie.

159,ReelCheese,Surprisingly Good,6,2 September 2007,"One jab constantly hurtled at the ""Friday the 13th"" series is that all of them are the same. Fans of the franchise know that's not true, though there's no denying this first sequel is as close to a remake of the original as you'll find. But for all the similarities to its predecessor, ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" is a surprisingly good horror film that, dare I say it, improves upon what it followed.""Friday the 13th Part 2"" is, obviously, where the iconic Jason got his first real start. And it was a humble start. Not the mindless zombie of the latter films, the Jason here lives in a cobbled-together shack in the middle of the woods, his mom's decapitated head on candle-lit display. This look into the inner sanctuary of Jason is quite fascinating, and probably tells us more about his personality than anything that has come since. Here he's not so much evil, but a deranged loner out to avenge his beloved mother's murder.And Jason gets that chance when a fresh crop of horny teens prepare to open a new camp not far from his old stomping grounds at Camp Crystal Lake. Consisting of another group of no-names, these would-be counselors are surprisingly well-defined and real. Director Steve Miner, who would go on to direct ""Part III,"" had said he wanted to give his characters more depth and ensure the film had strength even without Jason's presence. In that he succeeded. In too many horror films, the audience is left impatiently waiting for the killer to show up. Here, the story is engaging enough that the build-up is not a chore.The movie does liven up, of course, once Jason arrives. Miner chose to take the ""less is more"" approach to horror, with Mr. Voorhees making relatively few appearances. This generally works well, though a bit more Jason wouldn't have hurt. Jason's ""bag over the head"" get-up can't hold a candle to the hockey mask that would follow, but it does serve its purpose of cloaking the killer in an aura of mystery and, more importantly, building the suspense for the moment when it finally does come off.""Friday the 13th Part 2"" is not all that scary or thrilling, but it is a fun little horror film that should please those for whom it was intended.",Friday the 13th Part 2
160,geminiredblue,Second Time's A Charm!,6,7 October 2011,"In the early days of ""Friday the 13th"" there was almost an innocence surrounding the first four. Granted a viewer was guaranteed certain things: bloody deaths, sex scenes and nudity. But still there was an innocence that was lost as the series would go along. Enter Part 2. Taking place five years after the events of the first one, and after killing off the sole survivor from that first film, we're introduced to a new bunch of stereotypical camp counselors. Hormones are raging, pranks are pulled and everybody has a care-free attitude. (*Dramatic music*) That is until a deranged, sackcloth-wearing killer finds them on his turf. What follows is much like the first, however this time the identity of the killer is no secret. Yes, this is officially the movie that introduced Jason Voorhees to the world, minus his iconic hockey mask. But we can forgive them for that, after all the series was just getting started. In many ways I like it almost as much as the first. Finally throughout a night of bloodshed, we're left with Ginny, a cute blonde, and her boyfriend Paul (one of the worst names to have in a horror movie.) For the remaining twenty minutes, we get to witness the couple repeatedly attacked and terrified by Jason. The finale in the decrepit, ram-shackled house is pretty eerie. And I really like Ginny's solution to ward off Jason's final assault, using a combination of child psychology and an old sweater. It's quite inventive! Speaking purely from a guy's perspective, this movie has got one other reason to watch. The skinny-dipping girl is truly a sight to behold! So enjoy anyway you can!!!",Friday the 13th Part 2
161,happyendingrocks,This under-appreciated sequel deserves a more objective look,8,21 April 2011,"While most fans consider this to be one of the tamest entries in the franchise, Friday The 13th Part 2 is actually a very worthy successor to the classic original, and when judged on its own merits as opposed to its significance within the series as a whole, this holds up as an extremely well-crafted slasher offering.The tone of this sequel is similar to the first film, and while subsequent F13 outings would be primarily defined by their increasingly elaborate death scenes, Part 2's atmosphere is shaped by more traditional horror elements. Without FX guru Tom Savini on hand to handle the kills, the film-makers wisely refrained from trying to make this follow-up an inferior retread of Savini's classic work in the original. While this results in a much less gory movie, the murders are still shot and edited with great care, and even a relatively bloodless scene like the claw hammer to the cranium bit plays out as effectively explicit.Despite Part 2's reputation for being light on the special sauce, the film still boasts some of the most memorably macabre moments in the series. Both the double spear impalement and wheelchair-bound Mark's machete-driven backward plunge down the stairs are indelible and shocking moments that have only been diluted over time because of of how trained splatter fans later became to expect gallons of blood in every horror film.The film adds some great touches to the original story, and the glimpses we get of Jason's dilapidated make-shift shack sweet shack offer a logical and feasible extension of the Jason mythos. Likewise, his gruesome shrine to his beloved mother is a fantastic addition that enhances Jason as a character rather than simply an unstoppable killing machine, and it's a shame that none of the following sequels ever referenced it again.The most unfair criticism levied at this film is the notion that Jason's appearance is somehow not as iconic as it is in the later films. Again, perspective is key here. When this sequel was made, the idea of incorporating Jason's hockey mask hadn't even been considered yet, and the burlap sack over his head is actually a very fitting adornment in the scope of his story as it had been shaped up to this point. In Part 2, Jason is still just a deformed, mentally challenged psychopath living in the seclusion of the woods, so him using a crude, simple cloth sack to cover up his monstrous features actually makes perfect sense from a character stand-point. As for Jason himself, Steve Dash does an excellent job of bringing the character to life (the credits erroneously name Warrington Gillette as Jason, but Gillette actually only appeared in a single scene; for the bulk of the film, when we see Jason on screen we're seeing Dash). Kane Hodder is rightfully considered the ""best"" Jason, but in terms of sheer physicality, Dash gives the killer an imposing presence that we wouldn't see portrayed as impressively until Hodder donned the mask several sequels later.Amy Steel is a great heroine, certainly one of the most likable and capable in the series, and she heads a notably strong cast that largely eschews stereotypical teen archetypes in favor of acting like real people. The climax is tautly executed and brings the film to a satisfying close, and while the final jump-scare plays out like a copycat of the original, it still stands as a nice little ending jolt.Yes, Jason shouldn't have hair when we see him revealed during the denouement. Yes, the five-minute flashback sequence that opens the film causes the plot to take a while to get going. But otherwise, nearly every element in Part 2 is well-crafted, and while die-hards may bemoan the dearth of splatter here, as a pure horror film, Friday 2 is a thoroughly solid offering. For what it's worth, I would rank it as the 3rd best entry in the original eight-film Friday franchise, just below The Final Chapter and the original F13. Those are two lofty benchmarks to surpass, and considering how close this inaugural Jason outing comes to doing just that, I have to respectfully argue that Friday fans are selling this one way short.",Friday the 13th Part 2
162,illbebackreviews,"Here's JAASON!----Seriously, its a good film!",7,29 October 2012,"I don't normally rate the Friday the 13th films high even though I certainly enjoy them as its the same thing again and again... However, this was one of the better slasher-sequels I've seen. It certainly wasn't scary but it had a few jumpy scenes and I thought the opening scene with Alice was cleverly done. It was the spookiest part of the film for sure because you wouldn't be certain exactly how dangerous Jason could be. After that, the film does slow down tremendously to the point it actually got boring for a while. However, two quick kills get us drawn back to the film and away from unnecessary scenes and dialogue. The scene where the two people are having sex and Jason comes in was awesome as he suddenly comes in and kills them off. The awesome thing about this scene comes from when Ginny decides to check out her friends and why everything is quiet. She opens the blanket and Jason just jumps out like a BOSS! Then we see the two being brutally killed and this was by far the greatest Friday the 13th moment to date. After that, the last fifteen to twenty minutes was actually very exciting and it wasn't scary, but was kinda funny for me. From here to the end of the film, its all filled with tension. I, especially liked the scene where Ginny dresses up as Pamela to distract Jason, proving that despite he doesn't say a word and despite the fact that you can't see his face, you can CLEARLY see that he loves her so much. The scene was beautifully done, especially for a horror film. But as soon as Jason wises up, things get intense. There's some moments that briefly made me jump but it was really great at the end, giving it a solid 7/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
163,ryan-10075,This Time it's Jason's Turn,7,22 April 2020,"This time it's the son Jason Vorhees who is the killer and the start of the creation of a horror icon. A film that I have regularly revisited since I first saw it. The others in the series like that are parts 3, 4 and 6. This time Steve Miner takes directing duties with a script by Ron Kurz.At the beginning of the film we are reintroduced to Alice Hardy (Adrienne King) the survivour from part 1. Thing is they didn't need to go so deeply into telling her story. They just show us again the ending of part 1. I did not think that was done to well. They should have written a nice beginning story where like what happens here Alice is killed. From what I have heard they just improvised on the set what happens. If they created a better opening, something with bigger bite I think the opening may still have a great effect on audiences. But, instead you are just waiting for Jason to show and kill her. Back in 1981 though, perhaps this got the crowd geared up for a Jason movie.After the opening we see Camp Packanack is opening up on Camp Crystal Lake. Not the same camp ground where the murders by Pamela Vorhees took place, but close to it. Jason is not dead...or did not die....or something, and is out for blood. Just don't think took long about it for it may ruin the slasher experience of any of the sequels. I do enjoy the campfire scene where Paul (John Furey) tells the story about Jason. Has nice atmosphere to it.The one thing that they did better in part 2 is the characters are better. They are more rounded and different from each other. Some are more memorable. The final girl Ginny Field (Amy Steel) is to me the best in the series. She is tough, smart and she looks totally terrified in the end scenes with Jason. She is never bettered in any of the sequels' final girls and really it is a shame she never appeared in any of the other films. To me she is a much better final girl than Alice (who it seems some Friday fans rave about). I mean Ginny ain't perfect, but she may be the best for the series.On a final note to me Jason (credited to Warrington Gillette, but I do believe Steve Dash played him as well) in this film wears a sack over his head. To me that reminds me of THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN. But, it is still interesting and gives Jason a crazed hillbilly look. But, I much prefer the hockey mask Jason.",Friday the 13th Part 2
164,Toronto85,Friday the 13th Part 2,9,11 March 2011,"Friday the 13th 2 is a definite step up from the original. The plot is similar, young camp counsellors are setting up the site getting ready for young campers when all of a sudden an unseen assailant starts picking them off one by one. Eventually we see the killer as a man wearing a potato sack over his head. The movie starts with the lead character from the first one getting killed in her apartment. It really sets the eerie tone for the whole movie. There is no mystery to solve here with regards to the killer's identity. Jason Vorhees starts killing counsellors after seeing his mother beheaded in the first one.Amy Steel is the heroine in this sequel and her character Ginny was always one of my favourite characters to go up against Jason in the end. Also noted that the hockey mask isn't what Jason wears. It's a potato sack with one eye hole cut out of it for him to see. Now I always felt that the sack was creepier than the trademark hockey mask. The movie does have strong gore, but doesn't rely on it to scare the audience. I always felt that Part 2 relied on suspenseful moments and genuine scares than extreme gore. The creepiest part for me was when Ginny and Paul got back to the camp after a night out and Jason was hiding in the darkness of the living room waiting to kill them. We as the viewers didn't even know he was there until Ginny whispered that she thought there was someone in the room.The chase scenes through the woods with Ginny (Amy Steel) and Jason was very well done. One of the best Friday sequels to date and must see for horror fans 9/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
165,Mr_Censored,"A little less than it's predecessor, a little more than it's followers.",7,13 February 2009,"One of the better ""Friday The 13th"" sequels, ""Friday The 13th Part 2"" is an often sleazy, always fun and sometimes suspenseful sequel that gives birth to one of the most notorious and celebrated horror villains: Jason Vorhees. Directed by Steve Miner (production manager on the first film, and director of other genre fare such as ""House"" and ""Halloween H20"") and featuring the return of much of the crew that brought us the original film, it should come as no surprise that the film carries an unmistakable feeling similar to it's predecessor.Truth be told, Miner has hardly the visual panache that made Sean S. Cunningham's original film work so well, but for what he lacks in visual stimulation, he more than makes up for in suspense. Unlike many of the sequels that would follow, ""Friday The 13th Part 2"" tries and succeeds (mostly) at building up genuine suspense before dispatching of it's cardboard characters. Yes, unfortunately this film is sorely lacking character depth. Aside from the leading lady, Ginny (Amy Steel), and an unfortunate wheelchair-bound victim, the unhappy campers in this film are a rather weak batch. Steel's character more than makes up for that fact, though, as she is one of the more intriguing women in slasher films. She parties up with the rest of the camp -- even partaking in the prerequisite premarital sex -- and yet lives to see another day.The birth of Jason is a somewhat awkward one. His appearance in this film hardly matches his appearance in others, and it's not just because he wears a bag over his head instead of a hockey-mask. This Jason appears to be a very simple, yet very deformed human who has survived by dwelling in and feeding off the wilderness. When he stalks Alice (Adrienne King, reprising her role from the first film) prior to the opening credits, he comes across as more of an every-day killer than an unstoppable monster, or even a zombie, as he would be later portrayed. What that means is that this Jason is actually much more effective and believable than the Jason we have all come to know and love. Praise Kane Hodder and the like to no end, but for my money, Warrington Gillette and Steve Dash (who played Jason out of and into costume, respectively) delivered the most true to life and creepiest Jason to date.The film is not without it's ups and downs. Nevermind the fact that he never really made a ""great"" film after this -- it's pretty obvious that Steve Miner was an untested and inexperienced film-maker at the time. He tries many times to ape Cunningham's look, but barely succeeds. The film looks and even feels kind of cheap, even for it's time and budget. The make-up effects are a sad step down from the first, but -- as mentioned before -- the film's saving grace is that it's got some truly suspenseful scenes and some rather unsettling moments. It's got a real mean streak, which probably led to may heartless clones in it's wake, but which makes for a unique movie in it's own universe. As far as the other ""Friday The 13th"" films go, this is one of the better ones. Despite it's meager production values, it still gets the job done and delivers a nice creepy dosage of 80's horror fun.",Friday the 13th Part 2
166,BloodTheTelepathicDog,Solid sequel//contains spoilers,5,11 December 2004,"The film begins with lone survivor Adrienne King at home, which somehow Jason finds her, and undramatically disposes of her with an icepick. Afterwards we are taken to a camp, near Crystal Lake, where your typical group of teen counselors arrive, complete with the stereotypes. The lusty couple Marta Kober(with her tremendous assets) and Bill Randolph, the prankster Stu Charno, the slut Kristen Baker...you get the picture, right? Jason shows up with a sack over his head and causes large amounts of mayhem.Not as gory as the majority of the 13th films, I'm just glad they didn't make a habit out of the goofy sack on Jason's head. The hockey mask fits him better.",Friday the 13th Part 2
167,CMRKeyboadist,Hello Jason,9,10 August 2006,"Friday the 13th part 2 is probably the best of the early Jason films (1-4) and is definitely different considering that most people unfamiliar with the films will not realize that this is Jason's first appearance (minus the scene at the end of the first movie) and that it was Jason's mother murdering everyone in the first one. Also, Jason's trademark hockey mask isn't anywhere to be found here. Instead, he wears a pillow case over his head (that is what I always thought it was).As you can probably tell that this is standard in the fact that another group of naive teenagers decide to open another Summer Camp and pay for it horribly. Though, this one has a nice sort of twist in the end when Ginny (Amy Steel) dresses like Mrs. Voorhies and tries to calm Jason down.Of course, the killings in this movie aren't quite as good as they were in the first movie but there is still a few scenes that will grab your attention. Most notable is the poor fellow in the wheelchair. That was probably the best/worst scene in the whole movie or in any of the Jason movies.Also, the way Jason looks without the pillow case over his head is interesting. He is deformed, of course, but he has long hair and is wearing overalls with a plaid shirt on. He looks like a mutated killer farmer. He isn't very big either which makes his appearance somewhat more realistic.Well, if you haven't seen this movie and you are a fan of the series check it out. This is probably my favorite of all of them but it is hard to say since most of them have their moments. 9/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
168,varghesejunior,Same old stuff and even more vulgar,5,17 January 2013,"The concept of this film is more or less the same as part 1 - Only that there are more characters and it is more vulgar.So of course the story is about a group of summer campers this time who go to the forest under the guidance of a couple of tour guides,after being warned to stay away from Lake crystal camp(which has been shut for the past 5 years after the incidents in FTT part 1),when something or someone unknown begins to attack them.The special effects are perhaps good for the 80's- nowadays even a kid won't be scared of them. The acting is unremarkable.It is a film totally unsuited for young minds owing to the vulgarity.Why I watched?? Because I like horror films, that's all.",Friday the 13th Part 2
169,kingofdanerds,Only a cat's whisker better than the original Friday film,6,21 January 2021,"The first Friday the 13th film was such a financial success, that a sequel was made the next year. Friday the 13th Part 2 was released in 1981 and was once again a financial success. It made over $20 million against a budget of just over $1 million. It was not a critical success upon release, but in recent years it has been a fan favorite and is often debated as to whether or not it is the best sequel in the franchise. This time around, we have Steve Miner in the director's chair after Sean Cunningham declined to return for a sequel. This was Steve Miner's first film as a director and he would go on to direct the next Friday film, Friday the 13th Part III 3D and also go on to direct Halloween H20: 20 Years Later. The film itself was heavily cut due to the stinky MPAA who threatened to give this film an X rating. Sadly, there is no Uncut version (or at least that I am aware of). The film sees the return of Betsy Palmer and Adrienne King but only in minor roles.The film has a really bizarre opening (that I won't spoil) but our main story involves camp counselors in training. They are in a nearby camp that is right next to Camp Crystal Lake. Camp Crystal Lake is closed and nobody is allowed inside. Anyways, it is the same old stuff here. A killer is in the woods and this killer goes around and kills these sexed and drugged up counselors.Now, I somewhat debated on whether or not to reveal the identity of the killer seeing that the film kept it a secret for a good while. But, seeing that people are mentioning the killer by name in the non spoiler reviews, I might as well say, the killer is Jason Voorhees. This is the film that introduces Jason Voorhees as the killer. Yes, Jason is the star of the series but I can't just say this is a good film because of the debut of Jason Voorhees. Personally, I prefer the killer from the first film (which I did not reveal in my review in the first film so I am going to keep it that way but if you have seen this film, you will know who it is). The appearance of Jason is a ripoff of the killer from The Town That Dreaded Sundown. What I am trying to say is that yes, he does appear to perfectly represent what a deformed, killer man child would be, but he is just not that intimidating. Now, one thing that I wish I can review a little better is the kills which were heavily cut by the MPAA. That is not to say that what we do get is bad, because there are some really good kills in this film. Sure, effectswise, they are not on par with the Tom Savini effects, but they are still pretty good from what we can see. Now, the scares. It is kind of funny when you use the term scary with these films because they are far from being scary. But, there are occasional scenes throughout the series that are creepy and scary. While the first film had the atmosphere and the music to help with these scares, there are a few scenes where they do not rely on the atmosphere and music and are still rather effective. The characters, aside from Jason, are nothing new. They are only a slight improvement over the characters in the previous film because some of them do get some development. The final girl in this film is obvious from the start and is an improvement over the final girl in the previous film (and I did not really care for the final girl in the previous film). She is developed and there are some key details that do help her in the end. Aside from that, the characters are really the same sterotypes from the previous film. But in all, more likeable than the meat bags in the first film. I mentioned earlier in the plot descrption that the film has a bizarre opening. Without giving anything away, I will just say that it makes little sense and was entirely pointless in my opinion. It is slow and if you took it out of the film, you would not be missing too much or anything at all. The rest of the film is a slow burn, but not nearly as slow as the previous film. The climax in the previous film is really good and so is the climax in this film too. I constantly go back and forth as to whether or not this film's climax is better and even now I cannot decide. This film does not have as an atmosphere that the first film had, but it is very close. The cinematography is largely the same here. The film does rely on POV shots a little too much whereas in the first film, they were used rather effectively. The music is pretty much the same (and I am only saying that because I didn't really pay too much attention to it because it felt more like background noise). The ending of this film does try and pull a page from the first film and it is still not as effective. It all depends on how you look at it.Friday the 13th Part 2 is a film that I constantly go back and forth on and it seems that at the time of this review, I like it. Definitely not a film that does everything better than the first film, but when it does, it does it rather well.",Friday the 13th Part 2
170,Casey-52,A sequel that is a LOT better than the original,9,2 May 2000,"I don't know about the average horror film fan, but I found ""Friday the 13th"" very dull. I was not scared by it once. That didn't happen with its sequel!First off, the original heroine, Adrienne King, was a horrible actress, likable but horrible. Amy Steele takes over in this sequel and is miles ahead of any slasher film actress (save Jamie Lee Curtis). Gorgeous, likable, and a great actress! You feel for her character more than Adrienne King. The beginning is a great umbilical cord to the original, kicking off with a suspenseful stalking. The murders are more graphic, which is better in this case because that's why people see this series! And the final chase sequence is a WHOLE LOT better than ""Friday the 13th"". You'll need someone or something to clutch during these final scenes!So, this is, in my opinion, the high point of the series. Of course, it was all downhill from there.",Friday the 13th Part 2
171,RhapsodyReviews,Not a Fan.,5,6 October 2019,"Review:
'Friday the 13th Part 2' is an American slasher film directed by Steve Miner. It is the second installment in the 'Friday the 13th' film series. Can we first talk about how small Jason looks in this movie? I mean, he is still menacing, and I know this movie was before Jason was undead. I just thought it was funny and worth mentioning. All movies after 'Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter' Jason is a big, scary sonofabitch.
The movie picks up five years later, where a new murderer begins stalking the camp counselors at a nearby training facility on Crystal Lake.
Much like the first film the acting is not great, and almost everybody from this movie is only known for this movie. I'm not trying to complain, because these movies are so entertaining and are from the 80's, but there are movies from the 80's that have great acting in them.
There are more things in this movie that I liked than what I didn't like. It's still entertaining as hell, but I just wish Jason was as big and scary as he is in the newer films. Hindsight is 20/20 and that's what they build towards in future films, so I can't really complain too much. These movies aren't scary at all. I will say that much. I know there supposed to be scary, but instead of being a scary slasher flick, they went for more of a cheesy route and I love it more for it.
Overall, it's cheesy entertainment and if you don't like super cheesy slasher film than you should probably skip it.
2.5/5",Friday the 13th Part 2
172,FKDZ,A Big Improvement!,7,21 August 2020,"So to get right to it this movie is just a massive remaster of the first one, but so much better and so much more interesting.The history of the first movie is still in here, even with almost the full final scene of the first movie, but it seems a bit overkill with the first movie only being released the year before, it would still be pretty fresh in people's memories. Ginny's dialog in the bar would give enough backstory to fill that gap already for new viewers who missed the first movie.First off I want to focus on the characters, big improvement, most of them are likable except for the odd creep that is Scott. The acting is a bit better than the first as well, not amazing, but better. Most notably though Amy Steel does a great job. The introduction of Amy Steel as a rational and smart character was great. Not taking a nap like Alice when everyone is missing which was just a really odd character decision. Talking about Alice, she dies in the opener sequence of the movie. I like some things they did, the shower curtain scene was a fun gimmick they pulled. That said, her death wa a bit meh, seeing a random(?) head in her fridge and then a screwdriver to the side of the face was just a bit tame for the character that killed Jason's mother. Especially now that Jason isn't that dumb as he set up that rope trap for Scott to fall in.The movie is just a repeat of the first, but I was more entertained than the original, even though I knew these characters would get killed one by one (or two) after each other again.They also killed the ''you're doomed'' guy but imo his death was lame and he could've been used in a smarter way instead of creeping on some characters making out. Maybe give him some backstory or anything really..The music was pretty much just as good as the first one. I especially like the police officer chasing Jason sequence.Ginny was definitely the highlight of this movie though. Her psychology background (and general cleverness) used in the end sequence in which she is able to command Jason acting as his mother is so tense. Of course Jason sees his mother's head and he knows he's being fooled but Paul to the rescue and FINALLY Ginny doesn't stand there in shock like in the first attack (although she was keen enough to point out someone was in the room) but actually attacks Jason putting him down (for a bit).The directing is a bit better too, still some shaky stuff here and there but no more awkward long takes and weird cuts. It's a lot more solid all around. BUT I don't know why but there was a bit too much obsession with the uh... female body parts. At times feeling like I was watching some creep record random women. It really could've done without but its a slasher so...eh, it's part of the (80s) genre I guess. There were some awesome scenes though, like when Ginny enters the Jason's shack and you see Jason running towards it through a window and right until he gets close Ginny notices. Also the last scene where Jason goes through the window, I have a hard time deciding if this or the scene in the first movie was better. I think the ''river monster'' looked a lot creepier than the disfigured man we had here. But that leads me to another point, We get to see Jason! I think his look through most of the movie is great with just a white cloth bag and some farmers clothes. His face reveal, I mean it's still creepy, but it's more elephant man level of creepy than scary. But it depends on the person I guess.Also now that I think about it, not all characters we see at the meeting at the start of the movie die. I don't know the names but the black guy definitely didn't. Don't know where they went (the bar?) And Ted, in his drunken stupidity actually survives by not going back?! That's pretty great but he wasn't ever mentioned again, so the movie kinda forgot about him it feels like.Now the kills, it's tough because we had some great effects in the first and I think it's the reason why it's so great. The axe to the face, arrow through the throat were good in particular. There were also two memorable ones here: the machete to the face and then rolling off the stairs (which was kinda funny too) and the POV of the Knife when Vickie meets her end. On kills I guess I'd give Part 2 a slight higher rating but not by much.Now Part 2 ends exactly the same as the original, which is cool burt this ending left me more confused/open ended than the first. Which keeps room for another sequel but just like the original doesn't give a fully satisfying end. Also, Paul is just gone (unexplained) and Muffin was suddenly alive? That said, that could've been a part of Ginny's dream/hallucinations.On the topic of Muffin, just a funny thing about some odd character writing is that Terry never really cares about finding Muffin? She cares more about lunch and going for a walk/swim at night than caring about her dog which is a bit sad. Also Sandra at the start of the movie when they stop in front of a tree on the road said ''This is spooky'''and then starts to wander alone into the forest...hmmm.All in all I really enjoyed this. And I look forward to Part III! 7/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
173,Breumaster,No Burner!,4,5 February 2020,"It's one sequel of many of this series and wasn't good. Long winded and playing with stereotypes. Simply a not good, old ""horror"" movie.

No recommendation! The first was the origin and better.",Friday the 13th Part 2
174,NerdBat,A little more refreshing,6,17 February 2018,"Well, I have to hand it to them, this one captured my attention a lot more than the original film. While it's quite obvious they didn't necessarily plan it as much, the use of abstract craziness makes it a lot more watchable. I noticed in one scene, a woman's throat is cut with the back of the machete. That was funny, seeing as that side of a machete isn't sharp. There was also a weird scene where a woman is hiding from Jason under a bed, and begins urinating for..seemingly no reason other than the fact she sees a rat under the bed with her and may be frightened by it. I'm not a big fan of rats either, but to begin peeing on myself out of the blue seems a bit much. Overall though it was definitely a watchable and enjoyable movie. It makes me feel a bit better about watching the rest of these in the future.",Friday the 13th Part 2
175,ryangilmer007,Jason & Fridays in General,5,7 May 2000,"OK, this film is old, there are a never ending string of sequels (including a new one where Jason is in space), this one is not even the original, and the series really should have ended with part 4, (but...) aside from those facts, the original ""Jasoned"" Friday is still an interesting idea with a few good scares (probably a couple more than the original of the series), lots of gore, nude...etc... This movie and the series pales in comparision to the Halloweens and Nightmares, simply because all of these movies seem to be the same (and hence all of these comments seem to be the same, with minor differences, get the irony?--> love that irony). Anyway, The story-line does not transition from movie to movie with ease. True, this one along with the others in Parts 1-4 had transitions, but 1-4 use flashback scenes (not cinematic). Then 5-9 skipped the transitions (using flashback scenes to connect to Jason's grave or pre-original movie) and with minor exceptions the later movies do not have (major) related story lines (even Jason (or his mother) disappears in the 5th (in reality) and 9th (basically) ones and he is the main guy).Anyway, this is one of the best in the series (top 5 anyway) because it was the first to don-Jason and it thus does have something to set it apart from the rest (but still not the best).In general, While none of the Friday's are terrible (5 and 9 probably being the worst), none of them are tense or suspensful or anything more than the routine slashing and killing. Part 3-D has juiced up music, but the same story. Part 8 has a new story twist, but no new music,etc... The better ones in the series add something (like strip monopoly, or Jason with hockey mask, or 3D, or a claustrophobic environment of a boat), but none of them seem to put it all together in one film.As horror goes, better than average, a good series, but not one of the greats.In general nothing special.Rating wise, one and two are on par.On a one-to-one basis, Part 2 does seem like a remake of part one (rather than just a sequel), but this cannot really be helped if the story line is ""killer stalks in woods to kill campers staying at (or nearby) the lake where mother (or son) died"".  So really only part 1 or 2 is a necessity to see (so pick your poison:  ""Strip monopoly (part 1) or Jason gets his mask (part 2)"".",Friday the 13th Part 2

It's all a bit sanitised and tame.even the final girl get rescued by her night in shining armour.I suppose it's worth watching for the novelty value but I've had breakfasts more scary than this.",Friday the 13th Part 2
177,LuboLarsson,Jason takes centre stage,7,2 February 2009,"*** MAJOR SPOILERS *** After Jason's startling appearance at the end of the first Friday the 13th he takes over where his mother left off in this great sequel to the horror classic. Friday the 13th Part 2 is a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine, its by no means great film making but its sure as hell an entertaining slasher movie. A new camp has opened near Camp Blood from the original and Jason Voorhees is after the blood of the councillor's and teenagers that have arrived for the summer. Its all very unoriginal and its the usual mix of teenagers smoking dope and having sex and being bumped off one by one by the hooded (no hockey mask yet) serial killer. What lifts this above the usual slasher fare is some inventive kills and some great ""jump"" scenes. I actually also think Jason looks better with the hood than the hockey mask, it looks more chilling to me somehow. The acting bar the main couple is the usual Friday the 13th standard i.e amateurish but Amy Steel makes a very strong heroine arguably the best of the series. The last twenty minutes of the movie is an incredibly tense and exciting chase scene and has some of the best moments of the entire franchise. Recommended for horror fans.",Friday the 13th Part 2

Jason comes to avenge his mother's death in killing the next few counselors that come near Crystal Lake.I think Friday the 13th Part II is a better sequel and a better film than the original one and for good reason. Jason Voorheas is finally the killer the story flows like the original with the creepy, quick deaths, jump scares and great music. The Plot goes into great depth about why Jason kills the consolers and what he gets out of it.

179,TheRadiobox,Jason cometh,2,28 July 2020,"Friday the 13th Part 2 was directed by Steve Miner, written by Ron Kurz, and stars Amy Steel, John Furey, Kirsten Baker, Stuart Charno, Marta Kober, Tom McBride, Bill Randolph, Russell Todd, Lauren-Marie Taylor, Warrington Gillette, and Adrienne King. It follows a new series of victims at a new camp near Crystal Lake as they are stalked and picked off by a new, unknown assailant.Plotting is dismal, as is expected for a movie of the Friday franchise. After the murders at camp Crystal Lake the last survivor, Alice (King), is killed by someone new. Five years later, a school for camp counselors is opened close to the old site by Paul and assistant Ginny (Furey and Steel), and attended by Terry, Ted, Sandra, Mark, Jeff, Vickie, and Scott (Baker, Charno, Kober, McBride, Randolph, Taylor, and Todd). The teens and twentysomethings are slowly picked off one by one by a new, unknown enemy. Yeah it's Jason (Gillette). The remaining ones must fight back. Deja vu, anyone?Characters are as bad as would be expected from a Friday movie. None of them have any personality that is worth getting attached to. Ginny is the stock final girl type, only this time the final girl knows child psychology that comes into play when dealing with Jason. There are no other traits than that. Everyone is somehow less than archetypical. Sandra, Jeff, and Paul are nothing characters, Scott is the troublemaker, Terry and Vickie are cute, Ted is a jokester, and Mark is confined to a wheelchair. Great. I don't care. Jason makes his debut, and is somehow the most interesting character; having a sort of back-from-the-dead PTSD that only gets touched on in the end. Other than that, he kills people. Surprising. Performances are bad too, with Steel and Furey being the only ones who feel remotely natural. At least Crazy Ralph is here to give some bizarre line readings. Performances are bad, go figure. uggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh.Scares simply do not exist in Friday 2. Since the characters are basically non-existent and barely acted, there is absolutely no reason to care about what happens to them. Since the movie is a typical slasher-horror, there is no tension, you know what is going to happen. Even though tension could still exist despite a predictable plot, it never materializes, leaving the audience to essentially stare at the exact same movie as the last one. Music is still relied on like a crutch to a cripple, it is overbearing when a kill is about to come; effectively removing the last potential ounce of terror from a script, characters, and plot of a movie that already had nothing to work with. It is a horrible end result.Technically the movie is on the weaker end. Clearly the most effort went into the kills, of which only a handful are decent looking, which makes the ones in the first look masterful. Lighting is pathetic, everything lit like a school play. I guess that makes sense given the crew behind the production but it hardly excuses the mess that is this movie. The music is better than the first, and Jason is a more intimidating villain with an actual presence instead of being merely a POV shot until the end of the movie. Sound design for the kills is odd as well, none of them feel particularly gruesome, which takes even more away from them.Friday the 13th Part 2 is more of the same, with little to differentiate it from the first. It feels more like a remake than the actual remake, sure there was more money thrown at the production, but the end result looks and feels no different. Jason is present, which establishes him as an icon, but the mystery from the first is gone; effectively leaving nothing but a couple kills and some boobs to keep you entertained.26/100",Friday the 13th Part 2
180,monkey-man,Friday The 13th Part 2 Is As Good As The First Movie,6,13 January 2006,2nd movie in my Friday The 13th movie marathon.This movie is the sequel to the good movie Friday The 13th and this movie is as good as the first movie in some ways better but i will always like the first movie a little bit more.The plot for this movie is sort of the same as the first movie and the movies about how its a few years after every one died at camp crystal lake and the camp next door to camp crystal lake is going to open and a new bunch of councilers are setting it up and once again they start to die one by one once again but this time its not Pamela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) killing them its her son Jason Voorhees.There are heaps of great kill scenes in this movie but there are to many to mention and in this movie Jason is not wearing his trade mark hockey mark he is just wearing a white bag with an eye hole in it.Over all if u want to watch a good horror movie with some good gore and kill scenes u should watch this movie.My rating for this movie is six out of ten.,Friday the 13th Part 2

Normally I'm a bit harsh in my reviews but I really have a soft spot for this series along with the Nightmare on Elm Street series.. These films were important in the task of introducting the horror genre as we know it - wannabe followups like Scream and all the other BS cannot follow this, trust me...if you love horror but for some reason missed these films you are in for a treat!I remember this, part 2, as the infamous sequel - you know, sequels fail in 99% of all franchises, but not here. Sure, the sequel is a lot different from the original, the sequel is what started Jason's going bezerk (wherein it was his mother in the original..*SPOILER*) - but I think for once here is a sequel that is fully worthy of its previous film..It is not movie art, granted, but it is great entertainment, especially if you saw them as a kid.....",Friday the 13th Part 2

They could have shown bits, but they just threw in the whole thing. So you could just skip part one and watch this one if you're lazy. A real shame if you ask me. A sequel should only be watched if you have seen it's prequel. In this case you don't have to.What else is there to say? Not much really.

184,shaun98,Average for its type,5,23 April 2002,"[possible spoilers]The success of the ""Friday the 13th"" sequels triggered a wave of other horror sequels, a trend that continues as we speak. Of course, it isn't the first horror franchise by a long shot; there were others in the 1930's, so the 1980's simply saw the revival of an old trend. Of course by that time, film censorship had relaxed considerably.Without further ado, I present, for your consideration, the very first ""Friday"" sequel. Since then, there have been so many that it is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine the original as a stand-alone film.
As slasher movies go, ""Friday the 13th, Part 2"" is strictly average. It's not the worst of its kind, but that barely means anything. It's an uninspired rehash of the original. The only major difference is that Jason has replaced his dead mother as the killer. Granted, there are some decent shocks here and there, mostly towards the end, but overall, it's a fairly boring affair. However, I must give it points for having the nerve to rip off Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" With that in mind, I cannot help but ponder the psychological ramifications of the climatic fight scene, which must be seen to be believed. To her credit, Amy Steel makes a fairly sympathetic heroine, although I personally preferred Adrienne King in the original.*1/2 (out of ****)Released by Paramount Pictures",Friday the 13th Part 2

However, he still isn't wearing his trademark hockey mask yet, he runs around wearing what looks an awful lot like a potato sack on his head.This film most certainly didn't win any awards for it's acting, but what can you really expect out a 1980s horror movie? Oh yeah, that's right, plenty of mindless teenagers meeting a grisly end. If that's what you're up for, this movie has it.How Jason went from a weakling child who drowned in Crystal Lake to an unstoppable killing machine after his death is beyond me.

The only memorable scene is one that includes frightening images of the horror icon, Jason Voorhees. Other than that, the movie is a complete bore.

189,jed-estes,A Movie To Live By 2,9,8 August 2006,"Wow a second Friday the 13th in just a little over a year after the release of the first one. I wish I had been alive during this time so I could have seen this and the original and all the subsequent sequels on the big screen. Alas I was not born until 1985 and have only seen Jason x and Freddy Vs Jason through the light of a projector bulb. This film however is a little less impactive then it's predecessor. This film was rushed and it shows. The dialog is the worst in the series and this includes the fifth installment when I say this. It looks as if when Miner was told he was to direct this he only had like a week to cast because this cast seems as if they don't have clue. Amy Steele is the only one shows any sign of comprehension to the script. She is a lovely successor to Adrianne King who does reprieve her role here, if only for short time, making her inly the forth actor in the series to do so, so far. Steele however works well with what she is given (not much). All she is able to do is run and scream. Her speech about Jason's past in the bar scene is marvelous. That is the only insight we are given about Jason in this film and that is what holds this and the next installment back. The film should have delved into the Jason mythology and now it would be harder for the current directors to screw it up. Miner himself is a incompetent director who takes liberties with characters that are not his own, even if it is against the fans wishes. This is most evident in his film Halloween H-2-0 where he only works to the lowest common denominator of people. That being teeny boppers and jocks. The earliest signs of what is come from Miner can be seen in this film. He chooses not to tie up any of the plot threads of the previous Friday and leave it to other directors.

Amy Steel does a good job in the lead. the best part of the movie though is Jason he is wearing a pillow case over his head, with a part cut out so he can see. for some reason when i watch this movie i get freaked out why i don't know. the one bad thing about the movie is John Furey who plays Paul at the end he is nowhere to be found so we don't know if Jason killed him or not. a very good follow up good for a few good scares, and Steve Miner did a great job as the director, i give the movie 7/10. a must see for any horror fan or friday the 13th fan",Friday the 13th Part 2

195,The-Social-Introvert,The Body Count Continues (and so does my boredom),5,24 October 2016,"Friday the 13th: Part II, for some reason, decides to spend the opening seven minutes recapping the events of the first film via a dream from Alice, the only survivor from the group of campers from the first film. It's bad enough that I had to sit down and watch the bland and boring F13 let alone have it recapped for me. The summary includes Jason popping out of the lake in the end (which is a confusing mistake because of certain events later on). After she awakens in her apartment, she spends the next couple of minutes being scared by phone calls, cats and other stuff before being unceremoniously bumped off. We later come to find that her killer is the kid Jason who drowned in Camp Crystal Lake all those years ago.Now pondering on just how Jason, who we'll find out to be quite a doofus, managed to track down Alice is one thing, but we must first ask ourselves just why the hell is he not a decomposing sludge of flesh at the bottom of a lake? So did he not die all those years ago, and fake his death? If so, why was his mother seeking revenge? Or did he die and then come back to life? But then why was he a kid in the final scene in F13 Part 1 and a grown man in this film? The only explanation is that the jump scare sequence in the first movie was a dream sequence. But that still doesn't explain just why this guy decided to start prancing around killing people. Unless of course it's revenge for his mother's death. But wouldn't the two have met somewhere down the line and Mrs. Voorhees would see that her son wasn't dead? Then why was she seeking revenge in the first place? Unless he was hiding from her too, and he didn't drown all those years ago, instead managing to escape the lake and p*** off into the woods?Argh. I've spent more brainpower trying to decipher the absurdity of F13: 2 than the ambiguity of 2001 or Mulholland Dr combined. The truth is that the people who worked on the first film never intended for Jason to become a villain nor had any thoughts for a sequel. The guys who made this film decided to do just that and ran with the idea, but never actually explained it in any of the sequels, I've been told. At least the Halloween movies had that thorn cult thing and the Freddy Kruger films told us why a normal man was able to go into the dreams of children. Come on Miner, this is just not on.If you can accept Jason's return (and judging by this franchise' box office returns, people did) then F13: 2 still does not make for compelling viewing. You see, everything that I've talked about in the first paragraph happens in the first 10 minutes or so and the movie is 1 hour 26 minutes long. That leave just a little over an hour for the actual story to take place. And it's just the same as the first film – a group of horny teenagers are camping near the lake for whatever reason (these lot are a bunch of trainee councilors or something), dick about for a while and have some dull conversations with each other. Every so often, we're spared another agonizing discussion about who-bloody-cares because anyone who goes for a wee alone is taken out by an 'unknown' stalker. Then, a female is chased for about 15 minutes and apparently kills her stalker and she lives happily ever after, but not before we a gifted with a cheap jump scare which apparently is a dream sequence. Wham. Bam. I feel I've been ripped off, ma'am. That was the setup of both this film and the first one and the world of the internet tells me the sequels are no different. Oh joy.It wouldn't be so bad if there was actually some talent behind or in front of the camera. The actors are a bunch of charisma-free wooden planks and the long, boring and overused POV shots of Jason doin' a bit of the ol' window-peeping feel like they go on forever. They're also accompanied endlessly with that irritating 'Kill kill kill' score played on a loop. The director must've either thought he was expertly building up tension (spoiler alert: he wasn't) or needed to pad out scenes in order to justify a theatrical-worthy runtime. Not to mention the ultra slow-mo in scenes that are supposed to be frantic, and yet kill any possible tension.When F13: 2 isn't boring you to sleep it's ripping off better films, like Mario Bava's A Bay of Blood with two scenes: one where two people are impaled with a spear while they're banging away in bed, and another where a woman decides to get naked and swim in the middle of a bloody creepy-ass lake in the middle of the night in the cold for no bloody reason.There's no style. There's no draw. There's no signature that makes me think ""Yes – That is Friday the 13th and that is why I watch these movies."" Neither of the films I've seen have had the atmosphere of Halloween, the class of A Bay of Blood, the grittiness of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or the furious nature and inventiveness of A Nightmare on Elm Street. So what's the appeal? A few cheap jump scares and watching teenagers get killed one by one? Sorry, that's not for me.",Friday the 13th Part 2

A recent viewing of this classic sequel provided this reviewer with a much needed refresher course in Camp Blood trivia. Part 2 has a lot going for it. Most notably, it is a nice look at the beginnings of a horror cult icon in his heyday.While many of the killings in Part 2 go unseen or unbloodied, there are a few goodies that work nicely. We get a great psychological profile into the mind of Jason, which proves to be quite compelling indeed. Solid scripting, great production design and some good acting help this sequel to work masterfully. And although I have always been a long supporter of the hockey mask, there is just something truly dreadful (in a good and scary way) about seeing Jason run around with a burlap sack over his head.This is the young, impressionable, hillbilly Jason... a character whose anger, rage, and depravity make him hard not to love. ;-) It's all very creepy ...and very effective!!

198,josephbrando,The Best in the Classic-Slasher Series!,10,12 July 2002,"Though very similar in feel to the original, ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" surpasses its predecessor with the scariest and most frenetic entry in the series. Picking up right where Part One left off, Part Two opens with the counselor who survived the rampage of Mrs. Voorhees - only to find herself the very first victim of her grown-up son Jason. Flash forward five years and there are a new batch of counselors setting up camp on Crystal Lake. Jason, looking very creepily in this film like a real person instead of a zombie, dispatches of his victims in a variety  of creative methods and at a nice steady pace. Instead of his trademark hockey mask, Jason is wearing a burlap bag tied around his head with a hole cut over one eye. He looks scarier and more realistic in this film.Amy Steel gives a great performance as ""the final girl"" in one of the longest and scariest chase scenes of all the Fridays. Part Two has a good combination of edge-of-your-seat suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shocks. The only part of this film that really cheeses out is when our heroine pretends to be Jason's mother (and Jason believes it), but this is a small price to pay for the excellent scares and surprises that abound in ""Friday the 13th Part 2"".Because of all the commotion caused by the release of ""Friday the 13th"", the ratings board was extra-tough on the sequal and most of the gory scenes were either trimmed or removed all together.

199,legendaryunderdog,Just as good as the original,9,12 July 2007,"Director Steve Miner brought a new life to the original Friday the 13th with this first sequel. Sean S.

Five years after the initial bloodbath at Crystal Lake, a counselor-training facility is opened up just down the lake aways from the old campsite where Jason's mother went on a killing rampage, and like before, still unwilling to heed the words of Crazy Ralph, the counselors-in-training are stalked one by one by a mysterious individual/psychopath. Manfredini's score is just as good as the original, bone-chilling violins screeching and whatnot. The myths of the Jason legend come to rest in this installment in the Friday series. The pace for this film moves a lot quicker than the first, possibly one (of many) reason(s) why this film will not attain a rating like it's predecessor, although I believe it should rank just as high as the original. Very underrated slasher, definitely deserves as much praise as the first film. 9/10 stars.",Friday the 13th Part 2
200,Jerry Ables,Genuinely entertaining sequel,10,8 October 2001,"I truly think that this film is a very worthy sequel to what is very easily one of the best of the teen slasher films of its era.  It offers more of the creepy fun and excitement that made its predecessor such a delight to watch. If you're a fan of slasher genre, I recommend this movie to you because I think that watching it is movie time very well spent.",Friday the 13th Part 2
201,Mattswife97,Not to bad of a sequel.,10,11 December 2002,"The reason why nobody knows what happened to Paul in the end is because that little pussy walked out while the film was still filming. He probably was afraid of the big bad boogyman. The hell with Paul, what happened to the guy who stayed at the bar?  You know, the funny one who had his friend's truck tow in the beginning as a joke.  He cracked me up everytime he was on screen. In the very beginning of the movie Alice,the first and only survivor in the first one has dreams about what happened in the first movie and no sooner finds a head in her refrigerator, she screams, and then gets an icepic in the head.  Did notice how the boiling water covered up her scream? Flash forward to 5 years later where Jason is an adult (remember folks, he was born in 1950 something so he's not a little kid like some of you dimwits think) where there is a different camp opening up across the lake. Here we have fresh meat. I just want to know one other thing, what the hell is a cripple doing in the woods? I think they need counselors who can walk in case of emergency. I loved how he died though. The camera kept changing angles so you never know when, where, or how the crippled is going to die. That must have been scary to go down a flight of stairs in a wheelchair. Good old stunt people, putting their lives in danger for our entertainment. I thought Jason looked really creepy with that bag over his face.  You have to watch this movie. Not as good as it could have been, but at least it is much better than some of the sequels. 10 stars",Friday the 13th Part 2
202,reverendtom,One of the Best in the Series,8,3 April 2004,"This is one of the all around best in the Jason series, and I think it is because the evolution of Jason is apparent in this film more than in any of the others. Jason is still ""alive"" in this one and he has hair.  He's ugly as hell, that's for sure, but he apparently hasn't been killed yet, so he isn't the nasty zombie of the later films.  In this one he is decidedly more human.  He is also way smarter, and in one of the film's laughable plot holes, he uses quite a bit of his cognitive capacity.  He finds the girl that he pulled into the water at the end of the first one, like finds her house.  He also calls her on the phone.  This means he must have used the phone book!  Good for you, Jason. 'Attaboy. He also apparently built a shack to live in and look at his dead mamy's head in.  He also had candles burning in his house, so he must've gone to Yankee Candle or something. He's faster and uses better tactics in this film than in any others, except part 3.  After part 3 he becomes the lumbering behemoth that we are more familiar with. Anyway, this is definitely one of the most enjoyable and interesting of the Jason films.  I want to marry the main girl.  She is so smart.",Friday the 13th Part 2
203,Eraser81,Heeeeeeere's Jason!,10,12 February 2003,"Well since Friday the 13th grossed almost 40 million it was almost natural to make a sequel.  So why not bring back Jason, who was thought to of drowned as a child.Jason has to settle for a potato sack in this installment as his mask, but that doesn't stop him from doing some serious slaughtering on the unsuspecting camp counselors.Best segment may be the wheelchair bound man who after meeting a merchedi takes a spill down a flight of stairs.I used to dislike this film, but much like part 3 it can grow on you in time.*1/2/****",Friday the 13th Part 2

But one thing that made me happy was,the Era of Jason began here....My ratings are...Acting- 2.0 / 5.0Actors- 2.5 / 5.0 Script- 3.0 / 5.0 Display-3.0 / 5.0 Gore   -3.0 / 5.0 Suspense-2.5 / 5.0 Music  -2.5 / 5.0 Overall - 2.5 / 5.0   C / C+",Friday the 13th Part 2
205,terrible2,Made my Grandma scream...,7,23 December 2005,"My Grandmother took a school buddy of mine and me to see this one at the theater. She wasn't quite sure what it was about, and we weren't going to tell her. Friday the 13th II, is by far my favorite of the series, for a few reasons: 1. Moms that kill don't scare me. 2. Gratuitous nudity for 13 year olds. 3. Jason is introduced as a murderous zombie. 4. More gratuitous nudity. 5. My Grandma jumped 3 feet out of her seat. Steve Miner directed this one and the 3rd installment (which I enjoyed as well), with Jason Voorhee's at the helm, we know we're in for a ride. The film is an early ""Slasher"" flick, and in my opinion amongst the best, solid story line, dumb teenagers looking to score and an undead guy looking to butcher them (how can we go wrong). Whenever I see this film, I always have fond memories of my Grandma'a high pitched scream and her 80 pound, 4 foot nothing frame leaping out of the theater seat. I asked her about it years later and all she could say was ""Uuuggh""! Camp Crystal Lake will live forever in this cult classic horror romp. Sorry Grandma.",Friday the 13th Part 2
206,G.Spider,"Better than the first, but sadly that's not saying much at all.",2,21 June 1999,"Virtually the only worthwhile parts of this film are the dream sequence at the beginning, the bit in which the local sheriff chases a mysterious figure to its lair and the climax, which takes place in a kind of shrine.  The rest of the film is overloaded with the same mistakes as its predecessor - lack of a proper plot, obnoxious teenagers you couldn't care less about, boring padding and predictable teenage romances (if that's the right word).  This sequel's attempt at a plot doesn't even make sense.  If Jason didn't drown at all then why didn't he just go home to his mother?  The effects in this film are dire (it looks like it was made in about 1970), the music is often below average and the ending, in which Jason seemingly returns, is just muddled and badly-done.",Friday the 13th Part 2
207,tenthousandtattoos,Pleasant surprise...never expected to find it here!,6,29 July 2007,"Of all the schlocky horror movies I'm into, this is the only one that managed to surprise me...so that there is saying something, but let me explain: in revisiting the horror films I grew up with (Re-Animator, Nightmare on Elm St, Halloween, etc) I always knew what to expect. No real scares anymore, but some really good film-making and interesting, if somewhat dated, special FX.Never did I actually expect to be SCARED. But then the final 15 minutes of F13th Part 2 had me on the edge of my seat. Something about Ginny (Amy Steel), all alone, in the dark, and the demented-nature of Jason (very effective hessian-bag thing over his head - genuinely believable as the complete psycho who's been hiding in the woods for a few years) as he pursued her in the cabin and then to his shack in the woods. Highly effective scenes here, as we just see Ginny's terror, and we, as well as she, DO NOT know exactly where Jason is...that really amps up the fear-factor...likewise Amy Steel's performance...I really believed her fear.It's a shame these films went the way they did, descending into silliness and out-staying their welcome, much like the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise - I mean, Freddy started out as ""Fred Krueger"", just a demented sicko child-murderer, which is heaps scarier than the wise-cracking, cartoonish fool he became in the later movies. Likewise, when Jason Vorhees became a superhuman monster who could essentially breathe underwater (even if left there for years on end) he lost that true psycho quality that made him such a frightening killer in this film.To conclude, I absolutely love the setting of this movie...the deserted, (seemingly) peaceful campground...log cabins...a nice lake...picturesque holiday destination if you manage to avoid the machete-wielding madman...my advice is just to stay indoors at night, something most of Jason's victims neglected to do...and you know what happened to them!",Friday the 13th Part 2
208,Mister-Creeper,Jason Is Alive,8,25 August 2007,"OK, so I just watched this movie again the other day. It had been a while since I last saw it. I have to say that I don't like the way Jason was brought back into the movie. There is no real clear answer to this at all throughout the film. I mean, the best you get is that he never drowned and had been living in the woods around Camp Crystal Lake. So if he never drowned, then just why did his mother kill all those people? Doesn't make much sense to me, I mean, unless they want to make you believe that his body was never found and his mother just assumed he was dead and decided to take revenge. Anyways, I think they could have come up with something better...Now, I won't complain too much more because Part 2 did help create one of the best slasher movie series of all time. So on with the show...We start out with the only survivor from Part 1 having a dream. It flashes back and forth from the ending of Part 1 to her in bed squirming around. So we get a little reminder of what happened at the conclusion of Part 1. ...and we know what is about to happen at the beginning of Part 2.The rest of the film focuses on some camp counselors staying at another camp across the lake from the original Camp Crystal Lake. We get introduced to the characters and the acting is fairly good. There are few characters that we really care for (maybe 3 at the most). You don't see Jason until close to the end of the movie, I mean, his face. All the kills earlier in the movie all you see is part of his body and his weapon. They took this angle from Part 1, IMO trying to create a doubt that it was actually Jason doing the killing. It could have easily been someone else...Part 2 is not a bad follow-up to the original, although it of course could have been better. I was pretty satisfied with the acting. Jason, as an adult, was introduced and ultimately became an 80's household name for slashers. The bag over his head with the eye-holes cut out was not scary at all. I'm glad they improved that with Part 3, and created an image of Jason that has terrified little kids to this very day! I give this film a 6 out of 10. It's nothing spectacular, but it did give life to the adult Jason, even if the way they did it was not believable at all...",Friday the 13th Part 2
209,nightwatch4773,The best of the entire series....,9,26 March 2013,When I first watched this film in 1982 I just loved it. This might have something to do with my love for the film The Town that Dreaded Sundown. Those burlap sacks are dam creepy but as the sequels kept piling up and the hockey mask was introduced slowly this film was sliding down my top Friday's but as I have gotten older my love and appreciation for this sequel simply states that this is the best Friday the 13th to date. The acting also in this film is by far the best of the entire series and Amy Steele as the heroine wins by a landslide. This is also the only Friday the 13th that displays full frontal female nudity and the only sequel with Jason with the burlap sack. Part 3 goes for a slightly more campy direction which I felt was the first slip in the series.,Friday the 13th Part 2
210,jeffy-3,Recommended for Several Choice Jolts,4,28 August 2000,"Sure there's no real plot, a lot of the acting is embarrassing and the dialogue will make you cringe, but there are at least five great jolts that had me jumping in my seat. It's probably better than the original only in that there really aren't as many good scares in the predecessor. Incidentally, I remember reading that they actually filmed the double impaling scene but were forced to cut it to get an R rating.  I wish Paramount would restore the footage for DVD.",Friday the 13th Part 2
211,veryape-887-913905,Jason has arrived,7,29 January 2014,"Just when you thought it was safe to go back into camp... here's even more heart-pounding terror. Five years after the horrible bloodbath at Camp Crystal Lake, all that remains is the legend of Jason Voorhees and his demented mother, who had murdered seven camp counsellors. At a nearby summer camp, the new counsellors are unconcerned about the warnings to stay away from the infamous site. Carefree, the young people roam the area, not sensing the ominous lurking presence. One by one, they are attacked and brutally slaughtered. Suspense and screams abound in this compelling thriller.This film stars: Amy Steel, John Furey & Adrienne King This film is better than the first film and it's 100% because of Jason, whoever played Jason was fantastic in this film I don't know if they changed the actor of Jason in the other sequels but if they did this Jason just shows all the others up with how good he is. I do recommend this film to fans of the first film and fans of horror films.***/***** good film",Friday the 13th Part 2

214,theterminator-92378,Jason's start to a blood filled franchise,6,26 October 2017,Jason Voorhees first movie with some impressive kills and would show the start of a slasher powerhouse who was more of a bumbling idiot with a sack over his head then a killer who would scare you to death but this was his first outing so it was still good to go back to the basics of slashers. there was a large cast of characters who were all camp councilors in training most notably Ginny the final girl played by Amy Steel her character uses her child psychology against Jason and it becomes important to stop Jason. There was many call backs to the original movie and the intro into the movie is a follow up to the end of the movie and we get to see a special appearance from Alice the final girl from the first movie it was also nice to see the return of MRS Voorhees well her head at least. overall it was an enjoyable movie in the franchise and it comes very close to being as good as the original although it still was different and the start of something amazing.,Friday the 13th Part 2
215,TheMichaelMyersMovieFanatic,The Second Friday - Horror Reviews,9,15 November 2019,"I infact really enjoyed the first film and by now it's one of my favourite horror movies, and of course I was interested to see Jason in action. So what did I think?Review:
Let's start talking about the cons. This movie is bloodier than the first one, giving us more kills directly on-screen. Then we have Jason, he's a pretty good killer in this movie even though I wouldn't consider him as good as Michael Myers in the 1978 classic or Chucky in Bride of Chucky. The main character is ok aswell. The start scene is chocking as the ""Revenge of Jason Vorhees"". What they did with ""Crazy Ralph"" was suprising aswell. But kicking off my sins is that this movie felt pretty mutch exactly the same as the first movie but not performed as great. They hide the killer and the identity of the main character, just like the first movie for an example. Then I thought that there were a lot of stuff that was left unclear, like if a character survived at the end, and the rat scene. And finally, the atmosphere wasn't as effective or strong as the one that the original had.Final:
I'll give it a 6/10, it's a solid sequel. I recommend every slasher fan to check out all four original movies, including this one!",Friday the 13th Part 2
216,DorianWynHowells,Same plot outline. Same location. Different killer!!,6,22 January 2002,"It's a sad fact that this sequel more or less has the exact same plot structure as the genre-bending original. I mean, it even has the same feel to it. Even the ending! Oh well...After the initial shock ending of the original film, this film begins with the demise of the last surviving victim. The build up and the atmosphere is used to great effect. This is one opening sequence that holds your attention. When the character finally meets her demise, we know it isn't Mrs Voorhees, so it must be...Jason! So he IS alive. Cool.Yeah...cool! Or so I thought.The director, has done the greatest mistake of all time, making a sequel that makes you feel as though you are watching the original, because it's more or less like a carbon copy!!Don't get me wrong, this isn't a worse film because of it, it's just sooooooo predictable. I second-guessed every death in this film!!!! Every one??!!! Come on, there must be something wrong somewhere!!What would have probably made a great sequel is if the film was shot using a different style. And new build-up music would have helped too. Maybe the budget was so low, he couldn't afford a new soundtrack!Yes, the new students all get killed, and yes they die very quickly and easily, not putting up much of a fight. Same-o-same-o!!!The development of Jason's psychological unbalance is a nice addition, and serves to try and develop him, and give him some justification for his killings. He and his mother were VERY close, (probably bordering on Oedipus related problems!!) and we see this bond towards the end of the film.Jason's disfigurement is hinted at, (maybe it's the sack over his head that gives it away?!!) and we as an audience want to see what he looks like. There's nothing more frustrating to an unsuspecting audience, than never really seeing the killer in a horror film, and come the climax, we are satisfied. Kind of anyway.The ending? Just watch the first film and it's more or less exactly the same. More or less.So another sequel? Yep.Could have been better, but then again, it could have been MUCH worse.Same score 6/10.I would say enjoy, but I can't bring myself to say it here.",Friday the 13th Part 2
217,DJ_Shilo,Blood Money,1,2 May 2020,"The body count continues with ""Friday the 13th Part II,"" a depressing geek show that only exists to show very violent mayhem. How do you make a sequel when the cast of the previous film are all dead? You have a character that got only mentioned in the original and very much dead, and you bring him to life because the producers smell money. The original was not a great film by any means. Still, It did have an interesting story about vengeance and a twisted ending that was unexpected and quite a surprise; The sequel is the same movie with a high body count but zero intelligence.It's about another summer camp reopening, and the counsellors in the night are stalked and killed by an unseen killer. With the legend of Jason Voorhees looming, the camp counsellors try to escape the madness and stay alive through the night.In the original film, a lunatic mother went on a rampage and killed a slew of teens at a summer camp called Camp Crystal lake. She went berserk because, 35 years before, her son drowned in the lake because of incompetent camp counsellors. In the end, she got decapitated by lone survivor, Alice (Adrienne King). I defended ""Friday the 13th"" on the grounds that it had a story, likeable characters, and a sort of murder mystery with red herrings and the end being a surprise as to who the killer was. Most of all, the violence wasn't without a purpose. Some of it was gruesome, and some were off-screen, but audiences only saw the violence in the film, and it's what got the film quickly condemned. Well, for people who show up for this film they are only attending for extreme violence and not much else. What does that tell you?
The legend of Camp Crystal Lake continues as it seems the son, Jason Voorhees, didn't drown in the lake. He survived and lurked around in the woods. I guess now he wants vengeance against camp counsellors for killing his mother. Alice survived the original nightmare, and it opens with her in her home, alone somewhere, and a mysterious figure has found her. You're not supposed to know it is Jason, and the screenwriter incompetently thinks that you don't know that already so he can be kept a surprise until the end. There's no thought here, so who else would it be? Anyway, the camera follows her around as she undresses, talks on the phone, she hears a weird noise in the kitchen, and our mysterious assailant drives an ice pick through her temple. Alice was a good character, and she is reduced to a cameo here so that she can get killed. I checked out of the movie after seeing this.A batch of new counsellors show up to the Camp for training, and the heroine this time is named Ginny (Amy Steele). Ginny gets briefly introduced before everyone decides to take off for a beer, and the others stay behind to play around with each other. Our mysterious assistant prowls around the Camp, and one by one, he picks off the kids. We only ever see him in shadow as a machete gets sunk into a kid's head that causes his wheelchair to crash backwards down a set of stairs in the pouring rain. Another sequence has a boy and girl having sex, and he skewers them with a spear through the bed. After everyone gets killed in very violent ways, the others return, and it's their turn. Sound familiar? Eventually, Jason reveals himself wearing a potato sack over his head and swinging an axe. Big surprise!So apparently Jason is portrayed as a supernatural character. He never speaks. He's never developed. He lives in a makeshift shack out in the woods and is a killing machine. So this brutal killer has lived in the woods for 35 years, and nobody has ever seen him? A cop spots someone running in the woods and gives chase only to discover a shack, and he gets his head caved in with the claw of a hammer. Once the mayhem starts, its sequence after sequence of the same thing.Paul Holt is the guy who opens the Camp for the characters who are all interchangeable victims. The new Camp is on the shoreline of Camp Crystal Lake. Has anyone discovered the bodies from the first film yet? Five years have passed as the obligatory exposition scene has everyone sitting around a campfire, and Paul tells them all about the legend of Jason, his drowning and how he survived. He grew up living in the woods and kills anybody that comes near the Camp to avenge his mother. Don't start overthinking about it because an idiot ruins the scene in a mask who tries to scare everyone. Paul tells them all, ""Jason is dead.""Paul and Ginny return to the Camp after everyone is dead and are quickly attacked by Jason in the dark. ""Paul, there is someone in here,"" Ginny says. She is a fun character and ends up running through the woods. Eventually, Ginny finds something in Jason's shack, and it's supposed to be a surprise at the end. She realizes Jason is alive after all, and he is the one after her. She gets clever as she attempts to outsmart him, leading to a weird ambiguity because the screenwriters didn't know how to end the film.I was more appalled at how cynical the film was. How depressing it is watching these teenagers get hacked to pieces. I find it more appalling that the original movie got condemned for being violent, and people have no problem showing up for this mindless bloodbath, which is the equivalent of horses going to the glue factory. There is nothing special about the film. It's a cruel, gruesome cyclical story with nothing to show for other than a body count.0/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
218,Jesse-45,Jason on the rampage!!!,10,2 September 1999,"Jason rises from Crystal Lake, starting his blood-soaked reign of terror, he wants vengeance, for what the teenagers (Alive from Part 1, in particular) did to his mother, in the first F13 movie. This is perhaps my second or third favorite Friday The 13th, with a greatly entertaining pre-credits scene and awesome credits scene, with the Friday The 13th title appearing, only to have Part 2 show up in the title. I like Jason, with his hockey-mask the most, but he's pretty cool with the pillow-case. Along with his overalls. The climax of the movie is very exciting!",Friday the 13th Part 2
219,campblood13,A solid sequel to the original.,6,24 December 2003,"Part 2 picks up six months after the original ended.  We then skip ahead five years, to a new camp set up right next to Camp Blood.  Kirsten Baker does the best job as Terri, by getting naked and also wearing tight shorts. The suspense is built up like in no other Friday movie.  I know Crazy Ralph was crazy, but if he was so scared of Camp Blood, why was he walking around in the woods the first night?  Many questions are answered and some remain unsolved to this day.  The second best in the series behind part 1.  6/10  3 stars out of 5",Friday the 13th Part 2
220,TheOldGuyFromHalloween3,Dumbest sequel ever,1,6 June 2020,"So Jason was alive all the time? Did he almost drown then pull himself out of the water? What then? He just decided to go live in the woods for the next 20 years or so. How did he even survive all that time? Just a little retarded kid alone in the woods. And nobody thought to look for him? He was living in a shack just a few hundred yards away from the camp but nobody could find him. Why didn't Jason go back to his mom? Obviously they didn't expect to make any sequels or they wouldn't have killed off Betsy Palmer
And after he kills a cop nothing. IRL the woods would've been swarming with cops looking for their co-worker. And why would they start a new camp so close to the one where everyone was slaughtered 5 years before? On the same lake. Was that little No Trespassing sign supposed to keep them safe from serial killers? This movie wasn't well thought out at all. Also the final girl was very plain and a poor actress. She looks like the lead singer of Motley Crue. The only positive is John Furey gives a decent performance.",Friday the 13th Part 2
221,ChrisTreborn,"Jason-Entry 1: ""Essential Chapter But. Those 80's Horror Thrillers SUCKS !""",1,26 May 2005,"Am a new great fan of Jason Voorhees, I first saw his movie ""Jason X"" and I hated it, but when I saw ""Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives"" followed with ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" I became interested in Jason character. After a long time I got the chance to see the 2nd chapter of the franchise.Friday the 13th Part 2 (Spoilers******) Produced and Directed by Steve Miner tells the continuing story of Crystal Lake locals in his debuting directional venture, this time with a new character Jason, the drowned baby boy of Pamela Voorhees from the original movie.While I am writing this comment I didn't see the first movie which inspired the Paramount studio to do the sequel (I hope it's cool). (In my view since sequels II-III-IV occurs on same continuing periods, they can closely consider as F13th SECOND PART Trilogies!). This movie begins with the footage of the first part which shows the death of Mrs. Pamela Voorhees.Years passed, now the teenage girl Alice who killed Mrs. Voorhees was brutally murdered by unknown man called Jason. When a group of young people came for a camp in the Crystal Lake, the abused childhood Jason began to hunt them down, for the revenge of his mother.Scripted by Ron Kurz marks a new milestone in the Friday series by reinventing Jason for the Cult following adult rated sequels. His vision of Jason as the mentally retard as well as the psychotic smart homicide killer was great for the continuing story. But for me the problem in this movie comes from it's lagging screenplay; it is weak not tightened, each scenes crawls and the camera-work of Peter Stein sucks.With a body count of 10, I didn't like the way of this script's intention to thrill the viewers, or is that because of 80's usual film-making styles. The editing of Susan E. Cunningham sucks a lot when it comes to important scenes. The soul for this movie is given by the previous music director Harry Manfredini, I didn't like or hate his work. The score didn't make an impact except the ""Kiyack..Kicyak..Kicak"" cue.And as for the first Jason ever to appear in Friday 13th: franchise, the work of Francis Warrington Gillette III as matured Jason Voorhees and Steve Daskawisz (or may be Cliff Cudney) as the first Jason stunt double were great. Those fast walking, speed hand draws really marked the beginning of a HORROR ICON.All in all it's a great movie if I would have seen it in my '4 year old age', but hence I saw this crap this month May 2005 ""I give this movie 1 out of 10""!

Stabing her in the head with a screwdriver? That's a great idea. This is just the beginning of the cheesy slasher movies that have no point. The scares are cheep and rip-offs from better horror movies, the script is pure crap, and the acting is about as good as some small guy trying to act like a fat guy. Forget it.

224,pleiades10,Another excellent finale on this early slasher classic.,6,15 August 2000,"Friday the 13th Part 2 is very similar to the original in feel and atmosphere. A little more of the killer is shown throughout the movie this time (stomping through the forest, hiding in the shadows...), but gone is the mystery factor that made the original so great. You know who the killer is within the first few scenes.But that doesn't matter. It's an entertaining horror classic in it's own right, and features the most inventive finale to any of the Friday the 13th movies.",Friday the 13th Part 2
225,jhigginbotham151,Atmosphere goes great with a kick-ass lead,6,12 May 2014,"I really like the atmosphere here. I feel like all the sequels were a lot more like action films in a way, Jason being shown fully in bright light doing his killing. While I love that kind of Jason (Jason X is just kick-ass), but this type of Jason has the Michael Myers vibe, it makes him a lot scarier and more mysterious. This was before the hockey mask kids, before Kane Hodder turned Jason into Horrors Jason Bourne, and before Freddy Kreuger made your nightmares uninhabitable. This is the best Halloween rip-off since Halloween 2.Ginny, god I love her. She's your average nice goody goody two shoes for the entire film and you kind of want her to die because of it, but then she kicks Jason... ready for this... in the nuts, she straight up kicks him in the jingle bells. Thats awesome, she is awesome, her and Kay-Em 14 from Jason X are the most bad-ass girls in the entire series, no doubt. I don't know why but after every death they fade into white, I kind of like it too. It takes you right out of every kill and right back into a scene of nudity or pointless talk. Speaking of death, they kill a guy in a wheelchair in this movie, and its hilarious... I don't know whether to feel bad or just be disguised with myself.The soundtrack is Psycho, well its not, but it sure sounds like it. Does it make the film better?, yes it does, would I have preferred a more original soundtrack?, yes, yes I would have.The acting is actually quite good for a slasher flick, all the characters are written with slightly more depth and you do kind of like all of them but of course, they are all going to die and you are going to enjoy watching them die, marvelous.Overall, I like part 2, its got a really creepy atmosphere that the other films lacked and most of all, It actually had some moments that scared me, mostly jump scares but still.",Friday the 13th Part 2
226,phoenixyk1,A worthy Sequel - A cut above the first,8,28 September 2014,"Well, my Marathon viewing of these classics had to continue with Part 2... And anyone who knows the movies legend finally gets a chance to see Jason Voorhee's in all his glory - Though its will bee some time before he dons the Iconic Hockey Mask he is so well known for.While the film is much the same as the first in its direction and building of suspense, it manages to keep you on your toes.Sadly, more of the same is not always a good thing... And a pattern starts to follow that continues in Slasher Movies to this day. Teenage Victims are all Stoner's with Boners and not an ounce of intellect to speak of.Easily a match for its predecessor, it is once again dated but is a great film none the less. For an early effort in this type of genre, it was worthy of its time.Maybe more character could have been added to make Jason more menacing - But back then it was far from a priority.A must see if you enjoyed the first.",Friday the 13th Part 2
227,MissCzarChasm,Isn't all that great untill the last 15 minutes,6,19 July 2000,"Friday the 13th 2 works on some level mostly because this is the first film that features the Jason character as the killer. He's somewhat menancing but this film suffers from being kind of boring and not nearly as good as the original.The film opens on Alice, the survivor of the original film, still haunted by the events that took place at crystal lake. in the next 5 minutes lets just say she'll won't have to think about it anymore. afew years later a camp site has opened not too far from camp and jason is not to happy with this.It moves kind of slow and known of the characters are really that great except for our herioine ginny. The make up effects are still great and the last 15 minutes do satisfy.As a film of its own it's pretty good, but as a sequel to a so called slasher classic it doesn't really compare",Friday the 13th Part 2
228,The_Wagon,Mildly Realistic,7,7 January 2007,"Everyone has heard of the Friday the 13th series. Jason comes, Jason kills, Jason gets killed, Jason comes back, repeat the process. The first movie in the series featured Jason's mom killing people, and it was a decent movie, but not that great. In the sequel, Jason kills people! He isn't wearing the hockey mask though, he's wearing a bag over his head. Anyway, it's a good movie. It's actually sort of realistic. In the other Friday the 13th films, Jason is like the Hulk. He can't be stopped. If you kick him, he rips your leg off. If you punch him, he breaks your wrist. In this film, you can kick him, and he actually falls down like a real person. There are some cool killings in this, and overall, it's a fun popcorn horror movie. One of the better films in the Friday the 13th series.",Friday the 13th Part 2

230,Cole_Early,"Surprise, surprise...",8,25 June 2007,"Just as good as the first, if not, a BETTER film than the first, I think. It's got all of the expected goods- the sex, the gore, the suspense, and the thrills, as well as the grotesque scenes of bloody carnage. Jason Vorhees, the son of the killer in the original, is back from the grave to kill all that dare defy the warnings of the wise and step foot on Camp Crystal Lake.This sparked the beginning of many, many more sequels, but is just as well as the first, a significantly remember-able film, and one of the best slasher/stalker films ever made. (Especially in the series...)",Friday the 13th Part 2
231,matthewnoorman,Not very good,4,8 October 2020,"I absolutely love horror movies especially classics but the Friday the 13th series is one I just cannot get behind.
Lets start off with the almost non existent plot. From there we get really corny, non convincing performances of poorly written characters and very little suspense which every good horror flick should have. The soundtrack is bland and does little to create any tension (other than the classic ke ke ke, ka ka ka which I love) throughout the film. The victims die from very cliche killings, most of the killings are predictable which takes away all the fright you could possibly get from them. When the victims die they don't give off a realistic sense of fear in their performance, which doesnt allow the viewer to really get a sense of terror. The women have a lot of over the top cliche screams and do little to fight off Jason. They stand there andwatch him come towards them with a knife and they dont run or do anything but wait for him to kill them. Thats unrealistic and dry. Realism is what makes horror movies scary, if it doesn't have any sense of reality it takes away the fear factor. And that is exactly what this film does. This film steps on its on toes.
Listen, I dont expect movies from 40 years ago to deeply scare me. But I do expect them to create suspense and a feeling of tension and unease. Which this sequel and the rest of the sequels fail to do.
Maybe in the 80s this was better than it is now. But most classic horror films are still extremely relevant, Halloween, Omen, Exorsist, Shinning, Nightmare, the universal monster series and many others still hold up today. This one just doesn't.",Friday the 13th Part 2
232,Chris-332,"Not terrible, but still a bad film.",5,11 August 1999,"Okay, I need to admit it. Friday the 13th part 2 is not as bad as the rest of the half-baked, atrocious sequels. But still, it is a bad film. The special effects SUCK! How could they be worse than the first one's if it was made a year later?! Isn't technology supposed to improve over the course of time? But anyway, it does have some decent killing scenes, but no where near the marvelous ones in the original, which was a great movie. The acting is horrible, but I expected that. One thing I was SO surprised at, which got me REALLY mad, was the fact that Jason didn't find the notorious hockey mask 'till the third film! It's bad enough that Jason has controlled the franchise even though he wasn't in the first one! Now he doesn't gain his symbol 'till the third film?! And they could have done it a little better then putting a bag over his head. Oh well, I have to give it some credit because it did a better job than some of the atrocious last sequels like 6, 7, 8, and the laughable 9.",Friday the 13th Part 2
233,LT-10,Great Slasher Flick,10,18 August 2003,"This one has got all the things that make up a fun slasher flick. Pointless nudity + pointless sex + blood-o-rama +cheap scares. All in all I was more entertained by this one than the original. I also like how it was the perfect length for a thriller, it didn't get tiresome. It's hard to make these types un-predictable, but they've avoided that here to my surprise. My only complaint is the ending, I didn't get it. Maybe its cleared up in #3? Anyways, See it for some scares! 8/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
234,helencmm,Better than the original.,7,7 September 2019,"This film is definitely a good sequel, in my opinion, better than the original for many reasons that I'm going to mention.Firstly, I want to say that I can't review it as ""a cliché film"", because of course before watching this one, I've seen many other slashers, especially the ones that came out '90s and '00s. ""Part II"" came out in 1981, so it's obvious which films are cliché and which are authentic. There is no parthenogenesis in art.""Part II"" is way better than the original film, because it contained way more action than its predecessor, it was bloodier, it was more thrilling and we had a grownup Jason. We also had a very strong and clever final girl. I like that she really fought for her life and used as her weapon her knowledge of paedopsychology. It was very unique move. I've seen final girls in similar themed films, even in this franchise, that eventually survive very randomly. They don't use their brain. They use their instinct. Ginny used her brain. She had some practical weapons, but also her study one, which helped her to manipulate Jason for a bit. I think it's memorable enough to be an important step of ""how to defeat Jason"" in the videogame. I really enjoyed the final chase scene. It was thrilling, scary enough, and most important, we had a human Jason. Humans can be hurt, so do Jason.I've found all the characters likeable and the makeup effects were great. Also, the acting was better than the original. It was not great, but slightly better. In some parts the film was quiet boring.Overall, we talk about a very good and memorable continuity. One of the best, in my opinion, of the franchise. It'll not disappoint you if you're a fan of the subgenre.***REVIEW UPDATE***
I want to mention something really important. My overall view of this film still stays positive, but some things are meant to be said.Although I said that there's no parthenogenesis in art, this film has copied some of its most important (death) scenes, in such a way, that is a crime.They copied almost exactly scenes from the prior Italian giallo film ""Ecologia del delitto"" (1971) (A.K.A. ""A Bay of Blood"") by Mario Bava.It's not bad to have an inspiration of another film, but not to copy it in such a high degree. Credits are meant to be given.American directors of the ""slasher"" genre were copying many ""giallo"" films, so if you want to watch some pure similar films, go watch some authentic Italian giallos by Argento, Bava, etc. And then the American ones.Again, I liked this film, and the rating will not change, but I don't like replica.",Friday the 13th Part 2
235,horrormb,Scream 2 was wrong! Sequels aren't crap!,9,24 February 1999,"This movie was, in my opinion, more thought out and creepier than the original.  It showed less of the killer and the fact that he couldn't talk was pretty chilling when he went after people.  I think the scene where Vickie gets stabbed could possibly be seen as a take-off from ""Psycho"" but the fact that she just stood there was something which I deem stupid.  I didn't like seeing the guy in the wheelchair get killed but I can understand it (although I'm still trying to explain to some others).  The only main thing that I didn't like was that this fell into step with the others (Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street) when it could've become something totally different.  I gave it an 8 out of 10.",Friday the 13th Part 2
236,horrormb,The creepiest by far....,9,26 March 1999,Many of the Fridays (and many other movies) can not live up to the suspense and atmosphere of Part 2.  This one was fun to watch since it was heavier on the suspense than the gore (unlike many other ones).  I guess there isn't too much else to say.  A definite nine out of ten.,Friday the 13th Part 2
237,Duzniak38,Jason's Debut,10,2 August 2006,"Friday the 13th Part II. This movie is a very decent sequel, which provides all of the essentials that Friday the 13th delivered. Therefore, it isn't very unique or different in comparison to it's original. The soundtrack is still the same, which is not exactly a bad thing, as the music was an vital part of what made Friday the 13th more tense and exciting. Friday the 13th Part II starts it's carnage by killing off the survivor of the original, which provides for an unsettling fear of never-ending revenge, and makes you feel as though you can never really escape from your worst nightmares. The storyline then mirrors the original. Camp counsellors setting up cabins in a sunny summer retreat deep in the woods, surrounded by lake. We are introduced to our arrays of characters again, pretty much the same; the horny couple, the fearless virgin, the jealous guy. This installment also saw a man in a wheelchair, which was quite original in the terms of a character. There is still a lot of suspense and tension. The camerwork still continues to 'stalk' it's victims behind trees and bushes in the way of showing us how the victim sneaks around. The carnage begins, and surely, the sexually active teens are hacked off one by one, with some really unforgettable gory scenes, which will stick with you. There is also gratuitous nudity shots, which always seem to make horror films more appealing for it's audience. The twist then starts to become clear near the end. Jason Voorhees is back for revenge. And he isn't happy. A fight for survival then ensues between the lead character, Ginny, and Jason Voorhees. The film does recycle a few of the originals techniques, for example, the surprise ending, which will make many of the audience jump. But overall this is a very fine sequel which is definitely worth watching. A good follow up to a horror classic.",Friday the 13th Part 2
238,thetheonly,Sack head Jason,7,4 October 2019,"This is the first incarnation of jason. This one is more memorable than the first but not the best the series has to offer. I also won't be giving a synopsis since at this point many other reviewers have provided it but i will be going over what this films succeeds at and fails at. First the kills as always are above average, I do miss that Savini didnt work on this one but they're still very good. This one also has more defined characters than the original and succesfully continues the plot of the first. Finally the atmosphere is really good and how they return back to the camp setting is very successful. The negatives of this film like others in the series is in the beginning flashing back to the previous films in this one its almost 10 minutes long which was annoying but its not the worst ever (silent night deadly night 2). My next problem is Jason, I think the sackhead look is alright, its just not iconic and luckily they changed over to the hockey mask in the next one. My other problem is a bit of bad acting but luckily its not consistent in the film and most actors are actually pretty good. All in all better than the first but not the best of the series",Friday the 13th Part 2
239,DMP-2,Great film and a great followup,8,16 November 2001,"Not the masterpiece that the first one was, but still pretty good. This film made me understand the series.

I had no idea how the story originated I just knew a slasher film. This sequel does a great job following up  to the first movie. I give it a 6.7 out of 10",Friday the 13th Part 2

Jason comes back to get revenge for his what happened to his Mom This movie is when we begin to repeat the same cycle with each new movie: new campers, new camp name, recap of what happened in the previous movies, Jason, repeat. This was when it was still fresh so it is a fun movie. The set pieces are good. Jason is still scary. The acting is surprisingly good overall. Its a great sequel. Jason is scary. I recommend it.",Friday the 13th Part 2
241,bramb600,An improvement but still mediocre.,6,15 June 2009,"Now this was a much better horror than the first one. The main reason that it's better had to be because the addition of the great Jason Voorhees who eventually became an icon and he deserves it because he's scary as hell.Jason is a much better killer and simply has a scarier look. Even without the hockey mask I have to agree with that. He goes through the whole movie wearing a sac on his head. The sac was really a nice touch to make him look so much more like a lunatic and he would be the kind of person you would be terrified of, especially since he runs in this movie as well.The movie was satisfying but still not great, but it will pave the way for some great ones.",Friday the 13th Part 2
242,sn319,"Compared to the First, this Sequel's Not Too Great",5,9 December 2014,"Taking place five years after the original film, this not-so-great sequel has a group of teens going to camp counseling camp at a camp nearby Crystal Lake. The movie opens with the hero of the first film having PTSD and we get to relive the events of the first movie...FOR FIVE MINUTES. Later on, the counselors all sit around the fire while the tale of Jason and the girl is told, making that five minutes a completely useless waste of time.This film, unlike the first, moves at a snails pace with a lot of focus on the characters. It takes a long time before anything happens (about halfway through the movie) all to get a couple of lame deaths and an even lamer ending. This time, rather than battling the mother of Jason, they battle Jason disguising himself as the Zodiac Killer.It's a poor movie but it's easy to make fun of. It's definitely nowhere near as good as the original, but it's still not quite as bad as some of the other sequels. Overall, I'd probably pass on this unless you're planning on riffing it.",Friday the 13th Part 2

245,very_doubtful,As good as the first one! (!SPOILERS!),8,20 March 2000,"Jason gives his debut in a surprisingly good sequel. There are certain differences between this one and the original though (see below). Jason continues where his mother stopped (having lost her head), showing more intelligence and being much scarier than Mrs. Voorhees.At the beginning we see Alice (the only survivor from part one) having nightmares. Soon after she is getting killed by Jason (yes, Sharon Stone wasn't the first one to use an ice pick). There could have been a happy end now with Jason having had his revenge without too many people being wasted. But he is still upset (or traumatised?) looking for fresh blood at a newly opened camp near the old Camp Crystal Lake and so the death-rate increases at high speed.The gore scenes aren't as elaborate and creative as in the first F13 but still can make the heart of any gorehound jump. It doesn't have as much suspense as the first one but it contains the better scares. The girls are cute and of course there is more nudity in this one. It also seemed to be less predictable and the acting has improved a lot (which still doesn't mean the acting was good!). Amy Steel as Ginny is more convincing than Alice (Adrienne King) was and even the final chase scene is better with Ginny behaving smarter than Alice. Jason looks a little weird though with the pillow case (?) over his head. Thank Goodness they gave him the hockey mask in Part 3!Overall a sequel that is worth watching and (almost) as good as its predecessor!My rating: 8/10",Friday the 13th Part 2

The double impalement was crap. All it showed was a shocked face and a bloody spear. I just wanted to say I hated that death scene. They could have done better than that. The machete splitting the face also could have done better. It just shows it happen from behind and then he rolls down the stairs. I was disappointed with that death too. Finally, the end was so random! I was waiting to see this film for a long time and I found a spoiler that Paul disappeared and was presumed dead and I thought that would be an interesting thing to see in a slasher film. What I got was extremely disappointing. It was just ""where's Paul?"" and that was it! Disappointing!Other than that, I enjoyed it. It had some funny lines. I guess I'll give it a 6 out of 10 and a grade of around C+.",Friday the 13th Part 2
247,kayrannells,Smart Sequel,8,13 October 2020,"Against all odds, the lone survivor of the last film is quickly taken out by Jason - the son of the last film's killer who was under the impression that he died some point in the 50's. Meanwhile, a camp across the lake from Crystal Lake is about to open for the summer and they've gathered their staff of sexually charged counselors to help get it ready for campers. Jason returns home after his homicidal jaunt into town and is none too pleased that he's having to share his lake with a bunch of strangers, so he gathers up every sharp implement he can find and goes off to teach these inconsiderate brats a lesson.A film with a plot this dumb shouldn't work, but Friday the 13th Part 2 does thanks to fine direction by Steve Miner who has an flair for building suspense and landing a jump scare and an incredibly appealing cast who give their characters more dimension than was probably on the page. Amy Steele deserves a special mention as the smart Ginny who makes for a great audience surrogate.",Friday the 13th Part 2
248,sunshinebeachcinema,The bloodshed continues as we return to Camp Crystal Lake for the second time,6,30 May 2014,"This is the first sequel to Friday the 13th (1980) and in many ways it's a retread of the original. We're back in Camp Crystal Lake, where a new gang of teenagers have had the less than sensible idea to try and become camp counsellors. Most of the films in the series follow a basic formula, and there are about ten more of these, each with their own idiosyncrasies that define them, for better or worse.Friday the 13th, Part 2 stands out for a number of reasons. For one thing, it's the first sequel, and the first to directly feature the killer who would go on to define the franchise: Jason Voorhees. Notably, he hasn't even acquired his signature hockey mask yet, and instead obscures his face with a sack. Unfortunately, it looks a little stupid and impractical, and it's nowhere near as iconic as the hockey mask or even the white mask of Michael Myers in the competing Halloween franchise. But otherwise clad in a plaid shirt and dungarees, this Jason comes across more as a shady backwoods killer than the relentless undead monster of later sequels.The story is set up quickly and simply. After a direct flashback to the ending of the previous movie, we get a tense, jump-filled introduction which ties up the one loose end from the first film, the lone survivor Alice. Back at Crystal Lake, new counsellors are attending pre-camp training, led by Paul (John Furey) and his girlfriend Ginny (Amy Steel), who are the main protagonists. The other counsellors are merely fodder for Jason.This fact is obscured at first, as Paul takes most of the counsellors out for a last night on the town before camp begins. As a result, we see little of Paul and Ginny until later in the movie. Unsurprisingly, those who choose to say behind at the camp are sitting ducks, and for the next act, there is no clear protagonist.The director, Steve Miner, retains the atmosphere of his predecessor, but with slightly tighter pacing. He would direct the third instalment in the franchise; as a result, the first trilogy has some of the strongest continuity in the series. Thematically, this film is linked with the original in ways that the other films aren't.I liked the way that the story of Jason and his mother was told around the campfire early in the film. This tale encourages the characters to head into the woods to find evidence of Jason or the original Camp Crystal Lake, and it does not end well once Jason realises they have trespassed on his hallowed ground. This Jason is still haunted by the ghost of the late Mrs. Voorhees and we also see where he lives: in a ramshackle cabin in the woods behind the lake, and this is where the final chase and fight end up.Ginny is revealed to be studying child psychology and discusses the effect Jason's upbringing and the death of his mother may have had on his behaviour. Cleverly, Ginny eventually uses her knowledge to manipulate Jason in the finale and buy time.Another recurring theme is that characters mention what they're going to do with the rest of their lives (using those words) which is deeply ironic, considering the fate that will likely befall them. One character declares she needs a couple of months to sort her life out, one idly muses about what he'll do for the rest of his life, another promises that she will never be 'late' again, and a disabled character declares he doesn't intend to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair.Save a hockey mask, there's here everything that a Friday the 13th film suggests, including some good action (at one point, Ginny attempts to fend Jason off with a chainsaw), inventive and gory death scenes and plenty of neglectful sexcapades which lead to the arrival of Jason. So it does the job.",Friday the 13th Part 2

I also like this and parts 3 and 4 because these are the movies where Jason actually acts like he's human rather than a zombie like in the later movies.  And what's cool is Jason actually has a different disguise rather than the ol' hockey mask.  What's stupid was that he actually fell for the trick believing that Ginny was his mother and yet his mother's death was the reason why he was killing all those people.  Of course, then again, he was retarded, so maybe that's the reason why, I guess I'll never know.  A real good start on the Jason movies.",Friday the 13th Part 2

Unfortunately, being that it is a slasher film it can't rise to be anything too superb, however it is one of the slicker slasher films.  Very good suspense, impressive special effects (Of course that's what you get when you hire goremaster Tom Savini), slick coordination, nice girls, stupid plot (what else do you expect out of a slasher movie!), and stupid ending.  All in all it works out fine!!!  If you liked Curtains you'll probably like this, and vice versa ; )  The chase scene at the end is a little silly, but oh well!!!  Atleast Jason wasn't discoing, which is a blessing considering it was that time period.  Horror fans that aren't going to be too sceptical will enjoy this, but if you're a Sherlock Holmes that is going to pause the movie to think the plot through I guarantee you will be so disgusted you'll be spitting left and right by the end so avoid it.

The MPAA cut a few great kills so that hurt the film in a way. Amy Steel is great as the heroine and plenty of great gratuitous nudity fills the screen. Good follow up and worth a look.,Friday the 13th Part 2
254,TomConnors,Heeeeerrreeeesssss.....Jason.,7,23 February 2005,"OK, so Jason, a son of a #$@#, as we learned from part 1, is out continuing the damage done by the killer in ""Friday the 13th"". Believed to be drowned as a boy, we see that obviously he survived and has been living in the woods all these years. Deformed and hungry for blood, teenagers at Camp Crystal Lake better beware!!! OK, the teenagers aren't exactly at camp crystal lake, the camp itself has been closed since it never got re-opened after the events of the first film, but a little ways down the lake, is a camp councilor training camp full of teenagers for the picking.An interesting and historical turn not just for the series itself, but film history in general. Part 3 would be even more significant.Great special effects, but not a lot of them after the hack job for the censors.",Friday the 13th Part 2
255,michellegriffin-04989,Sackhead Jason is The Best!,9,30 September 2020,"Before he got his infamous hockey mask in the next sequel, Jason had a different and much creepier disguise in this movie. I'm not sure if that's the reason I think this is one of the better sequels, but it plays a big part in it. The story is basically the same as all the other movies in this franchise, but we have creepy sackhead Jason and a great final girl, Ginny, who is rightly considered one of the best adversaries for Jason in the entire series. It also helps that the rest of the cast is equally as likable and you feel bad for them when they're killed. At this point, we were still rooting for the victims and not Jason.",Friday the 13th Part 2
256,matthurst-60645,How Slashers Should Be Done,8,28 October 2020,"After the events of the first film, another camp opens up across the lake and, while they're getting ready for more campers, Jason shows back up and he's not too pleased that people are trespassing in his woods.In the narrative sense, Friday the 13th Part 2 doesn't have a lot new to say that the previous film didn't cover. In fact, the plots are nearly identical in many ways, but it's the little details that help make it stand out. It gives us a great final girl with Ginny (Amy Steel) and most of the murders and suspense set pieces are not only better executed but better shot than the first film. It's a huge step up all around.",Friday the 13th Part 2
257,halloweennight1978,ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL! FRIGHTFULLY GREAT FUN!,9,22 August 2003,"""f13:part 2"" isnt as good as the original (of course)but it is very close to the formula of the first movie: thrilling, chilling, terrifying, and gory. i like how sympathetic i felt towards some of these characters. part 2 is also legendary for introducing the legendary jason voorhees. ONE OF THE BEST SEQUELS TO ANY MOVIE. A GREAT RIDE!",Friday the 13th Part 2
258,jmcgee321,Here Comes JASON!!!!!!!!,8,19 March 2005,"After the brilliant Friday THE 13TH, Hollywood of course got greedy and rushed in a sequel with the help of writer Ron Kurz and director Steve Miner. What they deliver is a good installment and top notch death scenes not surpassing the first, but still shocking.Five years after the events of the first film, the survivor of that horrible day is killed by JASON, the boy believed to be drowned for the last 25 years. So now he's finishing off what mama started. Making sure no one goes to Camp Crsytal Lake. But when a new summer camp is opening up right next to his domain, he decides to kill first and ask questions way later.No the hockey mask dosen't come in folks, and no this is not better than the first one. But this one has a playful mode than one, which at it's time was serious. The acting by Amy Steel and John Furey is more of something to root for, because we do care if THEY do die or not. And JASON performance seem lock on, although KANE HODDER is a saint when he plays JASON. And the death scenes are toned down a bit, but still leaves us with that strange feeling in our stomach. Especially the bit involving a wheelchair, what will just make you say ""Now that's just plain wrong.""",Friday the 13th Part 2
259,worthythorn24,Decent follow up to the first,5,28 October 2005,"Friday the 13th Part two begins much the same way as the first one. A girl is brutally murdered by a faceless killer and leaves it up to the viewers to decide if the perpetrator is none other than Jason Voorhees, back from his watery grave for revenge? Well, unless you have been hiding under a rock for the last 20 years you know the killer IS Jason and this is the movie where he takes his rightful place in the hearts of horror movie aficionados worldwide.Friday 2 was Paramount's big follow up to their sleeper hit of the same name the year before. After the success of Friday 1, Paramount realized they had a cash cow on their hands and quickly gave the green light to director Steve Miner to make a sequel. This film takes place 5 years after the tragic events of the first. Crystal Lake is open again (albeit a few miles away from the crime scene of ""Camp Blood"") for business. We meet several new, pretty young people who are ripe for the slaying and represent every cliché thinkable. But god you have to love these films! They're so bad that they're good. Watching a Jason movie is like watching a car wreck. You just can't seem to look away.Curiously, Jason appears in this movie wearing a burlap sack rather than the hockey mask we have come to love over the years. He doesn't get that until the third installment. I think the burlap sack sort of adds a hokeyness to this film; some much needed levity. There are some brutal kills in this outing, particularly the one involving the poor kid in the wheelchair (OUCH!). Aestically, the movie looks good and the new DVD does a wonderful job in restoring quality. I remember having this movie on VHS and it literally looked like it was filmed from a personal camcorder. I wish they had not killed off the character of ""Crazy Ralph"". I really enjoyed watching him warn the characters about going to Crystal Lake. All his death did was add another body to Jason's overall tab. One burning question I have is when the police officer goes into the woods to pursue Jason. He leaves his car parked right in the middle of the road. Wouldn't the police have organized some sort of search mission for him? The car was there for several hours at least! Maybe Jason got them, too. The acting in this movie is definitely a notch lower than in the first one. The only person who did a good job was the guy who played Jason. Perhaps it was because his face wasn't shown :). I'm giving this movie a 5/10. Average installment in the series, but it is brutal, nostalgic and important in the franchise because it marks the debut of Mr. Voorhees.",Friday the 13th Part 2
260,troutman,"Acting, What's That?",9,11 January 1999,Yes as is traditional with all Friday the 13th movies the acting sucks badly.However this is the last of the really creepy Friday the 13th films. Jason is more scary in this with that pillow case or whatever it is on his head than when he got that Hockey mask thingy.This is one of the last of the scary Friday the 13th movies and the series went down hill quickly after what should have been the Final Chapter (Part 4).The acting may be rubbish but sit back and watch an old time scary movie that's really enjoyable.,Friday the 13th Part 2
261,dreammaster4,Totally Awesome,10,13 July 2000,"Being a huge fan of horror movies.This is one of my favorite,now we got Jason without the mask slashing some teenagers in the now legendary ""Camp Crystal Lake"".What I really love about this flick are the scenes before the deaths.Again, like the first one,very atmospheric.Not as good as the first one but really close!",Friday the 13th Part 2
262,sumana-m21,Awesome sequel!,8,22 February 2009,"This was an awesome sequel. It was in fact way better than the original Friday the 13th. It had enough tense and suspense scenes to make you scream. Enough gores for those gore lovers out there, good direction and cinematography. It would have been better if this ended up being the first Friday the 13th because the first one did not manage to scare me at all. Most of the Friday the 13th movies have more or less the same plot, kill or be killed. Run, scream, chase, ponder, die. But it would be much more thrilling if they had people live much longer and in fact instead of killing the characters, making them run for their lives. I think thats where the thrill lies and most of the 1980's Friday movies are not very intense and characters are killed almost immediately which can be boring because when you're waiting to be spooked, some guy running his knife across the character's throat in a split second isn't scary but can be funny.These movies are thoroughly often enjoyed by the teen folk/young adult and why not? It deserves an 8/10!",Friday the 13th Part 2
263,Dellamorte_Dellamore07,Is this a sequel or a freaking lazy remake???,5,6 September 2004,"I watched this movie lots, I'm just a big jason fan. This sequel adds nothing, is a boring re hash of the first. Even the characters are REALLY weak and that's saying a lot for a horror flick. There's not even the token slut, stoner, loser, nice girl,etc. The thinly are just there too get butchered. Jason has a semi cool look, if you enjoy seeing a elephant man wannabe running around with a pitch fork. The kills are blah, going from the basic machete kills, a kitchen knife stabbing, two lovebirds getting speared, hammer in the head, but my favorite was the ice pick in the temple, especially since it was done on the ""whatever"" heroine from the first.Only see this if your a big firday fan and too see Jason's first appearance. The first ten minutes are fun and the last 20 mins with the super cool Ginny kicking Jason's ass.* out of ****",Friday the 13th Part 2

I love jason voorhees! I have not seen Friday part 3. But I know it will be great! I'm about to order this one sometime. Every time I see jason pop out, I get a big jump. I can not wait for part three. But this movie made my week! The first Friday the 13th was kinda boring. It was actually a bit funny. ""Kill her mommy. Kill her. Get her. Get her, mommy. I will get her, Jason."" (YAWN). This one was really good and all but why, in every Jason movie there has got to be loads and loads of nudity. Just like this one. There was even full frontal nudity. It just makes me think, "" Uh oh. I know whats about to happen"". That is the only annoying thing of the whole Friday series. That is about all that I have to say. JASON ROCKS!",Friday the 13th Part 2
265,Devil_Boy_80,A Great Sequel,8,4 July 2005,"Friday the 13th Part 2 is a great sequel and we finally meet the king of horror Jason Voorhees, The Plot is Two months after the events of the original, Alice, the sole survivor of the Camp Crystal Lake massacre, is trying to pick up the pieces of her life. But when she opens the refrigerator door to find Mrs. Voorhees' severed head, an unseen assailant stabs her through the temple with an icepick.Five years later, Paul Holt opens a Counselor Training Center at Packanack Lodge, adjacent to the now-defunct Camp Crystal Lake. Crazy Ralph again tries to warn of the coming danger, but is again ignored. Around the campfire, the counselors are told to ignore the local lore that Jason Voorhees, whose mother was responsible for the earlier murder spree, is alive. Crazy Ralph watches Paul and Ginny in her cabin, and is strangled with barbed wire by the killer.The next day, two of the counselors, Sandra and Jeff, slip away to the off-limits Camp Crystal Lake and are caught and escorted back to the Center by a police officer. On the way out, a figure darts in front of the officer's car and into Camp Crystal Lake. In pursuit, the officer discovers a ramshackle cabin and is killed with a hammer to the back of the head.That evening, most of the counselors go to a local bar, leaving six behind - Sandra and Jeff, Scott and Terry and Vickie and Mark. Scott spies on the skinny-dipping Terry, but when he tries to get away with her clothes he's caught in a rope trap. Terry leaves to get a knife, only to discover Scott's throat has been slit before her return. Terry runs back to camp, only to be killed herself.Back at the bar, Paul, Ginny and Ted discuss the legend of Jason Voorhees and what he would be like if still alive. Ginny guesses he would have seen his mother decapitated by Alice, and that seeing the only person who had ever loved him killed would leave an indelible mark.When Vickie leaves the wheelchair-bound Mark is killed with a machete. Sandra and Jeff are impaled together with a spear while having sex, and the killer -- now revealed as the bag-wearing Jason Voorhees -- murders Vickie as well.Paul and Ginny return to the camp, and after finding the lodge empty, Paul is attacked by Jason. Ginny flees through the woods, finally coming to Jason's shack, now filled with the bodies of the dead counselors. Seeing Mrs. Voorhees' severed head and sweater on Jason's makeshift altar, Ginny puts on the sweater and readies herself for the final confrontation. . .A truly Great sequel I recommend this to All Horror fans.",Friday the 13th Part 2

The ending made me so mad that I can't give this movie any justice. Mabe its cuz I have not seen the third one.

268,claptonisgod53,Very Underrated; The Best In The Series,7,26 August 2008,"In my opinion, Friday the 13th Part 2 is without a doubt the best film in the entire Friday the 13th series. It is not only a big improvement over just about any other films in the series, but it is a big improvement over a lot of other slashers from the time period. While my favorite 80s slasher is the Burning, Friday the 13th Part 2 remains to be my all time favorite in the series, and remains in my Top 5 80s Slashers.Friday the 13th Part 2 is also something that so many other Friday the 13th films are lacking; the fact that it is actually frightening. I like the way this film builds up suspense until the very ending, which I love very much. The death scenes aren't lacking in this movie either. Some very notable deaths include: a double impalement with a giant spear, a machete in a face of a guy in a wheel chair, several throat slitting, and a very fun scene involving a hammer and the back of a man's head. While this movie was destroyed by the MPAA, this movie is still a good time.One other thing that makes this film stand out from the others in the series is the simple fact that the characters are interesting. While they may still seem un-developed and pointless to the storyline, they are still given enough development so the audience is interested. Amy Steel is my all time favorite Friday the 13th heroine. She's very cute, and easily the smartest character in the entire franchise.Check out Friday the 13th Part 2. When it comes to slashers, you can go much worse. Highly Recommended.",Friday the 13th Part 2
269,Krush_Burner,A decent sequel to a classic slasher,9,31 March 2014,"This installment is not my favorite, but it does not mean it has nothing to offer to a horror fans. The most important thing about this part is, of course, the emergence of Jason Voorhees (albeit not in his iconic image yet). The plot is quite simple, characters are plain, and killings are well-made. Unfortunately, story is focusing more on character relations (which is not very interesting matter here anyway), than on Jason's origins. But it is interesting enough to see this film as a part of a growing franchise: you'll see some trademark elements, which will be repeated in almost every other sequels. I don't know how many fans of a modern (post-""Scream"") horror films can appreciate this one, but I think anyone who wants to explore the roots of a Hockey Mask Killer should not be disappointed.",Friday the 13th Part 2
270,WandrinStar,Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981),5,20 February 2012,"57/100. Like mother, like son. Enjoyed it considerably more than I expected too. Horror icon Jason Voorhees takes center stage as the series' main antagonist for the first time wearing, not a hockey mask, but a hooded sack that pays homage to 1976's The Town that Dreaded Sundown. While Jason works as a menacing killer, the idea of a large, brooding knife wielding man was already done in Halloween. Miner does a passable job, but gets rid of many key directorial elements Cunningham used to make the original as good as it was. The cast of camp counselors once again do a fantastic job, and final girl Amy Steel equals and maybe even surpasses Adrienne King. Would have given serious consideration of giving this a higher grade but the film was bogged down with plot holes including never answering how Jason survived drowning or if he ever reunited with his mother and if so why didn't he attack the last bunch of teenagers himself. Beginning sequence is atrociously long and commits my least favorite horror movie cliché of killing off the previous survivor(s) in the opening. Film follows the original almost to a tee including having one of the most predictable unpredictable endings ever. Return of Crazy Ralph was a pleasant bonus.",Friday the 13th Part 2
271,cmoore0013,Surprisingly good sequel,8,3 January 2006,"After the box office success of the original, Paramount wasn't stupid enough to stop, so they made the first sequel in 1981. Although low on plot, Friday the 13th Part 2 has a little bit more than it's given mention of. Most of the characters are actually pretty likable, which in the slasher craze of the 80's was pretty rare.The direction by Steve Miner is very good. He knows how to film a stalk scene with perfect ease. This is on of the few sequels that managed to create some sort of tension. The final chase between Ginny and Jason is one for the books. You really do not know if she will make it out alive or not.The film does suffer some blows in the violence department. All the fans know that this was probably the sequel the MPAA chopped up the most and it shows. The scene abruptly cuts before anything too visceral is shown. 1981 did seem to be the year that the MPAA was it's worst.All the cuts aside, Fridya the 13th Part 2 still raises some goosebumps, has a great atmosphere, pretty good acting, likable characters, inventive murders, and creates some good tension.",Friday the 13th Part 2

273,cfcurrie,"The finest of the Friday the 13th movies,",8,12 October 2015,"The second Friday the 13th is formulaic and simplistic in execution, but it was also one of the first to establish that formula. The entire cast is fresh, and the pace is near perfect. Despite MPAA requiring nearly a minute of footage to be cut, and the re-cut of the final scene which can lead to some fan confusion (Paul is dead, dying to save Ginny. No, she did not dream this sequence) the film still manages to overcome its flaws to solidify the blueprint of an '80's slasher flick. This film is often thought of as the first first appearance of Jason, or the movie without the Hockey mask, but more than anything it illustrates how those conventions define the Villain in pop culture and yet proved not necessary to embody the spirit of what a ""Friday the 13th"" film is.Not one to miss.",Friday the 13th Part 2

The music score was pitch perfect one of the best soundtracks I've ever listened too.Okay now here's the Bad or for this movie disappointing.The beginning of the movie was great but what I didn't like was how Alice (Spoiler Alert Spoiler Alert) got immediately killed off. It made her character seem weak I mean she defended herself from the killer in part one.Another thing was the effects which were good but we didn't get to see the finished product which was the death scenes they practically got cut! such a shame 7/10In the end this movie is definitely worth buying on DVD and it is one of my favorites.

That scene was quite disturbing. I had recorded the movie from TV, but I erased it.As I grew older I came in contact with all of the ""Friday""-movies and started to like Jason. Part 6 became a favorite when I was 16.Now when I'm 21 I have bought all the ""Friday""-movies. And I must say I really like them. I have seen them many many times and now I know that Part 2 is the very best in the whole series. I also like Part 3, but it is Part 2 that deliver the best scares and the best scenes.I don't know exactly what it is with Part 2 that is so great. I just love it. Go rent it or go buy it at once.

First of all, it is Jason's debut, and you can see his true persona in this movie. Described as a confused boy living in a man's body living as a recluse deep in the woods. The plot of this sequel is excellent, having Jason turn to murder after witnessing his mother's death in the first one. Also, he is a more believable killer than his mother and is also not seen as undestructible as he is in further sequels. The first one may have slightly better scares and better acting, but Jason makes the series and his absence in the first film is what ultimately makes the second film superior to the first.",Friday the 13th Part 2

Once again, idiotic teens camp out at Camp Crystal Lake where many before them had been brutally murdered. Does that stop them? Of course not!

Jason dosen't have his hockey mask yet, but its still, I think, the best Jason. Part 2 is everything you wanted in a slasher film, gore, scares, love, and a great finale and opening. The film opens great and a twist ending that's preditacble, but scary, because your just waiting for it to happen, and its happens when your not prepared for it. It has likable charters, and a character you will feel bad for, when you see him, you'll think ""Nooooo don't kill him!"" There are 2 surviors, and I won't say if he is one of them. Friday The 13th Part 2, I think so far is the best. I haven't seen all the FT13 movies, but I can't see how any of them could be better 7.3/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
281,samuel_gale,Better than the original Friday,7,24 January 2020,"I enjoyed this film a lot lot more than the original, this one had a better story-ish and better cinematography. The pacing felt a lot better, it never dragged on for too long but I wish they made it a bit longer, and added in some more suspense and enigma.
The kills were a bit boring in some places, I liked the fence wire kill but i thought the rest of them were meh and they could've shown the kills at least from a different angle or made them a little longer. It annoyed me when Jason killed someone then the music plays then cut after 2 seconds, then it moves onto a different scene.
The dialogue is so poorly written I thought Jason was just gonna kill the characters then and there, the jokes they made weren't funny, I get that it's not the main focus but jeez. I kind of liked Ginny's dialogue at the end, It was a bit meh but at least they tried doing something to get Jason to stop.
The characters are boring and there isn't really anything too them, I didn't feel that sorry when they got killed off.
I dislike the ending, Jason didn't need to come back onscreen for another jump scare, remaining the original. They had the chance to have a low angle on his hand and make him crawl forwards for a few seconds. That makes you want to see the next one.
Overall Thoughts:
The film was good and I forgive it's issues, It is my favourite Friday The 13th film so far and it's the one i have enjoyed the most.

282,leslie_rulz08,Great slasher sequel ruined by a couple plot holes,4,22 May 2009,"From Steve Miner, the director of Friday the 13th Part III (D) (1982), House (1985), Warlock (1989), Halloween H2O (1998), Lake Placid (1999) & Day of the Dead (2008).Five years ago, Miss Voorhees returned to Camp Crystal Lake to avenge her poor son Jasons death again. That time she was caught & decapitated by one of the counselors.2 months after the massacre, the survivor was murdered by a maniac in her own home.Now, a number of teenagers & young adults including Amy Steel (April Fool's Day (1986) have started to attend a nearby summer camp. Soon, the head counselor warns everyone about Jason, his land & his horrific backstory including his overprotective mother Pamela. Despite the above, everything goes well.Meanwhile, a madman commits a couple murders than heads to the camp where the half of the counselors have gone down town to party. The other half are messing around with each other in the cabins/campgrounds when the maniac arrives & starts to kill them in the usual fashion.Friday the 13th Part 2 is part 1 all over again. But this time, it has been improved. While there is no story or suspense or script like the original, the acting is still OK. Unoriginal & clichéd like the Friday the 13th (1979), but.Anyway, the movie is played out in the usual fashion but the reason i like it is that it is fast paced & entertaining UNLIKE the first.The score is the same as the number 1 & the atmosphere is the same as number 1 & the direction has improved. Still, the film is really effective & strong & is set in a very grisly mode. Also the film has lots of jokes & most of them unlike the other Friday the 13th films work. & for some reason, the flick just attracts me.The characters help too. Jason make his first main role & his outfit/mask is really freaky & realistically raw. This gives the picture a hillbilly theme which adds onto the tension. Another thing, the final girl Ginny (Amy Steel) is one badass chick which is different to the other final girls in the series (especially Alice from the original).This girl knocked Jason over, waited IN FRONT of a tree only to knee him in between the legs. Amy Steel also nearly cuts his arm off with his own machete. The girl harms him other times too but the above are the most notable ones. So...i guess the girl has balls.Yet despite all that, like most Friday the 13th films, this one has some big flaws/plot holes about Jasons background. I could ignore them but they make the plot...I mean if Jason didn't drown then why didn't he contact his mother?.........it just doesn't make sense.At least we get gore. Good gore: Most of the good death scenes are offscreen but the ones that aren't are OK & these scenes are effective so what can i say? Anyway we get lots of violence so gore fans won't be too disappointed. Good gore-strong violence.All in all, Friday the 13th 2 is a bad movie complete with a nice ending but IS underrated & IS better than the original...it gets better every viewing, though.I give it 2 out of 5 stars.",Friday the 13th Part 2
283,Charlotte_Kaye,Average slasher movie,5,29 March 2007,"Not much to really say about the first sequel to the huge hit Friday the 13th, except it gets the job done and that's about it. Sole survivor Alice (Adrienne King) is trying to put her life back together after nearly being killed by the psychotic Mrs. Voorhees in the first film. After some flashbacks to the original to catch viewers up (they are spliced in here as nightmares), Alice is brutally killed with an ice pick. Jumping ahead a few months, a whole new batch of counselors arrive at Camp Crystal Lake in a second attempt to reopen the camp. By now the place has earned its nickname ""Camp Blood"" but not even bicycle riding prophet of doom Crazy Ralph (Walter Gorney) can scare these folks away before it's too late. A few of the people are briefly introduced, and then it's business as usual as a hooded, hulking figure goes around chopping everybody up. The gore effects from Carl Fullerton are pretty good but not quite up to the original. The death scenes aren't too original this time out and include your usual throat slashings and stabbings. What most people assume is the most ""original"" death is a double impalement with a spear. However, the same exact death was used in Mario Bava's superior slasher movie ""Bay of Blood"" from way back in 1971. The entire ""Friday"" series drew inspiration from Bava's movie and anyone who is a fan of this series should also see that film. Anyway, about midway through the movie becomes a little too boring and repetitive for its own good. However, things pick up nicely again during the last 20 minutes or so and there's are a few great scares thrown in at the end. Overall, pretty good for this series, but just average and typical for the horror genre as a whole.",Friday the 13th Part 2

285,Stoomkracht,The final girls inspiration but terribly dated,3,22 May 2021,"And just not a good movie at that.

286,hagg,This is the cult classic that introduced Jason Voorhees to millions of American film audiences.,10,8 July 2002,"One of the creepiest entries in the Friday series! In many ways, Friday The 13th Part II is better than the original. It features a more pluckier heroine in Amy Steel, a nasty and scary atmosphere courtesy of Steve Miner, who would also direct Part III and of course this is the cult classic that introduced Jason Voorhees to millions of American film audiences. This takes place five years after the original at a training center down the road from Camp Crystal Lake. This was the start of a trait that would bog down the later sequels, that is the same old routine of teenagers splitting up when it should be obvious that some thing or someone is outside lurking about. However, the many positives, including a scary killer and Amy Steel tend to outweigh the negatives. C'mon Jason, on to Part III and beyond!",Friday the 13th Part 2
287,cactuscab,Part deux,7,31 January 2007,"The young people return to Camp Crystal Lake (well, across the lake at the very least) no worse for the wear, dimly envisioning another seven sequels and a monster mash up with Freddy down the road. Even poor old coot Ralph is on the sore end of his warning that doom awaits those who enter. Ask not for whom the bell tolls, Ralph. As for the kids they frolic, smoke weed, copulate and die, generally in that order. Steve Miner makes Part 2 the most self-consciously stylish of the sequels using Jason's P.O.V. to directly implicate the audience in the violence, but also turning us into voyeurs, leering as the scantly clad Terri (is there a cinematic character with tighter shorts and tinier tops? Not that I'm complaining) goes skinny-dipping. Later she throws a towel on the leering camera (and by transference, us the audience) presumably so we can clean up after ourselves.Pre-hockey mask Jason makes his adult debut here and is particularly nasty as the sex=death focus of the series is established in full. One couple is skewered immediately post orgasm. A handicapped fella gets a machete to the face pre-sexafied, presumably sent blue balled to the afterlife. And dig how that wheelchair maintains its balance all the way down those stairs.The lead this time a tomboyish female who fends off Jason using her child psych degree to fool him into acquiescence (well, sort of. It ultimately leads to another 'Carrie' ending rip-off). Jason, ever the good boy, is fooled by the girl donning his mother's sweater. He then sees his mother telling him to put down his weapon. This is used again in Freddy vs Jason, where Freddy impersonating mother again, resurrects Jason by admonishing him into raising from the dead. Jason, buddy, cut the umbilical cord.",Friday the 13th Part 2
288,fridayfan1,Great Sequel To A Great Series!!!!,8,22 April 2001,"This was not one of my favorite Fridays, but its still one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. It has a good plot and it's scarier than most of the other Friday movies. If you are a fan of the Friday series you have to love it because Jason makes his debut in this one. It has alot of great murder scenes, and the chase sequence at the end is great!!",Friday the 13th Part 2
289,andrewbarry6336,"Yes, we Meet Jason and boy is it a great time",9,22 November 2013,"As I am reviewing each film in the series I have noticed a trend. Almost everyone loves this one or Part Four: The Final Chapter. I openly admit that of all the Jason movies that this one scared me the most when I was younger because the knapsack over his head was extremely effective in making him scary. While I love the hockey mask he gets in Part 3, he is at his scariest in this film. The movie starts with our group of counselors trying to fix up Camp Blood again and there is a nice night time fire story about what happened in the first and how the legend says that Jason walks the camp looking to kill any counselor he finds. It is a nice set up and the fact Jason came to be because of a joke by the first films ending is amazing when you think about it. The story is nice and simple meaning the kills are what matters.I love the kills in this movie and the wheelchair kill is one of the best in the series. I also admit that Gina is one of my favorite heroine's in all the series and she is great in this one. Some of these kills are brutal by even today's standards which speaks volumes to how crazy it must have been to seen this in theaters and having a good time. While I love this one I have to admit my favorite in the series is Part 3,4,6, and I love the remake. I know that is against the grain but check out my reviews of those for my reasoning. This one is still great though and is great time all the way through. There is nothing more to say, watch this after watching the first and you will see why Jason fever is an amazing thing to catch. Great kills, great thrills, what more could you want out of a movie? I give it 4.5 outta 5 just like the original.",Friday the 13th Part 2
290,perttu_hartikainen,The same suspense as in the previous film,6,19 September 2008,"On 1978, we were on the edge of our seats as John Carpenter created one of the most markable horror masterpieces ever made. Two years later, we were entertained with another serial killer -flick including a now cult classic character. A year later, we got the sequel that offered us the same amount of suspense as the previous one, although not as much entertainment.Now, the last survivor of the massacre at Camp Crystal Lake, gets killed by the revenge-seeking Jason Voorhees, who is out of his mind after seeing his own mother killed before his eyes. After getting his revenge, he returns to Crystal Lake right when new counselors are staying at another camp nearby. It's Jason's turn to get even...There is slightly more creativeness in the killings, for example the cripple in the wheelchair getting a machete in the face and rolling down the stairs, but it isn't enough to entertain the audience more than the previous film did.Before getting his trademark hockey mask, Jason uses a potato sack to cover his deformed head. Although the potato sack inspired many later horror films and games (for example, Resident Evil 4's chainsaw-waving character) it isn't enough to give Jason the appearance he gets in the next sequel, part 3-D.All in all, Friday the 13th -series' two first movies are on the same level, although the first film one step higher in entertainment and second in creativeness. Part two was an okay film, but it still doesn't reach the level of part one when talking about entertainment. 6 out of 10 stars.",Friday the 13th Part 2
291,jackbruns29,A fine sequel to a Halloween knockoff.,7,30 December 2020,"Don't get me wrong. Even the creators of the first movie admitted Friday the 13th was a knockoff of Halloween.That said. Probably the biggest detractors to this movie are those who correctly point out that Jason Voorhees was supposed to be long dead even in the original movie. But I'm fine with it. It's a movie that knows what it is, and delivers. Personally, my own fan-fiction envisioned maybe Jason somehow making it to the shore, and nobody, not even his mother noticing that. Unfortunately, he becomes brain damaged due to lack of oxygen, and so is even more unreasonable and ashamed of his condition. So he watches his mother from a distance, until with horror watches as his mother's head is cut off. After Alice leaves, he takes his mother's head and heads back to his shack - already planning his vengeance. At least that's how I see it.Anyway, the plot itself is almost identical to the first, except with different camp counselors, and Jason Voorhees doing the kills instead of his mother. It's still great for what it is. It knows what it is. It's a very well made slasher B movie with some good special effects and good cinematography and a good ending. It's not the best one. That would be part four. It's not the funnest. That would be part six. But it's still pretty darn good.And did I mention it has by far the most gorgeous lady of the entire series in Kirsten Baker?",Friday the 13th Part 2

294,kailonchaboyer,A decent sequel,4,4 August 2021,Friday the 13th part 2 the movie to put Jason as the slasher king. Now if you have not watched the first friday the 13th you may not know but Jason is not the killer his mother is because Jason drowned. How did he live in the woods for 20+ years who knows but anyway lets get in to what I do like. What I do like is how good the continuity is with the First film. Camp crystal lake has become a legend and the fact that Alice hardy is back (andreinne king) now sadly that's the only things I really do like this movie has a lot more flaws with me then it has things I like. One thing I did not like was Jason's design...really your going to have your main killers mask just be a potato sack now I love sackhead Jason but com on man that's the best you could think of? Another thing is the rushed production of the film it just fells rushed the first ten minutes is just Alice rolling around in her bed dreaming of what happened in the fist movie... for twelve minutes and the movie is only 86 minutes long!so the entire meat of the story is only 70 minutes! Another thing I did not like about this movie is how little Jason is in this movie in the entire 86 minute runtime I estimate that Jason is in the movie for about 10 minutes.now you might be saying what about in the first friday the 13th movie the killer was only in that film for 10 minutes well at least it was creative the killers are done in the same manner as the fist movie! Anyway that was the review thanks for reading and overall I give this film a 4/10 2/5.,Friday the 13th Part 2

296,Heff2001,"An ""A"" for effort...",6,19 July 2001,"Okay, now that I'm older I can only give F13-2 five stars out of ten. Technically it's fine. Steve Miner pulled off some solid directing for the early 80s and his use of steadicam mimics that of ""The Shining"". You can say the acting was lame but it really wasn't...the script was. It became apparent as the ""Friday"" series continued that Paramount was concerned with one thing: cash. The thing that bothered me then was, even at age 14, I thought the follow up scripts SUCKED. Back to the actors...they didn't suck. I LOVE AMY STEEL and try to catch anything that I see her name on. She's a solid pro and has a great look. I've seen JOHN FUREY in other things and he was good. As for BETSY PALMER... you can NEVER say she is a bad actress. Even if she's in the most abysmal movie (THE FEAR 2!!) she lights up the whole production and pumps up the value. Why? She's a traditional actress that knows how to act and give it her all because she's there and agreed to do the job. Maltin even revised his review for part 1 to give her credit. I encourage all F13 fans (old and new) to check out her older flicks (look her up on imdb). But the thing that scared me about F13-2 back then, and still gives me the creeps, was Jason's sheet mask! I thought it was scarier than the hockey mask (now tired). It reminded me of THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN. I liked the fact that Ginny (Amy Steel) was a butt kicker and a truly tough chick for the early 80s. She rocked. And the score by HARRY MANFREDINI was awesome...totally tense. Someone give this guy a major flick and a huge orchestra! Will ya! Although most associated with the Friday's went on to successful careers (successful being subjective) I cannot understand why some of them weren't MORE successful (besides Kevin Bacon). I mean HELLO! Did anyone take any of these young actors seriously? LAURIE BARTRAM and HARRY CROSBY (part 1) had potential written all over her faces! It wasn't their fault they were given lame lines. Anyway, enough banter...those are my thoughts for the flick. Hope I'm not the only nostalgia fan. It's just the bitterness over Paramount blowing what could have been an excellent series. At least the TV Series was VERY cool. And we'll see what Cunningham and his son have pulled off for the new one. SEAN.... I want to write the next one!!!",Friday the 13th Part 2
297,LosAngelesLegend,A Classic Horror Sequel,9,22 September 2006,"I am a huge fan of the horror genre and have always preferred Jason over the comical Freddy Nightmare movies or Micahel Myers' stale franchise. People seem to always knock sequels of any genre but this sequel is one the best in any genre not just horror. It picks up after part 1 and it doesn't suffer from continuity problems as far as the storyline is concerned. In my opinion Friday the 13th is all about parts 1-4. But part 2 is just awesome all around. It has the same creepy atmosphere that part 1 and is topped by one of the greatest endings in horror cinema. The endings to part 1 and 2 in this series are some of the best. They just seem to go so well hand in hand. Friday 2 has always been my favorite in the entire series. As you all know it marks Jason's debut, and what's kind of sad is that Jason is identified with the hockey mask and his best movie is with the sack over his head. This one is a much more credible movie. It doesn't have a supernatural Jason who looks like a monster. He's a lot more human here and not so robotic. I love watching this movie on a breezy or stormy night. It's just a perfect slasher film. People should know that the horror genre especially the slasher kind are never going to win Oscar nominations, awards or have it's cast members win em either. Horror movies are a special treat of their own and Friday the 13th Part 2 is Jason's murderous rookie of the year foray into horror films. This movie is horror gold. From Jason's mother's head in the fridge, to the crash through the window classic ending. If it doesn't get a 10 from me, it's only because nothing is ever perfect.",Friday the 13th Part 2
298,jgibbon08,A disgrace to sequels everywhere,1,24 April 2008,"This film should be paired along with Speed 2: Cruise Control for being one of the worst sequels ever made. At times while watching this monstrosity, I could hardly believe what I was seeing. Everything, the acting, directing, editing, ""scares"", just all awful. In between the awful dialogue and random sex scenes, you will be subjected to gory and unimaginative killings. Good thing you won't feel anything while watching this other than sick to your stomach, because there is zero character development. Each character is given a name, a few lines, probably has sex, then dies. I don't know who to blame more for this flaming bag of crap. Probably not the actors, since they're not really given much to work with. While the first Friday the 13th wasn't exactly a work of art, trust me, this one makes it looks like Citizen Kane. Avoid this at all costs.",Friday the 13th Part 2
299,jeff934,Jason is here,10,26 July 2004,It's been a few months since Mrs Voorhees was killed and Alice is trying to get past everything. The only mistake she makes is that she tries to heal at Crystal lake. She ends up opening up her fridge and sees Mrs Voorhees head in it than after that shes killed who did it? Could it have been the son she talked about at the end of the first movie? Could it have been Jason Voorhees? After awhile alot of the Teens at the camp next to Camp Crystal Lake start to get killed in Gruesome fashion. everything from a Axe to a Mechette. This movie is a perfect Sequal it even has Crazy Ralph which is his last appearence in the movie series. I won't give it all away but what I'll say is if you want to see a good sequal than this is perfect just remember don't ever go in the woods alone lol j/k. my ranking for this movie. 10/10,Friday the 13th Part 2
300,tyhemp-2,"It's grainy, but it's a classic",9,19 December 1999,"Whatever anybody says about this movie, they have to realize that this is Jason's official, on-screen appearance (except with the drowning cameo in part I).  ANY true fan of Jason films will always consider this film a classic.  We get to see Jason at work here with the ""body shack"" and the fairly large body count.  He really does kill everyone and he certainly shows up Mrs. Voorhees.This movie is not very scary, it's just eerie.  It makes you wonder about Jason's motives for the first time.  The film is so grainy that you would think that Jason actually had the camera when he kills his victims.  It looks that real.  Movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre I are notorious for the realism their movies portray, and I think this Jason sequel-debut should go right up there with it.  I would love to see the main character of this sequel, Ginny (Amy Steel), come back to fight the ""real Jason"" twenty years later!  I hope casting for the new Jason X brings back at least one character from the past, whether it be Corey Feldman or Dana Kimmell. That's what makes these movies so dull.  How are we supposed to care about what happens to the characters when their a bunch of nobodies?I guess that's the FRIDAY trademark, though...",Friday the 13th Part 2
301,MrP823,Scary and Exciting,7,23 December 2002,"Honestly folks, this film is really not that bad providing that you can sit through a typical slasher formula flick. There are some surprisingly tense and claustrophobic scenes in this one, which as far as I am concerned easily make this the best of the series. It's also a lot of fun as it continues the story of the first movie with the debut of the infamous Jason Voorhees. Although I have always felt that Friday the 13th movies are really just Halloween clones, movies like this can be enjoyed as long as you don't take them too seriously and allow yourself to become too submerged in the often ridiculous elements that make up slasher films. And by the way, as weird as this may sound, I truly think that Jason's clothing and hood in this movie are much more twisted and scary looking than the garb he wore in all the other sequels. If I saw a hooded, demented hillbilly running at me with a pitchfork, I'm not afraid to admit that I might scream like a wee little school girl. Check this one out.",Friday the 13th Part 2

It was a good sequel for a movie and it was interesting to watch,but that was not horror,it was mystery and a little bit thriller. I don't say it was bad,movie was good for a slasher movie standards. Ironically it was 87 minutes,but you watch as a 15 minute movie. You couldnt understand the time was gone. Jason returned alive in this movie,he killed Alica and Ralph,old characters from first movie,then continue to kill. I think so many people is happy for watching this.",Friday the 13th Part 2
303,gaelcerda-35225,Great sequel. Arguably one of my favorites in the franchise...,10,2 February 2021,"This movie is awesome. One of the best sequels ever. Despite the gore and body count being toned down compared to the original, this movie is still great with great direction and great writing and the kills are still creative with its use of weapon tools. With just the right amount of blood, frightening images, this movie sets out to be one of the greatest horror movies ever made not just in terms of sequels. Bloodfest of kills with some nudity, sex, drugs, and suspense to go with it. Perfect movie. 10 STARS.

Adrienne King should've got a survival championship belt! Several scenes later, an assailant came behind Alice and stabbbed her in the temple, and that means, she lost the belt!!! Then, when Crazy Ralph (Walt Gorney from Part 1), came around and warned the two teens about what's gonna happen, and then they got it!Sandra (Marta Kober) looked like Foreinger's Lou Gramm, and I even liked the other girls. Then, Jason made his killing debut by sporting a hood over head, overalls, and blue checkered shirt. At the end, Amy Steel became the new Survival Champion!!! It was a shame that she didn't return for part 3, and she had to forfeit the title!I say that this a good sequel!!",Friday the 13th Part 2
305,ArmandTanzarian,entertaining but incredibly plot-hole ridden sequel.,5,10 May 2007,"If you liked the original F13 you'll like this if for no other reason than the repetition from the original.We open with a too long pre credits sequence where we get a recap of the original via some dreamt flashbacks from the survivor of F13. However, we get to see Jason (for it is he we later learn)first give her a silent phonecall and stick a knife in her brain. Now as watching this today after seeing another 8 sequels we know all about Jason, like may you may have wondered just how Jason was able to track Alice down, phone her and travel possibly many hundreds of miles with the mind of a simpleton and a sack over his head. But if you're looking for logic, this is the least of your worries here. We then fast forward 5 years and a batch of anonymous teens turn up on the lake to attend a sparsely attended camp counsellors training camp. However, they aren't in Camp Crystal Lake, but in another camp on the same Lake. CCL is off limits, but after hearing a spooky campfire story of how Jason didn't drown and watched Mrs Vorhees take her revenge and then be killed, Aice disappeared a month later and since then the legend of Jason has grown of him living like an animal in the woods ,a couple of teens decide ti check it out. Surprisingly they aren't killed but taken back to camp by the local sheriff who is inexplicably at a long abandoned summer camp. The sheriff then sees someone (Jason) run across the road and chases him to a rather large and unhidden cabin where he is dispatched by the clawed end of a hammer. Also the crazy drunk guy Ralph is killed by Jason at the new camp sometime around here. Anyway, after the usual evening of beer ,illicit sex and weed the teens decide to go into town, and it is the teens who haven't featured much so far/extras who go, leaving just the teens who have had some (minimal) character development, although the 'joker' does go and avoids the bloodbath. Needless to say the half dozen or so are one by one picked off by jason, including a wheelchair user who is stabbed and plummets the many steps on a steep slope, begging the question how he managed to navigate the rough woodland trails and steps up to every cabin thus far. Anyway, in a reference to Kevin Bacons death in F13 a copulating couple are speared together thru the bed. Id lost track of who was left by then but these must have been the last 2 cos the camp leader and his teen girl leave the bar and come back. It follow the now familiar formula - dscovery of bodies, chase, with more popping up en route. The gut is attacked and we think killed and the heroine finds Jasons cabin and there the decaying head of his mother in a shrine. Here, I wondered how the police didn't wonder where her head had gone but there you go. Oh yeah before this there's a fight in the cabin and at one point Jason is on the ground and there for the taking with the chainsaw she has but she inexplicably puts it down and hits him with a chair and runs out the cabin. Now this was really the worst example of slasher stupidity I've ever seen. Just chop hsi head off and its all over.So anyway, they fight in jasons cabin and she absurdly puts Mrs V's jumper on and tries to fool him its her.As jason is about to kill her Paul, the fella from before turns up,(being the 3rd person in 1 day to wander across jason's secret cabin where hes been 'hiding' for many years) rescues her and stabs him. they unmask him and assuming hes dead go back to their cabin where a freakishly deformed jason jumps thru the window and grabs her. Cut to the ambulance crew loading her into the ambulance her asking ""Wheres paul?"". What is this all about? was the previous scene a dream, and if so where did it begin? at least in the shock ending in F13 it was clear she fell asleep in the boat or was flashing back in the hospital ? so we end up basically not knowing what happened to paul or jason. or if they did stab him, or if he did jump thru the window. If he did, did her leave her alone and kill paul? this scene just didn't work. It may have done if paul was dead and she was on her own. Anyway, the main problm with the film is that the idea of jason not drowning and instead of just climbing out the pool and carrying on as normal, deciding to live in the woods the rest of his life and become psychotic. And then years later watching his mother kill loads of people and being killed instead of saying ""mum, I didn't drown!"". however, this continuity is small fry when you look at a later film where Jason is dinsitegrated by toxic waste in a New York sewer and then reappears complete at the bottom of crystal lake in the next film!",Friday the 13th Part 2

Like i said this movie is the same, a group of teenegers are in the cristal lake camp and jason try to kill them all, and he kill one-by-one, and that is all, because this is all the plot but really is ALL the plot, the characters are so normal don't have nothing cool, don't have story, is just jason killing people, i gave a 6 because the kills are good, have good soundtrack, a good final and is the 1st movie with Jason being the killer, but this don't have a true story.

308,lostanddelirious85,The best sequel.,9,28 July 2008,"This remains my favorite ""Friday the 13th"" sequel, with part 3 coming in at a close 2nd.The setting is pretty much the same as the original: a group of young adults gather at a lodge on Camp Crystal Lake for a counselor training course. And, as expected, someone shows up to spoil their plans.This is the first film that features the iconic Jason Voorhees as the killer, and it also happens to be the best. I don't care what anyone says--Jason was never scarier than in this film. I'm not getting down on the classic hockey mask, but the sack Jason wears in this movie is much more frightening.And as usual for a film in this series, there are some great kills and some very effective set pieces that ratchet up the tension. This is one scary little film! One scene in particular, involving two counselors that sneak off upstairs to make love, always has me squirming in my seat no matter how many times I watch it.The ""final girl"", Jenny (played by Amy Steel) is likable and one of the series' best. You really root for her to get away from Jason in the finale, and instead of running around screaming like a bimbo, she gives him a run for his money.No ""Friday the 13th"" would be complete without the end chase scene, and this one delivers--Jason chases the poor girl all over the place.This is way better than the original, in my opinion. Rent it for a party and put it on...you'll have fun, I guarantee it.",Friday the 13th Part 2
309,Halloween1247,Almost As Good As The Original,7,12 November 2015,"Friday The 13th Part 2 directed by Steve Miner is the first Friday film to bring Jason into the series. It almost reaches the same heights as the original.Months after Mrs. Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) was killed, her thought to be dead son ( Jason) takes revenge on the girl who killed his mother by killing her. Then 5 years later a camp counselor training camp is opened. As the group does there training stuff, a vengeful Jason Voorhees (Warrington Gillette) is stalking the campground to kill those who have come near his home. The previous main character Alice (Adrienne King) is killed off in the opening of the film, so that means that there has to be a whole new cast of main characters. A few of the side character are seen a lot in the first little bit of the movie, so it is a little hard to tell who the main character is at first. When the main character does show up, it is quickly apparent that she is different from the usual final girl archetype.The main character is Ginny (Amy Steel) who is not only arrives late, but also has SEX or is at least implied. The one thing that the final girl should never do. Ginny is also quite a step up from Alice, as she is not only shows personally but she actually uses her brain during chase scene. Not only this, but Ginny has had some child psychology schooling and so she seems to know what Jason state of mind is. Ginny describes Jason in a way that makes him sympathetic and seems more like a scared little kid then a force of evil. I find that this is what will always separate Jason from Michael or Freddy.Jason himself in this movie is not what most people are used to. Jason is played by a smaller guy and does not have his hockey mask yet. Jason wears a pillowcase over his head with an eye hole cut in it. I find that this one-eyed pillowcased Jason is creepier, but is nowhere near as iconic. One particular thing that sets this Jason apart is that he sets traps. He actually catches a guy in rope snare, which we never anything like that again.The other characters in this film are likable enough, but are none of them really stand out from each other. The problem I with them is that first they are clearly not teenagers, and second they have such bland dialogue. I guess that was the case in the last film too, but it is no excuse.The camp counselors all go into town for one last night of partying expect for a handful of them. The group that goes into town gets off scot-free, but the ones who stayed are screwed. When most of the counselors go into town Jason starts to do his thing.The kills in this movie are not as bloody or as creative as the ones in the previous film, but this could be because the film had to be heavily cut to get an R-rating. This film does not show Jason much until the end and so before that you only see Jason's shadow on the cabin walls or a P.O.V which helps create suspense. I think that it is this Friday The 13th film that trys the hardest to level with Halloween. It does not succeed in doing this, but it does give the feeling that they tried to match Halloween's suspense while still sticking with the elements found in the first Friday The 13th. Once Ginny and her boss and lover Paul (John Furey) arrive back at the cabin where Jason has slaughtered everyone, Jason sneak attacks and knocks out Paul and chases after Ginny. The chase is well done and even though it is pretty long, it is paced well and never seems like it is dragging on too long. Unfortunately, this chase has that stupid ""The car won't start ""thing, but a least it was foreshadowed earlier in the film. Also when Ginny is hiding under a bed she sees a rat under there and so she pisses herself. It is just so stupid and seems like a unlikely thing to happen.The Movie ends at Jason's Shack with Ginny tricking Jason into thinking that she is his death mother by wearing Mrs. Voorhees's old sweeter. I think this either means Jason is plain stupid or in denial. Probably the first guess. Then Paul shows up out of nowhere and fights with him, and while that is happening Ginny buries a machete into his shoulder. Jason falls to the ground dead or knocked out. Ginny then takes off his mask and sees what is under it. They then go back to the main cabin and Jason jumps threw the window maskless. He looks like an adult Chucky with half his face melted.The movie does not mess with the formula that the first one made and is not that different from the first one except that it has Jason. It does do the first one justice though, and is better than most sequels of the 80's.The ending is problematic as it ends so abruptly ad never really explains why Ginny was still alive or what happened to Paul.Also the film does not bother to explain how Jason found Alice or why everyone thought Jason drowned, even though they did not have a body to back it up. You can get these questions answered in the novelization, but on it's own the movie does not answer these questions. These points alone make this an inferior movie to the original. All and all, it is a pretty good slasher film and is up there as being one of the best Friday The 13th Films.Recommend to fans of the first one 7/10",Friday the 13th Part 2
310,barrosjared,Friday The 13th Part 2-What an Original Poster/Movie,6,12 February 2017,"Friday the 13th Part 2 isn't one of the strongest entries in the franchise. It isn't one of the weaker films of the franchise. Part 2 is in the middle. Run of the mill so to speak.Steve Miner is more talented of a director than Sean Cunningham. Although he is no Joseph Zito or Tom McLoughlin. The cinematography is cleaner, although many shots are borrowed from the original. The plot is basically the same, and includes a similar jumpscare as the original. Most characters are rarely worth mentioning. Tom Savini's creativity (for the most part) is gone.This isn't to say Part 2 is without it's strengths. Although it's a remake of the original, it's a better remake. Amy Steel is a better final girl than Adrienne King. Jason Voorhees is a compelling character (No, Michael fanboys, Jason is his own character). The atmosphere is pretty good. There are a few memorable kills. The pacing is better. The final act is no longer a William Shatner fight scene.And this film features one of the earliest skinny-dip scenes by the fan favorite Terry played by the gorgeous model Kristen Baker. Speaking of Kristen Baker, she is absolutely stunning as Terry. Despite her short time, Kristen definitely makes me re-watch this film more than I otherwise would.Watch at your own risk, forgettable, but important as Jason would be an iconic villain for the films to come.",Friday the 13th Part 2
311,filmboy280,Some of the best looking girls in the series.,5,19 January 2000,This is one of the best of the Friday the 13th series. (The best one is part 3 because of the campy 3D shots).  The reason why I like this one so much is because of all the nice looking girls.  There's the girl Sandra who's my favorite and looks like Natasha Lyonne.  Then there's the bombshell that skinnydips in the lake.  And a mildly hot girl is the one who likes the guy in the wheelchair.  Why do they always have to make the plain girl the heroine.  It's like that with the entire series.  The hotties die while the uglies save the day.  I cry when the nice looking girls die.  The reason I find this installment of the series so memorable (besides the girls) is because of the scene where Jason impales the two people making love.  A classic b horror movie.,Friday the 13th Part 2
312,rakshitchaprana,Satisfactory Sequel!!,6,11 October 2021,This was released back in 1981 which means that this is quiet old now but still the kills don't disappoint at all. Jason is still the same brutal as he was in the original film. But what it's biggest flaw is that it goes around the same plot as the first film did which means we don't have anything new in the story yeah there were some revelations made throughout the whole movie but that didn't make it any better. Overall this sequel does do justice to the original.6/10.,Friday the 13th Part 2
313,pendrell-2,A good sequel with not much replay value,6,9 January 2000,"I have to say first off that when I first saw this I was very young and it scared me good. The film has a great opening sequence, and a great finale (almost all the best scenes are in the final third of the film. The main problem with this friday is that it is pretty much humourless (Humour being the only way to entertain until Jason arrives). Without humour the characters are just the boring, badly acted, cardboard characters they are destined to be. Jason makes a great debut in this one. In this he is more of a really strong man than a unkillable monster. I liked that and also Steve Miners direction is really good for these kinds of films, he is always selling you the movie every scene through and the final third of the film see's him pull out all the best sequences (This movie has some of the best sequences in the whole series). Amy Steel makes the best friday heroine. She really makes this movie very enjoyable when she is on screen. So with the best heroine and the debut of Jason, the only thing holding this movie back is the script (even more so than most friday films). It contains no good characters (Amy Steel excepted) and it is basically dull and humourless. The plotting is also flawed, with there being basically no action till the final third of the film and little build up before it. Having said that this is still enjoyable first time round. Overall i give this friday a 6.",Friday the 13th Part 2

But since I'm not a hater, I usually like most movies, and this was pretty OK, but not exactly a good/great movie. After re watching it a couple times, it's the most boring compared to other Jason movies. I think it had a good opening, but was one of the boring parts. But then i think it got better, when they starting doing some funny scenes while introducing the characters. I think the characters were great in this movie. Especially Mark the guy in the wheelchair. I thought he was a cool guy and i wish he could've lived and spend the night in a cabin with that girl. The deaths were good and creative. Also i think Jason in a sack mask was creepier. And Jason being fooled by Ginnie with that trick was also creative. And of course that confusing ending if Paul is still alive. Overall Part II is kinda boring and stupid, but still good since I love Jason movies.",Friday the 13th Part 2
317,flipper-7,A scary night in Crystal Lake.,6,1 November 1998,This is the first sequel to the box office hit Friday the 13.This movie has a good plot for a horror movie.The story is set a few years after the orignal.A new group of campers are getting ready to open a new camp on the lake.The myth of Jason surrounds the camp.Most of the folks don't believe.Jason is out there watching them the whole time.The story leaves a few campers alone on a stormy night.A lot of the gang has gone out for a night on the town.Jason appears and begins his terror.I find this one of the most scary of the slew of Friday movies.It leaves you on the edge of your seat.The film has a good music score and the best chase of all the Friday films.Gore is mild compared to the later versions.,Friday the 13th Part 2
318,Firefly-28,The Scariest Of The Friday The 13th Films,8,25 August 1999,"For me, Friday The 13th 2 was the scariest of the series. The pillow case over the confused killer was very creepy with that one eye looking out at you. The chase scenes were scary, you never knew when he was going to pop out. The original Friday was good too, don't get me wrong. I just find the first more of a thriller than a horror. The mother was a living person who talked and it was kind of psychological. She did not wear any mask. She really didn't pop out anywheres. Therefore, I didn't find it all that scary but rather suspenseful. As for the series that continued, I'm sorry but I don't find hockeymasks creepy, it kinda distracts from the horror. It's like oh no there's a demented hockey player after me. Sure they may be fun to watch, but they're not as scary as part 2 in my opinion.",Friday the 13th Part 2
319,packfanman,War With MPAA,6,1 April 2006,"When the original 'Friday' came out into theaters, some people (read, the MPAA) were outraged at the level of the gore effects that were in the film. So, with Gene Siskel at the helm, the MPAA began a crusade to tone down the effects in horror movies. 'Friday II' was an easy target. At least one death (with a beer bottle) was cut out completely. The double impalement is seen in the film only from underneath the bed (when the arrow comes through) - however, the VHS box always tantalizes you with a shot of the spear from the top of the impalement - never made it in thanks to the MPAA. Not to mention the poor guy hanging from the tree. Although many slasher films were released the same year as 'Friday II', 'Friday II' got most of the MPAA backlash on the effects. Too bad these effects have never been put back into the film.",Friday the 13th Part 2
320,alex-ramdhanie,A Beautifully-directed sequel lacking nothing on the horror-movie standard,10,7 March 2011,"Friday the 13th Part 2 is an exceptional sequel overcoming it's successful predecessor by a cinch. Genuinely, I believe this film beats the first chapter. In my opinion, this is the best in the whole series. The things I liked is that there are many characters and they share nice, friendly chemistry together. Part 2 features Jason Voorhees in a graphically disturbing sack-like mask. It really scared me! I believe it had the most Jumps and the most sympathetic characters. The film was a bit brutal, but not coming close to the extreme violence of JGTH. It featured non-stop nudity, and graphic love-making. It was very excessive! The film's kills were very creative and unpredictable for a 1980's slasher flick. It was amazing! The last sequence was very frightening (to the point that could scare people badly). I believe Friday The 13th Part 2 is the best In the large franchise and it's highly recommended. If you like the first, you'll find the second better. I would rate it R For Some Strong Graphic Sexuality involving Non-stop Nudity, Some Horror Violence, Language and Substance Abuse.",Friday the 13th Part 2

322,JackBurtonsMullet,Not the horror classic that I remembered it being.,3,8 July 2013,"I am a huge mark for horror films and most of the time, I can look past the glaring moments of stupid that spring up from most of them. The ""Friday the 13th"" films have always been the ultimate representation of everything that mainstream critics hate, and die-hard horror fans love about slasher films of the 1980's. They're filled with all of the blood, guts, nudity, moronic characters and even moments of subtle brilliance that were always packed inside every 90 minute brain cell killer. ""Friday the 13th Part II"" is almost always held in high regard by hardcore fans of the series, but after watching it again recently, it's not very good, even by ""Friday the 13th"" standards.The characters are stupider, the violence is amped up, and it doesn't have quite the same impact as the first one did. Not that the first movie is flawless (at its very core, it's a blatant ""Halloween"" clone), but it had more of a charm with its low budget, Tom Savini make-up and gore effects, and its legitimately surprising ending. The sequel does have its moments, but it feels like it's trying to rehash the first one (right down to ripping-off of the classic ending), a formula that would continue for a good number of the sequels. When I was younger, I loved this movie, now it just feels like an expensive copy of a respectable horror classic. It's not terrible, but it's considerably weak.",Friday the 13th Part 2
323,wkstyers,Terrible excuse for a horror movie,1,13 December 2015,"Not a real horror movie, just another entry in the ""stalk and slash"" genre. So predictable with crazed semi-immortal killer and stupid teens who couldn't make a good decision about what cereal to eat for breakfast. All of this adds up to a total waste of two hours. Unfortunately this genre is what passes for ""horror"" now and true masters such as Hitchcock are forgotten. The problems extend beyond a pitifully weak storyline. In my opinion the acting is definitely sub-par and directing is what one would expect from a first semester film school student. The problem with this movie is basically that it is the first in a long line of sequels and quality doesn't improve.

325,PrettyDead,The Legend Continues: Friday the 13th Part II,4,6 January 2010,"Can anyone explain success? Does it make any sense? I doubt it. Mostly, success seems to be all about timing. Friday the 13th wasn't a perfect movie but it would have been a smash success just based on the advertising campaign. Because the accounts of crowds of movie-goers lined up around the block to see this film was all for opening day. They didn't know what they were about to see, but they knew they wanted to see it. That movie did its' job raising public interest. And the movie delivered exactly what the trailer promised. Cheap gratuity, a little sleaze, excess (the 70's meets the 80's head first!), and lots of violence and death! It is a horror, after all. Understandably, this would motivate any major studio to pump a lot of energy into a sequel if it would be easy to make. If the formula was easy to re-do. The story pretty ran into dead end. It was a classic mystery - the only survivor of a brutal massacre thinks she's safe but is attacked by an illusion. Was it real? Is it still where she left it?If you haven't seen this movie before, you should be really let down by something in the logic department. The son of the killer from Part I is dead. He drowned. In 1957. This is the entire motivation for the massacre in the 1980 film. His body was not lost. Jason didn't disappear. The mother had to have hard evidence that he in fact drowned. What's really debatable is whether or not the counselors who weren't watching him were actually ""making love"" or not while he was drowning. If Mrs. Voorhees was not able to save her dying son, and was working while it was happening, how could she have known what the counselors were doing while he was dying? In all likelihood, she was simply very angry because the counselors wanted to ignore Jason. He was deformed as a child. Unable to grow hair, he was completely bald. And the shape of his actual head was malformed too- teeth misshapen and crooked, lips and eyes and all objects on his face not symmetrical. And people in that era weren't expected to be very sensitive. Hell, just look at the 1985 film Mask and all the stuff that guy went through.This film is kind of all-ad campaign, just like the first. It knew the main appeal of the original was a formula that the makers of this sequel stuck to very closely. So, like the original, story was not considered that important. What they decided to do was change the original. Jason is a legend by local lore. So, forget what happened in the first movie. Because here, the whole town knew about Jason drowning and turned him into a bit of a ghost murderer urban legend even before his mother showed up to massacre the counselors from the first movie. There's a whole new story that goes along with it, too. Officially, only some people know about the whole massacre in the first movie. Others think the police have ""condemned"" Camp Crystal Lake because Alice fell out of the canoe at the end and for no other reason. And then, there's Jason himself. He was dead in the first movie, but before this movie starts- he's alive. And somehow, he was able to witness his mother's death and decide he must get revenge. Even though he was dead at the time.Is this where things get interesting? It should be. The movie mainly decides it wants to outdo the first in terms of sleaze and nude scenes. That's where I find myself being disappointed. There is a lot more sex talk and scatological dialogue, and even a skinny dipping scene showing the woman's entire lower half, front and back. If I really want to see female nudity and sex, I'll go get a porno. The blood and gore are trimmed to virtual non-existence, which is another downer. And Jason's look is copied from the infamous bag-headed killer from The Town That Dreaded Sundown. The movie does rack up a few legitimate points for atmosphere, another great music score, and slick new camera-work. But it's not as dense and scary as the original was at times.",Friday the 13th Part 2
326,icanseehimrightnow,My first Friday the 13th,6,6 July 2010,"I haven't seen a horror movie for a long time. And watching this one reminds me that these type of movies aren't to be taken seriously. The purpose of watching a slasher movie, is to watch usually obnoxious characters meet a grizzly demise by the hands of a scary killer.I already know everything about Jason Voorhees, that he dons his infamous hockey mask in part 3, that he doesn't show up until the end of the original, and that he is virtually indestructible. This doesn't quite show yet, as Jason doesn't seem very powerful in this film. The body count is average, though when i look back on it, it seems low. Most of the deaths weren't very memorable, and the characters were pretty stupid. But I guess you have to expect that in a film like this. There were several parts that I thought could have been fixed up.One that I can remember distinctly, was toward the end of the film, the 'final girl' stabbed a machete into Jason's shoulder, which he responds by laying down 'dead'. Any person will know that Jason will not die from this, in fact, can a real human being die from being stabbed in the shoulder? I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure it would take more than that, and especially on Jason. So of course later he pops back up attacking the 2 remaining survivors and a dog who I thought died (I still don't get this).Also, there is no main character in this film. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but usually the main character of a slasher film would be somehow connected to the killer, whether it be a distant connection or just that they've been in contact before, or she has had the most luck escaping him, etc. Since there is nobody, you don't really feel much for any of the victims, and usually it's most effective when you want the people to escape, but here, I just wanted to see them all die. And they did! So I guess I'm wrong here, this movie was entertaining, but as hard as I try to nit-pick it, there isn't really any valid arguments, since it's a 1980's slasher movie.All I have to say is that it's a ""1980's R rated slasher movie', and once you have accepted that, it is easily enjoyable, and NOT to be taken seriously. Watch it!",Friday the 13th Part 2
327,jeremynicholsv1,Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981),9,3 April 2015,"The first Friday the 13th was meant to be a one-time deal, but after it tore up the box office and made Sean S. Cunningham a big time writer/director, a sequel was inevitable. The issue was, and spoiler alert for those that haven't seen the thirty year-old film, the killer in Friday the 13th was Mrs. Voorhees, and she was killed at the end. The issue now is what do you do with the sequel? One idea that was floated around was to make more films with each film having its own story, but this fell through and it's probably for the best.So, the writers decided to bring in Jason, the reason behind the carnage in the first film, back to life. Well, I suppose it really depends on what story you believe. It's never made clear exactly how Jason came to be. If the viewer is to believe Mrs. Voorhees, Jason died in the lake so many years ago. Then again, why would you believe her? She's a nutcase! Anyway, either Jason never died and Mrs. Voorhees flipped her lid anyway, or Jason lived, and watched his mother get killed that night, and decided to get revenge for himself.The only real issue is, if he watched what happened, why didn't he kill Alice, the lead in the first film, at that moment? That's the problem with bringing Jason into the fold, with no concrete reason why, it's hard for viewers to buy his story. At the end of the day, we just have to accept that Jason is here, and he's in for some killing.The film takes place five years after the first, giving Camp Crystal Lake some time to recover. Of course a group of counselors intend to reopen the resort, but instead of going back to the scene of the crime they take up shop a few hundred yards down river. In fact they're so close that people are able to wander into the old stomping ground. Jason, now out for revenge, is there to hack em up one by one.Ginny Field (Amy Steel), our hero of the film, actually lays down some good analysis on Jason, what he would be like if he was still alive, and how he would think like a child even though he'd be an adult. It actually adds some juiciness to the story; sure there are plenty of scares and some good kills, but it's nice to have some steak with that sizzle.The finale is one of my favorites, as we come to find that Jason's kept a keepsake from his mom, almost like a shrine to her. All but two end up dying in the end, but creates some problems heading into the next film. As expected, there's one final jump scare at the end.What a lot of people don't remember about Friday the 13th Part 2 is, its not really that gory. Turns out the MPAA had it's way with the film after the first film was able to get away with so much. I never really noticed how toned down the kills are in this one, so if you're a gore freak, this one really isn't for you. On the flip side, I think, the less gore, the better the chills.Steve Miner cuts a really good pace here, and when the film slows down we get enough story to keep us going, and of course the music is spot on again here. The creepy sounds of Ki-Ki-Ki come back to keep viewers constantly afraid of what's around the corner.To me this is probably the creepiest Friday the 13th in the entire series. We don't have a lot of gore, and Jason is running in this one (not walking) and has a sack with one eye hole for a mask, which is far more realistic then the hockey mask from the third installment.Basically, Jason could be some crazy backwoods hillbilly out in the woods. The less supernatural about the killer, the scarier he is. Friday the 13th Part 2 is a great follow up to the first film, even if it introduces a problem with Jason returning from his supposed grave in the first film.

I quite liked it and thought it was at a good level of horror and gore, even though now I'm sort of over Friday the 13th. I think that they should of made this with Mrs. Voorhees but since they killed her off in the first movie, Jason gets revenge on the horny teenagers. The movie would of been better if Sean S. Cunningham returned to direct, but sadly he didn't and that was a bit of a downer for me. When I first rented it on VHS at my local video store, I couldn't help but notice if it was brought out on DVD, it would be better (as most times, it is) but since they only had the VHS tape there, I gave it a go.

332,prettyoddthings,"Short, effective, and entertaining.",10,3 April 2011,"The title of this review pretty much sums it up. This is simply a breezy, fun horror film with plenty of creative death scenes (none too gory to offend anyone sensitive), suspenseful set pieces, and one creepy-looking villain.Following on the heels of the previous film, this one takes place several years later as another group of young adults travel to the infamous Crystal Lake to attend a counselor training course. Only someone doesn't want them to finish...At just 80-something minutes (including a prologue), the film breezes by quickly and leaves no room for boredom. The murders are creative little vignettes that come along at least once every ten minutes to make sure there is always something going on.The acting is a step up from the original film and the production looks better, but this is still low-budget horror. Nevertheless, its minimal, simplistic approach works for what it is.There are some genuinely creepy moments in the film, and the creepy woods setting works wonders for the atmosphere.If you enjoyed the first one, you'll enjoy this, too.",Friday the 13th Part 2
333,Bleeker-R,The cast is full of surprises,4,14 June 2017,"The first Friday the 13th sequel follows the formula with more camp counselors showing up at Camp Crystal Lake and being slaughtered one by one. This is the first of the series where Jason is the killer, although he doesn't yet have his iconic hockey mask. He wears a sack over his head instead. He also gets kicked in the nads. Pretty funny, honestly.The cast is full of young actors playing obnoxious teens and twenty-somethings. Adrienne King briefly reprises her role from the first film before Amy Steel takes over as the 'final girl.' Acting- wise, Steel's an improvement I think. This one also has more cute girls than the first movie and more nudity, which would become a prerequisite for the series. The tracking shot of Kirsten Baker's rear end as she walks through the woods is priceless. As with the first movie, I really liked the locations they filmed at. Gives an authentic atmosphere to the film without appearing cheap, like most of today's low-budget horror films do. If you like old-school slashers, you'll like this one. It's solid entertainment that you don't have to take seriously, despite the macabre subject matter.",Friday the 13th Part 2

Has its share of sex drugs and blood easy to follow with a great opening. Amy Steel gives a good performance as our heroine and the rest of the cast is fine as well.This film moves at a nice pace has its jump scares and builds up nicely to the final chase.

337,slyraccoon95,Not As Good As The First,9,23 July 2009,"This film is pretty much a carbon copy of the first film. If you enjoyed the first one you will probably enjoy this one. This is a strength and a weakness. It works in its favor in that the first film was good and this is almost exactly the same (including the ending). It works against it in that you pretty much know whats coming and everything seems to be done with a little less finesse (which is unusual because this film had a larger budget).In my opinion Jason looks a lot scarier with the bag over his head albeit not as bitchin as the hockey mask.Annoyances: Jason is really uncoordinated, Some of the deaths are just wimpy (TOM SAVINI WHERE WERE YOU), Too many fake-outs, Ending was just lame and felt tacked on Good things: Jason's debut, Some of the death scenes are O.K, Ralph is pretty funny, The final girl can actually act (god forbid)",Friday the 13th Part 2
338,AllAmericanAssParty,The finest Friday film of the series!,9,14 November 2004,"Underrated and under-appreciated by Friday fans and Horror movie fanatics alike, the second installment to the Friday the 13th series is indeed the best. The film was a much needed sequel to the first that sheds new light on Mrs. Voorhees' son Jason. This film is darker and scarier than the first. Jason himself is scarier and more believable as a killer than his future incarnations which made him more zombie like. Although some naysayers claim this film is just a copy of the original, that is not the case at all. I understand the primary problem people have with this film is Jason's mask, a sack tied with a rope instead of his iconic hockey mask. My response to this? Skrew the hockey mask!",Friday the 13th Part 2

340,d-58784-88986,One of my personal favorite horror films of all time.,10,21 September 2018,"Friday the 13th is one of the most infamous horror film series of all time, and since I am a huge fan of them. I have decided to write a review of my favorite one in the series Part 2. The Friday the 13th movies are nowadays not that scary and a little outdated, but back then these films were horrifying. But to this very day this movie still succeeds at being well, scary. Let's start with the fact of how Jason looks in this film which in my opinion is a terrifying sight to beyond I would NOT want someone like that running towards me. Secondly, the characters. When it comes to people in horror films you normally don't care about them and just want them to die. But that's not the case with this film, Ginny and Paul are very likable characters. Ginny has a talent of child phscoloy easily fooling anyone, including Jason. She even has some care for Jason and is very tough too. Paul, is that type of person who you would trust 100% he makes sure Ginny is safe almost the whole way through the film and even somehow finds her towards the end and fights Jason for a little making sure Ginny is safe.Thirdly, is the nerve racking scenes. This movie has a lot of terrifying shots that will likely send chills down your spine such as Jason's erie Shadow reflection, him running from the police, and running toward the shack. Another great example of a nerve racking scene in this film is the scene where Ginny is running and hiding from Jason which is a full 9 minutes long. I was on the edge of my seat and getting legit nervous for Ginny. So there you have it. My personal opinion on Friday the 13th part 2. I have lots of more reasons why I love this film so I just listed the ones that first popped in my mind. This movie is a must watch to any horror film fans and you likely won't be dissapionted. So I give this film a perfect 10/10.",Friday the 13th Part 2
341,spknezek,By far most underrated Jason,6,3 November 1999,"By far the most underrated Jason movie it is both suspenseful, funny, and has full frontal nudity.  What more could you ask for in a horror movie. Not to mention that this movie is the first appearance of Jason the killer. Now I know the hockey mask doesn't appear till part 3 but that movie pretty much sucked.  Quite possibly the best Jason movie although Jason goes to Hell was a damn fine movie.",Friday the 13th Part 2
342,bigddy83,Not So Much a Sequel as an Equal,6,16 February 2004,"87 MIN- R **Friday the 13th Part 2 offers something unique that most follow up films lack.  This movie is actually better standing on its own two feet.  It starts off in standard sequel form rehashing the original for a good 15 minutes including the opening credits.  This basically means that the film is truly only an hour long.  Since an attribute of Part 2 is that it moves along nicely at a very steady pace, you can now realize how little of a story they actually have to tell.  Not that this is necessarily a bad thing mind you.  At least we aren't subjected to mind numbing scenes that offer nothing more than space filler.  Watching highlights from the previous installment is still more entertaining than lowlights from this one.  The movie opens two months after the original took place.  Alice Hardy (Adrienne King) has come back to the town of Crystal Lake to deal with her fears of what happened that night at Camp Blood.  Director Steve Miner does an excellent job of building tension to create fear and uses dark lighting techniques that at times have a style similar to that of a Hitchcock film. In essence, that is about the extent of this movie's ties to the original. It almost feels that rather than the original tag of Part 1, this should have been it as the rest of Part 2 takes place five years later. There have been many years of silence in the small town community of Crystal Lake and that is just the way the residents want to keep it!  However, Paul Holt (John Furey) maintains that this is the perfect location for his new counselor training center.  While most of the C.I.T.'s offer nothing more than hot bodies and grisly body counts, Ginny (Amy Steel) seems like the perfect candidate to make it out alive.  She's beautiful, smart, sassy, and most important, believes that Jason (Warrington Gillette) is real.  The kids are warned (by the authorities, `Crazy' Ralph (Walt Gorney) and also by Holt via a creepy campfire tale) not to trespass onto the Camp Crystal Lake grounds.  Of course this movie would be pointless if we didn't have two moronic teens who `just have to see the scene of several brutal homicides'. So Pandora's box is opened and Jason is unleashed.  Jeff and Sandra realize the error of their ways, taking skinny dipping Terri, wheelchair bound Mark, practical joker Scott, and horny Vicky with them.  While the kills are crafty and brutal, they lack the gore of the original and further more Tom Savini's style and attitude.  The motivation for Jason's recreational activities is quite simple: He is avenging his mother's death five years ago.  While the hockey mask has become a Jason Voorhees staple, here he dons a potato sack with a flannel shirt and overalls.  Like the murderer in the cult classic B movie `The Town That Dreaded Sundown', Jason is far more human and creepy than he is in subsequent sequels.  Eventually, Ginny and Jason have a showdown in Jason's woodsy lair, complete with his rotting mother's head.  Ginny is not your usual heroine however, as she uses her psychology smarts to beat Jason instead of the usual `all of a sudden a can fight like Mike Tyson' nonsense.  Missing from this movie is some background on Jason after the drowning and how he can to live in the woods.  Plus, several characters seem to disappear never to be heard from again.  Ted (Stu Charno) stays behind at the bar and doesn't return to camp while Holt appears alive at the end, but paramedics say Ginny is the sole survivor. It was rumored that Furey and Miner had their disagreements on set and Furey walked off and never came back.  Betsy Palmer appears briefly as the spirit of Mrs. Voorhees.",Friday the 13th Part 2

344,jane-cobb-330-765575,Better than some,6,4 April 2012,"Like most low-budget horror films, ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" is not a well-made film. The cinematography is bland, the dialogue laughable, and the acting...oh, the acting. However, of all the ""Friday the 13th"" films, this installment contains the most interesting story elements and the scariest scenes. Consider this: A deformed homicidal man-beast stalks unsuspecting counselors wearing a potato sack over his head; one crazy eye stares through a hole. He is territorial, keeping others off his land as an act of revenge over the decapitation of his mother (which he witnessed). He survives off the wilderness and lives in a dilapidated shack in the woods where his mother's head sits amidst a circle of candles and an increasing pile of dead bodies.If the filmmakers had handled the material well, it could have been a monumentally scary film of ""Exorcist"" and ""Blair Witch"" scale. Unfortunately, the underdevelopment of most of the characters and the noticeably lackluster aesthetic qualities drag this down into Bad Movie Land. On the other hand, there are parts to this film that are as scary as anything out there. Most of these moments are singular shots or images, and there's usually not enough fright to last an entire sequence.If you like the series though, you will probably enjoy this sequel as well.",Friday the 13th Part 2
345,Elwood-31,"Dear God, why make me sit through this?",2,13 April 1999,"Usually, as far as bad bad horror series fly, the second installment of the series is usually pretty decent, perhaps having the best chance to stand up to the original.  This film is a definite exception.  Where to begin?  Steve Miner's creation is much like Jason--deformed, ugly, and it smells really bad.  Apart from the numerous continuity errors and ridiculous cheap scares, the acting is just plain deplorable.  These elements create an incredibly weak, if not slightly humorous, movie experience.  Apart from that, Steve Miner also seems to enjoy throwing in scenes that have absolutely nothing to do, with anything.  Scenes such as the infamous slingshot-to-derriere maneuver and in general, the insertion of bad lines, jokes, phrases and thoughts presented by the actors do nothing but make the viewer want to cry and hide in a corner, if to only salvage his or her moviegoing integrity.",Friday the 13th Part 2

348,tonygersalia,Good enough,7,11 June 2021,"Ive been watching the Friday the 13th movies blind and I just finished part 2. Jason's mother was an excellent surprise antagonist in part one and the moment you see the shrine that Jason had built for her you can understand how emotionally etached Jason was to her and why he felt the need to get revenge on the councilors the same way his mother felt she needed to. I never felt surprised by any of the deaths, you could always see them coming from a mile away. In my opinion this movie was better than the original but not by much.

350,glouche,Great Sequel,7,11 January 2007,"Almost a copy of the original, this stands as one of the strongest sequels in the long running series, mainly due to the character of Jason Vorhees. The story takes place 5 years after the original and gives us a son hell bent on avenging his mothers death and/or continuing the acts he witnessed his mother commit.Taking the natural progression of having Mrs Vorhees son continue the work his mother carried out in the first movie, this is the film that introduces us to the horror icon Jason, however his character in this movie differs considerably from the hockey masked killer that would grace the next 7 episodes and the spin off Freddy Vs Jason.The 3 act structure of the movie is identical to the first movie (introduce characters, kill characters, and final chase) with a prologue and great shock ending (essential in horror movies since Carrie in 1976)it is in the prologue and final chase that this movie improves on the original.The prologue which gives us the back story before taking care of the one remaining survivor from the first movie is an unrelenting study in suspense with a great payoff. Sadly the next two acts fall short of the original; though the budget is improved the characters are not as likable as the original's and it seems to have had the power in most of it's kill effects edited away to indulge a 80's-era MPAA (compare the cruelty, violence and gore in this with such 70's fare as The Last House on The Left, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes). Act three however is where Part 2 stands above any of the other movies in the series, mainly due to the characterisation of Jason.Jason Vorhees in Friday the 13th Part 2 is a believable and rounded character, not the slow moving unstoppable Frankenstein's monster like powerhouse that we witness from part 3 onwards. From the moment that our heroine Ginnie (a great performance from Amy Steel) notices that ""There's someone in this F'ing room!!"" and Jason lunges towards Paul, we are confronted by an out of control madman who fights, runs and throws himself into his task with an energy unseen in any of the other movies. He is also not unbelievably unstoppable, being floored by a kick to the groin or falling off a chair, this incarnation of Jason Voorhees seems much scarier as he comes across as an out of control animal who is defending his territory rather than the kill for the sake of killing Jason of future movies. The design of Jason's world, from his ramshackle home to the improvised sackcloth mask all add to the grimy and believable world of a psychotic hermit who has lived in seclusion in a forest for years.Fans of the slasher genre should see this worthy follow up to the original and witness the birth of a true pop culture icon before he gets his hockey mask and becomes more machine than man.",Friday the 13th Part 2
351,thebrood1987,Essential 80's horror film,7,7 February 2012,"Really all the Friday the 13ths are essential to any horror movie fan. They aren't masterpieces but this series really captures the 80s look and feel and really captures a time on film. Campfire horror stories are my absolute favorite and the nostalgia I get from watching them is unmatched. I grew up being scared of Jason and now I'm still loving every aspect of these movies. Today's movies look and move too slick and come off as too over produced. They don't capture that eerie, weird vibe that most of these 80's horror films created so well.With that being said Friday the 13th Part 2 has to be one of my favorites of the whole series. It gets pretty weird and creepy once they show Jason's house in the woods. That is the best shot of the whole movie and makes this one unique. From that point on the whole movie gets darker and weirder. If it weren't for the popularity of the series this would definitely be one of those VHS tapes you'd find in the back of your movie store (back when they had them) that you were happy you discovered.Steve Miner did an excellent job with all the horror angles and imagery that sticks with you like the house in the woods or the mothers head Jason built as a shrine in his junk house that he built as well. Of course he has the sack over his head with one eye cut out that seems like the movie The Strangers took a thing or 2 from. Anybody who gives this movie a bad rating is looking for a masterpiece of a movie. Go watch The Shining or something if you want that. This is just a good fun horror movie that never gets boring to watch and one that definitely has its creepy moments. 7/10",Friday the 13th Part 2

353,Silver-Scythe,A Classic,10,12 August 2005,"This installment in the Friday the 13th series one of the darkest. It has a feel to it that the others don't have. Jason isn't an invincible, killing machine, he is just the bastard creation of crazy 'ol Mrs. Voorhees, seeking vengeance. You don't see Jason a whole lot like you do in the later movies, he's sporting a nice potato sack/burlap bag on his head and a dirty pair of overalls.It has some good kills, especially when the wheel chair kid gets it ohhh man, thats worth rewinding a couple times.Overall, its an awesome movie,definitely worth buying.

354,guillevillar,Best part of all,10,12 September 2016,"For me, Friday the 13th part two is the best part of all. It combines a very creepy theme by Harry Manfredini -which, by the way, is in my opinion the best horror theme up to today - with violent killings and some good scares like Jason covered with a white sheet approaching his victim like a ghost, or trying to suddenly catch a victim thru the window glass. Also, the fact that they decided to show Jason's dwelling as gory as it was, is very original and creepy. And over all, it creates a chilling gory climate of suspense without being grotesque or showing the insides of the victims. Of course, up to today's standards, this movie would be seen like an almost naive flick, but it still remains kinda classy and slick thanks to the actors, the music and the director, Steve Miner. One of the most shocking scenes, for me as a teenager, was when Jason drives his spear thru a couple that had just had sex. That image stayed with me for a long time!R.I.P. Betsy Palmer",Friday the 13th Part 2
355,danielbarrett-61105,A decent sequel,7,16 January 2017,"""Friday the 13th--Part 2"" is a worthwhile film for horror fans. True, it's quality is not on par with ""The Exorcist"", but the film does try to incorporate a deeper context, even some sympathy, around the iconic villain, Jason. The audience is even provided with an idea of how Jason has been surviving in the wilderness. In this sequel, a group of teenage counselors are attending a counselors' training camp near Crystal Lake, five years after the events in the first movie. Jason begins to target the interlopers using a diversity of tools and methods that keep each kill scene fresh. Near the climax of the film, we get to see that he is concealing his face with a burlap sack (the hockey mask doesn't appear until later films) which adds a strong menacing air to the character.One negative, in my opinion, is the extended dream sequence at the beginning of the film composed of snippets from the first film. I know that the purpose behind this was to review what had previously happened, but it seemed pointlessly long unless it was also a means of making the film a bit longer. Also, there were several jump scares which I consider a cheap way of exciting an audience's reaction. I personally prefer a buildup of authentic tension, but that is generally not the way in which 80s slasher films are built.Slasher films like this aren't meant to be thought about too deeply, but I do appreciate the effort to build a stronger story about the villain. Overall, this is a decent sequel and a worthwhile film for classic horror fans.",Friday the 13th Part 2
356,maxss,The Best Friday,10,29 October 2005,"My friend and I saw this movie years ago when we were teenagers. We both love scary movies, and have seen a variety over the years. Whenever the topic of scary, or horror, movies comes up in conversation, this one is always at the top of our list as the best of the best. The reason (s) being, the story was original enough to stand on it's own, even though it was a sequel; It is the first movie of the series that introduces Jason as the killer; and most importantly, Amy Steel starring as the movie's sole survivor was PERFECT casting . She by far, 'makes' this movie, and her acting is exceptional, making her character, Ginny Field, memorable... In my opinion, she sets the standard for all horror movie heroines. (She was also great in ""April Fool's Day."") Steve Miner's directing is also worth noting, as there are several effective scares throughout scenes of the movie. The chase scene in the last half hour of the movie is as adrenaline packed as a roller-coaster ride, and is more suspenseful than most big budget movies made today. This movie is not often given the credit it deserves by critics, etc. (you know who you are,) since it is a sequel and a horror movie, but Friday the 13th Part 2, starring Amy Steel, is at the top of my list for the genre. Thanks for reading.",Friday the 13th Part 2
