0,TheLittleSongbird,Worth escaping to,7,20 May 2018,"Will admit to not expecting much. The advertising didn't have me completely sold, was worried as to whether it would be fun or turn into puerile immaturity and wasn't sure about the cast entirely. Saw it anyway being someone who wanted to see as many 2017 films as possible, who has seen their fair share and likes films intended to be escapist fun, who loves the Jumanji premise and who has fondness for the Robin Williams film.'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' turned to be much better and far more enjoyable than expected. It may not be a masterpiece or great, but it clearly strived to be glossy escapist fun and succeeded very well in that. Do prefer the earlier film but other than the title and the basic premise 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' to me seemed like its own take and should stand on its own. Can see definitely why it won't appeal, and hasn't appealed to (though on the most part have seen more positivity than negativity), some. Didn't care for the first twenty minutes or so in the real world. It didn't have an awful lot of momentum in a first act that was just setting things up and took too long to do so, was awkward at times in the writing and the acting was far more comfortable and interesting once we got to Jumanji. Most of the performances are fine once the film got going, but for me Nick Jonas was very bland and while more subdued than he usually is Kevin Hart for me sometimes grated (though at other points he is amusing), the rapid loudmouth shtick is going to be a very acquired taste. However, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' was highly successful in its aim of being glossy fun escapism. The film is two hours but once we're in Jumanji they fly by. Although the story can be extremely predictable and the outcomes not surprising, the lively energy, the exciting thrills, thrilling action and suitably nail-biting but not intensely so sense of peril more than compensates.As do the witty script, that has the right dose of humour and surprising heart and even with the profanity from Hart it doesn't ever get too crude or puerile, and ace visual effects. Jumanji is colourfully rendered and mostly the film is nicely shot and more than capably directed. The music is rousing and pleasant to listen to and the ending is cosy and surprisingly poignant, which one doesn't expect yet it doesn't jar too much. There's even a nice Robin Williams/Alan Parrish tribute/homage touch, that is worth looking for if especially observant.Dwayne Johnson smoulders in intensity and charisma, in terms of acting style it is very familiar territory for Johnson but he does it well and that's all that matters. Karen Gillen more than holds her own with the other leads, with a good deal of sass and charm (her flirting/dance scene after being taught to do it is one of the film's highlights). Bobby Cannavale is suitably formidable villain, if somewhat underused. Absolutely agree with everybody who says that Jack Black steals the show, he has the funniest lines and moments (which are plenty) and it is perhaps his best performance since 'School of Rock'. The character interplay, which the film is heavy on, really sparkles.In conclusion, fun and surprisingly good film if not a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
1,Leofwine_draca,Worth it for The Rock,5,19 November 2019,"A lot of the goodwill surrounding this reboot/long-time-coming sequel is thanks to The Rock, who gives an exemplary - and very funny - performance as a nerdish teenager trapped in a hulking action man's body. The rest is merely so-so by Hollywood standards, but at least it's inoffensive and fast-paced, so there's little to dislike. Just not too much to love either.Compared to the original JUMANJI, this one has been updated a little to the video game era, and I did like the old nod to Atari. The plotting is one of the worst things about this, with a generic, barely-glimpsed villain and random action scenes utilising barely-impressive CGI animal effects. Of the cast, Kevin Hart is quite funny, but I found Jack Black bland and Karen Gillan to be completely out of her depth; the obvious doubling in every one of her fight scenes also gets to be a little much.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
2,SnoopyStyle,great fun,8,13 March 2018,"Spencer is caught doing the homework of the football playing former childhood friend Fridge. Self-obsessed Bethany disrupts a test with her phone use. Self-conscious nerd Martha insults her PE teacher. The four kids get detention and forced to clean out a room in the basement. Fridge discovers a video game called Jumanji in the basement junk. When they start it up, the four kids are pulled physically into the game. Spencer is given the avatar of Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) with no weaknesses. Fridge becomes the diminutive sidekick Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart). Bethany turns into Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black) and Martha into scantily clad fighter Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan).This is simply fun. There are good laughs. The chemistry of the four leads are amazing. The Rock and Kevin Hart have been here before. Their charisma is off the charts. Jack Black is great playing a girl and he has a great scene teaching Gillan to flirt. Karen Gillan has the quirky comedic skills in a super cute package. The only squeaky wheel is Nick Jonas. I'm not convinced of his acting skills. In that smaller role, it would be amazing to have a big cameo like Sly or Schwarzenegger. Nick Jonas is both stiff and lacking. It's a smaller role and a small problem. All in all, this is great fun for the family.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
3,Prismark10,A roll of the dice,6,4 April 2018,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is belated sequel/reimagining of the 1995 film Jumanji. There is a loose link to the character played by Robin Williams in the original.Jumanji was known for its CGI wild animal stampede, however this film shows how much CGI has come on from those days.The film starts off a little like The Breakfast Club as four diverse high school kids get detention and come across an old video console containing the Jumanji video game. The teenagers get transported into another dimension where they become video game characters different to their real world counterparts.Spencer the nerdy gamer becomes the muscular Dr Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) with no weaknesses. Fridge, his big football playing former friend becomes Bravestone's sidekick and zoologist, Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar (Kevin Hart) who must avoid cake. Narcissistic 'it' girl Bethany becomes chubby and turns into cartographer Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black.) Clever but insular Martha turns into a kick ass Lara Croft type adventurer, Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan.)The characters must work together to save Jumanji by returning a stolen artefact while encountering various dangers and henchmen.This is a comedy adventure with some video game tropes. I always felt that the original Jumanji was a rather clumsy fantasy adventure which did not get the comedy balance right.It helps that Johnson and Hart have worked together previously and riff off each other. Director Jake Kasdan, whose father Lawrence Kasdan wrote some of the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies makes something more than a cynical adventure film. He allows some character growth, such as Spencer and Martha coming close as themselves although there is a moment where Dr Bravestone does wonder if it would be better to stay as the avatar in a video game.An entertaining film which kids would especially enjoy.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
4,nogodnomasters,Press to Start.,10,31 December 2017,"This is a sequel to the original film and not a reboot. Having watched the first film is not necessary to view this film. In fact not seeing it may be more helpful. In this film four students in detention get sucked into the game and must complete the game in order to return home from the jungle. What made the film good was the characters. It was a ""Breakfast Club"" type of thing where four teens discover themselves and overcome their fears and shortcomings to form a winning team. In the transformation they become opposite characters from what they are in real life with the self absorbed Bethany becoming Jack Black. The film had humor, action, drama, and a feel good ending. Take the family. Guide: No f-words, sex, or nudity. Worst on-screen kiss for 2017.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
5,kosmasp,Jumanji begins,6,11 April 2018,"I guess you could do worse than hire The Rock to help make a decent remake. So if you are a big fan of the Jumanji with Robin Williams in it, this may feel weird at first for you, but if you can get over it, you will have quite a decent movie to enjoy watching.The effects are good, the characters are fun and while it might be a bit too weird and off at times, this still is entertaining enough to hold its own. It's a nice ensemble of actors and they all have something to add to the story. Some cliches will be served, but you always have that. It still has some nice touches for fans of games, which is a nice treat.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
6,jboothmillard,Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,5,14 January 2018,"The original Jumanji is one of my favourite movies of my childhood, I remember seeing it twice in the cinema, so it was surprising to find out there would be either a sequel or a reboot, having seen a couple of trailers I was certainly interested, directed by Jake Kasdan (Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Bad Teacher). Basically it opens in 1996, in Brantford, New Hampshire, teenager Alex Vreeke (Mason Guccione) is given the board game Jumanji by his father, after it buried in the sand on a beach. Alex ignores it, being a board game, but in the night the game magically transforms into a video game cartridge, when he plays it, he is teleported into the game. Twenty years later, four students at Brantford High School are in detention, Spencer Gilpin (Alex Wolff) who is caught writing essays for Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson (Ser'Darius Blain), who is also in detention for the plagiarism, while Bethany Walker (Madison Iseman) and Martha Kaply (Morgan Turner) have been disrespectful towards teachers. Principal Bentley (Marc Evan Jackson) ridicules the four teenagers and assigns them to clean up the basement, specifically removing staples from hundreds of magazines ready for recycling. The four find an old video games console, and Jumanji, the multiplayer action-adventure video game, they decide to play, each choosing one of the four playable character avatars, the fifth one is inaccessible, when Spencer hits Start, the four are sucked into the game. They find themselves in the jungle, each now in their game avatars, Spencer is now tough, muscular explorer Dr. Xander ""Smolder"" Bravestone (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), Fridge is short zoologist Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart) (he misread the name as ""Moose""), Martha is gorgeous commando and martial art expert Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), and Bethany is an overweight, male cartographer named Professor Sheldon ""Shelly"" Oberon (Jack Black). They realise they have been transported into the video game, they each have three lives, each of their avatars have a set of skills and weaknesses, and if they lose, they will actually die. They meet the game's non-player character guide Nigel (Rhys Darby) who explains their mission, with a backstory; big-game hunter Russel Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) wants to obtain the ""Jaguar's Eye"", a jewel that controls all animal life in the jungle. To win the game and go home, the players must return the jewel to an enormous jaguar statue and call out ""Jumanji"". Along the way, the group begins to lose lives through various means when completing levels in the game, but they work together to obtain the clues and continue on, whilst also trying to get away from the various creatures, and Van Pelt's men. The group are rescued in a game level by Alex (Nick Jonas), the fifth player, his avatar is pilot Jefferson ""Seaplane"" McDonough, he has been staying in a treehouse, built by Jumanji player Alan Parrish, because he has only one remaining life, Alex is shocked to learn that he has been trapped in the game for twenty years, the newcomers vow to help him get out. In the next level, they commandeer a helicopter and fly for the jaguar statue to return the Jaguar's Eye, upon landing Alex loses his last life after a mosquito bites him, but Bethany performs CPR in time, transferring one of her lives to Alex, saving him from dying. The group arrive at the statue, they find themselves surrounded by Van Pelt's forces and predatory guards, the five players working together, using their resources and skills, to distract the villains. The jewel is successfully returned to the statue, and they all call ""Jumanji"", the game ends, Van Pelt disintegrates into many rats, and the players return home, back to their former selves. Back in the real world, Alex is not with the other four, returning home, they find Vreeke household is no longer derelict, they find Alex (Colin Hanks) is now an adult, he was transported back to 1996, history was changed, and he is now married with a daughter named Bethany, in honour of the one who saved his life. In the end, Spencer and Fridge reconcile their friendship, Bethany becomes a better person with more socialising, and Martha starts dating Spencer, the four friends hear Jumanji's drumbeat in the school, they destroy it with a bowling ball to prevent anyone playing it again. Also starring Missi Pyle as Coach Web and Tim Matheson as Old Man Vreeke. Johnson also producing is always the reliable action hero, Hart and Black provide the laughs, and Gillan caused controversy with her costume, tiny shorts and a low-cut top, she is sexy and good at being the tough chick. This stand-alone sequel does reference the original, and has a nice tribute to former star Robin Williams, but it can be counted as its own movie, this one relies more on the laughs, the storyline is patchy but just about engages you, I really think it could have done with more danger, more creature encounters, but the special effects are done well, all in all it is a relatively fun action adventure comedy. Worth watching!",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
7,Tweekums,This never happened to the kids in 'The Breakfast Club'!,9,30 June 2019,"This film opens with the viewer being introduced to the four high school protagonists who find themselves in detention together. They are; Spencer Gilpin, an intelligent but shy boy; Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson, Spencer's friend who is a football player needing academic 'help' who are caught cheating; Bethany Walker, a popular girl who used her phone in class and Martha Kaply, an academic high-flier who doesn't see the point of physical education... or PE teachers. Once in detention together they are left alone in a room and find an old games console. The hook it up to a TV and select their characters... then they find themselves sucked into the game in the bodies of their characters. They also gain their characters' allotted skills.Somewhat inevitably their new in-game avatars are rather different to their real world characters. Spencer finds himself in the body of man-mountain Dwayne Johnson; Fridge ends up as Kevin Hart, no longer a great athlete but with knowledge that the team will need; Bethany is perhaps the most shocked when she becomes Jack Black and Martha finds herself in the scantily clad body of Karen Gillan... complete with martial arts skills. They soon meet a character who gives them their task... if they are to exit the game they are to return a gem to the statue it was stolen from. If they are to escape they will need to adapt to their new strengths and weaknesses and work as a team as they face a variety of challenges. It helps that they each have three lives but it is far from clear what happens if they lose the third... although they assume it means real death.I haven't seen the original 'Jumanji' but thought this would be worth checking out as the concept sounded fun and the four lead actors have all impressed me in the past. They may be very different but the film this made me think of was 'The Breakfast Club'; not just because it involves students in detention. Like that film it shows the characters are more than their stereotypes; something they learn when they suddenly find themselves forced to as characters very different to their own. The cast are all on great form and provide many laughs. It was great seeing Dwayne Johnson playing a slightly wimpy character and it was hilarious seeing Jack Black as a high school girl! Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan really impressed as well. The action was solid with good CGI making it look real. The villain didn't have much of a character but that makes sense given that they are meant to be in a game... all the non-player characters are comically limited in what they say and do. The spectacular Hawaiian countryside is used to great effect to make the land of Jumanji. While there are no real surprises the story is a lot of with its impressive mix of action, humour and great characters. The humour mostly avoids crudeness... even the idea of a high school girl coming to terms with her new male body is dealt with in a way that is unlikely to offend too many people. Overall I'd definitely recommend this fans of 'Indiana Jones' style action.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
8,BA_Harrison,We got fun and games.,7,28 December 2017,"I wasn't expecting anything from Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle other than some light-hearted Hollywood escapism, and that's exactly what I got: a couple of hours of pure popcorn entertainment with a predictable message to be comfortable with who you are and make the most of your life.A sequel to the original 1995 film (not a remake!), the film sees four high-schoolers tasked with cleaning up a classroom, where they find an old video console, loaded with a cartridge: Jumanji. Setting up the game, they each take a controller and choose a character, after which they are sucked into the world of Jumanji, where they become their avatars.Nerd Spencer (Alex Wolff) becomes musclebound adventurer Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson); meek Martha (Morgan Turner) becomes kick-ass babe Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan); shallow beauty Bethany (Madison Iseman) becomes middle-aged, overweight cartographer Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black); and jock Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) becomes short zoologist Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart). To escape the game, the players must work their way through the various levels and return a jewel, the Jaguar's Eye, to its rightful place in a huge statue.Aimed at the whole family, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is equal parts action and comedy, and largely succeeds in both areas, with some great gags (Jack Black, for once, manages to be funny and not throughly annoying) and several well-mounted set-pieces, the best of which involves a stampede of rhinos and a damaged helicopter. Of course, things work out exactly the way you imagine they will, but although there are few genuine surprises, the film still manages to be quite the thrill-ride.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
9,paul_haakonsen,Return to the jungle one more time...,6,9 June 2018,"Granted, initially I had somewhat dreaded to sit down and watch ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" after having heard nothing but bad reviews and heard bad talks about this movie. And let's be honest, the original ""Jumanji"" movie with Robin Williams was indeed a classic in its own right.But still, I went to watch this sequel with my wife, and it turned out that it was actually a blast of an entertaining movie, and they captured the essence of the old movie while actually managing to upgrade the formula to a more up-to-date recipe.Lots of action and fast-paced adventure in the movie, and it is mixed up with a pinch of comedy and witty characters, so what's not to like?The CGI effects in the movie were quite nice and used well. Which essentially made the movie not overly reliant on being a CGI special effects galore.I was initially a bit concerned about having Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black in a movie such as this, but they actually carried the movie quite nicely.If you enjoyed the original ""Jumanji"" movie then you definitely should take the time to watch ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"".",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
10,Quinoa1984,surprisingly entertaining thanks to a director who cares and cast ready to work,7,23 December 2017,"Heres one you can chalk up to low expectations, but a movie with the unfortunate title of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (and look I get it, people still remember the song and it plays with a trailer, but it doesn't play as far as anything remotely clever) is an enjoyable experience. This all comes down to who is involved and, for the most part, how the director uses his cast and resources.Jake Kasdan is not especially known for big Hollywood spectacle on a 100 mil budget (whatever it is if it has Dwayne Johnson and it's *under* 100 mil that's an achievement), but he is known for, to varying degrees of success, his work in comedies like Orange County and the underrated Walk Hard. Kasdan isnt a Joe Johnston, who directed the first moderately successful/hey-its-not-some-nostalgic-classic-its-alright original, so he only has a competent sense of action and effects (theyre not *bad* theyre just competent and adequate and thats fine). What he does have in spades is the ability to get good work out of actors ready to stretch themselves just a little, and thats what you get here with an additional treat: video game meta(ish)ness.In other words, if you pay attention to movies currently and have seen what The Rock and Kevin Hart and (to a smaller extent) Jack Black have done in movies, this subverts that since the concept opens it up; the pitch is almost like, I dunno, Breakfast Club meets Tron but, of course, in a jungle, as four teens (dorks, jock, popular girl, et al) get stuck in a video game during detention and take on avatars of Johnson, Hart, the lovely Karen Gillan and Black and have to take on a mission all aren't quite ready for. Though this does leave us with seeing arcs play out with the original teen actors bookending the movie, they're solid arcs for what is at heart a kids comedy, and it's a comedy that banks on us knowing at least some (if not a lot more) of how we see these actors, for the most part, and what happens when Johnson has to play afraid of everything and Hart is a football star who has his stated video game character ""weakness"" as ""Speed"". Woops.Thats the other thing, on the whole, this movie understands video games likely more than 99% of other video game movies (if one wants to count Scott Pilgrim vs the World as one, and I would up to a point, thats the only one that really digs deep into understanding and satitirizing video games, at least until Ready Player One comes out, that I can think of). When we get a flashback, for example, of Bobby Cannavale's sneering weird-iris-eyed villain's origin a character explains to another that this is what's called a ""cut scene."" There are also life bars on the characters' arms and the uncertainty about what will happen if all the bars are gone and if that means actual death, not just dead-and-come-back, is not a plot hole so much as it works as genuine ambiguity for what these people are in to and for us. And, again, every major actor here is up to so the double work of playing these teen types and what their video game avatars are supposed to do (ie Black's Bethany is a cartographer, to which she states at one point shes a map ""doctor"", so to speak I guess).This is a genuinely clever, funny script that shows Kasdan's skill at mining for comedy based on everything the premise can give him. And it provides a lot for everyone in the cast (save maybe Cannave, who is better than this but whatever he's screen presency) to dig in to, and the arcs for them while a bit obvious are worthwhile and the message of looking past the types into what makes you stronger or more confident or just not, well, a dick to people or others (ie Bethanys self-centeredness or Fridge's stand-offish 'i dont need to study' aspect), works. This doesnt mean everything is as funny as it should be, which is why I said ""for the most part"" before; Jack Black is given one note to play as ""ugh""-y teen narcissist and it gets a bit tiring when there isn't something completely genius for him to say (which is often). It's to the point where, and I never thought I'd say this, Hart gets more or just stronger comedic material than Black does, or knows how to use how we see him to an advantage or whathaveyou. There's also a fifth character midway through that provides some story intrigue and more stakes (it also is a good move via set up and pay off from the opening of the film which may/may not be following up off the original, dont know doesnt matter) and he is serviceable as an actor but doesn't stand out like everyone elae does.This might just be grading on a curve since its far from anything great and isn't without some logical jumps to make - yes, I say this, for a Jumanj maybe standalone rebooquel - such as a thing that happens with a life exchange that just happens and is never properly explained (I'm not sure without spoiling it I can recall seeing a multi-player game where that was a thing, though I must admit I haven't been avid as a gamer in a while), and again the action and actual spectacle is only impressive inasmuch as what's there as Kasdan as competence but not an original or striking vision (perhaps the one perk to Johnston over the next gen director, albeit time and money have changed the quality of effects). But if you are curious in the slightest and the trailer didn't turn you off and like Johnson and Gillan and most of the folks involved in making this, you may be surprised to see people who give a damn about what they're doing and the lines they say and how their characters develop within the limitations of a children's fantasy adventure. It's the B side once you're done this season with Star Wars's A-side record.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
11,tavm,Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was the first time I saw a movie with that unusual word in the title,8,27 January 2018,"After several weeks of not watching this movie, I finally saw it with my movie theatre-working friend who had previously enjoyed this. I, myself, had never seen the previous Jumanji starring Robin Williams so I wasn't aware of the rules of the game from that one so anything reveled in this one was new to me. Anyway, I quite enjoyed both the adventure and some of the humorous touches sprinkled throughout the movie.

14,CinemaSerf,A surprisingly enjoyable action feature.,6,8 December 2019,"This is a sort of gaming equivalent of ""the Mummy"" meets ""Indiana Jones"". Dwayne Johnson has his tongue firmly in his cheek in this fantasy adventure roller-coaster ride with a few nice touches from Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Nick Jonas as the eye candy.

15,zardoz-13,Sidesplitting Shenanigans Fuel This Frivolous But Funny Film!!!,8,20 February 2018,"Dwayne Johnson won't win an Oscar for Jake Kasdan's ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,"" but he portrays a riotous character far from anything he has done before this body switch saga. Basically, the Rock ridicules himself with a straight-face throughout this PG-13, 119-minute, action-adventure escapade that rarely takes itself seriously. As captivating as the Rock is as a khaki-clad Indiana Jones fortune hunter, co-star Jack Black overshadows him with his own bizarre character. Just as ""Orange County"" director Jake Kasdan lets Johnson poke fun at himself as a nerd cringing inside the physique of a bodybuilder, he has taken it a step farther with Jack Black who ends up in the body of female character. Scratching your head yet? These are examples of the sidesplitting shenanigans that underline this frivolous film. Abetting Jack Black and the Rock in this superficial slapstick are comedian Kevin Hart and actress Karen Gillian. They inhabit characters with whom they share zip. These likable characters make the preposterous premise entertaining. A mysterious videogame console uploads four high school teens and turns them into their gaming avatars. Each comes equipped with skills designed to aid them in an epic scavenger hunt. The time frame of the hunt depends on the participants' luck. Not only do a quartet of writers--Chris McKenna, Jeff Pinker, Scott Rosenberg, and Erik Sommers--segue this sequel to director Joe Johnston's earlier ""Jumanji"" (1995), but they also have reimagined it for contemporary audiences with no patience for board games. ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" amounts to sheer, harebrained hokum from fade-in to fadeout. Everything about this farce is far-fetched. Nothing slows down the headlong momentum, however, during these madcap melodramatics. Like the original Robin Williams movie, this ""Jumanji"" contains a similar frame story, but the writers spend more time on the subsequent story about the four high school kids. Superior computer-generated imagery in some truly outlandish scenes surpasses the primitive CGI in the 1995 film. You'll never forget the crocodile scene! Moreover, a clever premise allows our heroes and heroines to cheat death like immortals! ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" starts on the beach where the 1995 movie heroes buried the board game. In the prologue, a teen digs it up and takes it home. While he is asleep, the durable board game repurposes itself into a video game console. When he plays it, the game hijacks him from his cozy bedroom to an alternate dimension. Twenty years elapse, and the main characters are introduced. Principal Bentley (Marc Evan Jackson of ""Kong: Skull Island"") busts beanpole gamer and germaphobe Spencer Gilpin (Alex Wolff of ""My Friend Dahmer"") for plagiarism. Spencer wrote an academic paper for his friend, star football player Anthony 'Fridge' Johnson (Ser'Darius Blain of ""Camp X-Ray""), that Spencer had earlier submitted as his own to his gimlet-eyed History teacher. Meanwhile, an annoyed teacher catches self-absorbed, social media-addicted Bethany Walker (Madison Iseman of ""Laid in America"") on her smart phone during an exam. Finally, an introverted nobody, Martha Kaply (Morgan Turner of ""Remember Me""), refuses to exercise during P.E., and she winds up in Bentley's office. Bentley lets them off the hook with detention. Sounds like ""The Breakfast Club?"" Not for long! They must clean up a room littered with trash. Fridge stumbles onto that mysterious console. The four students decide to play this mysterious ""Mortal Combat"" game. Instead, they are morphed into it and emerge on the far side as their avatars. Pusillanimous Spencer is now expedition leader Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) with massive muscles. Towering football champion Fridge finds himself shrunk drastically into pint-sized zoologist Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart of ""Central Intelligence"") who dreads everything. Much to her horror, sexy Bethany takes the form of obese, balding, middle-aged Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black of ""King Kong"") whose expertise is maps. Shy Martha becomes butt-kicking martial arts sensation Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") with a flair for 'dance fighting.'""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" doesn't stray far from the vintage Robin Williams ""Jumanji."" In the original, the son of a shoe manufacturer played the haunted board game, and he vanished into it like so much paranormal dust into a board. Unfortunately, he didn't escape from the magic board game universe as easily as he wanted. After he returned to reality, he contends with a big-game hunter from the past stalking him in his hometown. The hunter traded in his antique rifle for a fully automatic assault rifle and lays waste to modern society as he searches for the hero. Later, a stampede of enormous zoo animals trashed the town. Nevertheless, the son triumphs over adversity. The ""Jumanji"" sequel differs in some respects from its predecessor. More characters play the game, and teamwork pays off as their best strategy. They are dropped from the sky into the jungle ""Predator"" style and ponder the three hashtag tattoos on their wrists that indicate their number of lives. Indeed, our heroes and heroines can die a couple of times, heightening the suspense, when their heroics aren't amusing us. The best thing about the new ""Jumanji"" is its gallery of sympathetic heroes and heroines. Smolder Bravestone, Moose Finbar, Professor Shelly Oberon, and Ruby Roundhouse are as charismatic as the actors and actresses. They are riddled from within by the guilt of their real-life counterparts. For example, you'll laugh at the Rock when he cowers before Kevin Hart. Remember, the man inside Smolder is Spencer, and Spencer is a medicating nerd. The scene where Bethany coaches Ruby about the rudiments of flirting is hysterical. Happily, Kasdan and his writers have given everybody a scene or more to shine. Ultimately, the success of ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is such that Jake Kasdan's comic cliffhanger may constitute more than a sequel but also a reboot!

16,grantss,Good fun,6,2 September 2018,"Four high school teens are transported into Jumanji, a video game. They now have new bodies, all complete with unique strengths and weaknesses. They also have a mission - retrieve a previous gem from an evil warlord and return it to the statue it came from. Unless they do this, they'll never leave the game.Good fun. Fairly original - real life people being transported into a video game, and ending up as video game characters with abilities and weaknesses and a certain number of lives. The video game setting works well and the plot is quite seamlessly developed from this premise. The disparities between the real lives of the people and their in-game characters makes for some very interesting and often amusing scenes. Very funny at times.Good action scenes and CGI too.Entertaining.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

18,view_and_review,A Very Decent Remake,7,24 December 2017,"22 years after Jumanji debuted it has been redone (well, it can be considered a sequel). Normally, I'm so apprehensive about remakes and sequels because they're simply never as good as the original. But this time I was extremely hopeful because the trailers were so good. In fact, the trailers were too good. The various trailers gave away the first quarter of the movie. There wasn't a punchline in the first 20 or so minutes of the movie except that I'd already seen it. That still left 75% or more of the movie to be viewed untainted but it did suck to be watching reruns at the start. I guess that's the catch 22. Because the trailers were so good I committed to watch it, yet those same trailers stole some of my enjoyment.Still, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was a clever remake. Instead of a board game it's now a video game and instead of all of the events occurring within your surroundings the player is drawn into the game. The movie provided plenty of laughs courtesy of Kevin Hart followed by Jack Black. As a story it made sense and flowed well. I still think the original is better but this was a good tribute.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
19,evanston_dad,Moderately Diverting,6,1 August 2018,"Moderately entertaining film that I probably would never have bothered watching had I not been on an 8-hour flight with slim pickings for entertainment options.Dwayne Johnson tries his hand at outright comedy and does a pretty decent job at it. He and Karen Gillan are the film's highlights, since they're the only ones who try to actually act, playing game avatar versions of awkward teenagers. Much as I like Jack Black normally, he's pretty wasted in his role, and Kevin Hart works overtime to wring laughs out of the script but didn't make me chuckle once. The less said about Bobby Cannavale's performance as the movie's villain the better. I know this movie takes place in a video game world and that an element of exaggeration is fine, but come on. He's nearly unwatchable.Grade: B-",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
20,AlsExGal,Entertaining fantasy adventure comedy,7,14 September 2020,"Four high school students serving after school detention discover an old cartridge video game in the school's storage area. It's called ""Jumanji"" and when they play it, the game sucks them into its world, where they each inhabit a different character: nerdy Spencer becomes Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), a musclebound action hero; football jock Fridge becomes diminutive sidekick Mouse (Kevin Hart); vacuous pretty girl Bethany becomes chubby middle-aged male scientist Prof. Oberon (Jack Black); and academically-driven Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan) a sexy martial artist. The quartet learn that they have to complete the game to return to the real world and their real bodies, but they each only have 3 lives in the game; die 3 times in the game, and they die for real.I saw the original Jumanji movie back in 1995 and liked it a great deal and I was therefore dreading how a reboot would taint the memory of the original. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The dichotomy of the characters in their real lives versus their in-game personas is funny and well exploited, and the conventions of video game storytelling and set-up are also lampooned with some wit. Johnson, Hart and Black are all performers who can be over the top, but the material calls for it here, and they all exceed, as does Gillan, especially during her hilariously awkward ""seduction"" scene. Even if some of the animal peril is blatantly more CGI cartoonery, it also fits with the videogame milieu. This strictly popcorn fare, but it isn't brainless, although it's a bit predictable. Still, it was much better than expected.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Finding The Rock to be the scene-stealer in the F&F flicks,and Karen Gillan being wonderful in the 2013 Horror Oculas,it looked liked the perfect time to see the last 2017 release (in the UK) still playing in cinemas.View on the film:
Putting the board game pieces into the games console,the writers (that include Con Air's Scott Rosenberg and Lego Batman's Chris McKenna ) play a wonderfully lean Adventure Comedy,that lovingly pokes fun at aspects of Videogames (such as the repetition from non-playable characters,and the game ""directing"" the player to the next challenge)with a humour that helps it to surpass most official Video Game adaptations. Tipping their hat to the original, the writers smartly keep the ""mythology"" to a minimum, in order to keep the Action/buddy gags swinging, with all the missions featuring a segment designed to highlight the helpfulness each friend brings to the group.Following the Adventure footsteps of his dad, director Jake Kasdan & cinematographer Gyula Pados use the limited real ""jungle"" location of Hawaii to create a thrilling,closed-in Adventure game atmosphere,where a new end of level boss hides behind every ""save"" point,and the action rolls with a crispness, allowing for every energetic finishing move to be clearly seen. Welcoming all to the jungle,The Rock gives an excellent performance as Spencer,whose action man heroics is cut with a sarcastic comedic line by Rock. Joined by Kevin Hart and Jack Black bouncing off each other as Fridge and Bethany (!)Karen Gillan gives a great performance as Martha/ Ruby Roundhouse,thanks to Gillan clearly enjoying the high-kicking action,that she nicely understates with deadpan one-liners,as they all find themselves welcomed to the jungle.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
22,FlashCallahan,Lacks smouldering intensity.........,4,16 January 2018,"Four high school kids discover an old video game console and are drawn into the game's jungle setting, literally becoming the adult avatars they chose. What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji...........you must survive it. To beat the game and return to the real world, they'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, and change the way they think about themselves - or they'll be stuck in the game forever.........Having never been a fan of the first film, I wasn't so keen on seeing this, but due to them having some brilliant chemistry on screen and off, Johnson and Hart sold the film for me, especially with the fact that the former has to play against type as a nerdy guy trapped in the mans body.Lest to say, the overall outcome is a tepid sequel that owes more to Raiders Of The Lost Ark than the original movie.The main problem is that although the cast do well in depicting their teenage counterparts, those teenagers are rather unlikable, even though they all have life lessons taught to them throughout the film.Hart is wasted in this, he feels really restrained in this, and whereas he bounced of Johnson in Central Intelligence, the chemistry here is non existant, and could have been a crucial part to the films narrative.Gillan is good, but she's nothing more than a Lara Croft wannabe who is good at dance fighting, even though the choice of song is terrible.And then there is Black, I've never been a fan of the man, he became too self aware after School Of Rock, but he redeemed himself with Bernie slightly. Here, it's back to basics with him, chewing scenery with every breath he takes, sucking the life out of everything he's doing. And the humour regarding his character is a little too smutty for my liking and really feels out of place in the film.Action wise, it's adequate enough, there are a coup,e of good set pieces that pass the time, but all in all, it felt all a bit 'is that it?' Once the film reached its climax.Add a villain that could have easily been avoided, and you have a damp squib of a film that really disappoints.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

24,Aaron1375,Welcome to a rather fun film,8,26 December 2017,"First off, I was not the biggest fan of the first movie with Robin Williams. It was not bad, but just did not click for me. When I first heard about this film, I had no desire to see it; however, when I saw the trailer and saw that it was now a video game and the people became their avatars I thought I would give it a go. Suffice to say, it was a rather amusing and action filled adventure that I was not disappointed in at all. Not the best film I have seen all year, but still rather good. I figured the whole video game setting would make it more enjoyable for me than the whole crazy stuff happening in the real world setting of the first film. The film is a mixture of comedy and action as I would say it is nearly a 50/50 split with maybe a dash more on the comedy side. The cast all did a good job as the actors and actress playing the avatars within the game all were able to pick up on the teens who they supposedly were traits very nicely and made up a lot of the comedy in this film. The story has the Jumanji game found on a beach. A young man picks it up and opens it up, but immediately dismisses it and goes to playing video games. Something happens within the night and the board game becomes a video game and soon the young man disappears. Years later, a nerdy guy, an athlete, a popular hot girl and a bit of an awkward girl get detention. They are charged with cleaning out a room, but happen across the video game Jumanji. They soon decide to play and each of them is plunged into the game and become the avatar they have chosen. The nerdy kid is now a brave and muscular explorer. The athlete a small and diminutive zoologist and backpack carrier. The awkward girl becomes a very attractive and hot video game heroine and the popular girl becomes an overweight professor and reader of maps! They are charged with getting a strange jewel back to where it belongs; however, they have limited lives and seemingly unlimited dangers awaiting them in the jungles of Jumanji. They have to cross the dreaded jungles, get through a bazaar and try to outsmart the villain of the piece and try to stop themselves from being killed in the process! The actors in this all do a really good job as they make the film. If not for the way they act, this would be kind of just another generic jungle action piece. Dwayne Johnson continues to be a solid actor and still the best wrestler turned actor as he has to play a guy who looks huge, but the actual person being a very insecure and scared individual. Karen Gillian does a really good job at being super hot and sexy, but also extremely awkward. Kevin Hart is very funny, but the actor that stole the show was Jack Black as the professor who the popular and self absorbed girl became as he actual seems like he is that girl. They all are what make this movie extremely good and funny. The villain though is bit of a throwaway, almost seeming to be no threat at all. So I enjoyed the film, at times I thought it did get a bit too serious and I did think it ran a bit long, but overall I really enjoyed it. I think it is the only non comic film I have seen so far this year at the theaters other than John Wick 2. The first film just was not for me, but I enjoyed this sequel quite a bit. I do classify it as a sequel and not a reboot as it is just a new setting as the game itself has evolved over time to become something new. The actors were great and though the ones playing the avatars are in the majority of the film, the ones playing the 'real' them were really good too. The film had a mixture of comedy and action, but though it was nearly even I would still say that at its core it is more of a comedy film. It was a nice change of pace and I enjoyed watching it with my parents and they enjoyed it as well so well done to Sony for making a very enjoyable film.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Can they get back alive?""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" (2017) is the third film in the current four-film franchise if you include ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" (2005). It was a surprise hit at the box office and produced an immediate sequel in 2019.While I give the edge to the original 1995 movie, this one delivers the goods for an entertaining family-friendly adventure/fantasy with a good message. The nonsense in the jungle is amusing & thrilling without overstaying its welcome. What really makes the film work is that it effectively establishes the four characters and their situations in the first act and wraps up with showing how they've grown as a result of their otherworldly adventure.Dwayne Johnson is always great for the lead in these kinds of flicks and Hart & Black offer comical support. Karen Gillan is cute and athletic, but needs to gain some weight IMHO. Meanwhile Madison Iseman (Bethany) has alluring eyes, but Morgan Turner (Martha) actually outshines her. The exceptional title song plays during the credits.The movie runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, and was shot in Atlanta, Georgia (neighborhood scenes) and Hawaii with loads of CGI backdrops.GRADE: B",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
26,deloudelouvain,That was a very pleasant surprise.,8,29 April 2018,"Well this was quite a surprise for me. I saw the first Jumanji, that was okay, even though I don't like Robin Williams. But seeing Dwayne Johnson was in this sequel my expectations were not very high, because he's not one of my favorite actors either. So the least I could say was that my expectations for this movie were very low. And it didn't begin good at all with the very annoying character played by Madison Iseman. But once they all been sucked up in the game it all became different, and in a real good way different. The genious about the story was putting the younger characters in totally opposed characters as grown-ups. The Rock as the shy nerd Spencer, the little Kevin Hart as the normally big popular athlete, the fat Jack Black as the highschool blonde sex bomb Bethany, the martial art expert Karen Gillan as the normally shy nerdy girl. Their characters were just hilarious when discovering their new abilities and body transformations while in their minds they were still the teenagers they were before. That is the best part of the movie, it worked very well, and it goes on during the entire movie. The story is more than enjoyable, with a good plot and very good special effects. Definitely better than the first Jumanji, and that's rare that a sequel is better than the first movie. For the moment Jumanji has been the surprise of the year for me. Not by being the best movie I saw, but by the fact I was expecting an average movie and that it turned out the quite opposite that I thought.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
27,Mr-Fusion,This game pulls you right in,7,23 May 2018,"A body-switching comedy disguised as an adventure movie for gamers, I have to give this (sequel?) credit for its cast alone. The original movie never did anything for me (even as a teenager; bad sign) because the CGI took center stage. And it's no less present here, but there's humor to be had in the school's popular girl being stuck in the body of Jack Black; and who among us wouldn't want the looks and confidence of Dwayne Johnson? The actors really carry this movie, but in the end, it's still an enjoyable escape. 7/10",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
28,siderite,"Fun and funny, but nothing special. Less dark than the original.",7,29 July 2018,"I can barely remember the original Jumanji, but what I do revolves mostly about the performance of Robin Williams and the somewhat scary parts of it. In the sequel (well, the sequel is Zathura, but you know what I mean) the focus is on the players and less on the ""lost guy in the game"" while the dark elements are kept to a minimum. The movie has been updated to 2017, with a girl obsessing over her body and smartphone who has to play the game as Jack Black, but her character felt really artificial and the jokes related to her were the most cringe worthy. The other three characters are more timeless: two opposite sex geeks and a football player (the American sort). Together they must overcome the challenges of the game to end the movie. Now, the story you know, so the details of the plot is what is important and I thought they were OK, however I must say that the game itself made little sense, with a pointless villain and a ""curse"" that affected literally no one. The actors did a good job, their chemistry, as noted by some, worked. Yet it seemed like a waste of Rock in this movie while Karen Gillan made more entertaining just by appearing. Overall a fun movie, but never more than what it was intended to be.I wonder how no one touched on the implications of entering a game then returning into a world that has changed dramatically from what you remembered going in. I mean, just telling Alex to buy stock in Bitcoin would have added a whole new layer to the Jumanji usage :)",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Jack Black is a RIOT!,6,21 December 2017,"A standalone sequel to the 1995 classic 'Jumanji', 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' never comes close to its evergreen hit, but is entertaining nonetheless. With an exciting theme, brisk pacing & a scene-stealing Jack Black performance, this Christmas Biggie is the one you should watch with your family this weekend. 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' follows four teenagers who are transported into the video game world of Jumanji, and, playing as the characters they chose, must beat the game in order to return to the real world.'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' rises on the strength of its perfectly done casting. Dwayne Johnson is charming & likable, playing an against type role of a guy who's scared of almost everything around him. Its good to see the Hollywood A-Lister take on a role that is completely opposite to his general buff image. Kevin Hart, too, is game & raises some laughs as the guy with the backpack. Karen Gillan is sexy & shows skill for some kick-ass action, especially her when she dances while beating up the bad-guys. But its Jack Black, who steals the show. His character, a girl in reality, is a riot. His feminine body-language as well as his dialogue delivery, to his hilarious reaction of having a penis, is laugh-out-loud funny. Black is in great comedic form, proving once again that he can land a joke better than most comedians working in Hollywood today. Its a performance that's bound to get the most laughs & claps. Nick Jonas charms in his part too. And the kids back in reality, bring earnestness to their parts. The rest of 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is pure fun. The pacing is brisk, the action is sharp, the comic moments of its 4 principal characters are mostly on point & the visuals are sure to please the kids. Its a big-budgeted blockbuster, that does the genre right, by never being anything else but a popcorn entertainer. If I had to count on the flaws, however, it would be the villain here, played by a one-note Bobby Cannavale, who comes across as a baddie only there to exist for the sake of a villain. But that's me asking too much from a family-movie, that actually entertains, despite its flaws.With Co-Writer & Director Jake Kasdan catching the pulse of this blockbuster & excellent Cinematography by Gyula Pados, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' offers a good time at the movies.

It is an amazing game, so well scripted that the audience enjoys it instead of looking for more than it is. The film at 1 minute under 2 hours is just about perfect.There's lots action and plenty of plot to keep everyone aware of what they are aiming for.

This reboot has four teenagers being transported into the video game world of Jumanji, and they must beat the game (playing as the game characters they chose) in order to escape it. The film stars Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, Nick Jonas and Bobby Cannavale. It was directed by Jake Kasdan, and it was written by Kasdan, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner. The Box Office hopeful has received mostly positive reviews from critics, but I found it to be pretty routine and mostly a bore. Four teenagers are put into detention together, and assigned to cleanup the basement of their school. While doing so, they find a video game called Jumanji, and decide to play it. The teens are then transported into the game, and become the characters they picked to play. They soon learn that in order to escape the game, and return home, they have to beat it.The film is mildly amusing, because of it's cast primarily, but all of the lead actors can do so much better than this (and I wish The Rock would stop doing silly kids movies like this too, and do more serious action flicks instead). Other than the cast though, there's little to no redeeming qualities in the whole movie, and it's mostly just a bore. It should entertain kids at least though, and it could be a decent family flick to see for Christmas (there's still much better out there though).",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
32,cherold,Fun bit of nonsense,7,5 April 2018,"I saw this movie on an airplane, so my expectations were low.

Four teenagers in detention find a mysterious game console and find themselves sucked into a strange world where they are in the body of avatars and must complete the game to return to the real world.The cast is quite good. I particularly like Jack Black's take on a teenage girl. Gillan gets a little blown out by her castmate's star power; it probably would have been better to cast the role with a strong comedic actor like Amy Schumer or Tiffany Hadish or even with a strong action star like Daisy Ridley. Still, I like her flirt-fail scene.It's very silly and very forgettable but it's fun and funny and does a fairly decent job of emulating a video game structure, although one in which everyone would want the same avatar, which is bad design.

34,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Strap in and press start.,7,27 December 2017,"'Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle (2017)' relies almost solely on its central body-swapping conceit, which elevates it above several other action-comedies with a similarly broad 'save the day' story. The fantastic, against-type acting really is great fun. The four major stars easily pass as simple avatars for the 'real', more-or-less teenage cast who actually get sucked into the titular game. You actually forget that you're watching Dwayne Johnson instead of Alex Wolff. The film isn't hilarious but it's funny enough, humorously milking its video-game setting and unexpected characters for all they're worth. When it gets going, it's very enjoyable. It isn't exactly deep, but - if you're willing to go with it - it's entertaining, crowd-pleasing fluff. Plus, it actually does a decent job with character development.

35,bowmanblue,You don't have to be a gamer to enjoy this film...,8,1 January 2018,"...but it probably helps! Direct sequels to films that are released a loooong time after the original don't have a tendency to do that well at the Box Office ('Basic Instinct 2' - anyone remember that?). Most times it appears that the original fan-base isn't in the cinema-going demographic and the film doesn't click with today's audience. However, 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' not only does well to differentiate itself from the original, but also succeeds without the inclusion of the man who (arguably) helped make the first instalment so special - the ever excellent Robin Williams.'Jumanji' was about a magic board game that sucked players in and made them play the game 'for real' in order to survive. Well, in this day and age, the producers of the film obviously realise that no self-respecting kid would ever play a board game any more (sadly, in my opinion - I love a bit of Monopoly!) so they've brought it right up to date and turned the board game into a computer game. So, when four high school students find themselves in detention cleaning out the school's dusty basement, they stumble across the 'antique' console and decide to kill some time playing a quick game (this never happened to the 'Breakfast Club' did it?!).Now, this is where the film gets a bit different. The first ten to fifteen minutes are spent introducing us - the audience - to our young heroes. However, as soon as they enter the computer game, all of them acquire 'avatars' i.e. in-game characters who are all older, hunkier and possessing skills required for completing the game. Therefore, pretty much the entire film is spent with the kids' 'adult' incarnations, but seeing as one such incarnation is Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, that's not so bad. So, our young heroes quickly become 'old' heroes and have to save a fictional jungle-land from a tyrannical regime. I guess that's a pretty standard plot for either a modern action film or a computer game. I suppose that's what this film is - a standard action film and it's enjoyable enough if that's all you're looking for or expecting. However, if you're a fan of computer games and the clichés that come with the medium, you'll get a lot more out of it than just a few action set pieces. It does brilliantly at poking fun of all the silly things you can expect from video games - everything from entering the game with three 'lives' to owning a backpack which can seemingly fit numerous ridiculously-large items in and never slow its owner down.But, however many 'in-jokes' are included for us gamers and no matter how impressive the action scenes are, the film would be nothing without the stars and I have to hand it to the four (adult) actors who take the reigns for the majority of the film. It's because of them that this film succeeds, for they don't just have to play 'their' characters - they have to play their teenage incarnations playing adult characters who are, in turn, playing clichéd computer game characters. And, as much as I love Dwayne Johnson in everything he does, I have to say that the star of the show is Jack Black. This is because he's - technically - playing a spoilt teenage girl. No, seriously. And he does it perfectly, stealing every scene as he goes. Also, you may not expect much 'character development' in a film about kids being drawn into a computer game, but I thought there was actually a decent enough 'journey' for the youngsters (albeit in their adult bodies!) to go on and they ended their story as different people to how they began it.So, if you're only looking for a run-of-the-mill action film to put your brain on hold to, then you'll certainly find it here. However, if, like me, you're a gamer and want to see a film that lovingly pokes fun at everything we hold dear, you'll definitely find that here to. Special mention to something that happens at the end. I expected something to happen between a pair of characters and it didn't. Something more 'realistic' happened instead and I found myself awarding 'kudos points' to the film's writers for not taking the predictable route at the end.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
36,ThomasDrufke,The Game Always Finds a Way,8,23 December 2017,"Perhaps unsurprisingly, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is easily the best video game movie ever made. Everyone who follows movies even remotely knows that's not a hard task to complete, but Jumanji earnestly gets that title from me by being self-aware, armed with charismatic performances, and an undeniably fun and energetic tone from beginning to end.The second pairing from Kevin hart and Dwayne Johnson comes as way of a sequel to the classic 1995 film, Jumani. Instead of just rebooting a beloved film 20 years later, this installment does feel like a standalone film, but in more than one way, it honors the legacy that began with the Robin Williams led film in the 90's. What better way to do that than get The Rock and Hart to team-up again for an adventurous action-comedy. Their chemistry, along with Karen Gillan and Jack Black are quite the team. Luckily, the film doesn't rely too heavily on Hart and Johnson's funny banter from Central Intelligence last year. Each character had their own arc and I didn't feel as though any one particular character was put in the background.Did I approve of all the character choices and humor? Certainly not. Jack Black is a naturally funny guy, but I wasn't too fond of his portrayal of a popular teenage girl. All of the characters are stereotypes obviously, but for some reason that character rubbed me the wrong way. Gillan on the other-hand, was much more in her comfort zone than it seemed like she was in the Guardians films. Her range of playing a scared and vulnerable young woman to be a ""dance fighting"" bada** was a joy to watch, and playing off of Johnson may have even superseded Johnson and Hart for me.Like everyone else, I was very skeptical of this film for the last few years. What was the need to go back and try to recapture the spirit of the first film? Well, they reinvented the wheel without replacing the entire car. Using video games instead of a board game seemed like a cheap trick, but it ended up being the best decision the franchise could have made. Where do you go from here? Well, it now seems the possibilities are endless. In all, a well-rounded cast, endless energy, and a little heart go a long way with this one.8.6/10",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

They've teleported into JUMANJI by game console which was something ""fresh"". Actors(or game characters) were also interesting. I have to admit this movie made me lough couple of times(like the look of Dwayne Johson was hilariously). I liked that creators of this movie decided to make continuation of previous JUMANJI. If we compare both movies(old and new one) I wouldn't know which one is better. Maybe the plot of the movie was predictable but I really enjoyed it and I would recommend give a try to this movie.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Anyways, this movie is about 4 teens that get sucked into a video game. In the game, their characters are complete opposites of their real selves. They must solve the mystery of the island and return this emerald to the top of some peek. Like a game, they have 3 lives and learn to use death to their advantage. Along the way, the meet, Alex, played by nick jonas, whom was a teen that went missing 20 years ago. He has been stuck in the game, not able to advance. There is some crazy CGI I can only assume meant to look video game listic. Like stampeding rhinos, attacking hippos, a den of snakes, driving a bike over impossible terrain. The tone is kept light hearted, trying to be funny at times.FINAL VERDICT: I think this is geared for 12 year olds, just too silly for me to say it's worth watching.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

It is sad to see none of the original actors or characters from the film but then again, that was over 20 years ago, so we can't really blame them. I still miss Robin Williams. I like the idea of updating the story into a video game and there are tons of amusing moments in this movie. The characters are really quite likeable especially Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black. The special effects could probably be better, but they're still nice.This movie really does have a lot of heart to it and I found myself rooting for the characters at the end. The ending is quite heartwarming and it feels well deserved for everybody. I admit I don't like the idea of all the creatures being inside the game and not coming out. We still get a lot of great jokes and playful jabs at video games in general. I was annoyed at how none of the creatures from the original film appeared in this.

41,lesleyharris30,"Ridiculous Family Fun,",8,27 January 2018,"Jumangi: Welcome to the Jungle is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific comedic cast. It is a very enjoyable, fresh continuation to the first Jumangi movie that, instead of being a straight up carbon copy to the original, it merely takes the concept and expands upon it in a new, interesting way. We see a group of teenagers get transported in to a video game and the adventure that ensues is as engaging as it is funny. The only major issue I had with the movie is that they had a very lackluster villain. I think Bobby Cannavale is a good actor, but there was absolutely nothing interesting for him to do with this character, there was no scope or development put in to him whatsoever. The cast is terrific and all deliver performances that are immensely unique to what they have done in the past. Dwayne Johnson as a nerdy teen, Kevin Hart as a nervous jock, Karen Gillan as a shy girl, and Jack Black as a loud, confident teenage girl all made this movie extremely ridiculous and impossible not to enjoy, they all brought it 100 percent to their part, and looked like they were having a good time. A very honorable reboot. An unexpected delight, Jumangi: Welcome to the Jungle is great fun that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good family film.

Internet reviews and comments made me completely giving up on it. But my girl wanted to see it and I'm thankful for that.""Welcome to the Jungle"" is neither remake nor sequel of ""Jumanji"" (1995). Instead, it only takes the idea from the original, approaches it differently and modernizes it, so the story has practically no touch points with a movie from the nineties. The screenplay is interesting, movie is visually great, but the main advantages of this film are the actors and plenty of humor. Jumanji is now a video game and four teenagers, entering into it, become complete opposite of their physical and psychological traits in the real world. When The Rock plays a cowardly nerd and Jack Black is a narcissistic and superficial girl, whose life comes down to Instagram, hilarious fun is guaranteed.

47,tabuno,Better than the 1995 original,9,27 January 2019,"Simply put, the sequel is better than the 1995 original. What really makes a huge difference is that the sequel has a consistent emotional tone unlike the more erratic original which waivered between comedy and horror and serious drama. The humor is also more rich in terms of gender bending and the solid comedy derived from the script instead of the singular efforts of Robin Williams in the original. Karen Gillian also deserves some credit for her performance and her ability to capture both her Jumanji character as well as the meek, nerdy high school girl. The only seemingly faint weaknesses come in the form of the overly dramatized motorcycle scene and the rhino scenes which could both been more carefully scripted in a more realistic formula (too many motorcycles and the practical speed of rhinos versus helicopters) and the to be expected but quite poignant moments as well as attempts at coming of age attitudinal changes that in a few places almost came across more superficially brief than genuine. Nevertheless, this sequel succeeds well in this depiction of a video game and tantalizing use of special character powers and game lives. The pacing, the fun irony, the action, the human messages, and the performances all come together in this entertaining and captivating movie.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

What I mean by that is its predictible, it's flashy, it's loud and has all the usual tropes that you'd expect.Don't get me wrong I'm not saying that's entirely a bad thing, at least it has fantastic production values but sadly it means it lacks in originality and has no real identity of it's own.Telling the story of 4 teenagers who get pulled into Jumanji, yet this time it's updated and has become a video game!Plenty of comedy, both hit and miss, the stunning Miss Gillan on show and Jack Black for the first time in years actually reminding us why we used to love him.It goes without saying that I prefer the first movie but credit where credit is due Welcome To The Jungle did exceed my expectations as I think I subconciously went in expecting and perhaps wanting to hate it.Nothing special, all flash with little filler.

50,The-Sarkologist,Game On,7,15 January 2018,"In a way I'm not surprised that they have brought the classic boardgame that transports the players into a jungle world of danger and adventure into the 21st Century. In a way the old board games have gone out the window and now video games are all the rage, so when the game is uncovered on the beach one day and brought home and given to a teenager, he tosses it into the corner and says 'nobody plays board games anymore!' (which is not entirely true because there is still an entire industry focused around boardgames, but that is another story). So, to keep itself relevant, the game transforms itself into a computer cartridge.
 So, we have these four high school students - tropes if you will because they all fall into the same categories: Nerd, Jock, Pretty Girl and Awkward girl. The catch is (and you would have worked this out from the trailers) that when they are dragged into the game they don't necessarily fall into the same roles. For instance, the nerd become the hulking leader of the group that has this awe of awesomeness, while the jock ends up as a zoologist with a back pack. Oh, and one of girls ends up being a guy (played by Jack Black of all people, but then again I wouldn't have expected anything less), and I am pretty sure you can work out which one that is.
 I'm going to say that this was a pretty fun movie. In a way it borrows a lot from Indiana Jones, but then again so did the original movie. Still, I can hardly say that Indiana is all that original because the concept goes as far back as King Solomon's Mines (the book, not the movie). However, even though it is nothing all that original (ignoring the fact that it is a sequel/remake, though I suspect that it is more a sequel), it is still a pretty fun, and rather amusing, film to watch.
 In fact it is one of those films that could appeal to adults and children, with aspects of it being rather subtle in the humour, and of course the jokes where the pretty girl on campus suddenly discovers that she happens to be a man. In a lot of cases it is a film about teamwork, but it is also one of those rather fun adventure movies where you can pretty much turn your mind off for an hour and a half or so. Anyway, Dwayne Johnson does come out pretty well, especially since he plays a nerd trapped in the body of a typical hollywood hero.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

53,cruise01,"Jumanji is pure fun, action packed, and entertaining characters. May not be as great as the original. But still a lot of fun to be had.",8,23 December 2017,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fun comedy action film that has a great ensemble like Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan. And a whole lot of action to keep you entertained. Now does it succeed over the original film that has the beloved Robin Williams? No, I still loved the original film and also because the idea of a board game bringing real threats to the world from big spiders, a herd of elephants breaking through a house, and a flash storm in the living room. I thought this film was still good and fun. And it is a sequel to the original. But once you hear the jumanji drum rolls it sure does bring back memories from the original. The film starts with a teenager finding a board game on the beach in 1996. However, like he said, who plays board games and sets it aside as he continues to play video games. Overnight, the teen disappears and all is left is a jumanji video game. Now, 20 or so years later, Spencer (Alex Wolff), Bethany (Madison Iseman), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), and Martha (Morgan Turner) are all on detention in high school and are suppose to clean up the basement. Til they discover a Jumanji video game. They play and get thrown into the world of Jumanji as avatars like Dr. Smolder (Dwayne Johnson), Shelly (Jack Black), Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), and Mouse (Kevin Hart). They have to play the game and search for the missing eye of Jumanji to break the curse.The film is a lot of fun and it has some fun humor. Alex Wolff playing the nerdy teen. Madison Iseman playing a self centered popular teen, which she is obsessed with taking selfies and posting it. Ser'Darius Blain a jocky student. And Morgan Turner plays the awkward teen, who is sheltered from everyone. Then, the avatar versions of these characters like Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Kevin Hart were all fun and great. There is some exciting fun action as these characters travel the world of Jumanji. Being chased by the villain Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) biker goons as they are on the search for the eye. With a beastly Johnson punching guys through walls, and Karen Gillan dance fighting skills. They make a great combo. Black is more of a navigator with map reading skills and Hart is a weapon specialist. It is interesting to see how the world of Jumanji is. But at the same time, I miss the original idea of a board game coming to life. This film has action, bad guys chasing the good on motorcycles. The good guys walking through each stage of the game from death trap hallways, a stampede of rhinos and a helicopter chase, and being chased by Jaguars. If this film were a stand alone, it would have been better with no comparison. There is also some fun humor with these characters. Penis jokes on one male character that a girl is playing as. And seeing Jack Black teaching Karen Gillan how to flirt was hilarious. There is plenty of more with these characters. Overall, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a good action adventure film. It is a fun addition to the original. The cast was great. It has plenty of action and humor to keep you entertained. The plot was also good seeing the world of Jumanji and modernizing the game as a video game. But nowhere as great as the original.I rate the film 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend seeing the film in theatres it is fun for the whole family if you seen the original or not.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
54,Floated2,Strong performances exceeds expectations,8,11 April 2019,"Having heard much about this film, knowing somewhat of its history based on the original Jumanji (released in 1995), this remake/sequel delivers more and better than have expected. What makes this film work is the script and overall character performances. Lead by Dwayne the Rock Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan, the chemistry among them is the undersell.The action blends in well with the comedy, as it isn't too vulgar and not too silly but with a well balance between clever and some silly gags. It also doesn't completely force itself like many comedies do nowadays. Most of the comedy does come from the characters interactions among themselves as well as the situation they are in.A sequel to this film was inevitable due to the amount of money this movie made at the box, which appears to be coming out towards the end of this year. Now it somewhat feels like a rush and people will of course expect something as great or on par as this film, which is why I think the sequel won't be as good. Simply because what more can they improve on, and how to keep it fresh. Only speculation but hoping for the best for the sequel of course. No doubt it will be a big success (perhaps not as big as this film but none the less it should still be a hit). Highly recommend",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
55,leonblackwood,Enjoyable but it could have been much better!,6,3 May 2018,"The Review:
I was in two minds about this remake, mainly because I really enjoyed the original but I must admit, I liked what they done with the storyline. Some of the slapstick comedy wasn't that great, and I personally think that they could have done much more with the concept but I still enjoyed the movie, and the chemistry between the various characters was amusing. The CGI was also quite impressive, and I liked the twist when they went into the game but once the shock element went out the window, it seemed to go downhill. Anyway, the movie is based on 4 characters, Spencer (Dwayne Johnson, Martha (Karen Gillan), Fridge (Kevin Hart) and Bethany (Jack Black), who have all been given detention at school. Whilst on detention in the basement of the school, they come across an old video game, which turns out to be Jumanji, so they connect it to a TV and they decide to play it. After picking there various characters, the 4 teenagers get transported into the game, and they change into the characters that they have picked. Once they work out what has happened, Nigel (Rhys Darby), explains to them that they have to retrieve the Jaguar's Eye from a corrupt archaeologist, Russell Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), which they have to return to a Jaguar statue to leave the game. Whilst on there mission, they come across another teenager, Alex (Nick Jonas), who has been stuck in the game for 20 years, so they join forces to get the priceless relic, so they can return it to it's rightful place. The various characters all bring something different to the movie, and I liked the fact that Jack Black was actually a girl. The Rock just had to be the brave one, which wasn't surprising but Kevin Hart was quite funny as the Fridge. Although I found the movie entertaining, the humour was a bit too safe for me and a lot of the scenes were pretty far fetched. With that aside, I would watch the movie again, and I can appreciate that the director tried something different with a great concept but I still think that it could have been much better. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Jake Kasdan, who also brought you Sex Tape starring Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel, Bad Teacher, which also starred Cameron Diaz, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, The TV Set, Orange County and Zero Effect. Judging by his previous movies, he's obviously come from a comedy background, so this project was slightly out of his comfort zone. He's also worked on various TV series, like Freaks & Geeks, Grosse Pointe, Undeclared, Cracking Up, New Girl and the Grinder, and he is due to make another Bad Teacher movie, which is in development. For a remake, this movie certainly blew up at the box office, and it's made the Rock one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood today but for it's time, the original is still better in my eyes, even though it only made $263million at the box office, with a $65million budget. Budget: $90million

56,TheMovieDiorama,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle plays out like a classic video game, very linear with the occasional glitch.",6,24 February 2018,"If someone said to me ""Luke, there's a Jumanji sequel coming out..."" I would've laughed and shouted ""Objection!"". Yet, here we are and guess what? It doesn't suck! The same concept as the original but substituting the board game with a retro video game from 1996. Four students are magically transported into the game where they must place a jewel at the head of a jaguar mountain in order to save Jumanji. Fortunately the creators didn't rehash the exact same idea, instead they implemented a modern twist to it. That is the sequel's strength, deconstructing how video games function. Back in my youth when I aspired to be a video game developer, I self-taught all the elements into making a game. NPCs, avatars, levels, respawning etc. so their inclusion in this felt like a little nod to me which brought a gleeful smile to my face. This re-imagination focussed on comedy and action, the fantasy traits from the original have been put to one side. Whilst the comedy is hit and miss (mostly miss) and the action is plagued with CGI...I was still entertained. Jack Black was the standout as he portrays a girl in a middle aged man's body, had me laugh quite a few times. Dwayne Johnson was likeable as ever, but then again so were everyone else. The differing character archetypes and the ""you can be whoever you want to be"" moral felt extremely forced and all too familiar. Include the plot linearity, pointless antagonist and lack of pop songs (honestly, would've been more appropriate than an original musical score) and you have yourself a good film. Not great, but highly watchable. Maybe that is just what audiences needed, to which I cannot complain. A pleasant surprise is how I would describe this. Was just waiting for Guns N' Roses to play...waited patiently...the film was ending in its incredibly cringeworthy eye rolling way...and...YES! Credits song!

To The Rock's credit it doesn't.

59,matthewssilverhammer,"Well, That Was a Good Time",7,29 December 2017,"The original Jumanji was released in 1995 to mediocre reviews and massive box office. Like Space Jam and Casper, it was a 90s kids movies that is very of its time: high-concept, slightly obnoxious, technologically advanced, and drenched in unimaginative jokes. So not only is it surprising for us to be getting a sequel 20 years later, with none of the original cast and very little actual connection to its source, it's even more surprising that it's this old-fashioned and good. Easily the best video game film I've seen, it's the kind of corny, good-natured fun we rarely get anymore.
Four teenagers come across an old video game system, which sucks them into the jungle world of Jumanji, giving them the avatar bodies of The Rock, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan. Much of the entertainment comes from the body-swap and fish-out-of-water humor. Still, the fantasy story is refreshingly decent, with the constructs of a video game leading the both the plot and the comedy.
Most impressive is the story's willingness to slow down to let the characters jokes and relationships shine. The performers are perfectly cast, with Rock and Black really shining. Each captures the personality of their teen counterpart with surprising accuracy, except Hart, who still manages plenty of laughs without the actual commitment to his character. 
It's all just more well-thought out than it has any right to be. The action scenes are clear and engaging. The dialogue is solid and memorably funny. There are multiple scenes that standout among the comedy of 2017 films. So when the movie falls into contrivance sporadically, it's all-the-more disappointing. Still, this Jumanji is a perfect way to cap-off the year-in-movies: with a turn-off-your-cynicism, good-time family adventure comedy.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
60,Vartiainen,Above average popcorn entertainment,6,4 March 2018,"You know what, in this age of endless remakes and soft reboots, I actually think that a sequel to Jumanji is not actually all that terrible an idea. I mean, the original 1995 adventure film already hinted at possible sequels with its ending and the story and the world of Jumanji is such that you can tell countless stories with it. Plus, it also has the fact going for it that the original film was not a great one. I mean, it's good and nowadays more than nostalgic, but it's not a masterpiece. There is room for improvement here.And while I do not think that this film surpasses the original, it does come very close to matching it in quality. It keeps the lighthearted, tongue in cheek tone of the original, updates the visuals, changes the story enough to remain interesting, while still wholeheartedly feeling like a Jumanji story.What I liked the most were the actors. The ones playing the actual teenagers were okay, even if their characters are about as three-dimensional as the original Super Mario Bros game. But it's the characters playing the game characters that are the saving grace here. From Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan as two invincible heroes to Jack Black and Kevin Hart as their bumbling sidekicks. The fact that they have to act like they're being controlled by teenagers is admittedly a cheap joke, but it's a joke that keeps on giving. Especially Black as a self-centered queen bee brat.And that's actually the perfect way to sum up the film. Its humour and entertainment value are... cheap... -ish, no way around it, but it's just the right kind of cheap. Perhaps I do miss the more serious moments and actual drama of the original just a little bit, and I cannot say that the film gets modern teenagers particularly well, but on the other hand the action scenes are better, the locations are more interesting and it's simply too much fun to disdain in any meaningful way.Grab a bucket of popcorn, pop a soda, lean back and take a trip to the jungles of Jumanji.

This time the film takes place with the board game being found by a guy in 1996 who plays a video game one night only for the board game to transfer itself into the game and causing the boy to get sucked into his console. 20 years later and we meet 4 teens who end up in detention and Fridge finds the game console but once Fridge,Bethany,Martha and Spencer choose their avatars the 4 get sucked in the game as their chosen avatars. Martha is the feisty Ruby,Spencer is the handsome Dr Smoulder,Fridge is Finbar Moose and Bethany ends up being a obese man named Shelley.So it's up to the 4 along with a mysterious pilot named Alex played by Nick Jonas to finish the game. Starring Dwanye Johnson and Kevin Hart from Central Intelligence,Karen Gilliam former Doctor Who ,and Jack Black from School of Rock who all 4 play the teens avatars this film is definetly a feel good flick. Although I prefer the 1995 classic with the later Robin Williams I still enjoyed this one too.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
63,subxerogravity,It's a fun popcorn eater to watch with the most electrifying cast.,8,22 December 2017,"I've seen the original movie once or twice as a kid but don't recall it well enough to do a comparison.I do love the update of Junmanji adapting itself to a video game over a board game (but I do know lots of kids who still play board games). This was the second time Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart teamed up in a movie together. The first being Central Intelligence, though you can't go wrong with a little Hart and one big Johnson, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was a better fit for them than Central Intelligence, even without Hart and Johnson's help from some star power like Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas.So just like with the original film, a few kids find some old game and begin to play it, only to get sucked into the game they are playing. Keeping with the video game tone the kids become the avatars they select. So this kid name Spencer, who in real life is a little nerd, gets to become The Rock, who plays Dr. Smolder Bravestone, not much of a doctor of anything but he's got strength, speed, and no weaknesses, so like I said, he becomes the Rock, and what kid does not want to become the Rock, right? (hell I'm a grown man and I want to become The Rock)Not all the other kids are as lucky with the avatars they randomly selected. 6 feet tall high school football star, becomes 5'3"" Kevin Hart, who plays Moose Finbar, and acts as Bravestone's weapons holder. Not that being Kevin Hart, who is funny and rich would not be cool, but not really something I've dreamed about, but it could be worse, you could be Bethany, a cute and shallow teenage girl who picks the avatar Shelly Oberon, who happens to be a fat middle age man. Some of the best laughs of the movie do come from Black playing a girl discovering the advantages and disadvantages of being a dude.Then we have Karen Gillan, as the avatar Ruby Roundhouse, a total jab at the female stereotypes in video games, a hot chick who can kick butt, but is not wearing enough clothing, which makes the user Martha uncomfortable.The movie is all about what it would be like to truly live out the game as the characters treat each adventure like a level in the video game and have to overcome these adventures without loosing the three lives they are given.It does not make for much character development. Each person comes into the game with with certain issues that seem to be what the film was going to focus on, but the whole thing went by too fast to be of any substance.This new Jumanji works on the pure star power it has as we watch The Rock, Kevin Hart and Jack Black interact with each other as they play the game. It's worth it for that and that alone",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
64,jtindahouse,The strong cast all deliver in an equally well written film,8,18 March 2018,"'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is a surprisingly well made and well executed film. I'll admit I had very little hope for it going in. I wasn't a big fan of the original and I'm not a big fan of Kevin Hart's brand of humour. I had almost no anticipation for the film whatsoever. It started out a little slowly (there's maybe a 15 minute period before the big stars actually come into the movie), but after that it kicked into gear and was a very fun two hour ride. The set up for the film is done perfectly. The lull at the start is completely necessary and makes every thing so much better later on. Knowing who these characters are before going into the game compared to what they become once they're in there is the best thing the film has going for it. Jack Black's character arc in particular is especially hilarious. In fact in what was an incredibly strong performance by the entire cast Black would have to be my stand out. Dwayne Johnson continues to be Hollywood's most improved comedian. Compare what he achieves now to his work early in his career and it's worlds apart. These days he's almost becoming a sure sign of quality. Kevin Hart was the surprise for me. I rarely enjoy his work, but here he was hilarious. Whoever wrote his one-liners did a fantastic job. They were almost always effective. The whole movie is just put together very well. The three lives per character structure was very clever and allowed so much freedom for the story to progress. Also I loved that there was no mucking around with the aspect of getting them into the game. They're in quickly and boom, the fun can begin. Too many films draw this process out in an attempt to be clever or create believability. I would happily recommend 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' to anyone looking for a good laugh and a fun time.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
65,DarkVulcan29,The Breakfast Club meets The Matrix,9,29 December 2017,"A delightful follow up to the 1995 film that starred the late great Robin Williams, comes the new film 22 years later, I really like the way it let's the audience know that it is a sequel and not a reboot. It 's joyfully adventure basic a send up of Indiana Jones and Lara Croft films. But the characters really stick together, that is what makes the film fun to watch. Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan , Kevin Hart and Jack Black play there parts very well, has teenagers who get pulled in a video game , and our in the bodies of the characters of the game. Jack Black steals most of the scenes has a teenage girl trapped in the body of a man. Villians here look like cast offs from a Mad Max film, but are still fun to watch. It's not totally a kids film, there are a few adult jokes put in. I really was entertained here, it's not a masterpiece but just a fun time, and sometimes that is all you need. So go in this expecting nothing more or less. I believe video game fans will find this a fun time.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
66,stevendbeard,Nice updated Sequel,8,21 December 2017,"I saw ""Jumanji:Welcome to the Jungle"", starring Dwayne Johnson-Central Intelligence, San Andreas; Kevin Hart-Central Intelligence, Krod Mandoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire_tv; Jack Black-Goosebumps, Tropic Thunder; Karen Gillan-The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, Doctor_tv and Bobby Cannavale-Ant_Man, The Other Guys.
This is a sequel to the 1995 Jumanji and takes place 20 years after the original. It starts with a flashback to 1995 and shows how the board game is transformed into a video game. Then, in the present, 4 teenagers discover the game and decide to play it-I guess they haven't seen the original movie. In the original movie, everything happened in the real world. Now, the players are sucked into the game as adult avatars, each with different skills and weaknesses. Dwayne was the nerd of the group-now he is not. Kevin was the jock-now he has a weakness to cake, yes, I said cake. Jack was a self absorbed teenaged girl-now she is in the body of a middle-aged man. And Karen, she was the shy girl-now she is a kick-ass Lara Croft type. When they land in Jumanji, they are told the rules of the game; they have to find a mystical jewel that the villain, Bobby, has taken and replace it to restore order. They have 3 lives each and there are different tests to pass-just like in a video game. There are several tributes to the original movie-animal stampedes, crocodiles in a flooded room, etc.-but thankfully, no Robin Williams hologram like they have tried in other movies. The song, 'Welcome to the Jungle' by Guns N Roses, is used as the end credits start. There isn't a scene at the very end but you do hear the drums that are heard throughout the movie, usually signaling something bad is about to happen. It has lots of humor and the actors are great in their roles.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for adventure action, suggestive content and some language and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
67,tadpole-596-918256,I remember when I was a kid way back in the 1900s . . .,6,3 January 2018,". . . there was first a children's book called JUMANJI, and then a family film titled the same. I do not believe that Japan's Sony Pictures was involved with either project. I vaguely recall the book was about a wholesome American board game, and the scariest thing about the original Made-in-the-USA flick involved kids on flying carpets in some sort of meteor shower. Before being subverted by Japanese propagandists, JUMANJI was not a wall-to-wall product placement vehicle for Asian motorcycles. It should go without saying that the original genuine American JUMANJI book and movie did NOT involve high school gals suddenly sprouting lizards, and then needing ten-minute lessons from the born-as-boys crowd on how to drain them. This insidious Sony Trojan Horse retains just enough of the trappings from the beloved U.S. original to sucker citizens into squandering their resources at theaters in our own Homeland in order to pervert our precious kiddies by filling their minds with smut and filth. Shame on Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for allowing this to happen!",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
68,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,9,20 July 2019,9/10 - funny sequel that doesn't quite live up to the spectacular original,Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
69,GiraffeDoor,It's fun.,7,30 November 2019,"Doubtlessly there are going to be killjoys who feel the first movie somehow morphs if any kind of derivative material is made from is and that this sequel has ""ruined"" a classic.Admittedly I had a few qualms about some universe mechanics but that's not really why I watch those movies.Not the poignant, emotional powerhouse of the first one, just a bit of fun with just enough character development surrounding the theme of being your best self. It's actually pretty darling how the jock, two nerds (I call them that with love) and a conventionally attractive social media addict realise by the end they have more in common with each other than they first realised.The whole thing looks stunning and the set pieces are everything you want. They combine, spectacle, humour and great suspense.I was a little thrown by the thing of different actors playing the main characters playing the characters while they are in the game but it didn't taint the picture. Jack Black made a very convincing teenage girl though they sadly milked this gag for a lot more than it was worth, especially when she tries to teach Ruby how to flirt.I have more mixed feelings about the way the whole thing is presented exactly like a video game and takes a lot of time to mock game play mechanics. I actually like that it's a videogame now. It's pretty frightening to think the game can evolve to make sure that people won't lose interest in it. I did get the impression that no one in the game is sentient but the main characters and this was a negative but I choose to try and interpret it the other way.Ultimately a good bit of fun viewing that ticks all the boxes for its genre.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
70,alindsay-al,A Great suprisingly fun comedy,8,28 May 2018,"This film had some real buzz about it but I have now finally seen Jumanji: Welcome to the jungle and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I actually enjoyed this film. The premise of the film sees four teenagers get sucked into the Jumanji video game they have to complete the game as their new avatars. Dwayne Johnson plays the lead in this film and he is really good, he is just really good in these comedic roles. I liked how his avatar character was different to his real world character and how they played that off in this movie to ensure this was a slightly different performance for The Rock. I have been a huge fan of Kevin Hart for years and even though he basically plays himself in every film role I really liked his character in the film. He is the hyper member of the team and I loved seeing his energy on screen, his character is just involved in so many funny moments. Karen Gillan is in this film and she does a good job, she plays the tough female character well and I felt like she worked well for this film. To me though the standout of this film had to be Jack Black, his avatar is of a teenage girl and I feel like he was the only person who could have played this role. He is Jack Black but acts like a girl so well you would feel like he does it every day of his life. Also credit should go to Joe Jonas who has a smaller role in the film but is one of the most interesting characters in the film. The same though cannot be said about Bobby Cannavale's villain who is just flat out generic and completely pointless. The story is pretty entertaining as you see this group of charming individuals go through this game in many creative environments and fun levels. However, I felt like when the film was in real life I didn't care about the characters or their situations which does hurt the overall quality of the film. . The script has some really funny humour in it, I haven't laughed that much in a while and I felt like the comedy was very natural. Also the use of dramatic dialogue works and adds to some heartfelt moments in the film. The style of the film is great for a fan of games as it has tons of references and stylistic choices relating to video games, the action scenes are decent as well too. Though I believe sometimes the CGI doesn't look particularly well and takes me out of some of the moments. Overall I thought this film was a huge surprise and if you like fun films, this could be a great time.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
71,Fluke_Skywalker,Perfectly acceptable time-waster,6,21 February 2018,"Plot; Four kids serving detention after school find an old video game system that pulls them in and makes them players in the game. Of the top-10 grossing (domestic) films released in '17, five were super hero/comic book based and one was a Star Wars film. Debuting strong and having exceptional stamina at the box office (currently sitting @ #5 and likely to pass Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 for the #4 slot within the next week), this (kinda) sequel to 1995's Jumanji clearly scratched an itch for moviegoers looking for a different kind of popcorn adventure. It's not that it's original in any meaningful way, but it's fresh by virtue of the characters not wearing capes or wielding lightsabers. Hitting its marks and checking off most of the requisite genre boxes, Juamnji: Welcome to the Jungle delivers a reasonably entertaining 2 hrs. thanks in no small part to its talented and game cast. If all that sounds like a backhanded compliment... .",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

73,jimbo-53-186511,Strong character chemistry plays a big part in making this work,7,29 December 2019,"When 4 teenagers are summoned to do detention, 1 of the teenagers comes across an old computer console whilst rooting around in the room. Out of curiosity, the teenagers fire it up and each pick a character to play as on the game. Unbeknownst to them, once they select their characters they end up sucked into the game and become the very avatars they've chosen. The stakes are high for the teenagers when they find that they can only be freed from the game by returning a jewel back to the Jaguar to release a curse that has been put on Jumanji.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle has a very 'Breakfast Club' type opening to proceedings with the characters ending up in detention and playing similar clichéd characters to what we saw in that film over 30 years ago. However, the screenwriters have carefully crafted the characters in this manner as a mere set-up for them arriving in the game as the adult avatars that they've chosen.In effect, what this does is allows the teenagers to retain their original personalities, but in the bodies of completely different people. It perhaps doesn't sound that amusing if you look at it written down, but when you see the results on screen then you'll understand what I'm getting at. In fact, the character chemistry is really where the film is at its best; Spencer and Fridge have their roles slightly reversed in the game which sets up some fun interplay between Johnson and Hart (particularly when Fridge forgets that he is no longer bigger and tougher than Spencer). Black perhaps has the most fun camping it up as a teenage girl trapped inside a middle-aged man's body - I have to admit part of me found it a little creepy, but a lot of me found it very funny (particularly when Bethany is trying to get used to her new 'body'). Gillan doesn't quite have as much fun as the others as she is mostly forced to play it straight - although her flirting scene is good and she looks terrific in those little shorts!!!). Jonas is perhaps the slight weak link here as he never seems to quite gel with the rest of the cast. I don't rate him as much of an actor, but he was OK in this one.I've talked a lot about the characters and they are a big selling point in this film; the original film had Robin Williams and it's fair to say that he completed dominated that picture. In this film, the 4 teenagers play as computer game characters and all bring different skill-sets to the table; this automatically makes the narrative more involving as you know that each character needs the other which sets up a strong dynamic. In the original film I always felt that Williams carried the film whereas in this remake the 4 actors all bring it to life making it feel like a nice collective effort.If I was to be critical of the film then I did feel that the story was only so-so and I thought the villain was poor as were his band of goons.In summary then this was a fun adventure which mostly works due to the strong chemistry and camaraderie between the 4 leads. Having them play as computer game characters rather than just been sucked into the game as themselves adds another dimension to the film and makes them interesting. If you're in one of those 'switch off brain and enjoy moods' then just sit back and relax as there's a lot of joy to be found in this film.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

I did enjoy the enemies though, especially the bikers.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
75,kirbylee70-599-526179,REBOOT THE GAME,10,29 March 2018,"Back in 1995 a movie came out that featured a board game as its centerpiece. Starring Robin Williams the movie told the story of a boy with a secret that is sucked into the world of the game only to be released years later when two more children began playing the same board game. When word came out that the movie, treasured by fans around the world, was being remade those fans were not quite sure what to expect. Rest easy because JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is just as wild, just as adventurous and just as much fun as the original.But no one plays board games these days right? The movie opens in 1996 and that's the case when a young teen named Alex tosses the board game aside to play his video games. The next day he looks at the case again to see it is now a video game, begins playing and disappears from this world.Fast forward to the present and a group of 4 teens are sent to detention. Spencer, the class nerd, and Fridge, the star ball player, are in trouble for Spencer doing Fridge's homework. Bethany is a self-absorbed young girl who lives on her cell phone, so much she had it on during a test. And Martha is a self-styled outcast sent here because she argued with a teacher. All are there for Saturday detention and instructed to clean out a storage room. But they find the old Jumanji game, hook it up to the TV and begin playing only to be sucked into the game just like Alex years ago.When they arrive in the jungle it takes them a while to realize what is going on. Spencer is now a muscle bound adventurer and played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Fridge is his sidekick and responsible for carrying a backpack with his weapons and played by Kevin Hart. Martha has turned into a fighting machine ala Laura Croft and played by Karen Gillian. And Bethany is now a knowledgeable professor played by Jack Black. Once they acclimate themselves to their predicament a transport arrives to pick them up.Driving the vehicle is Nigel, in reality a part of the game who is there to pass along information to the group and set them on their way. He tells them the story of an evil adventurer and Spencer's rival Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) who stole a famed jewel from the eye of a jaguar statue plunging Jumanji into darkness. Their task is to retrieve the jewel and take it back to be replaced in the statue. But there are several tasks involved along the way just like any game requires.Each learns about their strengths and weaknesses before they set out. They also find out the hard way what the stripes that seem to be tattooed on their arms mean. Each one is a life they have while playing the game. Lose a life, lose a stripe. And when they're all gone, its game over for that person.The thing that makes this film work is the interplay between the actors on screen as well as the alterations in their characters from the real world to the world of Jumanji. Spencer's 180 change has him looking at his arms and amazed at how big they are. Martha can't figure out why she's wearing such skimpy clothes in the jungle. Fridge can't believe he's little more than a sidekick. And Bethany bemoans her frumpy appearance and the loss of her much loved cell phone. But they all adapt while teasing one another about their changes.The acting from all four is wonderful to watch. For me Jack Black has always been hit or miss and he hits in this role, especially when he has to go to the bathroom. Gillian gets a chance to shine after her makeup laden role in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. Hart and Johnson, so amazing together in CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE, are just as good here. Johnson in particular shines in his comedic moments, especially when he gives a smoldering look.The effects are solid here and almost all CGI. But they're done well enough that it doesn't matter unlike some films that rely on those effects while doing them poorly. They play well into the story here and that story is solid enough to make you realize this isn't a remake so much as a reboot of the original.I found myself laughing throughout the film as well as cheering on the team making their way through the game. While there are a few jokes that adults will enjoy more than kids, they're not the sort that will be offensive and have you trying to explain them to the young ones. All in all I had a blast with this one and odds are I'll watch it again. My guess is you will as well.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

78,davispittman,One of the best action films I've seen in a while,9,31 December 2017,"I'll start out by saying that my family is a really big fan of the Robin Williams/Bonnie Hunt Jumanji movie, I personally thought it was alright. Nothing great, but not bad either. I went into this movie with my doubts about it's quality. One, because I wasn't the biggest fan of the original, and two because I was fearful it would just be another generic action romp. I was WRONG. This is one of the best action films I've seen in some time, and there are many reasons as to why this one works so well. Reason number one: the casting. This cast is just perfectly put together. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson really was great in the lead role, one of his best performances in my opinion. Kevin Hart serves as the ever hilarious comedic relief, and he did a fabulous job of making the audience laugh their asses off. Jack Black is really great here as well, very funny, really the best middle aged man in Hollywood you could pick to play as a teenage girl stuck in another body. And lastly, Karen Gillan and Nick Jonas give fun entertaining performances. The acting is a big plus for this movie. Reason number two: the writing. The script allows for many things: comedy, action, and some serious stuff too. Funny lines for the comedic heavyweights and more touching/sweet content for when it's called for. And finally, reason number three: very exciting action and effects. The action scenes are done well and achieve the level of excitement that they are going for. And the visual effects are top of the line as well. Overall, this is just a great film overall, and it even gave a small harken back to the original 90s film. Great lovable characters, exciting action, skilled writing... just a joy overall. 9/10 for Jumanji: Welcome to the jungle.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Whereas the original used the actual home of the players to stage the gameplay run amok, this version shoots the action in Hawaii, I believe, for God knows what reason & still have critters of the CG kind terrorize our players as if that makes any kind of difference.

He made King Kong (2005) bearable, and was perfect in Tropic Thunder, and I liked the semi-serious turn in The Holiday. Here like in most of his films, he helps with the comic turns but in an usual way that almost makes this his movie. Kevin Hart plays Kevin Hart. The Rock likewise plays the Rock. In this turn the game is amped up to being a video game but you know the drill. It's a pretty much mindless romp that I would have waited to see on HBO or Netflix but that a friend had passes. I guess I am tired of CGI and loud booms and plotless films. I suspect if you are under thirty you will enjoy this and have some laughs but the studios are really pushing Jumanji to the breaking point but I'm sure they will squeeze another film out of this franchise depending on the profits. I am beginning to wish Hollywood would start on the road to bankruptcy already with the endless repetitions.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
83,peterp-450-298716,Now this was a surprise. It's a fun flick to watch.,7,3 April 2018,"""I think we got, like, sucked into the game.
And we've become the avatars that we chose.""I was sure about one thing. A remake of ""Jumanji"" is the same as repainting the Mona Lisa and exhibiting this copy. Ridiculous, inglorious and unnecessary. I was afraid this movie would be ridiculed and laughed with. And on top of that, they've asked Dwayne Johnson to join. Not exactly an actor you'll see in what they call the ""better"" films. I thought it would be something like ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" and that I would curse the makers afterwards, because they dared to copy a milestone with the late Robin Williams starring in it. For once, however, I have to admit that I was wrong. It's been a long time since I've amused myself so much while watching a movie.In the original movie, it was of course Robin Williams who took care of the humorous part. And also the inhabitants of the jungle (with some bad looking computer graphics) who stirred things up in town, were kind of fun. In this movie nobody really stands out. They are all hilarious. And this because of the fact that the four main characters (who are being sucked into the game) are totally the opposite of the in-game character they've chosen.During a detention these four totally different students discover this dust-covered Jumanji game. This well-known game has been tranformed into an oldskool console game (well, they had to keep up with the times). Spencer (Alex Wolff) is a spindly little boy, plagued by all kinds of allergies, who looks rather clumsy and timid. Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) is an immense athlete. Bethany (Madison Iseman) is such a typical blond teengirl who thinks she's the centre of the universe instead of the sun. Martha (Morgan Turner) is the shy type. Again the same stereotypes you'll see in a film about an American high-school.It becomes really funny after they have been transformed into the characters from the computer game. Maybe too predictable but still hilarious at times. The schmuck suddenly sees how his biceps have grown. The stuck-up, smartphone-addicted instagram bimbo notices to her horror that her perfectly streamlined teenage body is trapped in a chubby, male body. The timid girl is suddenly a duplicate of Lara Croft and to her surprise she has knowledge of certain combat techniques. The well-built sports fanatic gets a rather submissive role as a dwarfish male with a backpack.Now get ready for the big surprise. The most hilarious role is played by Dwayne Johnson. That was really the last thing I expected. And of course Jack Black provides some humorous moments. Although the male genitalia are the main subject here. And the part where Karen Gillian has to learn the art of seduction, I actually was laughing my head off. And finally, a small remark. The pilot in the game (who's the long-lost teenager) looks a lot like footballstar Eden Hazard!But not only the interplay and the witty interactions convinced me. I also thought that the cleverly put together concept of a video game, was a brilliant idea. The NPC's that showed up here and there, the cut scenes and the way the participants return to the game (after which the tattoo on their arm suddenly changes) are all elements you can experience in a game. In other words, this film scores extremely high in terms of originality. On the one hand, the film ""Jumanji : Welcome to the jungle"" is an extension of the original film. But on the other hand it's also a stand-alone film (with only one reference to the original flick). So I have to admit that I am pleasantly surprised by this film. And even with Dwayne Johnson in the lead. There are no more certainties in this life !",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
84,Enchorde,Rumble in the Jungle,7,27 December 2018,"After some twenty years (and some technological development) Jumanji is back for a sequel. However, except some distant drums heard in the distance from time to time, not much (except the name) connects it with the original.In this movie, Jumanji has turned from a board game to a video game. And nothing spawns from the game like in the original, instead the characters are sucked into the game.In this the movie lost some of it's soul from the first installment. There are no dreaded rolls to be made, no rhymes to interpret what has been unleashed both upon the characters and the community around them. Instead the characters are drawn into the game, into the jungle where they are the ones that stand out, but with wild (all dangerous and man-eating) animals and gangsters that hunt them. Jumani is now a region, undre threat from a curse, that the team must save. So, it is not at all like the original, but it got some new good things added.The real world has changed, and so the story with it. In a video/computer game crazy world, the movie throws some good puns at it and current stereotypes. The movie is much more of an action comedy, with the empasis on comedy. The suspense is toned down and there are no real surprises. But it is fun to watch. But you need to let it stand on it's own legs, the connection with old Jumanji is thin. Do that, and it will probably entertain you...",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
85,questl-18592,Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7,22 September 2019,"Jumanji is just fun. Nothing more, nothing less. If you're able to just live in that world and not pick and poke at things, it's a great time. Fun action, great acting and laugh out loud funny at times even on a second watch.But, it doesn't take a ton of time to flesh out the universe and, much like the characters, we're simply thrown into the middle of it. This makes it pretty easy to find problems but it's still fun.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
86,adamjohns-42575,A Future Classic,8,13 May 2021,"When I first saw this film I was convinced that I would hate it. I mean, firstly, who the hell did they think they were taking a well loved classic and giving it a reboot anyway? And into a Video Game no less? And then . . . And then they populated it with actors that 9 times out of ten I am really not a fan of (Not Karen Gillan, she's great!). These are people who play caricatures of themselves all the time. But do you know what? That worked perfectly. I can't think of any other actors that could have taken on these roles and made them their own like Dwayne, Jack, Kevin and Karen did, taking the pi$$ out of their own ego's and ""flaws"" throughout.In some ways this edition of Jumanji is superior to the first. It has far better CGI and it actually takes you in to the game instead of the game coming out to you, but it would obviously be nowhere without Mr Williams and that team leading the way.I really like the Video Game references that even an old fart like me can recognise and it is incredibly fun. Just as easy to watch as the original and I'm sure it will last the course just as well.It's a look so really strange that 'Baby I Love Your Way' by 'Big Mountain' fits in to this film in such a great and fun way.There's action, there's comedy, a bit of romance and a general feel good vibe.I am a bit concerned that they rushed into a further sequel so quickly and I am prepared to be disappointed when I get to see it, but I would also love to be surprised as I was by this one.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
87,truemythmedia,More Fun Than It Has Any Right To Be,6,9 May 2019,"Upon seeing the trailer for this film, my initial reaction was ""Oh, God, why?"" I honestly probably wouldn't have seen this film (certainly not in theatres) had it not been for a family trip to the movies Christmas day. However, I must say I was pleasantly surprised.
Let me say that this is not a good movie, but neither is it a bad movie. It is ever so slightly above average as far as I am concerned. The plot is essentially ""Breakfast Club"" meets ""Ready Player One"" meets ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"". Four mismatched kids are sent to detention, where they discover a videogame that sucks them into the Amazonian world of Jumanji. They must work together, braving the dangers of the jungle, to return an ostrich-egg-sized jewel with magical properties to the eye socket of a massive Jaguar idol before the villain, Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale, ""Ant-Man""), wraps his evil talons round it.
Jumanji is fast paced, light-hearted, humorous, and, above all, just a ton of fun. It is not anything that will win awards; it didn't break any new ground, it (probably) won't be remembered as a classic in fifteen years, but if you're looking for something fun, this movie might just put a smile on your face. Don't go in expecting to be blown away, but with managed expectations, this film is utterly enjoyable.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
88,ShelbyTMItchell,Not as Good as the Original but Still Fun!,7,30 December 2017,"The late Robin Williams would had been proud. And really it lives up to the 1995 original.As four teens, football player Fridge, geeky Spencer and Martha, and self absorbed beauty Bethany are in detention for different reasons.

I watched the original film sometime last year because I wanted to compare the two. And it is almost as funny and entertaining, I almost scored THIS film higher than the original, almost that is if it wasn't for the second half of the film taking a bit of a dive thanks to recycled jokes and whatever.

93,rgkarim,Welcome To The Jungle,7,21 December 2017,"The drums beat heavy in the air, the impending sound of doom resonating with their deep sounds indicating another threat on the horizon. Those tribal instruments were just one component of the adventure Jumanji was back in the 90s, well that and about a thousand other things that made for a fun adventure. Now, decades later, the jungle is to be unleashed once more to the modern generation in hopes of reviving the adventure once more, perhaps for more sequels. Robbie K here to give you the 411 on the latest movies, so let's get started!LIKES: The References: It's always fun to get pleasant memories of your childhood refreshed with a nostalgic reference. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, tips its hat towards a couple of Easter eggs that will take you back to the nineties. The animatronic animals, the familiar sounds of wild life hidden in the bushes, and a few shout outs to previous characters were well placed to revive the spark the prequel made long ago. Acting: Okay, this film isn't going to win any major awards for best actor/actress, but that doesn't count it out for quality, entertaining talent. Dwayne Johnson is still a rugged, stud adventure type with a smolder and skill for comedic sarcasm. Kevin Hart has the rant style down, focusing on energetic, loud delivery with a little cursing to sweeten the pot. Jack Black provides the awkward comedy, yet manages to take it one step further by acting like a girl trapped in a man's body, including all the mannerisms that modern teenage girls exemplify. Karen Gillan is edgy, angst filled, yet somehow reserved to bring a fighter not fueled by raging hormones of stress. While it doesn't sound that different, there are a couple of things that impressed me. The first is that the chemistry between these actors, which seemed very natural as they bounced their insults and dialogue off of one another. The second component is how the actors seemed to portray not only the qualities of their avatar, but also of the kids trapped inside them. Much like Jack Black, the actors all had to balance teenage adolescent with epic adventure role and it worked very well for me. Comedy: By far the strongest component for me though is the laugh fest hidden in the foliage of the artificial jungle world. Jumanji 2 was one of the funniest adventures I've seen in a while, filled with a plethora of comedic styles to tickle your fancy in a variety of ways. Insult humor, one-liners, meme worthy antics, and even sexual innuendos are all crammed into the 2-hour run time. Spreading the humor throughout kept things fresh for me and changing up the style only further kept me laughing. However, the component I loved was how tasteful the stupidity was, managing to combine wit and slapstick into a blend that is just a hoot to watch. I feel this style will work for a wide variety of ages, though beware of the occasional curse bomb to light up the screen. 
DISLIKES; A Little Corny/Stretch: Welcome to the Jungle is a stretch in many regards, however there are times where the movie treks of the already ridiculous path. Some of the action scenes have stunts that defy physics, or performances that are pushing the limits at times. These inconsistencies are easy to ignore for the most part, and really don't ruin much with all the fun to be had. Yet, these components are a little cheesy at times, fake looking even more so, and dilutes the message in a preachy fashion. The Bad Guy: The main villain has a cool power to use, but sadly the villain doesn't utilize it very well. In addition, the primary antagonist and his cronies are a little anticlimactic in terms of threatening the jungle, being more roar than bite. A few lousy maneuvers, a threat here or there, and some lame NPC minions just didn't do it for me in regards to development and design. Missing Adventure: As fun as the video game twist was on the movie, I missed the component of the board game that made the original the adventure it was. Remember the terror of the unknown as the dice rolled and the swirling green mist formed into a message? How about seeing the horrors of the jungle out into the real world and our heroes having to do everything to keep the board safe? Yeah, those thrills are what Jumanji was about as the beasts were unleashed in special effect glory. This movie focused a little too heavy on the biker gang motive and sort of ditched the jungle component for me. I missed the animal part of this adventure and the blending of these threats together, and the adventure they crafted. The VERDICT:  Welcome to the Jungle is a very fun movie and I was not disappointed as I could have been. It's funny, with a great cast to bring the crew to life and a great energy to keep one entertained throughout the whole movie. Yet, the comedy seemed to be the main focus, because the balanced laughs really overshadowed the adventure component the first movie had within it. Still, many ages will enjoy what this movie has to offer and will be quoting this movie for quite some time after it leaves theaters. Worth a trip to the theater? Absolutely, though save your dough and don't see it in 3-D. My Scores:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.0",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
94,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An equal followup to that of the original,7,8 November 2019,"The original Jumanji (1995) back in the mid 1990s was a phenomenon in itself. It may have not smashed records like that of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) or Jurassic Park (1993), but it was also no underground film that went totally under the radar. Many fans remember it fondly for not only having likable characters and an interesting story, but also because of the lasting impression it left. While Jumanji was marketed as a family film, it definitely had some rather intense moments. When a sequel was announced to this film, somehow the reaction wasn't as largely lambasted. Probably majority of people were curious as to how such a feat could be pulled off. To everyone's surprise, things went better than expected, especially with respect to other game to movie adaptations.Directed by Jake Kasdan (Bad Teacher (2011) and Sex Tape (2014)) and writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers (The Lego Batman Movie (2017)), Scott Rosenberg (Gone in 60 Seconds (2000)) and Jeff Pinkner (The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)) all penning the script put together a sequel that remarkably matches up the original. Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany (Madison Iseman) and Martha (Morgan Turner) are all everyday high school students. Spencer's a nerd, Fridge is an athlete, Bethany is the popular girl and Martha is not. After they all receive detention for disobeying their teachers, they discover the Jumanji game in the form of a video game in the room they sit. It is there they discover there's more to the game than just something to use their time. Once inside the game, is when things get uniquely comical.Spencer becomes the macho Dr. ""Smolder"" Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Fridge turns into Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart), Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan) and Bethany, to her shock is now Professor Sheldon ""Shelly"" Oberon (Jack Black). And what makes the plot to this sequel a worthy follow-up is because of how it changes the scenario for everyone involved. Unlike the original where the game turned its surrounding environment into the jungle, here the people playing the game get transported into the game (which is a jungle). On top of that, the four main stars are also not turning in performances they usually fit the mold too. Johnson, Black, Gillan and Hart all have to play the younger actors' personalities and not their own. While some mannerisms are kept the same, seeing the veteran actors act like teenagers is very different.This leads to some very comedic scenes revolving around their situation. It's all opposites as to how they looked in real life. However aside from the physical aspect, the characters also have other moments to develop and learn to work as a team. There's also appearances from Nick Jonas and Bobby Cannavale who plays Van Pelt (the villain from the original movie). Most of the time replacing an already existing character would constitute as bad continuity, but here there's a justifiable reason as to why Van Pelt is being played by another actor, so it's okay. However one thing that does need to be addressed, is more use of the lesser known stars. Yes, having Jack Black, Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan and Kevin Hart star does help, but it would be nice to see more attention given to the younger actors. There's also the whole thing about how the story continues after this....it is rather definitive.As for visuals, the cinematography was handled by Gyula Pados. For what's shown, it looks great. The backgrounds are lush green and the inside scope of Jumanji looks vast and wide. Pados seems to know how to handle this based on the fact that he also shot for other big landscape films like Predators (2010) and Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials (2015). Lastly, the film score composed by Henry Jackman was well done too. Jackman has lent his talents to all genres like Monsters Vs. Aliens (2009), Kick-Ass (2010) and Winnie the Pooh (2011), so it shows that he can handle not only more tender moments but also lively action sequences too. While he doesn't reprise the creepy theme of James Horner's score, he does create a new one that fits the tone and it is repeated throughout.While the younger actors don't get as much time to shine, nor does this sequel really leave it open to more stories, this sequel is definitely on point with its predecessor. The action/comedy mix well, the scenario has the main leads challenge their performance skills, the cinematography is lit fantastically and the music is a welcome addition to franchise.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
95,justin-fencsak,"48 minutes in, and I'm hooked!!!",7,8 March 2018,"When Jumanji leapt from book to screen in 1995, it became a hit loved by kids and their families like me who saw it at the Loews in Wayne. Robin Williams, fresh off hits like Aladdin and Mrs Doubtfire, delivered a performance for the ages. An animated tv series soon followed. Then Robin Williams passed away. Soon, it was time to reboot Jumanji for a new generation hooked on 3d games. Thus, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was born. The character that Williams played, Alan Parrish, is honored in an homage during the beginning of the movie. The main cast is excellent, with Karen Gillan, hot off Doctor Who and Guardians of the Galaxy, as well as Kevin Hart and Jack Black along with Dwayne Johnson, a.k.a. The Rock, in his biggest hit of his career since the last Fast and Furious movie. The special effects are just as good as the original movie, and there's tons of pop culture and video game references in this film that is still playing in theaters while making its digital HD debut this week with a physical release in two weeks. You don't have to watch the original Jumanji in order to appreciate this film. Game on!!!",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
96,Kingslaay,Enjoyable,7,14 January 2018,Jumanji was a entertaining flick. It serves the purpose of the cinema sometimes when one wants to sit back and enjoy some easy to understand film.

97,eric262003,Easy Fun For Everyone,7,30 November 2019,"It's been over two decades that Robin Williams graced the screen in the original 1995 film ""Jumanji"". Cut to 22 years later, ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" was released, and regardless if you refer to it as a reboot or a sequel, make no denial about it, this movie stands alone from the original version. In the opening scenes we have an homage to the 1985 John Hughes directed film ""The Breakfast Club"" scenario where four teenagers, the introverted brain Spencer Gilpin (Alex Wolff), the jock Anthony ""The Fridge"" Johnson (Ser'Darius Blain), the popular girl Bethany Walker (Madison Iseman) and the insecure Martha Kaply (Morgan Turner) all take part in video game they discovered while serving penalization after school. (the video game was once a board game in the original ""Jumanji"").However, once they proceed to play, they literally become the avatars that they have chosen for themselves. Spencer has now become Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), an archaeologist with muscles, Fridge has become zoologist Franklin Finbar (Kevin Hart), Martha has become Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan) a sexy but lethal warrior, and playing for comical laughter, Bethany has become Dr. Shelly Oberon (Jack Black), a frumpy, middle-aged explorer.While completely puzzled by their new transformations, they soon realize that to return to civilization, they have to play the game, complete they game, or they will likely be stuck in the game or possibly be killed.Written also under the direction of Jake Kasdan, and written by Chris McKenna, Jeff Pinkner, Erik Summers and Scott Rosenberg, this movie may be upgraded from the previous installment and animated series in the 1990's, this movie delivers nothing original in terms of new twists and is just a recycled rehash of the series and other adventure themed movies. And sure this reboot might be more family friendly and predictable from the its predecessor, Kasdan had accomplished into making this more enjoyable and fun to watch.Like a video game character he/she/they have to endure on newer, more complicated challenges to advance levels and in this movie, each stage in their mission is so exciting, even the audience can get involved due to the production quality that's tantalizing and energetic.Many fans that watched the original installment, were doubting this newer version after it was announced in 2015 that a newer version would be released. They all assumed that Sony Pictures was just making this film just to cash in on a successful movie, or to upstage the movie as a tribute to the legendary Robin Williams who died last year. If it wasn't for Williams, this continuation would've never been made.But Kasdan did make the rightful choice in making Johnson the leading character who over the years has established himself as a top action star who can offer light comedic touches to his scenes. As Smolder he possesses wits, muscles and leadership in this game for survival. The other thing that Johnson possesses is the wonderful chemistry he has among his costars. Reprising the love-hate friendship he had with Kevin Hart from ""Central Intelligence"" they seem natural when they have altercations with each other. Jack Black provides the most comedic moments here and makes every moment a special one.But the most valuable character goes to Karen Gillan who even though she is the token woman hero in the flick, her scenes focus on her fighting style and takes her character role very seriously as a prominent character. Nick Jonas also has a supporting role as the missing child Alex Verbeek who's avatar's name is Seaplane McDonaugh who speaks in pop culture terms like he 's still living in 1996.The main weakness in ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is the villain named Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) who lacks in adding dimension to his antagonistic ways. In addition to that his role is just padded on to go with the flow of the movie because a movie of this calibre needs a villain. I wanted him to be better represented.And sure it's lighter and more CGI dependent than it's 1995 cohort, ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" provides the essential entertainment to keep its viewers in contempt. And though the characters depicted in the film are distant to each other at first, after the movie's over they start to bond with each other. It's mostly due to the wonderful charisma of the cast that makes it all possible.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

99,vengeance20,"Awesome, just awesome!",9,23 December 2017,"Heard about another Jumanji Film being made, but thought it was going to be a remake of sorts. Well, through years of development it seems to be more of a different take on the 1995 classic! And a good take it was!Starting at 1996, a young man finds a ""board game"" on the beach after hearing the iconic ""jungle drums"" sound emitting from the box partially covered in sand. Like the original, he finds it, takes it home with him, & then finds out it's an Nintendo like game & plugs it into his console & starts playing, he gets sucked in & is trapped in the game, similar to the original, but as a computer games console, not a board game, interesting take.So fast forward 21 years later, & 4 young teens who all come together via detention play the game & get sucked in after finding it in a store room in the school. It's then they find themselves in different bodies & each have 3 lives like that of a computer console game. They then learn of the curse of the jungle via a green jewel & must place it back where it was & shout ""Jumanji!"".The film I thought was pretty good! Of course it wouldn't be nearly as good as it's counter back in '95, but it's pretty damn close to be an original & somewhat is! The story was simple & easy to follow, the characters were great & likable, Karen Gillan was a babe in this film! (sorry had to say it!), but she & the others were great! I also liked the humour in this film too! It was funny & fitted well!I was kind of peeved it wasn't set in the real world as appose to a jungle, but I suppose it was because they were sucked into a different world so it made sense in a way, & it wasn't too bad either!Overall this film was a good watch & matches pretty well with the original film! 9/10 Go watch it!",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

102,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle""- Who'd have thought such an unnecessary and belated sequel could not only be good... but also be better than the original?",9,29 March 2018,"In the months leading up to the release of 2017's ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"", pretty much all you could hear was moans and groans from the collective film-going audience. People were upset that the beloved 1995 Robin Williams classic was getting a sequel. Purists were infuriated that the movie was updating the treacherous game for modern times. Online commentators couldn't get over co-star Karen Gillan's laughably skimpy outfit and took pot-shots at the movie over it. This is one of those films that just couldn't catch a break.Yet, something happened. Early reviews weren't just solid- they were absolutely glowing. A slew of sneak-preview screenings garnered extremely positive feedback from audiences. And when the film was finally released, it earned a near-unanimous acclaim. For a film that just couldn't catch a break, ""Welcome to the Jungle"" became a welcome and fantastic example of that old saying ""never judge a book by its cover."" Everyone was so wrapped up in pre-release drama and accusations... we just never considered that it might have not only been good- it might have actually been better than the original.Twenty years after the original adventure, a group of modern-day high school students all find themselves stuck in detention for varying reasons. Neurotic geek Spencer (Alex Wolff), meat-headed football star Anthony (Ser'Darius Blain), awkward loner Martha (Morgan Turner) and self-obsessed popular-girl Bethany (Madison Iseman). While sorting old magazines for recycling, the group discovers a mysterious video-game entitled ""Jumanji"" and boot it up, only to find themselves magically pulled inside of the game. Now occupying the bodies of the characters they chose (Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black), the troubled teenagers must complete the game's objective and solve increasingly difficult ""levels"" in order to escape. Along the way, they find a new ally in Alex (Nick Jonas), a long-lost kid who has been stuck in the game since 1996, all while being tracked by the game's villainous baddie Russell Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), whom has attained control over Jumanji's animal kingdom.The greatest treats of ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" are the playful and creative tone the story takes, and the excellent cast who have a grand time hamming it up for the camera. Co-written by Chris McKenna of ""Community"" fame, the script is an absolute blast and a half that both pays tribute to the original film while also taking the story in interesting new directions. The idea of Jumanji transforming itself into a video-game to attract modern teenagers is actually really clever, and it keeps the sequel fresh and unique while still remaining true to the original. There's also a ton of really fun meta-humor that fans of modern games will absolutely adore. I really got a kick over how the secondary characters can only speak a few specific lines over and over, in a playful nod to how video-game NPC's usually only have a handful of programmed responses. And the uproariously funny fact that Gillan's aforementioned skimpy outfit is a satirical swipe at how games often objectify female characters. (Like I said... never judge a book by its cover...)This is aided quite well by director Jake Kasdan's keen eye for visuals and sharp sense of pacing. The film's action set-pieces are genuinely thrilling, the humor is well-delivered and there's almost never a dull moment to be had. Kasdan has honed his skills throughout the years with some delightful projects, including the woefully underrated ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"", and here, that experience pays off in spades. And I can't wait to see what he does next.But perhaps the films greatest achievement is the absolutely outstanding cast. Particularly Johnson, Hart, Gillan and Black, who get to play against type and seem to relish in this in each and every moment. Everyone knows Johnson is one kick-butt dude... so it's a lot of fun seeing him playing the role of a neurotic teen whose allergic to just about everything. Gillan often plays sexy side-kicks or treacherous characters, which makes for a good contrast when she's playing an uncomfortable weirdo who can't talk to guys and doesn't like to be noticed. Hart's an absolute hoot playing a giant linebacker stuck in a diminutive body. And Jack Black... my god, Jack Black is outstanding as a popular teen girl stuck in a middle-aged man's body. He gets the biggest laughs of the film, and wisely never plays the part too broad. He's just perfect, perfect, perfect.It's a genuine surprise just how much fun this film is. I know as a 90's kid myself, I had my standards set high and thought nothing could come close to the original. And I was very pleasantly shocked when I walked out of the theater and realized that in many ways, ""Welcome to the Jungle"" is better than the original. It's sharp. Exciting. Hilarious. It really is the perfect continuation. Sure I could nit-pick the fact that the villainous Van Pelt is a bit under-developed. And I could argue that a few of the effects don't quite work. But on the whole... yeah. If you loved the original, I can't imagine you wouldn't love this stellar sequel just as much if not more.I'm giving ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" an excellent 9 out of 10 for its sheer, infectious fun-factor.

103,mike48128,Imagnative and Fun for the Family!,9,29 August 2018,"In 1995, the board game ""Jumanji"" resurfaces in the USA once again. Never mind that originally it washed up from the ocean in France at the end of the first movie. It ""morphs"" into a Play Station-like self-contained video game and a teen-aged boy is sucked into it and becomes a helicopter pilot. Twenty-one years later, 4 teens get sucked into it again. This time, it is a jungle-themed adventure game with a rather-thin ""plot"" which follows silly video game protocols. Each player has 3 lives and special strengths and weaknesses, which they can view and sometimes control. Many twists and turns. The 4 ""gamers"" are transformed into new avatars. Two of them are almost ""invulnerable"". One is a Tarzan-like ""Indiana Jones"" and a gorgeous babe combining the charms of ""Laura Croft"" and Marvel's ""Black Widow "". Both can perform impossible leaps and bounds, like superheroes. A nerdy girl turns into a boy nerd (Jack Black). All are chased (and some are killed) by dangerous jaguars, ""man-eating"" hippos and rhinos. One gets blown up by explosive food, jumping to their death, etc. All are restored by their extra lives. Much ""tame"" mostly non-graphic video game violence, no cuss words, and the ""feeling"" that everything will turn out fine in the end. They are helped along-the-way by various ""guides"" and the magical powers of a luminous green gem that creates evil and yet returns everything back to normal when it is returned, similar to ""The Temple of Doom"" concept. Uttering the word ""Jumanji"" ends the game. The original player returns to his own timeline and so does everyone else. ""Jimanji 3"" is planned, and I don't really see a reason for it as the game is destroyed at the end of this movie. Perhaps magic or cursed things are ""immortal""? Look for ""Jumanji 3-The Search for More Money"" (my title) in 2 years.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

106,Abdulxoxo,Wildly entertaining,8,13 February 2021,"This movie reverses the whole concept of the original, instead of stuff coming out of the game, this time stuff goes into the game. We then find ourselves in Jumanji with the four teenagers who have now turned into their avatars. After getting over the initial shock of the situation, they realise that each of their characters have unique strengths and weaknesses and they must work together and use their abilities to complete the game in order to go home. The actual plot wasn't as terrible and sort of worked as a loose sequel to the original. The scenario plays out like a computer game which which was pretty cool and mostly well done. Like a computer game each character gets a certain number of lives. There were also details like non-player characters repeating certain phrases because they only have very specific roles to play in the game. I thought that side of the film was well written. However it's the performances that make this movie so good. In particular Jack Black, who almost steals the whole film. His impressions of a teenage girl in a middle-aged man's body were hilarious. We know he's a funny physical actor and he takes full advantage in this film to have fun with the scenario. Dwayne Johnson is also really good. His characters real life persona of Spencer is a geek who's afraid of everything. Yet that kid is now in Johnson's body with the strength and charisma of Bravestone, who literally smoulders. Kevin Hart is also hilarious. Karen Gillan doesn't exactly play against type, but she does become a badass character who is also very funny especially when trying to flirt.

108,Troy_Campbell,"Dumb, hilarious, messy and entertaining.",6,27 December 2017,"Technically a sequel, but realistically a soft reboot, Jumanji 2.0 takes the central concept of the original and transforms it into an action-adventure outing for its digitally-savvy audience. Board games are out and video games are in. It won't win any awards for screenwriting with it's predictable and plodding plot-high school stereotypes must save the titular game-world by returning a stolen jewel-however the team of scribes get one big tick; the introduction of a body swap conceit generates consistent laughs. In fact, the broad comedy is consistently (and surprisingly) excellent. There's a lot of low-hanging fruit, sure, but the combination of the cast's comedic timing and their willingness to poke fun at themselves is a winning formula that absolutely shines through. Dwayne Johnson is his usual likable self as jungle explorer Dr Smolder Bravestone, Karen Gillan is a crack-up as the awkward bad-ass Ruby Roundhouse, Kevin Hart gives good Kevin Hart as sidekick Mouse Finbar, and Jack Black unequivocally steals the show as an egotistical ""hot-girl"" stuck in the body of overweight, middle-aged man Professor Shelly Oberon. The set pieces are decent without ever really impressing, the raft of winks and nods to the 1995 version earning enough goodwill to let the lack of originality slide for two-thirds of the movie. The final act, however, becomes quite the slog to get through as the comedy is swept aside in favour of an action finale full of poor CGI, unmemorable sequences and an overacting Bobby Canavale as the sneering villain. A flawed action movie, but a good-quality laugh-at-loud comedy, Jumanji is the epitome of Boxing Day family flick: dumb but hilarious, messy but entertaining.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
109,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,A perfectly okay movie that's got lots of 'Rock'-n-roll to it.,7,11 April 2018,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle came out in late 2017 and surprised everyone who came across it: here's a film that's a REBOOT of a 90s-Robin-Williams-film that has Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson in it, and then this film went on to gross nearly a billion dollars worldwide. I was certainly surprised that Jumanji became such a hit despite all the factors working against it from the start. It managed to out-gross SpiderMan: Homecoming, Justice League and even Wonder Woman. How did it get so big? I think it's all to do with it being a retroactive video game film, that respects and loves video games without BEING a film based off one in the first place.How does Jumanji hold up against the stack of other family-friendly films that have come out during this decade? I reckon it's got some legs in terms of audience appeal and longstanding on home video. It certainly helps with the nostalgia factor people have for the original Jumanji.You want brisk family entertainment that's essentially a family-friendlier Indiana Jones movie but from Sony? Jumanji is that movie. Go ahead; it's good fun all on its own anyway.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

111,blumdeluxe,Watchable,5,9 February 2020,"""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" tells the story of four teenagers that are sucked into a computer game and have to work together in order to win back their former lives while at the same time adopting to the new roles they've been given in this world full of dangers and threats.It is in a way logical to transfer the classic Jumanji story into modern times by just turning the board into a video game. Apart from the fact that the whole concept of getting sucked into a game seems pretty uncreative to me in general, this is a thought that I understand. The way it is carried out is actually decent. You can watch the movie with less cringe than I've feared, some lines are nice or funny. However, I just don't get rid of the feeling that this is more a cash cow than it is the personal interest of someone to make a good film. The result is your typical Hollywood blockbuster that everyone can live with but no one will call particularly priceworthy or remarkable.All in all this is a decent movie for what it is supposed to be.

There was great action scenes, some humorous bits of dialogue and enough of a plot to keep things moving.This is obviously not very deep (which was exactly what I was after) fairly predictable and does play to stereotypes - but none of that matters.If you are after some easy family fun then is perfect!

119,one9eighty,An update of a classic family film which makes it relevant for the family of today - better than I expected.,7,28 August 2018,"Four kids from an American school are working off their detention doing tedious chores; they find a games console and decide to have some fun. Fun turns to magical mystery danger when they get sucked into the video game they were playing, and thrown into a jungle adventure wearing the avatars of the characters they selected. In order to escape the game they must complete it, which involves returning a mysterious green jewel back into a statue, thus freeing the jungle of evil tyranny. In this brand new Jumanji adventure, things are updated for a newer audience, but the set-up is similar to the original film with Robin Williams. Instead of the game escaping into reality, reality is sucked into the game. Instead of the outdated concept of a board game, modern audiences would be more familiar with a games console. I didn't expect a lot from this film, I was prepared for a big budget, low enjoyment re-hash of the 90's film but I have to admit, I was wrong. As a gaming fan myself I enjoyed the updated version of Jumanji and enjoyed the references to game set-up scenarios - particularly when obvious questions were asked - like ""Why?"". As in ""Why can't you just drive us to what you are talking about?"" or ""Why have you called us instead of the legal authority?"" The use of video games as a spine of the concept allowed for OTT realism to be used, super strength, super jumping, instant reincarnation from death, etc. This was used to good effect as a way of progressing the vehicle of the plot, and for comedic emphasis too. The plot may have been done before, but the delivery was sweet all the same. The cast were really good, one and all; they convincingly portrayed the traits they brought from reality as well as the traits the video game gave them. Modern films have a tendency to make humour sexy or gross out/lewd, this didn't, which was refreshing, it kept things aimed at family friendly - ok, it played on stereotypes based on the characters in the movie, but it managed to show a lot of character development. The people at the start of the film are different from what you see at the end of the film. The self-obsessed socialite it-girl was more nature and adventure loving by the end and didn't rely on her phone to run her life.Like the first film, there were subtle situations/events on-screen which younger audiences will not necessarily follow which offer a lot of depth to film savvy minds; such as multiverse's, fragmented realities, time travel, butterfly effects, inanimate objects with powers. One of the morality statements the film tried subtly to make, but failed, was the attire that Karen Gillan's character was wearing - one hand it was making a statement about the sexism of video games, but then in subsequent scenes she is seen using her body and her sexuality as a weapon - making the statement less effective.Packaged the way it is, there is something for all in this film. FTR, one of the things which I particularly enjoyed was the continuality between the first Jumanji in the 90's and this one. I watched them back to back and where one film finishes another picks up, and presumably, where this finishes, a future re-has could pick up. It was almost like a ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Hammer Horror"" concept in that the entity of Jumanji becomes timeless character in itself.I couldn't say that this was better or worse than the original, it's on par - but it's different. This, in my mind, makes the film a success and deserved of the same rating that I gave the first film. 7 out of 10.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
120,sergelamarche,Great production,7,19 December 2018,"Lots of great effects. The story is your typical jungle adventure with some troubles added. Funny to see grown ups talking like kids also.

121,educallejero,What a surprise!,8,17 September 2018,"The truth is that this movie is fun all through. All the actors are charismatic. The adventure in Jumanji's game is fast but not so fast that you can't play with what these people are going through. They land some good jokes too, and even if the majority aren't, they don't hurt the movie.""The Rock"" acted as a different kind of guy (a nerd with his body) and he did an excellent job. And because I usually don't like him much, that fact might've help me to enjoy his presence more. Everybody acts really well as sterotypes imprisoned on other stereotypes' bodies. Its good writing.The movie manages to give you tension (like a game when you start dying) without taking away any of the fun, which sounds easier than it is.The evolution of the characters' mindsets are a bit cliché, but earned.Last: This movie shows that Karen Gillan is a real actress and not just a skinny lady. She acts the hell of the role, she's funny and weird, while she's intense and funny as Nebula for the MCU. Sold!",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
122,phubbs,Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,3,6 April 2018,"Welcome to the jungle...really? Is that the best they could come up with? How many movies have used that in one way or another now?So at the end of the first movie (in 1969) the board game Jumanji was thrown into a river by Alan Parrish; 26 years later (1995) its somehow ended up in France apparently. Fast forward to 1996 and the board game has once again been discovered...but back in America? (I trust that wasn't supposed to be the same beach from the first movie). Anyway the game has somehow evolved with the times and is now a videogame console; and once again it lures another unsuspecting youth into its jungle themed clutches. Fast forward again to 2016 and four students will also discover the board game which will trigger the same things that happened before. And round and round we go.So I gotta admit that I liked the idea that this mysterious game can somehow evolve with the times. Back in the first movie (1969) it was a board game to blend in with the era. Now its a videogame console which of course is perfect for this era. The whole idea of the protagonists choosing a game avatar to play as which then turns out to be their live action avatar once inside the game is pretty cool (although 'Red Dwarf' did it first). This does inevitably lead to very stereotypical characters which is deliberate...but doesn't excuse the stereotypical teenage protagonists which wasn't deliberate I'm guessing.Yeah so the teenagers, they're a straight 'Breakfast Club' type bunch for sure. You've got the jock, the nerd, the princess, and the weirdo. So yeah its a complete rip-off. I really felt like they could of done better with these characters despite the movie being full of deliberate cliches and stereotypes. As for the avatars they are also rather cliche, naturally. The Rock is of course just playing the same character he always does, basically himself. Jack Black is the squat, spectacled, old fashioned looking professor type. Kevin Hart is the goofy sidekick type. And Karen Gillian is Lara Croft essentially.One thing that did get me thinking was the in-game characters, the baddies and the in-game guide. The in-game guide and various baddie henchmen all seemed to act like actual videogame characters on rails. In other words they don't interact with the protagonists on a personal level, they just do and say what they were programmed. But some henchmen and the main villain (Bobby Cannavale as Professor Van Pelt, same name as the big game hunter from the first movie) seemed to not do this. It did seem like Van Pelt behaved differently and not in a programmed way like the others, almost as if he were a real person. Now in the original movie we never saw the jungle in the game, obviously this time we do. Alas its not really been visualised that well in my opinion. I always had the impression the jungle was set in an old fashioned British colonial type era mixed with a bit of 'Tarzan' type fantasy. Like the exterior of the board game indicates. Of course as the game evolved so did the interior jungle it seems. This unfortunately has led to all sorts of modern crap turning up like military choppers, motorbikes, modern guns and weapons, ridiculous chase sequences, and lots of explosions. Now I'm sure some people will have liked these elements but for me it totally ruined the entire feel of the movie, or at least the look and feel I was hoping for.Gone is the possibility of quaintness and charm, enter vast CGI chase sequences on-board a military chopper (being chased by man eating CGI rhinos. Why didn't they just shoot them?). Stupid chase sequences with hordes of motorbike riding bad guys. Lots of gunfire, explosions and of course the obligatory martial arts sequences from Ruby Roundhouse. I might add that Ruby Roundhouse spends lots of time trying to learn how to flirt and act sexy to distract some bad guys, but ends up just kicking the crap out of them. Her entire character is utterly pointless, why did we need all that shit when she can just beat them up. Its like one sequence where The Rock's character says he knows CPR but doesn't actually do it when its required. He just stands there and gives instructions to another character, eh??Its really such a shame that this movie went down the route it did. Obviously there was gonna be CGI involved, obviously there was gonna be greenscreen involved, but Jesus Christ could they not do any better than this?! Most of the CGI is bad, real bad. Most of the greenscreen is obvious, real obvious. In fact it gets noticeably worse towards the end in my opinion. There are barely any practical effects which the first movie did incorporate in places. This movie is just ugly from top to bottom and its not helped by all the ludicrous action sequences. Its like half the movie wants to be like 'The Phantom', and the other half like 'Rambo'. Its such a clash of genres and tone.There is also a large plot hole in the way this story works, I think, unless I missed something. In the original Alan Parrish goes back to the point where he started playing the game in 1969 and changes time. This is obviously meant that Judith and Peter would never have played (in 1995) and wouldn't know anything about the game or Alan (having never met him). In this new movie the protagonists meet up with the kid (Alex) who got trapped in the game from 1996. When they all leave Alex goes back to the point he started playing in 1996 and changes time. So if he changed time, how come the four main protagonists still remember everything when they get back to their present day of 2016? Surely there's a chance they would never have ended up playing the game, or the game wouldn't have ended up in the school (?).Anyway once again I find myself completely mystified by a modern movies success. How on earth did this pile of crap make so much money? How on earth did people find this enjoyable?? I could maybe understand it if this was an original movie and the first had never existed, but it does exist! I simply cannot fathom how anyone can accept this utter garbage after the excellent original movie (complete with a terrific Robin Williams) which came out back in 1995. There are some neat little touches here and there, I like the evolution and mystery of the game, and Jack Black is always a pleasure. But apart from that, this was yet another cookie cutter Dwayne Johnson flick. CGI laden trash of the highest order.3.5/10",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

124,rockman182,Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017),8,22 December 2017,"The original Jumanji is a nostalgic film from my childhood. It still held up when I rewatched it earlier this month. The effects aren't the greatest but the film was fun and had a lot of heart. I was not one of those annoying people who had pitchforks out when they heard about Jumanji being rebooted or getting a sequel. Always give a film a chance, that's what I do. After seeing promo pics and trailers I was hyped. I like The Rock and Kevin Hart working together, and also love Karen Gillan. The film looked like a fresh spin on the original and even looked like an effort that wanted to stand on its own. It does exactly that. Say what you want, this is a very fun film.Four different teenagers are given detention and once there they discover an old video game named Jumanji. They plug the game system in and are sucked into the world of Jumanji, primarily in a jungle where they must return a jewel into an enormous Jaguar statue. Sounds easy, but the jungle is filled with tricks and traps and wild animals. Oh yeah, the four characters become the characters in the game physically. This makes for a very entertaining time with almost non stop humor on top of its adventure.The actors do very well in this. Jack Black and Kevin Hart bring the comedy. Jack Black's character is actually the embodiment of a self absorbed teenage girl, and he plays that remarkably well. I dig Kevin Hart with his loud commentary. I also love that he's always getting knocked over thrown around, in the way of danger, or in this films case- explodes. All the humor in this film comes at you tenfold and it all works. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat and, while somewhat predictable its never boring. The action scenes are gripping and grand scale. I loved the world of the film and the connection between the characters.The film has a few nods to the original but the film is still quite independent from the original which is nice. Really its in name alone; the connection to the first. Overall, its a blast at the end of the year. Its a re-watchable and exciting comedy/adventure. Take off your critical lenses and actually sit and enjoy this. The negative things I'm reading about this are analyzing it on such a deep level.

127,jon.h.ochiai,"Enjoy the ride in ""Jumanji""",9,24 December 2017,"I really enjoyed ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"". ""Jumanji"" is way more than its movie trailer. Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan are awesome. The Rock embodies a genuine ""nerd' charm in his action hero persona. It's nice to 'see' Karen not hidden behind the Nebula visage of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"". I'm a fan from her short lived series ""Selfie"". Gillan is beautiful, beguiling, and comedic charm. Jack Black as Shelly the gender swapped avatar practically steals the show illustrating the movie's surprising message. Game avatar Shelly, who's real life persona is ""it"" girl Bethany, schools now stunning Martha (Gillan) how be attractive to men. Shelly says, ""You're hot. Now own it."" Black offers comic relief in the video game mayhem as Shelly confesses to Smolder Bravestone (Johnson) and diminutive Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart) that having penis makes it so easy to pee. In the touching narrative arc, as their avatars in ""Jumanji"" Martha tells Bethany that she is so self-absorbed, consequently totally so selfish. Bethany tells Martha that she judges people first, before they have chance to hurt her. Director Jake Kasdan surprises not so much with the light hearted large-scale action with Johnson and Gillan kicking some ass battling motorcycle villains commanded by Bravestone's arch nemesis Van Pelt, played by ruthless vile Bobby Cannavale. Rather his poignant message in this video gamer movie is: Be who you are. This is amazing given that the screenplay based on the book, ""Jumanji"" has screenwriters Chis McKenna, Erik Sommer, Scott Rosenberg, and Jeff Pinker. Usually having that many writers inevitably generates kluge. Instead they are often touching. Young Spencer now The Rock's Bravestone has been in love with teen iconoclast Martha, now Ruby Roundhouse, since 7th grade. Both Johnson and Gillan are the most beautiful screen actors in paradox as Spencer says, ""I'm a nerd."" Martha says, ""I like nerds."" Bravestone fears death realizing that he only has one game ""life"" remaining in ""Jumanji"", doubting if he can save his friends and return the magical green jewel to the Jaguar statue. His friend Finbar, played by Hart, reminds that in the real world, ""We all only have one life."" So do your best. That's what anyone can do. Johnson is amazing movie star swag and gentle introspection as Bravestone. Hart is nervous comic energy as Finbar. He tells someone about his avatar's weakness, ""Cake makes me explode."" Don't often hear that one. Hart is also all heart. Their partnership along with Gillan and Black are about seeing others as greater than they know. In the end that's what makes you become. And perhaps, the hero arises from within. ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is derivative of ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"". 
""Jumanji"" does not aim to be as iconic, although it is about: Who you are? Who are you going to be? Young Spencer, Fridge, Bethany, and Martha, played convincingly by Alex Wolf, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman, and Morgan Turner, all enter the video game ""Jumanji"" as who they are. Perhaps, they transform as greater. Really that's up to them. Director Kasdan invites you along for the ride with cool martial arts and gorgeous locales. Go along for the ride. The ride is well worth it.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

On the one hand its simple, but on the other, it makes for a fast paced concept, that's ironically slower then you'd imagine. But surrounding it, is a story about facing your fears, growing up, and finishing something you started. Jumanji was one of my favorites as a child...and still is as an adult. A lot of that steams from Robin William's performance, which is more subtle then usual, and that the movie is genuinely scary. I even remember reading critical reviews that complained on how scary Jumanji was for children, but I think adults underestimate just how much children can take. So when it was announced that a sequel was being made, that generated a lot of responses, including how Robin Williams death makes continuing the story unnecessary. There is truth to that, and I'd be lying if I wasn't a skeptic. It changed when I found out that the characters were going into the game. Believe it or not, this is partially the plot for the Jumanji animated series from the nineties (which is pretty good if you can find it). So let's see if Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is just as entertaining. In the modern era, a group of high school kids are given detention. We have a hyprocondriac nerd Spencer (played by Alex Wolff), a sports jock footballer Anthony ""Fridge""(played by Ser'Darius Blain), a self centered Instagram star Bethany (played by Madison Iseman) and the shy bookworm Martha (played by Morgan Turner). While working, the kids find an old game console (think Nintendo 64) along with a playable game Jumanji. When they decide to play, they all select the chareters they want, and they get sucked into the game.Waking up in a jungle, the kids find they have changed into their chosen characters. Spencer is now Dr. Smolder Bravestone (played by Dwayne Johnson), Anthony is a zoologist Franklin ""Mouse"" (played by Kevin Hart), Martha is now a commando Ruby Roundhouse (played by Karen Gillan), and Bethany is Professor Sheldon (played by Jack Black). They find that if they want to escape, they have to finish the game of returning a jewel to a mountain. They also find that they have to succumb to the rules of video games...including that if they die three times, it's game over for good.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle succeeds in two areas. First, it does feel like an expansion of the world of Jumanji. I like that they show that the animals are just as intimidating...if not more, as they can be possessed. They have villages, airports, and of course, various enemies that are what's you'd expect from video games. Secondly, the movie works as a video game movie. The script makes a lot of jokes when it comes to how they work. Certain characters repeat information; our heroes know things will only get harder towards the end, and they even have certain weaknesses. The best part about this movie isn't even the jungle, but our main actors. That's because since their just video game avatars, guys like Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan play against their typical roles. Jack Black gets a lot of laughs as he plays up the idea that he's just a teenage girl on the inside. The only one whose playing himself is Kevin Hart, who doesn't do enough to act like a football player whose now shorter. But regardless, it was fun to see these four make the journey into the jungle, making this a lot like an Indiana Jones movie. The film does fall in certain areas. First of all, I was worried by the intro as I thought it was terrible. We get a scene of the Jumanji board game change itself into a video game just so people would play it (does it even know what video games are?). The high school parts are pretty stock. Just bland geeks, bland jocks, bland teachers, bland lockers, bland everything! It's clear that the storywriters cared more about the jungle sequences then school. I'll also say that parts of the film can be a little too heavy CGI (though it's a big step up from the effects of the original Jumanji), but it lacks a lot of the scares from the old movie that I loved. Oh well.I'll give this seven Jumanji board games out of ten. I'll admit that I was surprised by what I did enjoy out of this. It's different from before, but I'd rather have the sequel take more chances then to do a rehash. Families and fans of the original Jumanji will find plenty to like. Give it a roll and move forward.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

132,bankofmarquis,"A fun, family friendly, comedy adventure film",8,18 July 2018,"JUMANJI was a fun film from the middle 1990's, starring the late, great ROBIN WILLIAMS. And, when I heard that they were making a sequel to this film 22 years later and starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, I thought ""no thanks"" and even skipped seeking it out at movie theaters over the winter, even after I heard that it was ""pretty fun"".I finally caught up to it on a recent flight and I have to admit - I was wrong for skipping this film JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is a fun romp with The Rock ably filling the lead role, aided by a strong supporting cast.JUMANJI was about a board came come to life. JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE has the same board game that morphs itself into a video game and when 4 High Schoolers stumble across it while serving detention, well...comedy - and adventure - ensue.The four high schoolers are typical THE BREAKFAST CLUB stereotypes. The nerdy boy, the hot girl, the jock boy and the dorky girl. When these four are transported into the game they take on the outward appearance - and skills - of their video game characters - the nerdy body becomes the dashing hero (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). The hot girl becomes the dumpy (male!) professor (Jack Black). The jock becomes the un-athletic short kid (Kevin Hart) and the dorky girl becomes the kick-ass girl (Karen Gillan). It is the 4 actors playing their high school counterparts in their bodies that is the core of this film - and the center of the charm and fun of this film. All 4 shine. Johnson and Hart (back together after CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE) show that the chemistry they showed with each other in the previous film is no fluke. Gillan (Nebula in the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY films) shows that she can do kick-ass well - and with a wink in her eye. But it is the performance of Black that steals things. Someone said to me that Black was made to play a ""hot high school girl"" and I would have to agree. He almost steals the movie.Director Jake Kasdan (the TV series NEW GIRL) understands what kind of film that he is making, so keeps the fun and action going at a superficial, almost cartoon level, never really stopping to breathe (or to think). He keeps things light - and family friendly - with just enough ""almost"" dirty jokes to keep young and old alike interested. It earns - but never crosses the line - of it's PG-13 rating. There is talk of a sequel, and I, for one, am looking forward to it.Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
133,Anurag-Shetty,A perfect tribute & follow-up to Jumanji(1995).,10,5 January 2018,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle tells the story of young Spencer(Alex Wolff), Fridge(Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany(Madison Iseman) & Martha(Morgan Turner). These four high school students, get pulled into a video game called Jumanji. They also get turned into their respective game avatars. Now, Spencer(Dwayne Johnson), Fridge(Kevin Hart), Bethany(Jack Black) & Martha(Karen Gillan) have to finish the game, to return to the real world. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a thoroughly entertaining film. Director Jake Kasdan has successfully introduced Jumanji to a new generation, while also honoring the 1995 Robin Williams classic. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is immersive(especially in IMAX). The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. My favorites are the helicopter scene & the climax. The effortless camaraderie among the four main cast members is another strong-point of the film. Dwayne Johnson is spectacular as Spencer. Kevin Hart is hysterical as Fridge. Jack Black is hilarious as Bethany. Karen Gillan is outstanding as Martha. Together, Johnson, Hart, Black & Gillan make the audience guffaw uncontrollably, with their histrionics. Rhys Darby is impressive as Nigel. Bobby Cannavale is great as Van Pelt. Nick Jonas is amazing as Alex. Alex Wolff, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman & Morgan Turner are awesome as Young Spencer, Young Fridge, Young Bethany & Young Martha, respectively.

134,fernandoschiavi,"Now, instead of fearing Jumanji, the audience must want to become a character in the game, since you become a great hero and gain superpowers",7,30 January 2021,"Produced by Columbia Pictures, Matt Tolmach Productions, Radar Pictures and Seven Bucks Productions and distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment, this sequel to the classic Jumanji (1995) stars Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan and Nick Jonas. Always remembered for the special effects and wild animals that the evil game brought to the real world, the 1995 feature brought a mixture of comedy and suspense that sets the tone of adventure of the 1990s. More than 20 years later, the franchise is reborn without this footprint, more frantic, with few animals, video game aesthetics and focused on comedy.In Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, four teenagers find a video game that takes place in a tropical forest. Excited about the game, they choose their avatars for the challenge, but an unexpected event causes them to be transported into the fictional universe, becoming the characters of the adventure.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, thankfully, it doesn't usually appeal to cheap nostalgia or try to remind you, on a recurring basis, that this is a sequence from a 90's movie. The feature has a microcosm and a tone that is partly its own, more like current comedies than Robin Williams' Jumanji - which can be a problem depending on your expectations. The new version distances itself a lot from the original work of Chris Van Allsburg, author of the book, and only keeps small references, just to justify the definition as a sequel, and to attract the older audience that watched the original. In its second version, Jumanji is no longer a board game. In fact, the game received an update and was transformed into a video game to suit the new generation. Unlike the original film, Welcome to the Jungle is divided into two very distinct parts: one presenting the characters in the real world and the other with their respective avatars within the video game.When announced it was the fact that now, the characters would enter Jumanji through a video game, breaking all the magic of the original board. Fortunately, even this has been well worked out and the transition from one format to another is well justified, showing that Jumanji is a game that does everything to be played. In the first half hour, director Jake Kasdan quickly introduces the four characters in a fun and light rhythm, reminiscent of excerpts from The Club of Five and Mean Girls, with their respective defects established right away (and consequent defined arcs) will enter a unforgettable journey when they go to detention and end up with an updated version of Jumanji. By selecting different characters, each of the young people will be transported to the Jumanji universe and there will undergo transformations that will change their perspectives on who they are and what roles they have in real life. First of all, however, the goal will be to save that jungle from the fearsome Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), an extremely generic and boring villain who, inexorably, ends up becoming a parody of himself, clearly unintentionally.After the presentation of the real world characters, unlike the original film, the narrative structure throws us into the jungle that Alan Parrish, played by the late Robin Williams, was transported during those 26 years, without bringing, as previously done, the jungle to the real life. If the same event were repeated, we would certainly lose all the margin of originality that could be achieved, while here we have a story that deepens the forest and brings with it a sense of novelty, even exploring known narrative paths. This also opens up possibilities for Alan Parrish himself, and, of course, his interpreter, to be lightly honored with an exciting score. In the essence of Welcome to the Jungle, this is a continuation that pays tribute to the splendid figure that was Williams, in terms of his smiles and celebrations.In Jumanji's jungle, the best idea of the script is to notice how the roles are reversed creating good opportunities for humor: real-life nerds become Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) and Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillian), the strong characters of the game. Popular people receive support avatars: the athlete is reduced to playing Bravestone biologist and henchman, Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart), while the girl adored at school enters the shoes of cartographer Shelly Oberon (Jack Black). The artifice of changing the body gives good material for the actors to play with and most of the initial jokes work with it. It's fun to see The Rock surprise itself with its muscles and not knowing how to act in battle, but Jack Black is the one who steals the show in the film. Playing a selfish girl, the actor creates very funny mannerisms and delivers a comic interpretation in the right measure, with conscious exaggerations that amuse and almost never fall into the shame of others - something that could easily happen to such a character.The comedy varies greatly in both tone and quality. The duo The Rock and Kevin Hart head the film with the same kind of comedy we saw in One and a Half: lots of jokes with the difference in size of the two, Hart screaming thin in trouble, jokes with sexual organs and so on. Although not bad, the duo is the weakest comic part of the feature. Gillian's character, who generated a lot of controversy when appearing in the film's publicity photos in very short clothes, has her moments and the girl's constant dissatisfaction with the provocative look of her avatar develops a criticism of the objectification of the woman's figure in games and entertainment as a whole (Tomb Raider's reference to Lara Croft is obvious). The actress knows how to be funny, beautiful and sensual as few can.While focusing on comedy, the new Jumanji forgets a little about the action. When he does, he is unable to provide scenes that are impactful or stay with the viewer until the end of the film. The idea really doesn't seem to stick to explosions, chases or fights - the whole action part of Welcome to the Jungle is in the background. And if there is a fan of the original feature who appreciates Joe Johnston's suspense, it will come out disappointed. The proposal here is to be a light adventure, uncompromised and directed towards comedy. In addition, the missions are not very well built, and the story is beyond forgettable, with a predictable and formulaic ending, obeying the rules of limited lives and skills / weaknesses in a bureaucratic way. In parallel to the villainous blasé of Cannavale, it is interesting that much of the character's background is given through the cut scenes already mentioned.The film can be as predictable as you might think. The plot of the film does what it needs, it takes the characters from point A to point B, and that's all you need to do. The fact that the characters are jokingly trapped in a video game, not taking themselves seriously. There are many moments when Chris McKenna's script has fun with basic clichés that only make sense in games. The film laughs at cut scenes entering and leaving the characters confused, NPC dialogues purposely expository to play with the way video game characters are written, among several other virtuous games with the media.Although it does not take itself seriously, the work sins in several points: the villain is bad, there is no development and much less a motivation besides ""taking over the world"". Many jokes are repeated over and over, which makes the mood tiring at times; the writers also don't seem to believe in the viewer's ability and explain extremely basic things about the plot countless times and in the silliest ways possible. The script takes many unnecessary turns, to the point that unfounded challenges are created in the final half of the film. The few moments when they try to create a dramatic arc are also meager - and Nick Jonas' acting as Alex doesn't help. Every part where the film tries to create a meaningful relationship for the virtual characters is shallow and poorly developed and that is a huge problem in the outcome of the film.Jumanji is a symbol of childhood for many and with the reboot it should continue to be, now for a new generation. Only the name, the game and one or another creature are kept from the original. Jumanji's continuation is, above all, a pleasant surprise, extremely fun, with a wittiness that refers to both the original film and the modern video games. With good action scenes handled by director Jake Kasdan, Welcome to the Jungle is guaranteed fun. Did you need to have the name Jumanji and get hold of an already known brand? No. Unfortunately, the darker tone and the harmless touches of fear that the game brought to the cinema are neglected. Now, instead of fearing Jumanji, the audience must want to become a character in the game, since you become a great hero, gain superpowers and face threats that scare little the most fearful of warriors. The script choices, always following the easiest ways to resolve conflicts, create a film that is unlikely to mark an era, like the original feature film. It is a pastime, clearly unpretentious, which does not trust the intelligence of its viewer at various times. Despite having some Easter eggs from the original 'Jumanji', Jake Kasdan delivers an original adventure that manages to innovate, as well as the title game.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
135,MihaiSorinToma,Jumanji: The Very Entertaining Video Game Adventure,9,19 September 2018,"Four very different teenagers are sucked into a video game and transported to the world of Jumanji. Each equipped with an unique set of skills but also weaknesses, they must find a way to finish the game before remaining out of lives in order to go back to their own world.It's a movie which follows about the same concept as the original flick, but also improving it in terms of visual effects. The four new characters are very likeable and funny, playing their part very well in the adventure that follows. Their evolution as teenagers and their relationship with one another is also presented in detail, presenting how each is able to overcome his condition with the help of the others. Their part is the most important, very well played by the actors, contributing decisively to the outcome. Using plenty of references to video games, this movie manages to create a very entertaining atmosphere in which the action can take part. Speaking of which, we have plenty of it, exaggerated of course as they are part of a video game, but still very enjoyable.The plot isn't much as far as the game is concerned, but it is good enough to keep it all together and make it a very good all-rounder. It's not predictable or linear, even having a mystery to be guessed, but it's not breath-taking either. It excels though through dialog, character complexity and development, making it very good in this department. The visual effects however are top notch. It truly is a delight for the eyes to see all the action sequences and all other events which are made possible using CGI.It's a movie which I truly enjoyed. It manages to create a good time for its viewers, while having some great actors who play their characters with style. It's not spectacular in terms of story but it makes up through action, suspense, CGI and even a bit of drama. A very good watch overall.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
136,brookenichole-98054,A fun time!,9,5 March 2020,"Jumanji is without a doubt one of the best acted movies ever. Everyone shines in their own way. You would think one of the actors/actress would not play the part of the teens that well but boy did they succeed. This movie is hilarious with its constant jokes. I laughed at every joke. The adventure of getting there was also fun. It feels like you're actually playing the video game.
Dwayne Johnson plays the nerdy kid who shines as the leader. Karen Gillan plays as the introverted kid who is awkward but cute. Kevin Hart is the funny jock who has lost half his height and is now taken down a couple notches. And Jack Black is honestly the best of them all. He made me laugh and smile. He plays the teen girl who is self absorbed and is phone dependent. He aced playing her. He was exactly like almost every teen girl today. Nick Jonas was a great surprise too. He was great at playing the 90's kid who said the 90's terms.
Overall I have seen this movie so many times now and I still laugh and love it.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
137,bob-the-movie-man,The most fun you can have with Jack Black.,7,21 December 2017,"In 1995, Joe Johnston (""The Rocketeer"", ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") directed ""Jumanji"" - a quirky, fantastical and dark film starring the late, great Robin Williams that got a rough critical reception at the time of release, but was embraced by the public and has gone on to be a modern classic. So when it was announced that a sequel was in the works 22 years later, my first reaction was ""Oh no... is nothing sacred?"". It's fair to say that I went into this flick with extremely low expectations.But I have to say that - given this low base - I was pleasantly surprised. It's actually quite a fun fantasy film that I predict that older kids will adore. Initially set (neatly) in 1995, a teen - Alex (Nick Jonas, of the Jonas Brothers) unearths the board game Jumanji where it ended up buried in beach-sand at the end of the last film. ""Who plays board games any more?"" he scoffs, which the game hears and morphs into a game cartridge. Cheesy? Yes, but no more crazy than the goings on of the first film. Back in 2017, four high-school teens - geeky Spencer (Alex Wolff, ""Patriot's Day""); sports-jock Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain); self-obsessed beauty Bethany (Madison Iseman); and self-conscious, nerdy and shy Martha (Morgan Turner) - find the game and are sucked into it, having to complete all the game levels before they can escape.But they are not themselves in the game; they adopt the Avatars they chose to play: Dr Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson, ""San Andreas""); Moose Finbar (Kevin Hart, ""Get Hard""); Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan, ""Dr Who"", ""The Circle""; ""Guardians of the Galaxy""); and Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black, ""Sex Tape"", ""Kong""). Can they combine their respective game talents - and suppress the human mental baggage they brought with them - to escape the game?There was a really dark time-travelling angle to the storyline of the original film - the traumatic start of Disney's ""Flight of the Navigator"" was perhaps also borrowed from the concept in the book by Chris Van Allsburg - and an attempt is made to recreate this in the sequel. The first film rather pulled its punches though in favour of a rather Hollywood ending: will this be the case this time? The film delivers laughs, but in a rather inconsistent fashion - it is mostly smile-worthy rather than laugh-out-loud funny. Much fun is had with the sex change of Bethany's character, with Jack Black's member featuring - erm - prominently. The characters all have strengths and weaknesses, like a game of Top Trumps, and this also entertains. But the most humour derives from the ""three lives and it's game over"" device giving the opportunity for various grisly ends, often relating to the above referenced weaknesses. Given the cast that's been signed up, the acting is not exactly first rate although Karen Gillan shines as the brightest star. But ""it's not bloody Shakespeare"" so ham-acting is not that much of a problem and the cast all have fun with their roles. Dwayne Johnson in particular gets to play out of character as the 'nerd within the hunk', and his ""smouldering look"" skill - arched eyebrow and all - is hilarious. Rhys Darby, looking so much like Hugh Jackman that I had to do several double takes, also turns up as an English game-guide in a Land Rover, and Bobby Cannavale (""Ant Man"") is Van Pelt, the villain of the piece.There has been much controversy over Karen Gillan's child-sized outfit. But she is clearly a parallel to the well-endowed Lara Croft, and young male teens didn't play that game for the jungle scenery! She is meant to be a hot and sexy video game character, and man - does she deliver! Gillan is not just hot in the film: she is #lavahot. This makes her comic attempts at flirting lessons (as the internally conflicted Martha) especially funny. Hats off to her stunt doubles as well, for some awe-inspiring martial arts fight scenes.Fans of ""Lost"" will again delight in the Jumanji scenery, surely one of the most over-used film locations in Hawaii if not the world!Where the film gets bogged down is in too much cod-faced philosophizing over the teenager's ""journeys"". This is laid on in such a clunky manner in the early (slow!) scenes that the script could have been significantly tightened up. And as I said above, the script - written, rather obviously, by a raft of writers - could have been so much funnier. Most of the humour comes from visually seeing what's happening: not from the dialogue.Directed by Jake Kasdan (son of director and Star Wars/Raiders screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan) it's really not half as bad as it could have been or as I feared, and I would gladly watch it again. For it's target audience, which is probably kids aged 10 to 14, I think they will love it. And, unlike many holiday films, the parents won't be totally bored either (especially the Dads, for the obvious misogynistic reasons outlined above!).",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Instead of trying to redo something that didn't need redoing, they took the movie in a different direction, letting the viewer enter the jungle of Jumanji.The cast in this film was amazing! The jokes were perfect and suited the characters perfectly. No one else could have pulled this off but Jack Black, The Rock and Kevin Hart.The downfalls of the movie was that the CGI was terrible, the film dragged on a little with constant action scenes and there's absolutely no depth to the show.

141,kjproulx,A Fun Ride For Fans Of The Original,7,3 January 2018,"It has been over 20 years since the release of the original Jumanji, and quite honestly, I never once thought about ever needing a sequel or revamp of that classic material. I mean, just over ten years ago we saw a great little film in Zathura, so I had my fill of this type of movie. That being said, I never thought I'd be writing a review that tells people to go out and see a film that completely altered what the original film was, but here I am. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a really fun time at the movies. I won't be comparing it to the original because they both fit their times. Although it's not without its issues, here's why I believe Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle deserves to be seen in theatres.Being a fan of the original film, I wasn't too keen on the video game aspect that this sequel was injecting into the franchise, but it really worked for me in the context of the story. As the film follows four very generically-stereotyped characters in Spencer, Fridge, Bethany, and Martha, they find themselves stuck in detention after school hours. Coming across an old video game console, they plug it into the television and are sucked into the world of Jumanji. Yes, the question everyone will be asking is how the board game is now a video game, but the movie does a solid job in nodding to the fans about that.After being sucked into the game, they become the avatars they chose. The characters, played by Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan are all fantastic here, playing though they're still their outside selves. This aspect is what makes the movie worth it because it allows them to discover new things about themselves, either giving them bravery or realizing life is just fine for them in the outside world. The morals of the story and the climax itself has been seen in thousands of movies throughout the years, but it's all about how a movie is executed these days, and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle sucks you in with these characters and provides a very fun adventure, for the most part.This film asks you to pretend that you're actually in a video game with these characters, so repetitive dialogue from secondary characters can become hilarious if you're thinking with that mindset, but also odd for those who are unfamiliar with video games. This brings me to my biggest negative about this movie, because a video game follows either one or multiple characters at the same time, making discoveries along the way. A video game never cuts away to show other plot-lines forming, but this movie does feel like an actual movie at times, cutting away to the villain of the story, who's also the weakest aspect of it as well.The villain, played by Bobby Cannavale (who I'm actually a huge fan of as an actor), is far too over-the-top in this role, which can be funny at times, but it feels out of place when placing random scenes of him and his henchmen throughout the movie. Personally, this portion of the film annoyed me and I couldn't wait to get back to the central characters.In the end, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is fun for fans of the original, providing winks and nods to the first film throughout the movie, as well as providing a fun adventure for all newcomers. From bumping into characters like Alex (Nick Jonas) in order to add some emotional aspects, to having some pretty cool action sequences, to providing humor that both adults and kids can laugh at, I didn't have any glaring issues with the film itself, aside from the incredibly annoying villain subplot.

Johnson has been sequel viagara for various film franchises, and Jumanji definitely deserved a fresh take. There's a lot of solid idea's here, but it can't maintain the long duration. The film was respectful, but they make an odd choice to have the teens remember the game. In the original Dunsts character and her brother don't remember the game.

Four teenagers are stuck in school detention, they are a nerd, a football star, a shy girl and a media obsessed posh girl.They find a dusty vintage computer game console, switch it on and choose their avatars, these are nothing like themselves in fact they are their opposites.

You may remember the original from 1995 with Robin Williams, though you don't need to know anything about the original, or needed to have watched it to see this.What really makes this film work is the chemistry and humour between the characters.

145,anselmdaniel,A fun movie about video games,7,18 January 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fantasy adventure comedy movie that premiered in 2017. The movie is directed by Jake Kasdan, produced by Matt Tolmach, and William Teitler. The story is written by Chris McKenna. The movie stars Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas. The movie is a successor to 1995's movie Jumanji. Jumanji which was once a board game becomes a video game that traps school students that play it. The students must work past their differences and cooperate in order to beat the game and win freedom.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a pleasant surprise. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle has interesting concepts and execution. The movie became interesting to watch simply because of the ideas it has that represent video games on movies. This is not a video game movie but rather a movie that is based on concepts found in video games. There is still a plot that is akin to movies and the movie uses this to good effect by lampooning concepts found in video games. A running gag in the movie is that non-playable characters simply repeat lines. This is used to good effect by the characters being introduced to non-playable characters not replying to what the players throw at them.The plot of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is basic. This movie has four students that become trapped that ultimately has to solve the mystery of why a student went missing years before. There is not a villain in this movie. There are only obstacles that the students must overcome that are present in the video game they become trapped in. The movie serves these concepts of obstacles well as the characters of Spencer Gilpin, Bethany Walker, Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson, and Martha Kaply have to overcome their differences in order to escape the video game. The actors that play these characters' avatars do an admirable job in the roles. They portray the underlying characters well and it leads to hilarious events in the movie.The movie does have some missed opportunities. I felt that the movie's plot was so basic that it could have been expanded for comedic effect. There are many tropes in video games that could have applied to this movie that are relatable by the audience. If some of these events were shown like a fog-of-war effect or a rendering limit, it could have been fun seeing the player characters see this limitation.I would recommend 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle'. This is a solid movie and it serves as more of a spiritual successor to 1995's Jumanji movie.Grade: B",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
146,msbreviews,Rating: B,7,8 April 2018,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This is one of the best surprises of 2017, simply because no one expected this film to be this funny and entertaining! While the original movie has its moments, it loses itself in its silliness and nonsense. Jake Kasdan's installment proves to be a well-directed remake/reboot/sequel/whatever with a hilarious screenplay and a fast pacing (plus a cool score).Nevertheless, without this cast, it wouldn't be as good as it is. The fact that everyone (except Kevin Hart) portrays an anti-type character is itself remarkable. Watching a beast like Dwayne Johnson play an easily scared kid or Jack Black acting like he is a young teenage girl trapped in a middle-aged man's body is something that I never thought I needed until I actually witnessed it. Karen Gillan also does a fantastic job and Bobby Cannavale, unfortunately, is just portraying a villain who shows up once in a while, for a few seconds.Still, the film has its narrative flaws and two of them are arguably plot holes. The CGI sometimes is too noticeable and it bothered me a little. Basically, if you are able to accept or ignore the story's lack of logic on some details, you are in for a hell of a ride. It's entertaining from beginning to end and it even has some unexpected emotional moments, so if you need to watch an adventurous comedy with some friends at home, watch Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.

I saw the film with the two stars at the Dubai International Film Festival.Haven't seen the first Jumanji movie, I had no idea how the movie is going to be. The film started like a usual teenage movie. Later, it was one of the best comedy adventure movies I have seen.4 students were sent to detention. They found an old video game and decided to play it. Apparently they were sucked into the game and the fun begins. In the game, they adopted the body of the characters they choose. They had weakness and power.A guaranteed entertainer.

150,Min111,It's not a fun game,1,10 January 2020,"This movie had a lot of potential, but it didn't make the most of it. Why is that? because of the success of the original movie: Jumanji. The original Jumanji was so good they could afford to make another ""good"" Jumanji movie, but this Jumanji, Welcome to the Jungle, wasn't good. I liked the beginning scene where someone finds the board game at the beach, but then suddenly, it turns into a video game or something. I didn't like that. I was expecting a much better Jumanji movie. The title for this movie was good: ""Welcome to the Jungle"". I liked that. The game wasn't so good. The characters though were interesting - I must say! I'm surprised that there would be a sequel to Jumanji, as I thought that there would never be one. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a poor movie.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
151,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,13 May 2021,"After so much mistrust, the sequel to the classic Jumanji finally arrives in theaters, and it surprises when it shows itself as a fun movie. However does he live up to the name he carries? The beginning of the story is short and simple, featuring the four protagonists, completely different students who are united by a day of detention. During the time of punishment they find an old video game console in the school pantry, and start the game online. When each of them selects one of the four avatars, they are then sucked into the game world, where they need to complete all the stages in order to then be able to return to their world. As already mentioned, the presentation of the characters in the real world is very short and serves well to introduce each character, which work as clichés in the best club style of the five (only of the four). The patricinha, the sportsman, the nerd and the stranger are present, and the dynamics between them work well. The whole thing becomes more fun when entering the game, when the characters start to use the body of the avatars they have chosen, and there is an exchange of roles. The nerd, for example, has the strongest and most athletic character, while the patricinha takes the place of the chubby cartographer. This exchange of roles is hilarious and well explored. Jack Black acting like a patricinha is priceless. Another factor also contributes too much to the fun of the film: the debauchery that is made with the elements of video games. The presence of cutscenes and NPCs with limited programmed phrases and so on. If you think about it, there is even a phase in the sewer haha. The fact that the film takes place within a game is used to not take itself seriously and yields good jokes. I have pointed out so far that the film is successful in entertaining the public. However, it is not much of that. There is a certain excess of jokes, some getting out of the mood that could develop better, or just plain dull. A lot of the boring jokes come from Kevin Hart, curious ... A lot of the action scenes are cool, but the final confrontation against the big bad guy is kind of confusing, and some cuts throughout the film are weird and confusing. Anyway, the film doesn't try to take itself too seriously, and the negative points are less highlighted like that. As for the name Jumanji in the title, it is another discussion. The justification for the game to be digital this time is there, as well as references to the first film. However, in my opinion the continuation has little of the atmosphere of the first, the jungle and its elements seeming to have little importance.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
152,RussHog,Trash,1,14 August 2018,Everything about this movie is bad. Even the stuff that is sorta good. (Which is the chemistry between the cast.). The original is a masterpiece of good news v bad news in an action story. Robin Williams gave an iconic performance. The jungle sequences were insane. This film has almost no good jungle sequences and it's just the characters who do a lot of bad jokes. Everyone involved who made this project disgusts me.,Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

155,Alexander_Blanchett,Surprisingly great adventure flick,8,21 May 2018,"I avoided the film for a long time. First of all I did like the first Jumanji but did not nescessairly think it deserved or needed a sequel. Then I wasn't quite sold on this sequels potential even when it became a major hit I just thought it as just another Hollywood cash cow. 
Now I finally gave it a try and I am glad I did. The film turns out to be one of the most entertaining features of 2017 with a major rewatch-effect.
The story works because even though it is modern and works on modern action and humor it still has something nostalgic added to it which made it very appealing. Also the way the characters are written is that they could easily have been of a 90s film (more or less). I loved the idea that some kids become their total opposite Avatars in the video game. Also their relations made the film more interesting than its special effects which is another reason it worked.
The adult actors played well and most of them actually played with their own image. There was. lot of self irony attached. Really loved Dwayne Johnson who gives one of his better performances. Kevin Hart was sometimes a bit annoying but it worked with his character. Jack Black was easily the MVP. He cracked me up every time he was on screen. Such a clumsy performance, but in a good way. Karen Gillan was also great and totally unlike her most famous Marvel character. The special effects were good. The action worked. The ending was touching. All those elements made it to one of the best adventure flicks of last year.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
156,CANpatbuck3664,A Fun Concept and Great Cast Carry Jumanji Over Cheesy Dialogue and Sentimentality,7,31 December 2017,"If you play video games and are open to the actors/actresses in this cast, it would be hard not to geek out over this concept. Video game movies are hit and miss at best and maybe this was a new way to help that along. They took an existing property and made it a video game movie. There were cool instances where they brought in aspects of video games that genuinely worked (I liked the non-playable character gag where they can only have a few responses) and then there were other times where it was a little awkward and didn't translate effectively (the concept of the lives was a little clunky, they lost lives falling from some heights and not others and then using CPR to transfer one?). I have to admire their ambition but only partial points for execution.This is an action/comedy geared more towards families than adult audiences. Does it work on that level? I would say yes. The movie isn't hilarious but there were plenty of times where I was chuckling, and it also had some decent action in it. I don't think the movie was exceptional in either area, but it did its job. I did like how they brought in some Indiana Jones style elements too. Using specific traps and the returning the treasure to its rightful place were nice additions and made it feel like it was playing towards an old school adventure movie.I did have a couple of big problems with this movie. I felt like the characters of the kids were way too stereotypical (the awkward nerd, the self-involved pretty girl, the dumb jock etc.). I know that they can't be all completely fresh characters, but they still could have added a little more dimension by going in a different direction. The other is that the movie has some dialogue so bad that it will make you roll your eyes and snicker. I couldn't help but giggle at it (in an unintentionally funny way) and I know the movie is directed at kids but again I think they could have put a little more effort in. Other than playing with this cool idea, I thought the script for this was pretty mediocre. I also had a personal nitpick about more contemporary gaming being not referenced at all but that's admittedly due to the fact I wasn't involved in that era of gaming and I don't have a detailed memory of those type of games.As much as I had a couple of problems with the material, I wouldn't blame any of the main cast for it. Alex Wolff, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman and Morgan Turner as Spencer, Fridge, Bethany and Martha were all okay. They didn't really impress me, but I think that was more the material than anything. The adult actors all really sold out. Dwayne Johnson is his usual charming self, Kevin Hart is funny in spurts, Karen Gillan was great in her role and the meta jokes about her character were pretty funny. Jack Black was just short of mugging the entire movie but he was one of the few actors who could have made his part work. The biggest surprise was that I didn't mind Nick Jonas all that much. Bobby Cannavale is a good actor but his villain was so forgettable that it wasn't worth an actor of his calibre.I was psyched going into this movie, the scores across the board were better than expected and I thought the marketing for it was pretty good. I walked out having enjoyed Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle but I did feel like it had the potential to be even better. Its doing well at the box office so maybe I'll like the sequel (if there is one) that much more. I would definitely like to see this cast again with the strong chemistry they had. I'd give it a 7/10.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

This is a throwback movie down to the epic music. This is just a plain fun movie. Despite the fact that there are missing elements from the original, this movie boosts the dusty board game concept into the video game concept (it's like the movies ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" both are good, but you just need an extra jump start).
It was then no surprise to see Jake Kasdan direct this, as there is smart set-up (their abilities and weaknesses) and payoff (not going to give it away). I am going to bet right now, he is going to direct some ""Star Wars"" movie in the future (as his dad Lawrence Kasdan, wrote arguably the best one so far).
Yes, there are lingering questions after the fact, but it makes sense now why Dwayne Johnson is the star he is. He is not above being a nerd, doing nerdy things.

159,dilipbts,Jumanji welcome to the jungle,8,10 June 2020,"Reboots can be tricky. While some click, most of them crumble under the pressure to shake off the barrage of comparisons that would be thrown at the movie. Last couple of years saw such horrible reboots like Jurassic World, The Mummy, Kong: Skull Island. But much like Spiderman: Homecoming, Jumanji succeeds to impress the viewers. Jumanji gets a modern age makeover where now instead of a board game it is a video game. Four teenagers with varying personalities are put together in a detention. Here they discover the Jumanji video game and enter the world of Jumanji as their avatars. Then starts the fun ride. There are enough plot holes like how did the video game end up in a high school from Alex's freak house. The movie uses time tested cliche - Four teenagers with some flaw realize their shortcomings when (literally) seen from some other's point of view. But the fun parts of the movie makes us forget them, at least till the movie ends.The movie does not take itself seriously, and that is a huge plus point. The plot of the movie is crazy, there are man eating albino (what?!) rhinos on one side and villainous henchmen with crazy mud racing bike skills on the other side. But such craziness has been ridiculed in the movie itself, which makes you fall in love with it more.The bigger plus for the movie has been the performance of the lead actors. All of them have created niche for themselves in the film industry. Jumanji has used such niche beautifully and built very funny characters. Parts where Dwayne Johnson(Spencer) stops to admire his own physique will have you in splits. Not to mention his hilarious display of 'smoldering intensity'. Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart and Jack Blake as a women in a man's body is perfect. Karen Gillan, who is this mean Nebula in MCU, comes up with a very charming performance.All in all, Jumanji is a movie that you can watch without any regret.

I am not huge fans of other movies by these actors, but this really worked. You could see the great chemistry between them all and it paid off.What I liked: I enjoyed how it didn't dither about at the beginning and got right into the action. Jack Black especially was brilliant and hilarious! All the actors/actresses were great but Jack Black stood out. Good mix of action and comedy throughout. I was on the edge of my seat (metaphorically) wanting them to escape the game.Negatives: not many to be honest, couple of scenes were slightly cringe, but not off putting. Same logic goes for a couple of scenes which felt dragged out.I think people need to forget about this being a remake of a classic film and treat it as a separate movie altogether. If you start comparing the 2 that's when it goes wrong.Ps.. Karen Gillan. Marry me please?Worth watching and will be going cinema for 2nd instalment.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
163,PyroSikTh,Martha!,7,23 January 2018,"Like many my age, I enjoyed the original Jumanji when it first came out, and I even watched the animated show that followed as well. I always felt my memories of Jumanji were actually better than it was though, and even now I can't remember a whole lot about it.What I can remember though is that Welcome to the Jungle picks up from the original's cliffhanger; with the board game washing up on the beach, and claiming it's first victim in it's new video game guise to act as this movies Alan Parrish. Fast forward twenty years to the present day and we're introduced to a varied, if slightly cliché, group of high schoolers. During detention, they find the video game, plug it in, and get sucked into the world of Jumanji, updated for the video game generation.What follows is like an amalgamation of Breakfast Club, Freaky Friday, and Tropic Thunder. Each teenager is put into a new body, in a game character who holds a completely new role for them to play than they do in their lives. The two popular/athletic kids are stuck in brainy, physically-diminished bodies, while the two nerds are stuck in attractive, athletic bodies. Many of the jokes hinge on these body swaps, and while you can see where these jokes go before they even happen, they still manage to feel fresh and funny. Seeing Dwayne Johnson play an awkward, jumpy kid is always funny. Always.On that note, the core cast are pretty great on the whole, which actually really surprised me. At no point did I watch them and think 'oh hey that's Dwayne Johnson being goofy'. Instead they managed to capture the essence of being a teenager perfectly to the point that I still considered them teenagers, as if some sort of acting voodoo had occured that literally swapped the body's of the actors. Barring Kevin Hart, who literally just plays Kevin Hart the whole time. But Karen Gillan fits snug in the nerdy, socially awkward character of Martha so effortlessly that she even keeps the character going when she's just in the background and not the main focus. She also has a surprising amount of comedy chops too. Seeing her attempt and fail to flirt and be sexy is worth the price of admission alone. (And on the note of her outfit, it's a video game, that's the entire point)That said Jack Black steals the show as Bethany. While sometimes he can find it hard to break free of being himself, at other times he can be truly transformative, and Welcome to the Jungle is one of those times. He's not Jack Black here, he's a teenage white girl obsessed with her phone and her looks. The way he marvels at being able to pee standing up, or teaching Martha how to flirt, or giving Nick Jonas mouth-to-mouth, or staring at Dwayne Johnson wide-eyed and gushing. He really channels his inner teenage girl so well that's hard to take him any other way. He steals the show. Of course it helps that Bethany becomes one of the best developed characters in the entire movie. She starts out stereotypically self-absorbed, and almost cringeworthy in her obsession with selfies and instagram. But as the movie develops we see new sides to her. Away from her phone, she's understanding and smart, and at no point is she played as a ditsy blonde that this kind of movie would fall back on for jokes.The character of Bethany is more of an exception than the rule when it comes to character development though. Martha and Spencer enjoy a little bit from being put in attractive, athletic bodies for once, and the newfound confidences that brings, but otherwise they come out the other end the same nerdy teenagers they were before. Fridge is even worse. He's a terrible human being throughout the entire movie until the coda where they're all suddenly best friends. The villain is horrifically underutilised as well. He's a snarling, one-dimensional villain without motivations, put in there just to give a human antagonist to fight against. I wouldn't be surprised if Bobby Cannavale wasn't happy with how his character turned out in the end.Humour is top-notch and is the movie's sole reason for existence. It makes it not only bearable, but genuinely enjoyable to watch. It takes it's jokes from a variety of genres, from slapstick, to wit, to the whole body swap thing, but never relies on cringe or gross-out moments. It also manages to keep its humourous tone consistent throughout, never getting too serious, or conversely making light of more serious moments.Of course what this does mean is that Welcome to the Jungle does not feel like Jumanji at all. It's a fun adventure romp with teenagers body-swapping into a jungle game. The opening with the recreated cliffhanger from the original, and even a name-drop or two of Alan Parrish are all well and good, but they don't alter the fact that Welcome to the Jungle completely lacks any of the scares or fantasy established in that first film. There's no mutant animals or plants at all, and the tone is consistently light and upbeat, opting for surface entertainment than taking the opportunity to explore something deeper. The introduction of each character having three lives is smart, but it takes out much of the threat and danger of the place.Another minor niggle is the overabundance of needless CGI to create stunts and interesting fight choreography. I'm not usually one to complain about the use of CGI, but here it really stands out, enough to break the immersion and make you realise you are actually watching a movie. The music as well is super bland, and almost dated. Maybe that's deliberate to harken back to the original, but for such a modern re-telling it feels out-of-place and a little cheesy.In all Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is the definition of a safe family movie. It doesn't attempt to break any moulds or try anything new, and in fact shirks the tone of the franchise entirely just to keep it all feeling a little more vanilla. That said, and this is crucial, it's a movie that knows exactly what it is. It's cheap, surface-level entertainment, and in that is a rip-roaring success. It drags you into the world of these teenagers, never breaks character, and will keep you smiling and laughing from beginning to end. I cannot say that I had a terrible time or that I didn't like the movie, because despite being aimed at the lowest common denominator, it does it so well that I got sucked in just like everyone else. I give it an enjoyable 7/10.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

And by being pulled in these two directions it ends up sitting directly in the middle and ending up being almost entirely bland. The uninspiring locations and effects don't even have the zip and pep of Zathura, Jumanji's semi-sequel, and it carries none of the atmosphere, dread and unique tone of the original Jumanji. It's another in a long line of 'videogamey'-inspired films written or producer-curated by people who have absolutely no below-surface knowledge of actual videogames.
The cast is wasted, the gags and concept potential untapped and there's absolutely no subtlety. It sort of seems like a weird joint jungle comedy central roast where everyone is making fun of each other.

I didn't see the need for it and couldn't possibly see it at the same quality and style as the first one. Expectations sank even lower when I found about the cast. And then, 2 years later, I finally watched and, surprise, it's fun. It isn't something that will make you rolling on the floor from laughing or make you cry, but it's an enjoyable ride, actors actually aren't bad and wooden, so you will find yourself grinning a lot, particularly at the male part of the cast, which is awesome, especially Kevin Hart. Watch it with a good friend or a loved one and enjoy. It's not a masterpiece, but it's not just a dumb Hollywood blockbuster either. 8/10",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
169,MovieCriticOnline,So painful to watch..,1,5 March 2018,"It is so cliche and formulated. Every note is so carefully (overly) crafted. You say this and then you say that. Everything feels wooden, inauthentic. The original wasn't great, but fun entertainment and stuck to the book. Each character is a millennia caricature with ""cutesy"" moments they spent months writing. I didn't see one spontaneous moment in the entire film. They took the cast of Breakfast Club and stuck it in Jumanji. And they made sure they got every racial representative in there, not because the original books had it, but because they wanted to get social justice.I feel as annoyed by forced social justice racial diversity, as I would if they remade the Cosby show with Asian, White and Hispanic actors.The acting is just so bad. The mediocrity that people seem to enjoy today is astounding. The movie made ZERO sense, so they made sure they explained it, laying it out in lazy expositions.When you have to explain everything, your writing is poorly done. Show -- don't tell. The CGI was horrible.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
170,Cinemaniac1984,Amazing Fun,8,4 January 2018,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was an amazingly fun movie from start to finish. I honestly thought that it wasn't going to hold a candle to the 1995 classic with Robin Williams and that it was going to crash and burn at the box office. How wrong I was. I had a great time, and there were plenty of laughs. This movie fits perfectly into the modern day era with a lot of updated aspects of the story as well as a completely new cast.The movie starts off with in 1996, when teenager Alex (Mason Guccione) is given the Jumanji board game after his father discovers it on a beach following the events of the previous movie where it was dropped into a river. Alex is originally uninterested with the game however once he finds that it has transformed into a video game cartridge, he starts to play it. Alex then disappears and is never seen again. Fast forward to 2017 where teenagers Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany (Madison Iseman), and Martha (Morgan Turner) are unceremoniously given detention and their principal orders them to clean out a storage area at the school as punishment. Upon discovering the same video game cartridge, the four teenagers start to play the game and find themselves sucked into the world of Jumanji. To their horror, the teenagers find themselves as the four characters they picked to play the game. Spencer is the muscular explorer Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Fridge is the short zoologist Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart), Martha is the lethal commando Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), and Bethany is the overweight cartographer Dr. Shelly Oberon (Jack Black). The four characters are polar opposites to the teenagers. Spencer is a weak willed nerd who is academically clever, Fridge is the tall football jock who shows no interest in school, Bethany is beautiful but very self centered, and Martha is socially awkward. As their four respective characters, they learn from their guide Nigel (Rhys Darby) that to survive the world of Jumanji they must band together to complete the game. They also have to battle the possessed evil explorer Russel Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale).You couldn't have picked a diverse cast with Dwayne Johnson (San Andreas), Jack Black (Tropic Thunder), Kevin Hart (Ride Along) and Karen Gillan (Guardians of the Galaxy). All four are awesome in their respective roles and fit into the movie perfectly. Rhys Darby (Flight of the Concords) does a good job in his small role as the guide Nigel. I still think of Jonathan Hyde's Van Pelt from the original Jumanji movie however Bobby Cannavale (Boardwalk Empire) takes up a different version of Van Pelt in this movie and runs with it.As I said at the start, I didn't have much faith in this movie after being indifferent to Jumanji being resurrected. I didn't think much of the original trailer either. After rewatching the original movie which I have loved since I was 12 years old, I came across the trailer to the new movie and decided to give it a second go. I was completely wrong in thinking that this was going to be a box office failure. I was in absolute surprise to see how fun this movie was going to be. And it was absolutely fun from start to finish.If you liked the original Jumanji, you will not be disappointed. If you haven't seen the original Jumanji, still watch it. If you seek adventure, I guarantee you will have an amazing time. Sit back and have a blast.8/10.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

172,stevenrotherforth,A warm welcome to the jungle,8,3 May 2018,"Jumanji: Welcome to the jungle So I'm probably the only person left in the entire universe that hasn't seen the Robin Williams original version of this movie.
Yes I know ""how can this be?"" you shriek but it's true, so going into this movie I had no expectations. For me this movie had nothing to live up to. Nothing to prove.
On face value I could take this as a stand-alone film and just enjoy it for what it is.
And boy did I enjoy it!
Ok this movie isn't going to win any major awards come Oscar season but still it delivered as a popcorn flick designed to wash over you and pass a couple of hours. 1 hour and 59 mins to be exact.Dwayne Johnson leads a fun and fine cast.
The film tells of a group of teenagers who get sucked into a video game and become the game characters.
They must complete the game without losing all three of their lives if they are to return to the real world and back to their normal teenage selves.In this version the game is a computer game. As the movie rightly points out, kids don't play board games anymore.
Each teenager becomes a video game character with a specific set of skills that will help them progress.
The nerdy wimp becomes the muscular hero as in Johnson but it's Jack Blacks performance that steals the show.
The stuck up selfish popular girl becomes fat middle-aged man.
Black nails his performance to side splitting effect.
The quiet and timid school girl Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse.
Fearless warrior and killer of men. In the game she is played by the gorgeous Karen Gillan
who comically points out that's she's dressed totally inappropriately for survival in the jungle.
A particular scene with Jack Black trying to teach Karen Gillan's reclusive character how to flirt with men is hilarious and highlights both their comedic talent and versatility.
This leads me on to Kevin Harts character. In teenage form he's the giant school jock named Fridge.
In the jungle he becomes... well just Kevin Hart.
Without doubt Hart is very comical but he hardly stretches himself here.
Acting muscles are flexed as Johnson, Black and Gillan mimic their teenage cast counterparts brilliantly.
However Hart just plays himself again.
Whilst he still is supremely funny, I had a hard time accepting his transformation because he acts nothing like the teenage actor he is portraying.
This is a mild gripe as he still had some wonderful moments throughout the movie.Jumanji is a fun time. There's some truly wonderful action set pieces, excellent CGI, hilarious comedy and a plot that rolls along at an enjoyable pace.
This movie doesn't try to be overly long and outstay it's welcome. A perfect Sunday afternoon movie that you can easily watch over and over again.
Kids will love it and there's enough humour and adventure to keep us grown up kids happy too.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
173,joelwatchesmovies,Good action and comedy with mediocre everything else,7,4 January 2019,"The in-video game premise is clever and fun (see the NPCs) but the stakes feel low, despite the limited lives and creepy (crawly) baddie, and the emotional arc is pretty weak too. More importantly though, the adventure-action is good, and the comedy is great (even if it slows down the pace a little too much at points); the four leads excel in their high-school personality roles and bring lots of laughs (Black as the stereotypical popular girl is a highlight, but they all have their moments).

176,jetkot,A Perfect tribute,10,26 December 2017,All Jumanji fans will agree that this movie is a perfect tribute to the original. I was not expecting a good film as most sequels lose the plot and just cash in on the success of the first film. This one was excellent. Dwayne Johnson has definitely come a long way. He looks fantastic and acts really well. Karen Gillan looks seductively hot and acts really well. Her role is brilliant. Kevin Hart and Jack Black give out a genuinely heart warming performance and you leave smiling . They make you laugh plenty of times. Excellent film,Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
177,Mike_Devine,Also missing - the magic & mystery of the original,5,22 July 2018,"22 years after the original jungle-themed, perilous board game unleashed its magic in theaters, we see what happens when the game gets an upgrade as a video game in 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.' This time around, four detention-prone high schoolers stumble upon a retro cartridge gaming system and somehow are transported into the land of Jumanji, where they must lift the curse of a stolen jewel known as the ""eye of the panther"" if they are to have any chance at an escape.Unlike the Robin Williams-starring original, which was a bit more serious than it was silly, the crew here ratchets up the funny factor thanks to the likes of Kevin Hart, Dwayne Johnson and a flamboyant Jack Black (as the young Bethany is stuck in his avatar), while Karen Gillan tries to balance things out as Martha (a.k.a., Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men). Of course, half of the humor comes from the fact that the four teens are caught in bodies that aren't their own - with some of the gags feeling either over the top or severely immature (see Bethany as Black's Dr. Shelly Oberon). There are a few scenes that are worth the cost of admission, namely one that involves pound cake, but overall the movie is a wild ride of laughs that are targeted at adolescent boys and unnecessary casting of Nick Jonas targeted at adolescent girls.What's missing in 'Jumanji' is the magic from the first entry in the series, which was a bonafide action-adventure ride that really sucked you into the game. Sure, this one was a massive hit with audiences, and is spawning a sequel. But it's nothing really special - even the attempts to show there are learnings and lessons of acceptance, bravery and living the one life we have to live come across as being afterthoughts, or at worst, hollow.'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' isn't awful - there are highlights here and there, but it's definitely overrated and a wasted opportunity.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

179,Okonh0wp,Not as scary as the original but that's probably a good thing,8,28 November 2020,"The 90s version of jumanji was meant to be an innocent comedic vehicle for Robin Williams but it was a bit more horrific than family fun when I watched it as a kid. I can honestly say the original gave me nightmares and I can't imagine that happening to the kids who watch the new franchise because there's a care to make sure the fun scenes aren't too fight-inducing. This leads me to believe that the original intent of Jumanji wasn't just as a nightmare-delivery vehicle but had aims for more wholesome entertainment.Like the old version with Robin Williams, this modern version runs the risk of simply being a star vehicle since Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and the Rock are all name brands that consume movies with their own persona. It's a pleasant surprise that the film can maintain an ensemble feel. The film's humor rarely relies on Kevin Hart's stand-up persona or Jack Black's stoner persona. Instead, the two are stretched outside of their muscle memory (Black has been doing this for ages but it's a bigger surprise in a good way Kevin Hart that he can do this) to serve a larger story.The film wisely begins with a breakfast club feel but moves away from it pretty quickly and doesn't necessarily make the characters antagonistic enough towards one another that they would need major walls broken down before them before the game starts. One of the outcasts and popular kids, in fact, used to be friends with one another.The film is full of adventure, camaraderie, and a certain amount of humor. It also has a lot of world-building or internal logic that can make a Summertime blockbuster deep enough to lend itself to multi-layered thinking.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Characters are really annoying and completely cliché. There is the strong guy, the nerd, the hot girl and the wannabe funny guy. I don't understand why ruining an old classic tha made dream when I was a child, rebooting the franchise more than 20 years later.I cannot judge the story, as I did not finish to watch, but the movie does not hook me up. This is just another case of Hollywood trying hard to squeeze an amazing 90s franchise, just to earn as much money as possible. I will try to finish the movie, but this will be painful.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
181,DeBBss,Creative Take On An Interesting Story...,8,25 March 2018,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle takes the story of Jumanji (1995) and makes it modern. Jumanji (1995) was about a board game, and now Jumanji is about a video game, and I think it was a good idea. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was surprisingly good, I have to say. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was going to be cheesy. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle also has a very talented cast, which made the movie so much better, like the Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart duo. I liked how they took a lot of aspects from video games, like how some N.P.C.s repeat themselves in the middle of a conversation. I wished for more video game aspects though, like if they added a glitch or a side quest, then I think that would give much more opportunities for comedy. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle did a lot of things right, like the action and the story, but the antagonist was terrible, the movie didn't really focus on the villain, but more on the situation the protagonists are in. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is more of a human vs nature conflict, rather than a human vs human conflict.Story: 8/10The story was great, in my opinion. The story kept me interested the whole way through the movie. The story is much like a video game, find the objective, collect something, kill the bad guys and eventually reach the end of the game, and they did the video game aspect very well. The story is simple, return the gem to the jaguar statue, and complete the game without losing your three lives, the simple plot makes Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle more entertaining and more enjoyable. I was worried about the subplots, most video games explain the backstory of the main characters', but this movie doesn't focus on that at all, so that was a good decision. There was no pacing issues whatsoever, the movie never felt like it was dragging. I have no issues with the story, but I just wanted more, they could've done better, in my opinion. Overall, the plot was nice and simple, there wasn't too much subplots and the video game aspect was really well done, but they could've done better, by adding more video game aspects.Characters: 7/10The characters were good overall, but the antagonist was very weak and bland. The antagonist didn't really have a strong motive to retrieve the gem, they didn't even explain why the antagonist wanted it in the first place. I feel like if they have done a better job on the villain, then the situation the protagonists' are in could've been more dangerous (making the movie more intense), with the nature also going against them. Even if there was a boss fight at the end, like what's in many other video games, then the antagonist could've been slightly more intimidating. The protagonists were well done. I liked the idea that the teenagers had to accept their new avatars, and learn to be the person they were to scared to be, like how Fridge would have to accept not being tall. All the teenagers were cliches, but it was on purpose, so I'm not going to complain about that. Overall, all of the protagonists were well done, but the villain was poorly done, being bland and just boring.Action: 10/10 In my opinion, one of the best parts about Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was the action. The action was consistent throughout the movie, and I was never bored. I liked how the action scenes were mostly with animals, I thought it was creative, because most movies are human vs human conflicts. The comedy was on point, but some jokes just didn't work for me, but I was impressed how funny this movie was. I think Jack Black and Kevin Hart did most of the comedy, I really hope they do a movie together again. Jumaji: Welcome to the Jungle used a lot of CGI, not only for the animals, but for Jumanji itself. In Jumanji (1995), Alan (Robin Williams character) said Jumanji was a dangerous and scary place, but Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle did the opposite of what I was thinking, but I don't mind it. Overall, the action was on point, constantly entertaining, and the comedy was funny and consistent.Overall, Jumaji: Welcome to the Jungle was a superb action and comedy movie. Once I saw the reviews for Jumaji: Welcome to the Jungle, I instantly had high expectations, and this movie surpassed all of them. The cast was very talented, especially Jack Black playing a teenage girl. The story was simple and basic. The characters were funny and well done, but the antagonist was by far the worst part about this movie. The human vs nature conflict was entertaining and unique. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle had a lot of themes, like to accept who you are and to learn how to cooperate with others. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a movie perfect for kid and adults, even gamers. I recommend Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle to people who likes action, comedy and fantasy movies.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

186,kermitkid,Great for OLDER kids,9,31 March 2020,"Fair warning to parents who want to take their kids to this film: It is NOT for young children. It is PG-13, not PG. And, boy, does it earn that 13. Although the movie is hilarious, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself, a lot of the dialogue is really crass. There are sexual references and profanity throughout the film. I'd say if you were okay with your kid watching the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies, it's about that same level, but I still urge you to use your discretion. I think the idea behind this was ""This is for the kids who grew up with the 1995 original and are adults now so let's make it ""edgy."""" So dumb, and so unnecessary. As for the quality of the actual film, I did enjoy it. I was worried that the jokes would get stale, especially since for the most part they are essentially repeated, but they actually got funnier as the film went on. It took the original premise, set it in modern day, and actually had a pretty good message behind it about loving yourself for who you are and making the most of life. So it's a shame this had to be so crass. What were you thinking, Sony? I thought the film was hilarious in the parts that weren't crass and those really worked, so why couldn't the whole film have been like this? It would have actually been better as a PG. Making something more ""adult"" ironically makes it more ""childish."" There was a parent at my screening who brought their young child to this film and they left halfway through because she got sick of all the inappropriate dialogue and innuendo. (Which I realize is redundant). This felt like a parody of the original, while also honoring the original, (including a mild 5-second shoutout to Robin Williams' character from the original) and had some good action scenes. It's not only a mild parody of adventure games but also the tropes of the characters from those games. (Invincible hero, smart mouthed comic relief, strong female character). It was clever and I can tell the actors had a lot of fun making it. At points, it even felt like a Guardians of the Galaxy film. So, yeah, great, hilarious movie. Just don't take your young kids to it.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
187,ayoreinf,"Lacks the cinematic depth of the original, but makes do all right without it.",8,25 December 2017,"The original Jumanji is one of my all time favorites, of its genre. Mostly because on top of being a very effective kid fantasy movie, it uses cinematic language in a way that calls for very careful viewing. Something I didn't expect, and loved finding. (I always love this sort of a surprise). You won't find this clever usage of cinematic language in this one, but eventually it does make up for ir in a more straight forward manner, while not being any less clever. This one is a very well done movie. Superb acting, even though its often done in an underhanded style or maybe I should use the term subtle in this case. Anyhow, the greatest acting bits aren't obvious or spectacular, but are still there. When Dwayne Johnson ""smolders"", when Jack Black is being Bethany, when Karen Gillan is being Martha. I can't say any more without revealing too much, see the movie - you'll understand what I'm speaking about. Beyond the acting, this one is very carefully crafted to force actual teamwork, not just an instinctive support that was there in abundance in the original movie. In this one the group actually plans its moves repeatedly. I'm not saying there's no instinctive ""light bulb"" moments, but they too come as part of the story - it's a very well written story. The pacing, the editing, the CGI, and all other technical aspects of the movie are well above par. Bottom line - great fun movie with some added value to boot.

188,srdjan_veljkovic,Just enough fun to make it OK,6,5 January 2019,"If you take out the fun and jokes, this is rather uninteresting movie. It blends Jumanji with Tron, but to no interesting effect. The whole game as a movie is not done very well, the ""levels"" don't make much sense and, quite frankly, nobody would play this as a game.The characters are pretty uninteresting and so is their mix, including the gender switch - the hot girl becomes the fat middle-aged guy in the game, which could be interesting, but it's not.But, all of that doesn't really matter, as the crew is funny, know their stuff and the screenplay is there to support them cracking jokes and having fun.Yes, there are several lost opportunities there - Karen Gillan kick-ass scenes could have been more fun. But, only her first (and very short) is, the others are just your run-of-the-mill unrealistic ""hot skinny girl beats up large bad guys"" kung-fu fights.

Jumanji uses several on the nose stereotyping as it focuses on the four main leads, teenagers stuck inside of the video game: Jumanji.If there is one thing that Jumanji deserves to be praised for it is the acting, especially Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black, who perfectly depict this alter ego embodying their physical appearances. It is fascinating and wonderfully fun to see these two act as the two teenage characters that they are 'portraying'. Not to dismiss the fact that the whole cast was wonderful and perfect for the roles that they were in.However at the end of the day, Jumanji was fun, exciting and definitely worthwhile but was extremely predictable and follows many action-comedy beats with its only real innovation being this whole body switching idea that does play into some good laughs.

Now, two decades on, comes a sequel-slash-remake, ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle."" It's a lazy, thoroughly unoriginal bit of storytelling, but it has just enough cheeky humor and bass-thumping action scenes to be a potential crowd-pleaser.In the original, all the mayhem was controlled by the roll of the dice. Now it seems the game has dispensed with any notion of fair play. After gathering dust for decades, it's discovered by another teenager in the 1990s, but this time it gets tossed aside in favor of the latest video game. So it promptly transforms itself into a Nintendo knockoff to kidnap yet another victim.Flash-forward to today, where we meet a quartet of teenage stereotypes out of central casting: two nerds, a jock and a cheerleader who spends her time composing selfies for her Instagram following. After landing in detention together, they stumble on an old console and fire it up, only to find themselves transported to a jungle island and transformed into characters from the game.
Boy nerd gets to marvel at his newfound muscle mass as Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), while girl nerd becomes Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), a scantily clad hottie whose specialties include ""dance fighting.""Meanwhile, the football star loses two feet of height but gains the smart-aleck wit of Kevin Hart as zoologist Moose Finbar. As for our poor cheerleader, she's stuck as Jack Black's ""overweight middle-age man,"" Professor Sheldon Oberon, a true nightmare, at least until she discovers how much easier it is to pee in the jungle with a little extra, um, equipment.And why do video-game characters have bladders to drain in the first place?

Or, you know, any number of bad ones.Basically, the ""Jumanji"" sequel is all motorcycle chases, CGI monsters and sticky comedy, with a few half-hearted efforts at character development and plot twists that will be easily forgotten tomorrow. In other words, it's Hollywood formula at its most generic.

196,FelipeCarrillo,A ductile Sunday follow-up that shatters the pledges raised from its wheedling envelope,6,30 December 2017,"Art is the quality, activity or product executed from the fruit of skills, keeping a core artistic and communicative purpose, an own idea that is materialized through different resources predisposed by humans that ends up influencing what people think and feel, a way of expressing, a way of manifesting. Over the years, the evolution of man has stirred up the emersion of disparate disciplines, always focused on the aesthetic conception overlaid by the time, which were established as Arts, they were officially enumerated by Ricciotto Cuckold in 1911; dance, music and poetry form a reserved list of expressions whose basis is the exhibition of personal thought in response to the events of the world, each of these intervened, of course, by the perceptions and styles of the artist, thus placing originality, imagination and creativity as cardinal tools. Within this prodigious series of acts is the one which, personally, I consider the mother of all arts: cinema, clearly. The Seventh Art, as many call it, is capable of encompassing any of the traditional arts disseminated by human senses, it manages to join movements, narrations, colors and melodies by means of picture and sound. Precisely, an audio-(sound, hearing) visual (vision) experience represents the perfect mold, one in which each individual takes the role of emitter and receiver. From its birth on 28 December 1895 from the hand of the Lumière brothers to my latest showing on 28 December 2018 have passed 123 years of stories, biographies, tales, loves and disappointments, betrayals and loyalties, surprises and speeches; cinematic annals raised by masterpieces, debuts, sequels, trilogies or octologies from different men and women who show intimate insights on millions of screens around the world weekly, creating a range of universes that have written, officially, the highly controversial History of Film. At this point, today, it's revealed the difficulty of each release hitting cinemas to add something fruitfully n brand-new to the Book of Celluloid. More than half of them culminate in either average or deeply deceptive flicks, being only a small minority which gets to take a place, at least, in golden headlines from the best of the year, here, the actor germ: the lack of originality. This problem, sharply commented by this reviewer, affected and continues to affect the creative minds of Hollywood, the cinematic power that being on the brink of the abyss, opts to reuse, literally, proposals from the past, using new faces to get a new audience who shows interest in seeing more of the same, then, Will we get to the point where cinema establishes a unique series of stories on which the thousands of filmmakers work? We pray for no more recycling of ideas.Within the culture broth that has become American cinema, lies adaptation, remake, reboot and continuation; ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" drinks from these four disadvantaged categories. A hybrid that becomes an adaptation of the mythical reference book, a remake of the legacy and mythology of 90's story, a reboot of the time and customs in which the tale develops, a sequel when posing a contemporary plot with a fascinating twist, and even reaches to play with homage in certain fragments that venerate the motion picture from twenty-two years ago. With sufficient controversy and critic, more non-exemplary ideas are cooking up, desperately, with major studios as sponsors, while, quietly and gradually, small indie productions are dedicated to being such small minority.Jake Kasdan directs the flick that means the kick off for a possible needless saga of stories that, according to the grossing at the box office - which are predicted favorable -, will have the chance of arriving in the years to come. Basically, the mythology is preserved, a mythical board game in which every roll of the dice means a drastic change in the real world of the players, however, the variable in the declared sequel reverses the rules, it's founded on the transporting of the players inside the game - now video game cassettes - personified by the sexiest, most hilarious and requested movie stars of today. So far, everything looks interesting and potentially functional, however, this game is missing pieces. The script starts to waver hardly in the introduction of the new batch of actors, some high school boys who fit perfectly in the stereotyped juvenile roles, only, to pour them in the cloned characters of modern cinema. Although the film takes its time presenting the four young protagonists, the spectator never gets good vibes with any of them due to a lousy and clichéd sketch of characters, their attitudes fall into the abhorrent common places and end up in those same places. It's worth highlighting the high level of predictability that the script shows, it's possible to anticipate each move that story is going to execute, besides, adding a poor chemistry and charm between the quartet of the young characters. In the first act, there is a framing in which the four are seated side by side awaiting their punishment, however, there is an empty chair, opening the opportunity to foreshadow the sudden appearance of the character that would become the comic relief, but not, It's just an empty chair until the half the footage, at least, a pinch of subversion. Likewise, we shouldn't expect any kind of identification with the plastic avatars in the jungle-themed game, equally pigeonholed in the roles of strength, intelligence, beauty and stupidity; nor with an antagonist who allows different disgusting insects come out from inside his ears or mouth. Yeah man, the film knows how to build up ephemeral situations in which the vis comica of each one of them pops up, nevertheless, it never touches the same emotional, comical and even sinister dimensions of the feature film directed by Joe Johnston, where we watched a newcomer Kirsten Dunst along with the acting master Robin Williams. It's indisputable that thanks to the busiest and most popular cast, led by the always hilarious Jack Black, the story remains standing and manages to stretch a dynamic and kinetic pace as much as possible, however, it does by an odious predictability and some visual landscapes that don't exploit the huge possibilities that they held in their hands, even though most of the locations are real places (Hawaii) and its special medium-level digital effects. As is customary in these types of proposals, the film is as chaotic as the situations it exhibits due to traditional symptoms, that are hidden behind all the creative process. The first and main trigger is the number of screenwriters, four writers proposing and laughing at an executive table while they prepare a cocktail of dramatic and sidesplitting moments as unequally functional as necessarily witty. Chris McKenna, the man behind ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" and ""The LEGO Batman Movie"" - two of the superhero jewels of the year - was responsible for writing the global story, but apparently, it seems to have left all his powerful ideas in his previous works. Leaning ingeniously and respectfully on the world of video games, the central plot follows a traditional structure and doesn't provide eminent strangeness that should be the salvation key for this kind of movies, those that set up its stories more in the humor of the situations than in the humor of tale as such. As a strong point, a cunning, subtle play around the video-game-themed background, the screenwriters gave with an ingenious magical formula to overturn the storylines or the different settings of newfangled video game consoles with, of course, a narrative and parody purpose, however, many of these situations work well, even though the film is riddled with them.Jake Kasdan's ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" brings together three of the funniest movie stars of the moment, one ""Doctor Who"" Scottish actress and one former member of the American pop-rock band Jonas Brothers to deliver a free-entertainment film with the exact doses of nostalgia and new content, devoid of any drop of true originality, but brimming with one-liners and comical moments that follows the proper procedures of the typical mega-studio productions in the genre. A funny follow-up to close a year of surprising cinema of just quality, therefore, simply stays in that way, in a correct and admissible time killer, not something really substantial. One more play in the lucrative game called Hollywood. A game, just that.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

198,drunken_munki,"Great movie, funny, and well made",8,19 October 2021,"They took the interesting idea from the 1995 movie, and made it better.The characters are first and foremost the main reason why this is enjoyable and why the film works as a jungle adventure. The four teens are taken out of their world and dropped into the Jungle as recreated in the form of a video game simulation. The Jumanji game box updated itself, presumably with the same magic that allows it to create a world of its own.The actors did a lot here to play as the 'game' characters as if played by the younger cast. The nesting of characters inside characters was very clever and allows some real exploration of the young characters and the predicaments of being stuck in the game.The visuals are excellent, the action is paced out well and the plot is unravelled as a simple action adventure, but with the character work between everything it is very entertaining. Also very funny, a lot of the material is delivered excellently and this had a lot of very funny moments.I can't speak to the older film, it was one I watched as a kid. Anyway, this is a clever rework of the material and I think they did an excellent job. Something that a lot of modern movies lack is 'soul', but I have to say this film has it in spades.

201,Jared_Andrews,This Movie is Pure Fun!,7,23 January 2018,"The steady and impressive box office success is well-deserved. This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018.  No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting.  Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. ""Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!"" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much. Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.
 
Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch). Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car ""why can't you just drive us where we need to go?"" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is. Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with ""I'm just saying you're a babe."" Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short. These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Their appearances are also changed into the video game characters.This is really a very cool movie. I love everything about it. The characters are realistic and have great development.

204,JaydoDre,Strong middle part,7,2 July 2018,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle has a strong middle part, which is the part where the characters really start interacting with one another and start working off of the good chemistry between them. The writing is mostly good and the actors are good, though this movie is really a Jack Black show. The guy completely steals the show, playing a superficial girl stuck inside a guy's body, which may be a little too silly to some.The action sequences and the physics throughout the movie do not make a whole lot of sense, but the movie of course always has the excuse that the whole thing is a game and is not supposed to make too much sense.The weak parts of the film are the beginning and the end, but especially the beginning, where the movie rushes through the introductions without any impact, in order to get to the main part as fast as possible. If you are watching the movie with other people, it may be easy to get distracted and talk during the very beginning and thus miss a few things.This movie is unlikely to occupy your mind long after you have seen it, but it is still a lot of fun.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

I hadn't planned on watching it as it looked ridiculous, but I must say it was actually fun. The wife and I had a blast watching the movie.Following in the footsteps of the original Jumanji, a group of teenagers get stuck in the Jumanji world after playing the game. This time around to add a modern spin they get stuck in a video game world with multiple lives and all. The humor of the movie, while by no means smart was a lot of fun. It did throw a round some juvenile sex jokes and a repetition of a few comedy tropes but otherwise I found myself laughing quite a bit. They did a good job utilizing the video game concept to incorporate character skills and to add more humor with the concept of dying frequently. Without spoiling anything one of the funniest scenes involves a character's weakness to cake and explosions. Utterly ridiculous but fun.Acting wise the movie isn't going to win any awards, but I thoroughly enjoyed the character interactions. Who doesn't love The Rock, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black. All three had great back-and-forth interactions with each other.The movie was a nice mix of comedy, action, an over-the-top ridiculous.

208,RhapsodyReviews,Hilariously Fun.,8,27 December 2019,"Review:
'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is an adventure-comedy film directed by Jake Kasdan. It is the third installment of the 'Jumanji' franchise, after 'Zathura: A Space Adventure' (2005) and a direct sequel to 'Jumanji' (1995), which was based on the children's book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg.
This is a fun, hilarious adventure family film, what more can you ask for? The chemistry between all the actors are on point, bringing a fun adventure film to life.
Set twenty-one years after Jumanji, it follows four teenagers who are transported into the video game world of Jumanji and play as their chosen characters. Joining another player, they must beat the game to return home.
Every character in the video games world was played to perfection. Dwayne Johnson basically retires his wrestling persona for this film and instead, provides a smoldering and intense performance, riddled with good-natured hilarity as the lead in this film. Kevin Hart was great as the sidekick, I think he was involved in every funny moment in which I laughed the hardest. Karen Gillan was perfect as the badass who was played by a shy teenage girl. Finally, the master of the whole film, Jack Black plays the teen beauty queen with 100% commitment and to perfection.
The jokes are nonstop and witty. Characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of Jumanji. A little homage is paid to Alan Parrish throughout the movie, which I liked, and the movie continues, 20 years after the events of 1996.
Overall, it's a nearly perfect family comedy that rises above lowest common denominator humor.

211,achyutaghosh,Hit and Miss,7,3 January 2018,"Braveheart, Seven, Heat, Die Hard, Goldeneye, Toy Story, 12 Monkeys, Bad Boys, Desperado, Ace Ventura, Mortal Combat, Judge Dredd, Waterworld, Babe, Apollo 13- whew, what a year 1995 was in Hollywood. My favorite though in that year was the Robin William classic, Jumanji. A fantasy adventure based on the 1981 children's book, it featured a board game with a magical twist, along with a typically endearing performance by Robin Williams. Targeting the Christmas holiday crowd, and with rhinos thundering down the streets, it made tons of money, even with relatively rudimentary visual effects. Given the state of VFX today, and the solid demand for good family fun in December, I was surprised that a sequel for Jumanji was not attempted all these years. Oh wait, there was Zathura: A Space Adventure in 2005. Right.Circa Christmas 2017, and we finally have a sequel starring everyone's favorite eyebrow. Set 21 years after the original movie, the premise is slightly different this time. 4 teenagers get sucked into the jungle world of Jumanji, and they need to play as game characters and win to return back home. Sounds simple? Director Jake Kasdan livens things up by getting the teenagers to play avatars that are opposites of the real life characters. So nerdy Spencer Gilpin becomes the heroic Smolder Bravestone played by Dwayne Johnson, jock Fridge becomes wimpy sidekick Franklin Finbar played by Kevin Hart, shy Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse (played by Karen Gillan) who is basically a Lara Croft rip-off, and popular college babe Bethany transforms into overweight cartographer Sheldon Oberon (Jack Black). Throw in hippos, rhinos, elephants, jaguars, and snakes into the mix and bingo you can justify the title. There is of course a villain in the mix, but it is kind of immaterial. This is a family movie, releasing in Christmas, of people playing video game characters, so we all know how it goes.In short, nothing exceptionally original- it is Breakfast Club + 13 going to 30 + Indiana Jones + Jack Black Speaking of Jack Black, he is hilarious as a teenage girl, and we all know that Johnson and Kevin Hart have awesome chemistry- watch Central Intelligence for an even better showcase. The movie is fast paced, the script is funny, the special effects are as good as it gets, but the story lacks imagination, and the characters are way under-developed. True the kids learn something about life by playing different avatars, but that's about it. I kept going back to the original, and by god that was a classic! The game coming into our lives is certainly more interesting than us in a game.Having said that Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a good one time watch. It is innocent, family fun, and that is what the season demands actually.
7/10",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
212,n-kefala,Jumanji is back!,7,7 January 2018,"""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is a light-hearted, easy-to-watch action/comedy, that strikes the balance between referencing its nostalgic origins without being obnoxious. Also with a different take on the coming-of-age story, and a good dynamic between the five main actors. Mostly great fun, with Jack Black outrageously entertaining and Dwayne Johnson who is sweetly funny as the muscular incarnation of a nerd.
Like a video game, the narrative lacks any character development, relying on chases and the fear of death. But all-in-all, the rebooted version of ""Jumanji"" remains a fun-family film to watch over the year and I think without a doubt, will bring more productions as soon as possible.

217,AnishMisra,Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle Review,8,2 August 2018,"Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle is a film directed by Jake Kasdan. I am not particularly a fan of the 1995 film but I would still say that I had a good time watching the film. The announcement of this film quite astonished me and the trailers for the film seemed OK. I was actually surprised as to how much I liked the film.Plot: Spencer, Martha, Bethany and Anthony are all sucked into the video game Jumanji where their only way to survive is to finish the game.Story and direction: Sony is mostly famous for taking something that is famous and turning it so commercial that the profit is earned but the quality is very bad. But this film understands that it has to deliver, quality wise. I wouldn't say the story has groundbreaking elements or things that we haven't seen before, but the film manages to entertain. I liked the way we have troubled characters that are sucked into one situation and their only way out is if they work with one another. Also very nicely incorporated is the video game aspect of Jumanji. WE have a life bar, character strengths and weaknesses, non player characters, exposition that helps us understand what the game is. This entire world of Jumanji seems very much believable (because of it being a video game world). The action sequences were good and nicely done. However, there were one or two places where horrible VFX (or green screen) has been used to execute the action sequences. The score by Henry Jackman also adapts to the situation and adds something refreshing to the film. My other problem with the film is that certain scenes are not explained very properly. They seemed to have just let that go for the sake of it. Performances: Dwayne Johnson is good what he does. Kevin Hart did add his touch of comedy to the film. Karen Gillian's character was different and I liked it. I didn't understand the casting of Nick Jonas since he wasn't acting at all. Jack Black was the surprise package. I know he is good, but in here he is the highlight of the film. Rhys Darby, Rohan Chand and Bobby Cannavale did provide good supporting roles. Even the teenagers in the real world delivered compelling performances.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Bethany (in Sheldon Oberon's body) teaches Martha (in Ruby Roundhouse's body) how to flirt with someone. I can seriously say that I laughed so hard in the scene because of its awkwardness and absurdity.Verdict: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is a good follow-up to the 1995 film. I was highly entertained by the film and had a very good time. I don't know what the sequel in 2019 will consist of as no room was left for a third instalment.I am going with an 8/10.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

When the other kids come across it, it's a console.make no mistake the first 15-20 minutes of this drag like hell. once they're in the game however it's a 180. I totally buy that they are avatars of those same teens. the ""game"" is very straight forward and easy to grasp from the get go with the movie being more about the character's development then anything else. They started off paper thin but the movie played it up nicely, the visuals were fun and... I can't believe I'm saying this but Jack Black was actually funny in this!There is a tie in with the original but it's subtle and I liked how the ending was faithful to how the original ended. This was fun movie for the family. it started at ground zero but made you care about the characters and get invested in it as it went on. 8.5 stars and a recommendation from me.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
221,thepriceofpayne,Welcome to the JUNGLE,7,16 December 2019,"""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is actually a welcome surprise from a studio who's had some franchise issues recently. The film works as a semi-sequel, homage, and reboot of the Robin Williams classic, and successfully makes an entertaining adventure featuring wonderful performances from Karen Gillian, Dwayne Johnson, the scene stealing Jack Black, and Kevin Hart (despite the fact he's playing himself). This film is a fun and exciting Jungle adventure that will give you just the right amount of nostalgia while also creating something new and inviting, even if the writing can be standard at times.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
222,dfloro,Better than probably should be...,6,24 June 2021,"I wasn't a fan of the Jumanji movie starring Robin Williams, so how huge were the odds against me liking this remake? Well, I do kinda like it. And I can sum up why in two words: no, not ""The Rock"" (and certainly not ""Kevin Hart,"" who will forever remain an embarrassment). The two words are ""Jack"" and ""Black""! The main comedic premise of the movie is that all the main characters are now inhabiting bodies kinda the opposite of IRL. So Rock is really a scrawny, nerdy scaredy-cat, Kevin Hart is really a huge high school football hero whose nickname is ""The Fridge"" (call-back to the late William 'The Refrigerator' Perry), and the always plump and lovable Jack Black ""In Real Life"" is a blonde high school cheerleader named Bethany. And is he EVER. He's so goofy, it's easy to forget how good an actor he can be (strictly when he chooses to, of course). The best section for me is when Jack-as-cheerleader is giving the nerdy girl, who is now both hot-looking and a total bad-ass, tips to distract a couple of male guards with her ""feminine wiles,"" then the girl promptly forgets all the teachings and realizes she's still no cheerleader herself, but she *IS* one, real certifiable bad-ass! Talk about women's empowerment: the two characters that I just described both have got it going ON! Anyway, the plot's totally absurd, of course, but The Rock manages to channel his inner nerd-dom, and Jack Black rocks the (popular-girl) casbah. 6/10 because, well, why not? 😉",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

It has some charismatic performances in all of the main characters, although Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart definitely take the cake. But besides some of the natural charisma of the actors, I found most of the jokes to be very hit or miss, the script bland and the special effects weren't even that good. The script is mainly a way to get from point A to point B and the things that happen in the middle are kind of predictable and boring. Also, the movie could have easily been 20 minutes or so shorter.

Even it wasn't so big box office magnet it has still become a movie classic. Maybe that is a reason who we were have to wait the sequel so long. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is not exactly a sequel even it start where last movie ended. More it is a original story, not re-filming. Because the original movie is such a classic this could be a catastrophic. It is good to see, that it isn't. Even this is not something big movie history, it is still quite enjoyable adventure movie. Script is quite stupid, but has enough of strengths to hold the story together. It is very solid two hour movie experience and timing is strict enough to to keep you oriented. Great effects combined with good storytelling is satisfying enough. Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black are fun to watch. Well timing action with great effects makes this movie quite enjoyable to watch.

229,joshbarton15,A thoroughly entertaining evolution,8,9 December 2017,"Jumanji is a film I grew up with so it'll always hold a place in my heart. It's by no means the greatest film ever made but it is a film I never thought would need a sequel, the very idea being a product of the lazy Hollywood cycle. To do a sequel to Jumanji, you have to be brave enough to evolve the franchise and not just rehash it all, which is exactly what they did with Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.When four teenagers get sucked into the video game Jumanji, they become their chosen avatars; Dr Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black), Franklin Finbar (Kevin Hart) and Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan). Together they must play along and finish the game to stand any chance of getting back home.The evolution of Jumanji from board game to video game is one of the sensible ways that the creative team bring us a sequel two decades after the original was released. It's the only way the kids of today would ever play it so to see the game itself change to attract new players makes sense. The idea of a sequel after all this time is one that left me skeptical however, thanks to a changed concept of the story taking place inside the game rather than the game coming to the real world, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle quickly became a sequel to become interested in.The changed concept is one that leads to a good old-fashioned adventure romp full of action and plenty of fun for the entire family. The idea of the kids being sucked into the game and being forced to play it out as characters totally opposite to their everyday selves makes for an amusing watch, the raucous laughter from the audience being a telling sign.No one is having more fun here than the four leads of the film mind. Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan all make Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle such great entertainment; Johnson milking it while playing a nerd trapped inside the body fit for an action movie star, Hart revelling in the big guy trapped in a small guy's body role, Black stealing the film as the Instagram obsessed girl playing as an overweight professor, a role he seems so suited for, and Gillan bringing the fierceness when she needs to as Ruby Roundhouse a.k.a. the ""Killer of Men"" which, as you've guessed, is so far away from her character back in the real world. You get a sense that working on this set would have been so much fun.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle works as a continuation of the Jumanji franchise, even if there are people out there who are adamant it won't. It's the perfect kind of film to take the family along to and I can guarantee fun will be had all round. It was much better than I was expecting and I'm ready to call it the biggest surprise of the year.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Ever since Dwayne Johnson started his acting/movie star career I was and still am impressed that despite my expectation of 'massive ego' to emanate, he appears to be taking his acting lessons as seriously as he can with little apparent fear of making fun of himself.

The group dynamics are excellent, and they all have hilarious back-and-forths with each other. Some of my favorite moments in the movie are when everyone is simply standing around talking. Dwayne Johnson really shows his comedic talents here. While he does have a few scenes where he gets to show off his action chops, most of his role is comedy-heavy, and he delivers on it. Kevin Hart plays the same character he always plays, and more times than not it annoys me, but for whatever reason here it works. Maybe it's his chemistry with the other actors, but he's hysterical in this movie. I'm not a huge fan of Karen Gillan's character of Nebula in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, so I wasn't sure how she was going to be in this. But she delivers as well. Not only does she nail the action beats (and she has some of the best in the whole movie), but she also has some great comedic moments, comedy that I didn't know she could pull off as well as she did. But the true star of this movie is Jack Black. I thought he was hysterical in the trailer, but I was afraid that the concept of him actually being a teenage girl would get old and annoying quick, but it doesn't.

237,pal05052003,Hilarious fun escapism,8,19 December 2017,"Jumanji 2 is a hilarious, fun, escapist, adventure movie starring The Rock, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart. Using video game rules, the movie truly brings video game magic to the screen, and subtly pokes fun at the action genre. The Rock is great as usual and has a literally huge presence in the movie. The chemistry among the cast is great, and the Rock proves once again he is the go to guy if Hollywood wants to revitalize a franchise, though he has yet to prove he can fuel an actual franchise by himself. As for Jack Black and Kevin Hart, both provide great comedy to an already comical The Rock. However, Kevin Hart's character is more interesting than Black's and therefore wins the crown for best comical character in the movie. Karen Gillan is stunning, and kicks ass, though she is not given much else to do. The movie has great sweeping shots, and over the top action, but all of this makes the movie plausible, given the premise that the characters are trapped in a game world.

243,tmpsvita,Un unconvincing and not so entertaining sequel,5,20 January 2018,"Probably it's because I'm not particularly fond of the original with Robin Williams, but I knew from the first trailer that I wouldn't like this reboot/sequel,
certainly the reviews and the unexpected success at the box office had convinced me to give him a chance, so that in the end I joined the wide audience who decided to go and see it at the cinema, during the holiday season.
Well I must say that the first part was also convincing me of the opposite, with a good start, the pleasant lines, often zany and some of which citationists and referienzal (types of jokes that I prefer), pretty action scenes and functional gags , thanks for the most part to the discreet interpretations of the protagonists.
But all this refers only to a promising first part, let's say the first forty minutes of film, because after them the film begins to collapse like a house of cards on a windy day.
The causes are many but the main ones are a screenplay that with the going of the minutes becomes more and more tired and weak, characters to which you are not attached ever despite the attempts of the actors that between voices, visual expressions over the lines, and frantic and exaggerated stunt, try in every way possible to save the film in vain (apparently for many, however, worked), but at least they make up most of the merits of the film, especially Jack Black.
In addition in the film is missing a real villan, the film tries to characterize two, the island itself with its various challenges, and Van Pelt (interpreted trivially by Bobby Cannavale), but neither is sufficiently developed or exploited as it should , especially the second that ends up being useless to say the least.
Towards the end the film proves to be a continuous repetition of jokes and gags, one similar to the other, but less brilliant, less citationist, less amusing, the same is true for the various sequences of action that follow each other without any connection as if they were simple steps and, if for a video game this is fine, for a film is not so, making it simply not fun, not very engaging but quite boring and repetitive.
Too bad because some good ideas are there but most of them are not developed at all, or superficially developed, so in the end what could be a good comedy action movie that paid homage to the original Jumanji and to the world of videogames in a self-ironic, idiotic (but cleverly) and original way has turned into a flat, tasteless, anonymous and, I repeat, boring Blockbuster.
However, I am glad that most of the audience this new ""Jumanji"" liked, I hope in a second vision, maybe in Blu Ray and in the original language (here in Italy in the cinema the movies are dubbed in our language), that manages to convince me.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

I appreciate the Director of Casting who can search the faces of all actors similar to the faces of game characters, this is miraculous.The only weakness that I found in Jumanji 2017 movie is that the core story itself: how can people get into the game. This is super imaginative and that part also makes us curious about the game business with the question of such: ""can we really doing game like in reality?"" and if yes, ""could we comeback?""

This movie is miles better than the original but it's still a mix between being average and just plain bad. All humour comes from dick jokes and screaming and swearing and whilst it does get some decent chuckles from the NPC interactions it isn't enough to carry a comedy/adventure movie. Also, it's way too cheesy. I don't go to see a movie rated PG 12 for cheesy heartfelt lessons. Lessons in movies shouldn't be taught like this. Why not make it endearing instead of forced? Is it really that hard? Disney has been able to pull off endearing and meaningful messages for decades so why has no one been able to master it yet? The only actor I could tolerate was Dwayne Johnson as he seemed to actually pull off a decent performance instead of just screaming and being obnoxious like Kevin Hart in this movie.

Four teenagers in detention stumble across a video game called Jumanji and decide to play it. Upon starting the game, they are sucked in and discover that the only way to get back to the real world is by finishing the game.
A brilliantly written, well-executed movie. When I watched this, some of it reminded me of Raiders of the Lost Ark and it turns out that it was directed by the son of the guy who wrote the screenplay for Raiders! And he does an excellent, excellent job.
Dwayne Johnson is so darn hilarious in this movie! He is playing a scared-of-everything, ill-confident, awkward teenager stuck in a muscly action hero/leader avatar and he does it sooo well! The character is so polar opposite to every other role I've seen Johnson in that I wouldn't have believed that Johnson could do it if I didn't watch it for myself. He is utterly convinces you that he really is a skinny awkward teenager stuck in a handsome muscular avatar (no, I don't have a crush of him). The role is both for and against Johnson. I was laughing so much watching Johnson in this role. He's the only one who could do his character as well as he does.

253,feyipuk,Packed full of stereotypes and paint by numbers script,6,17 September 2018,"We're living in a era of directors and studio execs who saw films twenty years ago and are now in the positions to remake them with their own spin. If you're going to base a film on a classic, then don't just cherry pick the bits you like and throw the rest away!The clever bit about the original - and Chris Van Allsburgs other board game based film; Zathura - was that the action took place in the real world, and how the game would interact with the players actual lives; stampede down main street, big game hunter chasing you, monsoon in the hall. Here, as technology has evolved, so the action takes place inside a computer, yet the game play itself seems to have devolved as the graphics have improved. The NPC's (Non-Player Characters) are supposedly just programmed to interact with the players in a certain way, no matter what they do. The evil game hunter Van Pelt of the original film has been replaced with a two dimensional Professor Russell Van Pelt, who has been given so much power in the game, it would seem unlikely they could survive if he had the same intelligence as his namesake.It's lucky then that the film is more about the relationships between the main characters than actual peril. Alex Wolff/Dwayne Johnson is Spencer, a stereotypical nerd, who plays video games, is awkward around people and rarely gets into trouble. Ser'Darius Blain/Kevin Hart is Fridge; six foot tall footballer, who needs his friend - despite having been pushing him away - of seven years to do his homework so he can keep on playing. Morgan Turner/Karen Gillan is Martha; a smart but shy wallflower with a self image issue. And Madison Iseman/Jack Black is Bethany; a socially obsessed, shallow girl, who can't live without her phone. And in the game, they basically have to face their insecurities; the nerd becomes confident (and strong), the jock becomes smart (and weak), the wall flower becomes an extrovert and the popular girl becomes Jack Black!This last one is a role Black was born to play; a woman trapped in a mans body. Able to play it as effeminately as he wants, make lots of penis jokes and be self-deprecating about his appearance. You knew that as soon as Bethany was out the game she'd make a comment about how glad she was to be in her body.Just like Fridge moans about being the diminutive Hart, Spencer admiring his muscles and Martha questioning her wardrobe choices. All things you'd question if you found yourself in a polar opposite situation and had to adapt.The CGI and film locations are - as expected in the modern era - great, though this seems wrong, given the rudimentary level of the NPC's. They could have had something badly rendered or other throwback to the vintage of the game.It's a good premise, with a strong take away message for the kids, just wish they'd played with the video game premise a little bit more.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

256,WooderIce64,A Surprise Hit,8,6 January 2019,"This was perhaps the most surprising movie of 2017, especially in terms of box office. The whole idea of a movie poking fun at the tropes, clichés, and stereotypes of video games seems like the type of humor that would get old quickly, and the fact that it came out the week after Last Jedi made it seem like they weren't expecting a financial success. But lo and behold, it won 4 weekends at the box office and grossed $400,000,000 in the U.S alone. Given that popular franchises have been dominating the box office lately, it was nice to see something so original. Granted, it is a sequel, but it doesn't have many connections to the 1995 movie. It really is much more of a standalone work. It immerses itself in its own world and doesn't connect very much to the original Jumanji. It doesn't feel like a sequel to anything.It features the talents of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, and Jack Black. What's so great about these characters are how well they act like the kids who are controlling them. At the beginning, the kids fall into the stereotype zone: the nerd, the jock, the valley girl, and the shy girl. Despite that, the way they interact with each other in their in-game avatars makes up for it and makes them fully fledged characters as opposed to just generic tropes. Most of the humor is stemmed from the idea of someone being in the body and role of someone completely different from them, which is why it works. It's really just classic role-reversal. As for the story, though, it's kind of generic. They need to find this mystical gem and bring it to a jaguar statue before some generic bad guy does. But it's the story isn't really the appeal of this movie, it's about the characters. The jungle looks nice, which is an added bonus.Another thing this movie does very well is how well it represents the video game aspect. You don't need to be a gamer to understand or enjoy this. Anything that general audiences wouldn't understand is simply explained, meaning that anyone can enjoy this. Also, the idea of the NPCs just repeating lines of dialogue to the Rock was very accurate to the idea of a real RPG, making it seem like Jumanji could very well have been a game from back in the day.This is a movie that's on the verge between ""guilty pleasure"" and ""legitimately good."" I'd say it's the latter, although it does have elements of the former. It knows exactly what it is and does a very good job at it; it's just a fun comedy about teenagers taking on a new set of roles and forming new bonds as a result. It's fun, it's satisfying, and there's really nothing more to it.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
257,arod_85,Surprisingly good and dare I say better than the original...,8,7 January 2018,"My family and I went to watch this movie because there was nothing else we could see as a family in the theater. The previews did not look appealing to me at all so I wasn't expected much going in. But it turned out to be so much better than I expected after being underwhelmed by movies I had much anticipated to see like Pitch Perfect 3 and even Starwars. My family loved this movie! I grew up with the original and Ioved Robin Williams, but do have to admit I found this one so much funnier, more engaging, and to have a better story line.

The story doesn't have as much intensity or dark undertone of the original. Backstories about teenage angst replace the sad tragedies of the first movie. The film definitely suffers from comparisons to the original. Taken on it's own it's not spectacular, but it is entertaining, in some ways the movie even comes across as a deconstruction of video games. Worth the watch",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
259,Kirollos-Noah,Very fun and thrilling!,8,29 September 2018,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is directed by Jake Kasdan, written by Chris McKenna and staring Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black and Kevin Hart.Story by Chris McKenna, and it's about four high-school kids discover an old video game console with a game they've never heard of--Jumanji--they are immediately drawn into the game's jungle setting, literally becoming the avatars they chose: gamer Spencer becomes a brawny adventurer (Dwayne Johnson); football jock Fridge loses (in his words) ""the top two feet of his body"" and becomes an Einstein (Kevin Hart); popular girl Bethany becomes a middle-aged male professor (Jack Black); and wallflower Martha becomes a badass warrior (Karen Gillan). What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji--you must survive it. To beat the game and return to the real world, they'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, discover what Alan Parrish left 20 years ago, and change the way they think about themselves--or they'll be stuck in the game forever...I liked this movie so much, it's unique and better than the first Jumanji, but Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle isn't a sequel, it stands on it's own.Anyways, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is full of action sequences which were very good, very talented performances in the world of Jumanji, but in the real life, the performances were bad, and it takes to another thing I hated about this movie, I didn't see so much of Jumanji or lots of animals as I expected to see. The CGI of the animals wasn't that good anyway. The story is really good, I loved every sequence of this movie, it's like video game but a movie, I loved it! The sense of humor of this movie is really funny, I liked that , but Kevin Hart with Dwayne Johnson scene was so Central Intelligence, I didn't that, but I laughed though.I liked Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle very much and I'm gonna give it a B+.Thank you, guys as always for reading my review, I hope you liked it, and I welcome all of your comments.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

We get some nice range from Dwayne Johnson. Karen Gillan is fun but doesn't really seem to remember at times what it was like to be a teen girl. Kevin Hart pretty much is Kevin Hart but it's good fun. The kids do a great job as well.All the characters have some growth except the character of Fridge who really isn't a good person and never seems to realize that he's been a crappy human being for years.The best chemistry is between Karen Gillan and Jack Black.

I don't think it's the best option but it's jokes usually land and the action scenes are fun. I think the general storyline is kind of weak and some of the jokes aren't that good, also it's pretty predictable and the main characters are a little annoying.

Characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of Jumanji. A little homage is paid to Alan Parrish at the beginning of the movie, and the movie continues, 20 years after the events of 1996.The Rock is always fun, but shines as a scared nerd with no confidence. Karen Gillan is adorable as the socially awkward nerdy girl. Jack Black playing a self obsessed popular girl is laugh out loud funny. Kevin Hart as a shrunken jock with many assigned weaknesses is classic. All in all a nearly perfect family comedy that rises above lowest common denominator humor. Worth the trip to see it on the big screen. You do not have to see the original to appreciate it. Not quite 10 stars because adult re-watch value is just not there.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

But either don't make me laugh. Humor that's human, that's what makes me laugh.A kid disappears into Jumanji, never to be heard of again after his father while jogging along the beach found the original game, which the kid didn't like because it was a board game, which makes it change into a videogame overnight, which catches his attention and he plays it and #goto the beginning of sentence. That's during 1990s. His father's life goes to ruins and their house becomes the freak house that looks like it's haunted, but the father, now a lost soul, still lives there.Twenty years later, a couple of kids earn themselves detention. A jock, once friend to the smart kid that fails to fake a different voice while writing the jock's essay. The smart kid without a sense of reality and obviously not a fiction writer. The girl that feels that everything is awkward and that has a natural attraction thing for the not-so-smart smart kid. And the girl totally obsessed with her phone, her appearance, and the way she thinks people see her.All of the video game characters whose avatars the kids ended up in really focused on counteracting the kids' perceptions of what they are and what they need to be. They feel they become everything they should or shouldn't be to be cool and then they die, come falling out of the sky with still a couple of lives left, crash through a roof, to resume their place in the game and have another go at it before they run out all of their lives. But first, they realize it hurts like a bitch and cry like a baby girl. I'm sorry, but that just made me laugh. And it wasn't the only time.It's only natural for kids playing video games to pick the character that's opposite to what they perceive themselves to be or to mistakenly get sucked into a character like that. The screenwriter throughout the movie comes off as a really funny and smart person that really understands the business of screenwriting, and anyone less knowledgeable would assume this is the case, but I, as the kind of person that played some videogames and coincidentally played the scrawny little thief with fascinating magic skills, immediately understood that the writing only by accident became this funny. There's no way the screenwriter, actors, or director could have on purpose made it this naturally funny.It's a movie that's clearly funny, exciting, and heartwarming by accident with everything falling into place perfectly. There's no way anyone did a great job on purpose. So just watch it by accident. Enjoy.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
270,hiraishinnojutsu,"A boring mediocre adventure movie filled by unnecessary joke and drama, along with bad cgi moments",6,21 December 2017,"Start with a slow pace, this move gave me the same movie experience when I watched Geostorm (2017): it's so boring, that in the middle of it, I just want this movie to just skip to end credits already. even when I saw the trailer, the movie just wasn't too promising, and man, I've never been feeling so wrong when I decided to just give it a go despite the former reason. the first Jumanji movie (1995), though not a masterpiece, was at least likeable to the point that it became almost the entire today's twenty-something's childhood. This movie almost do nothing but insult that beautiful legacy by just existing as a sequel no one even asked before (almost like the female version of Ghostbusters did (2016) to the original Ghostbusters (1984), and thank god I didn't watch the former on the theater, otherwise I just banged my head to the hardest and the thickest wall many times until I felt I had unwatched it). Sure the jokes make everyone laughs (and I hate to admit that I laughed few times too), but not all the jokes are the good jokes worth laughing out loud for. I'm pretty sure some of the viewers decided to use a cringe expression to some of the jokes, especially the ones that included male's vital organ as the laughing material. The action scenes were not good either, I mean, to the overall scenes, it feels like they were sinking very deep in the bottom of the ocean in the middle of a vast sea of talking, jokes, drama, and any other kind of unimportant moments. some of the moments with the cgi (and the plot) makes me think this movie should have been made into a tv series instead of a 2-hour long movie that ends up as a one of the year's worst movie ever set foot on the big screen (though I don't think many people would like it either). so, in short, all I was saying can be put in this one sentence: not even the comedy trio Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson-Kevin Hart-Jack Black can make this movie interesting to watch from beginning to end.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Don't doubt me when I say this movie is worth the 2 hours and the money spent. It is nothing like the original, so don't expect that. But I will say I like it better than the original, which is hard to do these days. Jack Black nailed his character of a teenage, social-media-driven girl and had me laughing with almost every word he spoke. The rest of the cast added their humour as well which just made it an amazingly funny movie overall.

279,kuuk3,The film is exactly what you expect.,7,8 December 2017,"Saw via an early Unlimited Screening. Its no Oscar contender, but for a comedy adventure family film; it fulfils its purpose. None of the heroes use guns, although they do snap necks. They also show several deaths with blood splatter. So not for the squeamish. There are also scenes of bugs entering ears which can be off-putting.The teenage high school drama and love story is cheesy, as is the school bully / loner story arc. Its nothing we have not seen before. But it sets up the character traits and once were in the Jungle, it gets a lot better. It feels a little short, and some scenes like the Transporter Hanger was suppose to hard, but the lack of bad guys didn't make much sense. Every scene appeared to have been written to serve each characters death in turn. From eating cake to walking alongside a cliff. Trying to keep track of who had how many lives left let you predict who was going to die next. But it was at least trying to show character growth with each plot point and establish how these people change which is something I suppose. Removing the staples from magazines before recycling was nonsense. But that's the level of thought that had gone into the writing process. But again, its not trying to win any Oscars and is up against Star Wars in the cinema (whose stupid idea was that?) so I doubt its going to beat it at the box office. But once were in the game, its a fun, adventure film with four strong comedic actors doing what they do best.

""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" doesn't have the same charm as its predecessor, but it is a fun adaptation to the modern world.Packed with a great cast, ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"", not to be confused with the Rock's earlier movie with the same name, gets an ""Avatar""-like treatment where a group of teens plug in an old console from the 90's and are teleported in the jungle world of Jumanji via different video game characters, in the likes of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan, each with their own special set of skills that should help them retrieve a magical jewel and end the game.The movie is action-packed with an amusing approach to a sort-of video game adaptation of a fictional game. You will definitely be entertained by the silliness of the characters and how the teens react to their full-grown adult bodies.It became apparent that ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" is Jake Kasdan's freshest movie since his directorial debut ""Zero Effect"". It's one of those rare moments where a sequel to a comedy movie surpasses expectations and turns out be a crowd-pleaser, judging by the almost $1 billion box office revenue.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
290,bodhi-13262,Never go swimming with a backpack!,8,30 December 2017,"The infamous board-game as we know it has evolved, and this time it has taken the form a new system with new players. Having hit the reset button, does the 'Jumanji' from the 90s adapt as well as it does in the present day?1. Picking up where we left off from the original 1995 film with the board-game buried under the sand on a beach, it is discovered once again. Neglected by its finder, the game transfers into that of an obsolete video-game system which is jump-started by four students serving detention at a local high-school. From that point, they all are sucked into the world of Jumanji and embody their respective avatars they choose to serve as in the game. Keeping this spoiler free, the premise within the game itself is nothing special or original in the least. The players are tasked with finding a certain sacred object of which they must journey and deliver to at a certain sacred place in order to return to the real-world. They all have their respective strengths, weaknesses and abilities which they must use and work together while on their journey. The plot may be simple, but it serves its purpose well enough.2. This movie should be the blueprint for future comedies to show that raunchy, vulgar and excessive sexual humor isn't always necessary in making a film funny and entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the same as I did with the original as a kid growing up. Though the presence of the late Robin Williams will surely be missed, I think he'd be proud of this film. Williams was a comedic genius during his time, but the humor delivered by both Jack Black (Prof. Osbern) and Kevin Hart ('Mouse' Finbar) will have your stomach in knots. Black in particular steals the show more so than Kevin Hart, seeing as his charter is embodied by the self-centered teenage girl Bethany (Madison Iseman). Black's acting and portrayal of his real-life counter-part was nothing short of outstanding. His gestures and voice in particular sold me on him being a girl trapped in a man's body. Don't get me wrong, Kevin Hart has his laugh-out-loud moments as well.3. The action was surprisingly good for a family film. I'm not sure how well younger audiences will fare watching this as there are some frightening sequences as well as brief sexual references and innuendos throughout. Unlike the first, this sequel is PG-13 as it takes certain and surprising liberties I wasn't expecting it to. Whenever there's action....call Dwayne Johnson, who literally delivers a knock-out punch with his performance as the daring Dr. Bravestone. I must say, I enjoyed Johnson's comedic chops in this more than any other film I've seen him in thus far. Never having been a fan of the Jonas Brothers back in the day, Nick Jonas (Alex) actaully surprised me as to how good of an actor he is. I used to cringe at his acting during his Disney channel run, but I'm glad to see he's finally bettered himself. I suppose there's no point in hiding my undying love for Karen Gillan. She's beautiful, deadly, funny and a joy to watch on screen.4. My only complaint and first major flaw of this film is the villain. Bobby Cannavale has proven himself as a good actor, but here he falters as the treacherous hunter/explorer Van Pelt. This movie would have been close to perfect had they not failed to include a worthy antagonist. Van Pelt could have been played by any actor to be honest. The character himself is weak and his goal is like any other cliche in which he wants the thing which the heroes have so he hunts them down to get back the thing that will give him power instead of the other thing happening. Apart from that, the cinematography and editing was phenomenal in this. The breathtaking scenery and shots of the various Hawaiian isles blew me away. Though not as cinematic in scope as 'Kong: Skull Island', it still urges me to want to visit Hawaii. If there was one other minor thing the film was weak in was the score. I felt Henry Jackman could have composed music more exciting.With his last film being the atrocious 'Sex Tape', Jake Kasdan has redeemed himself and proven to also be a good action director. If you're hoping this film to be a tribute to Robin Williams in some way, it really isn't, although it mentions subtle ties to the first. 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' is by far one of the best comedies this year and is certainly on my top 10 list of best movies of 2017.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
291,Her-Excellency,A Most Enjoyable Film Which Endlessly Pulls at the Corners of Your Face,10,7 April 2018,"Who would have thought that the sequel to a much-loved classic would, in my opinion, turn into such a stand-alone powerhouse!?!Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle, does just that. Not only is it a virtual non-stop ride of hilarity and laugh-out-loud moments, and it is, but the chemistry among the adult cast members is practically flawless and lends to the easy banter and overflowing, genius, COMEDIC DIALOGUE which just SHINES. Every look, every gesture, every note from The Rock, Kevin Hart and Jack Black are perfection in that at no time do you doubt they are who they are supposed to be. Karen Gillan is adorable and gorgeous at the same time. The obvious fun they are having, despite what I imagine to be uncomfortable filming locales, is palpable, and as an audience member, _if you allow yourself to be_, you WILL be swept up and transported by it.So, why ANY low ratings?While the first Jumanji was 'fun', underneath the fun, there were dark layers. There is none of that here and perhaps, this is where some of the disconnect from its detractors comes from. Unlike the original Jumanji, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a fun, and funny, film throughout. In closing, quite to the contrary of what a couple of reviewers are saying about Robin Williams, such as: 'he'd be rolling over in his grave (over this movie)', Robin Williams was one of those rare and amazingly special individuals who found joy and humor in most everything, and who chose to share that with those of us who are lucky enough to be witness to some of the favorites he left behind. Personally, I find it in very bad taste and verging on offensive, that those who seem to not share the capacity to laugh or live the way he did, or the ability to laugh with the rest of us, and who lack the gift of both being able to give or receive the very humor which exuded from Mr. Williams, would dare say he would be doing anything other than laughing riotously while munching on some popcorn and watching this film.Thank you, Robin Williams, for the precursor which was so fantastic, it brought about an equally wonderful sequel.You are missed.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
292,Students_SimoneVeil,the best movie of 2017 !,9,8 January 2019,"It's four teens that are lost in a magic video game (JUMANJI) and the only way to escape is to cooperate to finish the game and go back to reality. I think that Dwayne Johnson (Spencer), Kevin Hart (Fridge), Jack Black (Bethany), Karen Gillan (Martha) and Nick Jonas (Alex) are so fantastic in their characters. This movie is the most mysterious, the most humorous, the most original because is a good cover and the funniest movie. And it is really little scary. Jake Kasdan was the best director for this movie. The special effects ars just really splendid and I liked are. It's the best movie I've ever seen. I recommend it 100% because it is the most captivating and the funniest movie in this world.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
293,ellimic,"a good sequel to the original, and much better than I had thought it would be",7,31 December 2017,"A great film, lots of funny moments and the actors were really good; I particularly thought Jack Black played his role really well.
I hadn't thought Dwayne Johnson could do comedy, but this proved me wrong.I liked how they modernised it as a video game as board games aren't as popular anymore.
I thought it was really a good idea to add the NPC's and especially, what I sometimes find annoying in games, the set responses to questions and the seemingly ceaseless repetition of game objectives (its just a shame that every other NPC didn't play on the role as well as Rhys Darby did). And the player skills data was a good addition too like the character guide on numerous other video games.I liked how they linked it to the original film with the box being found in the sand where it washed up at the end of the last film, and Alan Parrish's house in the jungle.
It didn't occur to me at the cinema but when I rented this online I realised the 'bad guy' is called Van Pelt, a link to the 'bad guy' who was sucked back into Jumanji at the end of the last film.
Also, when the four other players find the 'missing piece' in the basket beneath the snake, they take out an elephant figurine which, if I remember the original film correctly, is identical to the game piece used by Alan Parrish.A couple of differences that I did notice however is that Alex was unaware of how much time had passed while he was in the game, whereas Alan Parrish knew exactly how long it had been and frequently reminded people of it.
Also in this new film, everyone retained thier memory of the events after returning to the real world, whereas in the original film the children, Peter and Judy, presumably had no memory of the game, or at least they made no effort at the end of the film to suggest otherwise (although it could be rgued that when Alan ans Sarah encounter the children in the future, the events of Jumanji have not happened to them yet as it was before thier parents had died).",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

So funny I was laughing really heard. But about the movie. It starts off exactly where the first one left off which is pretty amazing and awesome but after that great scene then the movie just spirals down to another 5/10 hollywood crap-fest. Filled with cliche moments, forced laughter and such cringe worthy moments I just had to look up into the ceiling because it was really terrible at times. True the movie has it moments and it is funny at times but the main plot is nothing like the original which I saw last week and it still holds up and that is a 8/10 movie even though it has some lame jokes here and there. But it's a truly amazing movie. But when it comes to this one. Sure it is entertaining and The cast is great but the movie is so poorly written and I was sitting there expecting a twist or something cool to happen but it's really lame if you compare it to the first movie which was and still is an amazing movie. The intro and build up of Alan Parrish story which seems like a Stephen King inspired moment, how it is filmed and the style and yeah everything. But nope I really wanted to like this movie but I can't give more than 5/10 because of all the terrible, cliche, cringe and hollywood nonsense it brings with it. And yes it is even a very weak 5/10.

It really made me wonder how Hollywood is creating these sequels that are geared toward today's youth and teenagers.Honestly, I don't remember the first film have so much sexual humor in it and some language. In my opinion, this was still a win for my money in terms of, Humor, presentation, and of course the generalization of trends that are starting to pop out of the ground in many parts of the world.It seems to me that this sequel really outdid the first one in terms of special effects and storyline. And it seems like there could be a third one.Jumanji 2 is still very warm to the touch and it's sort of got that Breakfast Club feel to it. You will see what I mean when you see it.It also kept aligned with it's original source material. Still though, go into this movie with an open mind.

301,stan_gee,When Is This Going To Get Funny?,3,8 March 2018,"Let me start this by saying, wherever Robin Williams is, he must be rolling over and raising his BUTT to whoever in Hollywood who came up with this script, cause it is wacked, or maybe a better word is, it sucks big time.It's not funny, it's to stupid to be funny, and putting Nick Jonas in this didn't help, but I'm sure the producers were hoping to pull on Nick's fan base of Bubble Gummers, and Gay Guys who worship at the Nick Jonas alter. The only thing this movie have going for it is the name for those of us to remember the original classic, and that's about all. I gave it three stars because it's not a remake, it's a first time mess up and even thou it screws up the premise of the entire first movie, it will never compare or even be as close to be funny, Robin Williams was a Comedic Genius, Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson is only in it for name recognition. the girls, don't know what they are suppose to be, but they should have stayed home on this one.Anyway, if anyone reads this, let me say you some time, it sucks, it sucks so bad, the dog is hiding under the coffee table, oh my gawd, with his paws covering his eyes, if you have time to waste, this yeah, I recommend this, it can't get much worst, or can it???? You decide.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
302,Jemae,Very good,8,21 May 2019,"With a 7 out of 10 on IMDb, it's understandable why this film did so well.It's nothing like the original and doesn't try to be like it. It's, it's own film that pays homage to the Robin Williams original.It starts with a young man playing video games on what looks like an atari console, who was handed a board game. After the game turns itself into an Atari cartridge, the young man plays the game and gets sucked in. 20 years go by and four teenagers find it and also join the game.Jack Black stole the show, his portrayal as a teenage girl, who's trapped in a middle aged man's body, was perfect. While each actor did a great job, Jack's performance was the best.The humour in the movie was good, it wasn't forced, like I've seen in other movies, its more authentic.What I didn't like was the villain....he was very weak and it was horrible and boring to watch him.At the end of the film the four teenagers go to check out the freak house, which is where Alex lived and went missing from (20 years ago). They stand on the road watching as a silver car pulls up and a man and his family hop out. Older Alex is played by Colin Hanks, and he spots the teens and walks towards them.They immediately start talking as if they know each other and Alex somehow manages to guess all their names right. You think about that, Alex has never seen what they looked like in real life but yet somehow knows it's them from the game.
If I saw four teens staring at me, I'd be freaked out and walk straight into the house....But apart from that it was a good film, easy to watch, I'd be great to watch with the family. I didn't really think I would enjoy this movie, but it caught me by surprise.I didn't see this in cinema, I watched this at home in my bed room and the film looked and sounded great. It would have been a good movie to watch in cinema.I would recommend watching it.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

If they did the same board game then people would be comparing and complaining.I like these kind of sequels, other movies that try to different than original were Cars 2, Ralph Breaks Internet; but those weren't great themselves but Jumanji:Welcome to the Jungle stands on its own feet.Great casting choices. Jack Black has so much fun playing Bathany and the pee scene is one of the best comedy scene I have seen in a while. Rock and Hart has great comedy ( btw I hated central intelligence). Karen Gillan, her introvert counterpart, trying to be sexy and kick ass was hell of a lot of fun. Her complaining about tiny cloths are some great meta jokes about entertainment industry.Story and plot progressing were bad but its a video game and the writers have so much fun taking liberties with it that I have no problems with that.Some good thrills were brought with the concept of 3 lives and game over. All 4 characters finding about themselves and discovering the new rules and mythology with the audiences were great. Rock,Karen and Jack brings something new to the table but Kevin Hurt plays himself, while some jokes did land pretty well.One of the most funniest, highly entertaining comedies of this time.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
306,ZCDomingos,I loved it more than I want to admit,10,26 December 2017,"I'm going to be honest, at first I really didn't consider watching this, specially because I watched the first one and I feel in love instantly. I mean, these days sequels to a 20 years old movies or reboots aren't that great, and I'm not that stingy with reboots, because I just want to watch a movie and not compare to the original one, I like watching it as a standalone. But with these one, I was so worried, but oh man, I love to be wrong in these situations.
It was brilliant, I was not feeling the modern version of Jumanji, but that was cleared in the beginning and it didn't bothered me that much, actually. The characters were amazing to watch, mostly because I easily related to them if I was in that situation with my friends. 
The plot was good enough, nothing new and unique, but it was well planned and cohesive, and that's one of the most important aspects of a plot. 
The game theme was so well written in this movie, and once again super cohesive and it follows it's rules, which demonstrates excellent writing and not just ""for a moment in particular alteration"". The cast was phenomenal, even though I liked The Roch way more before, it was still pleasant to watch him in a different role, actually more funny and interesting than I want to admit, and the rest of the cast I was already in love, specially Jack Black, who killed this performance alongside Kevin Hart and Karen Gillian (who I never watch before, but I'm already in love).
This is a perfect family adventurous movie, you don't have to watch the first one, but there are easter eggs in this sequel that are so special to those who enjoyed the first one, like me.

307,benoyum111,"THERE Is a HUGE LOGICAL MISTAKE in the sequels!!! (But unlike other Sony movies, it was FUN,)",5,19 June 2021,"If you make a sequel, you have to keep the main structure of the first movie. No, I am not talking about a board game turning itself into a computer game, that was ok.*In the first movie, when the game finally ends, everything have turned back to where it had started, to where when Robin Williams character was still a kid and the other two kids that had played the game many years later doesn't know anything, because everything went back to normal, so those two kid would have never played the game, in the future or past, whenever!You know what I mean if you watch the first movie.So the Jumanji game doesn't live a trace behind it, except for what has changed in the memories and the souls of the first players...BUT, the squeals made this huge mistake! The first player of the Jumanji game, the Alan character, remembers everything, ok, but how come the other four teenagers had played the game, if everything had turned back to where it started!!! How come that four teenagers had been able to play the game, if the first player found himself back in his room with the Jumanji game next to him??? Did he leave the game to the school!!! That would be so ridiculous and stupid!I guess the film makers have done this so that they can make another sequel with those four teenagers. And it seems they have gone over with it!I have checked the reviews of the sequels, but it seems no one have noticed this logical error!I think what makes fantasy movies great is that, it combines the reality and imagination, and it has to be combined so well that, the movie should be realistic, logical and at the same time has a fantasy in it that is believable, so that the audience feels that they are getting shifted to another world from theirs.These Jumanji sequels fails very much on this.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
308,plpregent,"Hilarious characters and creative writing driven by a self-mocking sense of humour, packaged into a very satisfying Blockbuster",7,13 March 2018,"Despite some moments of typical over-the-top blockbuster silliness, which includes a bit too much questionable CGI for my own taste, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is quite a fun ride whose qualities should satisfy moviegoers amongst several age groups.The film is more or less related to the original Jumanji film, making a few mentions of the Parrish family here and there, without ever making tight connections between the first entry and this one. Instead, this sequel takes a humorous approach, tackling the habits of today's youth, notably when the box containing the game is first handed to a teenager, who does not waste a second leaving it on a shelf, opting to keep playing videogames instead.The game itself is totally different: it's a videogame now, which sucks any player into a parallel universe filled with jungle, armed to the teeth mercenaries, different levels, cut scenes, and the likes. Players get to be the avatar that they chose, each of which has different perks and weaknesses. Although the script is more than often highly predictable and the moral of the story is beyond clichéd, the writers managed to compensate with hilarious character interactions and the ""double identity"" situation, which bring surprises and laughs aplenty. The cast does a perfect job incarnating clichéd but fun characters stuck in even more clichéd avatars, which are all tailored to be delivered with a great self-mocking sense of humour. Kevin Hart and Jack Black are absolute riots in this film. The biggest quality of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is that it never takes itself seriously. It is a highly enjoyable blockbuster for the most part. It is still a blockbuster and, accordingly, there are moments when action, camera movements and CGI reach ridiculous highs. Its qualities, though, make up for these few annoying moments, and make it a quality character-driven comedy, thanks to the ""avatar"" twist, which adds a layer of humour that quickly becomes the film's main attraction. A surprisingly fun time not to be missed.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
309,MichaelNontonMulu,A Funnier Sequel to the Famous Robin Williams' Movie,8,20 December 2017,"Well this movie was exactly what I would hope for in term of comedic situation and provided us a good amount of laugh. In fact what my wife and I noticed was the movie was a lot more comedic than adventurous. This was a bit different from the movie's predecessor, the 1995 version of Jumanji which felt having more adventure. Apart from being a sequel to that movie, this one also served as a tribute to Robin Williams who played the lead character of Alan Parrish. From my personal view, the original movie was something that truly blow my mind with the obviously awesome special effect at that time and also a wonderful experience seeing so many animals came and wreak havoc in the city. While in this movie, the characters were the ones who went inside the game and the animals scenes were not that frequent.The movie seemed to focus on the characters development and chemistry which were fun to see. I actually loved Jack Black's character whom I think was totally spot on. Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson seemed to hit it off very easily, most likely because they had played in an action comedy movie earlier Central Intelligence. Meanwhile Karen Gillan was totally different from the other roles that I had seen earlier as she provided few funny moments, with the funniest one relating to 2 bad guards. What I loved the most was the high school students were transformed into totally different adult persons and had to adjust themselves with their transformation. Though this also provided some rather crude jokes which probably not understood by young children. The special effects were definitely a lot better than the 1995 version (especially if you see the old one now). During the almost 2 hours duration of the movie, my wife and I had plenty of laughs and for me personally, I was happy and satisfied watching this one as it provided me with the light pop corn movie where I do not have to overthink and just enjoy it. Btw, there was no end credit scene in the movie which was rather surprising as I thought (and hoped) there would be one.Anyway, if you are looking for a fun, light, comedy adventure movie, then you definitely should see this one. If you have seen the original movie, you might also enjoy this as it had the aura and some scenes that would remind you with that one. It would be best if you have seen the original movie first before seeing this one to really appreciate and understand it better. And please do not expect a heavy logical movie where you need to over analyze it. Just go to the cinema and experience the fun.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

311,rebeccalucy,Very surprising!,7,20 December 2017,"A surprisingly good continuation of this series, with some good humour and a modern update with a twist. The acting is decent, with the rock and Kevin Hart giving better performances than usual. But Karen Gillan and Jack Black supplied most of the great comedy in the film. Jack had to portray a very stereotypical popular girl, but he gives it all he has got and adds some much needed heart. However, the villian is very under used and bland. Bobby Canavale did not have any time to develop his character, so he does seem as such a big threat.I really enjoyed the video game update, with the multiple lives they allow for urgency and a little comedy. They definitely use the video game idea to their advantage, but it could become a little dated in the future. Also, some of the comedy falls flat and could become dated also. Such as the constant references to technology. The cinematography and editing is basic but that obviously wasn't the focus. Some of the backgrounds are beautiful with the lush jungle.

313,iamianiman,Jumanji Turns into a New Generation of Games,5,20 March 2018,"It has been over 20 years since the release of the original Jumanji, and quite honestly, I never once thought about ever needing a sequel or revamp of that classic material. I mean, just over ten years ago we saw a great little film in Zathura, so I had my fill of this type of movie. That being said, I never thought I'd be writing a review that tells people to go out and see a film that completely altered what the original film was, but here I am. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a really fun time at the movies. I won't be comparing it to the original because they both fit their times. Although it's not without its issues, here's why I believe Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle deserves to be seen in theatres. Being a fan of the original film, I wasn't too keen on the video game aspect that this sequel was injecting into the franchise, but it really worked for me in the context of the story. As the film follows four very generically-stereotyped characters in Spencer, Fridge, Bethany, and Martha, they find themselves stuck in detention after school hours. Coming across an old video game console, they plug it into the television and are sucked into the world of Jumanji. Yes, the question everyone will be asking is how the board game is now a video game, but the movie does a solid job in nodding to the fans about that. After being sucked into the game, they become the avatars they chose. The characters, played by Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan are all fantastic here, playing though they're still their outside selves. This aspect is what makes the movie worth it because it allows them to discover new things about themselves, either giving them bravery or realizing life is just fine for them in the outside world. The morals of the story and the climax itself has been seen in thousands of movies throughout the years, but it's all about how a movie is executed these days, and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle sucks you in with these characters and provides a very fun adventure, for the most part. This film asks you to pretend that you're actually in a video game with these characters, so repetitive dialogue from secondary characters can become hilarious if you're thinking with that mindset, but also odd for those who are unfamiliar with video games. This brings me to my biggest negative about this movie, because a video game follows either one or multiple characters at the same time, making discoveries along the way. A video game never cuts away to show other plot-lines forming, but this movie does feel like an actual movie at times, cutting away to the villain of the story, who's also the weakest aspect of it as well. The villain, played by Bobby Cannavale (who I'm actually a huge fan of as an actor), is far too over-the-top in this role, which can be funny at times, but it feels out of place when placing random scenes of him and his henchmen throughout the movie.Personally, this portion of the film annoyed me and I couldn't wait to get back to the central characters. In the end, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is fun for fans of the original, providing winks and nods to the first film throughout the movie, as well as providing a fun adventure for all newcomers. From bumping into characters like Alex (Nick Jonas) in order to add some emotional aspects, to having some pretty cool action sequences, to providing humor that both adults and kids can laugh at, I didn't have any glaring issues with the film itself, aside from the incredibly annoying villain subplot. Overall, although not complex in the slightest, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fun time at the movies, plain and simple.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
314,vesil_vesalier,"I didn't think this would work, but I'm happy to be proven wrong.",8,31 March 2018,"I love being surprised by movies, don't you?I've said before that expectations destroy movies, and I still hold that it's true. But what's interesting is having LOW expectations of movies. Then, when you go in expecting to hate every freaking scene in the film, you're pleased when there are things about it you liked.In the case of what I guess is classified as a ""Reboot"" (although having an Easter Egg planted right smack in the middle of the movie that tells you otherwise means it's a sequel), JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE was an absolute riot.I liked the original JUMANJI, but I never fell in love with it. Robin Williams was excellent because honestly, even in amazingly bad films such as TOYS, it wasn't Robin I was irritated with. Guys like him always push it as hard as they can, but they can't do more than what they're stuck to work with.Comparing the two, I would say that what truly was lacking in the original was a definitive sense of humor. Trying to balance humor and drama is tough, VERY tough, because the themes don't generally mix together. One usually dominates over the other, making one the flavor while the other is the main course. In the first JUMANJI, it wasn't demanding enough to be scary, and it wasn't funny enough to be hilarious.While I won't say that WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE is scary in any way, it does at least TRY to have a more pressing urgency to it. The original wasn't terribly clear on the more interesting rules of the game: if one of the players died, for REAL, what would have happened? It's presumed, based on the theme of the film, that it's not possible for the players to die. Here, coming up with a definite penalty system, clearly illustrated early on in the predicament of the four students stuck in Jumanji, the pressure is on. It's delivered with humor, but it's there, and it keeps you guessing throughout the film as to what exactly Game Over would be, when somebody fails.One of the most shining moments of the film has to be the main cast, acting as if they were the teenagers that inhabit their bodies. On the comedy side, nobody can beat Jack Black, who is the avatar of the popular cellphone-obsessed white teenage girl, reacting and over-reacting to the fact that she's now an overweight, middle-aged pudgy white dude. Dwayne Johnson also shines here, stretching his acting muscles to emulate the leader of the gang, as they try to team up and make their way through Jumanji. Karen Gillan, whom I've never had the pleasure of seeing in anything before now, was also hilarious in her own way, her avatar being the opposite of the teenager that's stuck inside of her. And Kevin Hart, the man who makes comedy as a profession, is good, but strangely outplayed here, delivering yuks but never really stealing the show. On the dramatic side, the film never does take itself too seriously, but I believe it to be one of its strengths. The main drama comes from the ticking of the clock, from the pressure of racing toward the ending without assurances that everything's going to be okay. If you want a criticism, I will give you two of them: I'm not sure if the kids who start out the movie are acting poorly, or acting poorly on purpose. I think it's the latter, where the director knew he'd have less screen time with them than with their avatars, so he needed a way to kind of... over-identify their personalities early on, so you could see Dwayne and co. pull off such great jobs at emulating them. I THINK that's the reason. Because honestly, the first part of this movie was, for me, the toughest to get through.Secondly, the villain's scenes seemed unnecessary, most of the time. The team could have been fighting Jumanji as a semi-formed background filled with enemies, and it would have been just as effective. The heavy, whose character is a nod to the original JUMANJI, feels out of place here, without a real definitive character or personality of any kind.Overall, however, I had a blast with this film, and I laughed myself to tears through a lot of it. I don't remember having NEARLY as much fun with the original. The marketeers want to call this a ""reboot"", and I see, according to IMDb, that the studios are already gearing up for what's listed as ""JUMANJI 2"", but I don't care what the marketeers are saying, cause it's just not true. This was a SEQUEL to the original, and it lives in that rarest of categories where it was much better than the original.And that's where I will leave it. The review, I mean.

One, that there is one part of this film that needs, for me at least, to be noted for why I think it didn't work, and two, a remark about the marketing of this film, how it is considered to be a remake, when there clearly is evidence that it is actually a sequel.My first problem can seem to be nit-picky, but hear me out. One thing I truly DID like about the original JUMANJI was the use of Jonathan Hyde, as both Alan Parrish's father AND as the villainous Van Pelt. Van Pelt, if you didn't know, (which is why this is a SPOILER review) is the name given to the heavy in WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE. This is both good and bad, which is why it is a problem for me.The good, is that it supports the notion that this is a SEQUEL, not a reboot or a remake. The bad, is that the original Van Pelt had a purpose. He HAD a character, and while it could be argued that he was simply an entity of Jumanji, casting him with the actor who played Alan's father was a masterstroke. Who better to be constantly hunting him in Jumanji than the ghost of his own father, the very thing that drove him away in the first place? In WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE, we have no such definition for Van Pelt. He's just a villain, one who's rotting from the inside out, it seems, as bugs and other insidious creatures crawl in and out of him. But that's the most character we get. He barely has any lines, he doesn't have a focus. And unlike the original Van Pelt, who represented Alan's fears as well as his father, this one has nothing at all on any of the characters whatsoever. I honestly think you could have filmed around him completely and the film's quality wouldn't change.Don't get me wrong, however--it doesn't detract from the overall quality of the film enough to bother me. It's just interesting to note.And then we get to my second problem, the marketing. It frightens me, considering just how many remakes are coming out, that somehow this is looked at as not only a marketing gimmick, but a PROFITABLE one, at that. In a day and age when movies can be watched, in a variety of ways, from a very wide variety of time periods, are we really accepting ""okay"" to such a degree that we're making remakes good business strategy? PLEASE tell me it's not true. The only remake I've ever seen (so far) that was better than the original was IT (of which I've recently written a review, if you're interested), and that was a remake of the first part of a mini-series. I'm not saying that's why it worked (honestly I couldn't tell you exactly why it worked at all, it just DID), but I am saying making a remake that's better than the original is as hard and unlikely as making a sequel that's better than the original (which, ironically, we have here, with WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE).This is NOT a remake, for several reasons. One, the most obvious for me, was the scrawl carved into a board at Alex's refuge spot, ""ALAN PARRISH WAS HERE"". Adding to it that the villain of the game's name was Van Pelt, who was the most dangerous of all the threats in the original, and you've got a strong case for identifying this as a sequel.I have a couple more. The original JUMANJI ends with the game's thumping drums as it lies, half-buried in the sand. This is EXACTLY where the game is re-discovered, at the beginning of this film. It evolves, showing the passage of time, into a video game that's closer to our time. If it's just a reboot, or even a remake, why use the original board at all? Why not just have Alex find it, or buy it in a used game shop or something?See, I don't have any moral arguments against sequels. Trying to make another story out of one that worked, and worked WELL, is not surprising. What IS surprising is having one that works, and what's even MORE surprising is having one that outshines the original. Out of the more than 1600 films I've seen (and counting), only TWENTY that I've found have either matched the originals in quality, or superseded them. Well, now it's twenty-one.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

The comedy is slapsticky and ordinary - which is usually the case in all Action/Adventure because the makers of such films usually do not have the mature ""comedy sense"" as can be seen in films like Mrs Doubtfire & Parental Trap. But Karen Gillan as Ruby Roundhouse was NOT convincing at all! She just was not properly trained for the fight scenes. Her so-called ""dance fighting"" just falls flat!

319,radmanart,One of the worst new movies I have ever seen.,1,29 March 2018,"Ripped off at the Redbox again. I thought I was going to see a modern day remake of the original Jumanji. If it was a modern day remake of the original Jumanji with CG; it would have been great. The great thing about the original; is the game spilled over into reality. This movie is not reality at all and is so, very stupid. The original Jumaji is so much better than this and it is over 28 years old; that means this movie should not have been made. e are a advanced society compared to 1995. Somehow all of our advancements mean nothing in movie making quality; if this movie is acceptable to the movie going audience.Rock was cool. Glad he is still working. He was very cool in San Andreas (2015). Long live The Rock. Jack Black is awesome; but hated him as a girl in this horrid movie. I bow to Jack Black now and forever.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
320,regula1,"Very, very fun and worth your time!",8,8 December 2017,"The original Jumanji was supposed to be a one-and-done film, even though it teased the potential for a sequel. Many voiced trepidation at the prospect of a sequel after all these years later, and after the tragic death of original star Robin Williams, there were valid concerns about whether this sequel could be both a good movie and a fitting sequel and tribute to what had come before.I am glad to report that it fulfilled all expectations.The film relies almost entirely on its star power, and it has that in spades with the likes of Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas. Where the charm resides, though, is the actors playing against their types through the means of real-world to video game body switching: The Rock embodying a nerdy hypochondriac, Hart an all-star jock, Gillan a shy insecure reject, and perhaps most brilliant of them all, Black housing a she's-all-that pretty girl. Together our four teenage protagonists get sucked into the video game incarnation of Jumanji, a jungle land that is threatened from the typical video game threat, and our heroes must do the usual video game tasks in order to beat the game and return to the real world, all without getting killed in-game, which will get them killed in real life after three lives.The film thematically treads the same sort of ground that other teen movies tend to cover, mainly the stereotypical high school tropes get thrust into a situation that forces them to work together to correct each other's flaws and by the end they return to their 'normal' lives as better people.What the film does different in the body-switching is that these tropes are transferred onto adult actors, people who each have tropes of their own, and the way that each actor gets to play against their type is definitely what makes this movie so fun.On the flipside, like a video game, the villain is very one- dimensional, and while the narrative isn't necessarily harmed by it, it does stand out as something that's lacking, wishing that the villain was more than just 'I will kill you because reasons'.Also, the character introductions in the real world at the beginning of the film feel very forced, as in we all know they end up in the game, and the reasons they get into the situation feel very convenient, as if the writers could not find an elegant means to get these four people in the same place in front of the game console at the same time, so they just threw them all together.These are fairly minor nitpicks, as the pace of this film is fast, it doesn't really drag at all, and while they do repeat a joke or two, it doesn't step over the line into annoying. All this makes for a very fun film, definitely worth your time this holiday season, and after once it gets released on home media.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
321,fletcherc21,A fun action comedy for the whole family,7,21 December 2017,"This sequel essentially only brings the name and concept of getting trapped in a game from the original. It is essentially an action heavy version of The Breakfast Club, as four high schoolers from different social groups are all in detention together and get sucked into the game. Along the way they grow and develop and move past their differences and realize they need to work together to get out of the game. The core of the movie is simple body swap comedy, which they all do well, but Jack Black excels in particular as a shallow self obsessed teenage girl trapped in Jack Black's body. The plot is essentially a video game, reminiscent of Tomb Raider or Uncharted, but used as a vehicle for humorous moments. The humor plays to all ages with jokes targeted at kids and jokes for adults. The adult jokes were mostly about flirting and social interactions with very few of them being sexual. There was only one joke that the 7 year old next to me felt the need to ask his mom about, but it was subtle enough that she could just move past it. There was also not a single fart or poop joke, which is a miracle in a modern comedy.This sequel is one of the few that actually surpasses the original, which was scarier for kids and not as funny for everyone else. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is the action comedy that leans on the comedy and is actually funny without being crude.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
322,MovieHead123,I usually never enjoy sequels (just one spoiler),10,8 March 2018,"I was skeptical at first because sequels usually turn out to be a disappointment, hence Mean Girls 2 and every Scream movie after the original one. I can name so many sequels in where I thought to myself, ""The should have just stopped after the first one"". I thought I'd feel the same way about Jumanji 2 Welcome To The Jungle, especially since the first one is one of the best movies of all time. It is a movie i shared with my daughter in hopes that it'd bring as much joy to her as it did to me as a child. Robin Williams and Kristin Dunst, talk about two of the most recognized actors in the 90's. Robin Williams played a big role in my childhood, as he brought so much laughter into my home with all of his movies, such as Mrs. Doubtfire, Ferngully, Aladdin, etc. He's the only celebrity who I've shed tears for when hearing the tragic news of his death (besides Anton Yelchin, that one hit me pretty hard too). Anyway, back to the point. You could see why my expectations for the second Jumanji were just ""blah"" so to speak. Boy, was I wrong! Of course, it doesn't compare to the original. However, it is absolutely hilarious and very entertaining. Not one dull moment. I LOVED IT! I could not stop laughing. I also choked up a bit in the end when grownup Alex tells Bethany that he named his daughter after the girl who saved his life. I always enjoy watching Jack Black and Dwayne Johnson. I love Kevin Hart as an actor, but not a fan of his standup. Anyway, I definitely recommend this movie. I gave it a 10. I gave the original Jumanji a 10 as well. but that's only because I couldn't give it a 20.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Bringing the board game into the video game age was something I was at first skeptical about, but ultimately it worked very well, in addition to casting adults as opposed to a majority children cast.Having two separate generations come together between the 1990's culture meeting 2000's culture was a another brilliant idea.This is a movie I could watch more than once.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

I did like the chemistry between the characters, i liked the casting ... and it was an all in all very enjoyable movie.I was not blown away by the story though.. the story and the storytelling was stale and boring. It also seemed not to really know what it was trying to do with the game itself. If it was to be a computer game .. there were only very few and rather annoying snippets of what some computer games are like (like dumb NPCs and so) .. while if it was an adventure movie, those game sections felt out of place. While i liked the idea of it being a computer game, the director did not go the whole way .. and so it wasn t more than a little side feature, easily forgotten and irrelevant.The effects were rather bad in some scenes and OKish in others. CGI is not yet there though .. especially the animals looked very very bad (maybe they were meant to?) and did not blend into the world at all.However ... as i said, the character were good, and the movie as a whole was enjoyable.. just not outstanding.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

The foursome is a typical Breakfast Club like group of a jock, a nerd, a beauty queen and a social outcast that doesn't realize that she's pretty all in for a detention. Their job on detention is to clean up a storage room in the basement of the school. They soon stumble over an old video game system and all 4 get sucked into the game.Hilarity ensues as they all end up as opposite characters in the game than the really are.

But this is no good thing to say ! Here, we got a good start, the first 20 minutes were enjoyable. I can even accept the fact it's in a jungle and played like a video game... but the next 90-100 minutes are NOTHING like the beginning...Plus, the chemistry between the actors, you don't feel it. Sure, they played like teen. In some way, Jack Black was the most interresting but he failed at capturing a Young teen girl who think she is a queen... in my view, Dwayne ''The Rock'' Johnson should have played this character. A hyper muscular guy that abuse ''roids'' who make a delicious little queen girl, that will be more fun to the viewers than some kind of a badass who don't think he is....Now... the title, Welcome to the Jungle.

345,CinematicGarbage,Much better than the previous Jumanji (1995),3,1 May 2019,"Jumanji (2017) is the sequel of an adventure movie Jumanji (1995). It took about 22 years to wait for a sequel of this awesome and risky movie which took us to experience the animals and disaster nature caused to the city. But the sequel, which is this movie, is actually better than the previous one. There is more adventure in this movie.
Starring Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) as Dr. Smolder Bravestone, Kevin Hart as Franklin Moose Finbar, Karen Gillan as Ruby Roundhouse (Killer of Men), Jack Black as Professor Shelly Oberon (The Curvy Genius). The acting is great and it had impressed me a lot. They embodied their own characters. However, it seemed really unfair that Dr. Bravestone had no weakness but Moose Finbar had 3 weaknesses.
The plot is also good. Four students in detention found a game console (maybe) and was sucked inside (sounds cool huh?). They tried to get out of the video game and took lots of risks having only 3 lives. It's like trying to figure out your character or maybe figure out what you have done wrong. Sometimes it can be ""like the nature, don't stick to technology (especially Bethany)"". Maybe a 8.3/10 because sucking into the video game is really cool and way better than playing a board game.
There is great humor and it is worth bad languages to make someone laugh. The deaths are funny as well like Shelly Oberon's and Moose Finbar's (when he explodes because he ate cake (his weakness)). I like it when Ruby Roundhouse fought the two guards (she's a badass).
The CGI effects are really cool, better than the previous movie. There're black bars, beautiful backgrounds and way better than a normal jungle. We are given a way better adventure than the last one and a way better Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) (not like that stupid old hag in 1995 holding a rifle because he's really boring even though he's a better villain and had a more evil character). In this movie, they had a different mission, to take the jewel and put it on a jaguar's eye and can return to their real world. This is not like wearing Virtual Reality glasses with 360° but much better. The animals were more dangerous and the rhinos in the stampede were way bigger than real ones and the stampede to me was extremely deadly. They were fast, aggressive and dangerous.
The music score was really satisfying and suitable for the jungle adventure thanks to Henry Jackman. He did really well and the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly, especially ""The Jumanji Overture"".
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is much better than Jumanji (1995) for its CGI effects, humor, background and original score. It's also one of the greatest video game movies. A 8.1/10 from me.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
346,NarniaIsAwesome,Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is... Mildly Funny and Underwhelming.,4,29 June 2018,"When I first heard of this film, I was skeptical of how it could measure up to the original 'Jumanji.' It's not my absolute favorite comedy ever, but it was entertaining and fun. Then I heard of the cast - Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, and so on. All have a pretty good track record for being very funny, so my hopes were lifted.So, this film basically broke box office records, remaining in my dinky hometown theater for at least 2 and a half months (and that's a big deal for them). And then when it came to DVD, it was impossible to get for weeks - all copies were rented constantly. When I finally rented it, I thought, ""This must be a REALLY good movie!"" Then I watched it...At first, I was surprised at how not funny it was. But it was still only the beginning - the characters were still just kids - so I waited for the real stars to show up. And they did... and it still wasn't funny! Jack Black was hamming it up way too much as a teenage girl, and The Rock was only given predictable lines to work with. Karen Gillan was a dull character. The only actor that solicited any out-loud laughs from me was Kevin Hart, whose character suffers from a hilarious cake weakness. But most of the joke writing was lazy, as if it was whipped up in a hurry and the writers spent more time on mind-boggling action and not laughs.Aside from the performances, the plot was flimsy and predictable. The villain was stereotypical, and the film was mostly ""normal"" action, not many animal stampedes (other than one scene of rhinos) or living vines.Also, in the original movie, Jumanji is portrayed as a rough place and the game sends animals and monsters to terrorize our world. But now, suddenly the players are compelled to SAVE Jumanji from the villain's clutches so it can be restored to a place of beauty. Why?Lastly, I felt the Guns 'n' Roses song wasn't used enough - it was only played once during the end credits. When you've got a great song like ""Welcome to the Jungle,"" and it's IN your TITLE, it should be showcased more and be the movie's ""theme.""In short, if you value your time and energy, you just might want to skip 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' and see the original from 1995 instead.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

It is a sequel, sure, but while paying clever homages to the original, it is completely doing its own thing with truly likable and relatable characters, some real tear-jerker moments and a few scenes that actually do get slightly intense (nothing like the intensity the original created, but while that movie was quite dark, this is a comedy, plain and simple).

Lately, it's hard to find something the entire family can watch together and I am surprised Hollywood didn't do their normal ""filth"" on this one.
It's probably one of the best movies I've seen out of Hollywood this past year in that it was filled with excitement, intrigue, comedy, and even has a message of character and integrity and doing what is right and good... this movie has encouraged me a little considering what normally comes out of Hollywood.
I will watch this one again.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
350,kashidomar,A perfect fantasy movie for all age.........,7,8 December 2017,Although this is a very enjoyable movie for the kids but i have enjoyed it quite a lot. A very good fantasy as well as adventure comedy movie.I remember an old jumanji movie of 1995 but this one is far better than that.The movie is about the four kid who accidentally found an old game that took them into the world of game and full of quest to perform. Gamers will find it very exciting as these four kid runs through different experiences and missions to keep them alive. The movie moves forward along with the same pace of the game and finally reveals it's final stage.The actions are quite acceptable. Some comedy scenes are very very amusing. Dwayne johnson has done really well along with his other three companions.This is not a serious type of movie at all. So please don't watch it seriously.Rather seat and watch it for fun. You will get lot of this from it.,Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

354,travishouze,"""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" Comes Ready to Play",7,30 December 2017,"Remaking, rebooting or making a sequel to any 90's family film is almost always deemed sacrilegious. While we have seen some really bad films come from that, we've yet to really see one that put in the time and effort to make it worth while. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle tries to step into the ring and surprisingly keeps a great level of energy even most comedies this year haven't been able to achieve.The film takes place in modern day as Jumanji the board game has evolved into a shape of a Atari like cartridge console and is discovered by 4 high school students while in detention. The teenagers decide to start the game as a time passer, and soon realize they get sucked into the video game and become the characters they have chosen. So in order to get out the game, they have to take the jewel to a high mountain and not lose all 3 of their lives in the process.Jumanji takes alot of elements from video game nature, even down to how NPC's (non-playable characters) operate and still able to get the viewer up to speed even if you don't play video games. The film also has a great kinetic energy when it gets into the game mode and never really loses steam. The chemistry between the leads are all really solid, specifically Jack Black playing as the self-centered teenage girl who is even funnier than I would have expected him to be in this kind of role. And for Dwayne Johnson, he's able to carry the uncertain nerd characteristic well, and if you watched him as The Rock during his wrestling days, it makes his ""Smoldering Intensity"" moments that much funnier.As for any setbacks, the villain as about as memorable as any other video game villain. He doesn't have any interesting backstory and doesn't give the characters much of a challenge either. Also while all the other characters are able to play their counterparts well, Kevin Hart feels like he is playing Kevin Hart, despite his teenage character not sharing that similarity.In many ways, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a studio mandated cash-in on a familiar property, but at the same time, is able to have fun with itself. The energy is the right mix of dumb and fun, even at the same time and it's able to be a better video game adaptation than a lot of the one's we've gotten in recent history. This might not be a film remembered 10-20 years from now, but it will definitely suck you in as soon as you press Start.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Jack Black won't win any oscars for his stellar performance as a 17-year old high school sweetheart, but he should. All main characters The Rock, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan worked well together.

Jumanji is fully aware of what sort of film it is and what it's audience wants and it sticks to that formula unashamedly. But that's why Jumanji is a surprising success. It's got enough old school ""Indiana Jones"" style capers to appeal to the nostalgics, whilst incorporating plenty of modern gaming references and in-jokes to entertain a new crowd. There isn't a weak link in the cast (Black and Gillan both comedic standouts) and although highly predictable Jumanji even has a credible moral core.

359,Payback1016,Disappointed on so many levels.,1,31 December 2017,"When I first heard they were gonna do a Jumanji sequel I was excited. Even if Robin Williams couldn't be in it, it would seem like a good idea to see how other victims would encounter the titular board games. But after seeing the trailer and the movie that came with it. All I could see was nothing but disappointment.
I was disappointed that they that this Far Cry knock off dares to steal the name of one of the most influential movies.
I was disappointed as a Whovian that Karen Gillan, who made a killing as The Doctor's tough No Nonsense Mother in Law, Amy Pond-Williams, would pick such a POS and drag down her former franchise by thanking it for this movie in an effort to brainwash Whovians into thinking they are gonna see a great movie just because she is in it. 
I was disappointed at how bad they ruined Van Pelt, from changing him from a nigh unstoppable hunter obstacle to some generic world dominating cliche. 
I was disappointed that they threw the board game away forgetting that even back when Board Games were still relevant in the first movie they get knocked by said movie.
I was disappointed that they basically rehashed the plot of the recent Power Rangers movie by having the ""Heroes"" in detention. 
I was disappointed in the lack of horror that made the first movie great. 
I was disappointed in how much they deflated how intimidating the jungle is meant to be according to Alan Parrish's speech. 
I was disappointed by the fact that they ignored an important part of the story as a whole that once the game is over, everything should be reversed including the memories of said game. 
But what I am mostly disappointed in, was the fact that this movie had done nothing but take a giant urination on both a classic movie and the grave of one of it's well known stars, simply for existing in the first place. If you like the movie, more power to you, but it's not even worth setting on fire let alone watching and well I'm sorry to say Zathura a Kristen Stewart movie was a hell of a lot better sequel than this. Screw everyone that gave this movie the green light.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

361,ratari,Jumanji: Welcome to mediocrity in the Jungle.,1,22 April 2018,"When I saw Jumanji in 1995 Starring Robin Williams, I was immediately swept away . It was non-stop action and fun. It was exhilarating. It was a wild entertaining ride!Now we come to Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017). What can I say?
I like all of the actors. Special effects were great. That's where it just comes to a slow boring, dying, disappointing halt. A few jokes were funny, I'll admit. A good action, comedy HAS TO KEEP YOU OFF BALANCE! That is a must. You have to feel like you just don't know what surprise is around the corner. It has to keep you on the edge of your seat, so to speak and it has keep you laughing. This film did neither. As I have often said, timing is everything in a movie. Dead spots are taboo. A well written and well edited film keeps it moving with constant, ongoing discovery.
This was more like a committee got together and decided to ""get a few throw pillows and some paint and make a movie"".
It felt like each scene was painfully contrived by amateurs. Too many dead spots.Most reviewers here thought it was great. I have to respectfully disagree and go against the grain. I make no apologies.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
362,metztex,A fun ride!,9,24 March 2018,"Spoilers are minor. No major plot give a ways. This film was very entertaining for me. While not as good as the original with Robin Williams, this film does provide a fresh updated look to the story line without compromising the precedent set in the previous film (unlike Last Jedi). Jack Black does an incredible job in this film and found myself laughing up a storm throughout. The Rock does well too but I could tell he was struggling a little with his character which is understandable and certainly not unforgivable. Bottom line, the Rock still did well. Main items I liked...Concept of teamwork!!! This true in everyday life. The struggles of two of characters to find their confidence in themselves is very well played and is great to see that gender is not considered in this area (it never should and is really irrelevant). Nicely done.On the flip side..bringing the other two down to earth into the real world from off their supposed high pedestals was also very nicely done. The football star suddenly stripped of his physical prowess and forced to deal with what most individuals have to on a day to day basis was very well done. Additionally, bringing the popular girl and placing her in a man's body for a time without all the modern toys of her cyberspace life was very entertaining. Granted I grew up in during the time before the internet, let alone ubiquitous cell phone availability, so from my point of view, it is hilarious! If you like action adventure movies with comedy mixed in, and you liked the first Jumangi, chances are you will like this film.

I was gladly proven wrong! This film is based after Jumanji and is through a video game which is more with the times rather than board games, not only this but it is based around two people who are more nerds/geeks (one male and one female) and two of the popular group (one male and one female). As you see them coming to terms with their new characters and making it so that the popular ones are the more weak characters who aren't as popular and vice versa it made the film something for everyone. The casting for this film was amazing and having such amazing actors who made this film hilarious making me even cry with tears at some points. Not only this but there later on in the film there is a part where there is a mention of Alan who was Robin Williams character in the original film. To me this was a perfect way to honor him and the film franchise by acknowledging this and not trying to make it a remake but just a more modern film which shows where Alan was trapped within the game and why he was so scared about what was inside the game itself. This film is amazing and I couldn't praise it high enough and it is a film that is perfect for the whole family.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

372,kastri_gr,Very nice sequel with lot of fun and adventurous scenes,10,15 January 2018,Junmaji Welcome to the jungle was a movie i couldn't expect it could be so exciting.The first Jumanji was very good thanks to Robin Williams who in my modest opinion was a very talented actor not only a comedian but this new version of Jumanji it was a pleasant shock for me.To begin with the movie is set first in 1996 when the jumanji board game was found on a beach and later we see the board game transformed to a video game for Atari console.The first person who plays transfered automatically to Jumanji in the jungle as a pilot and he waited there for 20 years until four young people (who were on detention in a highschool for mutlple reasons) found the Jumanji video game and they also transfered to the jungle as adventurous persons with great knowledge.Though someone can expect what he/she will see Jack Black and Dwayne Johnson act very funny in the movie such as Karen Gillan and Kevin Black give an awesome perfomance and i almost forgot the Van Pelt enemy in the Jumanji who is different in this new movie played by Bobby Cannavale.Rumors say that there is an alternative ending in which the Jumanji turns to a mobile application stated by the actress Karen Gillan.For me it is a movie ofcourse not for an oscar nomination but a movie with lots of fun and it is worth to be seen it in the cinema.,Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
373,psychedelicvoice,I don't get it..,6,7 March 2018,"Sure, we all got different taste etc.
But I've read so many places how great and awesome this movie is. I got to see it. 
And... It just lacks. Decent acting, story was okay. But where was the fun? Where was the Jumanji in this? 
The original was fun, creative. Crazy. While they did ""update"" the game itself in the movie, it just was poorly executed. 
So I really don't get the 10+ reviews going nuts about how great this was. Sure it was watchable and sometimes funny enough, but that was about it. If I had paid to see this myself, I would have felt robbed. 
You might like it, but I just think this was mediocre compared to the original. Could have been done better. Watchable, yes. A 10? No.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

375,darryl-42069,A surprisingly good and enjoyable movie that captures the spirit of the original pretty well,8,24 December 2017,"Wow, just when you thought this movie will bomb... When it was first announced, everyone has low expectations for the stand-alone sequel to the late Robin Williams's 1995 hit. Everyone believes it's going to be a massive failure..Then BOOM! Defying everyone's expectations, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a surprisingly fun, enjoyable movie, that manages to stay true to the originals, while at the same time, might be one of the best video game movie so far.For starters, Dwayne Johnson once again proves that he's likable in every role he recieves, and his role as Smolder Bravestone speaks for itself. Kevin Hart literally plays himself, and he did a great job as Franklin Finbar. Karen Gillan did a great job as Ruby Roundhouse, despite being in a uncomfortable (and controversial) outfit. Jack Black is also really good in his role as Oberon. Nick Jonas also did a good job as Seaplane. The teenagers (Alex Wolff, Ser'Darius Blain, Morgan Turner, and Madison Iseman, playing the real-life counterparts of Dwayne, Kevin, Karen, and Jack's characters respectively) did a great job as well.One of the things that made this movie works really well, is the ""fish-out-of-the-water"" story. Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan, all play a role that's not familiar to them, and they really did a great job. The pacing is perfect, explaining the plot right off the bat, resulting in a more fleshed out and more interesting story. Also, as the game is essentially a video game movie, there were plenty of video game references that some people might don't get it, but for those who understands, I think that it's a great throwback and a cool easter egg as well. The humor in this movie, it works perfectly. There's surprisingly plenty of sex jokes that works, but also not overused. The fight scenes are also very entertaining and over the top too (again, it's a ""video game"" movie, real life physics don't apply).Unfortunately, the movie does suffer from several aspects. The villain, played by Bobby Cannavale who btw did a good performance, like any other movie, is a simple, 1D character, who is simply evil. Though can be menacing, it doesn't change the fact that he's nothing more than some really evil guy who wants to rule everything and destroy anything stands in this way, etc. I also noticed that Kevin Hart's character is the only one of the main characters that is, seemingly not affected by the fish-out-of-the-water situation. I wish Kevin's performance were more out of his usual persona/fish-out-of-the-water performance, rather than playing as himself. Also, Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan has little to no chemistry whatsoever in their really odd awkward romance subplot, and the movie didn't take the more risky route, which is a shame since the final act is, personally, is kinda anticlimactic.Nevertheless, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle proves that Hollywood actually can make a good sequel to the old classics that brings something new to the table, while at the same time stays true to the originals. Fans of the original movie, while could be dissatisfied by the change from the board game to a video game, should watch this movie and came out satisfied, because I believe Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle captures the spirit of the original very well, and I'm really happy that it's actually really good and not just a bad attempt at milking money.Final Score: 8/10",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Some nice tear-jerking moments. If you're a jaded movie-goer - especially if you.ve seen the first Jumanji - you'll find the movie very predictable, and you'll be very happy about it. It's very rewarding to figure out whats going to happen ahead of time. You'll be telling yourself yep, I knew that was going to happen. You'll also have a big grin on your face.

379,jezfernandez,Rare sequel that improves on the original,8,6 January 2019,"I recall watching the original movie 3 times at the cinema when it first came out in 1995. It's an enjoyable ride and the late Robin Williams infuses the story with warmth and heart. Trouble is, Jumanji's plot was nothing to write home about. All the players had to do was roll the dice and attempt to survive whatever horrors flew out of the game.Jake Kasdan's sequel is a much smarter and involved effort - the players actually need to interact with the game if they're ever to escape and go home. In this sense, Welcome To The Jungle shares key similarities with Spielberg's Ready Player One. More significantly, both movies resonate with a modern audience who live and breathe interactive media.Kasdan adds multiple layers to this story, most notably in the way he juxtaposes the lead characters with their avatars. You don't get much bigger and stronger than Dwayne Johnson, yet the character isn't really Smolder Bravestone - it's Spencer, the nervy nerd with a host of allergies and a fear of squirrels. Karen Gillan excels as Martha, clearly appalled at having to live in the body of Lara Croft (sorry, Ruby Roundhouse). ""Why am I wearing this outfit in a jungle? Tiny, little shorts and a leather halter top. I mean, what is this?""Perhaps best of all is the genius move of having the gorgeous, self-obsessed Bethany (Madison Iseman) wind up in the game as an overweight, middle-aged male professor. Jack Black had a blast playing a narcissistic 16-year old and absolutely nails it.The film is a riot and Kasdan manages to balance the action with plausible character development. Mercifully, Kevin Hart (just about) stays on the right side of that very thin funny/annoying line. The action scenes are extremely well done and the characters are often in genuine peril. A canyon helicopter ride is particularly nail-biting and the solution to numerous life-or-death dilemmas come in surprising ways.If you enjoyed Jumanji, don't expect a glossy retread - Welcome To The Jungle truly ups the game. Go ahead and roll the dice; this one's a winner.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

They are making another Jumanji but this time it was going to be set in a video game. I rolled my eyes at that. I read reviews for it and the reviews were overwhelmingly positive. This piqued my interest and I decided to give this movie a try. I was wrong. My initial response was the right one. I had a hard time getting into this movie. The characters are all insufferable right out of the gate. I imagine them being put into Jumanji will bring them a full 180 to being better people and learning valuable lessons. This of course is exactly what happens. This plays on the tropes that video games adhere to. There are some funny moments that go along with this. Something didn't feel right though. Honestly this movie didn't need to be called Jumanji. It had little or nothing to do with Jumanji in any way. It had a few shout out moments to remind people that hey we are actually making a Jumanji movie. You could see all the jokes though coming from a mile away especially anything done by Kevin Hart or Jack Black. It was simply too obvious and Kevin Hart was just relying on his schtick again. I understand that a lot of comedians do this when they make movies until they get tired of it. I haven't seen too many Kevin Hart movies and I'm already tired of it. Jack Black was the same way. I know it seems like it would be funny to watch him act like a teenage girl but it was funny when it was done by Rob Schneider in the Hot Chick. They made the usual jokes you would imagine they would make in that situation. They didn't draw it out in an uncomfortable way but it was touched upon.This was really standard issue stuff slapped with a name that the studio thought would sell and sold it did so we can expect more of this but I;m checking out.

Seriously?"". I'm so glad they proved me wrong!! You should not compare it to the first Jumanji, since this movie stands on its own. There are one or two references but that's all and it's ok. Jumanji now turned into a videogame that sucks players into it. It's not explained how or why this happened, but it's a magical game and if we can believe a stampede can come out of it, we can imagine suddenly turning itself into a videogame as the times changed. The teenagers are pretty much stereotypes, the jock, the nerd, the popular blond and the shy one. But once they are in the game, they change. The movie used this change for comedy and surprisingly, it works great!! Dialogues are really funny (and not dumb and cliched, and that's practically a miracle nowadays). Credit goes to the actors who play the videogame characters. They totally make you believe they are the teenagers in those avatars. And the game play is very well done. It's an old school adventure game, where characters have a item box where everything fits, the 3 lives are there, the non-player characters that repeat the same thing, secret passages, hints, the big boss, the map and stuff. It also has a ""smoldering function"" which comes out hilarious on screen. It's not as dark as the first, the animals were more dangerous and Van Pelt was vicious.

The novel concept, brilliant acting & intriguing script made it one of the most entertaining films of the year. People of all ages loved it. Is the new version of the cult favorite as good as the original? 
Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is a story about four high school students placed in detention together, who discover the five player action player called Jumanji. The writers have smartly included all the stereotypical high school students - the nerd, the football star, the babe & the shy bookworm. Everybody who has been through high school thus has that one character they can relate to. They all end up choosing avatars who are polar opposites to their real life identities. Spencer the nerd, chooses Dr Smolder Bravestone - a 6 ft 5 inches tall archaeologist & explorer. Bethany the pretty & self centred cheer leader becomes Sheldon ""Shelly"" Oberon (Jack Black)-a cartographer, a cryptographer, an archaeologist . Football Jock Fridge chooses to become Franklin Finbar(Kevin Hart) - a short zoologist & weapons valet. Bookworm Martha Kaply chooses to become Ruby Roundhouse(Karen Gillan) - a commando, martial arts expert & a dance fighter. They all have three lives. If they lose all their three lives in the game, they actually die in the real world. They all have their strengths & weaknesses. They learn from Nigel, an NPC guide that Van Pelt wants to obtain a Jewel - Jaguar's Eye, which gives him power to manipulate all the animals in Jumanji. It is up to to our four heroes & another character Alex Vreeke - who chooses the character of Jefferson McDonough to return the jewel to the jaguar statue & shout ""Jumanji"". 
The movie kept us entertained throughout & kept us glued to our seats. Some of the situations & dialogues were outright funny. Dwayne Johnson sticks to his strength - action. He has several action packed scenes to showcase his bravado & he doesn't disappoint. Jack Black nails his act of a cheerleader trapped in a obese cartographer's body. Kevin Heart is funny as the short zoologist. His scenes with Dwayne Johnson are hilarious. Karen Gillan is eye candy & plays her part convincingly.
Viewers who haven't seen the original will find the reboot thoroughly entertaining. But those who have seen the original will be a tad disappointed. The anxiety viewers felt every time the characters in the original rolled the dice, could not be replicated in the movie. The board game provided much more fodder for entertainment as compared to the console version. Hence while the board game version became a cult favorite, the new one will be soon forgotten.
We would recommend you to not miss watching the movie at a theatre near you & not miss the 3-D effects. Do take kids along. They will love this one.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

This could have been a disaster, but they pulled a gem-encrusted rabbit out the had for this.Not a remake in any way. Fun fun fun all the way through.Acting great all the way through with perfect amount of cheesiness.It keeps you engaged and event asking questions about ""what if they did that?""
Suspense till the end and nice finish.We saw this accidentally when our intended movie was sold out and actually think we got the better deal.Loved it!",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
388,Christina-Q,This is a bad remake of the classic,3,17 November 2019,"I'm a fan of Robin Williams and I really liked his Jumanji. Even with all the clumsiness and bad CGIs. I have watched it many times, when I was a kid and just rewatched it before watching this. It still is fun and adorable.And to sum it up: this movie destroys all the magic the original had.I liked that they modernized it: changing the platform for the game and having some digital things with them on the game.
And Jack Black is hilarious and is the only interesting thing in this version.
But the rest is not worth it.The acting is mostly very stiff and unrealistic, and the characters start to annoy very fast, and not in a good way. And I can't figure out if The Rock is just bad actor or what is his business.The movie is supposed to be stupid and funny, but I think it is just stupid.
I did like Jack playing a girl, but I felt that they only had like four jokes for him and he had to repeat them over and over again. And the rest of the jokes didn't hit me at all, and I do like comedies.When they are in the game, if feels like forever and lacks tension. Of course the previous Jumanji has its problems too, but it still is cute and funny. This is just bad remake with okay-ish CGIs. I did like the ending, but the actors could've brought something more to it.This wasn't total waste of time, but wouldn't watch this again nor would recommend to anybody.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

391,afortiorama,Funny,7,28 May 2018,"The story is the same as the original. A group of teens get suck into the game and they find someone who was sucked in years before, they have to survive until they get out of the game. The teens are textbook trope characters, so the movie is kind of predictable until they get sucked in the game and their avatars kick in (yes, because nobody plays board games anymore Jumanji gets an update in 1996 when it transforms it self in a video game with avatars instead) and start behaving like their teen counterparts. Kudos to Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Karen Gillan because they are really funny. I wasn't prepared to lauch but there are quite a few scenes that caught me by surprise. I also like the slightly different ending in which the 1996 teen is sent back to his time rather than coming back to a destroyed future.

395,bobandlulureview,Jumanji: Welcome to the Review,9,27 March 2018,"Just as much as I love reading books, I enjoy watching movies too. It's a gene inherited from my parents. 
Now, besides watching movies in the theatres, I record movies on my set-top box and watch it at night, within the comfortable confines of our living room. 
I have new found company for animated films in my five year old. (Though, I really think he comes just for the popcorn). I record movies for Arjun as well and he has now slowly graduated to watching non-animated children's films like Home Alone, Baby's Day Out, Dunston Checks In, Zathura etc. I recently made him watch Jumanji (Part 1) on TV and he seemed to like it. 
And what do you know! Part 2 had hit the theatres. I wasn't even aware of a sequel until I heard it on the radio. I screeched in delight and looked around in the car at the other passengers. My parents had suddenly something very important to discuss and my husband began avoiding eye contact. Arjun looked at me and said ""we'll go driving"". Please note that I have recently started driving and shall do another post reviewing the Alto K10 automatic car. 
I LOVED (still do) Jumanji. I couldn't wait to watch the sequel and dish it. Sequels rarely match up to the original. We went to a nondescript mall closest to our house that had the most convenient timing, post lunch. Not expecting a jam packed theatre, I decided to book tickets at the counter. Bad decision, as the only seats available was at the first row. 
I was a bit disappointed thinking Arjun would have to strain his neck, looking up at the screen, the whole time. We grabbed our 3D glasses. Arjun wasn't pleased with his small ""baby glasses"". Since we'd just had lunch, I had to pull the drooling 5 year old away from the popcorn counter with the promise of cheese popcorn during the ""intermission"". The couple walking towards our seat was wondering why I was giving them dirty looks. They plonked themselves next to us with their gigantic tub of popcorn! (Exaggerated eye-roll) 
Arjun is very loud in theatres. He waits for the theatre to quieten before he can make his proclamation to the public. ""I am very very hungry, you haven't given me anything to eat"" said Arjun looking at our neighbours' popcorn. Thankfully, the screen lit up and the trailers of the upcoming films began. It started off with the Akshay Kumar starrer 'Padman'. The audience drowned in laughter, the trailer was funny. Arjun waited for his moment and loudly asked, ""This is not a Batman, this is a Padman, but what is a Pad?"" Everyone burst out laughing again. Arjun was pleased and with that he forgot his popcorn. 
REVIEW BEGINS HERE: The movie begins with a kid inserting a cartridge into a video game console and my heart sank a little. I have no patience for spotty high school kids and how dare they change the game from a board game to a video game. Are all these millennials too cool for board games!
The movie proceeds with four high school kids being sucked into the game's setting into the world of Jumanji where they don on their respective video game avatars. This is where Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson makes his entry which was met with a lot of hoots and cat calls in the theatre and a ""Why are you screaming now"" from Arjun. The four characters are then enlisted to return the jewel, 'Jaguar's eye' to a gigantic rocky Jaguar statue. The movie follows their journey from their entry into the game all the way up till the statue. The path is trodden with hurdles thrown in by Russel Van Pelt, a hunter, who wants the jewel for himself in order to be able to control the animals of Jumanji. Each player has three lives, losing all of which would mean death. This is a typical action-adventure film and it reminded me of a light hearted version of Hunger Games. 
The 3D effects are superb and the effect was much more pronounced being in the first row. The movie is HILARIOUS, the actors are funny especially Jack Black and Kevin Hart. The five year old had his eyebrows up and mouth wide open so I am presuming he enjoyed it too. At the risk of sounding unfaithful to Robin Williams, Dwayne did an excellent job as the protagonist, Dr. Smolder Bravestone. 
Yes, I would record this movie when it comes on TV and watch it again.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Jumanji - Welcome to the jungle.,9,3 January 2018,"So...Jumanji - Welcome to the jungle.***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***I totally loved the original Jumanji, can't believe it's over 20 years old! I remember watching the herd of rhino crashing through the town centre and being incredibly impressed with the CGI and all that nonsense, and it was actually touching how Robin Williams' family had suffered after his disappearance. Was a great film and I re-watched it recently in preparation for this sequel and it is still an excellent film.I really liked this new movie - it's very well made, quite funny and superbly paced. Loved it. If (like me) you've ever played D&D then this is about as close as you'll ever get I suppose. Anyone who has played a Computer game or RPG should love it and let's face it that's quite a big market.Karen Gillen is particularly good, after such small roles in Guardians of the Galaxy she deserved a more prominent role. Jack Black is excellent and the Dwayne The Rock is, um just the Rock with more asides than usual.Some awesome CGI and imaginative camera work really made this film for me. It did deserve a slightly better polish on the script and some of the plot points could have done with a nudge, but on the whole I thought it was great. I'd watch it again.But now I need a third part when we discover who made the game and why... Or maybe I don't need a prequel at all and sometimes things can just be because that's how things are.4.5/5 Excellent fun.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

404,MeMyselfOnline,"Different - But Not ""Bad""",7,4 April 2018,"I quite like the first Jumanji film, though it's showing its age these days and so I came to watch this thinking it might be more of the same but updated for new audiences. Instead, they've changed the core concept quite a lot and although I did enjoy the film in its own right, it doesn't really feel like a Jumanji film and lacks the original's imagination.The joy of the first film was seeing the magical jungle world spill out from the game into the real world. In this version, the players are sucked into a video game version, for no real reason whatsoever. But really, the film could have been set around people being sucked into any old game. There was nothing really ""jungle"" about it. Granted, there's a hippopotamus attack early on, but then it's men on motorbikes (??) as the main protagonists? What's jungle about that?Again and again the main adversaries the players come up against are human rather than animal. To my mind it's as though the screenplay was written as a stand-alone film and then someone came up with a last-minute idea to pin the Jumanji brand name on to it. Still, it's an enjoyable enough adventure. I normally can't stand Jack Black but he's fun in this film and actually does a bit of acting. Practically unheard of! And much of the fun is watching adult characters embodying children who are nothing like their avatar selves. Watch it in its own right and you'll probably enjoy it, but don't watch it with the original in mind as it's really very much a stand-alone film.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
405,AngelFall1n,A modern twist on Jumanji,7,22 June 2021,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a good comedy, but that's all there is to it. It's not a sequel to the first Jumanji that I know and grew up with, but more of a modern video-game concept instead of the actual board game. I think it kind of defeats the point of the origin story and why the game was there in the first place. The scenery and costumes were well done. It could have had much potential in regards to the storyline, but the actors still did a great job. Good family comedy film.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

This is the best The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) movie i ever seen since The Rundown (2003). Kevin Hart's also great too. Jack Black was good, Karen Gillan was great too. This movie is the sequel of 1995 of the same film staring Robin Williams, who died in 2014, causing suicide by hanging. I also like Robin Williams since Patch Adams and RV (2006). I haven't seen Mrs. Doubtfire yet, but I will watch it very soon. I also watch the original film, it was the great movie.I wonder don't why people hate this movie because this is not Jumanji. Well, I like this film, it was a funny movie. Just for it, my cousin's sister paid us RM 17 for movie tickets. I laugh this part because Kevin hart ate the cake, causing the explode.This is my favorite film 2017 since Baby Driver, Abang Long Fadil 2, John Wick Chapter 2, Spider-Man Homecoming and Wonder Woman.

However once the movie got going the premise really worked.Jack Black and Kevin Hart really shined in their portrayal of the most popular girl in school and ""Fridge"" the football star respectively.

'Jake, find some whiskey, will you,' he said, and when I came back with Jack Daniel's and shot glasses and started to pour, Grandpa pulled over another stool. 'Make room, men,' he said. 'This might as well be the night.'""Some stories open with an initiation rite-as here did Frank Baldwin, *Jake & Mimi* (New York: Little, Brown & Co., 2002, 161.) In ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" the 1996 night goes to teenage beachcomber Alex (Nick Jonas) after discovering a strange board game in the sand and disappearing when he plays it.""'Nobody misses the war, boy,' he said. 'You understand?' I nodded. ... Every glass of beer was your last. Every letter home. So you got drunk any chance you could. And when you wrote, you made your words count. ... It isn't the war you miss. It's the spirit of those days. Some of us, who got lucky and lived through it, learned how to live. Like we'd be gone tomorrow. Because a lot of us were.' He looked at me. 'You got me, boy?' I nodded. 'Okay, then,' he said gently. ... 'Find something that gives you that charge, Jake. That fires your blood.'"" (Ibid., 164.)Four students at Brantford High School, Spencer the nerd, Fridge the jock, Bethany the fox, and Martha the wallflower, are given detention and admonished to, ""Think about who you are at this moment of time and who you want to be."" Getting bored with their assigned task, they pick up the board game Jumanji and start playing its electronic version.The word *jumanji* can be rearranged thus: break it in two to get Juman-ji. Migrate the 'm' in the middle to the end thus: Juan-Jim. Juan has an alter ego Jim. Each player will discover himself in a game avatar unlike his real life persona. Jumanji having a funny time line, and Alex having a twenty year jump on the others, turns it into a metaphor for living as their adult selves to come, or at least to think about it. As often happens upon graduation the nerd suddenly finds himself in a strong position career-wise, while the football jock's a has-been, to become somebody's lackey. However, in Fridge's case he discovers his calling (zoology), not history that was never his forte. Bethany who was a total manipulator of men now experiences life in a male body, with all its excitable equipment. She'll learn the value of friendship. Martha has game strengths involving martial arts and dancing, good disciplines to develop one's self confidence that was all this babe-in-the-making needed.The game portion of ""Jumanji"" borrows heavily in its graphics from Daniel 2 in the Bible. There was ""a great image... and the form thereof was terrible"" (31). There was a powerful king, ""the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven ... given into thine hand"" (38). In Daniel ""a stone was cut out without hands"" (34) which will eventually smite the image; in ""Jumanji"" a jewel was plucked by hand out of the image's eye socket, which needs to be replaced. The image in Daniel does the same disappearing act as do the Jumanji players when they're transformed: ""like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them"" (35). The story in Daniel 2 represented a great prophesy, but in Jumanji it's just a matter of thinking through life decisions when on the cusp of adulthood. Daniel and his three friends (17) had to interpret the king's dream in order to get themselves out of their ""detention"" unscathed.The story seemed to me pretty juvenile, but then that was the intended audience. The CGI was none too subtle. The tom-toms work well if there's lots of bass in the sound system. The black mamba snake was more realistic in ""Kill Bill"" than in this movie. Spencer comes out with the occasional Yiddishism (""Oy veh!"") Jack Black was adorable playing a female in a male body. Dwayne Johnson struggles to play against type. The rest of the acting was okay; they weren't challenging parts.There are two serpentine lip-action scenes you'll likely want to forget--if you can--of the I've-never-done-this-before variety.

My mom and I were at Target and she grabbed the movie for was to watch. I really didn't want to. We watched it and yes, it was funny on some parts, but kind of boring. I thought the movie is or was going to be a movie for young kids. My 5 year old nephew wants to see Jumanji, but I don't know if I'd let him, unless I or other older kids or adults are with him. Quit a few curse words and something's I don't think he would understand. So, in the end I should have gone with my gut and said lets wait until this comes on TV.

I can't call myself a big fan of the original Jumanji, but it was a very heartwarming movie, while Robin Williams is just impossible not to love. It was one of his movies that used to make you feel a little better about life as a thing. This one, though... I expected it to be a complete joke. Like one of the worst movies ever that will ruin the whole name completely. I hated every second of the trailer. And yet... out of curiosity I decided to see it. And guess what? Surprisingly... it wasn't THAT bad.Actually, they made a sequel (yep, it is not a reboot, it's a direct sequel) and even kept the original heartwarming formula. With how Jumanji may be a scary thing, but it makes players' lives better in the end. It's that exact heartwarming formula and I totally didn't expect that. Here and there it really did feel like they tried to pay some respect to the original. Unfortunately, yes, in the end, it's one of those cheesy movies with a lot of stupid jokes, a lot of stupid action, etc. Where the original Jumanji was more like a soft horror movie with comedy elements, this one is more like a typical action comedy with Rock in spotlight.In other words, even though beginning and the end of the movie do feel like Jumanji, the middle part is pretty different. And I can't really say I liked it. It was OK here and there, but some jokes were way too dirty for such a movie (say whatever you want, but Jumanji should be more like a family movie, jokes about penises and breasts feel totally out of place here), adventure part feels pretty boring (when you think about it, nothing really happens in this movie, just some action on the way to the end), while effects weren't really that cool. I mean, the original Jumanji used to have pretty impressive visuals back in the days. This one... it even looks dated here and there. With $110.000.000 budget they didn't even try to hide cameraman's reflection in Jack Black's glasses. There's also not enough variety. Using those motorcycles again and again... It felt cheap. It actually felt like those cheap old Japanese TV shows. No budget? Get some guys in helmets, put them on bikes and make some action. In this movie 1/3 of action is like that. Feels dated, feels boring and I almost fall asleep during some parts. Which is pretty much a failure for an action part. I can't even name another recent movie that made me fall asleep during the action parts. This one did.I kinda liked how actors did, though. Usually, I can't stand Jack Black (there's something about him that I find extremely unpleasant), but he did pretty good as a part of the team here. And, of course, Karen Gillan (insert joke about Pond in the pond here) was really amazing. Loved her both in action and talking parts. They did really great with Rock. Their scenes are like my favorite. I also liked Morgan Turner. There aren't many scenes with her, but she was able to create a certain mood around her character. Just by certain moves and gestures. It was pretty cute thing to see.But in the end it's a 50/50 to me. Welcome to the Jungle feels like one of those cheesy sequels from 90s. Like, you know. Back in the days, when there was a good and successful movie, there often was a chain of sequels. With the first one that wasn't really that bad yet (the following movies used to become worse and worse progressively), but still, it wasn't even close to the original. In other words, this one isn't Lawnmower Man 2, but it's something like Jaws 2. Not too bad yet, but... not really as good. Kinda fun how in 2017 we've got a cheesy sequel to 1995 movie, but... that's exactly what it is. If you aren't really Karen Gillan's, or Dwayne Johnson's fan, this movie is pretty much skippable. Even for those, who loved the original Jumanji. I certainly don't want it on my shelf, but... I don't really regret paying for a ticket. It was a solid one time movie with a heartwarming ending. Some jokes, some action, a heartwarming ending... Don't expect much, and it can make you a nice evening. But if you want proper Jumanji 2... Sorry, won't happen here.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
422,empire331,Not even close to the original movie,5,2 January 2018,"While not as funny and intriguing as the original movie, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle delivers good visuals, a predictable storyline and a good performance by Jack Black. It's nice to see a remake of the first movie after 20+ years but I still prefer the first one. Mediocre movie not worth seeing more than once.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
423,ssnake_z,Pleasantly Surprised,8,24 August 2019,"JUMANJI: Welcome to the Jungle (2017)
RATING: 3.7/5Well that was a pleasant surprise. Definitely turned out being a lot better than i thought it would. Kevin Hart and The Rock are a good comedy duo, that are probably not going anywhere anytime soon. Jack Black was pretty good, and i actually wish they would have done more with him. Karen Gillen has the potential to be a good comedic actress, if she gets the chance. I remember how good she was on her ""Selfie"" TV show, so i know she has potential, and it's nice to see it used here to a degree.For those that don't know, i majored in Game Design, so it was really interesting for me to see how this movie played with video game tropes. They did a pretty solid job, especially for a video game with no tutorial or instruction manual. For people that don't play video games, this is a pretty decent introduction into the medium, and what you can expect from video games. It's even interesting how you see the characters use the games rules to their advantage, it's actually used in a clever way. Being that Jumanji is a video game, you also get a generic video game bad guy, which was fine because he wasn't the point of the movie. The whole point of Jumanji is to beat the game and get home, so the villain is really just a tool for the game to throw at you.I think what surprised me the most, was the movie's meta narrative choices. It had something to say about your strengths, weaknesses, team work, life. I think the one that hit home the most was the narrative about making the most of the life you have, considering the characters had 3 lives in the game. Yeah, it was semi obvious about it, but it never dwelled on it long enough for you to get annoyed or roll your eyes either. The message really hit home by the time you got to the end of the movie.I never laughed out loud or anything, but i did get some good laughs here and there, and the overall message was definitely a good one. If you want to have a good time at the movies, this holiday season, Jumanji might be the movie for you.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

432,lunalovitt,It was surprisingly good.,9,8 April 2018,"When I first heard they were making a reboot of Jumanji, I was skeptical. These days it seems like everything is getting a half-assed reboot or spinoff so when I went in to watch this movie I didn't expect anything life changing or original. And I was shocked with the results. This story was actually GOOD. It took the original concept that was Jumanji and made its own twists and turns and didn't actually butcher the original source. And I really enjoyed all the characters as well, which is something I couldn't exactly say about the original film. I was so surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie that honestly I find myself wanting to go back and re-watch it. When it comes to movies starring comedians, I don't really get very hopeful about the content and quality of the movie, especially these days when ""comedians"" turn out to mostly rely upon profanities and slap stick more than wit and actual humor. However, the jokes in this movie were on point and I really enjoyed Kevin Hart's performance as well as Dwayne Johnson's. They played well off one another and it wasn't over the top. And wow... I really did think Jack Black had hit the high point of his career back in Kung Fu Panda and was on the down slope, but he was easily one of the best parts of this movie. The casting for this movie was great overall.
 
Not only that, but this movie was more than the typical ""comedy"" movies you see nowadays that are all about getting drunk/spitting out as many curse words in a sentence as possible/being ""shocking"". There was a serious plot behind it with actual stakes and it played its serious moments very well. All of the characters went through important evolutions that were believable by the end of the film. Now, it wasn't perfect. There are things that were a bit off in terms of continuity and if you know the first Jumanji then you might see where I'm getting at, but it wasn't enough to take away from the film itself. Overall this was a very enjoyable movie and I'd definitely watch it again. The movie was a tasteful update to the Jumanji franchise, and to be honest I'd love to see if they have plans for a sequel. I'd certainly watch it given how well they treated this movie.Then again, I did watch Pitch Perfect 3 in the same night as this one, so this positive review might be a little biased when taking in both movies side by side in a short period of time.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
433,terrsgc,This movie is FUN. I recommend it with no restrictions.,9,3 January 2018,"Unlike most reviewers seem to feel, I like this movie a little better than the original Jumanji, which was an excellent movie. Both are silly, of course. You have to suspend disbelief a lot. This is unavoidable with the genre. All of our protagonists are flawed but like-able enough that you care if they die. Granted, deep-down you know that it is unlikely for the primary characters to permanently die, but on the surface you can't help but think, ""just maybe ..."". And, the multi-life game limit allows you to watch them suffer some horrible fates, anyway.Another complaint I read a lot has to do with Karen Gillian's attire. She's dressed like Lara Croft Tomb-Raider. Get over it. Her cheeks aren't hanging out of her shorts. Her cleavage isn't showing. Yes, her midriff shows, but I see far skimpier walking around the neighborhood often enough in the summer time, and far FAR skimpier at the beach. Is it appropriate for a jungle? Probably not. But, then that's the joke, isn't it? She's a character straight out of a 90's video game. The action scenes are fun, the comedy is fun, the location exotic enough. The game plot is as inane as the typical 90's video game, which it should be. What's not to like? And, I see nothing that most parents should find objectionable, with the possible exception of a curse word and some very minimal potty humor.This movie does what it is supposed to. It entertains me for the duration of the film. And, it does it well. I don't recommend this movie as some great work of art that will win any awards. It's just FUN. Enjoy it and let the critics be critical.Note: I removed the spoiler warning. I don't believe I've revealed anything that isn't in the trailers anyway.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

440,amerbajramovic,I expected a funnier Jungle,7,27 January 2018,"To be honest and just as I said in the title of my review, I expected a much funnier comedy. And if this ain't a comedy then what is whit all that effort to make it funny.
First of all, casting Dwayne and Kevin together could be an enormous hit just by seeing them side by side. It is like David and Goliath on the same team. They did managed to do that to a certain point but it could have been done even better. Another bummer was that maybe even the funniest scene, one during the bladder unloading, was a total nonsense. The collage girl who doesn't know how a penis works? Really convincing.
I couldn't help myself and to close my eyes on all that CGI they did on animals. I really think it could have been done with at least one real, trained animal (jaguars for example). And as in almost every single movie today, they couldn't make it through without some stupid calls and mindless mistakes.
Other than this and maybe few minor complains and big predictability, I actually liked the movie. They made it look like a real-deal video game, they had some hard muscles for women and some cheeky curves for man, great action and heart-pumping scenery, beautiful landscapes and of course some pretty amusing and funny moments. 
To conclude it all, a movie worth of watching, probably a bigger amusement for kids then for us a bit older ones.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

442,MatthewCherrier,Surprisingly awesome ... with 1 exception,8,19 September 2019,"As a child of the 90's I loved the original movie so I was very nervous when this remake was announced. But I found the movie to be fun & fresh while still keeping the spirit of the original, it's a great balance of humor, adventure & action with an intriguing story. Jack Black is by far the best & funniest character, he totally nails the part as a self absorbed teenage girl, yet brings something real to the character so she's not just your basic ""popular high school girl"" we've seen 1,000 times. Where Black brought depth to his stereotypical character Kevin Heart did the opposite, he played the high school jock character just as that, an arrogant jock who thinks he deserves everything handed to him. He's completely unlikeable & compared to the others his acting skills definitely need some work, he tries way too hard to stand out while the others shine effortlessly. I'm not typically a fan of the Rock's movies but his portrayal of a vulnerable nerdy kid stuck in this hyper masculine body is well rounded & believable, I was pleasantly surprised by his performance. Karen Gillian is the perfect as Ruby Roundhouse & has what is probably the funniest scene in the movie, her ""sexy flirting"" with the soldiers followed by her then kicking their asses is hilarious & awesome at the same time, it really sums up her entire character. Overall it's a fun movie I highly recommend, would be a 10 if it wasn't for Heart's performance.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

445,laszlo-05700,Classic teen movie for the next generation,6,22 March 2018,"I had no high expectations towards the Jumanji sequel and to be honest, I never though the original was some milestone cult movie either. It was a cute Robin Williams film aimed at the youth, and I think it delivered just that. However I had a fun 2 hours watching the new Jumanji, and I think it's a well produced and highly entertaining piece even despite it's weaknesses.Let's start with the script: it's very well put together - the idea of reproducing Jumanji for a 2017 set doesn't sounds easy at all, but the writer's didn't take much risk and chose to turn the board game into a video game. That eliminated the chance of mediocre teen acting and too much ""teenager"" elements, because for some reason teens nowadays don't like movies with teens. They like Dwayne Johnson action scenes, and they got just that.As for Mr. Johnson - I think despite all his bad movies, he is a very talented and skilled actor, he won't let down people in Jumanji either. Kevin Hart's OK as well. But when it comes to other members of the cast I think it was just too difficult for some roles to be reproduced authentically. I'm not saying overacting shouldn't be a part of a movie like that - you can tell that Jack Black totally tried to do what s(he) was supposed to do, but the difference between a genius and dumb character is very narrow here, it's hard to tell if he did good or not. But the point of Jumanji is not collecting Oscar awards, so that won't ruin anyone's career, none had to prove how fantastic actors they are, the goal was to provide entertainment to the viewers, which they succeeded in.Also, there are some funny pop-cultural references in the movie, which might be good jokes even for adults, but to be honest, there are so many aspects in which it delivers only ""mediocre"", that the 2017 Jumanji surely won't be as memorable as the original one.

452,suspiria77,A great surprise,7,9 April 2018,"I am happy to say the new Jumanji is an absolute delight from start to finish. All of the actors are excellent but Jack Black truly shines as a high school girl trapped in, well, Jack Black's body. The action and special effects are thrilling, but the movie really shines in the comedy and the chemistry between the cast.A really smart choice on the filmmaker's part was to take the time at the beginning of the movie to establish the characters of the four main teenagers, so much so that when they enter the video game you still feel like you are watching those four characters even as they have been replaced by their more famous counterparts, which is a testament to the acting of those four stars.This taking time at the beginning makes the first act a little bit light on the action, but it makes up for that once our hapless heroes arrive in the world of Jumanji. The helicopter sequence in particular is a standout, one that left my five year old quite literally on the edge of her seat.The film is also funny, very, very funny. Jack Black has had a rough stretch of bombs and has been almost forgotten in recent years, but he absolutely takes over this movie in sections, reminding us of his considerable comedic talent. This is not to take away anything from the rest of the cast, who all have great moments, the banter between Johnson and Hart is fantastic, and Gillan's dance fighting is a particularly enjoyable moment as well.While it can be said that the happy ending and the main characters never seem truly in danger throughout the film, I don't think anyone is going to see this film for realism or for an unhappy resolution so it's hard to fault it for that.

The story is so strong for a nice film but I am afraid they could not use correctly. Although visual effects are not outstanding if you want to choice like fantastic movie. Seems like producer did not want to spend money for this movie I sense an intense lack of quality and cheapness. Character introduction is pretty crucial in movies like this because we watch a loser men-women and apparently they improve themselves with time but I didn't take proper information before the action especially for girl. And then suddenly plot point 1 was over, they included the game. After that time during 20 minutes we watch the sexy girl joke. The story is never going on in that times. After the first scenes of motorbiker guys we watch billions of scenes which are trying to make epic. Al the time with increasing music sound, somebody explore himself and decide to become self-confident person, 5 minutes later again I watch the same thing . At least 4-5 scenes are like this. I have never watched a regularly rising of character story. Because of this reason I don't feel any signal of victory before the resolution part of script.Frankly, I like the game-inside point only.

It deserves and 8/10 for it's fun but is definitely a 6/10 film.It was a fun adventure film and I can't help but think that this would be reviewed favorably if it did not have the Jumanji name attached. This is a fact that does annoys me, and impacted my expectations.The first act of the film is dull, a clear rip off of the Breakfast Club, and gives the convoluted reason why this is a Jumanji film. Unfortunately, the first characters introduced are one dimensional and unlikable , you can see their arc from miles away. The film picks up quickly once our ""heroes"" finally gets to Jumanji and is the turning point. In testament to the setup, the characters do retain their traits throughout the movie, which was a shock considering the caliber of actors in the film, sorry Dwayne.This film succeeds due to it's comedy, which is on point for the most part and is driven by Jack Black. It was also helped by the fact that Kevin Hart is subdued, a wise decision as he is typically insufferable. Jack Black is finally back to his best, as he has been poor for many years and is the stand out part of the movie.The plot of the film is ludicrous and full holes, merely there to support the comedy but you don't mind as the comedy is spot-on. The action is acceptable and keeps the viewer engaged for the most part.This film is not a work of genius and doesn't pretend to be and is partly the reason it works. It doesn't have interesting visuals, a complex plot, terribly great acting but it is excellent fun and I would recommend to anyone looking to fill 2 hours.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

462,RockoDaFoxxo,Probably one of the best video-game movies ever made...,4,6 January 2018,"But that's barely saying anything, 'cause video game movies have a weird tendency to be really sh***y. Thankfully, Jumanji video game movie was better than I expected.I don't have that much memories of the original besides scaring me as a kid, so this review is not fan-based. The trailers for this one didn't grab me, but because I'm spending time in Utah with family members over Christmas break we decided to see Welcome to the Jungle. Overall it's a fine, fun bit of fluff that probably won't stick with your memory for very long. The film had some clever gags about video games and their levels and how an AI character repeat the same sentences unless you say something important. The action is serviceable. The cast has a lot of chemistry, and Jack Black nails it in every scene he's in. Even if the Instagram-obsessed girl with no phone joke gets old fast. Kevin Heart annoys me, and this didn't change my mind. :-\The story is pretty simple: make it outta the game by returning this to that and beat all the levels. It's a pretty fun concept, and the film does have it's creative moments. But the humor is a mixed-bag. Sometimes it's funny, and sometimes it's childish and pays out far too long. There are some decent character moments, but overall there's not much emotional investment or stakes. It's just like a video game: it doesn't focus on character development too much, just making it to the next obstacle. And for that alone, it's exciting and entertaining enough.Maybe I'm missing out some of the fun when picking all these flaws, but I do know that Welcome to the Jungle was fine far what it is. It's amusing, sometimes funny, at times creative and always action-packed. It doesn't want to be a masterpiece and never tries to reach beyond what it is. I smiled, but quickly forgot about a lot of scenes. Maybe I'm too snobbish to enjoy anything, but can we at least agree that this was one of Sony's best films of 2017?! I mean, they've made Emoji Movie which felt more like a dull advertisement than anything else. At least this didn't feel like a full-on cash-grab.5.5 or 6/10.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

466,Alanaji_16,"""JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE"" - MY REVIEW",7,6 February 2018,"Jumanji: Welcome to the jungle, directed by Jake Kasdan, is an action adventure movie and by no means a direct sequel to the original Jumanji movie released in 1997.
The plot of the film is about four High school teenagers, who while serving detention, comes across the video game and get sucked into it. By doing so they adopt their own 'Avatars' and have to complete the mission given to them to safely reach home.
Director Jake ensures that the audience are entertained throughout the film. The highlights of the movie are it's action, Cinematography and a bunch of good actors. But the film is not without it's share of flaws. The villain's role could have been more tight. That might have made the movie a bit more thrilling. 
Now to the performances. The characters in the game were just enjoyable. Dwayne Johnson works well in the action scenes as well as in the comedy. Kevin Hart was terrific. Kareen Gillan was good especially in the action scenes. Jack Black was sidelined even though he was good in some scenes. The actors in the real world did'nt have much of a role but have made their presence felt. Bobby Cannavale ( Villain), as I mentioned before, could have been provided with a more good role.
All in all Jumaji:Welcome to the jungle, is a fun ride with well excecuted action scenes and witty one liners. Just give it a shot and u won't be dissapointed.

474,raa-55017,"No Masterpiece, but Stupid Fun",7,28 December 2017,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) is a sequel/reboot to the 1995 Jumanji, starring Robin Williams. This new version boasts an all-star cast -- starring Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillian -- and tells the story of four teenagers who get trapped in the video game ""Jumanji"" and must work together in order to escape the game. Walking into this I had zero expectations whatsoever. The trailers didn't win me over at all, and the entire premise seemed pretty dumb to me. However, walking out, I was pretty satisfied with what I had just seen, even though the film is incredibly stupid and requires all suspension of disbelief. Jumanji is in no way a great movie, so let's begin with the flaws. The CGI is not the best, and there is an over reliance it. There are lots of moments and scenes where it is blatantly obvious that the actors are monologuing to a green screen, and the CG around them was pretty bad. I didn't particularly enjoy the first 20 minutes of the film, where the main characters are all teenagers in high school before they enter the video game. I found the beginning slow and pretty cringy, and the actual Jumanji setting is far better. Also the villain was extremely weak, and the plot itself was pretty predictable. Despite these flaws, I enjoyed Jumaji overall. The film knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else. By far the best thing about this movie is its fun sense of comedy and escapism. Jack Black does a phenomenal job depicting an Instagram-addicted teen, and the entire cast is very well written. They all have moments and funny dialogue, and the film kept me entertained for a solid 2 hours and laughing quite a lot. Jumanji has it's problems, but was a pretty fun experience.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

476,chestern-80136,"Ambitious, but ultimately fell short",5,6 January 2018,"Before I start this review, I feel I must preface it quickly. I have never seen the original 1995 release (I was only born in 1999) so I can't comment on any links it may share with the 2017 addition. Also, I watched it in a 4D showing, and as a result, I may have missed certain elements due to being tossed around etc. With that aside, I shall proceed. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is an interesting, if seemingly confused film. Directed by Jake Kasdan, the film seems uncertain as to what it wants to be. Upon googling the genre, one can find five listed by the search engine: Action, adventure, comedy, fantasy and Family. Already, that's a handful. Romance subplots are also attempted, in addition to moments which seem to be attempting to invoke horror. Despite it's 12A rating, it seemed determined to squeeze as many curse words as they could, and while there was very little actual blood, the violence was cranked up as far as they dared. You see a man get mauled by a hippopotamus, another erupt into an explosion, a gunshot wound etc. I feel it's rather safe to say it attempted to please everybody. In doing so, it's failed to please me. I would much rather a film focus on a few things and excel, rather than trying to do everything and winding up mediocre at best.Boasting a very respectable 77% on rotten tomatoes, at first glance it may seem that i'm the minority in my low to middling opinions on the film. Upon further examination, however, it seems that many critics were instead rather uninterested by the film. Currently, it's average critic rating is a 6.1. This doesn't mean it's a bad film by any means, but it instead shows how the 'Tomatometer' can occasionally be misleading. Were it rated at a 5.9, I believe the film would no longer be eligible for a fresh rating, let alone the 'certified fresh' it has received.Overall, I feel the main issue was the writing. I feel very little effort was put into the writing, particularly regarding the dialogue. Much of it felt clumsy, and painfully cheesy at times. It was so distracting that at one point my sister, who had seen (and enjoyed) the film at a previous date, leaned across to let me know I might cringe at the next scene. for myself personally, I didn't find it any more painful that the rest of the film. For other viewers, however, it may be an issue.The performances, overall, were actually one of the stronger points of the film. While the actors had to deal with the previously mentioned poor dialogue, many of the actors were able to do their job well. Jack Black, though I found his character infuriating at times, was consistent, and the audience I was with seemed to enjoy his antics. Karen Gillan portrayed a shy teenage girl notably well, and I was even pleasantly surprised by Nick Jonas (yes, I had to google which brother it was). Jonas's character of Alex was even given a mature, bittersweet ending. Without spoiling specifics of the film, his character's end was different to the rest of the team. Unfortunately, it also raised some questions about the other character's conclusions, and the specific rules within which this world operates. Regardless of the confusion, I also found the ending unsatisfying, and feel the film would have benefited by cutting off the last three minutes or so.Many of the CG effects were rather disappointing, that may be attributed to the budget. Hiring a handful of big-name stars presumably took a big chunk from the $100 million or so budget. The animals looked poor at times, and some of the CGI stunts were lacklustre, rather ironically looking more at home in a video game. Additionally, the villain was entirely forgettable. Bobby Cannavale's portrayal wasn't bad, the writing just made him feel almost entirely useless. The plot would have worked just as well if he wasn't present.With this being said, many of the shots were actually quite impressive. The one that stood out to me was quite a simple one. At one point in the film, a row of torches light up through the jungle. Though simple, the contrast between the blazing torches, and the inky blackness of the jungle at night was truly impressive, particularly due to the staggered ignition of the flames. It seemed as though the pathway was carving itself through the trees when the film cut to a wider shot.Overall, I found this film a real mix. Ultimately, out of ten, I feel I have to give it a five. That isn't to say it's a consistent, comfortable five, however. At times, the film sinks to a three. At others, the moments you'd go to see the film for, it raises to perhaps a seven. I'm simply giving what I feel would be an average for the film as a whole. If you're a fan of the cast, I'd imagine you'll enjoy the film; both Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart barely seem to be playing characters, and while I don't particularly enjoy them, they have good chemistry and work well off of each other. Obviously, if you're looking for a serious film with a strong moral, this film isn't for you; it ultimately boils down to 'be happy with yourself'.

479,mcisneros-64809,Jumanji is not a video game!,6,5 July 2021,"It was very obvious from the trailer and beginning of the movie that Kevin Hart and Johnson would be the ones leading the film. But I think the very essence of Jumanji was destroyed. It was supposed to be a board game, not an RPG. There is no gathering resources, there is no ""boss"" or quests to be completed properly. The feminist agenda surrounding Gillan felt flat and unauthentic, falling into a lame copycat of Black Widow. And why Kasdan decided to go with Jack Black´s feminine/gay stereotype?. After all, it is just a good movie full of action and some boring jokes, but the whole ""trapped in a videogame"" genre has already burned out.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
480,bottomsgaming,"The rare reboot that has heart, respects the original, and has some new, funny ideas.",7,2 January 2018,"If you've seen the trailers, you know the drill. The terrifying jungle board game from the '90s is back, capturing kids and forcing them to play its game. A game whose rules are seemingly made up and always stacked against the unfortunate players. Except this is the 2017 version! Since no one plays board games anymore (shame), this one is going to be a video game, and the kids will assume avatars played by The Usual Suspects of comedy actors.I know, I'm making it sound lame, because that's honestly what I thought it would be after seeing the trailer. It looked like another lifeless reboot, complete with enough popular actors to make a few hundred mil, rinse, and repeat in a couple years.What I got was a pleasant surprise.For starters, the movie is hilarious. The cast is terrific together, which is expected with the talent, but even more importantly, the jokes (as well as the story) are actually well written. We know that The Rock, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan can be funny. But when given proper material and enough room to do their thing and let chemistry develop, as they are here, they're pretty hilarious together.What's refreshing is the fact that the actors get to play caricatures that are slightly outside their normal baseline. After the story sets up the kids' characters (which are fairly generic), we're quickly sent to Jumanji where the adults take over for a remainder of the movie, and they don't miss a beat with these characters. The highlight is Jack Black, who steals the show with a few different gut-busting scenes, but everyone is comfortable in their off-centered roles.While most of the gags do play off of these watered down caricatures, both the writing and acting are deft enough to keep things funny and interesting. The characters evolve through the jokes as they become more comfortable with each other, as well as who they are, both in Jumanji and the real world. It's really a nice treat. Lesser written comedies would create the caricatures, half-ass some obvious jokes, and do nothing besides hit all of the usual beats on the way to a nice paycheck. The early moments of this film actually have some decent set ups that pay off later, evolve the characters, and deliver an appropriate amount of crassness without ever becoming cringe-worthy. There are also some really clever moments that play off of common video game tropes. Again, this doesn't work without good delivery from the cast, and we get A+ comedy performances for what the script needs.The film does fall into a few of the common traps. The story seems to think its audience has no attention span whatsoever. Characters recap their journey after every action scene in far too much detail than is necessary, going over obvious plot points that everyone has already heard multiple times. In addition to this, the movie really goes out of its way to try to describe how video games work to the audience in way too much detail.There are multiple scenes where we have to stop for exposition into how video game lives work, how video games have levels, etc. This includes characters bafflingly repeating things we have already been told, like when a character explains to the villian, ""My weakness is venom,"" before taking advantage of that exact fact. We don't need this. I understand that some people may find this stuff useful, and I get it's a family movie. But when 90% of the target audience already knows stuff the characters spend 15 minutes explaining throughout the movie, it's probably stuff that could have been omitted.This ties in to the dialogue, which outside of the comedy itself, is fairly uninspired. During many scenes (action scenes especially), characters will often just announce what is happening on screen as though there will be people listening to the movie on the radio. Characters also don't really have any dialogue outside of the scope of their colorless caricatures. This leads to many conversations that play out similarly, if not identically, throughout the movie. Again, the comedy that's often attached to these lines works more often than not, but as the movie goes on, the dialogue gets increasingly pointless.Overall, the movie works. It's funny mostly the whole way, and at times, it's downright hilarious. The story clearly had some effort put into it, even if it's not perfect. The cast, however, is as close to perfect as you can get. Jack Black and Kevin Hart are the standouts, but everybody has great chemistry, and this allows the characters and story to remain entertaining the whole way.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a worthwhile reboot/sequel. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a comedy.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Ok back on the Topic..The movie starts from the Last scene of Jumanji and with continuous Adventure story line. The Jumanji title is playing the good role and makes you powered when yelled in Last Scene.Positives are - The based on modern type of Video Game rather than thos Board Games it has played well in almost all the Scenes and like there feeling too. In real 3d effects cant be felt in most scens and you just really feel the Situation.Ahh and Dwyne Jhoson! WHoa. He is the main focused character and as always played best role .
Again the Friendly pair of Dwyne and Kevin's here with great Punches and all the movie is in the Jungle (Obviously title suggests)A bit of Love
Comedy...
Humors ...
and....
Most of Adventure is there because Dwyne Fallen in LOVE! what?
Some negative..
Ah It has no riddles to solve the Game .. yeah it has but not to big that make a viewer to think - ""Shit! Why I didn't think this?"" And just some complicated puzzels and extras.. Some line Holograms, Bonus Points , Levels, Map Discussion, Missions, Ands some game like experiences.
I we recall the Zathura , How twisted movie was that!! And also not Forgetting Jumangi 1985.
Light twists but not big and it is simply for Fun and Entertainment ...

482,austindickerson-03813,WTH was this?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,1,16 July 2018,"I had one of the worst theatrical experiences I've ever had in my life seeing this. This is even worse than the original film from 1995! I absolutely cannot stand this franchise at all!! Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, and Jack Black had their careers abused because of this! This is why Sony Pictures has gone absolutely downhill ever since The Emoji Movie and the Flatliners remake. They thought they could improve more after releasing Blade Runner 2049, but no. They got high again. There was this one scene in the large shed where there was a plane. And those douchebags were coming for Karen Gillan. She did a disruptive dance that made me offended. Plus, there were bugs going in characters' ears. I just wanted to vomit blood so hard because of what I saw. I even wanted to let my anger out in the theaters. But no, there were some people in the room laughing theirselves off. I was the only one in the room that didn't even LAUGH. Because this movie was not even funny!! Was this experience worse than Alvin & The Chipmunks: Chipwrecked? Yes. It's worse than Alvin & The Chipmunks: Chipwrecked. This probably is the second worst time seeing a movie in theaters. My first worst is Maleficent. This movie was even worse than all four of the Spy Kids movies. And that's another franchise that critics like that flipping sucks. This had tons of fart jokes and inappropriate stupidity that doesn't even make any sense at all. What is so funny about fart jokes?!?! NOTHING!!!!!! I would've been happy if this franchise would die already. Sony, do me a favor and don't even make a third movie. If you do, it better get extreme negativity on Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, and Metacritic. And it better bomb at the box office. It better kill the franchise. So yeah. All I can say is (bleep) this movie. I am NEVER seeing it ever again. I don't even wanna look at this movie ever again. Better yet, I don't even wanna look at this franchise anymore. If you are a fan of those actors and actresses that starred in this, don't even watch it!

The average person shouldn't be going around watching movies which have no original ideas, I mean you look at something like suicide squad, a great movie btw, and you realize that nothing like that has never been done before. I mean everything about it was original and compared to jumango, or what ever the name for this movie is, you realize that it is just a movie trying to be funny by reusing every joke ever heard.

The Rock may not be a great actor, but he saves it with utter charm, and Jack Black as a teenage girl could have gone wrong in so many ways, but it just works.

493,Sophie_89,Absolutely hilarious from start to finish!,9,1 January 2019,"When i first started watching this I thought I can't sit through two hours of these incredibily annoying teenagers, but then they changed into other characters when they got sucked into the game. I loved how they were all polar opposites of themselves in real life - the nerdy girl became a hot, high-kicking warrior, the nerdy guy became The Rock, the massive football player became the weedy side-kick and, in my opinion, the funniest of them all, the self-obsessed beauty queen became Jack Black! My jaw hurt from laughing so much at Jack Black playing a selfie-obsessed teenage girl! The adult actors were believeable in their portrayals of both their teenage characters and their characters in the Jumanji game. I'm always sceptical of these remakes of classic films but this one did not disappoint, thank you for not ruining the original!",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
494,bratxja,Ju-Johnson,7,31 December 2017,"There are some moments, when you don't expect nothing, but get something. For me this moment is Jumanji. I found out about the movie in 5 minutes before I went to watch. It was like ""Hi, are we going to watch Jumanji? Oh, you don't know nothing about it? Ok, I give you 5 minutes to watch trailer"". 
So, new Jumanji was totally unexpected for me and I had no bad feeling about film. Jumanji is movie from my childhood, although not the most beloved. And not in the top 10 too. And I have one sin - normal attitude to remakes. Not good, normal.Plot and conceptThis is re-write of old story with modern environments. If you are expecting interesting plot - goodbye. Why did you even think about such things? The movie is for children (sorry, children), with many action and with Dwayne Johnson (sorry, Dwayne). 
Main characters (four pupils) isn't main at all. This is the key plot twist. And only. Other story is simple. Our not main characters play Jumanji' video-game. They was teleported (transformed? terraformed?) as a playing heroes and this for our good. Really, the not main characters is so typical and boring: dumb sportsman, nerd, glamorous girl and shy (but beautiful and smart, of course!) girl. I even can't remember their names. But! There is a plot twist. In the Jumanji they being as gaming characters - Dwayne Johnson (hero without weaknesses), Kevin Hart (comedian character, what else can you expect from him? Did you see his movie list?), Jack Black (another comedian character) and Karen Gillan (besides, the most powerful character - her name Martha! Superman and Batman out of the game!)
Now you can imagine that each pupil got not very suitable game character. This is one of the pillars of the comedian side of movie. However, it was such a relief when Johnson didn't speaks in a teenager' voice. I was at fear before his first words. Another plot is boring and predictable. Really, adventures, some sympathy and love, jokes about penis (girl in the man's body) and so on, so on, so on. Dwayne Johnson rocks!And if you love Johnson, then you totally must see movie. He is another pillar of the film. Playing the nerd in a muscular body quite good. Dwayne Johnson play always Dwayne Johnson for me. This is problem of many action's actors (salut, Vin Diesel!). But in this case it is suitable. 
Another main characters... yes, they exist. Can't say, that they are boring or not interesting. But on the Johnson' background not so shining. Good. It is word.So, if you like some light action without interesting and deep story, but with many comedy moments - new Jumanji for you. Especially, if you like this bald guy. 
This is not a movie of the year. But you will get few delightful moments for your evening.

496,ailishcrombie,So much fun for everyone!,9,31 January 2018,"I am a huge fan of the original movie so with the hype surrounding the movie, I had my doubts. However, I haven't laughed as hard as I did watching Jumanji: into the jungle for a long time!There was joke after joke at poor Mr Hart's expense and the Rock was one of the standout performers. Shout out also to Karen Gillen who's karate and roundhouse kicking skills were on point. There were also mention-able cringe moments such as the most awkward on screen kiss between the rock and Karen, the most awkward flirting scene (Karen again) and the most awkward 'how to pee' scene featuring Jack black.The modern approach to the once board game was very well explained and elaborated and very suited to today's times. The threats and the perils in the movie were just as exciting as in the original and I liked that they kept the theme of kids growing up whilst playing the game from the first movie. In fact the plot overall was just as good as the first one and a solid tribute to Robin Williams. I really enjoyed myself and know that everyone who watches it will as well.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

499,MaxHuskins,Modern Interpretation of a Childhood Classic,7,27 December 2017,"I was sceptically excited and scared upon the announcement of this sequel since the original movie has always been close to my heart and was a fond part of my childhood.Going in, I wasn't quite sure how ""Welcome to the Jungle"" was going to tie itself into the universe and if I would like the new direction. It could've easily been an awful disaster, but I am happy to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this modern interpretation of Jumanji.
This movie knows exactly what it is and doesn't take itself too seriously, has good pacing and the perfect balance of action to character development. I was also surprised to see the amount of attention to detail, every plot is resolved by the end of the movie along with a majority of questions that you could ask. I thought the concept of the characters was interesting and unique and was utilized very well.Additionally, if you've spent the past 22 years wondering what happened at the beach after the credits of Jumanji rolled, worry not, you will get your answer.This sequel/spiritual successor has the perfect amount of nods and tie-in's into the original lore and handles that mission just as good as Jurassic World.Overall a good action adventure story with a moral purpose and a core message.This is a fun pop-corn filled roller-coaster ride for any age. It's the kind of movie that you can join mid-way while flipping through the channels and stay tuned until the end. It doesn't quite have the magic of the original but maybe that's just because I'm getting old or maybe it's because the one and only Robin Williams isn't with us anymore.You definitely can't go wrong with this one so feel free to take your kids/girlfriend/family to go see it. I promise you that you won't hate it as much as Star Wars (but that's a review for next week).I give ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" a solid 7.5 out of 10.P/S 
The original Jumanji is actually criminally under-rated and somehow holds a minuscule 50% on Rotten Tomatoes.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
500,niallmaggs,Great comedy and cast - Film review by Niall Maggs (http://ateenstakeonfilm.com),9,5 January 2018,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a (apparent) sequel to the 1995 classic Jumanji starring Robin Williams, surrounding a mysterious board game. The 2017 film has the same premise, except this time it's not a board game, but a video game from the 90's.Four students at a school receive detentions for different reasons, and end up together having to staple booklets. Spencer (Alex Wolf) discovers an old video game called 'Jumanji', the students set up the game and play it, but end up being sucked in, turning them into the form of the characters they chose. Spencer's character takes the form of Dwayne Johnson. The other characters actors' consist of Karen Gillan, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black. From here onwards, there is non stop fun, action, great humour, and a glorious soundtrack!The premise here really works well. The plot takes unexpected twists and turns that keeps the audience on their toes. But what makes it thrive, is the great chemistry between the actors, in particular Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart; this type of chemistry can't be scripted. The one liners exchanged between both are hilarious and they work really well together. We'll definitely be seeing these two together in more movies in the future. It's not just these two that have great chemistry, Karen Gillan and Jack Black also really fit in with Johnson and Hart. All of them each have their own style and bring something different to the crew, Whether it's Johnson's charisma, Hart's comedy or Gillan's striking looks, there is something for everybody to enjoy in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.And trust me, Karen Gillan isn't just there for her beauty, she's hilarious and a vital asset to the rest of the team. All of her scenes are memorable, whether she's dancing to Big Mountain's Baby, I Love Your Way while beating soldiers up, or taking flirting advice from Jack Black, she's constantly the star among the popular likes of Dwayne Johnson, which demonstrates her strength as an actor if she can outdo The Rock! Her performance is brilliant, and the video game character is a complete opposite to the real life Martha, played by Morgan Turner. In real life she's shy, anxious and unpopular. However in the game she's a complete badass! The way the filmmakers handled each character is really great. The tough Spencer is a nerdy guy in real life. Completely different to Fridge (Kevin Hart) who is a strong, tough, popular football player, but in the game, he's quite cowardly, small and weak. This aspect I really liked.Henry Jackman's score is used really effectively. Every scene benefited with the heart pounding music. In particular, there is a lot of sequences where the tension and suspense is just incredible. The score also resembles the whole jungle premise, making the scenes feel real and not just seem like a movie set. The sound still stayed a reasonable volume and you can still hear the dialogue. In a lot of films, the booming sound is unpleasant, but in Jumanji the music is a great addition to the already-intense scenes.The action was almost non stop. You're on the edge of your seat constantly and there is a great supply of thrills. The action direction was also very good. The lack of shaky-cam worked well, and even when it was used, the scene wasn't ever jarring or jerking. The sequences stayed enjoyable and you CAN actually see what's going on. These types of scenes were also shot brilliantly and the cinematography was simple but effective.There were some instances where a couple of scenes went on for too long however, and the runtime could've been shortened by about fifteen minutes. The pace was also sometimes clunky and jumpy. It rushes the ending but spends too long on a couple of scenes in the second act. However, the majority of the film stays consistent and smooth.There is also a lack of character development, and there are no real arcs to follow. We don't see any of the characters change throughout except for the end scene, but there is no gradual shift of attitude toward each other, they just start off disliking each other one moment; then just start loving each other...The film also suffers from a painfully weak villain, who we learn very little about nor do we know why he's there in the first place. He isn't particularly fear inducing or scary, and is just a complete cruel idiot for no reason whatsoever. The climax is also rushed, underwhelming and a slight let-down.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is great fun and the comedy is brilliant and clever. The actors are excellent and their perfect for their role; they're most definitely likeable! The action is great and so's the chemistry between the characters, but does suffer from typical action clichés, however in the end, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is absolutely great!",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Once you are into it, you can't help but notice the stunning visuals; thanks to the Kualoa Ranch private nature reserve, where the movie was filmed. The storyline is excellent, with every detail taken care of - right from how swash plates of a helicopter blade control the pitch of the blades, creating thrust, to how game environments often defy real world physics. The slapstick humour adds to the comical charm of this wonderful movie - a mind freshener for the whole family.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
507,thejacobmello,Behind the Popcorn with Jacob Mello,9,8 February 2018,"Big meets The Breakfast Club meets an awesome ass movie about getting out of the jungle with newly found powers alive! 
I don't know who screwed up and accidently made this movie extremely watchable, but someone dropped the ball big time. It's a sequel/reboot of a robin Williams board game movie, starring The Rock, Jack Black and Kevin Hart. We all knew the score. So, I ask you - which: only got the job because their dad is a producer; over achieving; still believes in the magic of cinema, bastard!, didn't get the memo that this was a simple cash grab, and decided to lay it on the line and make something worth seeing instead?!This movie wasn't revolutionary. It didn't change the course of cinema or alter my perspective on reality. Instead it did the one thing I hope for every time I sit down for a movie in this genre - It entertained. For the two hours I sat looking at the screen, it didn't matter who the president was or wasn't. it didn't matter what pronoun you should refer to me as. It didn't matter how much my allergies were acting up, or how big of a douche my boss is. For two hours on a Thursday, thanks to this movie, I was just simply enjoying the ride.Look I'm not claiming this was highbrow shit. A football stud named Fridge morphed into Kevin Hart. A shallow Instagram selfie obsessed blonde transformed into Jack Black... I get it. I'd probably fire the guy who pitched me that. But they make it work. The casting was surprisingly perfect. Black fell off my radar about a decade ago and Hart hasn't made a good film in his career, so that teamed with the fact that The Rock will sign on to do anything didn't have me coming in expecting much, but they all delivered career affirming performances and reminded me why I fell in love with the movies to begin with.There were some bum notes. The four high schoolers were a little stereotypical and not well rounded, and the videogame girl was dressed like a videogame girl. But honestly, I had precisely zero problem with any of that. It was funny and silly and one of the first films in a long time that I can dub ""fun for the whole family"" without secretly meaning 'if you're not a kid or a grandparent, bring a flask.' Plus, the lack of character depth made it all the more powerful when it took them becoming archetypical videogame characters to truly figure out who they were as people and what they were individually about. 
They knew exactly what they had with this set up. By putting the characters in a videogame, they were able to forego a lot of the story structure red tape that tends to bog down movies like this. Clunky exposition scenes became fun, and to the point. Because each character had attributes that were clearly stated from the beginning, the world and rules were set from the get go and we just got to enjoy how they used the bag of tools to get from A to B. And since each team member was a piece of the puzzle, we didn't have to worry about that obligatory sequence that makes its way into every similar film where the characters have a big falling out and go their separate ways for 15 minutes to pout in a puddle somewhere. Instead, they just kept the train moving and never looked back.This movie could have been made without any ties to the Jumanji world and not many would have been the wiser, and because of that, new audiences, ignorant of the original, can watch this and feel as though they've missed nothing. At the same time, they tied in some fun nods to the 1995 film that made fan boys like me feel like we got just a little more bang for our buck. 
I would have felt a lot less bad for Alan Parrish all those years ago about the dice never coming up 5 or 8 if I knew being stuck in the jungle was this much fun!Prescriptions

510,danjamz,Could have been so much better,3,11 December 2017,"This sequel took so long to come to fruition, the most unbelievable thing is that the writing could still be so bad. It genuinely feels like they cast the actors first, then wrote supposedly ""cool and funny"" scenes about them, making it feel more like a bunch of unconnected sketches and action sequences than a real story.The main problem is that the humour seemed almost entirely aimed at the handful of young kids in my (very busy) screening, they loved it of course; but literally everyone else... silence for the entire movie. The special effects are fine and the action sequences exciting enough, but without a half-decent story to hold it together, it all feels a bit empty. Ultimately keep your expectations rock bottom and you can probably just go along for the ride. But 22 years after the original, I would highly recommend you give the old one another try before you bother with this.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

The original is well crafted and now it's 2017 and we have Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. It's a fun, action comedy film with really cool references to the first film but as much as it entertains me it's not Jumanji. As Robin Williams said ""I've seen things you've only seen in your nightmares"" but in this film the jungle is safe enough to make margaritas and have scented candles on display. Dwayne Johnson tries to play a geeky character but he still plays that big tough guy. Kevin Hart plays himself nothing new, Karen Gillan plays a geeky shy girl and she has done that before and finally the highlight of the film is Jack Black playing as a teenage girl named Bethany. Everything Jack says is incredibly funny and will leave you falling off your seat. Like I said before it's not Jumanji, 6.5/10.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

I actually love it more that I think about it! So this Jumanji with even it's new sequel that succeeds this one are just remarkable, heartwarming pieces of cinema!! The production team needs to take notes on how it worked for these two sequels, because it connects to the 1995 one really if one wants to face it or not, Jumanji evolved itself into a video game and console in this one!And it blows my mind too how even the actors and actresses all deliver a diverse and exciting team that manages to touch deep, with nodding with their ability to the 1995 one and Robin Williams, himself (R.I.P).Whether you appreciate the update and the respectful love and care that went to connecting itself to the original masterpiece, it is a must-see and this one is original as the original!",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

516,lumosnight,A true adventure and far better than the original,8,24 December 2017,"I re-watched the original Jumanji a few months ago and it made me realise just how dull I found it. It had a good idea and an excellent actor (the late Robin Williams) but it never reached its full potential. Its scenes often felt like the story was dragged along, the humour was weak and I didn't get attached to any of the characters. Given that sequels rarely surpass the originals I was wary of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.Needless to say, I was pleasantly surplussed. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle features characters that are actually likable and we want them to win, the action scenes keep you at the edge of your seat and it was actually funny. Jack Black was hilarious as a self-absorbed teenage girl trapped in an overweight man's body and he truly stole the show. The morals of the story that are addressed here are timeless and focus on issues that teenagers try to resolve, such as breaking away from the modern-age dependence on social media, the rekindling of friendships that had gone cold over time, and overcoming personal insecurities of inadequacy.Overall, it is a feelgood movie and a fun swashbuckling adventure.

Jumanji is definitely fun, and viewers shouldn't take it too seriously!I think what really made me enjoy this movie was the main cast (Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan). All four members did a great job at portraying their characters, but Hart and Black stole the show - they were hilarious! On the contrary, however, I personally didn't like the cast who portrayed the younger versions of these characters (i.e. young Spencer, Fridge, Bethany and Martha). They just didn't stand out to me, and I felt that all their scenes were very contrived. Luckily, however, these scenes were relatively short and didn't affect the movie's quality too greatly. Now apart from the awesome main cast and the handful of funny lines/jokes, there isn't really anything else that's great about this movie. The plot was nothing to write home about, and the villain was very lacklustre. As such, I couldn't rate Jumanji anything higher than a six.

Loved it.,10,13 March 2018,"I would say I gave it a 10 to balance out the bobo-heads with no funny-bone in their body's low scores, but no; this movie deserves a 10 and more. Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a stand-alone, HILARIOUS romp which leaves the original in the dust. Heck, HILARIOUS IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. Note that this is not to say that the original Jumanji was bad. On the contrary, it was great, especially for when it was filmed and who better than SIR Robin Williams, but in terms of laugh-out-loud good fun and non-stop smiles, this Jumanji far outpaces and outdoes the original. While my BF and I have somewhat different tastes in movies, and he is not a Rock fan (he loved him as a wrestler, not so much as an actor), we both laughed SO MUCH while watching this. The Rock knocks it out of the park with equally stellar performances by Jack Black and Kevin Hart. What is even more fabulous is that it has kids humor, yes, but also 'thinking-people's humor' in the form of obscure little tidbits which are dropped here and there and keep you on your toes and grinning ear-to-ear. There is hardly any scene where you step out of the roller coaster ride of fun it sets you on from the moment they (and you) are IN Jumanji.Do yourself a favor. Watch this, and if you don't laugh raucously at LEAST six times, seriously, consider what else might be wrong. In fact, if you read through some of the negative comments, you see the same old, bored, stagnant people complaining about it being ""too PC"", AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. Cry me a river. If you notice these people's other reviews, it is easy to see that anything that they consider too scary (read: progressive) to fit in the mold of their little minds and world, automatically gets relegated to the 1/10 pile. Shame.In closing, this Jumanji gained a place within my favorite movies of all time, and the only thing which makes me sad about it, is that 1. I wonder if upon a fourth viewing (we saw it three times) through my 20th it will lose some of its luster; and 2. that it wasn't much, much longer, as I did not want the fun to end.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Humour was funny, some of it adolescent, but still funny. Moral of the story was good. All of the actors believable, interestingly complex. But that's not why I cried.

528,mayree-79278,Perfect casting!,8,17 March 2018,"Permit me to praise Jack Black for his exceptional portrayal of a ""queen bee"", Kevin Hart's hilariousness and The Rock's, Karen's and Nick Jonas' wonderful portrayal of their real selves plus their avatars. The movie was entertaining and the jungle never had a dull moment. I looked forward to every conversation between the characters and I appreciated the bond that developed within them.
The movie does have its flaws though. For example, the movie is predictable and lacks even the slightest bit of suspense. Also I found it more comedic than emotional. Nothing in the movie actually made me feel emotional towards any character, well aside from Alex naming his daughter after the girl who saved his life. 
The pre-jungle part of the film isn't the most interesting thing in the world. The movie starts to get interesting after Dwayne Johnson lands on his feet in Jumanji.
If you're in for a really good time, and you wanna have a couple of laughs doing so, go watch this movie. Aside from the flaws I listed, ITS THE BOMB",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

530,ldcsp,Jumanji(2017)-Movie Review,7,22 December 2018,"Jumanji-Welcome to the Jungle tells the story about four teens who go into detention, they found an old Videogame called ""Jumanji"" and get stucked in it, there they have to surpass a series of obstacles to get back.
This is the new version of the very succesful movie from the 90´s.With that being said is not a remake, just to clarify.
Welcome to the Jungle has a twist, the teens get into the bodys of different characters, very different form them.It´s a twist that works, the comedy comes from there and also from the stregths and weaknesses of the characters in the game, which are well developed and inserted making the story go forward and making the movie funny. So, in that way the script is well developed even if it is different obstacles the characters have to pass.
The whole cast does a good job giving they´re one mannerisms into the characters in the game.
It is also worth talking about the entertainmment level, the movie never forgets to be fun, problably the biggest virtue of all.
Regarding the negative aspects of the movie, Bobby Cannavle plays an underappreciated generic villain, and there were moments were the CGI could have been improved.
Jumanji-Welcome to the jungle is a well developed movie, it´s fun, funny, thrilling and surprisingly touching by the end.7.1/10",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

In our showing, with a majority young teens audience I heard a lot of laughter and didn't see a single mobile screen flash on. Left with a big smile on my face.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
533,JeffOA,Average but worth a watch,6,15 March 2018,"In my book the new iteration of Jumanji is your average adventure movie. It has thrills, humour, and tries to tell you something about life. It remains a popcorn flick but for anyone who wants to watch a movie that will fade away after a day or two, but still offers enough enjoyment for an evening, Jumanji gives you just that. Featuring three of the funniest guys in Hollywood and one talented hot chick (and one of brothers Jonas) the movie remains approachable and well-paced throughout. There is a framework for character development but as expected it is forced and basic as hell. I would still watch the original from '95 but for modern audiences this would likely becomes the go to film in the 'franchise'. There will be likely another one based on the huge money it earned so far.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
534,kersetaartjuhh-703-517444,No Jumanji level film at all!!!,5,3 January 2018,"I thought the new Jumanji film was a huge disappointment!I'm not saying that in and of itself the film was bad or that there were no good elements in there... But when you compare this to the original Jumanji film it's just nowhere near it!One of the things that irritated me throughout the movie was the silly humour... I don't mind a little humour in an action movie, but there's a time and a place for it and it's not supposed to be constant... I mean, this film isn't meant to be a comedy, I take it? How is this supposed to be suspenseful at all with the constant bickering and ridiculousness? It just gives the impression that we're not supposed to take anything that happens seriously, for example one guy even throws another off a cliff just cause he's angry? OK, they have 3 lives, but still, in that situation they had no idea when that extra life might have been needed, so that's just way too careless to be realistic.The second thing I disliked about the film is that it's simply adding way too many things to the original concept, which leads to a great deal of confusion. The idea of having Jumanji turn into a videogame because that's more relevant today and then having characters sucked into the bodies of avatars in the game is not a bad idea. But then a lot of other stuff was added to the plot and also a lot of elements I felt did not quite match the jungle setting. 
When you're talking about something that roars in Jumanji, you're expecting a lion or a leopard to make an appearance, not a biker gang...
Then there was the setting of the bazar which I felt would have been more at home in a desert setting than in a jungle. We're expecting an African traditional village populated by Manji's, nothing quite as large or civilised as the city of the bazar, I mean, there were even sewers! I'm not even going to go into the unlikeliness of an adventurer in the jungle avatar having cake as a weakness. Where is he even supposed to get cake in a jungle? And what kind of allergy to cake makes you explode?
And the setting of the warehouse with vehicles is even more puzzling. I mean there's even a schoolbus there, in the middle of the jungle! There could have been a wreckage of a plane or a helicopter there that the characters had to fix up to get to where they had to go. But a whole warehouse full of vehicles with two guys guarding it while listening to a radio?
Also the character of Van Pelt is nothing at all like in the first film and his biker gang just comes falling from the sky without hardly any introduction or explanation. Afterwards we just get a quick, confusing explanation about them being cursed because they took the emerald, but what exactly this curse entails or what abilities the emerald can give those that carry it are not explained at all.I think if the movie didn't refer to the original Jumanji movie that often, all of this could be explained as simply a different, less serious interpretation of things. But the references to the first movie are just everywhere, not only when it comes to the form the game presents itself in but they even find a hut built by Allan Parrish? But somehow everything Allan said about the Jumanji jungle in the first film is inaccurate? There definitely wasn't anyone all that frightened by strange noises at night and the sound of something eating and nobody was hoping that they weren't its next meal, no, they were all just chilling and drinking margaritas...So not a terrible film in and of itself, but it's nowhere near as serious, coherent or suspenseful as the original Jumanji film. If you're planning on watching this, it's probably best that you don't expect anything at all like the original and that you don't take the movie all that seriously.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

But in other ways I thought it should have been a sequel to the original rather than a revamp. But where the changes to the story warranted?

I was forced to see it with my sister and two friends during Christmas break, so I thought why not. When I got out of the movie theatre, I began to debate if the new movie or if the original was the better one. I now feel this movie is better than the original.The first Jumanji movie didn't even bring us into the game, but rather had the game in the real world. While I do like that idea, the new Jumanji movie did better in the grand scheme. They actually brought us into the game, and they give us a goal to achieve in order to win. There is a lot of comedy, but they know when it's necessary. The action is great, and the actors do great. It's nonstop fun, but it also tells us a good lesson that is actually thought out for how they can put it in.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

It's a great fun/fantasy movie, and Robin Williams is awesome. There is a little story from the first movie that is needed but for the most part, this movie stands on it's own.I've seen other movies try to use video game physics or logic, only to come off lame and corny. But the crew on Jumanji absolutely nail it. They use a significant amount of video game logic and actually turn this into a far better movie than it would be without it. Every one of the main 4 actors are incredible.I loved the chemistry between The Rock and Kevin Hart in Central Intelligence, and based on those two alone, I wanted to see this movie. But the whole movie turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. The story line of the movie is pretty predictable, but they way they get from the beginning to the end has significant new twists and turns that are entertaining, and just downright hilarious.

The leads had great comedic talent and I liked the way that they made me feel like they actually were in other people's bodies. It was a bonus to see one of my favorite actors appear mid movie. The only quibble I have is that the bad guy was a let down. I kept waiting for him to show his powers and be a great threat and expecting a big ""boss"" fight but sadly it did not happen. Also the Transport Hanger was built up as hard level to beat and it was not. They easily outnumbered the guards who were defeated by a single character.

It's a good concept, and the director Jake Kasdan delivered it in a funny way. While in the game, the teenagers transform into the characters they selected, which are played by Dwayne Johnson as Spencer, Kevin Hart as Fridge, Jack Black as Bethany and Karen Gillan as Martha. This transformation was a trigger for all of them to start questioning who they really are and to realize some of the problems and correspondent solutions to their problems. With a lot of adventure and a lot of funny moments, the movie definitely was not boring, and even though it had some corny moments, it was very enjoyable. As usual, Kevin Hart didn't disappoint with his humor. I just love seeing this actor in action. In my opinion, he deserved a bit more of screen time, but to be fair, the rest of the actors had to have their own time, and it was well distributed, I didn't feel like some got more attention than others, which is a good thing. Another thing that this movie succeeded to deliver was the feel and experience of a video game with ""real life graphics"". As a gamer, it was really funny to imagine myself in some of their situations. I don't want to spoil, you should see for yourself. Overall, the movie delivers what's intended: a Jumanji sequel.

570,cronos090693,"Lazy script, actors did their best with what they got",4,20 December 2019,"This is one of those films that's designed for a big audience and is therefore measured to appeal to most. In essence there is nothing wrong with that. It can still result in a wonderful family film. But it's problematic when the movie feels like its made with an easy ingredients recipe by a chef that forgot to put some flavor in.All the elements that made the original film a succes (and to some a classic) are present, but the narrative is put together with so little imagination that I felt like I was watching a movie I'd seen a hundred times before. And you know what, they could get away with it - if the gags were better and the character's weren't made out of cardboard.Don't get me wrong. There are funny moments. I laughed hard a couple of times, but regardless this whole movie felt like a missed opportunity. The Rock is great as Spencer aka Dr. Bravestone, an anxious nerd made jungle hero. The way The Rock pulls out some signature looks and plays with insecure mannerisms made me think back of his hilarious performance in Be Cool. Kevin Hart has his funny moments, but he's essentially playing himself, not getting much further than delivering some sas and tiny man rants here and there. Karen Gillan gives us the best performance and Jack Black is trying hard to be funny but the whininess of the high school princess he plays makes it a difficult task to pull off. How did you screw that up guys? Jack Black is inherently hilarious.The characters lack grit and the friction between the protagonists is too weak. It's not because you're making an adventure film that kids can go see that the emotional world of the characters shouldn't be tangible. It all feels very childish, the dialogue and the performances. It's clear that this is because of the script and the direction, The Rock and friends didn't get much to work with.I was also pretty disappointed in terms of cinematography. It's all kind of bland, just like the characters.

572,jerrycrow44,"Very Funny, lots of laughs.",8,29 April 2018,"I just watched this and couldn't stop laughing. Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan all delivered the laughs. 
The reasons I didn't give it a 10 rating are the CGI for some of Ruby Roundhouse could have been much better and the penis jokes didn't make the movie any funnier so they could have been left out, movies parents and their children would like to watch together don't need that.
As for some of the bad reviews I've read, I don't know what they are looking for in what can be defined as slapstick comedy. One reviewer was talking about plot holes and others just said it wasn't funny at all. This isn't a movie that makes you ""think"" so looking for plot holes is a waste.

The director and screenwriters of this film should win every Razzie award for decades to come.Karen Gillan was actually ok. But the dialogue is so on-the-nose and expositional that every scene feels mechanical and unnatural.It's sad that they can take Robin William's classic Jumanji and just steal the title.

How can someone in good faith give a positive review is an insult to the previous generation of movie creators that have worked to their best to give moviegoers a quality time and not just please the average Joe and make the most money while doing so. As a movie Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle does not make your money worth at all, nor does it have anything artistic about it, and as long as everyone gets their paycheck movies like this one will continue to be made. Whatever passes is good to be shot as a movie I guess, and even more worrisome standards have gotten to record low in the industry, and have been doing so for some time now. I obviously discourage anyone to go pay and see this movie.

581,ryan_reed,Zabulido: Welcome to the Nonsense,4,28 August 2018,"This movie relates very poorly to the original Jumanji. I actually watched this twice to see if I missed something. The original board game is found conveniently under about 1 inch of sand on the beach. The boy that finds it takes it home and sets it aside because it's a ""board game"". Overnight, the game spits out an Atari/Nintendo disk labeled ""Jumanji"". The next thing we know is that the Atari/Nintendo and the game disk are now at the school in the detention area. Really? It is not clear AT ALL how the game itself gets from the boy's house to the school so that it can be found again. The plot is overall quite weak. In this incarnation of Jumanji, the game apparently sucks you in no matter what - no riddles or trivial game moves that cause it. So, four teenagers are now in Jumanji-land - but they've become different people (the main headliner actors). They must break the ""curse"" caused by the new ""Van Pelt"" when he removed a large green crystal from its place in the world. The curse never really made any sense to me (and if it was ever explained in the movie it was done poorly) - It seemed as if they were just on a ""quest"". And, on their quest through Jumanji-land, everything that happens is obvious and predictable. I will say it again: obvious. The obstacles (animals, terrain, people) they encounter are like a walk in the park compared to those of the original Jumanji. And, while the obstacles do not seem very challenging to begin with, it feels like they escape or solve the issue way too conveniently. And then the movie dips into a lull and drags for some time - probably 15 - 20 minutes or more - and I just kept thinking, ""Wouldn't it be cool if they did something here?"". And, as for the new Van Pelt, we are talking about a very odd and poorly executed villain. Picture a greasy-haired stoner with one completely white eye, a strange gait, and really bad lines. And, I have to mention this: When Alan Parrish returned from the game in 1995 in the original movie, he was himself - it's hard for me to now buy into the ""I get sucked in and become somebody else"" thought process. I do like the actors: Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Kevin Hart. Black performs his part well, as does Johnson. I liked Gillan's performance (but I've never seen her before). Kevin Hart is, well Kevin Hart. All in all, this movie could have been titled ""Zabulido: Welcome to the Nonsense"" and it could have been released as it bears such a weak connection with its supposed inspiration and predecessor. The cast and their great talents help to barely get me to a ""4"".",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Even so, I wasn't expecting this to be an exact copy of the original. I even liked the idea of bringing the game into a different kind of one (sort of digital), although the vibe from a board game is missed.No, what I believe is the movie's biggest flaw is not being able to MAKE YOU BELIEVE the characters are inside a game.

As a family film it ticks all the boxes it needs to. The humour works on all of the necessary levels and kept the children completely engrossed in the entire adventure. 
A couple of nods to the story of the previous movie keep things on track, although everything happens a little too quickly in the very early scenes.
Even if you think that a cheesey Dwayne Johnson film isn't for you, you'll be surprised. This is exactly the right place for it and his chemistry with Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan brings a great level of comedy to our screen.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

The humour was brilliant and the acting was spot on and you never forgot that the adult faces you know so well are actually the teenagers that started the film, because they play them so well!Also I loved the little details such as in-game characters repeating their lines as it makes you feel like you are a kid again playing a video game as well as watching a great movie.

593,hutchnotes,Jack Black Saves this Slightly Above Average Comedy,6,11 January 2018,"NOTESIt had me laughing out loud at times as a slightly above-average comedy, but the laughs were pretty superficial so, I give it a C+. Jack Black is the true gem of this film, winning me over more and more as the film went on. Not much of a plot, hardly clever, but did lead to some moments that made me chuckle. I had to move to a different seat twice throughout the film as the viewers sitting next to me couldn't manage to listen to the film, instead repeating line after line of cheap dialogue. This tells me that even though it's not a great film, people seem to love it.REVIEWI don't know whether you'd call it a sequel or a remake, but either way ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" occupies a similar universe as the Robin Williams film I remember from my childhood. It begins with the Jumanji board game being found on a beach under some sand. Once the discoverer takes it home and realizes it's a board game instead of a video game he shelves it. The game magically morphs into a video game, calls to him, he plugs it in, and he is sucked into the game. Years later that same video game console is found by four mismatched teenagers while serving time in detention. Hmmm, Breakfast Club anyone? One teen is a self-absorbed, cell phone-addicted ""hot girl"" named Bethany, another is the intelligent Martha who is struggling with her self esteem. Spencer is the self-proclaimed nerd, and Fridge is the tall, athletic football player. After they get sucked into the game they discover that their bodies have become the pre-set avatars from the game itself. Spencer becomes the goliath Dwayne Johnson while Fridge ironically becomes Kevin Hart. Martha becomes the scantily-clad Karen Gillan, and Bethany hilariously becomes Jack Black. They are charged with saving the jungle of Jumanji by returning the stone to the eye of the jaguar and saying the game's name. After they complete this mission they are then free to leave the game. The unlikely heroes set out to try and return home, but are met with all the twists and turns of a typical RPG video game.There isn't much to be said about the plot of the film - the game comes to life - it's a clever idea we've seen before in the original ""Jumanji."" The added comic twist of the characters occupying their avatars' bodies is the fresh aspect. Dwayne Johnson, who often impresses me, gave a solid performance as the cowardly nerd occupying a hulk of a body. Karen Gillan, whom I've never seen before, gave a fittingly awkward performance as the insecure Martha. Kevin Hart played, well, Kevin Hart, disappointingly. According to the blueprints of the film and all the other performances, he was supposed to play Fridge, the big athletic football player, but instead he's just Kevin Hart making wild comments about how tall he's really supposed to be. Jack Black takes the cake here depicting the self-absorbed Bethany who is surprised to be a fat, middle-aged man with a penis.Generally, the humor is not particularly clever and doesn't contain much substance, but there are some heart-warming scenes throughout. Jack Black's character experiences the most character development and has the most interesting character arc, even though the film made it seem like Johnson's character was supposed to. The body humor does hint at (without ever seriously going there) the idea of being trapped in a body you don't want, and in a few instances makes it rather fun and comical (imagine going to the bathroom). Other than that no real issues are brought up or discussed despite providing the perfect vehicle for such commentary (a lost opportunity to be sure). The universal theme mainly concerns bravery and believing in yourself, and I will give the film credit for a well-deserved sentimental ending.I was disappointed in Kevin Hart's performance, or rather the way his role was constructed. He really took me out of the film. If they'd written or directed Fridge to deliver his lines in the flamboyant way Kevin Hart delivers his the continuity of the film would have been much better. The only reason I gave the film an above average score was due to Jack Black's convincing performance of a girl who is more concerned about finding her cell phone than the fact that she is now in a different body. The movie was nearly sold out on a Monday night a week after opening weekend, so it's obviously doing well enough with audiences, but these are not the audiences you'd expect to see in a slow-burning, dialogue-heavy, contemplative film. That said, I did enjoy the film, and I don't regret watching it, but I kind of wish I'd waited to see this one on a streaming service at home.See hutchnotes.com for more reviews.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

3) There are some useful and teaching stuff throughout the title, which is a big plus to the plot;

4) It is all about fun and laughter; you are never going to get bored watching Jumanji!With that said, I wholeheartedly and sincerely adored Jumanji and thus, give it a 9.

595,jpatriciogs,super fun & entertaining,7,27 December 2017,"The movie is really fun and entertaining - basic and simple humor style, unpretentious plot but worth watching if you are after some comedy
I don't really remember the original Jumanji so I guess it was not a masterpiece, this sequel may not be so faithful to the plot or essence (if had any) of the original movie but if you go with no expectations you will surely enjoy it
The movie starts a little bit forced, maybe trying too hard to put things in a way to make sense (in fact couple things are totally non sense), but after a short time it flows well and do the job as comedy/action movie 
It reminded me of cheesy movies like The Mummy Returns/Brendan Fraser
There are many jokes or situations that are more for adults/teens (the movie is PG-13) so that's a low point, specially if you have younger kids wanting to watch it because they want to see DJ/The Rock, although the movie in general is quite clean and simple",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

601,Jerome-3009,Unexpectedly brilliant,9,6 May 2018,"This is great. Anyone who's ever played a video game will enjoy this, it pokes harmless fun at game formats, blends it perfectly with the story, and everything makes sense when you watch it - for example, I read a piece by a journalist questioning why Karen Gillan is pictured in a different style of costume to the men on the poster - well obviously that journalist hadn't seen or even read up on this movie beforehand.To be honest, this story could have been written any time in the past 20 years since this type of game was already popular on the PC... but only now could it be brought to the screen with such excitement, humour and imagination, as most of us have a familiarity with gaming formats, and it works beautifully. And it just so happens that the cast are perfect for it, everything they do is tongue in cheek and you can see 'both' characters they are playing in their wonderful performances. Each brings something special to the roles they play.I'd like to see more sequels to this, I think there's scope for it.As a final note - it's quite clear to me that Karen Gillan should have been picked to play Lara Croft in the new Tomb Raider, it might have saved it; no disrespect to AV (now part of 'acting royalty', she'll be fine!) but KG has the magic ingredient - wow.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
602,cinema-32,mini review of Jumanji 2,7,10 January 2018,"Jumanji 2 doesn't raise the bar in terms of viewing expectations, in other words you mostly get what you came for and that's not such a bad thing.
I don't remember being a huge fan of the first film, was never enamored with Robin Williams' manic excesses.
The second time around seems a bit more laid back powered by an enjoyable cast led by The Rock who truly deserves that moniker. His whole body is something to behold, serious granite going on there.
The young kids playing the real life versions of their more famous counterparts do a credible job as well with the obvious obligatory contemporary updates like cellphones and selfies.
The biggest laughs are generated by Kevin Hart as a reduced in size football star, a wimp now reincarnated as a kickass Dwayne Johnson (what a dream!) and a petulant self obsessed, prettily vacuous cheerleader as a rotund, spectacled middle age dweeb played by Jack Black. Didn't know the actress Karen Gillan but she more than holds her own as the wannabe vamp of the bunch with killer kung fu and dance moves.
There are a few modest laughs to be had here, nothing like belly laughs but some chuckle worth inducing moments.
I didn't expect too much so I wasn't disappointed. The dialogue was trite with the clicheed homilies of live your life to the fullest, you only have one life, let's go team, we can do this together, ect.... more than serviceable with nothing too deep. This is not a movie meant to educate or inspire, we're strictly along for the ride and the potentially entertainment value.
Did find the CG effects pretty shabby overall. The jungle never felt like the jungle, ditto for the animals, could smell a green background. Maybe I'm just getting used to the way CG effects look on the screen, these did not impress. A fun 2 hours, I give it a B-",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

604,mrithunjayan,JUMANJI - Time Pass Guaranteed!!!,9,27 January 2018,"Article contains spoilers!!!Very few movies create a buzz when a reboot is planned. One such movie is Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle. For people who have seen the earlier version, this one will be a different experience. With the latest technologies helping the makers of the movie, it is bound to be an exciting version!!!The main cornerstone of the movie - Dwayne Johnson @ Rock makes his appearance, almost after 15-20 mins into the movie. Along with him, the star cast of Jack Black, Kevin Hart adds so much value to the movie. Especially the dialogue exchange between them is humorous to the core!!!Jack Black is very natural and delivers the best that is needed for the movie. Kevin Hart with his witty one liners and expressions hits it out of the park. The others too have played substantially well to suit the need. However, it is the characterization of everyone gets glorified with the one and only THE ROCK @ Dwayne Johnson. I grew up watching him fight inside the squared circle, so for me, he is always THE ROCK!!!However, not everything is great and awesome in the movie. I am not going to comment on the story-line or the technical aspects because I ain't qualified to do so.. However, for me there were numerous instances where the CG work could have been better.

610,nogle-02644,Pretty fun movie,6,31 May 2019,"First off, I am glad that this movie didn't try to reboot or ignore it's predecessor, but it didn't force feed us references and cameos (cough Ghostbusters cough). That is very much appreciated. Second off, even though it never would have happened, Jack Black legitimately deserved an Oscar nomination for this movie. Never for a second did I not believe he was a teenage girl. He does so much more than just play on the stereotypes as well. Mr. Black gives Bethany a proper character arc, using subtle humor. He is the best part of the movie by miles. On that note, the movie does an impressive job of depicting high schoolers realistically, even if they are trapped in the bodies of video game avatars. Another performance that wowed me was Karen Gillen. I've been a fan of hers since Doctor Who and I was incredibly pleased to see her do such a great job with her character, a fun little play on the stereotypical video game female. If I had to pick a cast member I wasn't pleased with, it was Kevin Hart. He didn't seem to put as much effort into his character as the rest of the cast. It would have been better if they would have cast an actor who doesn't act the same in every movie, one who could've given a more talented performance. I also found that character rather weak. And Nick Jonas... sigh. The villain was fine. Nothing special. The introduction of his character felt really unnecessary and forced. I do wish the movie had gone a little farther with its parody of video games. It introduces fun concepts, like the cutscene, but doesn't really run with it enough to make it as fun as it could be. All in all a flawed, but ultimately fun and funny movie, even if a few jokes don't land.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

614,svnair-13226,Load of fun,8,20 February 2018,"You better watch this movie before its gone from multiplexes. Unlike the old version of Jumanji, this is the GAME altogether. The Rock, Kevin Hart and Jack Black make an awesome trio just bringing in the laughter at different scenes across the movie. I found Kevin Harts character really funny and crazy :)... Leave the first few scenes until the group shows up in the game, then starts the fun right till the end ! Simply hilarious, worth watching :)",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
615,J-enni,Entertaining and great fun,8,15 January 2018,"I really enjoyed this film. Yes, it's full of clichés like the nerdy and shy guy becoming the muscle who saves the day and the real-life muscle becoming awkward and insecure and then they realize that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses and so on. There are also two girls who seem to despise the other's way of life and they also realize that the other isn't that bad after all. So yes, it's really basic setting with all that ""emotional growth of characters"" and ""putting totally different and stereotypical people together and they learn to solve problems together"" but still the film manages to be entertaining and great fun.The actors are great, they seem to have good connection and they work well together. Jack Black does good job as ""Bethany"". I usually don't like that much Jack Black's films, but he was really good choice for the role of irritating teenybopper. He really nails this part. I also liked Dwayne Johnson as Spencer. Dwayne Johnson is your typical video game hero, so he fits this role perfectly but I'm glad that his character wasn't just the flawless hero as such but made fun of him being such a beefcake and laughed at the stereotypes. If you are going to make a film with this stereotyped setting, you should be able to laugh at yourself and those stereotypes and this film does that. All those clichés weren't that annoying at all, because the film laughed at them also.For 9 or 10 stars this film should have had also some touching moments that make you cry and the characters should have been more compelling and real and not so stereotypical but all in all, this was entertaining, I liked the jokes and humor of this film and the actors do great job. Good family film that makes you laugh.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
616,alxs-29192,This movie should not be this entertaining.,6,28 April 2018,"Going into this movie I didn't expect much. It's a movie with Kevin Hart Dwayne Johnson and Jack Black. I expected a movie with 1 or 2 funny scenes and sequences mostly due to Kevin Hart. But this movie is not this at all. It's easily Hart's and Johnson's best performances. Jack Black probably does the best job with his character as a teenage shallow girl and provides lots of comedy throughout the movie. The plot is intruiging and the movie is just lots of fun. Karen Gillan, who I had never seen before was also pretty good. Not only is this movie good but it has me hyped for the sequel (or trilogy if you consider this a sequel for the first movie).",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
617,scifi-97852,I was surprised I genuinely enjoyed it,9,4 December 2018,"I'm going to be flat honest, I went into this movie expecting not to enjoy it. It's a sequel 20 years later to a movie I really, really loved. And not to mention that Robin Williams made such a huge impact on my childhood and has sadly since passed, meaning anything anyone did would have to ultimately be compared to his original work, I expected to be tearing this movie apart.I expected to be doing that.But I'm not.Everyone in this movie really loved this movie and it came through. And they obviously loved the original too. They didn't try to reinvent the wheel, but instead redesigned it to fit a new vehicle. The game was still the game but in a new way that was still dated (feeling old and new at the same time) just like a game that is mysterious and possibly ancient should be. The characters chemistry worked well together, these guys are obviously friends on set and probably off too. And the dynamics of the story felt appropriate for kids my this generation, just like the dynamics felt right in the first movie for my generation.In the end I found myself laughing and saying aww and yes, even falling for the smoulderingly a time or two. If you go into this looking for a faithful remake of the first film you're going to be sorely disappointed. But if you're looking for a sequel done by people who obviously loved the original and wanted to continue the fascinating and amazing world of Jumanji, it's well worth it.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

Wow, honestly was not expecting this to be as awesome as it is and while it took me a while to watch it I was not disappointed. Without offering any spoilers I will say that this film offers some really great action and all the cast offer some fantastic moments throughout that will bring a smile to your face and keep you laughing throughout. There is a simple story but its simplicity alongside some fine action, cgi work and the great cast creating fantastic comedic moments you will not be disappointed by taking a trek in the jungle with this ensemble.
Personally would like to say that Jack Black stole the show, noting against the fine work of Johnson, Hart & Gillian but for him to act like he did in this role will instantly have you in stitches.
A great family film that is fun for all ages !

624,Misstumbler,Nice sequel! Better than my expectation,9,22 December 2017,"I actually come to watch this movie with low expectation. I watched 1st Jumanji and it was really great (and I watched it a couple times). The sequel is a little different with it's successor, with the theme is still same, a game that involved real adventures to it's player. Four teenagers sucked into the game, and they become a character they chose (which is very different from their real life). The movie is so funny, and if you played RPGs game you will find this really entertaining. The humour is still suitable for young audiences, so it's a family movie too. And while it's a humour adventures movie, it still have a good message. So I really recommend it, hope you'll enjoy it too.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
625,wwolfmin,Fun adventure,8,26 December 2017,"This movie is pure fun as has been said in other reviews. Well worth seeing in theaters and worth seeing again. The idea of kids in adult bodies that are very different from themselves has been done, but probably not as well as this movie. We have a video game world that plays out with the idea that if you loose your lives it is game over. The actors do a great job, and bring out what is fun for these movies. Ruby Roundhouse and Pro. Shelly being the best of this movie. And of skill sets Dance Fight is a great skill to have that made me laugh. And the weakness to cake was well done. And the movie does not go in the direction as I was expecting with how things would play out. 
Such as in typical video game style would have one of the party be a traitor and I kept thinking which was going to be the traitor. This could have gone that route, but the movie would have taken a more serious tone at that point.
 
There is a nice tribute to Alan Perish, but this is not the world that Alan described from before. There are no Monsoons here, but plenty of other action. I kind of relate this movie more to Zanthura then Jumanji in a lot of the areas. 
two missing stars.
So there are few things that I am just missing and wished was there. And I focused just on these things I would have not have enjoyed the movie as much. So the these missing stars are really just for what was missing that I would have liked, but probably in the minority.  
Jumanji taking over the real world. 
The same video game style concept could have worked with the kids as themselves having to deal with a video game taking over the real world. Not ""PIXEL"" style but Jumanji style. This would have given us Spencer having to be brave as himself instead of being in an avatar that would make it easier to be brave. Really he did not want to go back in the end of the game. And if he rescued his girl as himself from a snake might have been different then smolder saving Ruby.
 
Instead of NPC, what if the people you know every day are morphing into NPCs. There is just something about being a kid, or adult having to face a jaguar in the world you are in without the cages. And I would have like to have seen Bethany who would be at home at the mall, having to deal with a mall turned into a deadly jungle. Killer plants at walmart on isle 3. But keeping it at the school would have been a great setting.The second is the threat of danger. 
The video game world is used well, but it is based on todays standards of multiple lives. Take this back to 1995 and you have one life but might have to earn more makes for different game play. And I am still wondering what happens if you run out of lives. Spencer said game over, but they did not get many things right in the game. So here there are three lives per person and is used well, but that takes a lot of the thrill and danger out of Jumanji. We do not have to avoid the hippos, we just have to reboot. Dr. Smolder threw his assistant out of the window as canon fodder just because he knew he would reboot this time. The old game would have penalized him as the rule was to work together.
Spenser wanted to stay there in the end. Alan Parish and the two kids in the 1800s never wanted to play this game again.The original villain of Jumanji also added into the thrill of the movie. He wants to kill me, for no reason. He just does not like Alan because the game made it that way. Here I was expecting the villain to attack the Smolder or foil him at every turn. The dangers of the jungle are not as unexpected here. The rules are of a normal video game, which I would have never though Jumanji to be. 
""You better watch just where you stand, the floor is quicker than quicksand""
Here the bugs are small, the animals for some reason do not feel that unique. 
Probably because the dangerous one was shown in the trailer so it took away some of the shock of the movie.A third is the rules of Jumanji
The game played was not the four that started the journey, but the one kid that started it 20 years ago. So when ending, the game would have gone back to 1995 (96). The others would have learned nothing of their game, but he would have meet them 20 years later. But that would have been a hard thing to work out with us just meeting the sea pilot in just a little while. And the others not really being friends so they would not be together in the end. But if they dropped the sea pilot or had someone appear with them while playing then the rules would have worked out. But that is the way. 
The games you play are safe. When you finish the game you go back to being who you are. You like being smolder, but at the end of the day you know it is just a game. So you mean the original jumanji is not safe. Don't worry about it, just go to the games you have and leave that one behind. Let's just say I'm hoping for a Never Ending Story 4 (non rebooted just continued on like this) and for a not safe Jumanji 4 continued on with a new set of people. But even if Jumanji 4 was like this one it would not be a bad thing.But that is just a time loop issue that the original did well, and the zanthura did well, and this one forgot or just ignored. The time loop would have lead to a darker movie though. And just thinking about about what all would have to change is why I do not make movies and just watch them. This time loop issue, is another reason I'm am guess that for most the weakness of a character is a one shot. I really expected the cake bomb to come back in the end.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

627,z120511,Lost the spark of what Jumanji is,4,19 December 2019,"The original film was like a first foray into horror films for children. It was at times frightening, with the creepy idea that you could be sucked into a board game and have to survive in a merciless jungle until someone sets you free. Much like the original Jurassic Park, it perfectly balanced fantasy and horror with a bit of comedy peppered in to alleviate some of the more tense moments. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle throws all of that out the window, and turns it into a cartoony, campy comedy film. While the film does have laughs and can be entertaining at times, it's just a shame to see such a fun idea turn into a joke with no consequence or terror to anything happening to the characters. While it may seem nitpicky to say, it just has no heart. The original was fraught with sadness for Alan as he returns from the horrifying jungle to find his parents died pouring their life savings into finding their son. I don't want to see the Rock flexing every other minute while Kevin Hart quips in between for an entire film. This film is a Jumanji film by name only.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

629,mundhra_mayank,Feels like watching a video game with real actors!,8,22 January 2018,"There have been quite a few attempts at making movies out of games, or movies where the characters are playing the game. Jumanji sets a great standard on what all to do in such a movie. First and foremost, this is not a movie that is related much to the original Robin Williams movie. The game itself is the only thing in common between the two, and that too is a cameo. So the game transforms itself into a video game to lure the young of today who are no longer interested in board games. So we have 4 high school kids who happen to find this game and end up being stuck into to, having to win it in order to get back to their real lives.1. The first thing that will impress anyone is that the characters are independent of what your true self is. The characters in the game are the avatars which the players choose to be. So we have a nerdy, thin, afraid, kid Spencer transform into D. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) and so on. The characters are pretty well developed. They take time to adjust to the reality of the game, akin to Neo in the Matrix. They realize that they have powers they can harness and only need to be confident. At the same time they also have limitations set on their avatars by the game. So we can see Dwayne Johnson transform from being Spencer to Dr. Bravestone. The best of the four was perhaps Jack Black who did a great job at portraying an avatar (Prof. Shelly Oberan) of a girl, Bethanie, and all the learning that comes with the change of gender.2. The story line is pretty gamish, which is perfect. The game has not just transformed, it has evolved into a video game. There is a back story to the game that they are stuck in. And this game has levels which need to be cleared. Plus there are side characters in the movie who behave like characters in the game, in the sense that they only have a set of responses to give.3. The music of the move is somewhere in between of an action movie and an adventure movie, which you need if you have The Rock in an adventure film. It isn't grand, but gets the job done.4. First time movie director Jake Kasdan does a great job as far as the action part is concerned. The chase sequences are awesome, in particular the where the gamers have a herd of rhinos on their back. The sequence will get you on the edge of the seat and bite your lips! It was amazing to see how the characters evolve and they each have their strengths which come into the play. The best thing he does is make the movie very unpredictable. The riddles which the game gives to the players sound like one thing, but mean something completely different. And when the true meaning becomes clear to you and the characters, you can't just stop going ""WOW!"" The only thing I found lacking was the use of 3D and I think this would have made just as much impact in 2D. But maybe 3D is the thing to make action movies in these days.Overall it is a great movie to watch and do hit the theater to enjoy it the best.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

The avatars playing against the real-life personas was much funnier than I had thought it would be. If you want a genuine laugh and a subversion of tropes, this movie is for you! It also pays some respect to the original, and doesn't destroy any of what that one set out to do. The ending that came for the love interests was one of my favourite things because it really went against what most movies do. I'll explain further down (here is where the spoiler comes into play):The two outcasts had crushes on each other, rather than one or the other pining after the popular choices like most outcasts in movies do. Also, the popular, self-obsessed girl had a crush, but it didn't even lead to a romance, it just led to her development as a character - becoming more aware of the feelings of others, and helping them selflessly.I really didn't expect that refreshing change from this movie, but that's what it gave us, and I am happy I gave it a chance!",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
636,veeresh1209,A movie with power packed smoldering intensity,7,6 April 2018,"Reboots can be tricky. While some click, most of them crumble under the pressure to shake off the barrage of comparisons that would be thrown at the movie. Last couple of years saw such horrible reboots like Jurassic World, The Mummy, Kong: Skull Island. But much like Spiderman: Homecoming, Jumanji succeeds to impress the viewers. 
Jumanji gets a modern age makeover where now instead of a board game it is a video game. Four teenagers with varying personalities are put together in a detention. Here they discover the Jumanji video game and enter the world of Jumanji as their avatars. Then starts the fun ride. There are enough plot holes like how did the video game end up in a high school from Alex's freak house. The movie uses time tested cliche - Four teenagers with some flaw realize their shortcomings when (literally) seen from some other's point of view. But the fun parts of the movie makes us forget them, at least till the movie ends.The movie does not take itself seriously, and that is a huge plus point. The plot of the movie is crazy, there are man eating albino (what?!) rhinos on one side and villainous henchmen with crazy mud racing bike skills on the other side. But such craziness has been ridiculed in the movie itself, which makes you fall in love with it more.The bigger plus for the movie has been the performance of the lead actors. All of them have created niche for themselves in the film industry. Jumanji has used such niche beautifully and built very funny characters. Parts where Dwayne Johnson(Spencer) stops to admire his own physique will have you in splits. Not to mention his hilarious display of 'smoldering intensity'. Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart and Jack Blake as a women in a man's body is perfect. Karen Gillan, who is this mean Nebula in MCU, comes up with a very charming performance.All in all, Jumanji is a movie that you can watch without any regret.

All the actors did a fabulous job acting like they were ""new"" in their skin. And Jack Black took the prize for me. He brought the kooky, hilarious and sweetness of Robin Williams and put it on display for us all in a wonderfully hilarious performance.
Years ago I used to also think Jack Black was only good for slap stick comedy. But he has become one of my favorite actors. From The Holiday, to The Clock Hidden in the Wall, to Jumanji, he is so versatile.And I thought they did a great job continuing the Jumanji story. Honoring R.W. with the side note to the home he made in the Jumanji world. And they did a great job exploring how devastating the game can be to ones left behind, and to ones left inside.It was so funny, I can only imagine Robin looking down and laughing like crazy as well!So proud of a Sony for doing an amazing job at making a movie worthy of the original.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

What video game character has to pee? It also doesn't have the heart of the original. The video game twist was a fun idea on how to make it more modern, but lots of people still play board games. Also, they figured out the premise really fast. The game flops back and fourth between the characters acting like their real world selves and having the abilities of their video game selves whenever it is convenient for the plot or comedy.

645,Syphied,Jumanji: Welcome to its Review,6,30 December 2017,"The idea of a disaster film using board games is not a new concept; Zathura (2005) and Jumanji (1995) have both demonstrated how action packed, yet underwhelming they can be. The transformation of the infamous Jumanji board game into a video game now presents its challenges to a new group of strangers as they get teleported inside the console when serving in an unsupervised detention in closed, dark room. Despite having a rather sceptical concept for film goers, the promising cast ties thrill and humour into a film which lacks a convincing villain.Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan play the avatars of high school nerds as Dr Smolder Bravestone and Ruby Roundhouse respectively. Despite Karen Gillan performing in science fiction films and series, her role of an adventurer is lovable and fun. Dwayne Johnson also features his towering powerhouse of a body and leadership personality as he plays alongside comedians Kevin Hart and Jack Black. The latter two did not disappoint in conjuring the occasional laughter when the team were in mortal peril from some villain that I forgot about. Jack Black's role as an avatar for a female cannot go without credit; as well as nailing a difficult personality, we are also presented with moments where the character's gender dilemma provided comedic value. In conclusion, with its video game element, it certainly ticks the 'well, it is different, I guess?' box on the criteria of things to look for in a film. But who cares? The sheer amusement from unique troubles encountered by the dazzling characters is suffice for anyone to feel grateful that they didn't wait for it to air on TV.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
646,sunthrone,"3 Chances, 1 Life",9,7 April 2018,"I can't believe I saw a movie with a cast of Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart AND Jack Black sharing the screen. At the beginning, I thought the scary old man at the Freak House was a throwaway scene meant to show how timid Spencer is but instead he (and the house) were actually relevant to the story and to another main character Alex. I am all for the board game morphing. It's a friggen cursed game, you don't need to follow any rules to have it ""make sense"". Why not, y'know?It makes the dynamics of the main cast in the story better when two of the characters Spencer and Fridge already know each other and had a bond. They know each other's quirks and tempers. The tension between old friends is realistic. An instagram princess in an older man's body is clearly portrayed with the mannerisms and body language is hilarious!! The movie in the middle corrects my theory that the 3 marks on their forearm are just 3 lives. Each mark is a lifebar that's why it drains or takes time for a character to ""die"". Skill set/weaknesses menu was hilarious. In some games the text don't make a lot of sense so the Strength listed under Weakness made me laugh! The amazing reveal when the characters find out why no one could choose Seaplane because he was taken by a guy who's been in the game longer than he thought was both funny and jarring. Inconsistencies with the cutscenes weren't good but I guess some of the bad guy scenes were just for us the audience... perhaps. 4th dimensional?I enjoyed that this movie is actually a continuation of the story with Alan Parrish but we didn't have to sit through some out-of-the-blue revelation of characters making a connection to an urban myth they've heard of Alan like in some movies. Instead, they built on their urban myth of the Alex kid who disappeared! Nice take I must say. I don't even remember much of the other Jumanji movie anyway. And it highlighted the different decades's tech when Alex and Bethany talk about phones.In games I view lives as the number of chances but you really have one life. Martha cleverly used one of her chances to bring a special item knowing that she'll materialize in the game fully intact wherever the farthest character is. Smart! Cute ending too but I felt it was missing something.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

651,daniel_haddad,Humorous and Fun,6,29 December 2017,"""Jumanji"" (2017) is a new adventure that provides you a more in-depth look into the jungle that was introduced by the original ""Jumanji"" film in 1996. Different than the 1996 film, this adaption makes the game of Jumanji relevant to this time by transforming itself into a video game (although I would argue board games are making a come back). For those with positive memories of the 1996 film with Robin Williams, one could be nervous that director Jake Kasdan would ruin that feel-good fighting spirit they found in the original. For that nostalgic among us, the film provides a few subtle ""shout-outs"" to the original film that will happily send you down memory lane. For example, this film begins almost identical to the 1996 version. A boy, Alex (Mason Guccione and Nick Jonas) finds the Jumanji board game while running by the water. When Alex is more interested in his video games, the board game transforms itself into a video game version of itself. While unbelievable that a board game would have that much power, it is not a far stretch of the imagination when you then realize that this game has now sucked multiple people into it...literally. The evil hunter Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) is also reintroduced, though he leaves his normal jungle hunting garb back in the 90s. Additionally, and probably the best throw-back Kasdan included is the reference directly back to William's character, Alan Parrish while we see the new characters in a tree house that Parrish build during his 26 year stay in Jumanji. Kasdan assembled a great cast including Dwayne Johnson (Spencer), Kevin Hart (Fridge), Jack Black (Bethany), Karen Gillan (Martha), and Jonas. Like his previous movies, Kasdan added a lot of humor into this film, which had me and the audience audibly laughing at times. I am beginning to really enjoy the comedic duo that is Hart and Johnson as they complement each other well. The acting was well done across the board and one could tell the actors had a good time making this film. Black's performance must be complimented as it is no small feat to play a cell phone obsessed teenage woman stuck in a body of a middle-aged man. Overall, Jumanji is a new part of the adventure that introduces the story to a new generation and makes it relevant to new viewers. If you go in thinking it is a continuation of the original 1996 film you will be disappointed, however, with fresh eyes one can enjoy the newness of this film and the humor it brings to the Jumanji storyline. Recommendation: Worth the laughs",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
652,victor-14257,A brand new great start,7,7 April 2018,"The old one will always be the best for kids at that time, and it is true that animals show up in real world is more impressive than going into virtual reality.The actors, especially Jack Black did their job pretty well, both kids and adults around me kept laughing during the whole movie and I knew that this is definitely a well designed entertainment.We really miss Robin, and this is a good movie to cheer us up as well as to commemorate him.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

656,w-kazy,Then let's be like this everyday.,9,14 January 2020,"Jumanji is a good film but this sequel is much better .
Making most of the setting being in the video game, this movie keeps nice balanced tension. When I was a child, Jumanji was rather a horror movie than a comedy. Although its ratio is completely reversed, the essence of the horror in this series seems to remain unchanged. That is to say, fear of death. This existence makes the jokes shine much more and prevents the tension from going away. However good what the principle said is, in ordinary situation, it won't impress you. It is not until you realize the end of your life is inevitable that the lines of the principle win the hearts and minds.
I appreciate the actor's fabulous act. Everybody well played each high school student in it. I like the awkward kiss scene the best out of every kiss scene.

660,ronbeebe2,I really must be missing something here,4,9 July 2018,"First off, I cannot tell which age group this was geared towards. 
Second, I may be a bit harsh because I am grading with no curve - the first installment had Robin Williams, a master of comedy. This one had Kevin Hart and The Rock, who together could never be as funny as Robin Williams by himself.
Third, there were so many political intro's in the film that it felt a bit smarmy.
Fourth, I totally get the CGI bit in modern movies, but it has to make SOME sense on SOME level. Several fails in this movie here.
I guess asking for any character development is a bit much for an action/comedy, but I will still ask, and there was minimal, if any, chemistry in this movie. 
Probably best for the 12-17 crowd.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
661,lukefriday,Fun film for the Family,7,6 January 2018,"Not sure what to expect, I went into Jumanji with an open mind. I'm not a huge fan of the original, so was interest in what was in store.This film is definitely action/comedy rather than just action, as the writing seems to treat both aspects with equal importance. The gags are generally funny, but can get too much at times as the film seems to loose focus. Anyone looking for constant action may be disappointed.The characters seem to be chosen to empower various young stereotypes, which can only be a good thing. However, for adults watching alone it may be slightly annoying.

It's entertainment quality is sub-par and the many things it tries to be and how it tries to modernize Jumanji into a video-game doesn't appeal to the majority because the majority of non-video gamers would not understand RPG concepts without being explained about it and even RPG lovers would feel like this is just a gimmick and low-hanging fruit to sell a bad movie.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
665,iitb-pranav,Good but not great,7,30 March 2018,"Jumanji was one of my childhood favorites. The older version, because of its originality, had a good mix of fun, excitement and visual treat. I watched the newer version anticipating it to be the better version of the original idea, but got disappointed. While Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a good entertainment, it lacks the excitement and surprise factors that original movie presented. The plot begins in a very similar manner to the older version but instead of a board game, we see an electronic version of Jumanji. The movie progresses with the characters getting sucked in the game's reality to accomplish the challenge posed by the game's plot. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart successfully carry the responsibility of entertaining the audience but the story-line doesn't allow the characters to be memorable. The movie contains a few scattered pieces of good entertainment that makes you laugh. Like the original version, new Jumanji carries many special effects and welcomes you to the Jungle as name suggests. But we are in the year 2017 - I expected a bit more from the visual effects.
Overall, it's a good entertainer but is just an incremental improvement from the original version.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

669,justin-811-756423,Pleasantly surprised,9,24 December 2020,"I really thought this movie would suck. I thought it was a reboot, which I usually don't care for but it's more of a sequel. And like reboots, sequels also often suck but this one doesn't. Not only is it very funny but I thought the acting was pretty good as well; this time Jumanji is a console game and the main characters get pulled into the game and get the body of the avatar they chose but they still have their original personality which doesn't always match the persona of the avatar. So as an actor you have to do a credible impersonation of a fictional personality in the body of another fictional personality. I also liked the fact that they really managed to incorporate a lot of console game features into the movie so it really feels like they are in a game; each player has 3 lives and different strengths and weaknesses, there's a map of the level and the game characters actually resemble those of a real console game. I also loved the fact that put Jack Black in the movie because that guy rocks.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
670,Isabelle_Frost,A great story with a great action and good acting,9,27 June 2018,"Oh my gosh, where should I start? This movie was simply awesome. At first, I was very skeptical about it because I knew how good was the first Jumanji movie, however I decided to give it a try and it was absolutely worth it. The story is very well constructed as the audience can quickly understand the plot, without being puzzled or confused which would've been frustrating, of course. From the very beginning you can see the main cause that leads to the entire action, which for me is awesome, because I hate movies who need like an hour in order to get into action and they are boring the audience until then. I appreciated the combination between the entire action and comedy elements which were extremely well introduced and executed by the actors. The dialogues between the characters are cursive, without many ""dead moments"" and easy to follow. The characters are also very diverse and well-constructed as we have some stereotypes here: the nerd, the hot girl, the tough guy and the shy girl. Exactly this diversity between them helps the characters to form a team and fulfill their objective: rescue Jumanji. What's even more interesting is that this stereotypes are switching between them as soon as the characters are entering the game.What could've been done better about this movie is the CGI which is rather acceptable, than good, but oh well, you cannot have them all in a movie, right? Overall, this movie deserves your time and I recommend it, especially to those of you who are gamers.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
671,bionicbaby1,Great Remake,9,3 March 2018,This movie was great from start to finish. I really liked how they done this one using the finesse of how kids today prefer video games to board games.

The chemistry between the cast is amazing, coupled with some good punches it manages to keep the movie afloat.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

No wonder it's clocking close to a billion dollars in collection. It's a waste of time and money.

No actual thrill of adventure or danger with a story like this, it's as though the whole film was just a big set up for a laugh and that's it.The villain was not even a villain, played absolutely no role in the story whatsoever and played no threat to the main characters.Kevin Hart, again, being the scaredy cat of the cast and shouting his lines out to the audience as per usual, seems like the easiest job in the world today, although i have to say still the funniest (regardless of how forced the jokes were).Lost all respect for Jack Black taking this role on, then again it's not as if he's a big time actor anyway so this fits the bill for him.Karen was just eye candy because fan-boys demand it. thats all. This one was frustrating because its not the worst film I have seen but I would not look to this film for a laugh or enjoyment of any sort, it's just another project on DJ's CV, he's got his star on the walk of fame now, he can just hang up the towel now. To add, if you're going to create a character name for this guy, don't have it be the same first name he's already portrayed from Ballers, because if anyone watches that show, that's all they're gonna be thinking about when his name is mentioned.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

In Jumanji 2, 4 characters get stuck in a jungle. Each character has 3 lives. They need to put a stone in a statue to go back home.
 When I went to the the theaters to watch this movie, the line was very long but it was worth waiting. The movie was the funniest I have ever seen. There was lot's of action but also a lot of humor. Laughs came everywhere.

678,editionsnl,3/10,3,31 December 2017,"Using the washroom after viewing this movie had me more on the edge of my seat than the film itself. Average cinematography, the characters were stereotypical and boring, the plot was highly predictable and trite (as in, there was no part of the entire movie that caught me off guard or that I didn't expect), and the scenes that were apparently meant to be suspenseful or exciting were not. The film was full of cheesy, forced dialogue and pointless romantic subplots (one of my biggest pet peeves in action/adventure movies). It did have a few funny moments, which is just about the only thing that made me give it higher than a 1/10 rating.It's not the worst thing I've seen in my life, and to be fair I don't usually watch this genre of movie (it was the one my cousin wanted to see), but around halfway through I definitely was bored and looking forward to the end.

For example in the first jumanji all the creatures that came out of the board were not in this film. I also think some sort of reference could of been made to robin williams .A few things did play on my mind like why did Alan from the first jumanji and the boy who had been there for twenty years not just gone into the village and made a new life for themself.

682,eicarbuckle,An impressive and fun sequel,7,21 March 2018,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle 
2017Fun movie. I was impressed. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has come along way over the years. At the beginning of his acting career I really didn't like The Rock. Perhaps I was persuaded by his pathetic and embarrassing performance as a wrestler. But recently, I've become a fan of The Rock and feel he's becoming a quality actor. I was skeptical about this movie from the beginning but was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I found myself laughing throughout. Not to mention it keeps making money at the box office.The movie is about a group of misfits in detention that stumble across a vintage video game system. When they set it up and begin to play they are sucked into the game actually becoming the individual characters of the game, complete with a number of lives, strengths and weaknesses. The film is convincing as an actual video game and gives video games styles appropriate credit. The action and visual effects are impressive and entertaining. Jack Black gives a convincing performance as a ditzy, popular, sexy blond that is addicted to her phone. Johnson seems to be the typical role as the strong hero with no weaknesses that seems to lead the team. Kevin Hart is his usual self as Fridge, a small whiney character in the game, a very different person than the football jock from the real world. (Assume that's where his name 'Fridge' comes from) He seems to have an insignificant role as Johnson's side kick, but quickly adapts, accepts and contributes. My favorite character was Martha, the nerdy girl that seems to see the world clearly with all its superficial and unimportant elements. She becomes a martial arts babe who has a sexy and rare ability for dance fighting. See the movie for more info, I don't want to spoil anything. Her performance is funny and entertaining. I love the way she kicks some tail and thinks through situations assisting the team. Because the film takes place in a video game setting some action is convincing and believable when in other movies it might appear ridiculous or far fetched. Flying a helicopter sideways for example. In a Mission Impossible movie it may force us to roll our eyes and mutter: ""Seriously? Come on."" It has the ability to exaggerate reality laws, much like the Matrix movies. I was a little disappointed with a few inappropriate and completely unnecessary sexual jokes and some romantic drama that was included in the story that didn't seem to fit. Some may appreciate it, but I felt the film could have done without it. Can I mention this? I know others are hesitant to address it. In every movie Johnson shows off his impressive chest tribal tattoo. Instead of seeing the character in the movie I see The Rock, playing that character. The Rock looks the exact same in every film he is in. Just like Baywatch, a post for another time, instead of Mitch Buchannon, I'm seeing Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson playing a lifeguard in a movie. The same goes for every other recent movie Johnson has been in. We all know his tattoo, and what it looks like. It's as if Johnson refuses to be anyone else, other than himself, for any movie. Fast and Furious? San Andreas? GI Joe? See where I'm going with this? Could we please have hair and makeup strive to show some effort in converting Johnson into the actual character in the film? Do I even need to add a reference to the character transformation of Gary Oldman for the film Darkest Hour here?I really do miss PG movies that are appropriate for all ages. They seem to be very rare now days. It would have been nice if a little bit of unnecessary content would have been filtered from this movie to give it the PG rating, so that kids could enjoy it as well.Overall the movie was a lot of fun. One I'd see again and recommend to others. I can see why it keeps making money at the box office.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

687,adamfranklyn-83460,A worthy sequel,7,22 September 2018,"I don't usually leave reviews, however with Jumanji being a very iconic movie from my child hood, I felt a review would be needed. I like the way how the film has changed along with times, in 1995 Jumani, you had the board game, and the same with Zathura. Fast forward to 2018 and everything is pretty much virtual. The acting was absolutely fantastic, Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart were absolutely brilliant with Jack Black providing many laugh out loud moments. Karen Gillen stood tall in the movie and performed amazingly well. Her character was very memorable and bad ass (I kept expecting Matt Smith to pop up every time she was on screen)Why a 7 out of 10 though? For me personally to rate a movie 10 out of 10, it has to tick many boxes, and when it's a remake or sequel to an iconic classic movie, 10 out of 10 is near impossible. A perfect example of this would be Jurassic world, a movie I absolutely loved but only rated a 7 because it didn't stand toe to toe with the original. There was far to much comedy and not enough dark moments in this movie which I felt let it down.

The writing and storyline is so funny and entertaining and the acting is off the charts.The CGI isn't amazing but it actually makes the film better because it gives you the sense that the characters are in a video game and it's supposed to look a little automated.Even though there is a lot of profanity and sexual references in the film they're actually really obvious and as a kid I knew to ignore them because they're very up front and easy to notice.WATCH THE MOVIE NOW !!!!,Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

There's definitely a nostalgic 80's feel to this movie as well as modern take which appeals to all. The action was great and comedy was unexpected.

Secondly, the only link it had to the first movie was Van pelt and the name Alan Perrish scribbed on a piece of wood in a jungle. the first movie was iconic for it's fantasy look animals and plant, and mischief monkey, persistent flesh eating plants, and the grunting and panting baby running Rhino, in additional to the new animal threats, they should have at least featured them in the second movie.. it would have been a plus...

717,hunnhayley,Funny scenes at times but certain points too sexual/over explained. Some spoilers in review.,5,22 December 2017,"Too many sexual references to Jack Black's private parts. Some points of movie leave audience confused, especially with all the over explaining each actor does with their assigned game character's power abilities. It seemed like overkill. Overall, with certain scenes being too slow due to the over explanations and jumping around too much (like when Joe Jonas contemplates flying. He first repeatedly says ""I can't do it!"" because he never used his character's power of aviation in 20 years inside game) but then after a long spiel of how he's the only one that can get them out of the current situation, he then all of a sudden has courage and says, ""reporting for duty."" Would have been less confusing to just say ""I've never flown but let's do this."" Back and forth with no's and yes's, and no I'm scared, no wait you're right I can do it, no you're the one with the power, etc. is why it felt like overkill, too many explanations and jumping around. It happened with Dwayne Johnson's character, too, when he's confronted with the snake. And, instead, Kevin Hart ends the scene a hero. Just too jumpy to fully enjoy.There's another scene where the characters find out their powers and one says ""How did you do that?"" Dwayne Johnson says something like, ""I just touched my peck"" and the red headed female character (sorry, unfamiliar with her real name) tries to touch her chest in same manner but doesn't work so Kevin Hart says something like, ""Let me help, I think you need to touch higher"" and she swats his hand away. Not a fan of films encouraging sexual harassment. The audience didn't laugh at most of the sexually natured scenes because they were just uncomfortable, especially with all the sexual assault allegations going on in Hollywood right now. I would not recommend to take your kids to this film, it's not kid friendly like the 1995 version. Jumpy scenes combined with the overly sexualized references to Jack Black's private parts and other sexual references, 5 stars.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

731,jkyungmkyung,"About what you'd expect, but a bit more complex",8,23 January 2018,"Just a disclaimer: I haven't seen the original Jumanji, so I am not sure if this changes my opinion. So, anyway, this is about what you'd expect from a Kevin Hart and the Rock movie, good, funny, kinda dumb. It's very funny, but it is simple, and doesn't give much more meaning than what is displayed directly on screen. There are quite a few good jokes that weren't spoiled by any of the trailers. It has more story than Central Intelligence, but not as many jokes. It also has more character development and more complex jokes. I honestly prefer Jumanji to Central Intelligence, merely because it is more complex than other Dwayne Johnson movies. Getting into the nitty-gritty details, the camera angles during the fight scenes are completely awful, with that whiplash-inducing cut every second mentality that seems to be becoming ever more common in Hollywood movies. The acting is good, I mean it has Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black, so how bad could it be? The writing is also pretty good as well. There was really only one joke that really grated me, as well as the fact that nothing was explained about the game itself. Being a geek myself it really frustrated me that they didn't go deeper into this anonymous video game console, but at this point I am nitpicking. I don't want to spoil anything, but the way that the game ends makes it very unlikely that there will be a remake, which in my opinion would have been cool to see.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

I remember not really liking the original as a kid because I thought it was boring, so I didn't bother to watch this until four years after it came out, and its MUCH more entertaining. It moves at a fast-pace, with the perfect balance of team-building, comedy and action. And yes, they could've gone a little deeper with some of the relationships, but you aren't here to watch that. You're here to watch a cool, action-packed adventure movie, with high stakes and entertaining dialogue and humor.

There are so many things wrong with this movie and it's almost nothing like the original:The setup to the movie is terrible, it's like they couldn't come up with a good way to make the video game plot happen so they were just like Alex's friend find the board on the beach and brings it home to him, he says ""Psh, who plays board games anymore!"" because it's 1996 and video games are all the rage, and during the night the INSIDE of the board turns into a video game. WTF? Also the game cartridge looks to be from an Atari system....isn't this supposed to be 1996? Atari came out in the 70s and 80s! Couldn't they have splurged a little and purchased a license to make a Genesis/SNES/N64 cartridge or a Playstation CD....considering that's what console he was playing?! Also where does he get this random console from? He just happened to have it laying around? The high school drama scene wasn't that bad, what was worse though was the ""getting sucked into the game"" bit, it was so cheesy with the whole ""lets play this old video game instead of ripping staples out of magazines"" and then of course sparks fly from it like it's a big computer..The rest of the movie is with the real stars, and the acting is great, which you would expect from these four. Karen Gillan looks phenomenally sexy and was pretty much the only reason why I kept watching it.Once they're in the game, almost nothing reminds you that this is a Jumanji movie, other than the fact that they keep referencing it. They get chased by guys on motorcycles and a few animals. Big whoop. Where's the hunter that was trying to kill everyone in the original? Where are the monkeys? The quicksand? The spiders? The monsoons? The tiger? I didn't care about the characters at all (once in the game), they were poorly developed and it was just a ""race to the end"". Whenever they were safe, the motorcycle guys appeared, couldn't they have come up with better villains? They get out of the game, and of course they're all friends now! Who would have thought?! After watching it, it totally felt like The Breakfast club mixed with a horrible 90s sucked into the video game plot.Maybe if I was a kid or a young teenager, and hadn't seen the original I would have liked it.

755,ashley-nagy,A Family friendly film,6,14 September 2018,"Jumanji is one of those movies that you must watch every single time it comes on TV. It doesn't matter how old I am, or what I'm doing, Jumanji is getting watched! Robin Williams performance in the film was phenomenal, and personally, one of my favorites. This being said, I was very weary about the new Jumanji coming out. I knew for sure thy would ruin it. No way could they compete with the modern classic!! 22 years later & all I could gather up were low expectations and mild interests.
However, given my low enthusiasm of this film, I was pleasantly surprised by how ""fun"" the movie is. The movie theatre actually filled with laughter (mine included). You couldn't help but smile your way through it. Given the all the components (Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black) comedy is sure to ensue. And let's face it...anytime Kevin & Dwayne do anything on screen together, I don't care what it is, I'm there.Unfortunately, I will say that Kevin Hart is exactly that in this movie, Kevin Hart. We all know his humor, and to be honest it is getting sort of old and routine. His comedic style is very predictable and sometimes overdone. Jack Black (Bethany) delivers a great performance with his rendition of a white teenage girl that will have you laughing the whole way through. His one-liners kept a smile on my face the whole movie, and surprisingly he became my favorite character.
Going into this movie, I had to keep reminding myself that it is not, by any means, a remake of the original. There were very scarce similarities, and I found that as an upside. I loved the fact that the film tried to stand on its own. They weren't trying to recreate and redo this classic that they could potentially ruin. Going in with an open mind really helped me enjoy this new Jumanji film. It delivers a continuation of the film with some major modern updates for the 2000 generation.
""Jumanji"" (1995) was thrilling and chilling. You're lying if you say you weren't terrified of those humongous spiders or Van Pelt with his shotgun. ""In the jungle you must wait, until the dice read 5 or 8"" was my constant reminder to NEVER play Jumanji, even if the board game was bought at the nearest Walmart. However, ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,"" was not scary or thrilling at all. It definitely is more comedic than adventurous, which depending on your preferred genre, may be a plus or negative to you.
It is definitely a great film for the family to see together right around the holidays, just don't count on any Oscar nominations any time soon 😊",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
756,Kazoramoney,10/10 Pure Enjoyment and Laughs!,10,28 December 2017,"I'll start off by saying that I've watched the first Jumanji way back in the day as well as Zathura when it came out. And I am happy to report that this movie was everything I hoped for and more! When I first saw the trailer I already knew this movie was gonna be an enjoyable ride that I can watch easily with my friends. Or if you don't have friends, well guess what?! This movie is perfect still for some self-indulgence! I had no idea why some people were saying that this movie was going to bombed because it clearly won't to me at least. It has a star-studded cast who were all excellent in their respective roles. I was actually surprise to see Nick Jonas here! Haven't seen him for a while and he putted up a great act. Jumanji captures all the essence of old school video games and the 90s. Since this movie is made by Sony Pictures you will see tons of Sony games like Uncharted 3 in the kid's room. That was really cool that they put it in there being a Sony fan myself. ALL IN ALL GO OUT AND BUY A TICKET FOR THIS MOVIE NOW!!!",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

765,jasonz-69711,"""THEY'RE MAKING A JUMANJI SEQUEL? HOW COULD THEY? IS NOTHING SACRED???",7,10 March 2018,"That was my initial reaction when Sony announced that they were revisiting the Robin Williams led classic. ""Great, another studio exploiting an irreplacable movie just for the cash."" But I was pleasantly surprised by the trailer so I was curious and honestly, after watching it, this is a pretty solid movie.The basic premise is that four kids in detention (with a bit of a Breakfast Club dynamic) find an old video game called ""Jumanji"" and are immediately sucked into the game and have to fight their way through the jungle as their characters.They could not have picked a better cast, in my opinion. Jack Black and The Rock (whom I refuse to call by his real name) especially were able to pull off characters that were outside of their usual roles. The Rock as the archetypal nerd whose avatar is a strong, muscular adventurer, and Jack Black as the popular girl who gets stuck as an older overweight cartographer guarantee laughs. But I don't want to underplay Kevin Hart and Karen Gillans performances. Kevin Hart as the jock playing as a short zoologist and Gillan as an outcast who plays as a commando and ""killer of men."" I'd imagine it's difficult for an adult to convincingly play a teenager without overdoing it but luckily, this cast has it covered. Despite being comedic characters they each have an arc that balances out the more goofy moments and add heart, which I was expecting this film would lack.This accompanied by a clever script in a very video game setting, they did well portraying live action video game play complete with cut scenes and side quests nostalgic of similar styled video games from the 90s. I was also relieved that they didn't try to oversaturate it with references to the original. There was one blink-if-you-miss-it moment that was brief but satisfying.Overall this is a fun movie that makes you laugh and gives you enough adventure action to warrant the title.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

770,royalmoosemovie,"FUN, NOT FUNNY",7,22 December 2017,"Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle is a sequel to the 1995 original starring Robin Williams as a man who stumbles upon a magic board game that brings the elements of the game into the real world. The sequel takes a different turn to catch up with the current craze: VIDEO GAMES. The film stars Dwayne ""The Rock Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black as the avatars of four teenagers who were sucked into the game. If you've seen the cast or watched the trailers, you'd probably go into this film thinking its a comedy. IT'S NOT(at least not a good one). Most of the jokes in this film where already shown in the trailers, and the ones that weren't didn't really click well. But where one aspect of this film falls short, another stands tall and that is the action. The action scenes in this film are beautifully choreographed, from motorcycle chases to the dance fights the film always exceeds my expectations(it also doesn't hurt that the cast does most of their own stunts).  Speaking of the cast, they're a bit of a mixed bag. I usually love Kevin Hart but he doesn't really work in this film because of the setup with his teenage counterpart who is a confident, VERY SERIOUS, jock. Kevin Hart is basically just playing Kevin Hart which works a lot, but not here. Dwayne Johnson is lacking a lot in this film, yes he does great in action sequences, but when it comes to the serious heartfelt moments(which the film has)he doesn't deliver. Karen Gillan and Jack Black are the real stars here. Jack Black plays a great typical teenage mean girl, and Karen Gillan really proves that she can hold her ground with the big names around her. Not to mention, that she has the BEST action scenes in the film. Gamers who go and watch this film will have an especially good time with the film's nods and respect to the video game format, The NPC(non player character)gags, work really well, even with the general audience and the dramatic cutscene with the players commenting is a nice add in. The villain in this film is bad but that makes him good, most video game villains are usually handsome, one dimensional characters, who just want to destroy the world and that exactly what this villain is and why it works. The film shoots on location in Hawaii which leads to some great set pieces and makes the film more believable really amercing the audience into the world of Jumanji. The CGI in the film is also very well done for a film with a smaller budget. Surprisingly, this film has very well written screenplay which leads to some actual emotional and heartfelt moments, if only those moments were performed with real emotion and genuine acting. Sadly there not, most of these moments center around a character who has been trapped in the game for about 20 years. This character is played by Nick Jonas and it really, really does not work out well most of the film he over acts and cant even sell his comedy. Jumanji: Welcome To Jungle is one of the delightful surprises of 2017, delivering a fun ""Popcorn and Soda"" flick to watch with your friends and family in the theater on a holiday weekend.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

The performance was well from the boy who got lost in the video game he thought it was 1996 but he was wearing a metallica shirt from 1985; another prop gone wrong.

777,granzer,Very Enjoyable,9,10 January 2018,"If you were a fan of the original, you will definitely enjoy this. It does have references to the original. It also takes a new perspective. The original was a board game that had things coming out that the players has to interact with (unless you were sucked in). In this, the board game realises people play game consoles and adapts to it (to make it appealing to the newer age group). The players are sucked into the game (no option for things to come out - which is disappointing) as the avatars they chose and have to complete a mission with different 'levels' (which are different areas of a map). The humour is very good (jack black playing a woman in a mans body for one). The trailer doesn't show all the good bits so there's nothing to worry about there.

783,galexand-32550,"Fun to watch for all, but not the same",6,31 December 2017,"My family went to see this in the theater. I was very excited as the first movie was a big hit for me and I had really enjoyed it. Because of this, I had very high hopes going into the theater.The 4 main characters are sent to detention where they find a videogame changed from a board game that sucks them into it. To get out they have to play the game as a regular video game as their avatars, and not die while doing so. Dwayne Johnson is very well known and has a lot of credit in movies, but in this one he didn't have that click that he always does, perhaps because he was playing a nerdy kid. Kevin Hart's character was funny and entertaining to keep up with, and laughs went all around the theater when he cracked jokes. But Karen Gillan and Jack Black really kept the amusement going. Karen Gillan played another nerdy character but showed extraordinary character devolpment in a hilarious way. Jack Black was a gem as usual. He played a popular teenage girl with classic high school problems, and this really clicked for me.Meanwhile, I had also hoped that there would be some ties back to the first film in 1995, but unfortunately there were not many, only a couple here and there. Something that disappointed my inside kid was the fact that this board game changed into a video game, it didn't seem very realistic and I believe there could have been a lot of success if they had kept it as a board game and been sucked into there the same way Alan Parrish was.Either way, the film was entertaining for what it was and I would recommend for all who enjoy action with a touch of comedy!",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

I was not bored for a second and the movie constantly kept you entertained with a variety of comedy. In my opinion, I enjoyed watching this movie more than the Rovbin William original.

788,alessandrowoodbridge,Critics undersell a fantastic movie,10,24 December 2017,"I would watch this movie two more times at least. This was a very funny movie. Arguably one of the best performance Jack Black has done. When I watched this with my family, in a packed movie theatre, I kid you not, the entire cinema was laughing during quite a few of the scenes. The humour is excellently tailored to the audience and is a beautiful tribute to the original Jumanji with Robin Williams. The way it fantastically coincides with the original movie and moves onto a sort of sequel to this is beautiful, and a rare thing these days. The movie is very funny and easily one of the greatest movies to have come out this year. It is certainly in the top 15 movies that have come out, post 2010, accompanied with the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool and now the recent movie that just came out, Bright. If you felt that Bright was also under-appreciated by movie critics, the exact same thing has happened here as Jumanji is a 100% gaurantee, a movie that will be appreciated after watching. Personally, I would watch it again and again with people. It is not just a movie to watch and discard, this is one to put on the bookshelf and watch again in the future. Loved it.

It's good. I had no idea what to expect in all honest. I am not huge fans of other movies by these actors, but this really worked. You could see the great chemistry between them all and it paid off.What I liked: I enjoyed how it didn't dither about at the beginning and got right into the action. Jack Black especially was brilliant and hilarious! All the actors/actresses were great but Jack Black stood out. Good mix of action and comedy throughout. I was on the edge of my seat (metaphorically) wanting them to escape the game.Negatives: not many to be honest, couple of scenes were slightly cringe, but not off putting. Same logic goes for a couple of scenes which felt dragged out.I think people need to forget about this being a remake of a classic film and treat it as a separate movie altogether.

The film is set up so well that it does not feel like another copy of Jumanji, but instead its own original plot. The cast is paired so well, the movie is easy to stay interested in their hilarious connection that keeps its audience laughing. The cast accurately captures their roles as high school students from many social stances.

It has so many aspects such as comedy, action, fantasy, adventure. The best one is its comedy the movie uses old a new joke that makes the character funny and the cast fits the character very well like the main character is casted by Dwayne Johnson which is considered one of the best comedy actors while in some movies that he cast are comedy and action. Every gesture, every note from The Rock, Kevin Hart and Jack Black are perfection they're no negativity in the movie which make the main casts very comfortable in each of their role. Not to mention it does not abandon its traditional Jumanji movie from the 90s a classic game that turns into reality people who goes into the game. Jumanji welcome to the forest also has a very great story and plot the movie has many plot twist and amazing quality for a movie in 2017 the side character and villain in Jumanji also makes it like a live adventure which refreshes the viewer's mind. There is no boring moment in the movie and the cast very knows they're own character which make it very lively. Although the movie is great in its own element for some people, they need drama which is the most lacking one here although in some cases they are some but most of them are covered by its comedy aspect.Best comedy, action movie.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
820,WillG-2002,A disappointing sequel to the 1995 original that fell short of expectations.,3,10 September 2021,"If you were looking at this movie because it stars Dwayne Johnson and you wanted an easy-going movie to watch that would give you some laughs along the way, then Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is probably for you. However, as someone who was hoping for more than what felt like a re-heated and poorly executed sequel to Joe Johnston's 1995 original Jumanji, I was left sorely disappointed.The movie starts off as you'd expect, you have some high-school kids who stumble upon the Jumanji board-game, and curiosity gets the better of them and they decide to play the game. Anyway, here's where I was hoping things would get more interesting - as director Jake Kasden took the really intriguing decision to actually set the game inside of the Jumanji universe this time, rather than the game just taking place in the real-world as the character rolls the dice. This was where I was left most disappointed, because I felt that with the setting of the Jungle, this provided so much room for creative license and all-new interpretations for how the game could play out, and yet this is where Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle falls far short of my expectations. Despite the gripping setting and endless potential, the movie failed to hook me in as I thought it would, and for the first hour or so I found myself rather bored, yet at the same time amazed, thinking that surely it's got to get better at some point.That's not to say the movie fails in all aspects, as far as humour goes there were several moments in the story where I did find myself laughing, as the Director clearly has taken the decision not to have the story take itself too seriously. My immersion was taken away from the game because I didn't feel that the risks to the characters were as great as they were in the original movie, and I feel as though the movie strays too far in the direction of humour and inventing new elements to the game that just feel as though they do not fit with how the original Director, Joe Johnston, interpreted the game. For example, the characters all have lives, which was a surprise to me at first, but I was interested to see whether they would be executed in an interesting way or just feel like an unnecessary addition to the game. Unfortunately it ended up being the latter, as in my view they added nothing of interest to the story, and if anything just made the game even less immersive - whereas I felt the 1995 original was at least somewhat more immersive, and you felt as though the risks to those playing the game were real.In addition, the characters in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle I felt were just too uninteresting, as you have the stereotypical nerdy college kid who falls in love with a shy girl, and then you're just spending the rest of the movie knowing exactly what's going to happen in the final scene. This would be fine if I found the characters interesting, but I just don't. The romance element just feels really tacked on in the sequel, and considering this plotline of the protagonist falling in love with the girl he is playing the game with is in the original, I was hoping that they would do something different for the sequel.Anyway, I'll wrap this up now because I'd prefer my reviews to be succint and to the point. Did I have a bad time watching this movie? No, I wouldn't say that. I still enjoyed parts of it, the humour was overall pretty good, apart from where it could feel tacked on and out of place. My biggest disappointment was the wasted potential with this movie being made over 20 years after the original Jumanji, it just felt as though the Director was more focused on the dynamic between the characters and making the audience laugh than creating a new and exciting interpretation of Jumanji, leaving me feeling bored at several points during the movie. Hopefully the 2019 sequel is better!",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
821,daveymullen,"Good fun, if a little forgettable",7,5 January 2018,"This is my first review on here. Now normally people reserve their first review to make sweeping negative statements on films they've just seen, or to rave about something while it's still fresh in their head and they're still full of that post-cinema buzz.This review is neither, and is more for me to make some honest remarks about a film I enjoyed, but later found it to have to unnecessary criticisms on these pages.I am no ""critique"" and when I go to see such films, I appreciate that a little bit of your brain should be switched off in order to just enjoy these films for what they are. You shouldn't be expecting Oscar performances, or epic twists etc. if you are expecting that, you shouldn't waste your time with these types of films. Why go see this film at all if that is your mindset? You do kind of know what you're getting yourself in to right?Secondly, while this film shares it's name with the original, I wouldn't put it down as a remake, rather, it's much more of a modern interpretation/adaptation. So I wouldn't really compare the old and new films directly - although people will continue to do so.So with the above in mind, this IS a good fun, action/comedy film that I think all of the family would enjoy. What I will say is that some of the humour was a bit flat and forgetful and that the general pacing was too fast. The way each character discovered their abilities for example was lame and really felt like it hadn't been given much thought. Considering this was, for myself at least, one of the main attractions of a modern Jumanji made out to be like a video game, this was a massive opportunity wasted and would have really clicked with the more nerdy members of the audience, such as myself, had they just given this area more thought. The ending was a bit cheesy, even for the cheesiest of folk, although I have to admit it did give me that happy warm feeling you sometimes get, so I won't complain too much.If you want a classic 2 hours of popcorn busting fun which doesn't have to be taken seriously at all - go and give it a watch.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
822,MRAJful,Fun time in the cinema,7,23 December 2017,"Fresh out of the Star Wars film, I went to watch this film having 0 expectations, and boy, did it entertain! It was funny, exciting and overall a good time in the cinema. The cast did a good job, with Jack Black being the highlight as teen chick trapped in an obese, middle-aged man. The whole videogame aspect of the film was something that seemed rather unique to the film (it could be that I've not seen enough films based on video games)
I personally thought Kevin Hart is as annoying as he is, but the bits involving him blurting out useless information on the animals were funny (and the scene in the market was Hilarious). And the villain was just, well, there. He doesn't do much, he says something about a stone and then vanishes in the end. I found him a little useless, and it could've been reworked.

844,Ybd1000,The Jumanji movie you did not know you need,9,12 January 2018,"When the first trailer came out for this movie I was immediately upset. I was worried that this movie was gonna completely destroy the beloved Robin Williams that I grew up watching. I have been proven wrong. This movie is amazing. This is Kevin Hart's best movie yet and Jack Black's best movie since School of Rock. The movie combines intense fast pace action with gut busting comedy. The scene when Kevin Hart's character eats cake, which is his weakness, and then explodes had me throwing a laughing fit in the theater. The names of the characters are also amazing. Jack Black is the curvy genius, The Rock is Dr. Smolder Bravestone which is basically who The Rock is in all of his movies. The music in this movie is absolutely phenomenal. When you hear those drums banging you know 2 things. The first is that you are scared because you have no idea what is going to happen. The second is that the characters are progressing the story of the game. As an avid gamer myself I felt that all of the actual video game bits were very well done. The non playable characters in the movie such as Nigel react just as you would expect. They only have a certain amount of lines they can say so the characters can not talk themselves out of anything they need to properly play the game and use their abilities. The action was riveting with The Rock having such superhuman strength. That is why this movie really shined for me. The roles each actor had. The scared nerdy kid becomes the most unstoppable man that has nothing to fear in The Rock. The big athlete becomes the small and weak looking Kevin Hart. The shy and to her self girl becomes the sexy man killer in Karen Gillan. The looks obsessed teenage girl becomes the overweight Jack Black. Which by the way was my favorite part of the movie. Jack Black playing a stereotypical teenage white girl had me in stitches every time he did or said anything. The scene when the teenage girl has to pee in the body of Jack Black was a non stop laugh riot the entire time. I found that every prediction I made for this movie was wrong. This movie is astounding.The only down side of this film is when they are not in the game. It makes up less than 30 minutes of screen time probably but it is a little boring. Then after the kids get out of the game their lives are better and the scenes are a lot more enjoyable since we now know these characters a lot better.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
845,MediaCritic8,awful movie dull humor and all over the place,4,24 December 2017,"Have been a big fan of Jumanji, who did not just have a pivotal role played by Robin Williams but had a fantastic supporting cast; and perhaps the best aspect was in its simplicity of screenplay in which the metaphysical twined with their existence and how wilderness and its creatures invade urban lives.The 2017 remake however chose to bring urban bike gangsters into a jungle adventure and not even the wit and charm of Dwayne Johnson could install life into the movie.

864,cerdajosemanuel,Many mistakes and terrible ending,2,16 March 2018,"I decided to watch this movie after watching the original Jumanji of 1995. I do understand that as this movie was released in 2017, they had to make some changes to adapt the plot to society nowadays. That is how the board game turned into a video game, and that's ok. They need to do this to make it more understandable for modern society. Nevertheless, what I hate the most is that they missed important details in the plot, and I mean VERY IMPORTANT ones.
First, in the original one, Alan realizes that he has been inside the game for years and years. He even miss track of time. Although in this movie, Alex (Alex... Alan... Alex... Alan...), has no idea that he spent twenty years in the jungle. He only thinks that he has been a couple of months.
Second, having in mind the original movie, if the game starts in 1996, once it finishes, life should continue from 1996. This means that no alternate future was created. In the original movie Alan and Sarah return to their lives, and do live until they are adult and then they meet Peter and Judy.

It wasn't a film that was trying to hard to be funny, as I think the actors played their roles really well and can't think of anyone else who could have played them better.
The unlikely group thrown together in chaos, create a heroic group of teens. Which I think also creates a lot of meaningful moments at the same time as it being amusing as they learn to over come hurdles in the jungle that they are able to relate to In the real world.This is definitely a comedic film that you shouldn't watch if you naturally pick films apart, as it really is a film I would put on to smile.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

We all laughed out loud, jumped in surprise a few times and left the theatre feeling happy. What more can you ask for in a comedy? I am not sure of it's PG13 rating, being that I was there with other people's children I tried to be very aware of situational issues, language etc. and beyond a few jokes about male genetalia, it was relatively tame.

The cast are largely playing against type; the interplay between the characters is fun; the set pieces are inventive and silly. However, this movie is predictable with a very linear plot and only moments of jeopardy for the characters. Any situation they find themselves in, they immediately dig themselves out of, and we kind of know what's going to happen before they do.The introduction to the real-life version of the characters, before the Jumanji-world scenes is long and drawn out, most likely a misguided attempt to make us appreciate the resolution of their character journeys, which is predictable and superficial.It's hard to know who this is really aimed at, with a blend of teen humour and simplistic kids' movie action.That said, it romps along, has plenty of action and CGI that looks like CGI, but you don't really care, and gives a modern twist to the original Jumanji concept.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

And why did the movie keep going and going for so long -- over two hours I think???I really have to think twice before I just Rotten Tomatoes or other sites these days. No way that this thing got an audience 90. A bunch of 7-10 year old boys at the movie loved it.. outside of that.... ouch. And in the movie .. this is very awkward... The Rock who is 45 has a scene sloppily kissing an actress playing a 15 year old, Was this directed Polanski or Kevin Spacey? And.. it gets worse.. Jack Black .. hits on a teenage boy as if he was a teenage girl and makes a reference to sprouting wood over the teen boy.. I swear this is true.. Very Very Very unsettling no matter how the story line tries to makes it okay for a 45 year old to be making out with a girl playing a 15 year old.. Am I wrong???So.. what more can I say..

I was very pleasantly surprised. Not only is it funny and exciting throughout but also the comedy and story are directly related. All the teens are changed to have bodies and skills that are the exact opposite of theirs, not only for comedic purposes but also to help each of them overcome their weaknesses. Many have complained that the story was incredibly cliche and that the whole story can be summed up by ""kids get sucked in, fight,and get out"", but thats not what this is about at all. This movie is first and foremost about the teens themselves (even though they have very little screen time). I'd like to say that my screening was filled with teens adults and much older people, and they were all laughing. This movie isn't neccesarily new or fresh but its a good fun movie. If you didn't enjoy this movie it's because you couldn't, cause you didn't let yourself enjoy it.

That being said, my expectations were pretty low; if I'd gone in wanting to see the movie and expecting it to be good, I probably would have been like 'meh'. Surprisingly, (at least for me), Jack Black MADE the movie. They must have had the kids act out the scenes and then the adults recreate their expressions and mannerisms and what not, because Jack Black NAILED the teenage girl thing (and I'm a 19 y/o female). He wasn't over-the-top or stereotypical & demeaning, just super funny and spot on, and both my teenage sisters agree.

The duo of Kevin Hart and The Rock are hilarious but I didn't expect Jack Black to be so funny. Each character brought different kinds of laughs throughout the entire movie that you can relate to someway.

I personally just felt that there wasn't any intense moments that made you jump out of your seat, or compassionate moments that made you smile. I understand the route they went, but it was too focused on comedy, and quite a lot of unrealistic things. In Jumanji 1995, the scene with the lion, I was scared, almost as scared as the children, but in this Jumanji, not once did I not feel that they wouldn't make finish the journey, not once did I feel as though they should be scared. It had to switch every good or romantic or even thriller moments into something funny. The story was lighthearted and not intense enough, the script needed improvement but everything else was great.

So, to make this comparison fair, I decided to watch both movies back to back.I can honestly say that the original grips me into the film more. HOWEVER, both Kevin Hart and Jack Black are absolutely incredible in this new film. I actually laughed out loud (too informal to say lol) at some of the jokes. I would however say that the only reason that this was called ""Jumanji"" was to increase profits by producing an all awaited for 'sequel'.I would highly recommend watching this film with the family, but do not expect anything linking back to the original.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

This is the only reason why, I have seen the original as well as the space themed rip-off Zathura, and this was the second worst (you can imagine which was the worst, begins with a Z and ends with suicidal thoughts). It was a largely depressing experience, it was painfully predictable and the slapstick humor was right out of an episode of Tom and Jerry. Jack Black brought the crude element to this which managed to force a few laughs out of me (the reason why this film made it to a 4).Watching Dwayne Johnson neck on with Karen Gillan (this was too predictable for anyone to consider it a spoiler) made my sick in my lap and hopefully some went in my mum's popcorn.As for the Rock and Kev combo we are seeing lately is overrated, and actually it should be left there because it doesn't deserve anymore thought.

902,nihlisgaming,Unexpected but Good!,8,12 February 2018,"When I first saw the first trailer for this movie, I was very skeptic. Being a big fan of the Original Jumanji film, I was very disappointing that they were making a sequel that no one asked for, and that somehow the Jumanji board game turned into a video game.Now seeing the film I have learned that we should be less judgmental about the trailer of a film because there is always a chance of a bad trailer turning into a good film. Even though I almost can't believe that the Jumanji board game was just able to turn into a video game, for some reason watching the film, I just let it slide, because when it does turn into a video game, they handle everything so well that even though I still don't know how to explain how a board game turned into a video game, I was glad that it turned into a video game. The environment was really cool when they got sucked into the game, the cast was also really great, especially the actors playing the video game characters, because they had to play video game characters but have the personality of there teenager selves. Like Jack Black who was a popular girl in High School, but in the video game she is middle-aged fat man (which is one of the funniest parts of the movie). The comedy was also very great, the special effects, everything! I really enjoyed this movie and I regret hating on it when the trailers were out.In the end, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a great film, with a great cast, great environment, cool plot, nice special effects, and many more.

906,tennisperson,Great Movie,10,9 March 2018,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a movie worth watching because of the humor, action, and actors. I recently watched this movie with my friends at Ward Theatre, which was filled with not only children and high school students, but with adults as well. The film stars Dwayne Johnson as Dr. Smolder, Jack Black as Professor Sheldon, Kevin Hart as Moose Finbar, Karen Gillan as Ruby Roundhouse, Nick Jonas as Alex, and Bobby Cannavale. The summary of this movie is that four high school students get trapped in a video game, Jumanji, and the only way they can escape is to work together to finish the game. The students are Spencer Gilpin, Bethany Walker, Martha Kaply, and Anthony Johnson. When they pick their avatars for the game, their characters are completely opposite of who they are. Bethany, a self absorbed instagram girl becomes an overweight male cartographer, Anthony, a tall basketball star becomes a short zoologist, Spencer, a lanky school boy becomes Dwayne Johnson, a muscular adventurer, and Martha, a shy conservative girl becomes a gorgeous martial arts expert. These changes in their true character unlocks an opportunity for humor. As the movie unfolds, the students learn their ""special talents"" and weaknesses. Through trial and error, they discover that they each have only three lives. If they lose all three, they die in real life. The purpose of the game is to obtain the stone, return it to the jaguar statue, and shout, ""Jumanji"". The humor in this movie continues through each scene, even if is an action, serious, or sentimental moment. The humor is also purely innocent and does not get boring at the end. This movie is definitely for people of all ages, and it is a good movie to watch if you just want a good laugh. The action parts are entertaining and the addition of humor make it even better. Assuming they make it out of Jumanji alive, the characters become friends in real life. They take this adventure with them, and it is something that they all share with each other. Spencer, Martha, Bethany, and Anthony are four people who never would have been friends if it was not for this game. They all learn a lot about themselves from this experience and they find a new appreciation for their real life. By pretending to be someone else in the game, their confidence in their actual life grows. I highly recommend this movie to people of all ages because of the humor, action, and actors, and I would definitely watch it again.Although I believe that Jumanji is definitely a must see movie, not everyone has the same opinion. Critics argue that Jumanji is not funny and that it is only amusing for younger children. They claim that the humor gets boring towards the end, but, to me, it does not. Kevin Hart plays a great role in this movie, and he really ties the movie together to make it entertaining. People may not have enjoyed this humor because it is simply not the type of humor they like. It is all opinionated and depends on the viewer. Furthermore, this innocent humor reaches more viewers than other types of humor because it is appropriate for everyone. It is a good movie to watch with family and friends, and it is the type of movie one would watch simply to have a good time. Critics also argue that Jumanji is not like the original movie. Although this is true, the purpose of this second Jumanji is to not make it similar to the original, but to make it different and even better. It is not meant to repeat a film that was already made because it would not be different. Watchers would already know what would happen, and the only difference would be different actors. This new Jumanji was creative and out of the box. Unlike the previous Jumanji movies that were scary and very serious, this one took a spin that turned Jumanji into a video game rather than a board game. It was also more humorous than serious and more enjoyable to watch. This comedic film far surpasses the other Jumanji movies because of both the humor, actio, and actors. Contrary to critic's arguments, Jumanji is definitely a worthwhile film that I highly recommend. The humor, action, and famous actors are all factors that made Jumanji the great movie that it is.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

I see all these terrible reviews (about half) and can't help but wonder what those people were expecting. Seems like a bunch of hoity-toities who probably should go watch Titanic some more and stop trying to ruin the fun for would-be viewers.This movie had me laughing pretty hard. Those who said ""stereotypical characters"" obviously missed the point. Jack Black and Dwayne Johnson stole the show early on and everyone else rocked it as well.I can't help think but the ones who left poor reviews either don't like comedy or maybe don't enjoy the cast, which blows my mind. Maybe there was a little to be desired from the story, but it seems mainly for a younger audience, so...
Take it for what it is and try not to take it too seriously: IT IS A COMEDY, and it is very silly.I like the video game implementations and yes, that made it a little predictable, but didn't steal anything away from the possible enjoyment.
Killer movie. Not to be compared to the original movie, which seemed more aimed for kids, where this new version/sequel (?) was more aimed for comedy. I loved it.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
912,ThmellyAthole,You're Going to Need a SEATBELT,10,8 April 2018,"I used to have an IMDB account when I was a teen - or at least thought I did, but couldn't log on. In any case, I think I've visited here maybe twice in the last five years. Today though, after just getting back from watching this with my almost-grown kids, I had to make an account just to leave this review.To begin, I'll never understand people. I can't believe the negative reviews. How could anyone not have laughed like hell while watching this and still have a pulse? I didn't go in expecting much, but I came out with a smile on my face. The girl is hot, Jack Black ""owns it"", I've never been overly enthused about Kevin Hart, but he was fantastic. and The Rock just knocked it out of the park. I saw one review which reads: ""not a wrestling fan ever so to see 'the rock' in movies, instantly puts me off!"" Does anyone else want to vomit at the inanity, irony and ludicrousness of that statement? Then you have the user who out of 40+ titles he/she has reviewed in the past has only ever rated TWO above three stars. Seriously, if you don't enjoy films and find them so terrible, find a new hobby already. You've got one guy saying the shirt one of the kids wore was outdated. So, I'm guessing one can only wear clothing depicting the current year? Then you have the reviewers who maybe didn't understand the dialogue since they can barely communicate correctly themselves (such gems - I kid you not - as: 'averege'; 'what so ever'; 'family fair' (fare); 'are just wasn't'; 'due to it has'; 'all of there' {their); 'coz it is boring story'; 'no compare with'). Finally, you have the maybe half dozen reviewers who are so caught up in their bigotry that they can't relax and enjoy a film if it isn't whitewashed and who complain about the ""Hollywood liberal agenda of diversity"". Leave the politics at the door, man.
In short, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle was a fantastic hour or more of rip-riding fun and laughs.Except for one very funny moment, Dwayne Johnson retires his wrestling persona for this film and instead, provides a smoldering and intense performance, riddled with good-natured hilarity as the lead in this film. Gillan was great in Doctor Who, and although I thought she was the weakest of both characters and actors in this film, she still held her own and looked fantastic doing so. She has one of those faces you can't help but love. Kevin Hart was fantastic as the diminutive valet and looking back, I think he was somehow involved in every funny moment in which I laughed the hardest. Finally, the master, the maestro (though I never really was a fan prior to this), Jack Black plays the teen beauty queen with 100% commitment and to perfection.10/10 and definitely a film I will be purchasing right after I click ""Submit"". You can never have enough laughter in life, and Jumanji, Welcome to the Jungle delivers barrels-full.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

And with so many films, we must think the performance should suffer.

I will not spoiler anything about the plot. You have to find it out for yourself.Buit i can say that it is amusing to watch ""The Rock"" in another role as 
the destroyer from the action movies.Excuse me for my bad english skills.Yours sincerely

917,typap,Better than expected,8,5 June 2018,Went into movie thinking it was gonna be a horrible sequel. Turned out to be different storyline from original. And even more funny than original. Also good character development for some characters,Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

921,discipleofkruphix,The definition of Cliché and Cheese,3,22 July 2018,"The main problem here is that the film is filled with typical cheesy lines, as well as predictable plot lines. This essentially wastes the comedic talents of Kevin Hart and Jack Black, and Karen Gillan's character is far from the flippant and sassy character of Amy Pond that people tend to expect. What we end up getting is just run of the mill characters with no depth, acting as stand-ins. Anyways, the plot line seems to be forced (the tension between Spencer and Fridge seems to have arisen out of nowhere, same w the affection between Spencer and Martha). Ironic that a movie with a video game theme has a worse storyline than games such as WoW or Starcraft.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle

923,lfoake,"Not what I expected, but hilarious",9,2 August 2018,"I thought the humor was the greatest. Jack Black probably stole the show with his portrayal of a teenage girl. He was so much fun! Of course, it was way off the original movie, but that honestly doesn't bother me when a movie is done well.",Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle
